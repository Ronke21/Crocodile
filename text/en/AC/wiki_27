<doc id="11515" wikidata="Q21067567" url="?curid=11515" title="Glossary of French words and expressions in English">
<text>Many words in the English vocabulary are of French origin, most coming from the Anglo-Norman spoken by the upper classes in England for several hundred years after the Norman Conquest, before the language settled into what became Modern English. English words of French origin, such as &quot;art&quot;, &quot;competition&quot;, &quot;force&quot;, &quot;money&quot;, and &quot;table&quot; are pronounced according to English rules of phonology, rather than French, and English speakers commonly use them without any awareness of their French origin.

This article covers French words and phrases that have entered the English lexicon without ever losing their character as Gallicisms: they remain unmistakably &quot;French&quot; to an English speaker. They are most common in written English, where they retain French diacritics and are usually printed in italics. In spoken English, at least some attempt is generally made to pronounce them as they would sound in French. An entirely English pronunciation is regarded as a solecism.

Some of the entries were never &quot;good French&quot;, in the sense of being grammatical, idiomatic French usage. Others were once normal French but have either become very old-fashioned or have acquired different meanings and connotations in the original language, to the extent that a native French speaker would not understand them, either at all or in the intended sense.

It means &quot;in an unaltered way&quot; and can be used either for people or things. For people, it rather refers to a person who does not use make-up or artificial manners (&quot;un entretien au naturel&quot; = a backstage interview). For things, it means that they have not been altered. Often used in cooking, like &quot;thon au naturel&quot;: canned tuna without any spices or oil. Also in heraldry, meaning &quot;in natural colours&quot;, especially flesh colour, which is not one of the &quot;standard&quot; colours of heraldry.
; auteur: A film director, specifically one who controls most aspects of a film, or other controller of an artistic situation. The English connotation derives from French film theory. It was popularized in the journal &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;: auteur theory maintains that directors like Hitchcock exert a level of creative control equivalent to the author of a literary work. In French, the word means &quot;author&quot;, but some expressions like &quot;cinéma d&#x27;auteur&quot; are also in use.
; : a scary or unpopular person, idea, or thing, or the archetypal scary monster in a story; literally &quot;black beast.&quot; In French, &quot;être la bête noire de quelqu&#x27;un&quot; (&quot;to be somebody&#x27;s black beast&quot;) means that you&#x27;re particularly hated by this person or this person has a strong aversion against you, regardless of whether you&#x27;re scary or not. The dictionary of the Académie française admits its use only for people, though other dictionaries admit it for things or ideas too. It also means that one is repeatedly defeated by a person, who is thus considered their archenemy (for instance, &quot;Nadal is the bête noire of Roger Federer&quot;).
; boutique: a clothing store, usually selling designer/one off pieces rather than mass-produced clothes. Can also describe a quirky and/or upmarket hotel. In French, it can describe any shop, clothing or otherwise. The expression &quot;hôtel-boutique&quot; can be used to refer to upmarket hotels, but the word is recent and not as widespread as the equivalent expression boutique hotel.
; boutonnière: In English, a boutonnière is a flower placed in the buttonhole of a suit jacket. In French, a boutonnière is the buttonhole itself. Yet the French expression &quot;Une fleur à la boutonnière&quot; has an equivalent meaning.
; c&#x27;est magnifique, mais ce n&#x27;est pas la guerre: &quot;it is magnificent, but it is not war&quot; — quotation from Marshal Pierre Bosquet commenting on the charge of the Light Brigade. Unknown quotation in French.
; : An issue arousing widespread controversy or heated public debate, lit. &#x27;famous cause&#x27;. It is correct grammatically, but the expression is not used in French.
; chacun à son goût: &quot;each to his own taste,&quot; i.e. &quot;de gustibus non est disputandum&quot; or &quot;there&#x27;s no accounting for tastes.&quot; The French phrase was popularized by its use in the aria &quot;Ich lade gern mir Gäste ein&quot; from Johann Strauss&#x27;s operetta &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (1874). The correct expressions in French would be &quot;chacun ses goûts / à chacun ses goûts / à chacun son goût&quot;: &quot;to each his/her own taste(s).&quot;
; chanson: a classical &quot;art song&quot;, equiv. to the German &quot;Lied&quot; or the Italian &quot;aria&quot;; or, in Russian, a cabaret-style sung narrative, usually rendered by a guttural male voice with guitar accompaniment. In French, it can be used to refer to any song, but it also refers to the same music genre as in English (someone practicing this genre being generally called a &quot;chansonnier&quot; in Quebec, especially if they sing at a restaurant or cabaret).
; château: a manor house or a country house of nobility or gentry, with or without fortifications, originally—and still most frequently—in French-speaking regions. The word château is also used for castles in French, so where clarification is needed, the term château fort (&quot;strong castle&quot;) is used to describe a castle.
; chef: in English, a person who cooks professionally for other people. In French the word means &quot;head&quot; or &quot;chief&quot;; a professional cook is a &quot;cuisinier&quot; (lit. &quot;cook&quot;), &quot;chef-cuisinier&quot; referring to a head cook. Also, sous-chef, the second-in-command, directly under the head chef. Traditionally, &quot;chef&quot; used to means the head, for example a &quot;couvre-chef&quot; is a headgear, but by extension it&#x27;s often used in job titles, military ranks, for a person in charge or who leads a group of people: &quot;chef d&#x27;État&quot; (lit. &quot;Head of State&quot; and &quot;Chief of State&quot;), &quot;chef d&#x27;entreprise&quot; (&quot;Business executive&quot;), &quot;chef d&#x27;orchestre&quot; (Conductor of an Orchestra), &quot;sergeant-chef&quot; (Staff Sergeant), &quot;chef de gare&quot; (stationmaster), &quot;chef de famille&quot; (head of household), etc. More casually in a work context, a &quot;chef&quot; is a boss.
; cinq à sept: extraconjugal affair between five and seven pm. In French, though it can also mean this, it primarily means any relaxing time with friends between the end of work and the beginning of the marital obligations. In Quebec French, it is also used as a synonym for &quot;Happy Hour&quot; by bars and restaurants that serve discounted drinks after working hours.
; claque: a group of admirers; in French, &quot;la claque&quot; is a group of people paid to applaud or disturb a piece at the theatre, though the common meaning of &quot;claque&quot; is &quot;a slap&quot;; &quot;clique&quot; is used in this sense (but in a pejorative way).
; connoisseur: an expert in wines, fine arts, or other matters of culture; a person of refined taste. It is spelled &quot;connaisseur&quot; in modern French (lit. &quot;someone who knows&quot;).
; corsage: A bouquet of flowers worn on a woman&#x27;s dress or worn around her wrist. In French, it refers to a woman&#x27;s chest (from shoulder to waist) and, by extension, the part of a woman&#x27;s garment that covers this area.
; coup de main (pl. coups de main): a surprise attack. In French, &quot;[donner] un coup de main&quot; means &quot;[to give] a hand&quot; (to give assistance). Even if the English meaning exists as well (as in &quot;faire le coup de main&quot;), it is old-fashioned.
; coup d&#x27;état (pl. coups d&#x27;état):a sudden change in government by force; literally &quot;hit (blow) of state.&quot; French uses the capital É, because the use of a capital letter alters the meaning of the word (État: a State, as in a country; état: a state of being). It also cannot be shortened as &quot;coup&quot; as is often the case in English- because this literally means a &quot;hit&quot; in French, but can be used figuratively to mean many more things.
; :first public performance of an entertainment personality or group. In French, it means &quot;beginning.&quot; The English meaning of the word exists only when in the plural form: &quot;[faire] ses débuts [sur scène]&quot; (to make one&#x27;s débuts on the stage). The English meaning and usage also extends to sports to denote a player who is making their first appearance for a team or at an event.
; décolletage: a low-cut neckline, cleavage. In French it means: 1. action of lowering a female garment&#x27;s neckline; 2. Agric.: cutting leaves from some cultivated roots such as beets, carrots, etc.; 3. Tech. Operation consisting of making screws, bolts, etc. one after another out of a single bar of metal on a parallel lathe. A low-cut neckline, or its shape, would in French be called &quot;un décolleté&quot; (noun and adjective): &quot;un décolleté profond&quot;, a deep décolletage; &quot;une robe très décolletée&quot;, a dress with very low neckline.
; démarche: a decisive step. In French, it means a preparing step (often used in the plural form), a specific set of steps to get a specific result (can be used in the singular form, sometimes the expression &quot;marche à suivre&quot; (lit. &quot;step to follow&quot;) will be preferred), or a distinctive way of walking.
; dépanneur: a neighbourhood general/convenience store, term used in eastern Canada (often shortened to &quot;dép&quot; or &quot;dep&quot;). This term is commonly used in Canadian French; however, in France, it means a repairman or tow truck operator. In France, a convenience store would be a &quot;supérette&quot; or &quot;épicerie [de quartier]&quot;.
; émigré: one who has emigrated for political reasons. French also use the word &quot;exilé&quot; (exiled) or &quot;réfugié&quot; (refugee) or even &quot;exilé politique&quot; or &quot;réfugié politique&quot;.
; encore: A request to repeat a performance, as in &quot;Encore!&quot;, lit. &#x27;again&#x27;; also used to describe additional songs played at the end of a gig. Francophones would say « Une autre ! » (&#x27;Another one!&#x27;) or «Bis !» to request « un rappel » or « un bis ».
; : in a mass or group, all together. In French, &quot;masse&quot; refers only to a physical mass, whether for people or objects. It cannot be used for something immaterial, like, for example, the voice: &quot;they all together said &#x27;get out&#x27;&quot; would be translated as &quot;ils ont dit &#x27;dehors&#x27; en chœur&quot; ([like a chorus]). Also, &quot;en masse&quot; refers to numerous people or objects (a crowd or a mountain of things). In colloquial Québécois French, it means &quot;a bunch&quot; (as in &quot;il y avait du monde en masse&quot;, &quot;there was a bunch of people&quot;).
; en suite:as a set (not to be confused with &quot;ensuite&quot;, meaning &quot;then&quot;). Can refer, in particular, to hotel rooms with attached private bathroom, especially in Britain where hotels without private facilities are more common than in North America. In French, &quot;suite&quot;, when in the context of a hotel, already means several rooms following each other. &quot;J&#x27;ai loué une suite au Ritz&quot; would be translated as &quot;I rented a suite at the Ritz.&quot; &quot;En suite&quot; is not grammatically incorrect in French, but it is not an expression in itself and it is not used. Also used in British English to denote a bathroom that is accessible directly from the master bedroom of a house (usually with a connecting door), rather than by a separate entrance.
; entrée: lit. &quot;entrance&quot;; in French, the first dish that starts a meal, i.e. the entrance to the meal. It can refer to a set of bites or small snacks, or a small dish served before a main course. The main dish or &quot;plat de résistance&quot; comes after the entrée. In American English, the meaning has migrated to &quot;main dish&quot;. In other varieties of English it maintains its French meaning.
; épée: a fencing weapon descended from the duelling sword. In French, apart from fencing (the sport) the term is more generic: it means sword.
; escritoire: a writing table. It is spelt &quot;écritoire&quot; in modern French.
; exposé: a published exposure of a fraud or scandal (past participle of &quot;to expose&quot;); in French refers to a talk or a report on any kind of subject.
; femme: a stereotypically effeminate gay man or lesbian (slang, pronounced as written). In French, &quot;femme&quot; (pronounced &#x27;fam&#x27;) means &quot;woman.&quot;
; fin de siècle: comparable to (but not exactly the same as) turn-of-the-century but with a connotation of decadence, usually applied to the period from 1890 through 1910. In French, it means &quot;end of the century&quot;, but it isn&#x27;t a recognized expression as such. The French expression &quot;ambiance [de] fin de règne&quot; (lit. &quot;end-of-reign atmosphere&quot;) also has a light connotation of boredom and decadence.
; : a strength, a strong point, typically of a person, from the French &quot;fort(e)&quot; (strong) and/or Italian &quot;forte&quot; (strong, esp. &quot;loud&quot; in music) and/or Latin &quot;forte&quot; (neuter form of &quot;fortis&quot;, strong). French uses &quot;fort(e)&quot; for both people and objects.
: According to Merriam Webster Dictionary, &quot;In &quot;forte&quot; we have a word derived from French that in its &quot;strong point&quot; sense has no entirely satisfactory pronunciation. Usage writers have denigrated \&#x27;for-&quot;tA\ and \&#x27;for-tE\ because they reflect the influence of the Italian-derived &quot;forte&quot;. Their recommended pronunciation \&#x27;fort\, however, does not exactly reflect French either: the French would write the word &quot;le fort&quot; and would rhyme it with English &quot;for&quot; [French doesn&#x27;t pronounce the final &quot;t&quot;]. All are standard, however. In British English \&#x27;fo-&quot;tA\ and \&#x27;fot\ predominate; \&#x27;for-&quot;tA\ and \for-&#x27;tA\ are probably the most frequent pronunciations in American English.&quot;
: The New Oxford Dictionary of English derives it from fencing. In French, &quot;le fort d&#x27;une épée&quot; is the third of a blade nearer the hilt, the strongest part of the sword used for parrying.

; hors d&#x27;oeuvres: term used for the snacks served with drinks before a meal. Literally &quot;outside of the work&quot;. The French use &quot;apéritif&quot; to refer to the time before a meal and the drinks consumed during that time, yet &quot;hors d&#x27;œuvre&quot; is a synonym of &quot;entrée&quot; in French and means the first dish that starts a meal. At home in family circles it means more specifically seasoned salads taken as a starter. In Québécois French, &quot;apéritif&quot; refers to the drink only, and &quot;hors-d&#x27;œuvre&quot; (usually plural) refers to a set of bites, while an &quot;entrée&quot; is a small dish (an &quot;entrée&quot; can be made as &quot;hors-d&#x27;œuvres&quot;, but not all of them are).
; lavatoire or : A once commonly used British term for a toilet or water closet. Before the age of the internet, it was commonly believed, and widely taught in schools in Britain, that the word &quot;toilet&quot; was a rather vulgar corruption of the French word &quot;toilettes&quot; and that &quot;lavatory&quot; was the correct expression to use because it was much closer in meaning to the French the word it was derived from, &quot;&quot;lavatoire&quot;,&quot; which was supposed to mean &quot;to wash, or to clean, yourself.&quot; Actually, though the word &quot;lavatoire&quot; does exist in French, it never meant a toilet or a bathroom. The &quot;lavatoire&quot; was the holy stone upon which the bodies of ecclesiastics, priest and members of the clergy, were once washed after their deaths, in order to prepare them for the afterlife, for their journey to heaven.
; marquee:the sign above a theater that tells you what is playing. From &quot;marquise&quot;, which means not only a marchioness but also an awning. Theater buildings are generally old and nowadays there is never such a sign above them; there is only the advertisement for the play (&quot;l&#x27;affiche&quot;). In English, means a temporary structure (often made of canvas or similar material) which is erected to host an event outdoors, especially in the UK, where such events can often be affected by weather conditions (pronounced &quot;mar-key&quot;).
; : &quot;yearning for the mud&quot;; attraction to what is unworthy, crude or degrading. Though grammatically correct, it is not used in French.
; objet trouvé: an ordinary object, such as a piece of driftwood, a shell, or a manufactured article, that is treated as an &quot;objet d&#x27;art&quot; because it is aesthetically pleasing. In French, &quot;les objets trouvés&quot;, short for &quot;le bureau des objets trouvés&quot;, means the lost-and-found, the lost property.
; : out of the ordinary, unusual. In French, it means outraged (for a person) or exaggerated, extravagant, overdone (for a thing, esp. a praise, an actor&#x27;s style of acting, etc.); in that second meaning, belongs to &quot;literary&quot; style.
; passé: out of fashion. The correct expression in French is &quot;passé de mode.&quot; Passé means past, passed, or (for a colour) faded.
; peignoir: a woman&#x27;s dressing gown. Peignoir means bathrobe in French (for either sex, in absorbent material), whereas a dressing gown is called &quot;robe de chambre&quot; also regardless of sex. Peignoir and robe de chambre may be used interchangeably, as bathrobe and dressing gown in english.
; pièce d&#x27;occasion: &quot;occasional piece&quot;; item written or composed for a special occasion. In French, it means &quot;second-hand hardware.&quot; Can be shortened as &quot;pièce d&#x27;occas″&quot; or even &quot;occas″&quot; (pronounced /okaz/).
; portmanteau (pl. portmanteaux): In English, a portmanteau is a large piece of luggage for clothes that opens (like a book or a diptych) into two parts. From this literal sense, Lewis Carroll, in his novel &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, playfully coined a further figurative sense for &quot;portmanteau&quot;: a word that fuses two or more words or parts of words to give a combined meaning. (For example, &quot;Brexit&quot; or &quot;emoticon&quot;). In French, &quot;portemanteau&quot; (lit. &quot;carry-coat&quot;) was originally a person who carried the royal coat or dress train; now a large suitcase; more often, a clothes hanger. The equivalent of the English &quot;portmanteau word&quot; is &quot;un mot-valise&quot; (lit. &quot;word-suitcase&quot;).
; potpourri: medley, mixture; French write it &quot;pot-pourri&quot;, literally &#x27;rotten pot&#x27;: primarily a pot in which different kinds of flowers or spices are put to dry for years for the scent.
; : a concise summary. In French, when talking about a school course, it means an abridged book about the matter. Literally, &quot;précis&quot; means precise, accurate.
; première: refers to the first performance of a play, a film, etc. &quot;La première&quot; is used in same way in French, but it more generally means &quot;the first&quot;.
; : a type of author intrusion in which a writer inserts a character to argue the author&#x27;s viewpoint; alter ego, sometimes called &#x27;author avatar&#x27;. In French, a &quot;raisonneur&quot; is a character in a play who stands for morality and reason, i.e., not necessarily the author&#x27;s point of view. The first meaning of this word though is a man (fem. &quot;raisonneuse&quot;) who overdoes reasonings, who tires by objecting with numerous arguments to every order.
; : lit. searched; obscure; pretentious. In French, means &#x27;sophisticated&#x27; or &#x27;delicate&#x27;, or simply &#x27;studied&#x27;, without the negative connotations of the English.
; : lit. &quot;present yourself&quot; or &quot;proceed to&quot;; a meeting, appointment, or date in French. In English, it generally endorses a mysterious overtone and refers to a one-on-one meeting with someone for another purpose than a date. Always hyphenated in French: &quot;rendez-vous&quot;. Its only accepted abbreviation in French is RDV.
; reprise:repetition of previous music in a suite, programme, etc. and also applied to an actor who resumes a role that they have played previously. In French, it may mean an alternate version of a piece of music, or a cover version, or the rebroadcast of a show, piece or movie that was originally broadcast a while ago (although the term &quot;rediffusion&quot; is generally preferred, especially when talking about something on television). To express the repetition of a previous musical theme, French would exclusively use the Italian term coda.
; résumé: in North American English, a document listing one&#x27;s qualifications for employment. In French, it means summary; French speakers would use instead &quot;curriculum vitæ&quot;, or its abbreviation, C.V. (like most other English speakers).
; (also risque): sexually suggestive; in French, the meaning of &quot;risqué&quot; is &quot;risky&quot;, with no sexual connotation. Francophones use instead &quot;osé&quot; (lit. &quot;daring&quot;) or sometimes &quot;dévergondé&quot; (very formal language). &quot;Osé&quot;, unlike &quot;dévergondé&quot;, cannot be used for people themselves, only for things (such as pictures) or attitudes.
; &quot;rouge&quot; (lit. &quot;red&quot;) : 1) a rouge is red makeup, also called blusher. &quot;Rouge à lèvres&quot; is French for &quot;lipstick&quot;, even if the lipstick is not red at all. The French equivalent to the English meaning is &quot;fard à joues&quot;; 2) in Canadian football, a rouge is awarded when the ball is kicked into the end zone by any legal means, other than a successful field goal, and the receiving team does not return or kick the ball out of its end zone.
; séance : a gathering, usually using a &#x27;medium&#x27;, attempting to communicate with the dead. In French, the word means &#x27;sitting&#x27; and usually refers to any kind of meeting or session.
; table d&#x27;hôte (pl. tables d&#x27;hôte): in English, when used it usually refers to type of meal: a full-course meal offered at a fixed price. However, in French, it refers to a type of lodging: the closest English equivalent would be &quot;a bed &amp; breakfast&quot; or &quot;B&amp;B.&quot; The origin of the meaning (for French speakers) is that at a table d&#x27;hôte (literally &quot;table of the house&quot; or &quot;table of the host&quot;), unlike at a full-service purpose-built hotel, all patrons eat together at the host&#x27;s table, whatever the family have prepared for themselves (typically traditional regional dishes). Indeed, in France today a lodging labeled &quot;table d&#x27;hôte&quot; might perhaps not even offer food; the appellation meaning what an English-speaker would think of as a &quot;bed &amp; breakfast -style&quot; family-home lodging (as opposed to a purpose-built hotel). In Quebec, &quot;table d&#x27;hôte&quot; generally has the same meaning as in English, the expression &quot;couette et café&quot; (lit. &quot;duvet and coffee&quot;) is generally used to talk about B&amp;B style accommodations, where the English expression is not used.
; tableau vivant (pl. tableaux vivants, often shortened as &quot;tableau&quot;): in drama, a scene where actors remain motionless as if in a picture. &quot;Tableau&quot; means painting, &quot;tableau vivant&quot;, living painting. In French, it is an expression used in body painting.
; touché: acknowledgment of an effective counterpoint. In French, used for &quot;emotionally touched&quot;.
; vignette: a brief description; a short scene. In French, it is a small picture or a thumbnail. By extension a vignette is the name of a compulsory road tax in the form of a small sticker affixed to a vehicle windscreen, which is now also used in several European countries.

== Found only in English ==

; aide-de-camp: &quot;camp assistant&quot;; in the army, a military assistant to a senior military officer (heads of State are considered military officers because of their status as head of the army). In Canada, it may also refer to the honorary position a person holds as a personal assistant to a high civil servant. It exists in French too but is written &quot;aide de camp&quot; (without any hyphens).
; apprise: &quot;to inform&quot;; used to substitute the verb &quot;to inform&quot; when the information is crucial. Its French meaning is the feminine past participle of &quot;to learn&quot; [apprendre]. In English, when followed by an object it is used with the preposition &quot;of&quot;. Example without object: &quot;Please, apprise me&quot;. Example with object: &quot;he apprised of it&quot;.
; cinquefoil: five-petal, five-leaf flower of the genus Potentilla, family Rosaceae; also a circular 5-lobed ornamental design. Spelled &quot;quintefeuille&quot; in French.
; : &quot;cry from the heart&quot;: an impassioned outcry, as of entreaty or protest. In French, the exact expression is &quot;cri du cœur&quot;.
; demi-monde: a class of women of ill repute; a fringe group or subculture. Fell out of use in the French language in the 19th century. Frenchmen still use &quot;une demi-mondaine&quot; to qualify a woman that lives (exclusively or partially) off the commerce of her charms but in a high-life style.
; double entendre: a figure of speech wherein a word or phrases can be taken to have two distinct coherent meanings, most often in a fashion that is suggestive and/or ironic. &quot;Entendre&quot; is an infinitive verb (&quot;to hear&quot;), not a noun; a correct rendering would be &quot;à double entente&quot;, an adjectival phrase meaning &quot;of a double understanding or double interpretation&quot; (literally, &quot;with a double hearing&quot;). The modern French phrase is &quot;à double sens&quot;.
; (of): &quot;in place (of)&quot;; partially translated from the existing French phrase &quot;au lieu (de)&quot;.
; léger de main (legerdemain): &quot;light of hand&quot;: sleight of hand, usually in the context of deception or the art of stage magic tricks. Meaningless in French; the equivalent is &quot;un tour de passe-passe&quot;. 
; maître d&#x27;:translates literally as &quot;master o&quot;&#x27;. The French term for head waiter (the manager of the service side of a restaurant) is &quot;maître d&#x27;hôtel&quot; (literally &quot;master of the house&quot; or &quot;master of the establishment&quot;); French never uses &quot;d stand-alone. Most often used in American English and its usage in the UK is rare.
; negligée:A robe or a dressing gown, usually of sheer or soft fabric for women, or a nightdress. As with lingerie, the usage of the word suggests the garment is alluring or fancy. French uses &quot;négligé&quot; (masculine form) or &quot;nuisette&quot;. In French, the word &quot;négligée&quot; qualifies a woman who neglects her appearance.
; succès de scandale: &quot;Success through scandal&quot;; Francophones might use &quot;succès par médisance&quot;.
; voir dire: a trial within a trial, or (in America) jury selection (Law French). Literally &quot;to speak the truth.&quot; (Anglo-Norman &quot;voir&quot; [&quot;truth&quot;] is etymologically unrelated to the modern French &quot;voir&quot; [&quot;to see&quot;].) In modern American court procedure, the examination of prospective jurors for their qualification to serve, including inherent biases, views and predelictions; during this examination, each prospective juror must &quot;speak the truth&quot; so that counsel and the court may decide whether they should remain on the jury or be excused. In England and Wales, the expression is used to refer to a &quot;trial within a trial&quot;, during which a judge hears evidence in the absence of the jury, typically to decide whether a certain piece of evidence should be allowed to be presented to the jury or not. For example, a judge might hold a &quot;voir dire&quot; to determine whether a confession has been extracted from a defendant by an unfair inducement in order to decide whether the jury should hear evidence of the confession or not.

== French phrases in international air-sea rescue ==

International authorities have adopted a number of words and phrases from French for use by speakers of all languages in voice communications during air-sea rescues. Note that the &quot;phonetic&quot; versions of spelling are presented as shown and not the .

; SECURITAY: (&quot;sécurité&quot;, &quot;safety&quot;) the following is a safety message or warning, the lowest level of danger.
; PAN PAN: (&quot;panne&quot;, &quot;breakdown&quot;) the following is a message concerning a danger to a person or ship, the next level of danger.
; MAYDAY: (&quot;[venez] m&#x27;aider&quot;, come to help me&quot;; &quot;aidez-moi&quot; means &quot;help me&quot;) the following is a message of extreme urgency, the highest level of danger. &quot;(MAYDAY is used on voice channels for the same uses as SOS on Morse channels.)&quot;
; SEELONCE: (&quot;silence&quot;, &quot;silence&quot;) keep this channel clear for air-sea rescue communications.
; SEELONCE FEE NEE: (&quot;silence fini&quot;, &quot;silence is over&quot;) this channel is now available again.

; MAY DEE CAL: (&quot;médical&quot;, &quot;medical&quot;) medical assistance needed.

It is a serious breach in most countries, and in international zones, to use any of these phrases without justification.

&quot;See Mayday (distress signal) for a more detailed explanation.&quot;

<text>The South African financial rand was the most visible part of a system of capital controls. Although the financial rand was abolished in March 1995, some capital controls remain in place. These capital controls are locally referred to as &quot;exchange controls&quot;, although the system has since 1995 moved towards surveillance — recording and reporting to the authorities of foreign currency transactions — rather than control.

Capital controls have been in place in South Africa in various guises on an uninterrupted basis since the outbreak of World War II, when Great Britain and its dominions implemented the Sterling area.

Following the 1960 Sharpeville massacre, South Africa experienced significant outflows of foreign exchange on the capital account of the balance of payments and instituted an additional level of capital controls, known as the Blocked Rand system. This had the principal effect of blocking outflows of capital to the other countries in the Sterling Area, notably Britain.

To some extent the Blocked Rand system mirrored Germany&#x27;s Reichsbank system introduced under Hjalmar Schacht in 1937, called &quot;aski&quot; accounts — short for &quot;Ausländer Sonderkonten für Inlandszahlungen&quot; (&quot;foreigners&#x27; special accounts for inland payments&quot;). In other words, creating a closed loop system that did not create a claim on the foreign exchange reserves of the Third Reich, or in this case South Africa.

The report of the De Kock Commission on Exchange Controls tabled in November 1978, proposed a gradual easing of exchange controls. This saw the replacement of the Blocked Rand by the Financial Rand in early 1979. In line with this policy, the Financial Rand itself was abolished in 1983 and non-residents could repatriate the majority of their South African investments via the Commercial Rand.

This easing was, however, short-lived and the Financial Rand system was re-introduced on 1 September 1985. The outflows during 1984–1985 were largely the result of economic sanctions in response to apartheid. At the same time, the government enacted the exchange controls. Investments in South Africa by foreigners could only be sold for financial rand.

The financial rand system provided for two exchange rates for the rand — one for current account transactions and one for capital account transactions for non-residents. Investments made in South Africa by non-residents could only be sold for financial rand, and limitations were placed on the convertibility of financial rand into foreign currencies. Financial rand had the ISO 4217 currency code ZAL. Financial rand had a previous life, from January 1979 to February 1983. The 1985 crisis coincided with a default (then called a &quot;standstill&quot;) on foreign debt by the apartheid government.

<text>This is a list of FIPS 10-4 country codes for &quot;Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions&quot;.

The two-letter country codes were used by the US government for geographical data processing in many publications, such as the CIA World Factbook. The standard is also known as DAFIF 0413 ed 7 Amdt. No. 3 (Nov 2003) and as DIA 65-18 (Defense Intelligence Agency, 1994, &quot;Geopolitical Data Elements and Related Features&quot;).

The FIPS standard includes both the codes for independent countries (similar but often incompatible with the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard) and the codes for top-level subdivision of the countries (similar to but usually incompatible with the ISO 3166-2 standard). The ISO 3166 codes are used by the United Nations and for Internet top-level country code domains.

Non-sovereign entities are in italics.

On September 2, 2008, FIPS 10-4 was one of ten standards withdrawn by NIST as a Federal Information Processing Standard. It was replaced in the U.S. Government by the Geopolitical Entities, Names, and Codes (GENC), which is based on ISO 3166.

<text>Fair Isle ( ; ), sometimes Fairisle, is the southernmost Shetland island, situated roughly from the Shetland Mainland and about from North Ronaldsay (the most northerly island of Orkney). 

The entire archipelago lies off the northernmost coast of Scotland, in the North Sea. As the most remote inhabited island in the United Kingdom (and among the most northerly settlements in Great Britain), Fair Isle is known for its wild bird observatory, interesting historic shipwrecks, Scottish and Shetland-style traditional music, and its traditional style of knitting. The island has been owned by the National Trust for Scotland since 1954.

==History==

Fair Isle has been occupied since Neolithic times, which is remarkable given the lack of raw materials on the island, although it is surrounded by rich fishing waters. There are two known Iron Age sites: a promontory fort at Landberg and the foundations of a house underlying an early Christian settlement at Kirkigeo.

Most of the place names date from after the 9th-century Norse settlement of the Northern Isles. By that time the croft lands had clearly been in use for centuries.

Between the 9th and 15th centuries, Fair Isle was a Norwegian possession. In 1469, Shetland, along with Orkney, was part of the dowry of the King of Denmark&#x27;s daughter, Margaret, on her marriage to James III of Scotland.

On 20 August 1588 the flagship of the Spanish Armada, &quot;El Gran Grifón&quot;, was shipwrecked in the cove of Stroms Hellier, forcing its 300 sailors to spend six weeks living with the islanders. The wreck was discovered in 1970. The large Canadian sailing ship &quot;Black Watch&quot; was wrecked on Fair Isle in 1877.

In 1862 around 40% of the population migrated to New Brunswick.

Fair Isle was bought by the National Trust for Scotland in 1954 from George Waterston, the founder of the bird observatory. In that decade, electricity was not yet available to residents and only some homes had running water; the population was declining at a level that created concern.

The population decreased steadily from about 400 in 1900. There were around 55 permanent residents on the island in 2015, the majority of whom were crofters. In April 2021, the population was 48 and the island became the first place in the UK all of whose adult inhabitants had been vaccinated against COVID-19. The island has 14 scheduled monuments, ranging from the earliest signs of human activity to the remains of a Second World War radar station. The two automated lighthouses are protected as listed buildings.

The island houses a series of high-technology relay stations carrying vital TV, radio, telephone and military communication links between Shetland, Orkney and the Scottish mainland. In this respect it continues its historic role as a signal station, linking the mainland and the more remote island groups. In 1976, when television relay equipment was updated to permit colour broadcasts to Shetland, the new equipment was housed in former Second World War radar station buildings on Fair Isle. Many television signals are relayed from Orkney to Shetland (rather than from the Scottish mainland) via Orkney&#x27;s Keelylang Hill transmitter station.

=== Wartime military role ===
During the Second World War, the Royal Navy built two radar stations on top of Ward Hill (), which operated from February and March 1940 and played an important role in detecting German bombers approaching Scapa Flow on 8 and 10 April 1940. The ruined buildings and Nissen huts are still present. A cable-operated narrow-gauge railway lies disused; it was once used to send supplies up to the summit of Ward Hill.

On 17 January 1941, a German Heinkel He 111 bomber, modified as a meteorological aircraft, crashed on the island; wreckage remains on the crash-site. The aircraft had been flying on a routine weather reconnaissance flight from its base at Oldenburg in Germany. It was intercepted by RAF Hawker Hurricane fighters from 3 Squadron, based at RAF Sumburgh; both of the aircraft&#x27;s engines were damaged and several of the five crew were wounded. The pilot managed to make a crash-landing on Fair Isle to avoid ditching his crippled aircraft in the sea. Two crew died and three survived. The dead crew were buried in the island&#x27;s churchyard; the survivors were detained by the islanders and remained for several days until weather conditions allowed them to be taken off the island by means of the Lerwick Lifeboat. Before the Lerwick boat reached the island, two separate boats from Orkney ran aground while making their way to collect the prisoners of war.

The South Light was a target. During raids, the wife of an assistant keeper was killed in 1941 and their daughter was injured; in 1942, the wife of another keeper and their daughter also died in a raid.

On 22 July 1941, Spitfire X5401 piloted by Flying Officer M. D. S. Hood crash-landed on Fair Isle returning from a reconnaissance mission over Ålesund, Norway. The pilot recalled the crash site to be adjacent to the track which crossed the airstrip. The cause of the crash proved to be a leak of coolant, which resulted in the engine overheating. The aircraft was recovered and flew again, and the pilot survived the war.

==Geography==

Fair Isle is administratively part of the parish of Dunrossness, Shetland, and is roughly equidistant from Sumburgh Head, some to the northeast on the Mainland of Shetland and North Ronaldsay, Orkney, some to the southwest. Fair Isle is long and wide. It has an area of , making it the tenth-largest of the Shetland Islands. It gives its name to one of the British Sea Areas. 

Most of the islanders live in the crofts on the southern half of the island, the northern half consisting of rocky moorland. The western coast consists of cliffs of up to in height, Ward Hill at being the highest point of the island and its only Marilyn. On the eastern coast the almost detached headland of Sheep Rock rises to .

===Climate===
Fair Isle experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;), bordering on a subpolar oceanic climate (&quot;Cfc&quot;), with cool summers and mild winters. This is especially pronounced because of its location far from any sizeable landmass; Fair Isle has the smallest overall temperature range (least continental) of any weather station in the British Isles: a maximum of and a minimum of since 1951. This 60+ year temperature span is actually smaller than many places in inland southern England will record within a given three-month period. To further illustrate how extreme the maritime moderation at Fair Isle is, a rural location near the coastline in Northern Stockholm County on a similar latitude in Sweden broke Fair Isle&#x27;s then all-time records in both directions within a 48-hour period between 26 and 28 April 2014. 

On 19 July 2022, a maximum temperature of was registered in Fair Isle.

The lowest temperature recorded in recent years was in February 2010. Rainfall, at under , is lower than one might expect for a location that is often in the main path of Atlantic depressions. This is explained by a lack of heavy convective rainfall during spring and summer months due to the absence of warm surface conditions.

Fair Isle&#x27;s ocean moderation is so strong that areas on the same latitudes in the Scandinavian inland less than to the east have average summer highs higher than Fair Isle&#x27;s all-time record temperature, for example the Norwegian capital of Oslo and the Swedish capital of Stockholm. The all-time low is uniquely mild for European locations on the 59th parallel north. The winter daily means are comparable to many areas as far south in the British Isles as south-central England, because of the extreme maritime moderation. It is in hardiness zone 9b or 10a (compared to 8b for the Faroes, 7b or 8a for Stockholm, and 1b for parts of Canada, all on or near the 60th parallel north. Central Florida (at 27–8 degrees north) has this hardiness zone.

==Economy==
Over the centuries the island has changed hands many times. Trading links with Northern Europe are reflected in Fair Isle Haa, a traditional Hanseatic trading booth located not far from the South Harbour, traditionally used by residents of the southern part of the island. Rent was usually paid to absentee landlords (who rarely visited) in butter, cloth and fish oil.

Fishing has always been an important industry for the island. In 1702, the Dutch, who were interested in Shetland&#x27;s herring fisheries, fought a naval battle against French warships just off the island.

Fair Isle is noted for its woollen jumpers, with knitting forming an important source of income for the women of the islands. The principal activity for the male islanders is crofting.

In January 2004, Fair Isle was granted Fairtrade Island status.

== Bird life ==
Many rare species of bird have been found on the island, with at least 27 species found on the island that were the first British records, and is probably the best place in western Europe to see skulking Siberian passerines such as Pechora pipit, lanceolated warbler and Pallas&#x27;s grasshopper warbler. For example, in 2015, rare birds discovered on the island included pallid harrier, arctic warbler, Moltoni&#x27;s warbler, booted warbler, paddyfield warbler, Siberian thrush, and thrush nightingale. It is also home to an endemic subspecies of Eurasian wren, the Fair Isle wren &quot;Troglodytes troglodytes fridariensis&quot;. Fair Isle has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports large colonies of seabirds and waterbirds, as well as being a stop-over site for migrating land birds.

=== Bird observatory ===
In 1948, George Waterston founded a permanent bird observatory on the island. Because of its importance as a bird migration watchpoint, it provided most of the accommodation on the island. The first director of the observatory was Kenneth Williamson. It was unusual among bird observatories in providing catered, rather than hostel-style, accommodation.

In 2010, a new observatory was built: a wooden lodge of two storeys, which cost £4 million and accommodated around 30 guests. The 2010 observatory building was destroyed by fire on 10 March 2019; the observatory&#x27;s records had been digitised and were not affected. The cost of rebuilding was estimated at £7.4m.

==Infrastructure==

Other than the restaurant of the bird observatory, and its small evening-only bar, there are no pubs or restaurants on the island. There is one shop, one school and a community hall used for meetings and social events. There is no police station on the island; the main station is Lerwick and a section station is located in the village of Brae.

Passenger service to the island is provided by SIC Ferries on the vessel &quot;Good Shepherd IV&quot; or by a nine-seat passenger aeroplane from Tingwall Airport near Lerwick, operated by regional carrier Directflight.

===Electricity supply===
Fair Isle is not connected to the National Grid; electricity is provided by the Fair Isle Electricity Company. From the 1980s, power was generated by two diesel generators and two wind turbines. Diesel generators were automatically switched off if wind turbines provided sufficient power. Excess capacity was distributed through a separate network for home heating, with remote frequency-sensitive programmable relays controlling water heaters and storage heaters in the buildings of the community. Following the installation of three wind turbines, combined with solar panels and batteries, in a £3.5 million scheme completed in October 2018, the island has had a 24-hour electricity supply.

===Communication===
Fair Isle is home to two GSM 900 MHz base stations operated by Vodafone and O2. On 16 April 2019, an EE 4G antenna was turned on by Openreach. In 2023, the island became connected by a fibre submarine cable, as a spur off a cable linking Shetland and Orkney. This supplements and upgrades the long-distance microwave link opened in 1979. Full fibre services then became available to all properties on the island.

===Emergency services===
Fair Isle has a fire station equipped with a single fire appliance, and staffed by a retained fire crew of local volunteers. It was originally part of the Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service, which was absorbed into the national Scottish Fire and Rescue Service on 1 April 2013. A locally organised volunteer fire brigade was formed in 1996 by island residents. This was later absorbed into the statutory fire service, with professional training provided, and the local service designated a retained fire crew. The first purpose-built fire engine was stationed to the island in 2002.

In October 2011, a contract for the construction of a £140,000 purpose-built fire station was awarded to Shetland company Ness Engineering, who completed the construction and equipping of the fire station, including its connection to the island power and water supplies, and the installation of a rainwater harvesting system within the building. The new fire station was officially opened on 14 March 2013.

There is a small Coastguard cliff-rescue team on the island. Like the fire service, the Coastguard is a retained (volunteer) emergency service. The Fair Isle Coastguard cliff rescue team were the first British Coastguard unit to be equipped with a quad ATV. The quad is painted in HM Coastguard livery, with reflective Battenburg markings and has an optional equipment trailer.

There are no emergency medical services on Fair Isle. Routine medical care is provided by a community nurse. In the event of accident and emergency the community nurse provides first aid until casualties can be removed to Shetland Mainland, usually by helicopter air ambulance. In severe weather conditions or life-threatening emergencies, the Coastguard helicopter can undertake the patient evacuation.

==Transport==

===Air===

Fair Isle Airport serves the island with flights to Tingwall Airport near Lerwick, and weekly to Sumburgh Airport, both on Shetland Mainland. Flights to Kirkwall on Orkney were scheduled to begin in September 2017, provided by Loganair. Private aircraft use the facility and scheduled flights arrive twice daily, three days a week. There is a small terminal building providing limited services. Fire cover is provided by the island fire service.

There are two helipads on the island; one at the South Fair Isle lighthouse and used by Northern Lighthouse Board and HM Coastguard helicopters, and the other at the North Fair Isle lighthouse.

===Sea===
There are two main harbours, north harbour and south harbour; both formed naturally, being sheltered by the headland of Bu Ness. They are separated by a narrow isthmus of gravel. The north harbour is the main route for goods, provisions, and Royal Mail postal services arriving at and departing from the island. The ferry &quot;Good Shepherd IV&quot; plies between Fair Isle north harbour and Grutness on Shetland Mainland. In summer only, the ferry also runs from Lerwick once every two weeks.

===Road===
A road connects the populated areas of the island, along its full length.

==Education==
Fair Isle has one primary school, with two classrooms. There is a full-time head teacher, and a part-time assistant teacher. The number of pupils varies over time, but has generally been between five and ten, with three pupils as of 2021. Islanders of secondary school age are generally educated off-island, on Shetland Mainland, where they board in halls of residence, returning to Fair Isle during holiday periods.

==Religion==
Christianity is the only formally organised religion on Fair Isle. There are two churches, one Methodist, and one Church of Scotland (Presbyterian). The Methodist Church has a resident non-stipendiary minister, who reports to a full-time minister on Shetland Mainland. The Methodist Church was constructed in 1886.

The Church of Scotland church was built in 1892. The Church of Scotland parish which contains Fair Isle is Dunrossness, which is linked with Sandwick, Cunningsburgh and Quarff parishes. The congregation&#x27;s minister is Reverend Charles H. Greig.

==Conservation designations==
Most of the island is designated by NatureScot as both a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation (SCA). The island and its surrounding seas are also designated by NatureScot as a Special Protection Area (SPA) due to the important bird species present.

In 2016 the seas around Fair Isle were designated as a Marine Protected Area (MPA). As of 2019 it is the only MPA in Scotland to be designated specifically as a &quot;Demonstration and Research&quot; MPA. The aims of this MPA designation are defined as being:

<text>Four Feather Falls is a British children&#x27;s western television series, the third puppet TV show produced by AP Films (APF) in association with Granada Television. It was based on an idea by Barry Gray, who also wrote the show&#x27;s music. The series was the first to use an early version of APF&#x27;s Supermarionation puppetry. Thirty-nine 13-minute episodes were produced between April 1959 and April 1960, and the series was first broadcast on the ITV network from February to November 1960.

The setting is the late 19th-century fictional Kansas town of Four Feather Falls, where the hero of the series, Tex Tucker, is a sheriff. The four feathers of the title refers to four magical feathers given to Tex by the Indian chief Kalamakooya as a reward for saving his grandson. One of the feathers allowed Tex&#x27;s guns to swivel and fire without being touched whenever he was in danger, two conferred the power of speech on Tex&#x27;s horse and dog, and the fourth feather could summon Kalamakooya.

Tex&#x27;s speaking voice was provided by Nicholas Parsons, and his singing voice by Michael Holliday. The series was sporadically repeated on British television until 1968, and was released on DVD in 2005.

==Plot==
The series is set in the fictitious late 19th-century Western town of Four Feather Falls, Kansas, and features the adventures of its sheriff, Tex Tucker.

In the first episode, Grandpa Twink relates the story of how it all began to his grandson, Little Jake. Tex is riding up from the valley and comes across a lost and hungry Indian boy, Makooya, and saves him. Tex is given four magic feathers by the boy&#x27;s grandfather, Chief Kalamakooya, as a reward for saving his grandson. Two of the feathers allow his guns to swivel and fire automatically (often while Tex&#x27;s hands are raised), and the other two allow his horse, Rocky, and his dog, Dusty, to speak. As Tex, his horse, and dog are very thirsty, Kalamakooya also makes a waterfall where there had been no water before, and so when the town was built it was named after Tex&#x27;s feathers and the waterfall.

The characters of the town are Grandpa Twink, who does little but rest in a chair; his grandson Little Jake, the only child in town; Ma Jones, who runs the town store; Doc Haggerty; Slim Jim, the bartender of the Denison saloon; Marvin Jackson, the bank manager; and Dan Morse, the telegraphist. Other characters appeared from time to time for only one episode, often just visiting town.

The villains included Pedro, who was introduced in the first show and Fernando, who first appeared in the second episode as a sidekick and someone Pedro could blame when things went wrong, as they always did. Big Ben was another villain who appeared from time to time, as did Red Scalp, a renegade Indian. Other villains only appeared in single episodes.

Denise Bryer had worked with Anderson on &quot;The Adventures of Twizzle&quot;, and he wanted her to play some of the voices in &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot;. Anderson visited Bryer at her home with some scripts and asked her husband, Nicholas Parsons, to help by reading some of the other parts, including the sheriff Tex Tucker. Anderson liked Parsons&#x27; interpretation and offered him the job of providing Tex&#x27;s speaking voice.

==Episodes==
==Production==
American Western TV shows such as &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and &quot;Wagon Train&quot; were popular with British audiences, so APF&#x27;s Gerry Anderson and Arthur Provis decided to make a cowboy series based on a story concept pitched to them by Barry Gray. According to Anderson, &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot; &quot;was really me trying to make the sort of films I used to see in the cinema.&quot; APF offered Gray about £100 (£ in ) to buy his idea, which was originally titled &quot;Two Gun Tex Tucker&quot;. This was changed to &quot;Two Gun Tex of Texas&quot;, then &quot;The Sheriff of Four Feather Falls&quot; before the final title was chosen. 

Development began in late 1958 while the first 26 episodes of &quot;Torchy the Battery Boy&quot; were still in production, and without the knowledge of APF&#x27;s employer Roberta Leigh, with whom Anderson planned to sever ties in the aim of becoming an independent producer. The pilot episode, &quot;How It Began&quot;, was produced in April 1959 on a budget of £6,000 (about £ in ). A full series of 39 episodes was commissioned by Granada after APF&#x27;s intended distributor, Anglo Amalgamated, turned it down. Except for the pilot, which was made in APF&#x27;s studios at Islet Park House in Maidenhead, all episodes were made in a converted warehouse on the Slough Trading Estate. Previously owned by special effects artist Les Bowie, this provided quadruple the floor space of Islet Park House, where the crew had been filming in a re-purposed ballroom. After moving to the Slough estate in June 1959, APF upgraded its new facilities with the installation of a director&#x27;s control booth and video assist TV monitors to guide the puppeteers, who operated the marionettes from a Dexion bridge built several feet over the set. The model set representing the town of Four Feather Falls measured . Filming in Slough ended in April 1960. 

Anderson considered the puppets with static heads, made by Christine Glanville for his earlier productions, to be unacceptable because the viewer could not tell which character was talking unless its puppet moved up or down. For &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot;, the papier-mâché heads were replaced by interchangeable hollow fibreglass heads with internal rods that could move the eyes from side to side. The heads also contained sound-activated solenoids, which allowed the puppets&#x27; lips to move automatically in synchronisation with the dialogue. The electronics of the day required more space than would be available in a human-scale head, therefore all the puppets in &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot; had oversized heads, though the bodies as a whole were one-third life size. Anderson&#x27;s aim was to make the puppets look as realistic as possible, the beginning of the Supermarionation puppetry process, although that term was not coined until his next series, &quot;Supercar&quot;.

The wires used to control the puppets were eight feet long and made of tungsten steel, an improvement on the curtain wire used in Anderson&#x27;s two earlier puppet series (&quot;The Adventures of Twizzle&quot; and &quot;Torchy&quot;), and were only 1/200 of an inch thick. Being shiny, the wires had to be blackened. The horses moved by being pulled along on a trolley, which meant the viewer never saw their feet when they were moving.

The voice cast assembled to record each script without seeing the puppets, much like recording a radio series; synchronisation of each character&#x27;s speech with the movement of its puppet&#x27;s mouth was performed later. The tight budget precluded the use of sophisticated special effects, and less costly alternatives were used. For example, to achieve the effect of muzzle flashes, small specks of black paint were carefully applied to the 35 mm negatives so they would appear as white flashes on the finished prints. The production design and puppet costuming were more detailed than those of &quot;Twizzle&quot; and &quot;Torchy&quot;.

Continuity for the series was provided by Sylvia Thamm, who later married Gerry Anderson. Provis, who left APF mid-production due to disagreements over the direction of the company, was given a five per cent share of the profits from the series.

==Music==
The show&#x27;s music and song lyrics were composed by Barry Gray. Michael Holliday provided Tex&#x27;s singing voice, and Tommy Reilly performed the harmonica pieces. The best known song to come out of the series was &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot;, sung in some episodes by Michael Holliday in the style of Bing Crosby and sometimes incorrectly described as the theme song to the series. The closing theme song was &quot;Two Gun Tex of Texas.&quot; Holliday was paid £2,000 (about £ in ) for his singing work on the pilot episodea significant part of the pilot&#x27;s £6,000 budget. In all, Holliday recorded six songs for the series: &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot;, &quot;The Phantom Rider&quot;, &quot;The Rick-Rick-A-Rackety Train&quot;, &quot;Happy Hearts and Friendly Faces&quot;, &quot;My Home Town&quot;, and &quot;Two Gun Tex of Texas&quot;. The recording was conducted at Gate Studios in Borehamwood.

==Syndication==
&quot;Four Feather Falls&quot; was the first APF series to be fully networked on ITV, that is shown by all regional franchises of the network simultaneously. The series was repeated in some British TV regions on a sporadic basis up until 1968. In December 2004, it was announced that the rights had been acquired by Network, and it was released on three Region 2 DVDs in May 2005. It is the only Supermarionation series not yet released to DVD in North America as of January 2006. Sylvia Anderson wrote two British children&#x27;s annuals based on the show, published by Collins in 1960 and 1961. The first book featured a short text story based on the pilot episode of the TV series.

==Other media==
The show was adapted into comics form and published as an ongoing strip in Polystyle Publications&#x27; &quot;TV Comic&quot;. The &quot;Four Feathers Falls&quot; strip was drawn by Neville Main, and appeared from issue #439 (14 May 1960) until issue #564 (6 October 1962). Sylvia Anderson wrote a &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot; annual. A tie-in board game was also released.

<text>Fly-by-wire (FBW) is a system that replaces the conventional manual flight controls of an aircraft with an electronic interface. The movements of flight controls are converted to electronic signals, and flight control computers determine how to move the actuators at each control surface to provide the ordered response. Implementations either use mechanical flight control backup systems or else are fully electronic.

Improved fully fly-by-wire systems interpret the pilot&#x27;s control inputs as a desired outcome and calculate the control surface positions required to achieve that outcome; this results in various combinations of rudder, elevator, aileron, flaps and engine controls in different situations using a closed feedback loop. The pilot may not be fully aware of all the control outputs acting to affect the outcome, only that the aircraft is reacting as expected. The fly-by-wire computers act to stabilize the aircraft and adjust the flying characteristics without the pilot&#x27;s involvement, and to prevent the pilot from operating outside of the aircraft&#x27;s safe performance envelope.

== Rationale ==

Mechanical and hydro-mechanical flight control systems are relatively heavy and require careful routing of flight control cables through the aircraft by systems of pulleys, cranks, tension cables and hydraulic pipes. Both systems often require redundant backup to deal with failures, which increases weight. Both have limited ability to compensate for changing aerodynamic conditions. Dangerous characteristics such as stalling, spinning and pilot-induced oscillation (PIO), which depend mainly on the stability and structure of the aircraft rather than the control system itself, are dependent on the pilot&#x27;s actions.

The term &quot;fly-by-wire&quot; implies a purely electrically signaled control system. It is used in the general sense of computer-configured controls, where a computer system is interposed between the operator and the final control actuators or surfaces. This modifies the manual inputs of the pilot in accordance with control parameters.

Side-sticks or conventional flight control yokes can be used to fly fly-by-wire aircraft.

=== Weight saving ===
A fly-by-wire aircraft can be lighter than a similar design with conventional controls. This is partly due to the lower overall weight of the system components and partly because the natural stability of the aircraft can be relaxed (slightly for a transport aircraft; more for a maneuverable fighter), which means that the stability surfaces that are part of the aircraft structure can therefore be made smaller. These include the vertical and horizontal stabilizers (fin and tailplane) that are (normally) at the rear of the fuselage. If these structures can be reduced in size, airframe weight is reduced. The advantages of fly-by-wire controls were first exploited by the military and then in the commercial airline market. The Airbus series of airliners used full-authority fly-by-wire controls beginning with their A320 series, see A320 flight control (though some limited fly-by-wire functions existed on A310 aircraft). Boeing followed with their 777 and later designs.

== Basic operation ==

=== Closed-loop feedback control ===

A pilot commands the flight control computer to make the aircraft perform a certain action, such as pitch the aircraft up, or roll to one side, by moving the control column or sidestick. The flight control computer then calculates what control surface movements will cause the plane to perform that action and issues those commands to the electronic controllers for each surface. The controllers at each surface receive these commands and then move actuators attached to the control surface until it has moved to where the flight control computer commanded it to. The controllers measure the position of the flight control surface with sensors such as LVDTs.

=== Automatic stability systems ===

Fly-by-wire control systems allow aircraft computers to perform tasks without pilot input. Automatic stability systems operate in this way. Gyroscopes and sensors such as accelerometers are mounted in an aircraft to sense rotation on the pitch, roll and yaw axes. Any movement (from straight and level flight for example) results in signals to the computer, which can automatically move control actuators to stabilize the aircraft.

== Safety and redundancy ==

While traditional mechanical or hydraulic control systems usually fail gradually, the loss of all flight control computers immediately renders the aircraft uncontrollable. For this reason, most fly-by-wire systems incorporate either redundant computers (triplex, quadruplex etc.), some kind of mechanical or hydraulic backup or a combination of both. A &quot;mixed&quot; control system with mechanical backup feedbacks any rudder elevation directly to the pilot and therefore makes closed loop (feedback) systems senseless.

Aircraft systems may be quadruplexed (four independent channels) to prevent loss of signals in the case of failure of one or even two channels. High performance aircraft that have fly-by-wire controls (also called CCVs or Control-Configured Vehicles) may be deliberately designed to have low or even negative stability in some flight regimes rapid-reacting CCV controls can electronically stabilize the lack of natural stability.

Pre-flight safety checks of a fly-by-wire system are often performed using built-in test equipment (BITE). A number of control movement steps can be automatically performed, reducing workload of the pilot or groundcrew and speeding up flight-checks.

Some aircraft, the Panavia Tornado for example, retain a very basic hydro-mechanical backup system for limited flight control capability on losing electrical power; in the case of the Tornado this allows rudimentary control of the stabilators only for pitch and roll axis movements.

== History ==

Servo-electrically operated control surfaces were first tested in the 1930s on the Soviet Tupolev ANT-20. Long runs of mechanical and hydraulic connections were replaced with wires and electric servos.

In 1934, filed a patent about the automatic-electronic system, which flared the aircraft, when it was close to the ground. In 1941, while being an engineer at Siemens, developed and tested the first fly-by-wire system for the Heinkel He 111, in which the aircraft was fully controlled by electronic impulses.

The first non-experimental aircraft that was designed and flown (in 1958) with a fly-by-wire flight control system was the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow, a feat not repeated with a production aircraft (though the Arrow was cancelled with five built) until Concorde in 1969, which became the first fly-by-wire airliner. This system also included solid-state components and system redundancy, was designed to be integrated with a computerised navigation and automatic search and track radar, was flyable from ground control with data uplink and downlink, and provided artificial feel (feedback) to the pilot.

The first electronic fly-by-wire testbed operated by the U.S. Air Force was a Boeing B-47E Stratojet (Ser. No. 53-2280)

The first pure electronic fly-by-wire aircraft with no mechanical or hydraulic backup was the Apollo Lunar Landing Training Vehicle (LLTV), first flown in 1968. This was preceded in 1964 by the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle (LLRV) which pioneered fly-by-wire flight with no mechanical backup. Control was through a digital computer with three analog redundant channels. In the USSR, the Sukhoi T-4 also flew. At about the same time in the United Kingdom a trainer variant of the British Hawker Hunter fighter was modified at the British Royal Aircraft Establishment with fly-by-wire flight controls for the right-seat pilot.

In the UK the two seater Avro 707C was flown with a Fairey system with mechanical backup in the early to mid-60s. The program was curtailed when the air-frame ran out of flight time.

In 1972, the first digital fly-by-wire fixed-wing aircraft without a mechanical backup to take to the air was an F-8 Crusader, which had been modified electronically by NASA of the United States as a test aircraft; the F-8 used the Apollo guidance, navigation and control hardware.

The Airbus A320 began service in 1988 as the first mass-produced airliner with digital fly-by-wire controls. As of June 2024, over 11,000 A320 family aircraft, variants included, are operational around the world, making it one of the best-selling commercial jets.

Boeing chose fly-by-wire flight controls for the 777 in 1994, departing from traditional cable and pulley systems. In addition to overseeing the aircraft&#x27;s flight control, the FBW offered &quot;envelope protection&quot;, which guaranteed that the system would step in to avoid accidental mishandling, stalls, or excessive structural stress on the aircraft. The 777 used ARINC 629 buses to connect primary flight computers (PFCs) with actuator-control electronics units (ACEs). Every PFC housed three 32-bit microprocessors, including a Motorola 68040, an Intel 80486, and an AMD 29050, all programmed in Ada programming language.

== Analog systems ==
All fly-by-wire flight control systems eliminate the complexity, fragility and weight of the mechanical circuit of the hydromechanical or electromechanical flight control systems – each being replaced with electronic circuits. The control mechanisms in the cockpit now operate signal transducers, which in turn generate the appropriate commands. These are next processed by an electronic controller—either an analog one, or (more modernly) a digital one. Aircraft and spacecraft autopilots are now part of the electronic controller.

The hydraulic circuits are similar except that mechanical servo valves are replaced with electrically controlled servo valves, operated by the electronic controller. This is the simplest and earliest configuration of an analog fly-by-wire flight control system. In this configuration, the flight control systems must simulate &quot;feel&quot;. The electronic controller controls electrical devices that provide the appropriate &quot;feel&quot; forces on the manual controls. This was used in Concorde, the first production fly-by-wire airliner.

== Digital systems ==
A digital fly-by-wire flight control system can be extended from its analog counterpart. Digital signal processing can receive and interpret input from multiple sensors simultaneously (such as the altimeters and the pitot tubes) and adjust the controls in real time. The computers sense position and force inputs from pilot controls and aircraft sensors. They then solve differential equations related to the aircraft&#x27;s equations of motion to determine the appropriate command signals for the flight controls to execute the intentions of the pilot.

The programming of the digital computers enable flight envelope protection. These protections are tailored to an aircraft&#x27;s handling characteristics to stay within aerodynamic and structural limitations of the aircraft. For example, the computer in flight envelope protection mode can try to prevent the aircraft from being handled dangerously by preventing pilots from exceeding preset limits on the aircraft&#x27;s flight-control envelope, such as those that prevent stalls and spins, and which limit airspeeds and g forces on the airplane. Software can also be included that stabilize the flight-control inputs to avoid pilot-induced oscillations.

Since the flight-control computers continuously feedback the environment, pilot&#x27;s workloads can be reduced. This also enables military aircraft with relaxed stability. The primary benefit for such aircraft is more maneuverability during combat and training flights, and the so-called &quot;carefree handling&quot; because stalling, spinning and other undesirable performances are prevented automatically by the computers. Digital flight control systems (DFCS) enable inherently unstable combat aircraft, such as the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk and the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit flying wing to fly in usable and safe manners.

=== Legislation ===
The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has adopted the RTCA/DO-178C, titled &quot;Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification&quot;, as the certification standard for aviation software. Any safety-critical component in a digital fly-by-wire system including applications of the laws of aeronautics and computer operating systems will need to be certified to DO-178C Level A or B, depending on the class of aircraft, which is applicable for preventing potential catastrophic failures.

Nevertheless, the top concern for computerized, digital, fly-by-wire systems is reliability, even more so than for analog electronic control systems. This is because the digital computers that are running software are often the only control path between the pilot and aircraft&#x27;s flight control surfaces. If the computer software crashes for any reason, the pilot may be unable to control an aircraft. Hence virtually all fly-by-wire flight control systems are either triply or quadruply redundant in their computers and electronics. These have three or four flight-control computers operating in parallel and three or four separate data buses connecting them with each control surface.

=== Redundancy ===
The multiple redundant flight control computers continuously monitor each other&#x27;s output. If one computer begins to give aberrant results for any reason, potentially including software or hardware failures or flawed input data, then the combined system is designed to exclude the results from that computer in deciding the appropriate actions for the flight controls. Depending on specific system details there may be the potential to reboot an aberrant flight control computer, or to reincorporate its inputs if they return to agreement. Complex logic exists to deal with multiple failures, which may prompt the system to revert to simpler back-up modes.

In addition, most of the early digital fly-by-wire aircraft also had an analog electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic back-up flight control system. The Space Shuttle had, in addition to its redundant set of four digital computers running its primary flight-control software, a fifth backup computer running a separately developed, reduced-function, software flight-control system – one that could be commanded to take over in the event that a fault ever affected all of the other four computers. This backup system served to reduce the risk of total flight control system failure ever happening because of a general-purpose flight software fault that had escaped notice in the other four computers.

=== Efficiency of flight ===
For airliners, flight-control redundancy improves their safety, but fly-by-wire control systems, which are physically lighter and have lower maintenance demands than conventional controls also improve economy, both in terms of cost of ownership and for in-flight economy. In certain designs with limited relaxed stability in the pitch axis, for example the Boeing 777, the flight control system may allow the aircraft to fly at a more aerodynamically efficient angle of attack than a conventionally stable design. Modern airliners also commonly feature computerized Full-Authority Digital Engine Control systems (FADECs) that control their engines, air inlets, fuel storage and distribution system, in a similar fashion to the way that FBW controls the flight control surfaces. This allows the engine output to be continually varied for the most efficient usage possible.

The second generation Embraer E-Jet family gained a 1.5% efficiency improvement over the first generation from the fly-by-wire system, which enabled a reduction from 280 ft.² to 250 ft.² for the horizontal stabilizer on the E190/195 variants.

=== Airbus/Boeing ===
Airbus and Boeing differ in their approaches to implementing fly-by-wire systems in commercial aircraft. Since the Airbus A320, Airbus flight-envelope control systems always retain ultimate flight control when flying under normal law and will not permit pilots to violate aircraft performance limits unless they choose to fly under alternate law. This strategy has been continued on subsequent Airbus airliners. However, in the event of multiple failures of redundant computers, the A320 does have a mechanical back-up system for its pitch trim and its rudder, the Airbus A340 has a purely electrical (not electronic) back-up rudder control system and beginning with the A380, all flight-control systems have back-up systems that are purely electrical through the use of a &quot;three-axis Backup Control Module&quot; (BCM).

Boeing airliners, such as the Boeing 777, allow the pilots to completely override the computerized flight control system, permitting the aircraft to be flown outside of its usual flight control envelope.

=== Applications ===

* Concorde was the first production fly-by-wire aircraft with analog control.
* The General Dynamics F-16 was the first production aircraft to use digital fly-by-wire controls.
* The Space Shuttle orbiter had an all-digital fly-by-wire control system. This system was first exercised (as the only flight control system) during the glider unpowered-flight &quot;Approach and Landing Tests&quot; that began with the Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot; during 1977.
* Launched into production during 1984, the Airbus Industries Airbus A320 became the first airliner to fly with an all-digital fly-by-wire control system.
* With its launch in 1993 the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III became the first fly-by-wire military transport aircraft.
* In 2005, the Dassault Falcon 7X became the first business jet with fly-by-wire controls.
* A fully digital fly-by-wire without a closed feedback loop was integrated in 2002 in the first generation Embraer E-Jet family. By closing the loop (feedback), the second generation Embraer E-Jet family gained a 1.5% efficiency improvement in 2016.

== Engine digital control ==
The advent of FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) engines permits operation of the flight control systems and autothrottles for the engines to be fully integrated. On modern military aircraft other systems such as autostabilization, navigation, radar and weapons system are all integrated with the flight control systems. FADEC allows maximum performance to be extracted from the aircraft without fear of engine misoperation, aircraft damage or high pilot workloads.

In the civil field, the integration increases flight safety and economy. Airbus fly-by-wire aircraft are protected from dangerous situations such as low-speed stall or overstressing by flight envelope protection. As a result, in such conditions, the flight control systems commands the engines to increase thrust without pilot intervention. In economy cruise modes, the flight control systems adjust the throttles and fuel tank selections precisely. FADEC reduces rudder drag needed to compensate for sideways flight from unbalanced engine thrust. On the A330/A340 family, fuel is transferred between the main (wing and center fuselage) tanks and a fuel tank in the horizontal stabilizer, to optimize the aircraft&#x27;s center of gravity during cruise flight. The fuel management controls keep the aircraft&#x27;s center of gravity accurately trimmed with fuel weight, rather than drag-inducing aerodynamic trims in the elevators.

== Further developments ==

===Fly-by-optics===

Fly-by-optics is sometimes used instead of fly-by-wire because it offers a higher data transfer rate, immunity to electromagnetic interference and lighter weight. In most cases, the cables are just changed from electrical to optical fiber cables. Sometimes it is referred to as &quot;fly-by-light&quot; due to its use of fiber optics. The data generated by the software and interpreted by the controller remain the same. Fly-by-light has the effect of decreasing electro-magnetic disturbances to sensors in comparison to more common fly-by-wire control systems. The Kawasaki P-1 is the first production aircraft in the world to be equipped with such a flight control system.

=== Power-by-wire ===

Having eliminated the mechanical transmission circuits in fly-by-wire flight control systems, the next step is to eliminate the bulky and heavy hydraulic circuits. The hydraulic circuit is replaced by an electrical power circuit. The power circuits power electrical or self-contained electrohydraulic actuators that are controlled by the digital flight control computers. All benefits of digital fly-by-wire are retained since the power-by-wire components are strictly complementary to the fly-by-wire components.

The biggest benefits are weight savings, the possibility of redundant power circuits and tighter integration between the aircraft flight control systems and its avionics systems. The absence of hydraulics greatly reduces maintenance costs. This system is used in the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II and in Airbus A380 backup flight controls. The Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 also incorporate electrically powered backup flight controls which remain operational even in the event of a total loss of hydraulic power.

=== Fly-by-wireless ===

Wiring adds a considerable amount of weight to an aircraft; therefore, researchers are exploring implementing fly-by-wireless solutions. Fly-by-wireless systems are very similar to fly-by-wire systems, however, instead of using a wired protocol for the physical layer a wireless protocol is employed.

In addition to reducing weight, implementing a wireless solution has the potential to reduce costs throughout an aircraft&#x27;s life cycle. For example, many key failure points associated with wire and connectors will be eliminated thus hours spent troubleshooting wires and connectors will be reduced. Furthermore, engineering costs could potentially decrease because less time would be spent on designing wiring installations, late changes in an aircraft&#x27;s design would be easier to manage, etc.

=== Intelligent flight control system ===

A newer flight control system, called intelligent flight control system (IFCS), is an extension of modern digital fly-by-wire flight control systems. The aim is to intelligently compensate for aircraft damage and failure during flight, such as automatically using engine thrust and other avionics to compensate for severe failures such as loss of hydraulics, loss of rudder, loss of ailerons, loss of an engine, etc. Several demonstrations were made on a flight simulator where a Cessna-trained small-aircraft pilot successfully landed a heavily damaged full-size concept jet, without prior experience with large-body jet aircraft. This development is being spearheaded by NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. It is reported that enhancements are mostly software upgrades to existing fully computerized digital fly-by-wire flight control systems. The Dassault Falcon 7X and Embraer Legacy 500 business jets have flight computers that can partially compensate for engine-out scenarios by adjusting thrust levels and control inputs, but still require pilots to respond appropriately.

<doc id="11523" wikidata="Q48249" url="?curid=11523" title="Falklands War">
<text>The Falklands War () was a ten-week undeclared war between Argentina and the United Kingdom in 1982 over two British dependent territories in the South Atlantic: the Falkland Islands and its territorial dependency, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The conflict began on 2 April 1982, when Argentina invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands, followed by the invasion of South Georgia the next day. On 5 April, the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on the islands. The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with an Argentine surrender on 14 June, returning the islands to British control. In total, 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders were killed during the hostilities.

The conflict was a major episode in the protracted dispute over the territories&#x27; sovereignty. Argentina asserted (and maintains) that the islands are Argentine territory, and the Argentine government thus described its military action as the reclamation of its own territory. The British government regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a Crown colony since 1841. Falkland Islanders, who have inhabited the islands since the early 19th century, are predominantly descendants of British settlers, and strongly favour British sovereignty. Neither state officially declared war, although both governments declared the islands a war zone.

The conflict had a strong effect in both countries and has been the subject of various books, articles, films, and songs. Patriotic sentiment ran high in Argentina, but the unfavourable outcome prompted large protests against the ruling military government, hastening its downfall and the democratisation of the country. In the United Kingdom, the Conservative government, bolstered by the successful outcome, was re-elected with an increased majority the following year. The cultural and political effect of the conflict has been less in the UK than in Argentina, where it has remained a common topic for discussion.

Diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina were restored in 1989 following a meeting in Madrid, at which the two governments issued a joint statement. No change in either country&#x27;s position regarding the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands was made explicit. In 1994, Argentina adopted a new constitution, which declared the Falkland Islands as part of one of its provinces by law. However, the islands continue to operate as a self-governing British Overseas Territory.

== Prelude ==
===Failed diplomacy===
In 1965, the United Nations called upon Argentina and the United Kingdom to reach a settlement of the sovereignty dispute. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) regarded the islands as a nuisance and barrier to UK trade in South America. Therefore, while confident of British sovereignty, the FCO was prepared to cede the islands to Argentina. When news of a proposed transfer broke in 1968, elements sympathetic with the plight of the islanders were able to organise an effective parliamentary lobby to frustrate the FCO plans. Negotiations continued, but in general failed to make meaningful progress; the islanders steadfastly refused to consider Argentine sovereignty on one side, whilst Argentina would not compromise over sovereignty on the other. The FCO then sought to make the islands dependent on Argentina, hoping this would make the islanders more amenable to Argentine sovereignty. A Communications Agreement signed in 1971 created an airlink and later YPF, the Argentine oil company, was given a monopoly in the islands.

In 1977, the British prime minister, James Callaghan, in response to heightened tensions in the region and the Argentine occupation of Southern Thule, secretly sent a force of two frigates and a nuclear-powered submarine, , to the South Atlantic, codenamed Operation Journeyman. It is unclear whether the Argentines were aware of their presence, but British sources state that they were advised of it through informal channels. Nevertheless, talks with Argentina on Falklands sovereignty and economic cooperation opened in December of that year, though they proved inconclusive.

In 1980, a new UK Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Nicholas Ridley, went to the Falklands trying to sell the islanders the benefits of a leaseback scheme, which met with strong opposition from the islanders. On his return to London in December 1980, he reported to parliament but was viciously attacked as what was seen as a sellout. (It was unlikely that leaseback idea would have progressed further anyway since the British had sought a long-term lease of 99 years, whereas Argentina was pressing for a much shorter period of only thirty years.) At a private committee meeting that evening, it was reported that Ridley said: &quot;If we don&#x27;t do something, they will invade. And there is nothing we could do.&quot;

===The Argentine junta===
In the period leading up to the war—and, in particular, following the transfer of power between the military dictators General Jorge Rafael Videla and General Roberto Eduardo Viola late in March 1981—Argentina had been in the midst of devastating economic stagnation and large-scale civil unrest against the National Reorganisation Process, the military &quot;junta&quot; that had been governing the country since 1976.

In December 1981, there was a further change in the Argentine military regime, bringing to office a new &quot;junta&quot; headed by General Leopoldo Galtieri (acting president), Air Brigadier Basilio Lami Dozo and Admiral Jorge Anaya. Anaya was the main architect and supporter of a military solution for the long-standing claim over the islands, expecting that the United Kingdom would never respond militarily.

By opting for military action, the Galtieri government hoped to mobilise the long-standing patriotic feelings of Argentines towards the islands, diverting public attention from the chronic economic problems and the ongoing human rights violations of its Dirty War, bolstering the junta&#x27;s dwindling legitimacy. The newspaper &quot;La Prensa&quot; speculated on a step-by-step plan beginning with cutting off supplies to the islands, ending in direct actions late in 1982, if the UN talks were fruitless.

The ongoing tension between the two countries over the islands increased on 19 March, when a group of Argentine scrap metal merchants (which had been infiltrated by Argentine Marines) raised the Argentine flag at South Georgia Island, an act that would later be seen as the first offensive action in the war. The Royal Navy ice patrol vessel was dispatched from Stanley to South Georgia on the 25th in response. The Argentine military junta, suspecting that the UK would reinforce its South Atlantic Forces, ordered the invasion of the Falkland Islands to be brought forward to 2 April.

The UK was initially taken by surprise by the Argentine attack on the South Atlantic islands, despite repeated warnings by Royal Navy captain Nicholas Barker (Commanding Officer of the &quot;Endurance&quot;) and others. Barker believed that Defence Secretary John Nott&#x27;s 1981 Defence White Paper (in which Nott described plans to withdraw the &quot;Endurance&quot;, the UK&#x27;s only naval presence in the South Atlantic) had sent a signal to the Argentines that the UK was unwilling, and would soon be unable, to defend its territories and subjects in the Falklands.

== Argentine invasion ==
On 2 April 1982, Argentine forces mounted amphibious landings, known as Operation Rosario, on the Falkland Islands. The invasion was met with a fierce but brief defence organised by the Falkland Islands&#x27; Governor Sir Rex Hunt, giving command to Major Mike Norman of the Royal Marines. The garrison consisted of 68 marines and eleven naval hydrographers, assisted by 23 volunteers of the Falkland Islands Defence Force (FIDF), who had few weapons and were used as lookouts. The invasion started with the landing of Lieutenant Commander Guillermo Sanchez-Sabarots&#x27; Amphibious Commandos Group, who attacked the empty Moody Brook barracks and then moved on Government House in Stanley. When the 2nd Marine Infantry Battalion with Assault Amphibious Vehicles arrived, the governor ordered a ceasefire and surrendered. The governor, his family and the British military personnel were flown to Argentina that afternoon and later repatriated to the United Kingdom.

=== Initial British response ===

The British had already taken action prior to the 2 April invasion. In response to events on South Georgia, on 29 March, Ministers decided to send the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) &quot;Fort Austin&quot; south from the Mediterranean to support HMS &quot;Endurance&quot;, and the nuclear-powered fleet submarine from Gibraltar, with ordered south from Scotland the following day. Lord Carrington had wished to send a third submarine, but the decision was deferred due to concerns about the impact on operational commitments. Coincidentally, on 26 March, the submarine left Gibraltar and it was assumed in the press she was heading south. There has since been speculation that the effect of those reports was to panic the Argentine junta into invading the Falklands before submarines could be deployed; however, post-war research has established that the final decision to proceed was made at a junta meeting in Buenos Aires on 23 March.

The following day, during a crisis meeting headed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Sir Henry Leach, advised that &quot;Britain could and should send a task force if the islands are invaded&quot;. On 1 April, Leach sent orders to a Royal Navy force carrying out exercises in the Mediterranean to prepare to sail south. Following the invasion on 2 April, after an emergency meeting of the cabinet, approval was given to form a task force to retake the islands. This was backed in an emergency sitting of the House of Commons the next day.
Word of the invasion first reached the UK from Argentine sources. A Ministry of Defence operative in London had a short telex conversation with Governor Hunt&#x27;s telex operator, who confirmed that Argentines were on the island and in control. Later that day, BBC journalist Laurie Margolis spoke with an islander at Goose Green via amateur radio, who confirmed the presence of a large Argentine fleet and that Argentine forces had taken control of the island. British military operations in the Falklands War were given the codename &quot;Operation Corporate&quot;, and the commander of the task force was Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse. Operations lasted from 1 April 1982 to 20 June 1982.

On 6 April, the British Government set up a War Cabinet to provide day-to-day political oversight of the campaign. This was the critical instrument of crisis management for the British with its remit being to &quot;keep under review political and military developments relating to the South Atlantic, and to report as necessary to the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee&quot;. The War Cabinet met at least daily until it was dissolved on 12 August. Although Margaret Thatcher is described as dominating the War Cabinet, Lawrence Freedman notes in the &quot;Official History of the Falklands Campaign&quot; that she did not ignore opposition or fail to consult others. However, once a decision was reached, she &quot;did not look back&quot;.

===United Nations Security Council Resolution 502===
On 31 March 1982, the Argentine ambassador to the UN, Eduardo Roca, began attempting to garner support against a British military build-up designed to thwart earlier UN resolutions calling for both countries to resolve the Falklands dispute through discussion. On 2 April, the night of the invasion, a banquet was held at Roca&#x27;s official residence for the US ambassador to the UN, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and several high-ranking officials of the United States Department of State and the United States Department of Defense. This led British diplomats to view Kirkpatrick, who had earlier called for closer relationships with South American dictatorships, with considerable suspicion.

On 1 April, London told the UK ambassador to the UN, Sir Anthony Parsons, that an invasion was imminent and he should call an urgent meeting of the Security Council to get a favourable resolution against Argentina. Parsons had to get nine affirmative votes from the 15 Council members (not a simple majority) and to avoid a blocking vote from any of the other four permanent members. The meeting took place at 11:00am on 3 April, New York time (4:00pm in London). United Nations Security Council Resolution 502 was adopted by 10 to 1 (with Panama voting against) and 4 abstentions. Significantly, the Soviet Union and China both abstained. The resolution stated:
This was a significant win for the UK, giving it the upper hand diplomatically. The draft resolution Parsons submitted had avoided any reference to the sovereignty dispute (which might have worked against the UK): instead it focused on Argentina&#x27;s breach of Chapter VII of the UN Charter which forbids the threat or use of force to settle disputes. The resolution called for the removal only of Argentine forces: this freed Britain to retake the islands militarily, if Argentina did not leave, by exercising its right to self-defence allowed under the UN Charter.

===Argentine occupation===
The Argentine Army unit earmarked for the occupation was the 25th Infantry Regiment, a unit of about 681 men specially trained from all the regions of Argentina; it was flown into Port Stanley Airport as soon as the runway had been cleared. Once it became clear that the British were sending an amphibious task force, there was a general recall of reservists and two brigades of eight infantry regiments and their supporting units were dispatched to the islands. The total Argentine garrison numbered some 13,000 troops by the beginning of May. The conscripts born in 1963 had only recently been called-up, so they were supplemented by the recall of the previous year&#x27;s intake. Brigadier General Mario Benjamín Menéndez was appointed Military Governor of the Malvinas.

Argentine military police arrived with detailed files on many islanders, allowing intelligence officer Major Patricio Dowling to arrest and interrogate islanders who he suspected might lead opposition to the occupation. Initially, Islanders suspected of holding anti-Argentine views were expelled, including the Luxton family (who had lived in the islands since the 1840s) and David Colville, editor of the &quot;Falklands Times&quot;. This proved to be counter-productive, as those expelled gave interviews to the press. Subsequently, fourteen other community leaders, including the senior medical officer, were interned at Fox Bay on West Falkland. Concerned by Dowling&#x27;s actions, senior Argentine officers had him removed from the islands. For almost a month, the civilian population of Goose Green was detained in the village hall in &quot;unpleasant conditions&quot;. Less well known are similar detentions in other outlying settlements, including one islander who died after being denied access to his medication. As the war&#x27;s end approached, some troops began to place booby traps in civilian homes, defiled homes with excrement, destroyed civilian property and committed arson against civilian properties.

Argentine officers and NCOs have been accused of handing out rough Field punishment to their conscript soldiers. Ration packs from the Moody Brook depot were found to have foodstuff missing according to Private Alan Craig from the 7th Regiment, and troops garrisoning Port Howard were starved, and according to Max Hastings and Simon Jenkins in their book &quot;The Battle for the Falklands&quot; (Norton, 1984), &quot;Attempts to go absent without leave were punished by beatings or forcing the offender to sit for hours with his naked feet in the freezing water on the mountainside.&quot; Private Rito Portillo from the 1st Marine Anti-Aircraft Battalion and Private Remigio Fernández from the 5th Regiment were reported to have been executed or died because of mistreatment by their own officers. Soldiers were made to sign non-disclosure documents on their return from the Islands.

===Shuttle diplomacy===

On 8 April, Alexander Haig, the United States Secretary of State, arrived in London on a shuttle diplomacy mission from President Ronald Reagan to broker a peace deal based on an interim authority taking control of the islands pending negotiations. After hearing from Thatcher that the task force would not be withdrawn unless the Argentines evacuated their troops, Haig headed for Buenos Aires. There he met the junta and Nicanor Costa Méndez, the foreign minister. Haig was treated coolly and told that Argentine sovereignty must be a pre-condition of any talks. Returning to London on 11 April, he found the British cabinet in no mood for compromise. Haig flew back to Washington before returning to Buenos Aires for a final protracted round of talks. These made little progress, but just as Haig and his mission were leaving, they were told that Galtieri would meet them at the airport VIP lounge to make an important concession; however, this was cancelled at the last minute. On 30 April, the Reagan administration announced that they would be publicly supporting the United Kingdom.

== British task force ==


The nuclear-powered submarine set sail from Faslane, Scotland on 4 April. The two aircraft carriers and and their escort vessels left Portsmouth, England only a day later. On its return to Southampton from a world cruise on 7 April, the ocean liner was requisitioned and set sail two days later with the 3 Commando Brigade aboard. The ocean liner &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; was also requisitioned, and left Southampton on 12 May, with the 5th Infantry Brigade on board. The whole task force eventually comprised 127 ships: 43 Royal Navy vessels, 22 Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships, and 62 merchant ships.

The retaking of the Falkland Islands was considered extremely difficult. The chances of a British counter-invasion succeeding were assessed by the US Navy, according to historian Arthur L. Herman, as &quot;a military impossibility&quot;. Firstly, the British were significantly constrained by the disparity in deployable air cover. The British had 42 aircraft (28 Sea Harriers and 14 Harrier GR.3s) available for air combat operations, against approximately 122 serviceable jet fighters, of which about 50 were used as air superiority fighters and the remainder as strike aircraft, in Argentina&#x27;s air forces during the war. Crucially, the British lacked airborne early warning and control (AEW) aircraft. Planning also considered the Argentine surface fleet and the threat posed by Exocet-equipped vessels or the two Type 209 submarines.

By mid-April, the Royal Air Force had set up an airbase on RAF Ascension Island, co-located with Wideawake Airfield, on the mid-Atlantic British overseas territory of Ascension Island. They included a sizeable force of Avro Vulcan B Mk 2 bombers, Handley Page Victor K Mk 2 refuelling aircraft, and McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR Mk 2 fighters to protect them. Meanwhile, the main British naval task force arrived at Ascension to prepare for active service. A small force had already been sent south to recapture South Georgia.

Encounters began in April; the British Task Force was shadowed by Boeing 707 aircraft of the Argentine Air Force during their travel to the south. Several of these flights were intercepted by Sea Harriers outside the British-imposed Total Exclusion Zone; the unarmed 707s were not attacked because diplomatic moves were still in progress and the UK had not yet decided to commit itself to armed force. On 23 April, a Brazilian commercial Douglas DC-10 from VARIG Airlines en route to South Africa was intercepted by British Harriers who visually identified the civilian plane.

=== Recapture of South Georgia and the attack on &quot;Santa Fe&quot; ===

The South Georgia force, Operation Paraquet, under the command of Major Guy Sheridan RM, consisted of Marines from 42 Commando, a troop of the Special Air Service (SAS) and Special Boat Service (SBS) troops who were intended to land as reconnaissance forces for an invasion by the Royal Marines, a total of 240 men. All were embarked on . First to arrive was the HMS &quot;Conqueror&quot; on 19 April, and the island was over-flown by a Handley Page Victor aircraft with radar-mapping equipment on 20 April, to establish that no Argentine ships were in the vicinity.
The first landings of SAS and SBS troops took place on 21 April, but an ill-advised mission to establish an SAS observation post on the Fortuna Glacier had to be withdrawn after two helicopters crashed in fog and high winds. On 23 April, a submarine alert was sounded and operations were halted, with &quot;Tidespring&quot; being withdrawn to deeper water to avoid interception. On 24 April, British forces regrouped and headed in to attack.

On 25 April, after resupplying the Argentine garrison in South Georgia, the submarine was spotted on the surface by a Westland Wessex HAS Mk 3 helicopter from , which attacked the Argentine submarine with depth charges. launched a Westland Wasp HAS.Mk.1 helicopter, and launched a Westland Lynx HAS Mk 2. The Lynx launched a torpedo, and strafed the submarine with its pintle-mounted general purpose machine gun; the Wessex also fired on &quot;Santa Fe&quot; with its GPMG. The Wasp from as well as two other Wasps launched from fired AS-12 ASM antiship missiles at the submarine, scoring hits. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; was damaged badly enough to prevent her from diving. The crew abandoned the submarine at the jetty at King Edward Point on South Georgia.

With &quot;Tidespring&quot; now far out to sea and the Argentine forces augmented by the submarine&#x27;s crew, Major Sheridan decided to gather the 76 men he had and make a direct assault that day. After a short forced march by the British troops and a naval bombardment demonstration by two Royal Navy vessels (&quot;Antrim&quot; and &quot;Plymouth&quot;), the Argentine forces, a total of 190 men, surrendered without resistance to the Royal Marines. The message sent from the naval force at South Georgia to London was, &quot;Be pleased to inform Her Majesty that the White Ensign flies alongside the Union Jack in South Georgia. God Save the Queen.&quot; The Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, broke the news to the media, telling them to &quot;Just rejoice at that news, and congratulate our forces and the Marines!&quot;

=== Black Buck raids ===
On 1 May, British operations on the Falklands opened with the &quot;Black Buck 1&quot; attack (of a series of five) on the airfield at Stanley. A Vulcan bomber from Ascension flew an round trip, dropping conventional bombs across the runway at Stanley. The mission required repeated aerial refuelling using several Victor K2 tanker aircraft operating in concert, including tanker-to-tanker refuelling.

The overall effect of the raids on the war is difficult to determine; historian Lawrence Freedman, who was given access to official sources, comments that the significance of the Vulcan raids remains a subject of controversy. Although they took pressure off the small Sea Harrier force, the raids were costly and used a great deal of resources. The runway was cratered by only one of the twenty one bombs, with the single hit to the edge of the runway probably the best that could have been expected. Contrary to some reports, this reduced the capability of the runway to operate Mirage III fast jets but not other, smaller jet fighters, the Pucara, and the Hercules C-130, nor did it cause the Argentine air force to deploy Mirage IIIs to defend the capital. Some sources have claimed that, as a result of the raid, the Argentines realised that their mainland was vulnerable and fighter aircraft were redeployed from the theatre to bases further north, but later Argentine sources confirm that the Vulcan raids did not influence Argentina&#x27;s decision to move some of its Mirage IIIs from southern Argentina to the Buenos Aires Defence Zone. This dissuasive effect was watered down when British officials made clear that there would not be strikes on air bases in Argentina. The raids were later dismissed as propaganda by Falklands veteran Commander Nigel Ward.

Of the five Black Buck raids, three were against Stanley Airfield, with the other two being anti-radar missions using Shrike anti-radiation missiles.

=== Escalation of the air war ===

The Falklands had only three airfields. The longest and only paved runway was at the capital, Stanley, and even that was too short to support fast jets. Therefore, the Argentines were forced to launch their major strikes from the mainland, severely hampering their efforts at forward staging, combat air patrols, and close air support over the islands. The effective loiter time of incoming Argentine aircraft was low, limiting the ability of fighters to protect attack aircraft, which were often compelled to attack the first target of opportunity, rather than selecting the most lucrative target.

The first major Argentine strike force comprised 36 aircraft (A-4 Skyhawks, IAI Daggers, English Electric Canberras, and Mirage III escorts), and was sent on 1 May, in the belief that the British invasion was imminent or landings had already taken place. Only a section of Grupo 6 (flying IAI Dagger aircraft) found ships, which were firing at Argentine defences near the islands. The Daggers managed to attack the ships and return safely. This greatly boosted the morale of the Argentine pilots, who now knew they could survive an attack against modern warships, protected by radar ground clutter from the islands and by using a late pop up profile. Meanwhile, other Argentine aircraft were intercepted by BAE Sea Harriers operating from . A Dagger and a Canberra were shot down.

Combat broke out between Sea Harrier FRS Mk 1 fighters of No. 801 Naval Air Squadron and Mirage III fighters of Grupo 8. Both sides refused to fight at the other&#x27;s best altitude, until two Mirages finally descended to engage. One was shot down by an AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missile (AAM), while the other escaped but was damaged and without enough fuel to return to its mainland airbase. The plane made for Stanley, where it fell victim to friendly fire from the Argentine defenders.

As a result of this experience, Argentine Air Force staff decided to employ A-4 Skyhawks and Daggers only as strike units, the Canberras only during the night, and Mirage IIIs (without air refuelling capability or any capable AAM) as decoys to lure away the British Sea Harriers. The decoying would be later extended with the formation of the Escuadrón Fénix, a squadron of civilian jets flying 24 hours a day, simulating strike aircraft preparing to attack the fleet. On one of these flights on 7 June, an Air Force Learjet 35A was shot down by HMS Exeter, killing the squadron commander, Vice Commodore Rodolfo de la Colina, the highest-ranking Argentine officer to die in the war. British command was concerned about the high attrition of Harriers brought down by anti-air, and committed to use them predominately for air superiority. The Harriers were observed to be far more effective than ship-launched missiles to destroy attacking Argentine aircraft, however at times the operations of Harriers in the air would interfere with a vessel&#x27;s anti-air systems.

Stanley was used as an Argentine strongpoint throughout the conflict. Despite the Black Buck and Harrier raids on Stanley airfield (no fast jets were stationed there for air defence) and overnight shelling by detached ships, it was never out of action entirely. Stanley was defended by a mixture of surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems (Franco-German Roland and British Tigercat) and light anti-aircraft guns, including Swiss-built Oerlikon 35 mm twin cannons and 30 mm Hispano-Suiza cannon and German Rheinmetall 20 mm twin anti-aircraft cannons. More of the anti-aircraft guns were deployed to the airstrip at Goose Green. Lockheed Hercules transport night flights brought supplies, weapons, vehicles, and fuel, and airlifted out the wounded up until the end of the conflict.

The only Argentine Hercules shot down by the British was lost on 1 June when TC-63 was intercepted by a Sea Harrier in daylight as it was searching for the British fleet north-east of the islands, after the Argentine Navy retired its last SP-2H Neptune due to unreliability.

Various options to attack the home base of the five Argentine Étendards at Río Grande were examined and discounted (Operation Mikado); subsequently five Royal Navy submarines were lined up, submerged, on the edge of Argentina&#x27;s territorial limit to provide early warning of bombing raids on the British task force.

Operation Folklore was a plan to deploy two Canberra PR.9 aircraft of No. 39 Squadron RAF, disguised in Chilean Air Force markings, to the Chilean air base at Punta Arenas, with the intention of undertaking high-level photo-reconnaissance flights over the Falklands; however the Canberras had reached Belize when the operation was abandoned after part of the plan had been reported in the British press. Operation Acme was the deployment of a single Nimrod R.1 surveillance aircraft of No. 51 Squadron RAF to the Chilean base at Isla San Félix to gather signals intelligence from Argentinian forces in the Falklands; three sorties were conducted, the last on 17 May narrowly avoided being shot down by the Chileans, leading to the cancellation of the operation. More successful was Operation Fingent, the placement of a Marconi S259 radar on high ground in Tierra del Fuego from where it could monitor movements at southern Argentinian air bases; the RAF crew wore civilian clothes in the guise of a sales team. Information was passed to Northwood and the Task Force by means of Operation Shutter, a US supplied SATCOM system installed at the Chilean Air Force headquarters in Santiago and operated by two soldiers of the Royal Corps of Signals.

=== Sinking of ARA &quot;General Belgrano&quot; ===

On 30 April, the British government had brought into force a Total Exclusion Zone (TEZ) to replace the previous Maritime Exclusion Zone; aircraft as well as ships of any nation were liable to be attacked inside it, if they were aiding the Argentine occupation. Admiral Sandy Woodward&#x27;s carrier battle group of twelve warships and three supply ships entered the TEZ on 1 May, shortly before the first Black Buck raid, intending to degrade Argentine air and sea forces before the arrival of the amphibious group two weeks later. In anticipation, Admiral Anaya had deployed all his available warships into three task groups. The first was centred around the aircraft carrier with two old but missile-armed destroyers, and a second comprised three modern frigates. Both these groups were intended to approach the TEZ from the north. A third group approaching from the south was led by the Second World War-vintage Argentine light cruiser ; although old, her large guns and heavy armour made her a serious threat, and she was escorted by two modern Type 42 guided-missile destroyers, armed with Exocet missiles.

On 1 May, the British nuclear-powered submarine (one of three patrolling the TEZ) located the &quot;Belgrano&quot; group and followed it until the following day, when it was about 12 hours away from the Task Force and just outside the Total Exclusion Zone. Admiral Woodward was aware of the Argentine carrier group approaching from the other direction and ordered the cruiser to be attacked to avoid being caught in a pincer movement; he was unaware that the &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; had failed to gain enough headwind to launch her aircraft. The order to sink the cruiser was confirmed by the War Cabinet in London and the &quot;General Belgrano&quot; was hit by two torpedoes at 4 pm local time on 2 May, sinking an hour later. 321 members of &quot;General Belgrano&quot;″s crew, along with two civilians on board the ship, died in the incident. More than 700 men were eventually rescued from the open ocean despite cold seas and stormy weather, enduring up to 30 hours in overcrowded life rafts. The loss of &quot;General Belgrano&quot; drew heavy criticism from Latin American countries and from opponents of the war in Britain; support for the British cause wavered amongst some European allies, but the United States remained supportive.

The sinking had a crucial strategic effect: the elimination of the Argentine naval threat. After her loss, the entire Argentine fleet, with the exception of the diesel-powered submarine , returned to port and did not leave again during the fighting. This had the secondary effect of allowing the British to redeploy their nuclear submarines to the coast of Argentina, where they were able to provide early warning of outgoing air attacks leaving mainland bases.
The sinking generated significant controversy, including disagreement about the exact nature of the exclusion zone and whether &quot;General Belgrano&quot; had been returning to port at the time of the sinking. However, in 2003 the ship&#x27;s captain, Hector Bonzo, stated to a documentary crew that &quot;General Belgrano&quot; had been manoeuvring, not sailing away from the exclusion zone, and that he had orders to sink any British ship he could find.
In a separate incident later that night, British forces engaged an Argentine patrol gunboat, the , that was searching for the crew of an Argentine Air Force Canberra light bomber shot down on 1 May. Two Royal Navy Lynx helicopters, from and , fired four Sea Skua missiles at her. Badly damaged and with eight crew dead, &quot;Alferez Sobral&quot; managed to return to Puerto Deseado two days later. The Canberra&#x27;s crew were never found.

=== Sinking of HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot; ===

On 4 May, two days after the sinking of &quot;General Belgrano&quot;, the British lost the Type 42 destroyer to fire following an Exocet missile strike from the Argentine 2nd Naval Air Fighter/Attack Squadron.

&quot;Sheffield&quot; had been ordered forward with two other Type 42s to provide a long-range radar and medium-high altitude missile picket far from the British carriers. She was struck amidships, with devastating effect, ultimately killing 20 crew members and severely injuring 24 others. The ship was abandoned several hours later, gutted and deformed by fires. For four days she was kept afloat for inspections and the hope that she might attract Argentine submarines which could be hunted by helicopter. The decision was then taken to tow her to Ascension, but while under tow by , she finally sank east of the Falklands on 10 May.

The incident is described in detail by Admiral Woodward in his book &quot;One Hundred Days&quot;, in Chapter One. Woodward was a former commanding officer of &quot;Sheffield&quot;. The destruction of &quot;Sheffield&quot;, the first Royal Navy ship sunk in action since the Second World War, had a profound impact on the War Cabinet and the British public as a whole, bringing home the fact that the conflict was now an actual shooting war.

=== Diplomatic activity ===
The tempo of operations increased throughout the first half of May as the United Nations&#x27; attempts to mediate a peace were rejected by the Argentines. The final British negotiating position was presented to Argentina by UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar on 18 May 1982. In it, the British abandoned their previous &quot;red-line&quot; that British administration of the islands should be restored on the withdrawal of Argentine forces, as supported by United Nations Security Council Resolution 502.

Instead, it proposed a UN administrator should supervise the mutual withdrawal of both Argentine and British forces, then govern the islands in consultation with the representative institutions of the islands, including Argentines, although no Argentines lived there. Reference to &quot;self-determination&quot; of the islanders was dropped and the British proposed that future negotiations over the sovereignty of the islands should be conducted by the UN. However, the proposals were rejected by the Argentines on the same day.

=== Special forces operations ===
Given the threat to the British fleet posed by the Étendard-Exocet combination, plans were made to use C-130s to fly in SAS troops to attack the home base of the five Étendards at Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego. The operation was codenamed &quot;Mikado&quot;. The operation was later scrapped, after acknowledging that its chances of success were limited, and replaced with a plan to use the submarine to drop SBS marines several miles offshore at night for them to make their way to the coast aboard rubber inflatables and proceed to destroy Argentina&#x27;s remaining Exocet stockpile - which did not exist at their objective.

An SAS reconnaissance team was dispatched to carry out preparations for a seaborne infiltration. A Westland Sea King helicopter carrying the assigned team took off from HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; on the night of 17 May, but bad weather forced it to land from its target and the mission was aborted. The pilot flew to Chile, landed south of Punta Arenas, and dropped off the SAS team. The helicopter&#x27;s crew of three then destroyed the aircraft, surrendered to Chilean police on 25 May, and were repatriated to the UK after interrogation. The discovery of the burnt-out helicopter attracted considerable international attention. Meanwhile, the SAS team crossed the border and penetrated into Argentina, but cancelled their mission after the Argentines suspected an SAS operation and deployed some troops to search for them. The SAS men were able to return to Chile and took a civilian flight back to the UK.

On 14 May, the SAS carried out a raid on Pebble Island on the Falklands, where the Argentine Navy had taken over a grass airstrip map for FMA IA 58 Pucará light ground-attack aircraft and Beechcraft T-34 Mentors, which resulted in the destruction of several aircraft.

On 15 May, SBS teams were inserted by HMS &quot;Brilliant&quot; at Grantham Sound to reconnoitre and observe the landing beaches at San Carlos Bay. On the evening of 20 May, the day before the main landings, an SBS troop and artillery observers were landed by Wessex helicopters for an assault on an Argentine observation post at Fanning Head which overlooked the entrance of the bay; meanwhile, the SAS conducted a diversionary raid at Darwin.

== Air attacks ==

In the landing zone, the limitations of the British ships&#x27; anti-aircraft defences were demonstrated in the sinking of on 21 May which was hit by nine bombs, and on 24 May when attempts to defuze unexploded bombs failed. Out at sea with the carrier battle group, was struck by an air-launched Exocet on 25 May, which caused the loss of three out of four Chinook and five Wessex helicopters as well as their maintenance equipment and facilities, together with runway-building equipment and tents. This was a severe blow from a logistical perspective. Twelve of her crew members were killed.

Also lost on 25 May was , a sister to , whilst in company with after being ordered to act as a decoy to draw away Argentine aircraft from other ships at San Carlos Bay. and were moderately damaged.
Many British ships escaped being sunk because of limitations imposed by circumstances on Argentine pilots. To avoid the highest concentration of British air defences, Argentine pilots released bombs at very low altitude, and hence those bomb fuzes did not have sufficient time to arm before impact. The low release of the retarded bombs (some of which the British had sold to the Argentines years earlier) meant that many never exploded, as there was insufficient time in the air for them to arm themselves. The pilots would have been aware of this—but due to the high concentration required to avoid surface-to-air missiles, anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA), and British Sea Harriers, many failed to climb to the necessary release point. The Argentine forces solved the problem by fitting improvised retarding devices, allowing the pilots to effectively employ low-level bombing attacks on 8 June.
Thirteen bombs hit British ships without detonating. Lord Craig, the retired Marshal of the Royal Air Force, is said to have remarked: &quot;Six better fuzes and we would have lost&quot; although &quot;Ardent&quot; and &quot;Antelope&quot; were both lost despite the failure of bombs to explode, and &quot;Argonaut&quot; was put out of action. The fuzes were functioning correctly, and the bombs were simply released from too low an altitude. The Argentines lost 22 aircraft in the attacks.

In his autobiographical account of the Falklands War, Admiral Woodward blamed the BBC World Service for disclosing information that led the Argentines to change the retarding devices on the bombs. The World Service reported the lack of detonations after receiving a briefing on the matter from a Ministry of Defence official. He describes the BBC as being more concerned with being &quot;fearless seekers after truth&quot; than with the lives of British servicemen. Colonel &#x27;H&#x27;. Jones levelled similar accusations against the BBC after they disclosed the impending British attack on Goose Green by 2 Para.
On 30 May, two Super Étendards, one carrying Argentina&#x27;s last remaining Exocet, escorted by four A-4C Skyhawks each with two 500 lb bombs, took off to attack &quot;Invincible&quot;. Argentine intelligence had sought to determine the position of the carriers from analysis of aircraft flight routes from the task force to the islands. However, the British had a standing order that all aircraft conduct a low level transit when leaving or returning to the carriers to disguise their position. This tactic compromised the Argentine attack, which focused on a group of escorts south of the carrier group. Two of the attacking Skyhawks were shot down by Sea Dart missiles fired by HMS &quot;Exeter&quot;, with HMS &quot;Avenger&quot; claiming to have shot down the Exocet missile with her 4.5&quot; gun (although this claim is disputed). No damage was caused to any British vessels. During the war, Argentina claimed to have damaged &quot;Invincible&quot; and continues to do so, although no evidence of any such damage has been produced or uncovered.

== Land battles ==
=== San Carlos – &quot;Bomb Alley&quot;===
During the night of 21 May, the British Amphibious Task Group under the command of Commodore Michael Clapp (Commodore, Amphibious Warfare – COMAW) mounted Operation Sutton, the amphibious landing on beaches around San Carlos Water, on the northwestern coast of East Falkland facing onto Falkland Sound. The bay, known as &quot;Bomb Alley&quot; by British forces, was the scene of repeated air attacks by low-flying Argentine jets.

The men of 3 Commando Brigade were put ashore as follows: 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment (2 Para) from the RORO ferry &quot;Norland&quot; and 40 Commando Royal Marines from the amphibious ship were landed at San Carlos (Blue Beach), 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment (3 Para) from the amphibious ship was landed at Port San Carlos (Green Beach) and 45 Commando from RFA &quot;Stromness&quot; was landed at Ajax Bay (Red Beach). Notably, the waves of eight LCUs and eight LCVPs were led by Major Ewen Southby-Tailyour, who had commanded the Falklands detachment NP8901 from March 1978 to 1979. 42 Commando on the ocean liner was a tactical reserve. Units from the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, etc. and armoured reconnaissance vehicles were also put ashore with the landing craft, the Round Table-class LSL and mexeflote barges. Rapier missile launchers were carried as underslung loads of Sea Kings for rapid deployment.

By dawn the next day, they had established a secure beachhead from which to conduct offensive operations. Brigadier Julian Thompson established his brigade headquarters in dugouts near San Carlos Settlement.

=== Goose Green ===

From early on 27 May until 28 May, 2 Para approached and attacked Darwin and Goose Green, which was held by the Argentine 12th Infantry Regiment. 2 Para’s 500 men had naval gunfire support from HMS &quot;Arrow&quot; and artillery support from 8 Commando Battery of the Royal Artillery. After a tough struggle that lasted all night and into the next day, the British won the battle; in all, 18 British and 47 Argentine soldiers were killed. A total of 961 Argentine troops (including 202 Argentine Air Force personnel of the &quot;Condor&quot; airfield) were taken prisoner.

The BBC announced the taking of Goose Green on the BBC World Service before it had actually happened. During this attack Lieutenant Colonel H. Jones, the commanding officer of 2 Para, was killed at the head of his battalion while charging into the well-prepared Argentine positions. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

With the sizeable Argentine force at Goose Green out of the way, British forces were now able to break out of the San Carlos beachhead. On 27 May, men of 45 Cdo and 3 Para started a loaded march across East Falkland towards the coastal settlement of Teal Inlet.

=== Special forces on Mount Kent ===
Meanwhile, 42 Commando prepared to move by helicopter to Mount Kent. Unbeknownst to senior British officers, the Argentine generals were determined to tie down the British troops in the Mount Kent area, and on 27 and 28 May they sent transport aircraft loaded with Blowpipe surface-to-air missiles and commandos (602nd Commando Company and 601st National Gendarmerie Special Forces Squadron) to Stanley. This operation was known as &quot;Autoimpuesta&quot; (&quot;Self-imposed&quot;).

For the next week, the SAS and the Mountain and Arctic Warfare Cadre (M&amp;AWC) of 3 Commando Brigade waged intense patrol battles with patrols of the volunteers&#x27; 602nd Commando Company under Major Aldo Rico, normally second in Command of the 22nd Mountain Infantry Regiment. Throughout 30 May, Royal Air Force Harriers were active over Mount Kent. One of them, Harrier &quot;XZ963&quot;, flown by Squadron Leader Jerry Pook—responding to a call for help from D Squadron—attacked Mount Kent&#x27;s eastern lower slopes, which led to its loss through small-arms fire. Pook was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.
On 31 May, the M&amp;AWC defeated Argentine Special Forces at the skirmish at Top Malo House. A 13-strong Argentine Army Commando detachment (Captain José Vercesi&#x27;s 1st Assault Section, 602nd Commando Company) found itself trapped in a small shepherd&#x27;s house at Top Malo. The Argentine commandos fired from windows and doorways and then took refuge in a stream bed from the burning house. Completely surrounded, they fought 19 M&amp;AWC marines under Captain Rod Boswell for 45 minutes until, with their ammunition almost exhausted, they elected to surrender.

Three Cadre members were badly wounded. On the Argentine side, there were two dead, including Lieutenant Ernesto Espinoza and Sergeant Mateo Sbert (who were posthumously decorated for their bravery). Only five Argentines were left unscathed. As the British secured Top Malo House, Lieutenant Fraser Haddow&#x27;s M&amp;AWC patrol came down from Malo Hill, brandishing a large Union Flag. One wounded Argentine soldier, Lieutenant Horacio Losito, commented that their escape route would have taken them through Haddow&#x27;s position.

601st Commando tried to move forward to rescue 602nd Commando Company on Estancia Mountain. Spotted by 42 Commando, they were engaged with L16 81mm mortars and forced to withdraw to Two Sisters mountain. The leader of 602nd Commando Company on Estancia Mountain realised his position had become untenable and after conferring with fellow officers ordered a withdrawal.

The Argentine operation also saw the extensive use of helicopter support to position and extract patrols; the 601st Combat Aviation Battalion also suffered casualties. At about 11:00 am on 30 May, an Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma helicopter was brought down by a shoulder-launched FIM-92 Stinger surface-to-air missile (SAM) fired by the SAS in the vicinity of Mount Kent. Six Argentine National Gendarmerie Special Forces were killed and eight more wounded in the crash.

As Brigadier Thompson commented: 

=== Bluff Cove and Fitzroy ===

By 1 June, with the arrival of a further British troops of the 5th Infantry Brigade, the new British divisional commander, Major General Jeremy Moore RM, had sufficient force to start planning an offensive against Stanley. During this build-up, the Argentine air assaults on the British naval forces continued, killing 56. Of the dead, 32 were from the Welsh Guards on RFA &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; and RFA &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; on 8 June. According to Surgeon-Commander Rick Jolly of the Falklands Field Hospital, more than 150 men suffered burns and injuries of some kind in the attack, including Simon Weston.

The Guards were sent to support an advance along the southern approach to Stanley. On 2 June, a small advance party of 2 Para moved to Swan Inlet house in a number of Army Westland Scout helicopters. Telephoning ahead to Fitzroy, they discovered that the area was clear of Argentines and (exceeding their authority) commandeered the one remaining RAF Chinook helicopter to frantically ferry another contingent of 2 Para ahead to Fitzroy (a settlement on Port Pleasant) and Bluff Cove (a settlement on Port Fitzroy).

This uncoordinated advance caused great difficulties in planning for the commanders of the combined operation, as they now found themselves with of indefensible positions, strung along their southern flank. Support could not be sent by air as the single remaining Chinook was already heavily oversubscribed. The soldiers could march, but their equipment and heavy supplies would need to be ferried by sea.

Plans were drawn up for half the Welsh Guards to march light on the night of 2 June, whilst the Scots Guards and the second half of the Welsh Guards were to be ferried from San Carlos Water in the Landing Ship Logistics (LSL) &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; and the landing platform dock (LPD) &quot;Intrepid&quot; on the night of 5 June. &quot;Intrepid&quot; was planned to stay one day and unload itself and as much of &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; as possible, leaving the next evening for the relative safety of San Carlos. Escorts would be provided for this day, after which &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; would be left to unload using a Mexeflote (a powered raft) for as long as it took to finish.

Political pressure from above to not risk the LPD forced Commodore Michael Clapp to alter this plan. Two lower-value LSLs would be sent, but with no suitable beaches to land on, &quot;Intrepid&quot;″s landing craft would need to accompany them to unload. A complicated operation across several nights with &quot;Intrepid&quot; and her sister ship sailing half-way to dispatch their craft was devised.

The attempted overland march by half the Welsh Guards failed, possibly as they refused to march light and attempted to carry their equipment. They returned to San Carlos and landed directly at Bluff Cove when &quot;Fearless&quot; dispatched her landing craft. &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; sailed on the night of 6 June and was joined by &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; at dawn on 7 June. Anchored apart in Port Pleasant, the landing ships were near Fitzroy, the designated landing point. The landing craft should have been able to unload the ships to that point relatively quickly, but confusion over the ordered disembarkation point (the first half of the Guards going direct to Bluff Cove) resulted in the senior Welsh Guards infantry officer aboard insisting that his troops should be ferried the far longer distance directly to Port Fitzroy/Bluff Cove. The alternative was for the infantrymen to march via the recently repaired Bluff Cove bridge (destroyed by retreating Argentine combat engineers) to their destination, a journey of around .

There are conflicting accounts of the causes for the delay in disembarking the Welsh Guards contingent. One narrative posits that on &quot;Sir Galahad&quot;″s stern ramp there was an argument about what to do. The officers on board were told that they could not sail to Bluff Cove in daylight. They were told that they had to get their men off ship and onto the beach as soon as possible as the ships were vulnerable to enemy aircraft. It would take 20 minutes to transport the men to shore using the LCU and Mexeflote. They would then have the choice of walking the seven miles to Bluff Cove or wait until dark to sail there. The officers on board said that they would remain on board until dark and then sail. They refused to take their men off the ship. They possibly doubted that the bridge had been repaired due to the presence on board &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; of the Royal Engineer Troop whose job it was to repair the bridge. The Welsh Guards were keen to rejoin the rest of their Battalion, who were potentially facing the enemy without their support. They had also not seen any enemy aircraft since landing at San Carlos and may have been overconfident in the air defences. Royal Marines Major Ewen Southby-Tailyour gave a direct order for the men to leave the ship and go to the beach; the order was ignored.

However, a contemporary Royal Navy report, partially declassified in 2024, throws into question the validity of this account. The investigative report states that &quot;At no time was a direct order to disembark given to...[the officer commanding the Welsh Guards]...by a superior officer&quot;. Additionally, it is claimed that &quot;Sir Tristram&quot;, although receiving signals advising of &quot;Sir Galahad&quot;&#x27;s arrival, failed to pass these onto the officers responsible for her unloading, who &quot;...had not been warned of the arrival of the ship, nor of the nature of her cargo...no preparation had been made for the timely off-load of the new arrival.&quot;

The longer journey time of the landing craft taking the troops directly to Bluff Cove and the ambiguity over orders being issued to this effect caused an enormous delay in unloading. This had disastrous consequences, since the ships were visible to Argentine troops on Mount Harriet, some distant. Without escorts, having not yet established their air defence, and still almost fully laden, the two LSLs in Port Pleasant were sitting targets for eight Argentine A-4 Skyhawks. A coordinated sortie by six Daggers attacked HMS &quot;Plymouth&quot;, which had the effect of drawing off the patrolling Sea Harriers. At 17.00, the Skyhawks attacked from seaward, hitting &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; with three bombs; although none exploded, they caused fierce fires which quickly grew out of control. Two bombs hit &quot;Sir Tristram&quot;, also starting fires and causing the ship to be abandoned, but the damage was not as serious. Three Sea King and a Wessex helicopter ferried the wounded to an advanced dressing station which was set up on the shore.

British casualties were 48 killed and 115 wounded. Three Argentine pilots were also killed. The air strike delayed the scheduled British ground attack on Stanley by two days. The British casualties amounted to two infantry companies, but it was decided not to release detailed casualty figures because intelligence indicated that Argentine commanders believed that a much more severe reverse had been inflicted. However, the disaster at Port Pleasant (although often known as Bluff Cove) would provide the world with some of the most sobering images of the war as ITV News video showed helicopters hovering in thick smoke to winch survivors from the burning landing ships.

=== Fall of Stanley ===

On the night of 11 June, after several days of painstaking reconnaissance and logistic build-up, British forces launched a brigade-sized night attack against the heavily defended ring of high ground surrounding Stanley. Units of 3 Commando Brigade, supported by naval gunfire from several Royal Navy ships, simultaneously attacked in the Battle of Mount Harriet, Battle of Two Sisters, and Battle of Mount Longdon. Mount Harriet was taken at a cost of 2 British and 18 Argentine soldiers. At Two Sisters, the British faced both enemy resistance and friendly fire but managed to capture their objectives. The toughest battle was at Mount Longdon. British forces were bogged down by rifle, mortar, machine gun, artillery and sniper fire, and ambushes. Despite this, the British continued their advance.

During this battle, 14 were killed when , straying too close to shore while returning from the gun line, was struck by an improvised trailer-based Exocet MM38 launcher taken from the destroyer by Argentine Navy technicians. On the same day, Sergeant Ian McKay of 4 Platoon, B Company, 3 Para died in a grenade attack on an Argentine bunker; he received a posthumous Victoria Cross for his actions. After a night of fierce fighting, all objectives were secured. Both sides suffered heavy losses.

The second phase of attacks began on the night of 13 June, and the momentum of the initial assault was maintained. 2 Para, with light armour support from the Blues and Royals, captured Wireless Ridge, with the loss of 3 British and 25 Argentine lives, and the 2nd Battalion, Scots Guards captured Mount Tumbledown at the Battle of Mount Tumbledown, which cost 10 British and 30 Argentine lives. A simultaneous special forces raid by the SAS and SBS in fast boats to attack the oil tanks in Stanley Harbour was beaten off by anti-aircraft guns.

With the last natural defence line at Mount Tumbledown breached, the Argentine town defences of Stanley began to falter. In the morning gloom, one company commander got lost and his junior officers became despondent. Private Santiago Carrizo of the 3rd Regiment described how a platoon commander ordered them to take up positions in the houses and &quot;if a Kelper resists, shoot him&quot;, but the entire company did nothing of the kind. A daylight attack on Mount William by the Gurkhas, delayed from the previous night by the fighting at Tumbledown, ended in anticlimax when the Argentine positions were found to be deserted.

A ceasefire was declared on 14 June and Thatcher announced the commencement of surrender negotiations. The commander of the Argentine garrison in Stanley, Brigade General Mario Menéndez, surrendered to Major General Jeremy Moore the same day.

=== Recapture of South Sandwich Islands ===
On 20 June, the British retook the South Sandwich Islands, which involved accepting the surrender of the Southern Thule Garrison at the Corbeta Uruguay base and declared hostilities over. Argentina had established Corbeta Uruguay in 1976, but prior to 1982 the United Kingdom had contested the existence of the Argentine base only through diplomatic channels.

== Foreign involvement ==
===Commonwealth===
The UK received political support from member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations. Australia, Canada, and New Zealand withdrew their diplomats from Buenos Aires.

====New Zealand====
The New Zealand government expelled the Argentine ambassador following the invasion. The Prime Minister, Robert Muldoon, was in London when the war broke out and in an opinion piece published in &quot;The Times&quot; he said: &quot;The military rulers of Argentina must not be appeased … New Zealand will back Britain all the way.&quot; Broadcasting on the BBC World Service, he told the Falkland Islanders: &quot;This is Rob Muldoon. We are thinking of you and we are giving our full and total support to the British Government in its endeavours to rectify this situation and get rid of the people who have invaded your country.&quot; On 20 May 1982, he announced that New Zealand would make , a , available for use where the British thought fit to release a Royal Navy vessel for the Falklands. In the House of Commons afterwards, Margaret Thatcher said: &quot;…the New Zealand Government and people have been absolutely magnificent in their support for this country [and] the Falkland Islanders, for the rule of liberty and of law&quot;.

====Australia====
Encouraged by the generous response of New Zealand, the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, was rushed into offering to cancel the intended purchase of HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;, which was quickly accepted by the British. However, this left the Royal Australian Navy without a replacement for their only aircraft carrier, , which was in the process of decommissioning.

===France===
The French president, François Mitterrand, declared an embargo on French arms sales and assistance to Argentina. In addition, France allowed UK aircraft and warships use of its port and airfield facilities at Dakar in Senegal and France provided dissimilar aircraft training so that Harrier pilots could train against the French aircraft used by Argentina. French intelligence also cooperated with Britain to prevent Argentina from obtaining more Exocet missiles on the international market. In a 2002 interview, and in reference to this support, John Nott, the then British Defence Secretary, had described France as Britain&#x27;s &#x27;greatest ally&#x27;. In 2012, it came to light that while this support was taking place, a French technical team, employed by Dassault and already in Argentina, remained there throughout the war despite the presidential decree. The team had provided material support to the Argentines, identifying and fixing faults in Exocet missile launchers. John Nott said he had known the French team was there but said its work was thought not to be of any importance. An adviser to the then French government denied any knowledge at the time that the technical team was there. The French DGSE did know the team was there as they had an informant in the team but decried any assistance the team gave: &quot;It&#x27;s bordering on an act of treason, or disobedience to an embargo&quot;. John Nott, when asked if he felt let down by the French said &quot;If you&#x27;re asking me: &#x27;Are the French duplicitous people?&#x27; the answer is: &#x27;Of course they are, and they always have been&quot;. Four Exocet missiles that had been ordered by Peru were prevented by the French government from being delivered by air and, after pressure from Britain who suspected that they would be passed on to Argentina, delayed their release to a Peruvian ship until the conflict was over.

===United States===
Declassified cables show the United States both felt that Thatcher had not considered diplomatic options and feared that a protracted conflict could draw the Soviet Union on Argentina&#x27;s side. The US initially tried to mediate an end to the conflict through shuttle diplomacy, but when Argentina refused the American peace overtures, US Secretary of State Alexander Haig announced that the United States would prohibit arms sales to Argentina and provide material support for British operations. Both houses of the US Congress passed resolutions supporting the American action siding with the United Kingdom.

The US provided the United Kingdom with 200 Sidewinder missiles for use by the Harrier jets, eight Stinger surface-to-air missile systems, Harpoon anti-ship missiles and mortar bombs. On Ascension Island, the underground fuel tanks were empty when the British Task Force arrived in mid-April 1982 and the leading assault ship, , did not have enough fuel to dock when it arrived off the island. The United States diverted a supertanker to replenish both the fuel tanks of ships at anchor there and the storage tanks on the island with approximately of fuel. The Pentagon further committed to providing additional support in the event that the war dragged on into the Southern Hemisphere&#x27;s winter. In that scenario, the US committed tanker aircraft to support Royal Air Force missions in Europe, releasing RAF aircraft to support operations over the Falklands.

The United States allowed the United Kingdom to use American communication satellites for secure communications between submarines in the Southern Ocean and Naval HQ in Britain. The US also passed on satellite imagery (which it publicly denied) and weather forecast data to the British Fleet.

US President Ronald Reagan approved the Royal Navy&#x27;s request to borrow a Sea Harrier-capable (the US Navy had earmarked for this) in the event a British aircraft carrier was lost. The US Navy developed a plan to help the British man the ship with American military contractors, who would likely be retired sailors with knowledge of the ship&#x27;s systems.

===Other OAS members===
====Cuba====
Argentina itself was politically backed by a number of countries in Latin America (though, notably, not Chile). Several members of the Non-Aligned Movement also backed Argentina&#x27;s position; notably, Cuba and Nicaragua led a diplomatic effort to rally non-aligned countries from Africa and Asia to Argentina&#x27;s position. This initiative came as a surprise to Western observers, as Cuba had no diplomatic relations with Argentina&#x27;s right-leaning military junta. British diplomats complained that Cuba had &quot;cynically exploited&quot; the crisis to pursue its normalisation of relations with Latin American countries; Argentina eventually resumed relations with Cuba in 1983; Brazil did so in 1986. According to Leycester Coltman, Cuban president Fidel Castro offered to send troops to reinforce the Argentine garrison in the Falklands and to deploy the Cuban submarine fleet to attack British warships en route to the South Atlantic.

====Peru====
Peru attempted to purchase 12 Exocet missiles from France, to be delivered to Argentina in a failed secret operation. Peru also openly sent &quot;Mirages, pilots and missiles&quot; to Argentina during the war. That nation also supplied the Argentine forces with 40 Strela-2M shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile launchers and three experienced operators to help train in the use of those weapons. Peru had earlier transferred ten Hercules transport planes to Argentina soon after the British Task Force had set sail in April 1982. Nick van der Bijl records that, after the Argentine defeat at Goose Green, Venezuela and Guatemala offered to send paratroopers to the Falklands.

====Chile====
At the outbreak of the war, Chile was in negotiations with Argentina for control over the Beagle Channel and feared Argentina would use similar tactics to secure the channel. During this conflict, Argentina had already rejected two attempts at international mediation and tried to exert military pressure on Chile with an operation to occupy the disputed territory. Considering the situation, Chile refused to support the Argentine position during the war and gave support to the UK in the form of intelligence about the Argentine military and early warning intelligence on Argentine air movements. Throughout the war, Argentina was afraid of a Chilean military intervention in Patagonia and kept some of its best mountain regiments away from the Falklands near the Chilean border as a precaution. The Chilean government also allowed the United Kingdom to requisition the refuelling vessel , which Chile had recently purchased and which had arrived at Arica in Chile on 4 April. The ship left port soon afterwards, bound for Ascension Island through the Panama Canal and stopping at Curaçao en route.

====Brazil====
At the end of May, Brazilian authorities allowed FAA Boeing 707s to refuel at Recife International Airport carrying arms shipments from Libya. When the British Embassy in Brasília became aware of this, the British Secret Intelligence Service devised a plan to sabotage the next flight on the ground, but diplomatic pressure on the Brazilian government to observe their legal duties as a neutral country resulted in no further flights being accepted. On 3 June, an RAF Vulcan on returning from a Black Buck raid on the Falklands, was forced to make an emergency landing at Rio de Janeiro International Airport after damage to its refuelling probe prevented it returning to Ascension Island. The Vulcan and her crew were interned and released seven days later, although an unused Shrike missile that the aircraft had been carrying was retained.

===Soviet Union===
The Soviet Union described the Falklands as &quot;a disputed territory&quot;, recognising Argentina&#x27;s ambitions over the islands, and called for restraint on all sides. Soviet media frequently criticised the UK and US during the war. Significantly, however, the Soviet Union refrained from vetoing and thus made possible UN Security Council Resolution 502 demanding the immediate withdrawal of all Argentine troops from the Falklands. However, the Soviet Union mounted some clandestine logistics operations to assist the Argentines. Days after the invasion by the Argentine forces, the Soviets launched additional intelligence satellites into low Earth orbit covering the southern Atlantic Ocean. Conflicting reports exist on whether Soviet ocean surveillance data might have played a role in the sinking of and .

=== Spain ===
Spain&#x27;s position was one of ambiguity, underpinning the basic dilemma of the Spanish foreign policy regarding the articulation of relationships with Latin America and European communities. On 2 April 1982, the Council of Ministers issued an official note defending principles of decolonisation and against the use of force. Spain abstained in the vote of UN Security Council Resolution 502, a position that Spanish UN representative Jaime de Piniés justified by pointing out that the resolution did not mention the underlying problem of decolonisation. The Spanish stance throughout the conflict contrasted with those of the countries in its immediate vicinity (EEC members and Portugal).

Spanish authorities also foiled a covert attack by the Argentine Naval Intelligence Service on a British warship at Gibraltar, code named Operation Algeciras. Three frogmen, recruited from a former anti-government insurgent group, were to plant mines on a ship&#x27;s hull. The divers travelled to Spain through France, where French security services noted their military diving equipment and alerted their Spanish counterparts. They were covertly monitored as they moved from the Argentine embassy in Madrid to Algeciras, where they were arrested on 17 May by the &quot;Guardia Civil&quot; and deported.

=== Portugal ===
Portugal supported its long-standing ally Britain and the facilities of the Azores were offered to the Royal Navy.

=== EEC ===
The European Economic Community provided economic support by imposing economic sanctions on Argentina. In a meeting on Good Friday, 9 April, at the Egmont Palace, the EEC Political Committee proposed a total import ban from Argentina. Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Luxembourg and Ireland agreed immediately; France, Germany and the Netherlands were persuaded before the meeting ended. Italy, which had close cultural ties with Argentina, consented on the next day.

===Other countries===
====Ireland====
Ireland&#x27;s position altered during the war. As a rotating member of the United Nations Security Council, it supported Resolution 502. However, on 4 May, the Fianna Fáil government led by Charles Haughey decided to oppose EEC sanctions and called for a ceasefire. Haughey justified this as complying with Irish neutrality. Historians have suggested it was an opportunistic appeal to anti-British sentiment and reaction to Haughey&#x27;s being sidelined during the 1981 republican hunger strike. The strain on British–Irish relations eased when Haughey&#x27;s government fell in November 1982.

====Israel====
According to the book &quot;Operation Israel&quot;, advisers from Israel Aerospace Industries were already in Argentina and continued their work during the conflict. The book also claims that Israel sold weapons and drop tanks to Argentina in a secret operation via Peru.

====Sierra Leone====
The Government of Sierra Leone allowed British task force ships to refuel at Freetown.

====The Gambia====
VC10 transport aircraft landed at Banjul in The Gambia while flying between the UK and Ascension Island.

====Libya====
Through Libya, under Muammar Gaddafi, Argentina received 20 launchers and 60 SA-7 missiles (which Argentina later described as &quot;not effective&quot;), as well as machine guns, mortars and mines. To retrieve the weapons, four trips were made using two Argentine Air Force Boeing 707s which refuelled in Recife with the consent of the Brazilian government.

== Casualties ==
In total, 907 people were killed during the 74 days of the conflict. Additionally, there were Argentine and 777 British injured or wounded.

=== Argentina ===
A total of 649 Argentine servicemen were killed:
* Ejército Argentino (&quot;Army&quot;) – 194 (16 officers, 35 non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and 143 conscript privates)
* Armada de la República Argentina (&quot;Navy&quot;) – 341 (including 321 in and 4 naval aviators)
** IMARA (&quot;Marines&quot;) – 34
* Fuerza Aérea Argentina (&quot;Air Force&quot;) – 55 (including 31 pilots and 14 ground crew)
* Gendarmería Nacional Argentina (&quot;Border Guard&quot;) – 7
* Prefectura Naval Argentina (&quot;Coast Guard&quot;) – 2

=== United Kingdom ===
A total of 255 British servicemen were killed:
* Royal Navy – 86 + 2 Hong Kong laundrymen (see below)
* Royal Marines – 27 (2 officers, 14 NCOs and 11 marines)
* Royal Fleet Auxiliary – 4 + 6 Hong Kong sailors
* Merchant Navy – 6
* British Army – 123 (7 officers, 40 NCOs and 76 privates)
* Royal Air Force – 1 (1 officer)
Of the 86 Royal Navy personnel, 22 were lost in , 19 + 1 lost in , 19 + 1 lost in and 13 lost in . Fourteen naval cooks were among the dead, the largest number from any one branch in the Royal Navy.

Thirty-three of the British Army&#x27;s dead came from the Welsh Guards (32 of whom died on the RFA &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; in the Bluff Cove Air Attacks), 21 from the 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, 18 from the 2nd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, 19 from the Special Air Service, 3 each from Royal Signals and Royal Army Medical Corps and 8 from each of the Scots Guards and Royal Engineers. The 1st battalion/7th Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles lost one man.

=== Civilians ===
Three civilians on the Falkland Islands were accidentally killed by British shelling during the night of 11/12 June. It was also reported that HMS &quot;Brilliant&quot;, on an anti-submarine patrol, detected and torpedoed three whales by accident.

=== Red Cross Box ===

Before British offensive operations began, the British and Argentine governments agreed to establish an area on the high seas where both sides could station hospital ships without fear of attack by the other side. This area, a circle 20 nautical miles in diameter, was referred to as the Red Cross Box () and located about north of Falkland Sound. Ultimately, the British stationed four ships (, and and the primary hospital ship SS &quot;Uganda&quot;) within the box, while the Argentines stationed three (, and ).

The hospital ships were non-warships converted to serve as hospital ships. The three British naval vessels were survey vessels and &quot;Uganda&quot; was a passenger liner. &quot;Almirante Irizar&quot; was an icebreaker, &quot;Bahia Paraiso&quot; was an Antarctic supply transport and &quot;Puerto Deseado&quot; was a survey ship. British and Argentine vessels operating within the Box were in radio contact and there was some transfer of patients between hospital ships. For example, the &quot;Uganda&quot; transferred patients to an Argentine hospital ship on four occasions. &quot;Hydra&quot; worked with &quot;Hecla&quot; and &quot;Herald&quot; to take casualties from &quot;Uganda&quot; to Montevideo, Uruguay, where a fleet of Uruguayan ambulances met them. RAF VC10 aircraft then flew the casualties to the UK for transfer to the Princess Alexandra Hospital at RAF Wroughton, near Swindon.

Throughout the conflict, officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) conducted inspections to verify that all concerned were abiding by the rules of the Geneva Conventions. Argentine naval officers also inspected the British casualty ferries in the estuary of the River Plate.

== Aftermath ==
This brief war brought many consequences for all the parties involved, besides the considerable casualty rate and large materiel loss, especially of shipping and aircraft, relative to the deployed military strengths of the opposing sides.

In the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s popularity increased. The success of the Falklands campaign was widely regarded as a factor in the turnaround in fortunes for the Conservative government, who had been trailing behind the SDP–Liberal Alliance in the opinion polls for months before the conflict began. Following the success in the Falklands, the Conservatives returned to the top of the opinion polls by a wide margin and went on to win the following year&#x27;s general election by a landslide. Subsequently, Defence Secretary Nott&#x27;s proposed cuts to the Royal Navy were abandoned.

The islanders had full British citizenship restored in 1983; their quality of life improved through investments made by the UK after the war and by economic liberalisation that had been stalled for fear of angering Argentina. In 1985, a new constitution was enacted, promoting self-government which has continued to devolve power to the islanders. The result of the 2013 Falkland Islands sovereignty referendum was 99.8% of the electorate voting for the islands to remain a British territory, with a voter turnout of 92%. 

In Argentina, defeat in the Falklands War meant that a possible war with Chile was avoided. Further, Argentina returned to a democratic government in the 1983 general election, the first free general election since 1973. It also had a major social impact, destroying the military&#x27;s image as the &quot;moral reserve of the nation&quot; that they had maintained through most of the 20th century.

A detailed study of British veterans of the war commissioned by the UK Ministry of Defence found that between 1982 and 2012, 95 had died from &quot;intentional self-harm and events of undetermined intent (suicides and open verdict deaths)&quot;, a proportion lower than would be expected within the general population over the same period. However, a study of British combat veterans conducted five years after the conflict found that half of the sample group had suffered some symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), while 22% were assessed to have the complete syndrome.

===&quot;Fortress Falklands&quot;===
In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, the British government embarked on a long-term policy of providing the islands with a viable military garrison, known informally as &quot;Fortress Falklands&quot;. Initially, an aircraft carrier was kept in the area until the runway at Stanley Airport could be improved to take conventional RAF fighters. A permanent military complex with a runway designed to take long-haul airliners was constructed in the south of East Falkland, RAF Mount Pleasant, which opened in 1985; an associated deep-water port at Mare Harbour was also constructed. A small military outpost was established at King Edward Point on South Georgia, but it was closed in 2001.

=== Military analysis ===
Militarily, the Falklands conflict remains one of the largest air-naval combat operations between modern forces since the end of the Second World War. As such, it has been the subject of intense study by military analysts and historians. Significant takeaways include the vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles and submarines, the challenges of co-ordinating logistical support for long-distance projections of power, and reconfirmation of the importance of tactical air power, including helicopters.

In 1986, the BBC broadcast the &quot;Horizon&quot; programme &quot;In the Wake of HMS Sheffield&quot;, which discussed lessons learned from the conflict, and measures taken to implement them, such as incorporating greater stealth capabilities and providing better close-in weapon systems for the fleet. The principal British military responses to the Falklands War were the measures adopted in the December 1982 Defence White Paper.

=== Memorials ===

There are several memorials on the Falkland Islands themselves, the most notable of which is the 1982 Liberation Memorial, unveiled in 1984 on the second anniversary of the end of the war. It lists the names of the 255 British military personnel who died during the war and is located in front of the Secretariat Building in Stanley, overlooking Stanley Harbour. The Memorial was funded entirely by the Islanders and is inscribed with the words &quot;In Memory of Those Who Liberated Us&quot;.

During the war, British dead were put into plastic body bags and buried in mass graves. After the war, the bodies were recovered; 14 were reburied at Blue Beach Military Cemetery and 64 were returned to the United Kingdom. Many of the Argentine dead are buried in the Argentine Military Cemetery two kilometers northeast of the small settlement of Darwin, approximately 82 kilometers west of Stanley. The Argentine government declined an offer by the UK to have the bodies repatriated to Argentina.

In addition to memorials on the islands, there is a memorial in the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London to the British war dead. At the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, a Falklands War memorial was unveiled in May 2012 in a service attended by 600 veterans and their families; the names of the fallen were also inscribed on the Armed Forces Memorial at the arboretum, which commemorates all British servicemen killed in action since the end of the Second World War. A memorial to the seamen of the Merchant Navy who died in the war stands at the Tower Hill Memorial in Trinity Square Gardens, London. A memorial to the Royal Marines, known as &quot;The Yomper&quot; was unveiled by Margaret Thatcher in 1992 outside the former Eastney Barracks near Portsmouth. The Falkland Islands Memorial Chapel at Pangbourne College was opened in March 2000 as a commemoration of the lives and sacrifice of all those who served and died in the South Atlantic in 1982.

In Argentina, there are many memorials, museums and murals all over the country. The most important are a cenotaph at Plaza San Martín in Buenos Aires, and a memorial in Ushuaia, declared National Monument.

=== Minefields ===


In 2011 there were 113 uncleared minefields plus unexploded ordnance (UXOs) covering an area of on the Falkland Islands. Of this area, on the Murrell Peninsula were classified as being &quot;suspected minefields&quot;—the area had been heavily pastured for 25 years without incident. It was estimated that these minefields had anti-personnel mines and anti-tank mines.

The UK reported six military personnel injured by mines or UXO in 1982, then two more in 1983. Most military accidents took place in the immediate aftermath of the conflict, while clearing minefields or trying to establish the extent of minefield perimeters, particularly where no detailed records existed. No civilian mine casualties have ever occurred on the islands, and no human casualties from mines or UXO have been reported since 1984.

On 9 May 2008, the Falkland Islands Government asserted that the minefields, which represent 0.1% of the available farmland on the islands &quot;present no long term social or economic difficulties for the Falklands&quot;, and that the impact of clearing the mines would cause more problems than containing them. However, the British Government, in accordance with its commitments under the Mine Ban Treaty had a commitment to clear the mines by the end of 2019.

In May 2012, it was announced that of Stanley Common (which lies between the Stanley – Mount Pleasant road and the shoreline) was made safe and had been opened to the public, opening up a stretch of coastline and a further two kilometres of shoreline along Mullet Creek.

In November 2020, after a final clearance campaign by contractors from Zimbabwe, it was declared that the Falkland Islands were now free of all landmines. A celebration of the event took place on the weekend of 14 November where the final landmine was detonated.

== Press and publicity ==
=== Argentina ===
Selected war correspondents were regularly flown to Port Stanley in military aircraft to report on the war. Back in Buenos Aires, newspapers and magazines reported on &quot;the heroic actions of the largely conscript army and its successes&quot;.

Officers from the intelligence services were attached to the newspapers and &#x27;leaked&#x27; information corroborating the official communiqués from the government. The glossy magazines &quot;Gente&quot; and &quot;Siete Días&quot; swelled to 60 pages with colour photographs of British warships in flames—many of them faked—and bogus eyewitness reports of the Argentine commandos&#x27; guerrilla war on South Georgia (6 May) and an already dead Pucará pilot&#x27;s attack on HMS &quot;Hermes&quot; (Lt. Daniel Antonio Jukic had been killed at Goose Green during a British air strike on 1 May). Most of the faked photos actually came from the tabloid press. One of the best remembered headlines was &quot;Estamos ganando&quot; (&quot;We&#x27;re winning&quot;) from the magazine &quot;Gente&quot;, that would later use variations of it.

The Argentine troops on the Falkland Islands could read &quot;Gaceta Argentina&quot;—a newspaper intended to boost morale among the servicemen. Some of its untruths could easily be unveiled by the soldiers who recovered corpses.

The &quot;Malvinas cause&quot; united the Argentines in a patriotic atmosphere that protected the junta from critics, and even opponents of the military government supported Galtieri; Ernesto Sabato said:
In the Argentine press, false reports that HMS &quot;Hermes&quot; was sunk and HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; had been damaged were circulated after the weekly magazines &quot;Gente&quot; and &quot;La Semana&quot; had received information of naval action from an air force officer in the president&#x27;s office. On 30 April 1982 the Argentine magazine &quot;Tal Cual&quot; showed Prime Minister Thatcher with an eyepatch and the text: &quot;Pirate, witch and assassin. Guilty!&quot; Three British reporters sent to Argentina to cover the war from the Argentine perspective were jailed until the end of the war. The &quot;Madres de Plaza de Mayo&quot; were even exposed to death threats from ordinary people.

=== United Kingdom ===

Seventeen newspaper reporters, two photographers, two radio reporters and three television reporters with five technicians sailed with the Task Force to the war. The Newspaper Publishers&#x27; Association selected them from among 160 applicants, excluding foreign media. The hasty selection resulted in the inclusion of two journalists among the war reporters who were interested only in Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s son Prince Andrew, who was serving in the conflict. The prince flew a helicopter on multiple missions, including Exocet missile decoy and casualty evacuation.

Merchant vessels had the civilian Inmarsat uplink, which enabled written telex and voice report transmissions via satellite. had a facsimile machine that was used to upload 202 pictures from the South Atlantic over the course of the war. The Royal Navy leased bandwidth on the U.S. Defense Satellite Communications System for worldwide communications. Television demands a thousand times the data rate of telephone, but the Ministry of Defence was unsuccessful in convincing the U.S. to allocate more bandwidth.

TV producers suspected that the enquiry was half-hearted, since the Vietnam War television pictures of casualties and traumatised soldiers were recognised as having negative propaganda value. However, the technology only allowed uploading a single frame per 20 minutes—and only if the military satellites were allocated 100% to television transmissions. Videotapes were shipped to Ascension Island, where a broadband satellite uplink was available, resulting in TV coverage being delayed by three weeks.

The press was very dependent on the Royal Navy and was censored on site. Many reporters in the UK knew more about the war than those with the Task Force. Ministry of Defence press briefings in London were characterised by the restrained dictation-speed delivery of its spokesman, Ian McDonald.

The Royal Navy expected the British press to conduct a Second World War-style positive news campaign but the majority of the British media, especially the BBC, reported the war in a neutral fashion. These reporters referred to &quot;the British troops&quot; and &quot;the Argentinian troops&quot; instead of &quot;our lads&quot; and the &quot;Argies&quot;. The two main tabloid papers presented opposing viewpoints: The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; was decidedly anti-war, whilst &quot;The Sun&quot; became well known for headlines such as &quot;Stick It Up Your Junta!&quot;, which, along with the reporting in other tabloids, led to accusations of xenophobia and jingoism. &quot;The Sun&quot; was criticised for its &quot;Gotcha&quot; headline following the sinking of the .

The British Ministry of Defence operated a psychological warfare operation under the codename &quot;Moonshine&quot;, which took the form of a spurious radio station purporting to be from a neutral South American country, but was actually in London, broadcasting to the Falklands and Argentina via a transmitter on Ascension which had been requisitioned from the BBC. Under the name of (&quot;Radio South Atlantic&quot;), the station was operated by a small team of civilians and Spanish-speaking military officers. The first three-hour broadcast was on 19 May and a total of 47 had been made by 15 June when the operation was cancelled. There is some evidence that the Argentines attempted to jam the broadcasts and that some civilian radio receivers were confiscated from soldiers, but the results overall were difficult to assess.

== Cultural impact ==

There were wide-ranging influences on popular culture in both the UK and Argentina, from the immediate postwar period to the present. The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges described the war as &quot;a fight between two bald men over a comb.&quot; The words &quot;yomp&quot; and &quot;Exocet&quot; entered the British vernacular as a result of the war. The Falklands War also provided material for theatre, film and TV drama and influenced the output of musicians. In Argentina, the military government banned the broadcasting of music in the English language, giving way to the rise of local rock musicians, like the famous &quot;Trova Rosarina&quot; movement as well as solo musicians such as Charly García, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Fito Paez and Gustavo Santaolalla.

<text>The Fahrenheit scale () is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by the European physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686–1736). It uses the degree Fahrenheit (symbol: °F) as the unit. Several accounts of how he originally defined his scale exist, but the original paper suggests the lower defining point, 0 °F, was established as the freezing temperature of a solution of brine made from a mixture of water, ice, and ammonium chloride (a salt). The other limit established was his best estimate of the average human body temperature, originally set at 90 °F, then 96 °F (about 2.6 °F less than the modern value due to a later redefinition of the scale).

For much of the 20th century, the Fahrenheit scale was defined by two fixed points with a 180 °F separation: the temperature at which pure water freezes was defined as 32 °F and the boiling point of water was defined to be 212 °F, both at sea level and under standard atmospheric pressure. It is now formally defined using the Kelvin scale.

It continues to be used in the United States (including its unincorporated territories), its freely associated states in the Western Pacific (Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands), the Cayman Islands, and Liberia.

Fahrenheit is commonly still used alongside the Celsius scale in other countries that use the U.S. metrological service, such as Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, the Bahamas, and Belize. A handful of British Overseas Territories, including the Virgin Islands, Montserrat, Anguilla, and Bermuda, also still use both scales. All other countries now use Celsius (&quot;centigrade&quot; until 1948), which was invented 18 years after the Fahrenheit scale.

== Definition and conversion ==
Historically, on the Fahrenheit scale the freezing point of water was 32 °F, and the boiling point was 212 °F (at standard atmospheric pressure). This put the boiling and freezing points of water 180 degrees apart. Therefore, a degree on the Fahrenheit scale was of the interval between the freezing point and the boiling point. On the Celsius scale, the freezing and boiling points of water were originally defined to be 100 degrees apart. A temperature interval of 1 °F was equal to an interval of  degrees Celsius. With the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales now both defined by the kelvin, this relationship was preserved, a temperature interval of 1 °F being equal to an interval of  K and of  °C. The Fahrenheit and Celsius scales intersect numerically at −40 in the respective unit (i.e., −40 °F corresponds to −40 °C).

Absolute zero is 0 K, −273.15 °C, or −459.67 °F. The Rankine temperature scale uses degree intervals of the same size as those of the Fahrenheit scale, except that absolute zero is 0 °R the same way that the Kelvin temperature scale matches the Celsius scale, except that absolute zero is 0 K.

The combination of degree symbol (°) followed by an uppercase letter F is the conventional symbol for the Fahrenheit temperature scale. A number followed by this symbol (and separated from it with a space) denotes a specific temperature point (e.g., &quot;Gallium melts at 85.5763 °F&quot;). A difference between temperatures or an uncertainty in temperature is also conventionally written the same way as well, e.g., &quot;The output of the heat exchanger experiences an increase of 72 °F&quot; or &quot;Our standard uncertainty is ±5 °F&quot;. However, some authors instead use the notation &quot;An increase of &quot; (reversing the symbol order) to indicate temperature differences. Similar conventions exist for the Celsius scale, see .

=== Conversion (specific temperature point) ===
For an exact conversion between degrees Fahrenheit and Celsius, and kelvins of &quot;a specific temperature point&quot;, the following formulas can be applied. Here, is the value in degrees Fahrenheit, the value in degrees Celsius, and the value in kelvins:
*  °F to  °C: = 
*  °C to  °F: = × 1.8 + 32
*  °F to  K: = 
*  K to  °F: = × 1.8 − 459.67

There is also an exact conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales making use of the correspondence −40 °F ≘ −40 °C. Again, is the numeric value in degrees Fahrenheit, and the numeric value in degrees Celsius:
*  °F to  °C: = − 40
*  °C to  °F: = ( + 40) × 1.8 − 40

=== Conversion (temperature difference or interval) ===
When converting a &quot;temperature interval&quot; between the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales, only the ratio is used, without any constant (in this case, the interval has the same numeric value in kelvins as in degrees Celsius):
*  °F to  °C or  K: = = 
*  °C or  K to  °F: = × 1.8 = × 1.8

== History ==
Fahrenheit proposed his temperature scale in 1724, basing it on two reference points of temperature. In his initial scale (which is not the final Fahrenheit scale), the zero point was determined by placing the thermometer in &quot;a mixture of ice, water, and &quot;salis Armoniaci&quot; [transl. ammonium chloride] or even sea salt&quot;. This combination forms a eutectic system, which stabilizes its temperature automatically: 0 °F was defined to be that stable temperature. A second point, 96 degrees, was approximately the human body&#x27;s temperature. A third point, 32 degrees, was marked as being the temperature of ice and water &quot;without the aforementioned salts&quot;.

According to a German story, Fahrenheit actually chose the lowest air temperature measured in his hometown Danzig (Gdańsk, Poland) in winter 1708–09 as 0 °F, and only later had the need to be able to make this value reproducible using brine.

According to a letter Fahrenheit wrote to his friend Herman Boerhaave, his scale was built on the work of Ole Rømer, whom he had met earlier. In Rømer scale, brine freezes at zero, water freezes and melts at 7.5 degrees, body temperature is 22.5, and water boils at 60 degrees. Fahrenheit multiplied each value by 4 in order to eliminate fractions and make the scale more fine-grained. He then re-calibrated his scale using the melting point of ice and normal human body temperature (which were at 30 and 90 degrees); he adjusted the scale so that the melting point of ice would be 32 degrees, and body temperature 96 degrees, so that 64 intervals would separate the two, allowing him to mark degree lines on his instruments by simply bisecting the interval 6 times (since 64 = 26).

Fahrenheit soon after observed that water boils at about 212 degrees using this scale. The use of the freezing and boiling points of water as thermometer fixed reference points became popular following the work of Anders Celsius, and these fixed points were adopted by a committee of the Royal Society led by Henry Cavendish in 1776–77. Under this system, the Fahrenheit scale is redefined slightly so that the freezing point of water was exactly 32 °F, and the boiling point was exactly 212 °F, or 180 degrees higher. It is for this reason that normal human body temperature is approximately 98.6 °F (oral temperature) on the revised scale (whereas it was 90° on Fahrenheit&#x27;s multiplication of Rømer, and 96° on his original scale).

In the present-day Fahrenheit scale, 0 °F no longer corresponds to the eutectic temperature of ammonium chloride brine as described above. Instead, that eutectic is at approximately 4 °F on the final Fahrenheit scale.

The Rankine temperature scale was based upon the Fahrenheit temperature scale, with its zero representing absolute zero instead.

==Usage==

===General===
The Fahrenheit scale was the primary temperature standard for climatic, industrial and medical purposes in Anglophone countries until the 1960s. In the late 1960s and 1970s, the Celsius scale replaced Fahrenheit in almost all of those countries—with the notable exception of the United States.

Fahrenheit is used in the United States, its territories and associated states (all serviced by the U.S. National Weather Service), as well as the (British) Cayman Islands and Liberia for everyday applications. The Fahrenheit scale is in use in U.S. for all temperature measurements including weather forecasts, cooking, and food freezing temperatures, however for scientific research the scale is Celsius and Kelvin.
===United States===
Early in the 20th century, Halsey and Dale suggested that reasons for resistance to use the centigrade (now Celsius) system in the U.S. included the larger size of each degree Celsius and the lower zero point in the Fahrenheit system; the Fahrenheit scale is more intuitive than Celsius for describing outdoor temperatures in temperate latitudes, with 100 °F being a hot summer day and 0 °F a cold winter day.

===Canada===

Canada has passed legislation favoring the International System of Units, while also maintaining legal definitions for traditional Canadian imperial units. Canadian weather reports are conveyed using degrees Celsius with occasional reference to Fahrenheit especially for cross-border broadcasts. Fahrenheit is still used on virtually all Canadian ovens. Thermometers, both digital and analog, sold in Canada usually employ both the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales.

===European Union===
In the European Union, it is mandatory to use Kelvins or degrees Celsius when quoting temperature for &quot;economic, public health, public safety and administrative&quot; purposes, though degrees Fahrenheit may be used alongside degrees Celsius as a supplementary unit.

===United Kingdom===
Most British people use Celsius. However, the use of Fahrenheit still may appear at times alongside degrees Celsius in the print media with no standard convention for when the measurement is included.

For example, &quot;The Times&quot; has an all-metric daily weather page but includes a Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversion table. Some UK tabloids have adopted a tendency of using Fahrenheit for mid to high temperatures. It has been suggested that the rationale to keep using Fahrenheit was one of emphasis for high temperatures: &quot;−6 °C&quot; sounds colder than &quot;21 °F&quot;, and &quot;94 °F&quot; sounds more sensational than &quot;34 °C&quot;.

==Unicode representation of symbol==
Unicode provides the Fahrenheit symbol at code point . However, this is a compatibility character encoded for roundtrip compatibility with legacy encodings. The Unicode standard explicitly discourages the use of this character: &quot;The sequence + is preferred over , and those two sequences should be treated as identical for searching.&quot;

<doc id="11525" wikidata="Q2044" url="?curid=11525" title="Florence">
<text>Florence ( ; ) is the capital city of the Italian region of Tuscany. It is also the most populated city in Tuscany, with 364,073 inhabitants in 2024, and 990,527 in its metropolitan area.

Florence was a centre of medieval European trade and finance and one of the wealthiest cities of that era. It is considered by many academics to have been the birthplace of the Renaissance, becoming a major artistic, cultural, commercial, political, economic and financial center. During this time, Florence rose to a position of enormous influence in Italy, Europe, and beyond. Its turbulent political history includes periods of rule by the powerful Medici family and numerous religious and republican revolutions. From 1865 to 1871 the city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. The Florentine dialect forms the base of standard Italian and it became the language of culture throughout Italy due to the prestige of the masterpieces by Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, Giovanni Boccaccio, Niccolò Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini.

The city attracts millions of tourists each year, and UNESCO declared the Historic Centre of Florence a World Heritage Site in 1982. The city is noted for its culture, Renaissance art and architecture and monuments. The city also contains numerous museums and art galleries, such as the Uffizi Gallery and the Palazzo Pitti, and still exerts an influence in the fields of art, culture and politics. Due to Florence&#x27;s artistic and architectural heritage, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked it as one of the most beautiful cities in the world in 2010.

Florence plays an important role in Italian fashion, and is ranked in the top 15 fashion capitals of the world by Global Language Monitor; furthermore, it is a major national economic centre, as well as a tourist and industrial hub.

== Etymology ==
 comes from , locative form of , in turn a name conveying good luck, from .

== History ==


Florence originated as a Roman city, and later, after a long period as a flourishing trading and banking medieval commune, it was the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance. It was politically, economically, and culturally one of the most important cities in Europe and the world from the 14th to 16th centuries.

The language spoken in the city during the 14th century came to be accepted as the model for what would become the Italian language. Thanks especially to the works of the Tuscans Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio, the Florentine dialect, above all the local dialects, was adopted as the basis for a national literary language.

Starting from the late Middle Ages, Florentine money—in the form of the gold florin—financed the development of industry all over Europe, from Britain to Bruges, to Lyon and Hungary. Florentine bankers financed the English kings during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. They similarly financed the papacy, including the construction of their provisional capital of Avignon and, after their return to Rome, the reconstruction and Renaissance embellishment of Rome.

Florence was home to the Medici, one of European history&#x27;s most important noble families. Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici was considered a political and cultural mastermind of Italy in the late 15th century. Two members of the family were popes in the early 16th century: Leo X and Clement VII. Catherine de&#x27; Medici married King Henry II of France and, after his death in 1559, reigned as regent in France. Marie de&#x27; Medici married Henry IV of France and gave birth to the future King Louis XIII. The Medici reigned as Grand Dukes of Tuscany, starting with Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici in 1569 and ending with the death of Gian Gastone de&#x27; Medici in 1737.

The Kingdom of Italy, which was established in 1861, moved its capital from Turin to Florence in 1865, although the capital was moved to Rome in 1871.

=== Roman origins ===
Florence was established by the Romans in 59 BC as a colony for veteran soldiers and was built in the style of an army camp. Situated along the &quot;Via Cassia&quot;, the main route between Rome and the north, and within the fertile valley of the Arno, the settlement quickly became an important commercial centre and in AD 285 became the capital of the Tuscia region.

=== Early Middle Ages ===
In centuries to come, the city experienced turbulent alternate periods of Ostrogoth and Byzantine rule, during which the city was fought over, helping to cause the population to fall to as low as 1,000 people. Peace returned under Lombard rule in the 6th century and Florence was in turn conquered by Charlemagne in 774 becoming part of the March of Tuscany centred on Lucca. The population began to grow again and commerce prospered.

=== Second millennium ===

Margrave Hugo chose Florence as his residency instead of Lucca around 1000 AD. The Golden Age of Florentine art began around this time. In 1100, Florence was a &quot;commune&quot;, meaning a city-state. The city&#x27;s primary resource was the Arno river, providing power and access for the industry (mainly textile industry), and access to the Mediterranean sea for international trade, helping the growth of an industrious merchant community. The Florentine merchant banking skills became recognised in Europe after they brought decisive financial innovation (e.g. bills of exchange, double-entry bookkeeping system) to medieval fairs. This period also saw the eclipse of Florence&#x27;s formerly powerful rival Pisa. The growing power of the merchant elite culminated in an anti-aristocratic uprising, led by Giano della Bella, resulting in the Ordinances of Justice which entrenched the power of the elite guilds until the end of the Republic.

=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
==== Rise of the Medici ====
At the height of demographic expansion around 1325, the urban population may have been as great as 120,000, and the rural population around the city was probably close to 300,000. The Black Death of 1348 reduced it by over half. About 25,000 are said to have been supported by the city&#x27;s wool industry: in 1345 Florence was the scene of an attempted strike by wool combers (&quot;ciompi&quot;), who in 1378 rose up in a brief revolt against oligarchic rule in the Revolt of the Ciompi. After their suppression, Florence came under the sway (1382–1434) of the Albizzi family, who became bitter rivals of the Medici.

In the 15th century, Florence was among the largest cities in Europe, with a population of 60,000, and was considered rich and economically successful. Cosimo de&#x27; Medici was the first Medici family member to essentially control the city from behind the scenes. Although the city was technically a democracy of sorts, his power came from a vast patronage network along with his alliance to the new immigrants, the &quot;gente nuova&quot; (new people). The fact that the Medici were bankers to the pope also contributed to their ascendancy. Cosimo was succeeded by his son Piero, who was, soon after, succeeded by Cosimo&#x27;s grandson, Lorenzo in 1469. Lorenzo was a great patron of the arts, commissioning works by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and Botticelli. Lorenzo was an accomplished poet and musician and brought composers and singers to Florence, including Alexander Agricola, Johannes Ghiselin, and Heinrich Isaac. By contemporary Florentines (and since), he was known as &quot;Lorenzo the Magnificent&quot; (Lorenzo il Magnifico).

Following Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s death in 1492, he was succeeded by his son Piero II. When the French king Charles VIII invaded northern Italy, Piero II chose to resist his army. But when he realised the size of the French army at the gates of Pisa, he had to accept the humiliating conditions of the French king. These made the Florentines rebel, and they expelled Piero II. With his exile in 1494, the first period of Medici rule ended with the restoration of a republican government.

==== Savonarola, Machiavelli, and the Medici popes ====
During this period, the Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola had become prior of the San Marco monastery in 1490. He was famed for his penitential sermons, lambasting what he viewed as widespread immorality and attachment to material riches. He praised the exile of the Medici as the work of God, punishing them for their decadence. He seized the opportunity to carry through political reforms leading to a more democratic rule. But when Savonarola publicly accused Pope Alexander VI of corruption, he was banned from speaking in public. When he broke this ban, he was excommunicated. The Florentines, tired of his teachings, turned against him and arrested him. He was convicted as a heretic, hanged and burned on the Piazza della Signoria on 23 May 1498. His ashes were dispersed in the Arno river.

Another Florentine of this period was Niccolò Machiavelli, whose prescriptions for Florence&#x27;s regeneration under strong leadership have often been seen as a legitimization of political expediency and even malpractice. Machiavelli was a political thinker, renowned for his political handbook &quot;The Prince&quot;, which is about ruling and exercising power. Commissioned by the Medici, Machiavelli also wrote the &quot;Florentine Histories&quot;, the history of the city.

In 1512, the Medici retook control of Florence with the help of Spanish and Papal troops. They were led by two cousins, Giovanni and Giulio de&#x27; Medici, both of whom would later become Popes of the Catholic Church, (Leo X and Clement VII, respectively). Both were generous patrons of the arts, commissioning works like Michelangelo&#x27;s Laurentian Library and Medici Chapel in Florence, to name just two. Their reigns coincided with political upheaval in Italy, and thus in 1527, Florentines drove out the Medici for a second time and re-established a theocratic republic on 16 May 1527, (Jesus Christ was named King of Florence). The Medici returned to power in Florence in 1530, with the armies of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and the blessings of Pope Clement VII (Giulio de&#x27; Medici).

Florence officially became a monarchy in 1531, when Emperor Charles and Pope Clement named Alessandro de&#x27; Medici as &quot;Duke of the Florentine Republic&quot;. The Medici&#x27;s monarchy would last over two centuries. Alessandro&#x27;s successor, Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, was named Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1569; in all Tuscany, only the Republic of Lucca (later a Duchy) and the Principality of Piombino were independent from Florence.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===

The extinction of the Medici dynasty and the accession in 1737 of Francis Stephen, duke of Lorraine and husband of Maria Theresa of Austria, led to Tuscany&#x27;s temporary inclusion in the territories of the Austrian crown. It became a secundogeniture of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, who were deposed for the House of Bourbon-Parma in 1801. From 1801 to 1807 Florence was the capital of the Napoleonic client state Kingdom of Etruria. The Bourbon-Parma were deposed in December 1807 when Tuscany was annexed by France. Florence was the prefecture of the French département of Arno from 1808 to the fall of Napoleon in 1814. The Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty was restored on the throne of Tuscany at the Congress of Vienna but finally deposed in 1859. Tuscany became a region of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861.

Florence replaced Turin as Italy&#x27;s capital in 1865 and, in an effort to modernise the city, the old market in the Piazza del Mercato Vecchio and many medieval houses were pulled down and replaced by a more formal street plan with newer houses. The Piazza (first renamed Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II, then Piazza della Repubblica, the present name) was significantly widened and a large triumphal arch was constructed at the west end. A museum recording the destruction stands nearby today.

The country&#x27;s second capital city was superseded by Rome six years later, after the withdrawal of the French troops allowed the capture of Rome.

=== 20th century ===

During World War II the city experienced a year-long German occupation (1943–1944) being part of the Italian Social Republic. Hitler declared it an open city on 3 July 1944 as troops of the British 8th Army closed in. Except for the Ponte Vecchio, in early August, the retreating Germans decided to demolish all the bridges along the Arno linking the district of Oltrarno to the rest of the city, making it difficult for troops of the 8th Army to cross.
Florence was liberated by New Zealand, South African and British troops on 4 August 1944 alongside partisans from the Tuscan Committee of National Liberation (CTLN). The Allied soldiers who died driving the Germans from Tuscany are buried in cemeteries outside the city (Americans about south of the city, British and Commonwealth soldiers a few kilometres east of the centre on the right bank of the Arno).

At the end of World War II in May 1945, the US Army&#x27;s Information and Educational Branch was ordered to establish an overseas university campus for demobilised American service men and women in Florence. The first American university for service personnel was established in June 1945 at the School of Aeronautics. Some 7,500 soldier-students were to pass through the university during its four one-month sessions (see G. I. American Universities).

In November 1966, the Arno flooded parts of the centre, damaging many art treasures. Around the city there are tiny placards on the walls noting where the flood waters reached at their highest point.

== Geography ==

Florence lies in a basin formed by the hills of Careggi, Fiesole, Settignano, Arcetri, Poggio Imperiale and Bellosguardo (Florence). The Arno river, three other minor rivers (Mugnone, Ema and Greve) and some streams flow through it.

=== Climate ===
Florence has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;), tending to Mediterranean (&quot;Csa&quot;). It has hot summers with moderate or light rainfall and cool, damp winters. As Florence lacks a prevailing wind, summer temperatures are higher than along the coast. Rainfall in summer is convectional, while relief rainfall dominates in the winter. Snow is rare. The highest officially recorded temperature was on 26 July 1983 and the lowest was on 12 January 1985.


== Demographics ==
In 1200 the city was home to 50,000 people. By 1300 the population of the city proper was 120,000, with an additional 300,000 living in the Contado. Between 1500 and 1650 the population was around 70,000.

, the population of the city proper is 370,702, while Eurostat estimates that 696,767 people live in the urban area of Florence. The Metropolitan Area of Florence, Prato and Pistoia, constituted in 2000 over an area of roughly , is home to 1.5 million people. Within Florence proper, 46.8% of the population was male in 2007 and 53.2% were female. Minors (children aged 18 and less) totalled 14.10% of the population compared to pensioners, who numbered 25.95 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of Florence resident is 49 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Florence grew by 3.22 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent. The birth rate of Florence is 7.66 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.

, 87.46% of the population was Italian. An estimated 6,000 Chinese live in the city. The largest immigrant group came from other European countries (mostly Romanians and Albanians): 3.52%, East Asia (mostly Chinese and Filipino): 2.17%, the Americas: 1.41%, and North Africa (mostly Moroccan): 0.9%.

Much like the rest of Italy most of the people in Florence are Roman Catholic, with more than 90% of the population belonging to the Archdiocese of Florence.

As of 2016, an estimated 30,000 people, or 8% of the population, identified as Muslim.

== Economy ==
Tourism is, by far, the most important of all industries and most of the Florentine economy relies on the money generated by international arrivals and students studying in the city. The value tourism to the city totalled some €2.5 billion in 2015 and the number of visitors had increased by 5.5% from the previous year.

In 2013, Florence was listed as the second best world city by &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot;.

Manufacturing and commerce remain highly important. Florence is Italy&#x27;s 17th richest city in terms of average workers&#x27; earnings, with the figure being €23,265 (the overall city&#x27;s income is €6,531,204,473), coming after Mantua, yet surpassing Bolzano.

=== Industry, commerce and services ===
Florence is a major production and commercial centre in Italy, where the Florentine industrial complexes in the suburbs produce all sorts of goods, from furniture, rubber goods, chemicals, and food. Traditional and local products, such as antiques, handicrafts, glassware, leatherwork, art reproductions, jewellery, souvenirs, elaborate metal and iron-work, shoes, accessories and high fashion clothes also occupy a fair sector of Florence&#x27;s economy. The city&#x27;s income relies partially on services and commercial and cultural interests, such as annual fairs, theatrical and lyrical productions, art exhibitions, festivals and fashion shows, such as the Calcio Fiorentino. Heavy industry and machinery also take their part in providing an income. In Nuovo Pignone, numerous factories are still present, and small-to medium industrial businesses are dominant. The Florence-Prato-Pistoia industrial districts and areas were known as the &#x27;Third Italy&#x27; in the 1990s, due to the exports of high-quality goods and automobile (especially the Vespa) and the prosperity and productivity of the Florentine entrepreneurs. Some of these industries even rivalled the traditional industrial districts in Emilia-Romagna and Veneto due to high profits and productivity.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, manufacturing increased by 2.4% and exports increased by 7.2%. Leading sectors included mechanical engineering, fashion, pharmaceutics, food and wine. During 2015, permanent employment contracts increased by 48.8 percent, boosted by nationwide tax break.

=== Tourism ===

Tourism is the most significant industry in central Florence. From April to October, tourists outnumber the local population. Tickets to the Uffizi and Accademia galleries are regularly sold out and large groups regularly fill the basilicas of Santa Croce and Santa Maria Novella, both of which charge for entry. Tickets for The Uffizi and Accademia can be purchased online prior to visiting. In 2010, readers of &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; magazine ranked the city as their third favourite tourist destination. In 2015, Condé Nast Travel readers voted Florence as the best city in Europe.

Studies by Euromonitor International have concluded that cultural and history-oriented tourism is generating significantly increased spending throughout Europe.

Florence is believed to have the greatest concentration of art (in proportion to its size) in the world. Thus, cultural tourism is particularly strong, with world-renowned museums such as the Uffizi selling over 1.93 million tickets in 2014. The city&#x27;s convention centre facilities were restructured during the 1990s and host exhibitions, conferences, meetings, social forums, concerts and other events.

In 2016, Florence had 20,588 hotel rooms in 570 facilities. International visitors use 75% of the rooms; some 18% of those were from the U.S. In 2014, the city had 8.5 million overnight stays. A Euromonitor report indicates that in 2015 the city ranked as the world&#x27;s 36th most visited in the world, with over 4.95 million arrivals for the year.

Tourism brings revenue to Florence, but also creates certain problems. The Ponte Vecchio, The San Lorenzo Market and Santa Maria Novella are plagued by pickpockets. The province of Florence receives roughly 13 million visitors per year and in peak seasons, popular locations may become overcrowded as a result. In 2015, Mayor Dario Nardella expressed concern over visitors who arrive on buses, stay only a few hours, spend little money but contribute significantly to overcrowding. &quot;No museum visit, just a photo from the square, the bus back and then on to Venice ... We don&#x27;t want tourists like that&quot;, he said.

Some tourists are less than respectful of the city&#x27;s cultural heritage, according to Nardella. In June 2017, he instituted a programme of spraying church steps with water to prevent tourists from using such areas as picnic spots. While he values the benefits of tourism, he claims that there has been &quot;an increase among those who sit down on church steps, eat their food and leave rubbish strewn on them&quot;, he explained. To boost the sale of traditional foods, the mayor had introduced legislation (enacted in 2016) that requires restaurants to use typical Tuscan products and rejected McDonald&#x27;s application to open a location in the Piazza del Duomo.

In October 2021, Florence was shortlisted for the European Commission&#x27;s 2022 European Capital of Smart Tourism award along with Bordeaux, Copenhagen, Dublin, Ljubljana, Palma de Mallorca and Valencia.

=== Food and wine production ===

Food and wine have long been an important staple of the economy. The Chianti region is just south of the city, and its Sangiovese grapes figure prominently not only in its Chianti Classico wines but also in many of the more recently developed Supertuscan blends. Within to the west is the Carmignano area, also home to flavourful sangiovese-based reds. The celebrated Chianti Rufina district, geographically and historically separated from the main Chianti region, is also few kilometres east of Florence. More recently, the Bolgheri region (about southwest of Florence) has become celebrated for its &quot;Super Tuscan&quot; reds such as Sassicaia and Ornellaia.

== Government ==

The legislative body of the municipality is the City Council (&quot;Consiglio Comunale&quot;), which is composed of 36 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, at the same time as the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Committee (&quot;Giunta Comunale&quot;), composed of 7 assessors, nominated and presided over by a directly elected Mayor. The current mayor of Florence is Sara Funaro.

The municipality of Florence is subdivided into five administrative Boroughs (&quot;Quartieri&quot;). Each borough is governed by a Council (&quot;Consiglio&quot;) and a President, elected at the same time as the city mayor. The urban organisation is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114). The boroughs have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics (environment, construction, public health, local markets) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous funding in order to finance local activities. The boroughs are:
* Q1 – Centro storico (Historic Centre); population: 67,170;
* Q2 – Campo di Marte; population: 88,588;
* Q3 – Gavinana-Galluzzo; population: 40,907;
* Q4 – Isolotto-Legnaia; population: 66,636;
* Q5 – Rifredi; population: 103,761.

All of the five boroughs are governed by the Democratic Party.

The former Italian Prime Minister (2014–2016), Matteo Renzi, served as mayor from 2009 to 2014.

== Culture ==
=== Art ===

Florence was the birthplace of High Renaissance art, which lasted from about 1500 to 1527. Renaissance art put a larger emphasis on naturalism and human emotion. Medieval art was often formulaic and symbolic; the surviving works are mostly religious, their subjects were chosen by clerics. By contrast, Renaissance art became more rational, mathematical, individualistic, and was produced by known artists such as Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael, who started to sign their works. Religion was important, but with this new age came the humanization of religious figures in art, such as in Masaccio&#x27;s &quot;Expulsion from the Garden of Eden&quot; and Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Madonna della Seggiola&quot;; people of this age began to understand themselves as human beings, which reflected in art. The Renaissance marked the rebirth of classical values in art and society as people studied the ancient masters of the Greco-Roman world; art became focused on realism as opposed to idealism.

Cimabue and Giotto, the fathers of Italian painting, lived in Florence, as did Arnolfo di Cambio and Andrea Pisano, renewers of architecture and sculpture; Filippo Brunelleschi, Donatello and Masaccio, forefathers of the Renaissance, Lorenzo Ghiberti and the Della Robbia family, Filippo Lippi and Fra Angelico; Sandro Botticelli, Paolo Uccello and the universal genius of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo.

Their works, together with those of many other generations of artists, are gathered in the city&#x27;s many museums: the Uffizi Gallery, the Galleria Palatina with the paintings of the &quot;Golden Ages&quot;, the Bargello with the sculptures of the Renaissance, the museum of San Marco with Fra Angelico&#x27;s works, the Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia, the Medici Chapels, the museum of Orsanmichele, the Casa Buonarroti with sculptures by Michelangelo, the Museo Bardini, the Museo Horne, the Museo Stibbert, the Palazzo Corsini, the Galleria d&#x27;Arte Moderna, the Museo dell&#x27;Opera del Duomo, the Tesoro dei Granduchi and the Museo dell&#x27;Opificio delle Pietre Dure. Several monuments are located in Florence: the Baptistery with its mosaics; the cathedral with its sculptures, the medieval churches with bands of frescoes; public as well as private palaces – the Palazzo Vecchio, the Palazzo Pitti, the Palazzo Medici Riccardi, the Palazzo Davanzati and the Casa Martelli; monasteries, cloisters, refectories; the Certosa. The Museo Archeologico Nazionale documents Etruscan civilization. The city is so rich in art that some visitors experience Stendhal syndrome as they encounter its art for the first time.
Florentine architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1466) and Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) were among the fathers of Renaissance architecture. The cathedral, topped by Brunelleschi&#x27;s dome, dominates the Florentine skyline. The Florentines decided to start building it late in the 13th century, without a design for the dome. The project proposed by Brunelleschi in the 14th century was the largest ever built at the time, and the first major dome built in Europe since the two great domes of Roman times – the Pantheon in Rome, and Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. The dome of Santa Maria del Fiore remains the largest brick construction of its kind in the world. In front of it is the medieval Baptistery. The two buildings incorporate in their decoration the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. In recent years, most of the important works of art from the two buildings – and from the nearby Giotto&#x27;s Campanile, have been removed and replaced by copies. The originals are now housed in the Museo dell&#x27;Opera del Duomo, just to the east of the cathedral.

Florence has a large number of art-filled churches, such as San Miniato al Monte, San Lorenzo, Santa Maria Novella, Santa Trinita, Santa Maria del Carmine, Santa Croce, Santo Spirito, Santissima Annunziata, Ognissanti and numerous others.

Artists associated with Florence range from Arnolfo di Cambio and Cimabue to Giotto, Nanni di Banco, and Paolo Uccello; through Lorenzo Ghiberti, and Donatello and Masaccio and the della Robbia family; through Fra Angelico and Sandro Botticelli and Piero della Francesca, and on to Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. Others include Benvenuto Cellini, Andrea del Sarto, Benozzo Gozzoli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Filippo Lippi, Bernardo Buontalenti, Orcagna, Antonio and Piero del Pollaiuolo, Filippino Lippi, Andrea del Verrocchio, Bronzino, Desiderio da Settignano, Michelozzo, Cosimo Rosselli, the Sangallos, and Pontormo. Artists from other regions who worked in Florence include Raphael, Andrea Pisano, Giambologna, Il Sodoma and Peter Paul Rubens.

Picture galleries in Florence include the Uffizi and the Palazzo Pitti. Two superb collections of sculpture are in the Bargello and the Museo dell&#x27;Opera del Duomo. They are filled with the creations of Donatello, Verrocchio, Desiderio da Settignano, Michelangelo and others. The Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia has Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot;, which was created between 1501 and 1504 and is perhaps the best-known work of art anywhere, plus the unfinished statues of slaves Michelangelo created for the tomb of Pope Julius II. Other sights include the medieval city hall, the Palazzo della Signoria (also known as the Palazzo Vecchio), the National Archeological Museum, the Museo Galileo, the Palazzo Davanzati, the Museo Stibbert, the Museo Nazionale di San Marco, the Medici Chapels, the Museo dell&#x27;Opera di Santa Croce, the Museum of the Cloister of Santa Maria Novella, the Zoological Museum (&quot;La Specola&quot;), the Museo Bardini, and the Museo Horne. There is also a collection of works by the modern sculptor, Marino Marini, in a museum named after him. The Palazzo Strozzi is the site of special exhibitions.

=== Language ===

Florentine (&quot;fiorentino&quot;), spoken by inhabitants of Florence and its environs, is a Tuscan dialect and the immediate parent language to modern Italian.

Although its vocabulary and pronunciation are largely identical to standard Italian, differences do exist. The &quot;Vocabolario del fiorentino contemporaneo&quot; (Dictionary of Modern Florentine) reveals lexical distinctions from all walks of life.

Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio pioneered the use of the vernacular instead of the Latin used for most literary works at the time.

=== Literature ===

Despite Latin being the main language of the courts and the Church in the Middle Ages, writers such as Dante Alighieri and many others used their own language, the Florentine vernacular descended from Latin, in composing their greatest works. The oldest literary pieces written in Florentine go as far back as the 13th century. Florence&#x27;s literature fully blossomed in the 14th century, when not only Dante with his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (1306–1321) and Petrarch, but also poets such as Guido Cavalcanti and Lapo Gianni composed their most important works. Dante&#x27;s masterpiece is the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, which mainly deals with the poet himself taking an allegoric and moral tour of Hell, Purgatory and finally Heaven, during which he meets numerous mythological or real characters of his age or before. He is first guided by the Roman poet Virgil, whose non-Christian beliefs damned him to Hell. Later on he is joined by Beatrice, who guides him through Heaven.

In the 14th century, Petrarch and Giovanni Boccaccio led the literary scene in Florence after Dante&#x27;s death in 1321. Petrarch was an all-rounder writer, author and poet, but was particularly known for his &quot;Canzoniere&quot;, or the Book of Songs, where he conveyed his unremitting love for Laura. His style of writing has since become known as &quot;Petrarchism&quot;. Boccaccio was better known for his &quot;Decameron&quot;, a slightly grim story of Florence during the 1350s bubonic plague, known as the Black Death, when some people fled the ravaged city to an isolated country mansion, and spent their time there recounting stories and novellas taken from the medieval and contemporary tradition. All of this is written in a series of 100 distinct novellas.

In the 16th century, during the Renaissance, Florence was the home town of political writer and philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli, whose ideas on how rulers should govern the land, detailed in &quot;The Prince&quot;, spread across European courts and enjoyed enduring popularity for centuries. These principles became known as &quot;Machiavellianism&quot;.

=== Music ===

Florence became a musical centre during the Middle Ages and music and the performing arts remain an important part of its culture. The growth of Northern Italian Cities in the 1500s likely contributed to its increased prominence. During the Renaissance, there were four kinds of musical patronage in the city with respect to both sacred and secular music: state, corporate, church, and private. It was here that the Florentine Camerata convened in the mid-16th century and experimented with setting tales of Greek mythology to music and staging the result—in other words, the first operas, setting the wheels in motion not just for the further development of the operatic form, but for later developments of separate &quot;classical&quot; forms such as the symphony and concerto. After the year 1600, Italian trends prevailed across Europe, by 1750 it was the primary musical language. The genre of the Madrigal, born in Italy, gained popularity in Britain and elsewhere. Several Italian cities were &quot;larger on the musical map than their real-size for power suggested. Florence, was once such city which experienced a fantastic period in the early seventeenth Century of musico-theatrical innovation, including the beginning and flourishing of opera.

Opera was invented in Florence in the late 16th century when Jacopo Peri&#x27;s &quot;Dafne&quot; an opera in the style of monody, was premiered. Opera spread from Florence throughout Italy and eventually Europe. Vocal Music in the choir setting was also taking new identity at this time. At the beginning of the 17th century, two practices for writing music were devised, one the first practice or &quot;Stile Antico/Prima Prattica&quot; the other the &quot;Stile Moderno/Seconda Prattica&quot;. The Stile Antico was more prevalent in Northern Europe and Stile Moderno was practiced more by the Italian Composers of the time. The piano was invented in Florence in 1709 by Bartolomeo Cristofori. Composers and musicians who have lived in Florence include Piero Strozzi (1550 – after 1608), Giulio Caccini (1551–1618) and Mike Francis (1961–2009). Giulio Caccini&#x27;s book &quot;Le Nuove Musiche&quot; was significant in performance practice technique instruction at the time. The book specified a new term, in use by the 1630s, called monody which indicated the combination of voice and basso continuo and connoted a practice of stating text in a free, lyrical, yet speech-like manner. This would occur while an instrument, usually a keyboard type such as harpsichord, played and held chords while the singer sang/spoke the monodic line.

=== Cinema ===
Florence has been a setting for numerous works of fiction and movies, including the novels and associated films, such as &quot;Light in the Piazza&quot;, &quot;The Girl Who Couldn&#x27;t Say No&quot;, &quot;Calmi Cuori Appassionati&quot;, &quot;Hannibal&quot;, &quot;A Room with a View&quot;, &quot;Tea with Mussolini&quot;, &quot;Virgin Territory&quot; and &quot;Inferno&quot;. The city is home to renowned Italian actors and actresses, such as Roberto Benigni, Leonardo Pieraccioni and Vittoria Puccini.

=== Video games ===
Florence has appeared as a location in video games such as &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed II&quot;. The Republic of Florence also appears as a playable nation in Paradox Interactive&#x27;s grand strategy game &quot;Europa Universalis IV&quot;.

=== Other media ===
16th century Florence is the setting of the Japanese manga and anime series &quot;Arte&quot;.

=== Cuisine ===

Florentine food grows out of a tradition of peasant fare rather than rarefied high cuisine. The majority of dishes are based on meat. The whole animal was traditionally eaten; tripe (&quot;trippa&quot;) and stomach (&quot;lampredotto&quot;) were once regularly on the menu at restaurants and still are sold at the food carts stationed throughout the city. Antipasti include &quot;crostini toscani&quot;, sliced bread rounds topped with a chicken liver-based pâté, and sliced meats (mainly prosciutto and salame, often served with melon when in season). The typically saltless Tuscan bread, obtained with natural levain frequently features in Florentine courses, especially in its soups, &quot;ribollita&quot; and &quot;pappa al pomodoro&quot;, or in the salad of bread and fresh vegetables called &quot;panzanella&quot; that is served in summer. The &quot;bistecca alla fiorentina&quot; is a large (the customary size should weigh around ) – the &quot;date&quot; steak – T-bone steak of Chianina beef cooked over hot charcoal and served very rare with its more recently derived version, the &quot;tagliata&quot;, sliced rare beef served on a bed of arugula, often with slices of Parmesan cheese on top. Most of these courses are generally served with local olive oil, also a prime product enjoying a worldwide reputation.Among the desserts, &quot;schiacciata alla fiorentina&quot;, a white flatbread cake, is one of the most popular; it is a very soft cake, prepared with extremely simple ingredients, typical of Florentine cuisine, and is especially eaten at Carnival.

=== Research activity ===

Research institutes and university departments are located within the Florence area and within two campuses at Polo di Novoli and Polo Scientifico di Sesto Fiorentino as well as in the Research Area of Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche.

=== Science and discovery ===

Florence has been an important scientific centre for centuries, notably during the Renaissance with scientists such as Leonardo da Vinci.

Florentines were one of the driving forces behind the Age of Discovery. Florentine bankers financed Henry the Navigator and the Portuguese explorers who pioneered the route around Africa to India and the Far East. It was a map drawn by the Florentine Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli, a student of Brunelleschi, that Christopher Columbus used to sell his &quot;enterprise&quot; to the Spanish monarchs, and which he used on his first voyage. Mercator&#x27;s &quot;Projection&quot; is a refined version of Toscanelli&#x27;s, taking the Americas into account.

Galileo and other scientists pioneered the study of optics, ballistics, astronomy, anatomy, and other scientific disciplines. Pico della Mirandola, Leonardo Bruni, Machiavelli, and many others laid the groundwork for modern scientific understanding.

=== Fashion ===


By the year 1300 Florence had become a centre of textile production in Europe. Many of the rich families in Renaissance Florence were major purchasers of locally produced fine clothing, and the specialists of fashion in the economy and culture of Florence during that period is often underestimated. Florence is regarded by some as the birthplace and earliest centre of the modern (post World War Two) fashion industry in Italy. The Florentine &quot;soirées&quot; of the early 1950s organised by Giovanni Battista Giorgini were events where several Italian designers participated in group shows and first garnered international attention. Florence has served as the home of the Italian fashion company Salvatore Ferragamo since 1928. Gucci, Roberto Cavalli, and Emilio Pucci are also headquartered in Florence.

=== Historical evocations ===
==== &quot;Scoppio del Carro&quot; ====
The &quot;Scoppio del Carro&quot; (&quot;Explosion of the Cart&quot;) is a celebration of the First Crusade. During the day of Easter, a cart, which the Florentines call the &quot;Brindellone&quot; and which is led by four white oxen, is taken to the Piazza del Duomo between the Baptistery of St. John the Baptist (&quot;Battistero di San Giovanni&quot;) and the Florence Cathedral (&quot;Santa Maria del Fiore&quot;). The cart is connected by a rope to the interior of the church. Near the cart there is a model of a dove, which, according to legend, is a symbol of good luck for the city: at the end of the Easter mass, the dove emerges from the nave of the Duomo and ignites the fireworks on the cart.

==== &quot;Calcio Storico&quot; ====

&quot;Calcio Storico Fiorentino&quot; (&quot;Historic Florentine Football&quot;), sometimes called &quot;Calcio in costume&quot;, is a traditional sport, regarded as a forerunner of soccer, though the actual gameplay most closely resembles rugby. The event originates from the Middle Ages, when the most important Florentine nobles amused themselves playing while wearing bright costumes. The most important match was played on 17 February 1530, during the siege of Florence. That day Papal troops besieged the city while the Florentines, with contempt of the enemies, decided to play the game notwithstanding the situation. The game is played in the Piazza di Santa Croce. A temporary arena is constructed, with bleachers and a sand-covered playing field. A series of matches are held between four teams representing each (quarter) of Florence during late June and early July. There are four teams: Azzurri (light blue), Bianchi (white), Rossi (red) and Verdi (green). The Azzurri are from the quarter of Santa Croce, Bianchi from the quarter of Santo Spirito, Verdi are from San Giovanni and Rossi from Santa Maria Novella.

== Main sights ==
Florence is known as the &quot;Cradle of the Renaissance&quot; (&quot;la culla del Rinascimento&quot;) for its monuments, churches, and buildings. The best-known site of Florence is the domed cathedral of the city, Santa Maria del Fiore, known as &quot;The Duomo&quot;, whose dome was built by Filippo Brunelleschi. The nearby Campanile (partly designed by Giotto) and the Baptistery buildings are also highlights. The dome, 600 years after its completion, is still the largest dome built in brick and mortar in the world. In 1982, the historic centre of Florence (Italian: &quot;centro storico di Firenze&quot;) was declared a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. The centre of the city is contained in medieval walls that were built in the 14th century to defend the city. At the heart of the city, in Piazza della Signoria, is Bartolomeo Ammannati&#x27;s Fountain of Neptune (1563–1565), which is a masterpiece of marble sculpture at the terminus of a still functioning Roman aqueduct.

The layout and structure of Florence in many ways harkens back to the Roman era, where it was designed as a garrison settlement. Nevertheless, the majority of the city was built during the Renaissance. Despite the strong presence of Renaissance architecture within the city, traces of medieval, Baroque, Neoclassical and modern architecture can be found. The as well as the Duomo, or the city&#x27;s Cathedral, are the two buildings which dominate Florence&#x27;s skyline.

The river (Arno), which cuts through the old part of the city, is as much a character in Florentine history as many of the people who lived there. Historically, the locals have had a love-hate relationship with the Arno – which alternated between nourishing the city with commerce, and destroying it by flood.

One of the bridges in particular stands out – the Ponte Vecchio (&#x27;Old Bridge&#x27;), whose most striking feature is the multitude of shops built upon its edges, held up by stilts. The bridge also carries Vasari&#x27;s elevated corridor linking the Uffizi to the Medici residence (Palazzo Pitti). Although the original bridge was constructed by the Etruscans, the current bridge was rebuilt in the 14th century. It is the only bridge in the city to have survived World War II intact. It is the first example in the western world of a bridge built using segmental arches, that is, arches less than a semicircle, to reduce both span-to-rise ratio and the numbers of pillars to allow lesser encumbrance in the riverbed (being in this much more successful than the Roman Alconétar Bridge).

The church of San Lorenzo contains the Medici Chapels, a complex of burial chapels of the Medici family—the most powerful family in Florence from the 15th to the 18th centuries.

The Uffizi Gallery, one of the finest art museums in the world, was founded on a large bequest from the last member of the Medici family. It is located at the corner of Piazza della Signoria, a site important for being the centre of Florence&#x27;s civil life and government for centuries. The Palazzo della Signoria facing it is still home of the municipal government. Many significant episodes in the history of art and political changes were staged here, such as:

* In 1301, Dante Alighieri was sent into exile from here (commemorated by a plaque on one of the walls of the Uffizi).
* On 26 April 1478, Jacopo de&#x27; Pazzi and his retainers tried to raise the city against the Medici after the plot known as &quot;La congiura dei Pazzi&quot; (&quot;The Pazzi conspiracy&quot;), murdering Giuliano di Piero de&#x27; Medici and wounding his brother Lorenzo. All the members of the plot who could be apprehended were seized by the Florentines and hanged from the windows of the palace.
* In 1497, it was the location of the Bonfire of the vanities instigated by the Dominican friar and preacher Girolamo Savonarola.
* On 23 May 1498, the same Savonarola and two followers were hanged and burnt at the stake. (A round plate in the ground marks the spot where he was hanged)
* In 1504, Michelangelo&#x27;s David (now replaced by a replica, since the original was moved in 1873 to the Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia) was installed in front of the Palazzo della Signoria (also known as ).

The Loggia dei Lanzi in Piazza della Signoria is the location of a number of statues by other sculptors such as Donatello, Giambologna, Bartolomeo Ammannati and Benvenuto Cellini, although some have been replaced with copies to preserve the originals.


=== Monuments, museums and religious buildings ===


Florence contains several palaces and buildings from various eras. The is the town hall of Florence and also an art museum. This large Romanesque crenellated fortress-palace overlooks the Piazza della Signoria with its copy of Michelangelo&#x27;s David statue as well as the gallery of statues in the adjacent Loggia dei Lanzi. Originally called the &quot;Palazzo della Signoria&quot;, after the Signoria of Florence, the ruling body of the Republic of Florence, it was also given several other names: &quot;Palazzo del Popolo&quot;, &quot;Palazzo dei Priori&quot;, and &quot;Palazzo Ducale&quot;, in accordance with the varying use of the palace during its long history. The building acquired its current name when the Medici duke&#x27;s residence was moved across the Arno to the Palazzo Pitti. It is linked to the Uffizi and the Palazzo Pitti through the Corridoio Vasariano.

Palazzo Medici Riccardi, designed by Michelozzo di Bartolomeo for Cosimo il Vecchio, of the Medici family, is another major edifice, and was built between 1445 and 1460. It was well known for its stone masonry that includes rustication and ashlar. Today it is the head office of the Metropolitan City of Florence and hosts museums and the Riccardiana Library. The Palazzo Strozzi, an example of civil architecture with its rusticated stone, was inspired by the Palazzo Medici, but with more harmonious proportions. Today the palace is used for international expositions like the annual antique show (founded as the Biennale dell&#x27;Antiquariato in 1959), fashion shows and other cultural and artistic events. Here also is the seat of the Istituto Nazionale del Rinascimento and the noted Gabinetto Vieusseux, with the library and reading room.

<text>A quotient group or factor group is a mathematical group obtained by aggregating similar elements of a larger group using an equivalence relation that preserves some of the group structure (the rest of the structure is &quot;factored out&quot;). For example, the cyclic group of addition modulo &quot;n&quot; can be obtained from the group of integers under addition by identifying elements that differ by a multiple of formula_1 and defining a group structure that operates on each such class (known as a congruence class) as a single entity. It is part of the mathematical field known as group theory.

For a congruence relation on a group, the equivalence class of the identity element is always a normal subgroup of the original group, and the other equivalence classes are precisely the cosets of that normal subgroup. The resulting quotient is written , where formula_2 is the original group and formula_3 is the normal subgroup. This is read as &quot;, where formula_4 is short for modulo. (The notation should be interpreted with caution, as some authors (e.g., Vinberg) use it to represent the left cosets of formula_5 in formula_2 for &quot;any&quot; subgroup formula_5, even though these cosets do not form a group if formula_5 is not normal in . Others (e.g., Dummit and Foote) use this notation to refer only to the quotient group, with the appearance of this notation implying that formula_5 is normal in .)

Much of the importance of quotient groups is derived from their relation to homomorphisms. The first isomorphism theorem states that the image of any group formula_2 under a homomorphism is always isomorphic to a quotient of . Specifically, the image of formula_2 under a homomorphism formula_12 is isomorphic to formula_13 where formula_14 denotes the kernel of .

The dual notion of a quotient group is a subgroup, these being the two primary ways of forming a smaller group from a larger one. Any normal subgroup has a corresponding quotient group, formed from the larger group by eliminating the distinction between elements of the subgroup. In category theory, quotient groups are examples of quotient objects, which are dual to subobjects.

== Definition and illustration ==
Given a group formula_2 and a subgroup , and a fixed element formula_16, one can consider the corresponding left coset: . Cosets are a natural class of subsets of a group; for example consider the abelian group formula_2 of integers, with operation defined by the usual addition, and the subgroup formula_5 of even integers. Then there are exactly two cosets: , which are the even integers, and , which are the odd integers (here we are using additive notation for the binary operation instead of multiplicative notation).

For a general subgroup , it is desirable to define a compatible group operation on the set of all possible cosets, . This is possible exactly when formula_5 is a normal subgroup, see below. A subgroup formula_3 of a group formula_2 is normal if and only if the coset equality formula_22 holds for all . A normal subgroup of formula_2 is denoted .

=== Definition ===
Let formula_3 be a normal subgroup of a group . Define the set formula_25 to be the set of all left cosets of formula_3 in . That is, . 

Since the identity element , . Define a binary operation on the set of cosets, , as follows. For each formula_27 and formula_28 in , the product of formula_27 and , , is . This works only because formula_30 does not depend on the choice of the representatives, formula_31 and , of each left coset, formula_27 and . To prove this, suppose formula_33 and formula_34 for some . Then
: formula_35

This depends on the fact that is a normal subgroup. It still remains to be shown that this condition is not only sufficient but necessary to define the operation on .

To show that it is necessary, consider that for a subgroup formula_3 of , we have been given that the operation is well defined. That is, for all formula_33 and for .

Let formula_38 and . Since , we have .

Now, formula_39 and .

Hence formula_3 is a normal subgroup of .

It can also be checked that this operation on formula_25 is always associative, formula_25 has identity element , and the inverse of element formula_27 can always be represented by . Therefore, the set formula_25 together with the operation defined by formula_45 forms a group, the quotient group of formula_2 by .

Due to the normality of , the left cosets and right cosets of formula_3 in formula_2 are the same, and so, formula_25 could have been defined to be the set of right cosets of formula_3 in .

=== Example: Addition modulo 6 ===

For example, consider the group with addition modulo 6: . Consider the subgroup , which is normal because formula_2 is abelian. Then the set of (left) cosets is of size three:
: formula_52

The binary operation defined above makes this set into a group, known as the quotient group, which in this case is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3.

== Motivation for the name &quot;quotient&quot; ==
The quotient group formula_25 can be compared to division of integers. When dividing 12 by 3 one obtains the result 4 because one can regroup 12 objects into 4 subcollections of 3 objects. The quotient group is the same idea, although one ends up with a group for a final answer instead of a number because groups have more structure than an arbitrary collection of objects: in the quotient , the group structure is used to form a natural &quot;regrouping&quot;. These are the cosets of formula_3 in . Because we started with a group and normal subgroup, the final quotient contains more information than just the number of cosets (which is what regular division yields), but instead has a group structure itself.

== Examples ==
=== Even and odd integers ===
Consider the group of integers formula_55 (under addition) and the subgroup formula_56 consisting of all even integers. This is a normal subgroup, because formula_55 is abelian. There are only two cosets: the set of even integers and the set of odd integers, and therefore the quotient group formula_58 is the cyclic group with two elements. This quotient group is isomorphic with the set formula_59 with addition modulo 2; informally, it is sometimes said that formula_58 &quot;equals&quot; the set formula_59 with addition modulo 2.

Example further explained...
: Let formula_62 be the remainders of formula_63 when dividing by . Then, formula_64 when formula_65 is even and formula_66 when formula_65 is odd.
: By definition of , the kernel of , , is the set of all even integers.
: Let . Then, formula_68 is a subgroup, because the identity in , which is , is in , the sum of two even integers is even and hence if formula_65 and formula_70 are in , formula_71 is in formula_68 (closure) and if formula_65 is even, formula_74 is also even and so formula_68 contains its inverses.
: Define formula_76 as formula_77 for formula_78 and formula_79 is the quotient group of left cosets; .
: Note that we have defined , formula_80 is formula_81 if formula_82 is odd and formula_83 if formula_82 is even.
: Thus, formula_85 is an isomorphism from formula_79 to .

=== Remainders of integer division ===
A slight generalization of the last example. Once again consider the group of integers formula_55 under addition. Let be any positive integer. We will consider the subgroup formula_88 of formula_55 consisting of all multiples of . Once again formula_88 is normal in formula_55 because formula_55 is abelian. The cosets are the collection . An integer formula_93 belongs to the coset , where formula_94 is the remainder when dividing formula_93 by . The quotient formula_96 can be thought of as the group of &quot;remainders&quot; modulo . This is a cyclic group of order .

=== Complex integer roots of 1 ===

The twelfth roots of unity, which are points on the complex unit circle, form a multiplicative abelian group , shown on the picture on the right as colored balls with the number at each point giving its complex argument. Consider its subgroup formula_3 made of the fourth roots of unity, shown as red balls. This normal subgroup splits the group into three cosets, shown in red, green and blue. One can check that the cosets form a group of three elements (the product of a red element with a blue element is blue, the inverse of a blue element is green, etc.). Thus, the quotient group formula_25 is the group of three colors, which turns out to be the cyclic group with three elements.

=== Real numbers modulo the integers ===
Consider the group of real numbers formula_99 under addition, and the subgroup formula_55 of integers. Each coset of formula_55 in formula_99 is a set of the form , where formula_31 is a real number. Since formula_104 and formula_105 are identical sets when the non-integer parts of formula_106 and formula_107 are equal, one may impose the restriction formula_108 without change of meaning. Adding such cosets is done by adding the corresponding real numbers, and subtracting 1 if the result is greater than or equal to 1. The quotient group formula_109 is isomorphic to the circle group, the group of complex numbers of absolute value 1 under multiplication, or correspondingly, the group of rotations in 2D about the origin, that is, the special orthogonal group . An isomorphism is given by formula_110 (see Euler&#x27;s identity).

=== Matrices of real numbers ===
If formula_2 is the group of invertible formula_112 real matrices, and formula_3 is the subgroup of formula_112 real matrices with determinant 1, then formula_3 is normal in formula_2 (since it is the kernel of the determinant homomorphism). The cosets of formula_3 are the sets of matrices with a given determinant, and hence formula_25 is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of non-zero real numbers. The group formula_3 is known as the special linear group .

=== Integer modular arithmetic ===
Consider the abelian group formula_120 (that is, the set formula_121 with addition modulo 4), and its subgroup . The quotient group formula_122 is . This is a group with identity element , and group operations such as . Both the subgroup formula_123 and the quotient group formula_124 are isomorphic with .

=== Integer multiplication ===
Consider the multiplicative group . The set formula_3 of th residues is a multiplicative subgroup isomorphic to . Then formula_3 is normal in formula_2 and the factor group formula_25 has the cosets . The Paillier cryptosystem is based on the conjecture that it is difficult to determine the coset of a random element of formula_2 without knowing the factorization of .

== Properties ==
The quotient group formula_130 is isomorphic to the trivial group (the group with one element), and formula_131 is isomorphic to .

The order of , by definition the number of elements, is equal to , the index of formula_3 in . If formula_2 is finite, the index is also equal to the order of formula_2 divided by the order of . The set formula_25 may be finite, although both formula_2 and formula_3 are infinite (for example, ).

There is a &quot;natural&quot; surjective group homomorphism , sending each element formula_138 of formula_2 to the coset of formula_3 to which formula_138 belongs, that is: . The mapping formula_142 is sometimes called the &quot;canonical projection of formula_2 onto &quot;. Its kernel is .

There is a bijective correspondence between the subgroups of formula_2 that contain formula_3 and the subgroups of ; if formula_5 is a subgroup of formula_2 containing , then the corresponding subgroup of formula_25 is . This correspondence holds for normal subgroups of formula_2 and formula_25 as well, and is formalized in the lattice theorem.

Several important properties of quotient groups are recorded in the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms and the isomorphism theorems.

If formula_2 is abelian, nilpotent, solvable, cyclic or finitely generated, then so is .

If formula_5 is a subgroup in a finite group , and the order of formula_5 is one half of the order of , then formula_5 is guaranteed to be a normal subgroup, so formula_155 exists and is isomorphic to . This result can also be stated as &quot;any subgroup of index 2 is normal&quot;, and in this form it applies also to infinite groups. Furthermore, if formula_156 is the smallest prime number dividing the order of a finite group, , then if formula_155 has order , formula_5 must be a normal subgroup of .

Given formula_2 and a normal subgroup , then formula_2 is a group extension of formula_25 by . One could ask whether this extension is trivial or split; in other words, one could ask whether formula_2 is a direct product or semidirect product of formula_3 and . This is a special case of the extension problem. An example where the extension is not split is as follows: Let , and , which is isomorphic to . Then formula_25 is also isomorphic to . But formula_165 has only the trivial automorphism, so the only semi-direct product of formula_3 and formula_25 is the direct product. Since formula_168 is different from , we conclude that formula_2 is not a semi-direct product of formula_3 and .

== Quotients of Lie groups ==
If formula_2 is a Lie group and formula_3 is a normal and closed (in the topological rather than the algebraic sense of the word) Lie subgroup of , the quotient formula_25 is also a Lie group. In this case, the original group &quot;formula_2&quot; has the structure of a fiber bundle (specifically, a principal -bundle), with base space formula_25 and fiber . The dimension of formula_25 equals .

Note that the condition that formula_3 is closed is necessary. Indeed, if formula_3 is not closed then the quotient space is not a T1-space (since there is a coset in the quotient which cannot be separated from the identity by an open set), and thus not a Hausdorff space.

For a non-normal Lie subgroup , the space formula_25 of left cosets is not a group, but simply a differentiable manifold on which formula_2 acts. The result is known as a homogeneous space.

<text>In abstract algebra, the [[fundamental theorem]] on homomorphisms, also known as the fundamental homomorphism theorem, or the first isomorphism theorem, relates the structure of two objects between which a homomorphism is given, and of the kernel and image of the homomorphism.

The homomorphism theorem is used to prove the isomorphism theorems. Similar theorems are valid for vector spaces, modules, and rings. 

== Group-theoretic version ==

Given two groups formula_1 and formula_2 and a group homomorphism formula_3, let formula_4 be a normal subgroup in formula_1 and formula_6 the natural surjective homomorphism formula_7 (where formula_8 is the quotient group of formula_1 by formula_4). If formula_4 is a subset of formula_12 (where formula_13 represents a kernel) then there exists a unique homomorphism formula_14 such that formula_15.

In other words, the natural projection formula_6 is universal among homomorphisms on formula_1 that map formula_4 to the identity element.

The situation is described by the following commutative diagram:

formula_19 is injective if and only if formula_20. Therefore, by setting formula_20, we immediately get the first isomorphism theorem.

We can write the statement of the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms of groups as &quot;every homomorphic image of a group is isomorphic to a quotient group&quot;.

== Proof ==
The proof follows from two basic facts about homomorphisms, namely their preservation of the group operation, and their mapping of the identity element to the identity element. We need to show that if formula_22 is a homomorphism of groups, then: 
# formula_23 is a subgroup of .
# formula_24 is isomorphic to .

=== Proof of 1 ===
The operation that is preserved by formula_6 is the group operation. If , then there exist elements formula_26 such that formula_27 and . For these formula_28 and , we have formula_29 (since formula_6 preserves the group operation), and thus, the closure property is satisfied in . The identity element formula_31 is also in formula_23 because formula_6 maps the identity element of formula_1 to it. Since every element formula_35 in formula_1 has an inverse formula_37 such that formula_38 (because formula_6 preserves the inverse property as well), we have an inverse for each element formula_40 in , therefore, formula_23 is a subgroup of . 

=== Proof of 2 ===
Construct a map formula_42 by . This map is well-defined, as if , then formula_43 and so formula_44 which gives . This map is an isomorphism. formula_45 is surjective onto formula_23 by definition. To show injectivity, if formula_47, then , which implies formula_48 so . 

Finally,

:formula_49
:formula_50

hence formula_45 preserves the group operation. Hence formula_45 is an isomorphism between formula_24 and , which completes the proof.

== Applications ==
The group theoretic version of fundamental homomorphism theorem can be used to show that two selected groups are isomorphic. Two examples are shown below.

=== Integers modulo &quot;n&quot; ===
For each , consider the groups formula_54 and formula_55 and a group homomorphism formula_56 defined by formula_57 (see modular arithmetic). Next, consider the kernel of , , which is a normal subgroup in . There exists a natural surjective homomorphism formula_58 defined by . The theorem asserts that there exists an isomorphism formula_59 between formula_55 and , or in other words . The commutative diagram is illustrated below.

=== &quot;N / C&quot; theorem ===
Let formula_1 be a group with subgroup . Let , formula_62 and formula_63 be the centralizer, the normalizer and the automorphism group of formula_64 in , respectively. Then, the formula_65 theorem states that formula_66 is isomorphic to a subgroup of .

==== Proof ====
We are able to find a group homomorphism formula_67 defined by , for all . Clearly, the kernel of formula_68 is . Hence, we have a natural surjective homomorphism formula_69 defined by . The fundamental homomorphism theorem then asserts that there exists an isomorphism between formula_70 and , which is a subgroup of .

<text>In particle physics, a fermion is a subatomic particle that follows Fermi–Dirac statistics. Fermions have a half-integer spin (spin, spin, etc.) and obey the Pauli exclusion principle. These particles include all quarks and leptons and all composite particles made of an odd number of these, such as all baryons and many atoms and nuclei. Fermions differ from bosons, which obey Bose–Einstein statistics.

Some fermions are elementary particles (such as electrons), and some are composite particles (such as protons). For example, according to the spin-statistics theorem in relativistic quantum field theory, particles with integer spin are bosons. In contrast, particles with half-integer spin are fermions.

In addition to the spin characteristic, fermions have another specific property: they possess conserved baryon or lepton quantum numbers. Therefore, what is usually referred to as the spin-statistics relation is, in fact, a spin statistics-quantum number relation.

As a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle, only one fermion can occupy a particular quantum state at a given time. Suppose multiple fermions have the same spatial probability distribution, then, at least one property of each fermion, such as its spin, must be different. Fermions are usually associated with matter, whereas bosons are generally force carrier particles. However, in the current state of particle physics, the distinction between the two concepts is unclear. Weakly interacting fermions can also display bosonic behavior under extreme conditions. For example, at low temperatures, fermions show superfluidity for uncharged particles and superconductivity for charged particles.

Composite fermions, such as protons and neutrons, are the key building blocks of everyday matter.

English theoretical physicist Paul Dirac coined the name fermion from the surname of Italian physicist Enrico Fermi.

==Elementary fermions==

The Standard Model recognizes two types of elementary fermions: quarks and leptons. In all, the model distinguishes 24 different fermions. There are six quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom and top), and six leptons (electron, electron neutrino, muon, muon neutrino, tauon and tauon neutrino), along with the corresponding antiparticle of each of these.

Mathematically, there are many varieties of fermions, with the three most common types being:
* Weyl fermions (massless),
* Dirac fermions (massive), and
* Majorana fermions (each its own antiparticle).
Most Standard Model fermions are believed to be Dirac fermions, although it is unknown at this time whether the neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana fermions (or both). Dirac fermions can be treated as a combination of two Weyl fermions. In July 2015, Weyl fermions have been experimentally realized in Weyl semimetals.

==Composite fermions==
Composite particles (such as hadrons, nuclei, and atoms) can be bosons or fermions depending on their constituents. More precisely, because of the relation between spin and statistics, a particle containing an odd number of fermions is itself a fermion. It will have half-integer spin.

Examples include the following:
*A baryon, such as the proton or neutron, contains three fermionic quarks.
*The nucleus of a carbon-13 atom contains six protons and seven neutrons.
*The atom helium-3 (3He) consists of two protons, one neutron, and two electrons. The deuterium atom consists of one proton, one neutron, and one electron.

The number of bosons within a composite particle made up of simple particles bound with a potential has no effect on whether it is a boson or a fermion.

Fermionic or bosonic behavior of a composite particle (or system) is only seen at large (compared to size of the system) distances. At proximity, where spatial structure begins to be important, a composite particle (or system) behaves according to its constituent makeup.

Fermions can exhibit bosonic behavior when they become loosely bound in pairs. This is the origin of superconductivity and the superfluidity of helium-3: in superconducting materials, electrons interact through the exchange of phonons, forming Cooper pairs, while in helium-3, Cooper pairs are formed via spin fluctuations.

The quasiparticles of the fractional quantum Hall effect are also known as composite fermions; they consist of electrons with an even number of quantized vortices attached to them.

<doc id="11530" wikidata="Q447392" url="?curid=11530" title="Fred Savage">
<text>Frederick Aaron Savage (born July 9, 1976) is an American actor and director. He is best known for his role as Kevin Arnold in the American television series &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; (1988–1993). He has earned several awards and nominations, such as People&#x27;s Choice Awards and Young Artist Awards. He is also known for playing the Grandson in &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, and voiced the title protagonist in &quot;Oswald&quot;. Savage has worked as a director, and in 2005 later starred in the television sitcom &quot;Crumbs&quot;. Savage returned to acting in the television series &quot;The Grinder&quot;, as well as the Netflix series &quot;Friends from College&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Savage was born in Chicago, to Joanne and Lewis Savage, who was an industrial real estate broker and consultant. Savage grew up in Glencoe, Illinois, before moving to Southern California. His younger brother is actor Ben Savage and his younger sister is actress/musician Kala Savage. His grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Poland, Ukraine, Germany and Latvia. He was raised in Reform Judaism.

Savage was educated at Brentwood School, a private co-educational day school in Brentwood, in the Westside area of Los Angeles. He graduated from Stanford University in 1999, with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English and as a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

==Career==

===Acting===
Savage&#x27;s first screen performance was in the television show &quot;Morningstar/Eveningstar&quot;, at the age of nine. He then appeared onscreen in &quot;The Boy Who Could Fly&quot;, &quot;Dinosaurs!&quot;, and several television shows, including &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;Crime Story&quot; before gaining national attention as the grandson in the 1987 film &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; opposite Peter Falk.

In 1988, Savage appeared as Kevin Arnold on &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, the role for which he is best known, and for which he received two Golden Globe nominations and two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. At the age of thirteen, he was the youngest actor ever to receive these honors. He remained on the show until it ended in 1993. During this period, he appeared in several films, most notably &quot;Vice Versa&quot; (1988), and also starred in &quot;Little Monsters&quot; and &quot;The Wizard&quot;. After &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; ended, Savage returned to high school at age 17, and later attended Stanford. His first television role after high school was the NBC sitcom &quot;Working&quot;, which Savage starred in for its two-season run. Savage also had a series of guest and supporting roles in the late 1990s and the 2000s such as on the show &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, (which starred his younger brother Ben Savage), &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Prince Valiant&quot;, and the film &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; as The Mole.

Savage has lent his voice to several animated projects, including &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Kim Possible&quot;, &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, &quot;Oswald&quot;, and &quot;Holidaze: The Christmas That Almost Didn&#x27;t Happen&quot;. His two lead roles since &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; were on the short-lived sitcoms &quot;Working&quot; and &quot;Crumbs&quot;. He ranked at #27 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Kid Stars&quot;.

In July 2008, Savage guest-starred in the web series &quot;The Rascal&quot; on Crackle.

In 2015, Savage returned to acting with the Fox series &quot;The Grinder&quot;. Producer Nick Stoller approached Savage about playing the role of Stewart on &quot;The Grinder&quot;. Savage was uninterested at first, but agreed to meet with the producers of the series because his children attended school with Stoller&#x27;s children. Savage eventually agreed to take on the role. &quot;The Grinder&quot; was canceled by Fox on May 16, 2016.

In 2017, he joined the cast of the Netflix series &quot;Friends from College&quot; as Max Adler, a gay literary agent.

===Directing and producing===
In 1999, Savage began his directing career in which he helmed episodes of over a dozen television series. Savage&#x27;s first directing credit was on the short-lived NBC sitcom &quot;Working&quot; which also starred Savage. Following &quot;Working&quot;, Savage began observing production on the Disney Channel show &quot;Even Stevens&quot; to further learn the craft of directing. Savage also learned by shadowing Amy Sherman-Palladino, Todd Holland, and James Burrows.

His credits include &quot;Zoey 101&quot;, &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot;, &quot;Ned&#x27;s Declassified School Survival Guide&quot; and &quot;Big Time Rush&quot; for Nickelodeon, as well as &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot;, &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;, and &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot; for Disney Channel. Additionally, Savage has directed for prime-time network sitcoms including &quot;Modern Family&quot; and &quot;2 Broke Girls&quot;.

Besides directing several episodes, Savage co-produced the Disney Channel Original Series &quot;Phil of the Future&quot;. In 2007, he was nominated for a Directors Guild award for the &quot;Phil&quot; episode &quot;Not-So-Great-Great Grandpa&quot;.

Savage has served as a producer for several episodes of &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;, &quot;Friends with Benefits&quot;, &quot;Party Down&quot;, &quot;Phil of the Future&quot;, &quot;The Crazy Ones&quot;, and &quot;Happy Endings&quot;.

In 2007, he made his feature film directing debut with the film &quot;Daddy Day Camp&quot; for which he was nominated worst director for the Golden Raspberry Awards.

=== Misconduct allegations ===
In 1993, Savage, then 16, and his &quot;Wonder Years&quot; co-star Jason Hervey were accused of sexual harassment in a lawsuit filed by the show&#x27;s former costume designer. Monique Long alleged the young actors &quot;verbally and physically harassed her daily,&quot; with her complaints over their behavior ignored by the show&#x27;s staff. The lawsuit was settled out of court.

In March 2018, a costume designer on &quot;The Grinder&quot; accused Savage of assault and intimidation and filed a complaint in Los Angeles Superior Court alleging crimes including assault, battery, and gender discrimination. Savage denied the allegations. Fox later stated that an investigation cleared the actor of any wrongdoing.

On May 6, 2022, Savage was fired as executive producer and director of &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; reboot after an investigation into alleged inappropriate conduct. While Savage stated that &#x27;some of the claims were untrue&#x27;, he also stated that he was going to work on changing any perceived negative behavior.

== Personal life ==
Savage married his childhood friend Jennifer Lynn Stone on August 7, 2004. They have three children.
He is a distant cousin from Calvin Coolidge

<text>The Futurians were a group of science fiction fans, many of whom became editors and writers as well. The Futurians were based in New York City and were a major force in the development of science fiction writing and science fiction fandom in the years 1937–1945.

==Origins of the group==
As described in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s 1979 autobiography &quot;In Memory Yet Green&quot;, the Futurians spun off from the Greater New York Science Fiction Club (headed by Sam Moskowitz, later an influential sci-fi editor and historian) over ideological differences, with the Futurians wishing to take a more overtly Marxist political stance. Other sources indicate that Donald A. Wollheim was pushing for a more left-wing direction with a goal of leading fandom toward a political ideal, all of which Moskowitz resisted. As a result, Wollheim broke off from the Greater New York group and founded the Futurians in September, 1938. The fans following Moskowitz reorganized into the Queens Science Fiction Club.
Frederik Pohl, in his autobiography &quot;The Way the Future Was&quot;, said that the origin of the Futurians lay with the Science Fiction League founded by Hugo Gernsback in 1934, the local New York City chapter of which was called the &quot;Brooklyn Science Fiction League,&quot; headed by G. G. Clark.

Wollheim, John Michel, and Robert A. W. Lowndes were also members of the Brooklyn Science Fiction League. Along with Pohl, the four started calling themselves the &quot;Quadrumvirate&quot;. Pohl, commenting about that time, said &quot;we four marched from Brooklyn to the sea, leaving a wide scar of burned out clubs behind us. We changed clubs the way Detroit changes tailfins, every year had a new one, and last year&#x27;s was junk&quot;.

There were several club names during that period, before finally settling on the Futurians. In 1935 there was the East New York Science Fiction League, later the Independent League for Science Fiction. In 1936 came the International Cosmos Science Club, which also involved Will Sykora. Pohl then says that &quot;on reflection &#x27;Cosmos&#x27; seemed to take in a bit more territory than was justified, so we changed it to the International Scientific Association (it wasn&#x27;t International either, but then it also wasn&#x27;t scientific)&quot;. It was then renamed the New York Branch-International Scientific Association.

In 1937, after a falling-out with Will Sykora and others, the &quot;Quadrumvirate&quot; went on to found the Futurians. Sykora then founded the Queens Science Fiction League with Sam Moskowitz and James V. Taurasi. Later, the Queens Science Fiction League changed into New Fandom. Pohl said the New Fandom and the Futurians were &quot;Addicted to Feuds&quot;, that &quot;No CIA nor KGB ever wrestled so valiantly for the soul of an emerging nation as New Fandom and the Futurians did for science fiction&quot;.

Most of the group&#x27;s members also had professional ambitions within science fiction and related fields, and collectively were very effective at achieving this goal, as the roster of members suggests. At one point in the earliest 1940s, approximately half of all the pulp sci-fi and fantasy magazines in the U.S. were being edited by Futurians: Frederik Pohl at the Popular Publications offshoot Fictioneers, Inc. (&quot;Astonishing Stories&quot; and &quot;Super-Science Stories&quot;); Robert Lowndes at Columbia Publications, most notably with &quot;Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;Future Fiction&quot; (though through the decade to come, Lowndes&#x27;s responsibilities would expand to other types of fiction magazine in the chain), and Donald Wollheim at the very marginal Albing Publications with the short-lived, micro-budgeted &quot;Cosmic Stories&quot; and &quot;Stirring Science Stories&quot; (Wollheim soon moved on to Avon Books; Doë &quot;Leslie Perri&quot; Baumgardt also worked on a romance fiction title for Albing). Most of these projects had small editorial budgets, and relied in part, or occasionally entirely, on contributions from fellow Futurians for their contents.

==Political tendencies==

At the time the Futurians were formed, Donald Wollheim was strongly attracted by communism and believed that followers of science fiction &quot;should actively work for the realization of the scientific world-state as the only genuine justification for their activities and existence&quot;. It was to this end that Wollheim formed the Futurians, and many of its members were in some degree interested in the political applications of science fiction. Members of the Futurians, including Wollheim, Michel, Lowndes, and Cohen briefly became interested in Technocracy, a utopian movement led by Howard Scott, and attended a study course, although they later dismissed Scott as a &quot;crackpot&quot;.

Hence the group included supporters of Trotskyism, like Judith Merril and others who would have been deemed far left for the era (Frederik Pohl became a member of the Communist Party in 1936, but quit in 1939).

Pohl, in his autobiography, &quot;The Way the Future Was&quot;, said Wollheim voted for Republican Presidential Candidate Alfred Landon in 1936.

<text>First Fandom is an informal association of early, active and well-known science fiction fans.

In 1958, a number of fans at Midwestcon realized amid table-talk that they all had been active in fandom for more than 20 years. This inspired the creation of an organization for longstanding fans under the initial chairmanship of Robert A. Madle, who &quot;in 1958 suggested the idea of forming an organization called First Fandom&quot;. Originally, only those fans who were known to have been active in fandom before the cutoff date, January 1, 1938, were eligible. Such fannish activity (or &quot;fanac&quot;) including writing to letter columns in science fiction magazines, having been published in fanzines, or having participated in science fiction oriented clubs, or just generally doing fannish things.

The term itself is an oblique reference to Olaf Stapledon&#x27;s classic science fiction epic &quot;Last and First Men&quot;. In this book the stages of mankind are enumerated. Thus early 1950s historian of fandom Jack Speer began to label successive generations of fans as First Fandom, Second Fandom, Third Fandom, and so forth... all the way to Seventh Fandom and beyond.

Currently, the organization allows several classes of membership. For example, a &quot;Dinosaur&quot; is a member who was active before the first Worldcon (World Science Fiction Convention) held on July 4, 1939, while &quot;Associate Membership&quot; requires provable activity in fandom for more than three decades.

First Fandom annually presents its First Fandom Hall of Fame award and Sam Moskowitz Archive Award for excellence in science fiction collecting. at the beginning of the Hugo Awards Ceremony at the World Science Fiction Convention.

There is an analogous informal society in Finnish fandom called the &quot;Dinosaur Club&quot;; the cutoff being the first major Finnish con Kingcon.

<text>Fianna Fáil ( ; ; meaning &quot;Soldiers of Destiny&quot; or &quot;Warriors of Fál&quot;), officially Fianna Fáil – The Republican Party (), is a centre to centre-right political party in Ireland. 

Founded as a republican party in 1926 by Éamon de Valera and his supporters after they split from Sinn Féin in order to take seats in the Oireachtas, which Sinn Féin refused to recognise, since 1927 Fianna Fáil has been one of Ireland&#x27;s two major parties, along with Fine Gael since 1933; both are seen as centre-right parties, to the right of the Labour Party and Sinn Féin. The party dominated Irish political life for most of the 20th century, and, since its foundation, either it or Fine Gael has led every government. Between 1932 and 2011, it was the largest party in Dáil Éireann, but latterly with a decline in its vote share; from 1989 onwards, its periods of government were in coalition with parties of either the left or the right.

Fianna Fáil&#x27;s vote collapsed in the 2011 general election; it ended in third place, in what was widely seen as a political realignment in the wake of the post-2008 Irish economic downturn. By 2016, it had recovered enough to become the largest opposition party, and it entered a confidence and supply arrangement with a Fine Gael–led minority government. In 2020, after a number of months of political stalemate following the general election, Fianna Fáil agreed with Fine Gael and the Green Party to enter into an unprecedented coalition, with the leaders of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael rotating between the roles of Taoiseach and Tánaiste.

Fianna Fáil is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and of Liberal International. From 2019 to 2022, Fianna Fáil was in partnership with the Social Democratic and Labour Party in Northern Ireland.

==History==

Fianna Fáil was founded by Éamon de Valera, a former leader of Sinn Féin. The previous year, de Valera proposed a motion calling for elected members to be allowed to take their seats in Dáil Éireann if and when the controversial Oath of Allegiance was removed. It failed to pass at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis, leading de Valera and a number of other members, including most of Sinn Féin&#x27;s parliamentary talent, to split from Sinn Féin. His new party adopted its name on 2 April of the same year. While it was also opposed to the Treaty settlement, it rejected abstentionism, instead aiming to republicanise the Irish Free State from within. Fianna Fáil&#x27;s platform of economic autarky had appeal among the farmers, working-class people and the poor, while alienating more affluent classes. It largely pre-empted voters of the aforementioned groups from the Labour Party (with its almost identical economic and social policy) following its entry into the Dáil in 1927. Fianna Fáil would go on to style themselves for several decades as &quot;the real Labour Party&quot;.

Cumann na nGaedheal sought to exploit the notion that Fianna Fáil was a party in thrall to communists. During the 1932 general election campaign, Cumann na nGaedheal declared in a newspaper advert that &quot;the gunmen and Communists are voting for Fianna Fáil today – vote for the Government party.&quot; However, Fianna Fáil won the election, forming its first government on 9 March 1932. It was in power for 61 of the 79 years between then and the election of 2011. Its longest continuous period in office was its first, 15 years and 11 months (March 1932 – February 1948). Its longest single period out of office in the 20th century was four years and four months (March 1973 – July 1977). All of the party&#x27;s leaders have served as Taoiseach.

The party&#x27;s most dominant era was the 41-year period between 1932 and 1973, when party leaders Éamon de Valera, Seán Lemass and Jack Lynch served as Taoiseach in an almost unbroken chain save for two three-year stints by John A. Costello. De Valera&#x27;s reign is acknowledged for having successfully guided Ireland through World War II unscathed but is criticised for leaving Ireland in economic and cultural stagnation. His successors such as Lemass however were able to turn around Ireland&#x27;s economic fortunes as well as primed the country for entry into the European Economic Community, later the European Union.
Fianna Fáil&#x27;s fortunes began to falter in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970 the Arms Crisis threatened to split the entire party in two when Fianna Fáil cabinet ministers Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney were dismissed by Jack Lynch after being accused of seeking to provide arms to the newly emergent Provisional Irish Republican Army. Factional infighting over Northern Ireland, economics and the &quot;moral issues&quot; such as the legalization of divorce, abortion, and contraception plagued the party in this era and grew particularly intense when Charles Haughey later became party leader. Under Haughey, Fianna Fáil lost both the 1981 general election and November 1982 general election to Garret FitzGerald&#x27;s Fine Gael during a particularly chaotic time in Ireland&#x27;s political and economic history. Numerous failed internal attempts to oust Haughey as leader of the party culminated in the most significant split in the party&#x27;s history when a large portion of the membership walked out to create the Progressive Democrats in 1985, under the leadership of Haughey archrival Desmond O&#x27;Malley. Haughey was forced to resign as Taoiseach and party leader in 1992 following revelations about his role in a phone tapping scandal.

Although the two parties had seemed poised to be bitter enemies owing to the personal conflicts between the memberships, from 1989 onwards Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats served repeatedly in coalition governments together, helping to stabilise Fianna Fáil. In 1994 Fianna Fáil came under the new leadership of Haughey protégé Bertie Ahern, who also became Taoiseach in 1997. Under Ahern, Fianna Fáil was able to claim credit for helping to broker the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 which began the peace process in Northern Ireland, as well the economic upswing caused by the Celtic Tiger which saw Ireland&#x27;s economy boom during the 2000s. However, this momentum came to a sharp and sudden halt following two events. Firstly, Ahern was forced to resign as Taoiseach and left the party in 2008 following revelations made in the Mahon Tribunal that Ahern had accepted money from property developers. Secondly, the party, which was still in government under a new leader and Taoiseach Brian Cowen, was held responsible for the effects of the post-2008 Irish economic downturn. The party&#x27;s popularity crashed: an opinion poll on 27 February 2009 indicated that only 10% of voters were satisfied with the Government&#x27;s performance.

In the 2011 general election, it suffered the worst defeat of a sitting government in the history of the Irish state. This loss was described as &quot;historic&quot; in its proportions and &quot;unthinkable&quot;. The party sank from being the largest in the Dáil to the third-largest, losing 58 of its 78 seats. This broke 79 consecutive years of Fianna Fáil being the largest single party in the Dáil. That election took place with Micheál Martin as leader, as Cowen had resigned as party leader in January 2011, although retained his role as Taoiseach until the election. Cowen&#x27;s premiership was sharply criticised in the media, with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; describing Cowen&#x27;s tenure as Taoiseach as &quot;a dismal failure&quot; and in 2011 the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; calling Cowen the &quot;worst Taoiseach in the history of the State.&quot;

===Since 2011===

Martin continued to lead Fianna Fáil past 2011; In the 2016 general election Martin&#x27;s Fianna Fáil made a moderate recovery while Fine Gael retained control of the government as a minority government, made possible by a confidence and supply agreement with Fianna Fáíl.

In 2018 the party was divided internally over how to handle that year&#x27;s referendum on the Eighth Amendment, the provision in the Irish constitution which forbade abortion. A significant portion of both the parliamentary party and the ordinary membership favoured a No vote, which would keep abortion illegal for non–life-threatening pregnancies. Leader Micheál Martin signalled his own desire for a Yes vote, but was unable to bring the party under one stance, and ultimately more than half of Fianna Fáil&#x27;s TDs campaigned for a No vote. On polling day the Yes side won, 66% to 33%.

After the 2020 general election, for the first time in history, Fianna Fáil entered into a coalition government with its traditional rival Fine Gael, as well as the Green Party, ending its longest period out of government since its formation. Under the agreement, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin served as Taoiseach for the first half of the parliamentary term. That same year a number of Fianna Fáil members were involved in the &quot;Golfgate&quot; scandal, an event that ultimately led to the resignation of Fianna Fáil deputy leader Dara Calleary. In July 2021 Fianna Fáil suffered what a number of sources suggested might have been the single worst result in its history when the party polled extremely poorly in the 2021 Dublin Bay South by-election. The result prompted Jim O&#x27;Callaghan and Cathal Crowe to question whether Martin should lead the party into its next general election. In February 2023, former leader Bertie Ahern rejoined the party, having left in 2012. Over the course of 2024, several sitting Fianna Fáil councillors and former party members left to join the right-wing Independent Ireland party.

Following the 2024 Irish general election, Fianna Fáil became the largest party in the Dáil and led the creation of a government.

==Organisation and structure==
Fianna Fáil uses a structure called a cumann system. The basic unit was the &quot;cumann&quot; (branch); these were grouped into &quot;comhairlí ceantair&quot; (district branches) and a &quot;comhairle dáil ceantair&quot; (constituency branch) in every constituency. The party claimed that in 2005 they had 50,000 registered names, but only an estimated 10,000–15,000 members were considered active.

However, from the early 1990s onward, the &quot;cumann&quot; structure was weakened. Every &quot;cumann&quot; was entitled to three votes to selection conventions irrespective of its size; hence, a large number of &quot;cumainn&quot; had become in effect &quot;paper &quot;cumainn&quot;&quot;, the only use of which was to ensure an aspiring or sitting candidate got enough votes. Although this phenomenon was nothing new (the most famous example being Neil Blaney&#x27;s &quot;Donegal Mafia&quot;).

Since the 2007 election, the party&#x27;s structure has significantly weakened. This was in part exacerbated by significant infighting between candidates in the run-up to the 2011 general election. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; estimated that half of its 3,000 &quot;cumainn&quot; were effectively moribund. This fraction rose in Dublin with the exception of Dublin West, the former seat of both Brian Lenihan Snr and Brian Lenihan Jnr.

==Ideology and platform==

Fianna Fáil is primarily cited as being on the centre or centre-right of the political spectrum. Fianna Fáil&#x27;s ideology has been characterised both as conservative and ambiguous or malleable. The party has also been ideologically described as centrist, Christian democratic, liberal-conservative, populist, conservative-liberal, socially conservative, liberal, national-liberal and national-conservative. In 2017, academics Eoin O&#x27;Malley and Sean McGraw wrote that Fianna Fáil &quot;appears centrist, conservative, and attached to the state&quot;, but that there was &quot;deep ambiguity concerning what type of party Fianna Fáil really is&quot;.
In the modern era, Fianna Fáil is seen as a typical catch-all party and has defined itself as such. It has presented itself as a &quot;broad church&quot; and attracted support from across disparate social classes. In the 1980s, Brian Lenihan Snr declared &quot;there are no isms or [ide]ologies in my party&quot;; further, in the early 2000s, Fianna Fáil leader Bertie Ahern affirmed the party&#x27;s catch-all stance by defining Fianna Fáil as a party that &quot;looks out for the small ranking guy, the middle-ranking guy and assists the big guy&quot;. In 2023, party leader Micheál Martin described Fianna Fáil as &quot;a progressive republican party which rejects the failed and destructive idea that you must conform to the traditional left/right ideology&quot;.

Between 1989 and 2011, Fianna Fáil led coalition governments with parties of both the left and the right. Fianna Fáil&#x27;s platform contains a number of enduring commitments: to Irish unity; to the promotion and protection of the Irish language; and to maintaining Ireland&#x27;s tradition of military neutrality. The party&#x27;s name and logo incorporates the words &#x27;The Republican Party&#x27;. According to Fianna Fáil, &quot;Republican here stands both for the unity of the island and a commitment to the historic principles of European republican philosophy, namely liberty, equality and fraternity&quot;. The party&#x27;s main goal at its beginning was to reunite the North and the South.

Fianna Fáil is supportive of the European Union. Although part of the liberal Renew group in the European Parliament, its liberal nature has been disputed. As of 2009, Fianna Fáil did not always support Renew&#x27;s positions on civil liberties though the party did legalize same-sex civil partnerships in 2010. In 2014, Fianna Fáil expelled MEP Brian Crowley for joining the right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists Group, with the party stating that &quot;the ideas and principles of the ECR group and its component parties are totally incompatible with the core principles of Fianna Fáil&quot;. In recent years, Fianna Fáil has increasingly been seen as divided on social issues, and as moving towards a more social liberal profile. Fianna Fáil supported the unsuccessful 2024 Irish constitutional referendums, which would have deleted a reference to women&#x27;s domestic duties and broadened the definition of the family.

Evidence from expert surveys, opinion polls and candidate surveys have failed to identify strong distinctions between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Fianna Fáil is generally considered more populist and economically interventionist than its rival. University College Dublin professor Thomas Däubler wrote that Fianna Fáil had &quot;made a move to the centre&quot; in the 2016 election, which resulted in Fine Gael being placed &quot;considerably to the right&quot; of Fianna Fáil. In 2020, &quot;Time&quot; magazine described Fianna Fáil as &quot;slightly more socially conservative and further to the left on the economy&quot; than Fine Gael. Fianna Fáil has been described in modern times as struggling with its identity as a party. In 2023, Jack Sheehan of the &quot;The Irish Times&quot; wrote that &quot;for a decade now, a socially conservative, supposedly republican party has been led by a centrist social liberal with a more cautious position on Irish unification than even Leo Varadkar.&quot;

===20th century===
In the early 20th century, Fianna Fáil had a more explicitly working-class orientation. In 1926, Seán Lemass described the party as &quot;a progressive republican party based on the actual conditions of the moment&quot; while upon winning the 1932 Irish general election, newly elected Fianna Fáil TD Seán Moylan proclaimed that Fianna Fáil&#x27;s win meant a victory of &quot;the owners of the donkey and cart over the pony and trap class&quot;. The Fianna Fáil party of the 1930s has been described as an economically social democratic one that sought to create an economically independent state (autarky) via protectionist policies, based on its culturally nationalist thinking.

During the leadership of Seán Lemass in the 1960s, Fianna Fáil began to utilise some corporatist policies (embracing the concept of &#x27;social partnership&#x27;), taking some influence from Catholic social teaching. It was also during Lemass&#x27; time that the party shifted heavily away from autarkic thinking and towards a firm belief in free trade and foreign direct investment in Ireland.

In 1967, Jack Lynch described the party as &quot;left of centre&quot; while suggesting it was to the left of Fine Gael and Labour. However, during the 1969 Irish general election, the party ran red scare tactics against Labour after it began using the slogan &quot;the seventies will be socialist!&quot;. As Fine Gael became more and more socially liberal in the 1970s under Garret FitzGerald, the party reacted by embracing social conservatism and populism. In the same time period, the emergence of the Troubles and the Arms Crisis of 1971 tested the party&#x27;s nationalism, but despite these events, Fianna Fáil maintained their moderate culturally nationalist stance. In 1983, R. Ken Carty wrote of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that they were &quot;heterogeneous in their bases of support, relatively undifferentiated in terms of policy or programme, and remarkably stable in their support levels&quot;. 

In the 1990s, Fianna Fáil was described as a conservative and nationalist party.

==Fianna Fáil and Northern Ireland politics==
On 17 September 2007, Fianna Fáil announced that the party would for the first time organise in Northern Ireland. The then Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern was asked to chair a committee on the matter: &quot;In the period ahead Dermot Ahern will lead efforts to develop that strategy for carrying through this policy, examining timescales and structures. We will act gradually and strategically. We are under no illusions. It will not be easy. It will challenge us all. But I am confident we will succeed&quot;.

The party embarked on its first ever recruitment drive north of the border in September 2007 in northern universities, and established two &#x27;Political Societies&#x27;, the William Drennan Cumann in Queens University, Belfast, and the Watty Graham Cumann in UU Magee, Derry, which subsequently became official units of Fianna Fáil&#x27;s youth wing, attaining full membership and voting rights, and attained official voting delegates at the 2012 Ard Fheis. On 23 February 2008, it was announced that a former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) councillor, Colonel Harvey Bicker, had joined Fianna Fáil.

Bertie Ahern announced on 7 December 2007 that Fianna Fáil had been registered in Northern Ireland by the UK Electoral Commission.
The party&#x27;s Ard Fheis in 2009 unanimously passed a motion to organise in Northern Ireland by establishing forums, rather than cumainn, in each of its six counties. In December 2009, Fianna Fáil secured its first Northern Ireland Assembly MLA when Gerry McHugh, an independent MLA, announced he had joined the party. Mr. McHugh confirmed that although he had joined the party, he would continue to sit as an independent MLA. In June 2010, Fianna Fáil opened its first official office in Northern Ireland, in Crossmaglen, County Armagh. The then Taoiseach Brian Cowen officially opened the office, accompanied by Ministers Éamon Ó Cuív and Dermot Ahern and Deputies Rory O&#x27;Hanlon and Margaret Conlon. Discussing the party&#x27;s slow development towards all-Ireland politics, Mr. Cowen observed: &quot;We have a very open and pragmatic approach. We are a constitutional republican party and we make no secret of the aspirations on which this party was founded. It has always been very clear in our mind what it is we are seeking to achieve, that is to reconcile this country and not being prisoners of our past history. To be part of a generation that will build a new Ireland, an Ireland of which we can all be proud&quot;.

Fianna Fáil has not contested any elections in Northern Ireland since its registration and recognition there in 2007. At the party&#x27;s 2014 Ard Fheis, a motion was passed without debate to stand candidates for election north of the border for the first time in 2019.

Since 24 January 2019, the party have been in partnership with the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) formerly the main Irish nationalist party in Northern Ireland, but now smaller than Sinn Féin. There had long been speculation about the eventual partnership for several years prior. This was initially met with a negative reaction from Seamus Mallon, former Deputy Leader of the SDLP, who stated he would be opposed to any such merger. Former leader of the SDLP Margaret Ritchie originally stated publicly that she opposed any merger, announcing to the Labour Party Conference that such a merger would not happen on her &quot;watch&quot;. On 10 January 2019, Richie stated that she now supported a new partnership with Fianna Fáil.

Both Fianna Fáil and the SDLP currently have shared policies on key areas including addressing the current political situation in Northern Ireland, improving public services in both jurisdictions of Ireland, such as healthcare, housing, education, and governmental reform, and bringing about the further unity and cooperation of the people on the island and arrangements for a future poll on Irish reunification.

In September 2022, SDLP party leader Colum Eastwood announced the end of its partnership with Fianna Fáil, saying that the SDLP needed to move forward by &quot;standing on its own two feet&quot;.

==Representation in European institutions==
Fianna Fáil joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) party on 16 April 2009, and the party&#x27;s Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) sat in the ALDE Group during the 7th European Parliament term from June 2009 to 1 July 2014. The party is a full member of the Liberal International. Prior to this, the party was part of the Eurosceptic Union for Europe of the Nations parliamentary group between 1999 and 2009.

Party headquarters, over the objections of some MEPs, had made several attempts to sever the party&#x27;s links to the European right, including an aborted 2004 agreement to join the European Liberal Democrat and Reform (ELDR) Party, with whom it already sat in the Council of Europe under the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) banner. On 27 February 2009, Taoiseach Brian Cowen announced that Fianna Fáil proposed to join the ELDR Party and intended to sit with them in the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) Group in the European Parliament after the 2009 European elections.

In October 2009, it was reported that Fianna Fáil had irritated its new Liberal colleagues by failing to vote for the motion on press freedom in Italy (resulting in its defeat by a majority of one in the Parliament) and by trying to scupper their party colleagues&#x27; initiative for gay rights. In January 2010, a report by academic experts writing for the votewatch.eu site found that FF &quot;do not seem to toe the political line&quot; of the ALDE Group &quot;when it comes to budget and civil liberties&quot; issues.

In the 2014 European elections, Fianna Fáil received 22.3% of first-preference votes but only returned a single MEP, a reduction in representation of two MEPs from the previous term. This was due to a combination of the party&#x27;s vote further dropping in Dublin and a two candidate strategy in the Midlands North West constituency, which backfired, resulting in sitting MEP Pat &quot;the Cope&quot; Gallagher losing his seat. On 23 June 2014, returning MEP Brian Crowley announced that he intended to sit with the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) rather than the ALDE group during the upcoming 8th term of the European parliament. The following day on 24 June 2014 Crowley had the Fianna Fáil party whip withdrawn. He has since been re-added to Fianna Fáil&#x27;s website.

In the European Committee of the Regions, Fianna Fáil sits in the Renew Europe CoR group, with two full and two alternate members for the 2020–2025 mandate. Kate Feeney is third vice-president of the Group.

<text>The was a powerful family of imperial regents in Japan, descending from the Nakatomi clan and, as legend held, through them their ancestral god Ame-no-Koyane. The Fujiwara prospered since ancient times and dominated the imperial court until the Meiji Restoration in 1868. They held the title of Ason. The abbreviated form is .

The 8th century clan history states the following at the biography of the clan&#x27;s patriarch, Fujiwara no Kamatari (614–669): &quot;Kamatari, the Inner Palace Minister who was also called ‘Chūrō&quot;,&quot;’ was a man of the Takechi district of Yamato Province. His forebears descended from Ame no Koyane no Mikoto; for generations they had administered the rites for Heaven and Earth, harmonizing the space between men and the gods. Therefore, it was ordered their clan was to be called Ōnakatomi&quot;

The clan originated when the founder, Nakatomi no Kamatari (614–669) of the Nakatomi clan, was rewarded by Emperor Tenji with the honorific &quot;Fujiwara&quot;after the wisteria field on Mount Tōno (in present-day Sakurai City) where Kamatari and the then-Prince Naka, whom he befriended in a game of kemari, conspired to eliminate the Soga clan which evolved as a surname for Kamatari and his descendants. In time, Fujiwara became known as a clan name.

The Fujiwara dominated the Japanese politics of the Heian period (794–1185) through the monopoly of regent positions, &quot;Sesshō&quot; and &quot;Kampaku&quot;. The family&#x27;s primary strategy for central influence was through the marrying of Fujiwara daughters to the Emperors. Through this, the Fujiwara would gain influence over the next emperor who would, according to family tradition of that time, be raised in the household of his mother&#x27;s side and owe loyalty to his grandfather. As abdicated emperors took over power by exercising &quot;insei&quot; (, cloistered rule) at the end of the 11th century, then followed by the rise of the warrior class, the Fujiwara gradually lost its control over mainstream politics.

The Northern Fujiwara (Ōshū Fujiwara) ruled the Tōhoku region (northeast Honshū) of Japan during the 12th century.

Beyond the 12th century, they continued to monopolize the titles of &quot;Sesshō&quot; and &quot;Kampaku&quot; for much of the time until the system was abolished in the Meiji era. Though their influence declined, the clan remained close advisors to the succeeding Emperors.

== Asuka and Nara period ==







The Fujiwara clan&#x27;s political influence was initiated during the Asuka period. Nakatomi no Kamatari, a member of the lower-nobility Nakatomi family led a coup against the Soga in 645 and initiated a series of sweeping government reforms that would be known as the Taika Reform. In 668 Emperor Tenji (reigned 668–671), bestowed the &quot;kabane&quot; on Kamatari. The surname passed to the descendants of Fujiwara no Fuhito (659–720), the second son and heir of Kamatari, who was prominent at the court of several emperors and empresses during the early Nara period. He made his daughter Miyako a concubine of Emperor Monmu. Her son, Prince Obito became Emperor Shōmu. Fuhito succeeded in making another of his daughters, Kōmyōshi, the empress consort of Emperor Shōmu. She was the first empress consort of Japan who was not a daughter of the imperial family itself. Fuhito had four sons; and each of them became the progenitor of a cadet branch of the clan: 
* the Hokke or Northern branch founded by Fujiwara no Fusasaki
* the Kyōke branch founded by Fujiwara no Maro
* the Nanke or Southern branch founded by Fujiwara no Muchimaro
* the Shikike branch founded by Fujiwara no Umakai
Among them, the Hokke came to be considered as the leaders of the entire clan. All four brothers died in 737 during a major smallpox epidemic in Japan.

== Heian period ==
During the Heian period of Japanese history, the Hokke managed to establish a hereditary claim to the position of regent, either for an underage emperor (&quot;sesshō&quot;) or for an adult one (&quot;kampaku&quot;). Some prominent Fujiwaras occupied these positions more than once, and for more than one emperor. Lesser members of the Fujiwara were court nobles, provincial governors and vice governors, members of the provincial aristocracy, and samurai. The Fujiwara was one of the four great families that dominated Japanese politics during the Heian Period (794 AC–1185 AC), and the most important of them at that time. The others were the Tachibana, the Taira and the Minamoto. The Fujiwara exercised tremendous power, especially during the period of regency governments in the 10th and 11th centuries, having many emperors as practically puppet monarchs.

The Fujiwara dominated the government of Japan 794–1160. There is no clear starting point of their dominance. However, their domination of civil administration was lost by the establishment of the first shogunate (i.e., Kamakura shogunate) under Minamoto no Yoritomo in 1192.

Fujiwara princes initially served as highest ministers of the imperial Court (&quot;kampaku&quot;) and regents (&quot;sesshō&quot;) for underage monarchs. The Fujiwara were the proverbial &quot;power behind the throne&quot; for centuries. Apparently they never aspired to supplant the imperial dynasty. Instead, the clan&#x27;s influence stemmed from its matrimonial alliances with the imperial family. Because consorts of crown princes, younger sons, and emperors were generally Fujiwara women, the male heads of the Fujiwara house were often the father-in-law, brother-in-law, uncle, or maternal grandfather of the emperor. The family reached the peak of its power under Fujiwara no Michinaga (966–1027). He was the grandfather of three emperors, the father of six empresses or imperial consorts, and the grandfather of seven additional imperial consorts; it is no exaggeration to say that it was Michinaga who ruled Japan during this period, not the titular Emperors. As a result of these unusually strong familial links, Michinaga never took the title of Kampaku—he held more than the power that the position would bring, and had no need of the title.

The Fujiwara clan is featured prominently in &quot;The Pillow Book&quot;, by Sei Shōnagon, and the character of Genji is partially based on Michinaga in the eponymous &quot;Tale of Genji&quot;.

=== Fujiwara regime in the Heian period ===
The Fujiwara Regency was the main feature of government during most of the Heian era. Kyoto (Heian-kyō) was geopolitically a better seat of government; with good river access to the sea, it could be reached by land routes from the eastern provinces.

Just before the move to the Heian-kyō, the Emperor had abolished universal conscription in the eighth century and soon local, private militaries came into being. The Fujiwara and the clans of Taira and Minamoto created later during the ninth century were among the most prominent families supported by the new military class.

In the ninth and tenth centuries, much authority was lost to the great families, who disregarded the Chinese-style land and tax systems imposed by the government in Kyoto. Stability came to Heian Japan, but, even though succession was ensured for the Imperial family through heredity, power again concentrated in the hands of one noble family, the Fujiwara.

Family administrations now became public institutions. As the most powerful family, the Fujiwara governed Japan and determined the general affairs of state, such as succession to the throne. Family and state affairs were thoroughly intermixed, a pattern followed among other families, monasteries, and even the imperial family.

As the Soga had taken control of the throne in the sixth century, the Fujiwara by the ninth century had intermarried with the imperial family, and one of their members was the first head of the Emperor&#x27;s Private Office. While the earliest parts of the Heian period was marked by unusually strong emperors governing themselves (in particular from Emperor Kanmu to Emperor Saga (781–823)), the Fujiwara started to rebuild their influence first under Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu in the first half of the ninth century. Fuyutsugu&#x27;s son Fujiwara no Yoshifusa was the first person not from the imperial family to become regent for a minor emperor when he gained that position when his grandson was enthroned as Emperor Seiwa in 858. His adopted son, Fujiwara no Mototsune, had himself further appointed &quot;kampaku&quot; (regent for an adult emperor, a newly invented position). After Mototsune&#x27;s death Emperor Uda (who was not the son of a Fujiwara daughter) managed to regain control of much of government. However, after abdicating in favour of his son, Emperor Daigo (897–930), while apparently intending to control government from retirement, Mototsune&#x27;s son Fujiwara no Tokihira managed to maneuver himself back to very prominent position until his early death in 909. The remaining period of Daigo&#x27;s reign was again relatively free from Fujiwara dominance, but from the beginning of the reign of his son Emperor Suzaku, the Fujiwara again re-established their dominance of the court with the leadership of Fujiwara no Tadahira.

Nevertheless, the Fujiwara were not demoted by Emperor Daigo but in many ways became stronger during his reign. Central control of Japan had continued to decline, and the Fujiwara, along with other great families and religious foundations, acquired ever larger &quot;shōen&quot; and greater wealth during the early tenth century. By the early Heian period, the &quot;shōen&quot; had obtained legal status, and the large religious establishments sought clear titles in perpetuity, waiver of taxes, and immunity from government inspection of the &quot;shōen&quot; they held. Those people who worked the land found it advantageous to transfer title to shōen holders in return for a share of the harvest. People and lands were increasingly beyond central control and taxation, a de facto return to conditions before the Taika Reform.

Within decades of Emperor Daigo&#x27;s death, the Fujiwara had absolute control over the court. By the year 1000, Fujiwara no Michinaga was able to enthrone and dethrone emperors at will. Little authority was left for traditional officialdom, and government affairs were handled through the Fujiwara family&#x27;s private administration. The Fujiwara had become what historian George B. Sansom has called &quot;hereditary dictators&quot;.

The Fujiwara presided over a period of cultural and artistic flowering at the imperial court and among the aristocracy. There was great interest in graceful poetry and vernacular literature. Japanese writing had long depended on Chinese ideograms (&quot;kanji&quot;), but these were now supplemented by &quot;kana&quot;, two types of phonetic Japanese script: &quot;katakana&quot;, a mnemonic device using parts of Chinese ideograms; and &quot;hiragana&quot;, a cursive form of &quot;kanji&quot; writing and an art form in itself. &quot;Hiragana&quot; gave written expression to the spoken word and, with it, to the rise in Japan&#x27;s famous vernacular literature, much of it written by court women who had not been trained in Chinese as had their male counterparts. Three late tenth century and early eleventh century women presented their views of life and romance at the Heian court in &quot;Kagerō Nikki&quot; (&quot;The Gossamer Years&quot;) by &quot;the mother of Michitsuna&quot;, &quot;Makura no Sōshi&quot; (&quot;The Pillow Book&quot;) by Sei Shōnagon, and &quot;Genji Monogatari&quot; (&quot;Tale of Genji&quot;) by Murasaki Shikibu (herself a Fujiwara). Indigenous art also flourished under the Fujiwara after centuries of imitating Chinese forms. Vividly colored &quot;yamato-e&quot; (Japanese style) paintings of court life and stories about temples and shrines became common in the mid and late Heian periods, setting patterns for Japanese art to this day.

Decline in food production, growth of the population, and competition for resources among the great families all led to the gradual decline of Fujiwara power and gave rise to military disturbances in the mid-tenth and eleventh centuries. Members of the Fujiwara, Taira, and Minamoto familiesall of whom had descended from the imperial familyattacked one another, claimed control over vast tracts of conquered land, set up rival regimes, and generally broke the peace of Japan.

The Fujiwara controlled the throne until the reign of Emperor Go-Sanjō (1068–73), the first emperor not born of a Fujiwara mother since the ninth century. Emperor Go-Sanjō, determined to restore imperial control through strong personal rule, implemented reforms to curb Fujiwara influence. He also established an office to compile and validate estate records with the aim of reasserting central control. Many &quot;shōen&quot; were not properly certified, and large landholders, like the Fujiwara, felt threatened with the loss of their lands. Emperor Go-Sanjō also established the &quot;In no chō&quot;, or Office of the Cloistered Emperor, which was held by a succession of emperors who abdicated to devote themselves to behind-the-scenes governance, or &quot;insei&quot; (Cloistered rule).

The &quot;In no chō&quot; filled the void left by the decline of Fujiwara power. Rather than being banished, the Fujiwara were mostly retained in their old positions of civil dictator and minister of the center while being bypassed in decision making. In time, many of the Fujiwara were replaced, mostly by members of the rising Minamoto family. While the Fujiwara fell into disputes among themselves and formed northern and southern factions, the insei system allowed the paternal line of the imperial family to gain influence over the throne. The period from 1086 to 1156 was the age of supremacy of the &quot;In no chō&quot; and of the rise of the military class throughout the country. Military might rather than civil authority dominated the government.

A struggle for succession in the mid-twelfth century gave the Fujiwara an opportunity to regain their former power. Fujiwara no Yorinaga sided with the retired emperor in a violent battle in 1158 against the heir apparent, who was supported by the Taira and Minamoto. In the end, the Fujiwara were destroyed, the old system of government supplanted, and the &quot;insei&quot; system left powerless as bushi took control of court affairs, marking a turning point in Japanese history. Within a year, the Taira and Minamoto clashed, and a twenty-year period of Taira ascendancy began. The Taira were seduced by court life and ignored problems in the provinces. Finally, Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147–99) rose from his headquarters at Kamakura (in the Kantō region, southwest of modern Tokyo) to defeat the Taira, and with them the child emperor Emperor Antoku they controlled, in the Genpei War (1180–85).

After this downfall, the younger branches of the Fujiwara clan turned their focus from politics to the arts, producing literary scholars including Fujiwara no Shunzei and Fujiwara no Teika.

=== Decline ===
Only forty years after Michinaga&#x27;s death, his Fujiwara heirs were not able to prevent the accession of Emperor Go-Sanjō (reigned 1068–73), the first emperor since Emperor Uda whose mother was not a Fujiwara. The system of government by retired emperor (&quot;daijō tennō&quot;) (cloistered rule) beginning from 1087 further weakened the Fujiwara&#x27;s control over the Imperial Court.

The Fujiwara-dominated Heian period approached its end along disturbances of 12th century. The dynastic struggle known as the Hōgen Disturbance (&quot;Hōgen no Ran&quot;) led to the Taira emerging as the most powerful clan in 1156. During the Heiji Disturbance (&quot;Heiji no Ran&quot;) in 1160 the Taira defeated the coalition of Fujiwara and Minamoto forces. This defeat marked the end of the Fujiwara&#x27;s dominance.

== Split and enduring influence ==
During the 13th century, the Fujiwara Hok-ke was split into five regent houses: Konoe, Takatsukasa, Kujō, Nijō and Ichijō.

They had a &quot;monopoly&quot; to the offices of &quot;sesshō&quot; and &quot;kampaku&quot;, and served in turn. The political power had shifted away from the court nobility in Kyoto to the new warrior class in the countryside. However, Fujiwara remained close advisers, regents and ministers to the emperors for centuries; the family retained political reputation and influence even until the 20th century (such as Fumimaro Konoe and Morihiro Hosokawa, who became the Prime Ministers). As such, they had a certain political power and much influence, as often the rival warriors and later bakufu sought their alliance. Oda Nobunaga and his sister Oichi claimed to have descent from the Taira and Fujiwara clans; regent Toyotomi Hideyoshi and shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu were related by marriage to various families from Fujiwara clan. Empress Shōken, wife of Emperor Meiji, was a descendant of the Fujiwara clan.

Until the marriage of the Crown Prince Hirohito (Emperor Shōwa) to Princess Nagako of Kuni (posthumously Empress Kōjun) in January 1924, the principal consorts of emperors and crown princes had often been recruited from one of the Sekke Fujiwara. Imperial princesses were often married to Fujiwara lordsthroughout a millennium at least. As recently as Emperor Shōwa&#x27;s third daughter, the former Princess Kazuko and Prince Mikasa&#x27;s elder daughter, the former Princess Yasuko, married into Takatsukasa and Konoe families, respectively. Likewise a daughter of the last &quot;shōgun&quot; married a second cousin of Emperor Shōwa.

<doc id="11542" wikidata="Q204886" url="?curid=11542" title="Federalism">
<text>Federalism is a mode of government that combines a general level of government (a central or federal government) with a regional level of sub-unit governments (e.g., provinces, states, cantons, territories, etc.), while dividing the powers of governing between the two levels of governments. Two illustrative examples of federated countries—one of the world&#x27;s oldest federations, and one recently organized—are Australia and the Federated States of Micronesia, (Micronesia).

Johannes Althusius (1563-1638), is considered the father of modern federalism, along with Montesquieu. In 1603, Althusius first described the bases of this political philosophy in his &quot;Politica Methodice Digesta, Atque Exemplis Sacris et Profanis Illustrata&quot;. By 1748, in his treatise &quot;The Spirit of Law&quot;, Montesquieu (1689-1755) observed various examples of federalist governments: in corporate societies, in the &quot;polis&quot; bringing villages together, and in cities themselves forming confederations. In the modern era Federalism was first adopted by a union of the states of the Old Swiss Confederacy as of the mid-14th century.

Federalism differs from confederalism, where the &quot;central government is created subordinate&quot; to the regional states—and is notable for its &quot;regional-separation&quot; of governing powers, (e.g., the Articles of Confederation as the general level of government of the original Thirteen Colonies; and, later in the United States, the Confederate States of America). And federalism also differs from the unitary state, where the &quot;regional level is subordinate&quot; to the central/federal government, even after a devolution of powers—and is notable for &quot;regional-integration of governing powers&quot;, (e.g., the United Kingdom). 

Federalism is at the midpoint of variations on the pathway (or spectrum) of &quot;regional-integration or regional-separation&quot;. It is bordered on the increasing-separation side by confederalism, and on the increasing-integration side by devolution within a unitary state; (see &quot;pathway&quot; graphic).

Some characterize the European Union as a pioneering example of federalism in a multi-state setting—with the concept termed a &quot;federal union of states&quot;, as situated on the &quot;pathway&quot; (sprectrum) of &quot;regional-integration or regional-separation&quot;. 

Examples of federalism today, i.e., the federation of a central/federal government with regional sub-unit governments, include: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Iraq, Malaysia, Mexico, Micronesia, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and Venezuela. 

==Overview==
===Etymology===
The terms &quot;federalism&quot; and &quot;confederalism&quot; share a root in the Latin word &quot;foedus&quot;, meaning &quot;treaty, pact or &quot;. Until the late eighteenth century their two early meanings were essentially the same: a simple league among sovereign states, based on a treaty; (thus, initially the two were synonyms). It was in this sense that James Madison referred to the new US Constitution as &quot;neither a national nor a federal Constitution, but a composition of both&quot;—i.e., constituting neither a single large unitary state nor a league/confederation among several small states, but a hybrid of the two forms—according to Madison; &quot;The Federalist No. 39&quot;. 

Notably, in the course of the nineteenth century in the United States, the meaning of federalism shifted, now referring uniquely to the novel compound-political form established at the Philadelphia Constitution Convention—while the meaning of confederalism remained as a league of states.

===History===
In a narrow sense, federalism refers to the mode in which the body politic of a state is organized internally—and this is the meaning most often used in modern times. Political scientists, however, use the term federalism in a much broader sense, referring instead to a &quot;multi-layer or pluralistic concept of social and political life.&quot;

The first forms of federalism took place in ancient times, in the form of alliances between city states. Some examples from the seventh to second century BC were the Archaic League, the Aetolic League, the Peloponnesian League, and the Delian League. An early ancestor of federalism was the Achaean League in Hellenistic Greece. Unlike the Greek city states of Classical Greece, each of which insisted on keeping its complete independence, changing conditions in the Hellenistic period drove city states to band together even at the cost of surrendering part of their sovereignty. Subsequent unions of states included the first and second Swiss Confederations (1291–1798 and 1815–48); the United Provinces of the Netherlands (1579–1795); the German Bund (1815–66); the first American union, known as the Confederation of the United States of America (1781–89); and the second American union, formed as the United States of America (1789-present).

===Political theory===
Modern federalism is a political system that (nominally) is based upon operating under democratic rules and institutions; and where governing powers are shared between a country&#x27;s national and provincial/state governments. However, the term &quot;federalist&quot; comprises various political practices that differ in important details among the (so-called) federalist nations—some of which are &quot;democratic in name only&quot; (e.g., modern Russia)—leaving the terms &quot;federalist&quot;, &quot;federalism&quot;, &quot;federation&quot;, etc., dependent on context. And, because the term &quot;federalization&quot; also proclaims distinctive political processes, its use also depends on context.

Typically, political theory today discusses two main types of the federalization process:
* integrative, &quot;(or aggregative)&quot; federalization,which encompasses several political processes, including: 1) transforming a confederation into a federation; 2) incorporating non-federated population(s) into an existing federation; or 3) integrating a non-federated population by creating a new or revised federation.
* devolutive, &quot;(or dis-aggregative)&quot; federalization: 1) transforming a unitary state into a federation.

===Reasons for adoption===
According to Daniel Ziblatt, there are four competing theoretical explanations for adopting a federal system:
# Ideational theories, which hold: that among subunit population(s), a greater ideological commitment to decentralist ideas makes federalism more likely to be sought and adopted.
# Cultural-historical theories: that in societies with culturally or ethnically fragmented populations, federalized subunits are more likely to be favored and adopted.
# &quot;Social contract&quot; theories: that federalism emerges via a bargaining process between the center and a periphery (subunit)—where the center is not powerful enough to dominate the periphery, but the periphery is not powerful enough to secede from the center, (e.g., modern Iraq re Kurdistan).
# &quot;Infrastructural power&quot; theories: that federalism is likely to emerge for the subunit population that already has highly developed infrastructures, (e.g., they already are a constitutional, parliamentary, and administratively modernized state).

Immanuel Kant noted that &quot;the problem of setting up a state can be solved even by a nation of devils&quot;—&quot;if&quot; they possess a constitution that pits opposing factions against each other with a durable system of binding checks and balances. Essentially, particular states may use federation as a mechanism (a safeguard) against the possibilities of rebellion or war—or the rise of repressive government via a would-be dictator or a centralized oligarchy.

Proponents of federal systems have historically argued that the structures of checks-and-balances and power-sharing that are inherent in a federal system reduces threats—both foreign and domestic. And federalism enables a state to be &quot;both large and diverse&quot;, by mitigating the risk of a central government turning tyrannical.

==Examples==
Countries around the world have implemented federal systems using variations of central and regional sovereignty for their governments. For convenience of studying these governments, they may be divided according to several categories, such as: &quot;minimalistic&quot; federations, which consist of only two sub-federal units (subunits); as compared to &quot;multi-regional&quot; federations, consisting of three or more regional governments (subunits). Or, based on their body polity type: emirate, provincial, state, republicanism or constitutional monarchy, democratic—or &quot;democratic in-name-only&quot;. And, federal systems may be differentiated between those whose &quot;entire&quot; territory is federated, vs. &quot;only part&quot; of their territory is federated. Some systems are national while others, like the European Union, are supra-national.

Two extremes of federalism are notable: 1) at one extreme, the strong federal state is almost completely unitary, with few powers reserved to local governments; 2) at the opposite extreme, the national government may be a federation in name-only, while actually operating as a confederation, (see &quot;pathway&quot; graphic re regional integration or regional separation). Federalism may encompass as few as two or three internal divisions, as is the case in Belgium or Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In Canada, federalism typically implies opposition to sovereignty movements—most commonly the question of Quebec separatism. In 1999, the Government of Canada established the Forum of Federations as an international network for exchange of best practices among federal and federalizing countries. Headquartered in Ottawa, the Forum of Federations partner governments include Australia, Brazil, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan and Switzerland.

The governments of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, India, and Mexico, among others, are organized along federalist principles.

==Europe vs. the United States==

In Europe, &quot;federalist&quot; is sometimes used to describe those who favor a common federal government, with distributed power at regional, national and supranational levels. The Union of European Federalists advocates for this development within the European Union, ultimately leading to the United States of Europe. Although there are medieval and early modern examples of European states which used confederal and federal systems, contemporary European federalism originated in post-war Europe; one of the more important initiatives was Winston Churchill&#x27;s speech in Zürich in 1946.

In the United States, federalism originally referred to belief in a stronger central government. When the U.S. Constitution was being drafted, the Federalist Party supported a stronger central government, while &quot;Anti-Federalists&quot; wanted a weaker central government. This is very different from the modern usage of &quot;federalism&quot; in Europe and the United States. The distinction stems from the fact that &quot;federalism&quot; is situated in the middle of the political spectrum between a confederacy and a unitary state. The U.S. Constitution was written as a replacement for the Articles of Confederation, under which the United States was a loose confederation with a weak central government.

In contrast, Europe has a greater history of unitary states than North America, thus European &quot;federalism&quot; argues for a weaker central government, relative to a unitary state. The modern American usage of the word is much closer to the European sense. As the power of the U.S. federal government has increased, some people have perceived a much more unitary state than they believe the Founding Fathers intended. Most people politically advocating &quot;federalism&quot; in the United States argue in favor of limiting the powers of the federal government, especially the judiciary (see Federalist Society, New Federalism).

The contemporary concept of federalism came about with the creation of an entirely new system of government that provided for democratic representation at two governing levels simultaneously, which was implemented in the US Constitution. In the United States implementation of federalism, a bicameral general government, consisting of a chamber of popular representation proportional to population (the House of Representatives), and a chamber of equal State-based representation consisting of two delegates per State (the Senate), was overlaid upon the pre-existing regional governments of the thirteen independent States. With each level of government allocated a defined sphere of powers, under a written constitution and the rule of law (that is, subject to the independent third-party arbitration of a supreme court in competence disputes), the two levels were thus brought into a coordinate relationship for the first time.

In 1946, Kenneth Wheare observed that the two levels of government in the US were &quot;co-equally supreme&quot;. In this, he echoed the perspective of American founding father James Madison who saw the several States as forming &quot;distinct and independent portions of the supremacy&quot; in relation to the general government.

== In anarchism ==

In anarchism, federalism is a horizontalist and decentralized organizational doctrine which holds that society should be built from the bottom-up, from the periphery to the centre. Higher-order units are merely the direct expression of lower-order units delegating, combining and coordinating. Though there is no central government or administration, higher-order committees and councils, composed of delegates from federal constituencies, may convene under a popular, revocable mandate.

Embracing the principle of free and voluntary association as the basis of a federal society, constituent entities of an anarchist federation are ideally autonomous and self-determining, collaborating equally, freely and mutually within the federation through the values of solidarity and autonomy.

Unlike a republican federation, federalism, in anarchy, is not simply a form of political division or devolution, but rather, federative principles apply to all aspects of society, including social relations and the economy. Consequently, anarchist federalism, promoting widespread, common ownership over the means of production, detests the centralized and unequal nature of capitalism, and the hierarchy of its companies and corporations: an anarchist federalist society would envisage widespread, federalized wealth distribution.

Comparing republican and anarchist federalism, James Guillaume states that Switzerland&#x27;s federative cantonal system, despite its direct democracy, differs significantly from anarchist federalism: while Swiss federalism retains a state and provides only limited regional sovereignty, anarchist federalism as envisioned by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is stateless, providing every autonomy with absolute sovereignty and distinct individuality. The Swiss constitution, in its support of and nationhood and its view that its cantons are mere territorial divisions rather than sovereign constituencies, is incompatible with anarchist federalism and its principles of free association, decentralization and autonomy.

Anarchist federalism is a rejection of the statism and nationalism present in modern federations, and instead provides an alternative system of federative organization founded on stateless individuality and autonomy. For anarchists, republican federalism is as oppressive as a centralized, unitary state, for all it is perceived to accomplish is delegate and transfer the perceived oppression of a state to local levels and jurisdictions.

==Constitutional structure==
===Division of powers===

In a federation, the division of power between federal and regional governments is usually outlined in the constitution. Almost every country allows some degree of regional self-government, but in federations the right to self-government of the component states is constitutionally entrenched. Component states often also possess their own constitutions which they may amend as they see fit, although in the event of conflict the federal constitution usually takes precedence.

In almost all federations the central government enjoys the powers of foreign policy and national defense as exclusive federal powers. Were this not the case a federation would not be a single sovereign state, per the UN definition. Notably, the states of Germany retain the right to act on their own behalf at an international level, a condition originally granted in exchange for the Kingdom of Bavaria&#x27;s agreement to join the German Empire in 1871. The constitutions of Germany and the United States provide that all powers not specifically granted to the federal government are retained by the states. The Constitution of some countries, like Canada and India, state that powers not explicitly granted to the provincial/state governments are retained by the federal government. Much like the US system, the Australian Constitution allocates to the Federal government (the Commonwealth of Australia) the power to make laws about certain specified matters which were considered too difficult for the States to manage, so that the States retain all other areas of responsibility. Under the division of powers of the European Union in the Lisbon Treaty, powers which are not either exclusively of or shared between the Union and the Member States as concurrent powers are retained by the constituent States.
Where every component state of a federation possesses the same powers, we are said to find &#x27;symmetric federalism&#x27;. Asymmetric federalism exists where states are granted different powers, or some possess greater autonomy than others do. This is often done in recognition of the existence of a distinct culture in a particular region or regions. In Spain, the Basques and Catalans, as well as the Galicians, spearheaded a historic movement to have their national specificity recognized, crystallizing in the &quot;historical communities&quot; such as Navarre, Galicia, Catalonia, and the Basque Country. They have more powers than the later expanded arrangement for other Spanish regions, or the Spain of the autonomous communities (called also the &quot;coffee for everyone&quot; arrangement), partly to deal with their separate identity and to appease peripheral nationalist leanings, partly out of respect to specific rights they had held earlier in history. However, strictly speaking Spain is not a federation, but a system of asymmetric devolved government within a unitary state.

It is common that during the historical evolution of a federation there is a gradual movement of power from the component states to the centre, as the federal government acquires additional powers, sometimes to deal with unforeseen circumstances. The acquisition of new powers by a federal government may occur through formal constitutional amendment or simply through a broadening of the interpretation of a government&#x27;s existing constitutional powers given by the courts.

Usually, a federation is formed at two levels: the central government and the regions (states, provinces, territories), and little to nothing is said about second or third level administrative political entities. Brazil is an exception, because the 1988 Constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite, encompassing the Union, the States, and the municipalities. Each state is divided into municipalities (&quot;municípios&quot;) with their own legislative council (&quot;câmara de vereadores&quot;) and a mayor (&quot;prefeito&quot;), which are partly autonomous from both Federal and State Government. Each municipality has a &quot;little constitution&quot;, called &quot;organic law&quot; (&quot;lei orgânica&quot;). Mexico is an intermediate case, in that municipalities are granted full-autonomy by the federal constitution and their existence as autonomous entities (&quot;municipio libre&quot;, &quot;free municipality&quot;) is established by the federal government and cannot be revoked by the states&#x27; constitutions. Moreover, the federal constitution determines which powers and competencies belong exclusively to the municipalities and not to the constituent states. However, municipalities do not have an elected legislative assembly.

Federations often employ the paradox of being a union of states, while still being states (or having aspects of statehood) in themselves. For example, James Madison (author of the United States Constitution) wrote in Federalist Paper No. 39 that the US Constitution &quot;is in strictness neither a national nor a federal constitution; but a composition of both. In its foundation, it is federal, not national; in the sources from which the ordinary powers of the Government are drawn, it is partly federal, and partly national...&quot; This stems from the fact that states in the US maintain all sovereignty that they do not yield to the federation by their own consent. This was reaffirmed by the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which reserves all powers and rights that are not delegated to the Federal Government as left to the States and to the people.

===Bicameralism===
The structures of most federal governments incorporate mechanisms to protect the rights of component states. One method, known as &#x27;intrastate federalism&#x27;, is to directly represent the governments of component states in federal political institutions. Where a federation has a bicameral legislature the upper house is often used to represent the component states while the lower house represents the people of the nation as a whole. A federal upper house may be based on a special scheme of apportionment, as is the case in the senates of the United States and Australia, where each state is represented by an equal number of senators irrespective of the size of its population.

Alternatively, or in addition to this practice, the members of an upper house may be indirectly elected by the government or legislature of the component states, as occurred in the United States prior to 1913, or be actual members or delegates of the state governments, as, for example, is the case in the German Bundesrat and in the Council of the European Union. The lower house of a federal legislature is usually directly elected, with apportionment in proportion to population, although states may sometimes still be guaranteed a certain minimum number of seats.

===Intergovernmental relations===
In Canada, the provincial governments represent regional interests and negotiate directly with the central government. A First Ministers conference of the prime minister and the provincial premiers is the &quot;de facto&quot; highest political forum in the land, although it is not mentioned in the constitution.

===Constitutional change===
Federations often have special procedures for amendment of the federal constitution. As well as reflecting the federal structure of the state this may guarantee that the self-governing status of the component states cannot be abolished without their consent. An amendment to the constitution of the United States must be ratified by three-quarters of either the state legislatures, or of constitutional conventions specially elected in each of the states, before it can come into effect. In referendums to amend the constitutions of Australia and Switzerland it is required that a proposal be endorsed not just by an overall majority of the electorate in the nation as a whole, but also by separate majorities in each of a majority of the states or cantons. In Australia, this latter requirement is known as a &quot;double majority&quot;.

Some federal constitutions also provide that certain constitutional amendments cannot occur without the unanimous consent of all states or of a particular state. The US constitution provides that no state may be deprived of equal representation in the senate without its consent. In Australia, if a proposed amendment will specifically impact one or more states, then it must be endorsed in the referendum held in each of those states. Any amendment to the Canadian constitution that would modify the role of the monarchy would require unanimous consent of the provinces. The German Basic Law provides that no amendment is admissible at all that would abolish the federal system.

===Other technical terms===
* Fiscal federalism – the relative financial positions and the financial relations between the levels of government in a federal system.
* Formal federalism (or &#x27;constitutional federalism&#x27;) – the delineation of powers is specified in a written constitution, which may or may not correspond to the actual operation of the system in practice.
* Executive federalism refers in the English-speaking tradition to the intergovernmental relationships between the executive branches of the levels of government in a federal system and in the continental European tradition to the way constituent units &#x27;execute&#x27; or administer laws made centrally.
* Gleichschaltung – the conversion from a federal governance to either a completely unitary or more unitary one, the term was borrowed from the German for conversion from alternating to direct current. During the Nazi era the traditional German states were mostly left intact in the formal sense, but their constitutional rights and sovereignty were eroded and ultimately ended and replaced with the Gau system. &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; also has a broader sense referring to political consolidation in general.
* defederalize – to remove from federal government, such as taking a responsibility from a national level government and giving it to states or provinces.

==In relation to conflict==
It has been argued that federalism and other forms of territorial autonomy are a useful way to structure political systems in order to prevent violence among different groups within countries because it allows certain groups to legislate at the subnational level. Some scholars have suggested, however, that federalism can divide countries and result in state collapse because it creates proto-states. Still others have shown that federalism is only divisive when it lacks mechanisms that encourage political parties to compete across regional boundaries.

Federalism is sometimes viewed in the context of international negotiation as &quot;the best system for integrating diverse nations, ethnic groups, or combatant parties, all of whom may have cause to fear control by an overly powerful center.&quot; However, those skeptical of federal prescriptions sometimes believe that increased regional autonomy can lead to secession or dissolution of the nation. In Syria, for example, federalization proposals have failed in part because &quot;Syrians fear that these borders could turn out to be the same as the ones that the fighting parties have currently carved out.&quot;

<text>Firmin Abauzit (11 November 167920 March 1767) was a French scholar who worked on physics, theology and philosophy, and served as librarian in Geneva (Republic of Geneva) during his final 40 years. Abauzit is also notable for proofreading or correcting the writings of Isaac Newton and other scholars.

==Biography==
Firmin Abauzit was born of Huguenot parents on 11 November 1679 at Uzès, in Languedoc. His paternal family traces its origin to an Arab physician who settled in Toulouse during the 9th century. Accordingly, the name “Abauzit” is liked derived from the Arabic “Abu Zaid” (father of Zaid).

His father died when he was only two years of age; and when, on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, the authorities took steps to have him educated in the Roman Catholic faith, his mother contrived his escape.

For two years his brother and he lived as fugitives in the mountains of the Cévennes, but they at last reached Geneva, where their mother afterwards joined them on escaping from the imprisonment in which she was held from the time of their flight. Abauzit at an early age acquired great proficiency in languages, physics, and theology.

In 1698, he traveled to Germany, then to Holland, where he became acquainted with Pierre Bayle, Pierre Jurieu and Jacques Basnage. Proceeding to England, he was introduced to Sir Isaac Newton, who found in him one of the earliest defenders of his discoveries against Castel. Newton corrected in the second edition of his &quot;Principia&quot; an error pointed out by Abauzit, and, when sending him the &quot;Commercium Epistolicum,&quot; said, &quot;You are well worthy to judge between Leibnitz and me.&quot;

The reputation of Abauzit induced William III to request him to settle in England, but he did not accept the king&#x27;s offer, preferring to return to Geneva.
There from 1715 he rendered valuable assistance to a society that had been formed for translating the New Testament into French. He declined the offer of the chair of philosophy at the University of Geneva in 1723. He assisted in the French language New Testament in 1726. In 1727, he was granted citizenship in Geneva, and he accepted the office of honorary librarian to Geneva, the city of his adoption. It was while he was in Geneva in his later years that he authored many of his works. He died in Geneva at the age of 87, on 20 March 1767.

==Legacy==
Abauzit was a man of great learning and of wonderful versatility. Whatever chanced to be discussed, it used to be said of Abauzit that he seemed to have made it a subject of particular study. Rousseau, who was jealously sparing of his praises, addressed to him, in his &quot;Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse&quot;, a fine panegyric; and when a stranger flatteringly told Voltaire he had come to see a great man, the philosopher asked him if he had seen Abauzit. Among his acquaintances, Abauzit claimed Rousseau, Voltaire, Newton, and Bayle.

Little remains of the labours of this intellectual giant, his heirs having, it is said, destroyed the papers that came into their possession, because their own religious opinions were different. A few theological, archaeological, and astronomical articles from his pen appeared in the &quot;Journal helvétique&quot; and elsewhere, and he contributed several papers to Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire de musique&quot; (1767). He wrote a work throwing doubt on the canonical authority of the Apocalypse, which called forth a reply from Dr Leonard Twells, and was published in Denis Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;. He also edited and made valuable additions to Jacob Spon&#x27;s &quot;Histoire de la république de Genève&quot;. A collection of his writings was published at Geneva in 1770 (&quot;Œuvres de feu M. Abauzit&quot;), and another at London in 1773 (&quot;Œuvres diverses de M. Abauzit&quot;).

<text>The French Foreign Legion (, also known simply as , &quot;the Legion&quot;) is a corps of the French Army created to allow foreign nationals into French service. The Legion was founded in 1831 and today consists of several specialties, namely infantry, cavalry, engineers, and airborne troops. It formed part of the Armée d&#x27;Afrique, French Army units associated with France&#x27;s colonial project in North Africa, until the end of the Algerian War in 1962.

Legionnaires are today renowned as highly trained soldiers whose training focuses on traditional military skills and on the Legion&#x27;s strong &quot;esprit de corps&quot;, as its men come from different countries with different cultures. Consequently, training is often described as not only physically challenging, but also very stressful psychologically. Legionnaires may apply for French citizenship after three years&#x27; service, or immediately after being wounded in the line of duty: This latter provision is known as &quot;&quot; (&quot;French by spilled blood&quot;).

== History ==
The Foreign Legion was created by Louis Philippe, the King of the French, on 10 March 1831 to allow the incorporation of foreign nationals into the French Army from the foreign regiments of the Kingdom of France. Recruits included soldiers from the recently disbanded Swiss and German foreign regiments of the Bourbon monarchy. The Royal Ordinance for the establishment of the new regiment specified that the foreigners recruited could only serve outside France. The French expeditionary force that had occupied Algiers in 1830 was in need of reinforcements, and the Legion was accordingly transferred by sea in detachments from Toulon to Algeria.
Since its establishment in 1831, the Legion has consisted of hundreds of thousands in active service at its peak, and suffered the aggregated loss of nearly 40,000 men in France, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Madagascar, West Africa, Mexico, Italy, Crimea, Spain, Indo-China, Norway, Syria, Chad, Zaïre, Lebanon, Central Africa, Gabon, Kuwait, Rwanda, Djibouti, former Yugoslavia, Somalia, the Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast, Afghanistan, Mali, as well as others. The Legion was primarily used to help protect and expand the French colonial empire during the 19th century. The Foreign Legion was initially stationed only in Algeria, where it took part in the Algerian genocide and destruction of the natural habitat of the colony. Subsequently, the Foreign Legion was deployed in a number of conflicts, including the First Carlist War in 1835, the Crimean War in 1854, the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, the French intervention in Mexico in 1863, the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, the Tonkin Campaign and Sino-French War in 1883, supporting growth of the French colonial empire in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Second Franco-Dahomean War in 1892, the Second Madagascar expedition in 1895 and the Mandingo Wars in 1894. In World War I, the Foreign Legion fought in many critical battles on the Western Front. It played a smaller role in World War II than in World War I, however, participated in the Norwegian, Syrian and North African campaigns. During the First Indochina War (1946–1954), the Foreign Legion saw its numbers swell. In Vietnam, the Legion lost a large number of men in the catastrophic Battle of Dien Bien Phu against forces of the Viet Minh.

Subsequent military campaigns included those during the Suez Crisis, the Battle of Algiers and various offensives in Algeria launched by General Maurice Challe including Operation Oranie and Operation Jumelles. During the Algerian War of Independence (1954–1962), the Foreign Legion came close to being disbanded after some officers, men, and the highly decorated 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP) took part in the Generals&#x27; putsch. In the 1960s and 1970s, Legion regiments had additional roles in sending units as a rapid deployment force to preserve French interests – in its former African colonies and in other nations as well; it also returned to its roots of being a unit always ready to be sent to conflict zones around the world.

Some notable operations include the Chadian–Libyan conflict in 1969–1972 (the first time that the Legion was sent in operations after the Algerian War), 1978–1979, and 1983–1987; Kolwezi in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo in May 1978. In 1981, the 1st Foreign Regiment and Foreign Legion regiments took part in the Multinational Force in Lebanon. In 1990, Foreign Legion regiments were sent to the Persian Gulf and participated in Opération Daguet, part of Division Daguet. Following the Gulf War in the 1990s, the Foreign Legion helped with the evacuation of French citizens and foreigners in Rwanda, Gabon and Zaire. The Foreign Legion was also deployed to Cambodia, Somalia, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the mid-to late 1990s, the Foreign Legion was deployed to the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville and in Kosovo. The French Foreign Legion also took part in operations in Rwanda in 1990–1994; and the Ivory Coast from 2002 to the present. In the 2000s, the Foreign Legion was deployed to Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, Opération Licorne in Ivory Coast, the EUFOR Tchad/RCA in Chad, and Operation Serval in the Northern Mali conflict. 

As discussed below, other countries have attempted to emulate the French Foreign Legion model. The Foreign Legion was primarily used, as part of the &quot;Armée d&#x27;Afrique&quot;, to protect and expand the French colonial empire during the 19th century, but it also fought in almost all French wars including the Franco-Prussian War, World War I and World War II. The Foreign Legion has remained an important part of the French Army, and sea transport protected by the French Navy survived three Republics, the Second French Empire, two World Wars, the rise and fall of mass conscript armies, the dismantling of the French colonial empire, and the loss of the Foreign Legion&#x27;s base, Algeria.

===Conquest of Algeria 1830–1847===
Created to fight &quot;outside mainland France&quot;, the Foreign Legion was stationed in Algeria, where it took part in the Algerian genocide and destruction of the natural habitat of the colony, notably by drying the marshes in the region of Algiers. The Foreign Legion was initially divided into six &quot;national battalions&quot; (Swiss, Poles, Germans, Italians, Spanish, and Dutch-Belgian). Smaller national groups, such as ten Englishmen recorded in December 1832, appear to have been placed randomly.

In late 1831, the first legionnaires landed in Algeria, the country that shaped its character and became the Foreign Legion&#x27;s homeland for 130 years. The early years in Algeria were hard on the legion because it was often sent to the worst postings and received the worst assignments, and its members were generally uninterested in the new colony of the French. The Legion served alongside the Battalions of Light Infantry of Africa, formed in 1832, which was a penal military unit made up of men with prison records who still had to do their military service or soldiers with serious disciplinary problems.

The Foreign Legion&#x27;s first service in Algeria came to an end after only four years, as it was needed elsewhere.

===Carlist War 1835–1839===
The French government sent the Foreign Legion to Spain to support Isabella II&#x27;s claim to the Spanish throne against her uncle. On 28 June 1835, the unit was handed over to the Spanish government. The Foreign Legion landed via sea at Tarragona on 17 August with around 1,400 who were quickly dubbed &quot;Los Argelinos&quot; (the Algerians) by locals because of their previous posting.

The Foreign Legion&#x27;s commander immediately dissolved the national battalions to improve the &quot;esprit de corps&quot;. Later, he also created three squadrons of lancers and an artillery battery from the existing force to increase independence and flexibility. The Foreign Legion was dissolved on 8 December 1838, when it had dropped to only 500 men. The survivors returned to France, many reenlisting in the new Foreign Legion along with many of their former Carlist enemies.

===Crimean War===
On 9 June 1854, the French ship &quot;Jean Bart&quot; embarked four battalions of the Foreign Legion for the Crimean Peninsula. A further battalion was stationed at Gallipoli as brigade depot. Eight companies drawn from both regiments of the Foreign Legion took part in the Battle of Alma (20 September 1854). Reinforcements by sea brought the Legion contingent up to brigade strength. As the &quot;Foreign Brigade&quot;, it served in the Siege of Sevastopol, during the winter of 1854–1855. 

The lack of equipment was particularly challenging and cholera hit the Allied expeditionary force. Nevertheless, the &quot;leather bellies&quot; (the nickname given to the legionnaires by the Russians because of the large cartridge pouches that they wore attached to their waist-belts), performed well. On 21 June 1855, the Third Battalion, left Corsica for Crimea.

On 8 September the final assault was launched on Sevastopol. Two days later, the Second Foreign Regiment with flags and band playing ahead, marched through the streets of Sevastopol. Although initial reservations had been expressed about whether the Legion should be used outside Africa, the Crimean experience established its suitability for service in European warfare, as well as making a cohesive single entity of what had previously been two separate foreign regiments. Legion casualties in the Crimea were 1,703 killed and wounded out of total French losses by battle and disease of 95,615.

===Italian Campaign 1859===
Like the rest of the &quot;Army of Africa&quot;, the Foreign Legion provided detachments in the campaign of Italy. Two foreign regiments, grouped with the 2nd Regiment of Zouaves, were part of the Second Brigade of the Second Division of Mac Mahon&#x27;s Corps. The Foreign Legion acquitted itself particularly well against the Austrians at the battle of Magenta (4 June 1859) and at the Battle of Solferino (24 June). Legion losses were significant and the 2nd Foreign Regiment lost Colonel Chabrière, its commanding officer. In gratitude, the city of Milan awarded, in 1909, the &quot;commemorative medal of deliverance&quot;, which still adorns the regimental flags of the Second Regiment.

===Mexican Expedition 1863–1867===


The 38,000 strong French expeditionary force dispatched to Mexico via sea between 1862 and 1863 included two battalions of the Foreign Legion, increased to six battalions by 1866. Small cavalry and artillery units were raised from legionnaires serving in Mexico. The original intention was that Foreign Legion units should remain in Mexico for up to six years to provide a core for the Imperial Mexican Army. However the Legion was withdrawn with the other French forces during February–March 1867.

It was in Mexico on 30 April 1863 that the Legion earned its legendary status. A company led by Captain Jean Danjou, numbering 62 Legionnaires and 3 Legion officers, was escorting a convoy to the besieged city of Puebla when it was attacked and besieged by three thousand Mexican loyalists, organised in two battalions of infantry and cavalry, numbering 2,200 and 800 respectively. The Legion detachment under Danjou, Sous-Lieutenant , and Sous-Lieutenant made a stand in the &quot;Hacienda de la Trinidad&quot; – a farm near the village of Camarone. When only six survivors remained, out of ammunition, a bayonet assault was launched in which three of the six were killed. The remaining three wounded men were brought before the Mexican commander Colonel Milán, who allowed them to return to the French lines as an honor guard for the body of Danjou. The captain had a wooden hand, which was later returned to the Legion and is now kept in a case in the Legion Museum at Aubagne and paraded annually on Camerone Day. It is the Foreign Legion&#x27;s most precious relic.

During the Mexican Campaign, 6,654 French died. Of these, 1,918 were from a single regiment of the Legion.

===Franco-Prussian War 1870===
According to French law, the Foreign Legion was not to be used within Metropolitan France except in the case of a national invasion, and was consequently not a part of Napoleon III&#x27;s Imperial Army that capitulated at Sedan. With the defeat of the Imperial Army, the Second French Empire fell and the Third Republic was created.

The new Third Republic was desperately short of trained soldiers following Sedan, so the Foreign Legion was ordered to provide a contingent. On 11 October 1870 two provisional battalions disembarked via sea at Toulon, the first time the Foreign Legion had been deployed in France itself. It attempted to lift the Siege of Paris by breaking through the German lines. It succeeded in retaking Orléans, but failed to break the siege. In January 1871, France capitulated but civil war soon broke out, which led to revolution and the short-lived Paris Commune. The Foreign Legion participated in the suppression of the Commune, which was crushed with great bloodshed.

===Tonkin Campaign and Sino-French War 1883–1888===


The Foreign Legion&#x27;s First Battalion (Lieutenant-Colonel Donnier) sailed to Tonkin in late 1883, during the period of undeclared hostilities that preceded the Sino-French War (August 1884 to April 1885), and formed part of the attack column that stormed the western gate of Sơn Tây on 16 December. The Second and Third Infantry Battalions (&quot;chef de bataillon&quot; Diguet and Lieutenant-Colonel Schoeffer) were also deployed to Tonkin shortly afterwards, and were present in all the major campaigns of the Sino-French War. Two Foreign Legion companies led the defence at the celebrated Siege of Tuyên Quang (24 November 1884 to 3 March 1885). In January 1885 the Foreign Legion&#x27;s 4th Battalion (&quot;chef de bataillon&quot; Vitalis) was deployed to the French bridgehead at Keelung (Jilong) in Formosa (Taiwan), where it took part in the later battles of the Keelung Campaign. The battalion played an important role in Colonel Jacques Duchesne&#x27;s offensive in March 1885 that captured the key Chinese positions of La Table and Fort Bamboo and disengaged Keelung.

In December 1883, during a review of the Second Legion Battalion on the eve of its departure for Tonkin to take part in the Bắc Ninh Campaign, General François de Négrier pronounced a famous &quot;mot&quot;: &quot;Vous, légionnaires, vous êtes soldats pour mourir, et je vous envoie où l&#x27;on meurt!&quot; (&#x27;You, Legionnaires, you are soldiers in order to die, and I&#x27;m sending you to where one dies!&#x27;)

===Colonization of Africa===
As part of the Army of Africa, the Foreign Legion contributed to the expansion of the French colonial empire in Sub-Saharan Africa. Simultaneously, the Legion took part to the pacification of Algeria, suppressing various tribal rebellions and razzias.

====Second Franco-Dahomean War 1892–1894====
In 1892, King Béhanzin ordered his soldiers to attack villages near Grand Popo and Porto-Novo (in modern-day Benin) in an effort to reassert the older boundaries of Dahomey. King Béhanzin rejected complaints by the French, who proceeded to declare war

A battalion, led by commandant Faurax Montier, was formed from two companies of the First Foreign Regiment and two others from the second regiment. From Cotonou, the legionnaires marched to seize Abomey, the capital of the Kingdom of Dahomey. Two and a half months were needed to reach the city, at the cost of repeated battles against the Dahomean warriors, especially the Amazons of the King. King Behanzin surrendered and was captured by the legionnaires in January 1894.

====Second Madagascar Expedition 1894–1895====
In 1895, a battalion formed by the First and Second Foreign Regiments was sent to the Kingdom of Madagascar as part of an expeditionary force whose mission was to conquer the island. The foreign battalion formed the backbone of the column launched on Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar. After a few skirmishes, Queen Ranavalona III promptly surrendered. The Foreign Legion lost 226 men, only a tenth of whom died during actual combat. Others, like much of the expeditionary force, died from tropical diseases. Despite the success of the expedition, the quelling of sporadic rebellions would take another eight years until 1905, when the island was completely pacified by the French under Joseph Gallieni. During that time, insurrections against the Malagasy Christians of the island, missionaries and foreigners were particularly terrible. Queen Ranavalona III was deposed in January 1897 and was exiled to Algiers in Algeria, where she died in 1917.

====Mandingo War 1898====
From 1882 until his capture, Samori Ture, ruler of the Wassoulou Empire, fought the French colonial army, defeating them on several occasions, including a notable victory at Woyowayanko (2 April 1882), in the face of French heavy artillery. Nonetheless, Samori was forced to sign several treaties ceding territory to the French between 1886 and 1889. Samori began a steady retreat, but the fall of other resistance armies, particularly Babemba Traoré at Sikasso, permitted the colonial army to launch a concentrated assault against his forces. A battalion of two companies from the 2nd Foreign Regiment was created in early 1894 to pacify the Niger. The Legionnaires&#x27; victory at the fortress of Ouilla and police patrols in the region accelerated the submission of the tribes. On 29 September 1898, Samori Ture was captured by the French Commandant Gouraud and exiled to Gabon, marking the end of the Wassoulou Empire.

===Marching Regiments of the Foreign Legion===


====World War I 1914–1918====


The annexation of Alsace and Lorraine by Germany in 1871 led to numerous volunteers from the two regions enlisting in the Foreign Legion, which gave them the option of French citizenship at the end of their service.

With the declaration of war on 29 July 1914, a call was made for foreigners residing in France to support their adopted country. While many would have preferred direct enlistment in the regular French Army, the only option immediately available was that of the Foreign Legion. On 3 August 1914 a reported 8,000 volunteers applied to enlist in the Paris recruiting office of the Legion.

In World War I, the Foreign Legion fought in many critical battles on the Western Front, including Artois, Champagne, Somme, Aisne, and Verdun (in 1917), and also suffered heavy casualties during 1918. The Foreign Legion was also in the Dardanelles and Macedonian front, and was highly decorated for its efforts. Many young foreigners volunteered for the Foreign Legion when the war broke out in 1914. There were marked differences between the idealistic volunteers of 1914 and the hardened men of the old Legion, making assimilation difficult. Nevertheless, the old and the new men of the Foreign Legion fought and died in vicious battles on the Western front, including Belloy-en-Santerre during the Battle of the Somme, where the poet Alan Seeger, after being mortally wounded by machine-gun fire, cheered on the rest of his advancing battalion.

====Interwar period 1918–1939====

While suffering heavy casualties on the Western Front the Legion had emerged from World War I with an enhanced reputation and as one of the most highly decorated units in the French Army. In 1919, the government of Spain raised the Spanish Foreign Legion and modeled it after the French Foreign Legion. General Jean Mordacq intended to rebuild the Foreign Legion as a larger military formation, doing away with the legion&#x27;s traditional role as a solely infantry formation. General Mordacq envisioned a Foreign Legion consisting not of regiments, but of divisions with cavalry, engineer, and artillery regiments in addition to the legion&#x27;s infantry mainstay. In 1920, decrees ordained the establishment of regiments of cavalry and artillery. Immediately following the armistice the Foreign Legion experienced an increase of enlistments. The Foreign Legion began the process of reorganizing and redeploying to Algeria.

The Legion played a major part in the Rif War of 1920–25. In 1932, the Foreign Legion consisted of 30,000 men, serving in six multi-battalion regiments including the 1st Foreign Infantry Regiment 1er REI – Algeria, Syria and Lebanon; 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment 2ème REI, 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment 3ème REI, and 4th Foreign Infantry Regiment 4ème REI – Morocco, Lebanon; 5th Foreign Infantry 5ème REI – Indochina; and 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment 1er REC – Lebanon, Tunisia and Morocco.
In 1931, Général Paul-Frédéric Rollet assumed the role of 1st Inspector of the Foreign Legion, a post created at his initiative. While serving as colonel of the 1st Foreign Infantry Regiment (1925–1931), Rollet was responsible for planning the centennial celebrations of the Legion&#x27;s foundation; scheduling this event for Camarón Day 30 April 1931. He was subsequently credited with creating much of the modern mystique of the Legion by restoring or creating many of its traditions.

====World War II 1939–1945====


The Foreign Legion played a smaller role in World War II in mainland Europe than in World War I, though it saw involvement in many exterior theatres of operations, notably sea-transport protection through to the Norwegian, Syria-Lebanon, and North African campaigns. The 13th Demi-Brigade, formed for service in Norway, found itself in the UK at the time of the French Armistice (June 1940), was deployed to the British 8th Army in North Africa and distinguished itself in the Battle of Bir Hakeim (1942). Reflecting the divisions of the time, part of the Foreign Legion joined the Free French movement while another part served the Vichy government. Germany incorporated German legionnaires into the Wehrmacht&#x27;s 90th Light Infantry Division in North Africa.

The Syria–Lebanon Campaign of June 1941 saw legionnaire fighting legionnaire as the 13e D.B.L.E clashed with the 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment 6e REI at Damascus. Nevertheless, many legionnaires of the 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment 6e (dissolved on 31 December 1941) integrated into the Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion R.M.L.E in 1942. Later, a thousand of the rank-and-file of the Vichy Legion unit joined the 13e D.B.L.E. of the Free French forces which were also part (as of September 1944) of Jean de Lattre de Tassigny&#x27;s successful amalgam of the French Liberation Army (), the (400,000 men) amalgam consisted of the Armistice Army, the Free French Forces and the French Forces of the Interior which formed Army B and later became part of the French 1st Army with forces also issued from the French Resistance.

==== Alsace-Lorraine ====
Following World War II, many French-speaking former German soldiers joined the Foreign Legion to pursue a military career, an option no longer possible in Germany, including French German soldiers of Malgré-nous. It would have been considered problematic if the men from Alsace-Lorraine had not spoken French. These French-speaking former German soldiers made up as much as 60 percent of the Legion during the war in Indochina. Contrary to popular belief however, French policy was to exclude former members of the Waffen-SS, and candidates for induction were refused if they exhibited the tell-tale blood type tattoo, or even a scar that might be masking it.

The high percentage of Germans was contrary to normal policy concerning a single dominant nationality, and in more recent times Germans have made up a much smaller percentage of the Foreign Legion&#x27;s composition.

===First Indochina War 1946–1954===


During the First Indochina War (1946–54) the Foreign Legion saw its numbers swell due to the incorporation of World War II veterans. Although the Foreign Legion distinguished itself in a territory where it had served since the 1880s, it also suffered a heavy toll during this war. Some of the legionnaires, such as Stefan Kubiak, deserted and began fighting for the Việt Minh upon witnessing torture of Vietnamese peasants at the hands of French troops. Constantly being deployed in operations, units of the Legion suffered particularly heavy losses in the climactic Battle of Dien Bien Phu, before the fortified valley finally fell on 7 May 1954.

No fewer than 72,833 served in Indochina during the eight-year war. The Legion suffered the loss of 10,283 of its own men in combat: 309 officers, 1082 sous-officiers and 9092 legionnaires. While only one of several Legion units involved in Indochina, the 1st Foreign Parachute Battalion (1er BEP) particularly distinguished itself, while being annihilated twice. It was renamed the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP) after its third reformation.

The 1er BEP sailed to Indochina on 12 November and was then engaged in combat operations in Tonkin. On 17 November 1950 the battalion parachuted into That Khé and suffered heavy losses at Coc Xa. Reconstituted on 1 March 1951, the battalion participated in combat operations at Cho Ben, on the Black River and in Annam. On 21 November 1953 the reconstituted 1er BEP was parachuted into Dien Bien Phu. In this battle, the unit lost 575 killed and missing. Reconstituted for the third time on 19 May 1954, the battalion left Indochina on 8 February 1955. The 1er BEP received five citations and the fourragère of the colors of the Médaille militaire for its service in Indochina. The 1er BEP became the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP) in Algeria on 1 September 1955.
Dien Bien Phu fell on 7 May 1954 at 17:30. The couple of hectares that were the battlefield today are corn fields surrounding a stele which commemorates the sacrifices of those who died there. While the garrison of Dien Bien Phu included French regular, North African, and locally recruited (Indochinese) units, the battle has become associated particularly with the paratroops of the Foreign Legion.

During the Indochina War, the Legion operated several armoured trains which were an enduring &quot;Rolling Symbol&quot; during the chartered course duration of French Indochina. The Legion also operated various Passage Companies relative to the continental conflicts at hand.

===Algerian War 1954–1962===

==== Foreign Legion paratroops ====


The legion was heavily engaged in fighting against the National Liberation Front and the Armée de Libération Nationale (ALN). The main activity during the period 1954–1962 was as part of the operations of the 10th Parachute Division and 25th Parachute Division. The 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment, 1er REP, was under the command of the 10th Parachute Division (France), 10ème DP, and the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment, 2ème REP, was under the command of the 25th Parachute Division (France), 25ème DP. While both the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP), and the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment (2ème REP), were part of the operations of French parachute divisions (10ème DP and 25ème DP established in 1956), the Legion&#x27;s 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP), and the Legion&#x27;s 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment (2ème REP), are older than the French divisions. The 1er REP was the former thrice-reconstituted 1st Foreign Parachute Battalion (1er BEP) and the 2ème REP was the former 2nd Foreign Parachute Battalion (2ème BEP). Both battalions were renamed and their Legionnaires transferred from Indochina on 1 August 1954 to Algeria by 1 November 1954. Both traced their origins to the Parachute Company of the 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment commanded by Legion Lieutenant Jacques Morin attached to the III/1er R.C.P.

With the start of the War in Algeria on 1 November 1954, the two foreign participating parachute battalions back from Indochina, the 1st Foreign Parachute Battalion (1er BEP, III Formation) and the 2nd Foreign Parachute Battalion (2ème BEP), were not part of any French parachute divisions yet and were not designated as regiments until September and 1 December 1955 respectively.

Main operations during the Algerian War included the Battle of Algiers and the Bataille of the Frontiers, fought by 60,000 soldiers including French and Legion paratroopers. For paratroopers of the Legion, the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP) and 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment (2ème REP), were the only known foreign active parachute regiments, exclusively commanded by Pierre Paul Jeanpierre for the 1er REP and the paratrooper commanders of the 2ème REP. The remainder of French paratrooper units of the French Armed Forces were commanded by Jacques Massu, Buchond, Marcel Bigeard, Paul Aussaresses. Other Legion offensives in the mountains in 1959 included operations Jumelles, Cigales, and Ariège in the Aures and the last in Kabylie.

The image of the Legion as a professional and non-political force was tarnished when the elite 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment 1er REP, which was also part of the 10th Parachute Division played a leading role in the generals&#x27; putsch of 1961 and was subsequently disbanded.

==== Generals&#x27; putsch and reduction of Foreign Legion ====


Coming out of a difficult Indochinese conflict, the Foreign Legion reinforced cohesion by extending the duration of basic training. Efforts exerted were successful during this transit; however, entering into December 1960 and the generals&#x27; putsch, a crisis hit the legion putting its faith at the corps of the Army.

For having rallied to the generals&#x27; putsch of April 1961, the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment of the 10th Parachute Division was dissolved on 30 April 1961 at Zeralda.

In 1961, at the issue of the putsch, the 1st Mounted Saharan Squadron of the Foreign Legion () received the missions to assure surveillance and policing.

The independence of Algeria from the French in 1962 was traumatising since it ended with the enforced abandonment of the barracks command center at Sidi Bel Abbès established in 1842. Upon being notified that the elite regiment was to be disbanded and that they were to be reassigned, legionnaires of the 1er REP burned the Chinese pavilion acquired following the Siege of Tuyên Quang in 1884. The relics from the Legion&#x27;s history museum, including the wooden hand of Captain Jean Danjou, subsequently accompanied the Legion to France. Also removed from Sidi Bel Abbès were the symbolic Legion remains of General Paul-Frédéric Rollet ( The Father of the Legion ), Legion officer Prince Count Aage of Rosenborg, and Legionnaire Heinz Zimmermann (last fatal casualty in Algeria).

The Legion acquired its parade song &quot;Non, je ne regrette rien&quot; (&quot;No, I regret nothing&quot;), a 1960 Édith Piaf song sung by Sous-Officiers and legionnaires as they left their barracks for re-deployment following the Algiers putsch of 1961. The song has remained a part of Legion heritage since.

The 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment 1er REP was disbanded on 30 April 1961. However, the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment 2ème REP prevailed in existence, while most of the personnel of the Saharan Companies were integrated into the 1st Foreign Infantry Regiment, 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment and 4th Foreign Infantry Regiment respectively.

===Post-colonial Africa===
By the mid-1960s the Legion had lost its traditional and spiritual home in French Algeria and elite units had been dissolved. President de Gaulle considered disbanding it altogether but, being reminded of the Marching Regiments, and that the 13th Demi-Brigade was one of the first units to declare for him in 1940 and taking also into consideration the effective service of various Saharan units and performances of other Legions units, he chose instead to downsize the Legion from 40,000 to 8,000 men and relocate it to metropolitan France. Legion units continued to be assigned to overseas service, although not in North Africa (see below).

=== 1962–present ===

In the early 1960s, and besides ongoing global rapid deployments, the Legion also stationed forces on various continents while operating different function units.

The main Disciplinary Company of the Foreign Legion (CDLE), based on rules and regulations set by général Rollet in 1931, received serious offenders sent from Legion regiments garrisoned or operating in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, the Levant and Tonkin (special section of the 5th Foreign Infantry Regiment and later in 1963, part of a Saharan disciplinary section unit of the 5e REI and 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment). It was dissolved on July 1, 1964.

From 1965 to 1967, the Legion operated several companies, including the 5th Heavy Weight Transport Company (CTGP), mainly in charge of evacuating the Sahara. The area of responsibility of some of these units extended from the confines of the in-between of the Sahara to the Mediterranean. Ongoing interventions and rapid deployments two years later and the following years included in part:

* 1969–1971 : interventions in Chad
* 1978–present : Peacekeeping operations around the Mediterranean, including the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon during the Global War on Terror
* 1978–1978 : Battle of Kolwezi (Zaïre)
* 1981–1984 : Peacekeeping operations in Lebanon at the corps of the United Nations Multinational Force during the Lebanese Civil War along with the 31ème Brigade which included the 1st Foreign Regiment 1er RE. Operation Épaulard I was spearheaded by Lieutenant-colonel Bernard Janvier. The Multinational Force also included the British Armed Forces 1st The Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards, U.S. American contingents of United States Marine Corps and the United States Navy, the French Navy and 28 exclusive French Armed Forces regiments including French paratroopers regiments, companies, units of the 11th Parachute Brigade along with the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment 2e REP. The multinational force also included the Irish Armed Forces and units of the French National Gendarmerie, Italian paratroopers from the Folgore Brigade, and infantry units from the Bersaglieri regiments and Marines of the San Marco Battalion.

====Gulf War 1990–1991====

In September 1990, the 1st Foreign Regiment, the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment, the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment, the 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment, and the 6th Foreign Engineer Regiment were sent to the Persian Gulf as a part of Opération Daguet along with the 1st Spahi Regiment, the 11th Marine Artillery Regiment, the 3rd Marine Infantry Regiment, the 21st Marine Infantry Regiment, the French Army Light Aviation, the Régiment d&#x27;infanterie-chars de marine, and components of the 35th Parachute Artillery Regiment, the 1st Parachute Hussard Regiment, and the 17th Parachute Engineer Regiment. Division Daguet was commanded by Général de brigade Bernard Janvier.

The Legion force, made up of 27 different nationalities, was attached to the French 6th Light Armoured Division whose mission was to protect the Coalition&#x27;s left flank.

After the four-week air campaign, coalition forces launched the ground offensive. They quickly penetrated deep into Iraq, with the Legion taking the As-Salman Airport, meeting little resistance. The war ended after a hundred hours of fighting on the ground, which resulted in very light casualties for the Legion. During war, French Foreign Legion engineers operated in support of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 82nd Airborne Division, and provided the EOD services to the division. After the ceasefire, they conducted a joint mine clearing operation with a Royal Australian Navy clearance divers.

==Organization==
Regarding the operational aspect, the units of the Legion belong to different brigades or territorial commands of the French Army. With regard to the administrative management (including recruitment, traditions and training), these units depend on the Foreign Legion Command (COMLE), which itself is subordinate to the Army.

The regiments are now mainly stationed in Metropolitan France, with some units in the overseas departments and territories (mainly in French Guiana).

==Composition==
The legionnaires are an integral part of the French Army. Today, they constitute some 7–8% of its strength (or 11% of the Ground Operational Forces, FOT, French Army operational units).

The Foreign Legion is the only unit of the French Army open to people of any nationality. Most legionnaires still come from European countries but a growing percentage comes from Latin America and Asia. Most of the Foreign Legion&#x27;s commissioned officers are French with approximately 10% being Legionnaires who have risen through the ranks.

Members come from 140 countries. In the past, legionnaires were forced to enlist under a pseudonym (&quot;declared identity&quot;). This policy was designed to allow recruits who wanted to restart their lives to enlist. The Legion held the belief that it was fairer to make all new recruits use declared identities. French citizens can enlist under a declared, fictitious, foreign citizenship (generally, a francophone one, often that of Belgium, Canada, or Switzerland). As of 20 September 2010, new recruits may enlist under their real identities or under declared identities. Recruits who do enlist with declared identities may, after one year&#x27;s service, regularise their situations under their true identities. After serving in the Foreign Legion for three years, a legionnaire may apply for French citizenship. He must be serving under his real name, must have no problems with the authorities, and must have served with &quot;honour and fidelity&quot;.

The Foreign Legion does not accept women in its ranks, however, there has been one official female legionnaire, Susan Travers, an Englishwoman who joined the Free French Forces during World War II. She became a member of the Foreign Legion after the war, and subsequently served in Vietnam during the First Indochina War. In October 2000, it was announced women would no longer be barred from service. However, this announcement was retracted one month later and blamed on a &quot;miscommunication&quot;; a spokesman confirmed the policy barring women from the Legion would remain unchanged.

===Membership by country===
As of 2008, legionnaires came from 140 countries. The majority of enlisted men originate from outside France, while the majority of the officer corps consists of Frenchmen. Many recruits originate from Eastern Europe and Latin America. Neil Tweedie of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said that Germany traditionally provided many recruits, &quot;somewhat ironically given the Legion&#x27;s bloody role in two world wars.&quot;

As of 2024, Belarusian and Russian citizens are no longer allowed to join the legion due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==== Alsace-Lorraine ====
Original nationalities of the Foreign Legion reflect events in history at the time they joined. Many former Wehrmacht personnel joined in the wake of World War II as many soldiers returning to civilian life found it hard to find reliable employment. Jean-Denis Lepage reports that &quot;The Foreign Legion discreetly recruited from German P.O.W. camps&quot;, but adds that the number of these recruits has been subsequently exaggerated. Bernard B. Fall, who was a supporter of the French government, writing in the context of the First Indochina War, questioned the notion that the Foreign Legion was mainly German at that time, calling it:

[a] canard...with the sub-variant that all those Germans were at least SS generals and other much wanted war criminals. As a rule, and in order to prevent any particular nation from making the Foreign Legion into a Praetorian Guard, any particular national component is kept at about 25 percent of the total. Even supposing (and this was the case, of course) that the French recruiters, in the eagerness for candidates would sign up Germans enlisting as Swiss, Austrian, Scandinavian and other nationalities of related ethnic background, it is unlikely that the number of Germans in the Foreign Legion ever exceeded 35 percent. Thus, without making an allowance for losses, rotation, discharges, etc., the maximum number of Germans fighting in Indochina at any one time reached perhaps 7,000 out of 278,000. As to the ex-Nazis, the early arrivals contained a number of them, none of whom were known to be war criminals. French intelligence saw to that.
Since, in view of the rugged Indochinese climate, older men without previous tropical experience constituted more a liability than an asset, the average age of the Foreign Legion enlistees was about 23. At the time of the battle of Dien Bien Phu, any legionnaire of that age group was at the worst, in his &quot;Hitler Youth&quot; shorts when the [Third] Reich collapsed.

The Foreign Legion accepts people enlisting under a nationality that is not their own. A proportion of the Swiss and Belgians are actually likely to be Frenchmen who wish to avoid detection. In addition many Alsatians are said to have joined the Foreign Legion when Alsace was part of the German Empire, and may have been recorded as German while considering themselves French.

Regarding recruitment conditions within the Foreign Legion, see the official page (in English) dedicated to the subject: With regard to age limits, recruits can be accepted from ages ranging from 17½ (with parental consent) to 39½ years old.

===Countries that allow post-Foreign Legion contract===

In the European Union framework, post Legion enlistment is less clear. Denmark, Norway, Germany and Portugal allow post-Legion enlistment. The European Union twin threads seem to be recognized dual nationality status or restricting constitutional article.

The United States allows post-Legion enlistment in its National Guard of career soldiers (up to the rank of captain) who are Green Card holders.

Israel allows post-Legion enlistment.

One of the biggest national groups in the Legion are Poles. Polish law allows service in a foreign army, but only after written permission from the Polish Ministry of National Defence.

==Recruitment process==

===Basic training===

While all rank and file members of the Legion are required to serve under &quot;Foreign Status&quot; (&quot;à titre étranger&quot;), even if they are French nationals, non-commissioned and commissioned officers can serve under either French or Foreign Status. Foreign Status NCOs and officers are exclusively promoted from the ranks and represent 10% of the officers corps of the Legion. French Status officers are either members of other units of the French Army attached to the Legion or promoted Legionnaires who have chosen to become French nationals.

Basic training for the Foreign Legion is conducted in the 4th Foreign Regiment. This is an operational combat regiment which provides a training course of 15–17 weeks, before recruits are assigned to their operational units:

* Initial training of 4–6 weeks at &quot;The Farm&quot; (&quot;La Ferme&quot;) – introduction to military lifestyle; outdoor and field activities.
* &quot;Képi Blanc&quot; March (&quot;Marche Képi Blanc&quot;) – a 50-kilometer two-day march (25 km per day) in full kit, followed by the &quot;Képi Blanc&quot; ceremony on the 3rd day.
* Technical and practical training (alternating with barracks and field training) – three weeks.
* Mountain training (at Formiguères in the French Pyrenees) – one week.
* Technical and practical training (alternating barracks and field training) – three weeks.
* Examinations and obtention of the elementary technical certificate (CTE) – one week.
* Raid March (&quot;Marche Raid&quot;) – a 120-kilometer final march, which must be completed in three days.
* Light vehicle drivers education (drivers license) – one week.
* Return to Aubagne before reporting to the assigned operational regiment – one week.

Education in the French language (reading, writing and pronunciation) is taught on a daily basis throughout all of basic training.


==Traditions==
As the Foreign Legion is composed of soldiers of different nationalities and backgrounds, it is necessary to develop an intense &quot;&quot;, which is achieved through the development of , specific traditions, the loyalty of its legionnaires, the quality of their training, and the pride of being a soldier in an elite unit.

===Code of honour===
The &quot;Legionnaire&#x27;s Code of Honour&quot; is the Legion&#x27;s , recited in French only. The Code of Honour was adopted in the 1980s.


=== Mottos ===

====&quot;Honneur et Fidélité&quot;====
In contrast to all other French Army units, the motto embroidered on the Foreign Legion&#x27;s regimental flags is not &quot;Honneur et Patrie&quot; (Honour and Fatherland) but &quot;Honneur et Fidélité&quot; (Honour and Fidelity).

====&quot;Legio Patria Nostra&quot;====
&quot;Legio Patria Nostra&quot; (in French &quot;La Légion est notre Patrie&quot;, in English &quot;The Legion is our Fatherland&quot;) is the Latin motto of the Foreign Legion. The adoption of the Foreign Legion as a new &quot;Fatherland&quot; does not imply the repudiation by the legionnaire of his original nationality. The Foreign Legion is required to obtain the agreement of any legionnaire before he is placed in any situation where he might have to serve against his country of birth.

====Regimental mottos====
*1er R.E: &quot;Honneur et Fidélité&quot;
* G.R.L.E: &quot;Honneur et Fidélité&quot;
*1er REC: &quot;Honneur et Fidélité&quot; and &quot;Nec Pluribus Impar&quot; (&quot;No other equal&quot;)

===Insignia===
The Legion&#x27;s emblem consists of a flaming heraldic grenade in the shape of a French &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot;.

==Ranks==
All volunteers in the Foreign Legion begin their careers as basic legionnaires with one in four eventually becoming a &quot;sous-officier&quot; (non-commissioned officer). On joining, a new recruit receives a monthly salary of €1,572 in addition to food and lodgings. He is also given his own new rifle, which according to the lore of the &quot;Legion&quot; must never be left on a battlefield. Promotion is concurrent with the ranks in the French Army.

===Non-commissioned and warrant officers===


A &quot;dress uniform&quot;&#x27;s insignia is composed of three components; rank emblem, regimental patch, and seniority chevrons. In the one pictured, the three upward pointing gold chevrons indicate a &quot;Sergent-chef&quot;. The diamond-shaped regimental patch (&quot;Écusson&quot;) is formed of three green diamond shapes surrounding a grenade emblem, with the three diamonds indicating a Colonial unit, in comparison to one diamond for a unit of Regulars, or two diamonds for a Reserves unit. The Légion grenade emblem has seven flames rather than the usual five, and the two downward pointing seniority chevrons indicate at least 10 years of service. Some &quot;Caporal&quot;s-&quot;Chef&quot; may have as many as six seniority chevrons for 30 or more years of service. This style of insignia is worn only on the left sleeve of the dress uniform, while a similar-sized insignia without the regimental diamond and seniority chevrons is worn on the right sleeve. An exception exists for the right sleeve insignia for the Pioneer units, which incorporates a gold or green Pioneer emblem, depending on rank, but not the seniority chevrons, which are worn on the left sleeve insignia below the regimental diamond as previously described.

&quot;Sous-officiers&quot; (NCOs) including warrant officers account for 25% of the current Foreign Legion&#x27;s total manpower.
===Commissioned officers===

Most officers are regulars of the French Army though roughly 10% are former non-commissioned officers promoted from the ranks.
===Seniority chevrons===
The Foreign Legion uses gold coloured chevrons (&quot;chevrons d&#x27;ancienneté&quot;) pointed downward to indicate seniority. Worn by ordinary legionnaires and non-commissioned officers beneath the rank insignia and regimental emblem only on the left sleeve of the dress uniform, each chevron denotes five years of service in the Legion. Seniority chevrons are not worn by commissioned officers.

===Honorary ranks===
Honorary ranks have been awarded by the French Army to individuals credited with exceptional acts of courage since 1796. In the Foreign Legion, General Paul-Frédéric Rollet introduced the practice of awarding honorary Legion ranks to distinguished individuals, both civilian and military, in the early 20th century.

Recipients of these honorary appointments had participated with units of the Legion on active service in an exemplary manner, or had rendered exceptional service to the Legion in non-combat situations. More than 1,200 individuals have been granted honorary ranks in the Legion &quot;pour services éminent&quot;. The majority of these awards have been made to military personnel in wartime, earning titles such as &quot;Legionnaire d&#x27;Honneur&quot; or &quot;Sergent-Chef de Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;, while other recipients have included nurses, journalists, painters, and ministers who have rendered meritorious service to the Foreign Legion.

==Pioneers==
The &quot;Pionniers&quot; (pioneers) are the combat engineers and a traditional unit of the Foreign Legion. The sapper traditionally sport large beards, wear leather aprons and gloves and hold axes. The sappers were very common in European armies during the Napoleonic Era but progressively disappeared during the 19th century. The French Army, including the Legion disbanded its regimental sapper platoons in 1870. However, in 1931 one of a number of traditions restored to mark the hundredth anniversary of the Legion&#x27;s founding was the reestablishment of its bearded &quot;Pionniers&quot;.

In the French Army, since the 18th century, every infantry regiment included a small detachment of pioneers. In addition to undertaking road building and entrenchment work, such units were tasked with using their axes and shovels to clear obstacles under enemy fire opening the way for the rest of the infantry. The danger of such missions was recognised by allowing certain privileges, such as being authorised to wear beards.

The current pioneer platoon of the Foreign Legion is provided by the Legion depot and headquarters regiment for public ceremonies. The unit has reintroduced the symbols of the Napoleonic sappers: the beard, the axe, the leather apron, the crossed-axes insignia and the leather gloves. When parades of the Foreign Legion are opened by this unit, it is to commemorate the traditional role of the sappers &quot;opening the way&quot; for the troops.

==Marching cadences and songs==

Also notable is the marching pace of the Foreign Legion. In comparison to the 116-step-per-minute pace of other French units, the Foreign Legion has an 88-step-per-minute marching speed. It is also referred to by Legionnaires as the &quot;crawl&quot;. This can be seen at ceremonial parades and public displays attended by the Foreign Legion, particularly while parading in Paris on 14 July (Bastille Day Military Parade). Because of the impressively slow pace, the Foreign Legion is always the last unit marching in any parade. The Foreign Legion is normally accompanied by its own band, which traditionally plays the march of any one of the Foreign Legion&#x27;s regiments, except that of the unit actually on parade. The regimental song of each unit and &quot;Le Boudin&quot; is sung by legionnaires standing at attention. Also, because the Foreign Legion must always stay together, it does not break formation into two when approaching the presidential grandstand, as other French military units do, in order to preserve the unity of the Legion.

Contrary to popular belief, the adoption of the Foreign Legion&#x27;s slow marching speed was not due to a need to preserve energy and fluids during long marches under the hot Algerian sun. Its exact origins are unclear, but the official explanation is that although the pace regulation does not seem to have been instituted before 1945, it hails back to the slow marching pace of the Ancien Régime, and its reintroduction was a &quot;return to traditional roots&quot;. This was in fact, the march step of the Foreign Legion&#x27;s ancestor units – the &quot;Régiments Étrangers&quot; or Foreign Regiments of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; French Army, the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;″s foreign units, and the pre-1831 foreign regiments.

==Uniform==

From its foundation until World War I the Foreign Legion normally wore the uniform of the French line infantry for parade with a few special distinctions. Essentially this consisted of a dark blue coat (later tunic) worn with red trousers. The field uniform was often modified under the influence of the extremes of climate and terrain in which the Foreign Legion served. Shakos were soon replaced by the light cloth kepi, which was far more suitable for North African conditions. The practice of wearing heavy &quot;capotes&quot; (greatcoats) on the march and &quot;vestes&quot; (short hip-length jackets) as working dress in barracks was followed by the Foreign Legion from its establishment.
One short lived aberration was the wearing of green uniforms in 1856 by Foreign Legion units recruited in Switzerland for service in the Crimean War. In the Crimea itself (1854–59) a hooded coat and red or blue waist sashes were adopted for winter dress, while during the Mexican Intervention (1863–65) straw hats or sombreros were sometimes substituted for the kepi. When the latter was worn it was usually covered with a white &quot;havelock&quot; (linen cover) – the predecessor of the white kepi that was to become a symbol of the Foreign Legion. Foreign Legion units serving in France during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 were distinguishable only by minor details of insignia from the bulk of the French infantry. However subsequent colonial campaigns saw an increasing use of special garments for hot weather wear such as collarless &quot;keo&quot; blouses in Tonkin 1884–85, khaki drill jackets in Dahomey (1892) and drab covered topees worn with all-white fatigue dress in Madagascar (1895).
In the early 20th century the legionnaire wore a red kepi with blue band and piping, dark blue tunic with red collar, red cuff patches, and red trousers. Distinctive features were the green epaulettes (replacing the red of the line) worn with red woollen fringes; plus the embroidered Legion badge of a red flaming grenade, worn on the kepi front instead of a regimental number. In the field a light khaki cover was worn over the kepi, sometimes with a protective neck curtain attached. The standard medium-blue double breasted greatcoat (&quot;capote&quot;) of the French infantry was worn, usually buttoned back to free the legs for marching. From the 1830s the legionnaires had worn a broad blue woollen sash around the waist, like other European units of the French Army of Africa (such as the Zouaves or the Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique), while indigenous units of the Army of Africa (spahis and tirailleurs) wore red sashes. White linen trousers tucked into short leather leggings were substituted for red serge in hot weather. This was the origin of the &quot;Beau Geste&quot; image.

In barracks a white bleached kepi cover was often worn together with a short dark blue jacket (&quot;veste&quot;) or white blouse plus white trousers. The original kepi cover was khaki and due to constant washing turned white quickly. The white or khaki kepi cover was not unique to the Foreign Legion at this stage but was commonly seen amongst other French units in North Africa. It later became particularly identified with the Foreign Legion as the unit most likely to serve at remote frontier posts (other than locally recruited tirailleurs who wore fezzes or turbans). The variances of climate in North Africa led the French Army to the sensible expedient of letting local commanders decide on the appropriate &quot;tenue de jour&quot; (uniform of the day) according to circumstances. Thus a legionnaire might parade or walk out in blue tunic and white trousers in hot weather, blue tunic and red trousers in normal temperatures or wear the blue greatcoat with red trousers under colder conditions. The sash could be worn with greatcoat, blouse or veste but not with the tunic. Epaulettes were a detachable dress item worn only with tunic or greatcoat for parade or off duty wear.
Officers wore the same dark blue (almost black) tunics as those of their colleagues in the French line regiments, except that black replaced red as a facing colour on collar and cuffs. Gold fringed epaulettes were worn for full dress and rank was shown by the number of gold rings on both kepi and cuffs. Trousers were red with black stripes or white according to occasion or conditions. All-white or light khaki uniforms (from as early as the 1890s) were often worn in the field or for ordinary duties in barracks. Non-commissioned officers were distinguished by red or gold diagonal stripes on the lower sleeves of tunics, vestes and greatcoats. Small detachable stripes were buttoned on to the front of the white shirt-like blouse.

Prior to 1914 units in Indo-China wore white or khaki Colonial Infantry uniforms with Foreign Legion insignia, to overcome supply difficulties. This dress included a white sun helmet of a model that was also issued to Foreign Legion units serving in the outposts of Southern Algeria, though never popular with its wearers. During the initial months of World War I, Foreign Legion units serving in France wore the standard blue greatcoat and red trousers of the French line infantry, distinguished only by collar patches of the same blue as the capote, instead of red. After a short period in sky-blue the Foreign Legion adopted khaki, in common with other units of the &quot;Armée d&#x27;Afrique&quot;, with steel helmets, from early 1916. A mustard shade of khaki drill had been worn on active service in Morocco from 1909, replacing the classic blue and white. The latter continued to be worn in the relatively peaceful conditions of Algeria throughout World War I, although increasingly replaced by khaki drill. The pre-1914 blue and red uniforms could still be occasionally seen as garrison dress in Algeria until stocks were used up about 1919.

During the early 1920s plain khaki drill uniforms of a standard pattern became universal issue for the Foreign Legion with only the red and blue kepi (with or without a cover) and green collar braiding to distinguish the Legionnaire from other French soldiers serving in North African and Indo-China. The neck curtain ceased to be worn from about 1915, although it survived in the newly raised Foreign Legion Cavalry Regiment into the 1920s. The white blouse (&quot;bourgeron&quot;) and trousers dating from 1882 were retained for fatigue wear until the 1930s.

At the time of the Foreign Legion&#x27;s centennial in 1931, a number of traditional features were reintroduced at the initiative of the then commander Colonel Rollet. These included the blue sash and green/red epaulettes. In 1939 the white covered kepi won recognition as the official headdress of the Foreign Legion to be worn on most occasions, rather than simply as a means of reflecting heat and protecting the blue and red material underneath. The Third Foreign Infantry Regiment adopted white tunics and trousers for walking-out dress during the 1930s
and all Foreign Legion officers were required to obtain full dress uniforms in the pre-war colours of black and red from 1932 to 1939.

During World War II the Foreign Legion wore a wide range of uniform styles depending on supply sources. These ranged from the heavy capotes and Adrian helmets of 1940 through to British battledress and American field uniforms from 1943 to 1945. The white kepi was stubbornly retained whenever possible.
From 1940 until 1963 the Foreign Legion maintained four Saharan Companies (&quot;Compagnies Sahariennes&quot;) as part of the French forces used to patrol and police the desert regions to the south of Morocco and Algeria. Special uniforms were developed for these units, modeled on those of the French officered Camel Corps (&quot;Méharistes&quot;) having prime responsibility for the Sahara. In full dress these included black or white zouave style trousers, worn with white tunics and long flowing cloaks. The Legion companies maintained their separate identity by retaining their distinctive kepis, sashes and fringed epaulettes.

The white kepis, together with the sash and epaulettes survive in the Foreign Legion&#x27;s modern parade dress. Since the 1990s the modern kepi has been made wholly of white material rather than simply worn with a white cover. Officers and senior noncommissioned officers still wear their kepis in the pre-1939 colours of dark blue and red. A green tie and (for officers) a green waistcoat recall the traditional branch colour of the Foreign Legion. From 1959 a green beret (previously worn only by the legion&#x27;s paratroopers) became the universal ordinary duty headdress, with the kepi reserved for parade and off duty wear. Other items of currently worn dress are the standard issue of the French Army.

==Equipment==

The Legion is basically equipped with the same equipment as similar units elsewhere in the French Army. These include:
* The FAMAS assault rifle, a French-made automatic bullpup-style rifle, chambered in the 5.56×45mm NATO round. The FAMAS is being replaced by the Heckler &amp; Koch HK416. The 13e DBLE, was the first French Army regiment to use the new rifle.
* The SPECTRA is a ballistic helmet, designed by the French military, fitted with real-time positioning and information system, and with light amplifiers for night vision.
* The FÉLIN suit, an infantry combat system that combines ample pouches, reinforced body protections and a portable electronic platform.

==Legacy==
Beyond its reputation as an elite unit often engaged in serious fighting, the recruitment practices of the Foreign Legion have also led to a somewhat romanticised view of it being a place for disgraced or &quot;wronged&quot; men looking to leave behind their old lives and start new ones. This view of the legion is common in literature, and has been used for dramatic effect in many films, not the least of which are the several versions of &quot;Beau Geste&quot;. Three songs by Edith Piaf, most notably &quot;Non, je ne regrette rien&quot; (No, I regret nothing), became associated with the legion, during the 1960s when members of the Legion were accused of being implicated in a failed coup d&#x27;état during the Algerian War. Today it is still a popular Legion &quot;chant&quot; sung when on parade, adapting it to their unique marching cadence of 88 steps to the minute. Various fictional portrayals and references to the legion have been made over the years, such as in film, television, music, video games and art. The comic strip &quot;Crock&quot;, which depicted life in the legion, ran from 1975 to 2012.

===Emulation by other countries===
====Chinese Ever Victorious Army====
The Ever Victorious Army was the name given to a Chinese imperial army in the late 19th century. Commanded by Frederick Townsend Ward, the new force originally comprised about 200 mostly European mercenaries, recruited in the Shanghai area from sailors, deserters and adventurers. Many were dismissed in the summer of 1861, but the remainder became the officers of the Chinese soldiers recruited mainly in and around Sungkiang (Songjiang). The Chinese troops were increased to 3,000 by May 1862, all equipped with Western firearms and equipment by the British authorities in Shanghai. Throughout its four-year existence the Ever Victorious Army was mainly to operate within a thirty-mile radius of Shanghai. It was disbanded in May 1864 with 104 foreign officers and 2,288 Chinese soldiers being paid off. The bulk of the artillery and some infantry transferred to the Chinese Imperial forces. It was the first Chinese army trained in European techniques, tactics, and strategy.

====Israeli Mahal====
In Israel, Mahal (, an acronym for &quot;Mitnadvei Ḥutz LaAretz&quot;, which means &quot;Volunteers from outside the Land [of Israel]&quot;) is a term designating non-Israelis serving in the Israeli military. The term originates with the approximately 4,000 both Jewish and non-Jewish volunteers who went to Israel to fight in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War including Aliyah Bet. The original Mahalniks were mostly World War II veterans who had previously served in the American and British armed forces.

Today, there is a program, Garin Tzabar, within the Israeli Ministry of Defense that administers the enlistment of non-Israeli citizens in the country&#x27;s armed forces. Programs enable foreigners to join the Israel Defense Forces if they are of Jewish descent (which is defined as at least one grandparent).

====Netherlands KNIL Army====
Though not named &quot;Foreign Legion&quot;, the Dutch Koninklijk Nederlandsch-Indische Leger (KNIL), or Royal Dutch (East) Indies Army (in reference to the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia), was created in 1830, a year before the French Foreign Legion, and is therefore not an emulation but an entirely original idea and had a similar recruitment policy. It stopped being an army of foreigners around 1900 when recruitment was restricted to Dutch citizens and to the indigenous peoples of the Dutch East Indies. The KNIL was finally disbanded on 26 July 1950, seven months after the Netherlands formally recognised Indonesia as a sovereign state, and almost five years after Indonesia declared its independence.

====Rhodesian Light Infantry and 7 Independent Company====

During the Rhodesian Bush War of the 1960s and 1970s, the Rhodesian Security Forces enlisted volunteers from overseas on the same pay and conditions of service as locally based regulars. The vast majority of the Rhodesian Army&#x27;s foreigners joined the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI), a heliborne commando regiment with a glamorous international reputation; this unit became colloquially known as the &quot;Rhodesian foreign legion&quot; as a result, even though foreigners never made up more than about a third of its men. According to Chris Cocks, an RLI veteran, &quot;the RLI was a mirror of the French Foreign Legion, in that recruiters paid little heed as to a man&#x27;s past and asked no questions. ... And like the Foreign Legion, once in the ranks, a man&#x27;s past was irrelevant.&quot; Just as French Foreign Legionnaires must speak French, the Rhodesian Army required its foreigners to be English-speakers. Many of them were professional soldiers, attracted by the regiment&#x27;s reputation—mostly former British soldiers, or Vietnam veterans from the United States, Australian and New Zealand forces—and these became a key part of the unit. Others, with no military experience, were often motivated to join the Rhodesian Army by their opposition to communism, or a desire for adventure or to escape the past.

After the Rhodesians&#x27; overseas recruiting campaign for English-speakers, started in 1974, proved successful, they began recruiting French-speakers as well, in 1977. These francophone recruits were placed in their own unit, 7 Independent Company, Rhodesia Regiment, which was commanded by French-speaking officers and operated entirely in French. The experiment was not generally considered a success by the Rhodesian commanders, however, and the company was disbanded in early 1978.

====Russian &quot;Foreign Legion&quot;====
In 2010 the service conditions of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation changed to allow foreigners. The actual term Russian &quot;Foreign Legion&quot; is a colloquial expression without any official recognition. Under the plan, foreigners without dual citizenship are able to sign up for five-year contracts and will be eligible for Russian citizenship after serving three years. Experts say the change opens the way for Commonwealth of Independent States citizens to get fast-track Russian citizenship, and counter the effects of Russia&#x27;s demographic crisis on its army recruitment.

====Donetsk &amp; Luhansk Peoples Republic &quot;Novo-Russia Foreign Legion&quot;====

During the war in Donbas, the separatist Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic recruited foreigners who were ideologically aligned to Russia to come fight for them. This resulted in the formation of the Novo-Russia Foreign Legion, with hundreds of foreigners having reportedly joined its ranks. Ukraine reported that in 2015 around 30,000 foreign fighters were fighting for the separatists with the main nationalities being Russian and Serbian, with westerners making up a minority of fighters.

====Spanish &quot;Foreign Legion&quot;====
The Spanish &quot;Tercio de Extranjeros&quot; was created in 1920, in direct emulation of the French Foreign Legion. It subsequently had a significant role in Spain&#x27;s colonial wars in Morocco and in the Spanish Civil War on the Nationalist side. The Spanish Foreign Legion recruited foreigners until 1986 but unlike its French model, the number of non-Spanish recruits never exceeded 25%, most of these from Latin America. It is now called the &quot;Spanish Legion&quot; and has been involved in several modern conflicts and operations, including Afghanistan and the UN Mission in Lebanon UNIFIL .

====Ukrainian International Legion &amp; Georgian Legion====

The Georgian Legion was formed fighting on the side of Ukraine in the war in Donbas and the Russo-Ukrainian War. The unit was organized in 2014, and in 2016 it was transferred under the control of the Ukrainian Army, under the 25th Mechanized Infantry Battalion &quot;Kyiv Rus&quot;. Although formed by mostly ethnic Georgian volunteers, and commanded by veteran Georgian officer Mamuka Mamulashvili, the legion was noted as being particularly good at recruiting Americans; before the formation of the International Legion of Ukraine in 2022, most foreign fighters served the Georgian Legion.

In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the government of Ukraine quickly established a component of its Territorial Defense Forces consisting of volunteers from foreign countries. Within the International Legion, some single nationality battalions were established to avoid language barriers in order to facilitate their rapid response to the invasion.

<text>Feedback occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause and effect that forms a circuit or loop. The system can then be said to &quot;feed back&quot; into itself. The notion of cause-and-effect has to be handled carefully when applied to feedback systems:

==History==
Self-regulating mechanisms have existed since antiquity, and the idea of feedback started to enter economic theory in Britain by the 18th century, but it was not at that time recognized as a universal abstraction and so did not have a name.

The first ever known artificial feedback device was a float valve, for maintaining water at a constant level, invented in 270 BC in Alexandria, Egypt. This device illustrated the principle of feedback: a low water level opens the valve, the rising water then provides feedback into the system, closing the valve when the required level is reached. This then reoccurs in a circular fashion as the water level fluctuates.

Centrifugal governors were used to regulate the distance and pressure between millstones in windmills since the 17th century. In 1788, James Watt designed his first centrifugal governor following a suggestion from his business partner Matthew Boulton, for use in the steam engines of their production. Early steam engines employed a purely reciprocating motion, and were used for pumping water – an application that could tolerate variations in the working speed, but the use of steam engines for other applications called for more precise control of the speed.

In 1868, James Clerk Maxwell wrote a famous paper, &quot;On governors&quot;, that is widely considered a classic in feedback control theory. This was a landmark paper on control theory and the mathematics of feedback.

The verb phrase &quot;to feed back&quot;, in the sense of returning to an earlier position in a mechanical process, was in use in the US by the 1860s, and in 1909, Nobel laureate Karl Ferdinand Braun used the term &quot;feed-back&quot; as a noun to refer to (undesired) coupling between components of an electronic circuit.

By the end of 1912, researchers using early electronic amplifiers (audions) had discovered that deliberately coupling part of the output signal back to the input circuit would boost the amplification (through regeneration), but would also cause the audion to howl or sing. This action of feeding back of the signal from output to input gave rise to the use of the term &quot;feedback&quot; as a distinct word by 1920.

The development of cybernetics from the 1940s onwards was centred around the study of circular causal feedback mechanisms.

Over the years there has been some dispute as to the best definition of feedback. According to cybernetician Ashby (1956), mathematicians and theorists interested in the principles of feedback mechanisms prefer the definition of &quot;circularity of action&quot;, which keeps the theory simple and consistent. For those with more practical aims, feedback should be a deliberate effect via some more tangible connection.
Focusing on uses in management theory, Ramaprasad (1983) defines feedback generally as &quot;...information about the gap between the actual level and the reference level of a system parameter&quot; that is used to &quot;alter the gap in some way&quot;. He emphasizes that the information by itself is not feedback unless translated into action.

==Types==

===Positive and negative feedback===


Positive feedback: If the signal feedback from output is in phase with the input signal, the feedback is called positive feedback.

Negative feedback: If the signal feedback is out of phase by 180° with respect to the input signal, the feedback is called negative feedback.

As an example of negative feedback, the diagram might represent a cruise control system in a car that matches a target speed such as the speed limit. The controlled system is the car; its input includes the combined torque from the engine and from the changing slope of the road (the disturbance). The car&#x27;s speed (status) is measured by a speedometer. The error signal is the difference of the speed as measured by the speedometer from the target speed (set point). The controller interprets the speed to adjust the accelerator, commanding the fuel flow to the engine (the effector). The resulting change in engine torque, the feedback, combines with the torque exerted by the change of road grade to reduce the error in speed, minimising the changing slope.

The terms &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; were first applied to feedback prior to WWII. The idea of positive feedback already existed in the 1920s when the regenerative circuit was made. Friis and Jensen (1924) described this circuit in a set of electronic amplifiers as a case where &quot;the &quot;feed-back&quot; action is positive&quot; in contrast to negative feed-back action, which they mentioned only in passing. Harold Stephen Black&#x27;s classic 1934 paper first details the use of negative feedback in electronic amplifiers. According to Black:
According to Mindell (2002) confusion in the terms arose shortly after this:
Even before these terms were being used, James Clerk Maxwell had described their concept through several kinds of &quot;component motions&quot; associated with the centrifugal governors used in steam engines. He distinguished those that lead to a continued &quot;increase&quot; in a disturbance or the amplitude of a wave or oscillation, from those that lead to a &quot;decrease&quot; of the same quality.

====Terminology====
The terms positive and negative feedback are defined in different ways within different disciplines.

# the change of the &quot;gap&quot; between reference and actual values of a parameter or trait, based on whether the gap is &quot;widening&quot; (positive) or &quot;narrowing&quot; (negative).
# the valence of the &quot;action&quot; or &quot;effect&quot; that alters the gap, based on whether it makes the recipient or observer &quot;happy&quot; (positive) or &quot;unhappy&quot; (negative).

The two definitions may be confusing, like when an incentive (reward) is used to boost poor performance (narrow a gap). Referring to definition 1, some authors use alternative terms, replacing &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; with &quot;self-reinforcing&quot; and &quot;self-correcting&quot;, &quot;reinforcing&quot; and &quot;balancing&quot;, &quot;discrepancy-enhancing&quot; and &quot;discrepancy-reducing&quot; or &quot;regenerative&quot; and &quot;degenerative&quot; respectively. And for definition 2, some authors promote describing the action or effect as &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; &quot;reinforcement&quot; or &quot;punishment&quot; rather than feedback.
Yet even within a single discipline an example of feedback can be called either positive or negative, depending on how values are measured or referenced.

This confusion may arise because feedback can be used to provide &quot;information&quot; or &quot;motivate&quot;, and often has both a &quot;qualitative&quot; and a &quot;quantitative&quot; component. As Connellan and Zemke (1993) put it:
====Limitations of negative and positive feedback====
While simple systems can sometimes be described as one or the other type, many systems with feedback loops cannot be shoehorned into either type, and this is especially true when multiple loops are present.

===Other types of feedback===
In general, feedback systems can have many signals fed back and the feedback loop frequently contain mixtures of positive and negative feedback where positive and negative feedback can dominate at different frequencies or different points in the state space of a system.

The term bipolar feedback has been coined to refer to biological systems where positive and negative feedback systems can interact, the output of one affecting the input of another, and vice versa.

Some systems with feedback can have very complex behaviors such as chaotic behaviors in non-linear systems, while others have much more predictable behaviors, such as those that are used to make and design digital systems.

Feedback is used extensively in digital systems. For example, binary counters and similar devices employ feedback where the current state and inputs are used to calculate a new state which is then fed back and clocked back into the device to update it.

==Applications==
===Mathematics and dynamical systems===
By using feedback properties, the behavior of a system can be altered to meet the needs of an application; systems can be made stable, responsive or held constant. It is shown that dynamical systems with a feedback experience an adaptation to the edge of chaos.

=== Physics ===
Physical systems present feedback through the mutual interactions of its parts. Feedback is also relevant for the regulation of experimental conditions, noise reduction, and signal control. The thermodynamics of feedback-controlled systems has intrigued physicist since the Maxwell&#x27;s demon, with recent advances on the consequences for entropy reduction and performance increase.

===Biology===

In biological systems such as organisms, ecosystems, or the biosphere, most parameters must stay under control within a narrow range around a certain optimal level under certain environmental conditions. The deviation of the optimal value of the controlled parameter can result from the changes in internal and external environments. A change of some of the environmental conditions may also require change of that range to change for the system to function. The value of the parameter to maintain is recorded by a reception system and conveyed to a regulation module via an information channel. An example of this is insulin oscillations.

Biological systems contain many types of regulatory circuits, both positive and negative. As in other contexts, &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; do not imply that the feedback causes &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; effects. A negative feedback loop is one that tends to slow down a process, whereas the positive feedback loop tends to accelerate it. The mirror neurons are part of a social feedback system, when an observed action is &quot;mirrored&quot; by the brain—like a self-performed action.

Normal tissue integrity is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted molecules that act as mediators; failure of key feedback mechanisms in cancer disrupts tissue function.
In an injured or infected tissue, inflammatory mediators elicit feedback responses in cells, which alter gene expression, and change the groups of molecules expressed and secreted, including molecules that induce diverse cells to cooperate and restore tissue structure and function. This type of feedback is important because it enables coordination of immune responses and recovery from infections and injuries. During cancer, key elements of this feedback fail. This disrupts tissue function and immunity.

Mechanisms of feedback were first elucidated in bacteria, where a nutrient elicits changes in some of their metabolic functions.
Feedback is also central to the operations of genes and gene regulatory networks. Repressor (see Lac repressor) and activator proteins are used to create genetic operons, which were identified by François Jacob and Jacques Monod in 1961 as &quot;feedback loops&quot;. These feedback loops may be positive (as in the case of the coupling between a sugar molecule and the proteins that import sugar into a bacterial cell), or negative (as is often the case in metabolic consumption).

On a larger scale, feedback can have a stabilizing effect on animal populations even when profoundly affected by external changes, although time lags in feedback response can give rise to predator-prey cycles.

In zymology, feedback serves as regulation of activity of an enzyme by its direct or downstream in the metabolic pathway (see Allosteric regulation).

The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis is largely controlled by positive and negative feedback, much of which is still unknown.

In psychology, the body receives a stimulus from the environment or internally that causes the release of hormones. Release of hormones then may cause more of those hormones to be released, causing a positive feedback loop. This cycle is also found in certain behaviour. For example, &quot;shame loops&quot; occur in people who blush easily. When they realize that they are blushing, they become even more embarrassed, which leads to further blushing, and so on.

===Climate science===
The climate system is characterized by strong positive and negative feedback loops between processes that affect the state of the atmosphere, ocean, and land. A simple example is the ice–albedo positive feedback loop whereby melting snow exposes more dark ground (of lower albedo), which in turn absorbs heat and causes more snow to melt.

===Control theory===

Feedback is extensively used in control theory, using a variety of methods including state space (controls), full state feedback, and so forth. In the context of control theory, &quot;feedback&quot; is traditionally assumed to specify &quot;negative feedback&quot;.

The most common general-purpose controller using a control-loop feedback mechanism is a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Heuristically, the terms of a PID controller can be interpreted as corresponding to time: the proportional term depends on the &quot;present&quot; error, the integral term on the accumulation of &quot;past&quot; errors, and the derivative term is a prediction of &quot;future&quot; error, based on current rate of change.

===Education===
For feedback in the educational context, see corrective feedback.

===Mechanical engineering===
In ancient times, the float valve was used to regulate the flow of water in Greek and Roman water clocks; similar float valves are used to regulate fuel in a carburettor and also used to regulate tank water level in the flush toilet.

The Dutch inventor Cornelius Drebbel (1572–1633) built thermostats (c1620) to control the temperature of chicken incubators and chemical furnaces. In 1745, the windmill was improved by blacksmith Edmund Lee, who added a fantail to keep the face of the windmill pointing into the wind. In 1787, Tom Mead regulated the rotation speed of a windmill by using a centrifugal pendulum to adjust the distance between the bedstone and the runner stone (i.e., to adjust the load).

The use of the centrifugal governor by James Watt in 1788 to regulate the speed of his steam engine was one factor leading to the Industrial Revolution. Steam engines also use float valves and pressure release valves as mechanical regulation devices. A mathematical analysis of Watt&#x27;s governor was done by James Clerk Maxwell in 1868.

The &quot;Great Eastern&quot; was one of the largest steamships of its time and employed a steam powered rudder with feedback mechanism designed in 1866 by John McFarlane Gray. Joseph Farcot coined the word &quot;servo&quot; in 1873 to describe steam-powered steering systems. Hydraulic servos were later used to position guns. Elmer Ambrose Sperry of the Sperry Corporation designed the first autopilot in 1912. Nicolas Minorsky published a theoretical analysis of automatic ship steering in 1922 and described the PID controller.

Internal combustion engines of the late 20th century employed mechanical feedback mechanisms such as the vacuum timing advance but mechanical feedback was replaced by electronic engine management systems once small, robust and powerful single-chip microcontrollers became affordable.

===Electronic engineering===
The use of feedback is widespread in the design of electronic components such as amplifiers, oscillators, and stateful logic circuit elements such as flip-flops and counters. Electronic feedback systems are also very commonly used to control mechanical, thermal and other physical processes.

If the signal is inverted on its way round the control loop, the system is said to have &quot;negative feedback&quot;; otherwise, the feedback is said to be &quot;positive&quot;. Negative feedback is often deliberately introduced to increase the stability and accuracy of a system by correcting or reducing the influence of unwanted changes. This scheme can fail if the input changes faster than the system can respond to it. When this happens, the lag in arrival of the correcting signal can result in over-correction, causing the output to oscillate or &quot;hunt&quot;. While often an unwanted consequence of system behaviour, this effect is used deliberately in electronic oscillators.

Harry Nyquist at Bell Labs derived the Nyquist stability criterion for determining the stability of feedback systems. An easier method, but less general, is to use Bode plots developed by Hendrik Bode to determine the gain margin and phase margin. Design to ensure stability often involves frequency compensation to control the location of the poles of the amplifier.

Electronic feedback loops are used to control the output of electronic devices, such as amplifiers. A feedback loop is created when all or some portion of the output is fed back to the input. A device is said to be operating &quot;open loop&quot; if no output feedback is being employed and &quot;closed loop&quot; if feedback is being used.

When two or more amplifiers are cross-coupled using positive feedback, complex behaviors can be created. These &quot;multivibrators&quot; are widely used and include:
* astable circuits, which act as oscillators
* monostable circuits, which can be pushed into a state, and will return to the stable state after some time
* bistable circuits, which have two stable states that the circuit can be switched between

====Negative feedback====
Negative feedback occurs when the fed-back output signal has a relative phase of 180° with respect to the input signal (upside down). This situation is sometimes referred to as being &quot;out of phase&quot;, but that term also is used to indicate other phase separations, as in &quot;90° out of phase&quot;. Negative feedback can be used to correct output errors or to desensitize a system to unwanted fluctuations. In feedback amplifiers, this correction is generally for waveform distortion reduction or to establish a specified gain level. A general expression for the gain of a negative feedback amplifier is the asymptotic gain model.

====Positive feedback====
Positive feedback occurs when the fed-back signal is in phase with the input signal. Under certain gain conditions, positive feedback reinforces the input signal to the point where the output of the device oscillates between its maximum and minimum possible states. Positive feedback may also introduce hysteresis into a circuit. This can cause the circuit to ignore small signals and respond only to large ones. It is sometimes used to eliminate noise from a digital signal. Under some circumstances, positive feedback may cause a device to latch, i.e., to reach a condition in which the output is locked to its maximum or minimum state. This fact is very widely used in digital electronics to make bistable circuits for volatile storage of information.

The loud squeals that sometimes occurs in audio systems, PA systems, and rock music are known as audio feedback. If a microphone is in front of a loudspeaker that it is connected to, sound that the microphone picks up comes out of the speaker, and is picked up by the microphone and re-amplified. If the loop gain is sufficient, howling or squealing at the maximum power of the amplifier is possible.

====Oscillator====

An electronic oscillator is an electronic circuit that produces a periodic, oscillating electronic signal, often a sine wave or a square wave. Oscillators convert direct current (DC) from a power supply to an alternating current signal. They are widely used in many electronic devices. Common examples of signals generated by oscillators include signals broadcast by radio and television transmitters, clock signals that regulate computers and quartz clocks, and the sounds produced by electronic beepers and video games.

Oscillators are often characterized by the frequency of their output signal:
* A low-frequency oscillator (LFO) is an electronic oscillator that generates a frequency below ≈20 Hz. This term is typically used in the field of audio synthesizers, to distinguish it from an audio frequency oscillator.
* An audio oscillator produces frequencies in the audio range, about 16 Hz to 20 kHz.
* An RF oscillator produces signals in the radio frequency (RF) range of about 100 kHz to 100 GHz.

Oscillators designed to produce a high-power AC output from a DC supply are usually called inverters.

There are two main types of electronic oscillator: the linear or harmonic oscillator and the nonlinear or relaxation oscillator.

====Latches and flip-flops====
A latch or a flip-flop is a circuit that has two stable states and can be used to store state information. They typically constructed using feedback that crosses over between two arms of the circuit, to provide the circuit with a state. The circuit can be made to change state by signals applied to one or more control inputs and will have one or two outputs. It is the basic storage element in sequential logic. Latches and flip-flops are fundamental building blocks of digital electronics systems used in computers, communications, and many other types of systems.

Latches and flip-flops are used as data storage elements. Such data storage can be used for storage of &quot;state&quot;, and such a circuit is described as sequential logic. When used in a finite-state machine, the output and next state depend not only on its current input, but also on its current state (and hence, previous inputs). It can also be used for counting of pulses, and for synchronizing variably-timed input signals to some reference timing signal.

Flip-flops can be either simple (transparent or opaque) or clocked (synchronous or edge-triggered). Although the term flip-flop has historically referred generically to both simple and clocked circuits, in modern usage it is common to reserve the term &quot;flip-flop&quot; exclusively for discussing clocked circuits; the simple ones are commonly called &quot;latches&quot;.

Using this terminology, a latch is level-sensitive, whereas a flip-flop is edge-sensitive. That is, when a latch is enabled it becomes transparent, while a flip flop&#x27;s output only changes on a single type (positive going or negative going) of clock edge.

===Software===
Feedback loops provide generic mechanisms for controlling the running, maintenance, and evolution of software and computing systems. Feedback-loops are important models in the engineering of adaptive software, as they define the behaviour of the interactions among the control elements over the adaptation process, to guarantee system properties at run-time. Feedback loops and foundations of control theory have been successfully applied to computing systems. In particular, they have been applied to the development of products such as IBM Db2 and IBM Tivoli. From a software perspective, the autonomic (MAPE, monitor analyze plan execute) loop proposed by researchers of IBM is another valuable contribution to the application of feedback loops to the control of dynamic properties and the design and evolution of autonomic software systems.

==== Software Development ====
====User interface design====
Feedback is also a useful design principle for designing user interfaces.

===Video feedback===
Video feedback is the video equivalent of acoustic feedback. It involves a loop between a video camera input and a video output, e.g., a television screen or monitor. Aiming the camera at the display produces a complex video image based on the feedback.

<doc id="11547" wikidata="Q504694" url="?curid=11547" title="Furigana">
<text>is a Japanese reading aid consisting of smaller kana (syllabic characters) printed either above or next to kanji (logographic characters) or other characters to indicate their pronunciation. It is one type of ruby text. Furigana is also known as and in Japanese. In modern Japanese, it is usually used to gloss rare kanji, to clarify rare, nonstandard or ambiguous kanji readings, or in children&#x27;s or learners&#x27; materials. Before the post-World War II script reforms, it was more widespread.

Furigana is most often written in hiragana, though in certain cases it may be written in katakana, Roman alphabet letters or in other, simpler kanji. In vertical text, &quot;tategaki&quot;, the furigana is placed to the right of the line of text; in horizontal text, &quot;yokogaki&quot;, it is placed above the line of text, as illustrated below.

or


These examples spell the word &quot;nihongo&quot;, which is made up of three kanji characters: (&quot;ni&quot;, written in hiragana as ), (&quot;hon&quot;, written in hiragana as ) and (&quot;go&quot;, written in hiragana as ).

==Appearance==
Furigana may be added by character, in which case the furigana character(s) that correspond to a kanji are centered over that kanji; or by word or phrase, in which case the entire furigana text is centered over several kanji characters, even if the kanji do not represent equal shares of the kana needed to write them. The latter method is more common, especially since some words in Japanese have unique pronunciations (&quot;jukujikun&quot;) that are not related to readings of any of the characters the word is written with.

Furigana fonts are generally sized so that two kana characters fit naturally over one kanji; when more kana are required, this is resolved either by adjusting the furigana by using a condensed font (narrowing the kana), or by adjusting the kanji by intercharacter spacing (adding spaces around the kanji). In case an isolated kanji character has a long reading—for example (where reads , &quot;tazusa&quot;)—the furigana may instead spill over into the space next to the neighboring kana characters, without condensing or changing spacing. Three-kana readings are not uncommon, particularly due to &quot;yōon&quot; with a long vowel, such as ; five kana are required for and six for , the longest of any character in the Joyo kanji. Very long readings also occur for certain kanji or symbols which have a &quot;gairaigo&quot; (loan word) reading; the word &quot;centimeter&quot; is generally written as &quot;cm&quot; (with two half-width characters, so occupying one space) and has the seven-kana reading (&quot;senchimētoru&quot;) (it can also be written as the kanji , though this is very rare); another common example is &quot;%&quot; (the percent sign), which has the five kana reading (&quot;pāsento&quot;). These cause severe spacing problems due to length and these words being used as units (hence closely associated with the preceding figure).

When it is necessary to distinguish between native Japanese &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; pronunciations and Chinese-derived &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; pronunciations, for example in kanji dictionaries, the kun&#x27;yomi pronunciations are written in hiragana, and the on&#x27;yomi pronunciations are written in katakana. However, this distinction is really only important in dictionaries and other reference works. In ordinary prose, the script chosen will usually be hiragana. The one general exception to this is &quot;modern&quot; Chinese place names, personal names, and (occasionally) food names—these will often be written with kanji, and katakana used for the furigana; in more casual writing these are simply written in katakana, as borrowed words. Occasionally this style is also used for loanwords from other languages (especially English). For example, the kanji (literally &quot;one horn beast&quot;) might be glossed with katakana , &quot;yunikōn&quot;, to show the pronunciation of the loanword &quot;unicorn&quot;, which is unrelated to the normal reading of the kanji. Generally, though, such loanwords are just written in straight katakana.

The distinction between regular kana and the smaller character forms (yōon and sokuon), which are used in regular orthography to mark such things as gemination and palatalization, is often not made in furigana: for example, the usual hiragana spelling of the word (&quot;kyakka&quot;) is , but in furigana it might be written . This was especially common in old-fashioned movable type printing when smaller fonts were not available. Nowadays, with computer-based printing systems, this occurs less frequently.

==Alignment rules in word processing or typesetting==

Various word processing or typesetting software programs, such as Microsoft Word, Adobe InDesign, Adobe InCopy, etc. have features for adding ruby text, especially Japanese furigana. Among formatting features are different rules for aligning the kana over or to the right of the base text, usually either when the base text string is longer than the furigana string or vice versa. Extra spaces may be needed depending on the size of the shorter string (either the ruby string or the base string) relatively to the longer one.
* Centered, left/top or right/bottom: No spaces are added in between the characters. The shorter string is aligned to the center (中付きルビ &quot;nakatsuki rubi&quot;), the left/top (肩付きルビ &quot;katatsuki rubi&quot;) or the right/bottom of the longer string.
* 1-2-1 (JIS): Spaces are added at the start of and the end of the shorter string, and in between its component characters, so that the spaces in between are twice as wide or tall as the spaces at the start and at the end. Space width or height is calculated based on the width or height of the square bounding box of a glyph (Japanese typefaces are generally monospaced). The strings are still, in essence, aligned to the center of each other, rather than to the left/top or right/bottom.
* 0-1-0: Equal spaces are added, similarly to the 1-2-1 rule, in between the component characters of the shorter string, but not its start or end.

==Usage==

Furigana are most commonly used in works for children, who may not have sufficiently advanced reading skills to recognize the kanji, but can understand the word when written phonetically in hiragana. Because children learn hiragana before katakana, in books for very young children, there are hiragana－furigana next to the katakana characters. It is common to use furigana on all kanji characters in works for young children. This is called in Japanese.

Numeric characters used for counting (e.g. &quot;ni-hon&quot; &quot;two long things&quot;; &quot;futatsume&quot; &quot;second&quot;; &quot;dai-ni kan&quot; &quot;book 2&quot;; &quot;ni-pēji&quot; &quot;page 2&quot;; etc.) are usually not tagged with furigana. Exceptions include a few cases such as 一人/１人 &quot;hitori&quot; &quot;one person&quot; and 二人/２人 &quot;futari&quot; &quot;two people&quot;, which may be tagged with separate kana for each character (/), or non-separated kana for the whole word (/), depending on the style of the publisher in question; or characters for numerals greater than 1,000 (千), such as 万 (10,000), 億 (100,000,000), etc. Numeric words in established compounds (e.g. &quot;ippo&quot; &quot;step&quot;; &quot;hitome&quot; &quot;sight; attention&quot;), however, are generally tagged with furigana.

Many children&#x27;s manga, shōnen and shōjo manga use furigana (again however, rarely on numerals). Shōnen and shōjo manga tend to have furigana for all non-numeric characters, while some manga (such as early volumes of &quot;Doraemon&quot; and other manga published by Shogakukan), may also ignore furigana on elementary-grade kanji or easy words. Seinen and josei manga ignores furigana most of the time, even on the names of the characters if they&#x27;re common names, although some publishers may still routinely use furigana for the first mentions of important characters&#x27; names in a volume or chapter. There are also books with a phonetic guide (mainly in hiragana but sometimes in rōmaji) for Japanese learners, which may be bilingual or Japanese only. These are popular with foreigners wishing to master Japanese faster and enjoy reading Japanese short stories, novels or articles.

Due to the small type used for furigana, for maximum readability, some manga publishers may use regular kana instead of small kana. For example, はっしん &quot;hasshin&quot; may be spelled はつしん *&quot;hatsushin&quot; instead.

Some websites and tools exist which provide a phonetic guide for Japanese web pages (in hiragana, rōmaji or kiriru-moji); these are popular with both Japanese children and foreign Japanese learners.

In works aimed at adult Japanese speakers, furigana may be used on a word written in uncommon kanji; in the mass media, they are generally used on words containing non-Jōyō kanji.

Furigana commonly appear alongside kanji names and their romanizations on signs for railway stations, even if the pronunciation of the kanji is commonly known. Furigana also appear often on maps to show the pronunciation of unusual place names.

Before the war, youths might arguably have been almost illiterate if not for furigana.

===Names===
Japanese names are usually written in kanji. Because there are many possible readings for kanji names, including special name-only readings called nanori, furigana are often used to give the readings of names. On Japanese official forms, where the name is to be written, there is always an adjacent column for the name to be written in furigana.

Furigana may also be used for foreign names written in kanji. Chinese and Korean names are the most common examples: Chinese names are usually pronounced with Japanese readings and the pronunciation written in hiragana, while Korean names are usually pronounced with Korean readings and the pronunciation written in katakana.

===Language learning===
Kanji and kanji compounds are often presented with furigana in Japanese-language textbooks for non-native speakers.

Furigana are also often used in foreign-language textbooks for Japanese learners to indicate pronunciation. The words are written in the original foreign script, such as hangul for Korean, and furigana is used to indicate the pronunciation. According to Ministry of Education guidelines, and the opinions of educators, the use of Japanese furigana should be avoided in English teaching due to the differences in pronunciation between English and Japanese. For instance, the word &quot;birthdate&quot; might be glossed in furigana as (&quot;bāsudeito&quot;), which corresponds to an imperfect pronunciation.

===Other effects===
Furigana unrelated to the kanji they are assigned to are often used to convey certain effects, rather than to denote a phonetic guide, especially in manga, anime, video games, and tabletop games.
This usage is known as &quot;gikun&quot; (see also Kanji#Special readings). The specific effects vary.

It may be used to visually reinforce complex ideas without having to use long expressions. For example, the word &quot;akumu&quot; &quot;nightmare&quot; may be annotated with &quot;shinjitsu&quot; &quot;truth&quot; (i.e. ) rather than its true reading, to convey the meaning of &quot;nightmarish truth&quot;.
Some authors may even use furigana that means the opposite of what the base text does to reinforce the complicated relationship between characters. For example, &quot;shin&#x27;yū&quot; &quot;close friend&quot; may be annotated with &quot;raibaru&quot; &quot;rival&quot;, to mean &quot;a rival who is also friend&quot;.

Another use is to indicate the meanings of ambiguous or foreign words. For example, the word (&quot;koko&quot;, &quot;here&quot;) may be annotated with a more specific description like &quot;byōin&quot; &quot;hospital&quot; (i.e. ) to mean &quot;here (at this hospital)&quot;. Or in a work of science fiction, an astronaut may use the word &quot;furusato&quot; &quot;my hometown&quot;, when referring to planet Earth; to clarify that for the reader, may be written over the word &quot;chikyū&quot; &quot;Earth&quot;. A similar technique is used in Japanese subtitles on foreign films to associate the written Japanese with the sounds actually being spoken by the actors, or in a translation of a work of fiction to preserve the original sound of a proper name in furigana while indicating its meaning with kanji. For example, &quot;Firebolt&quot; in the Harry Potter series is written , composed of the kanji &quot;honō no ikazuchi&quot; &quot;flame thunderbolt&quot; and the furigana &quot;faiaboruto&quot;.

Some manga combine the rendition of a foreign word (especially an obscure one) in furigana as the intended reading of a term, with more familiar kanji as the meaning. For example, &quot;eki&quot; &quot;station&quot; may be annotated with &quot;sutēshon&quot; (the rendition of the English &quot;station&quot;) to convey a foreign, exotic feel;
This is sometimes done conversely, for example, by annotating an exotic term like &quot;bēze&quot; &quot;kiss&quot; with a more common synonym like &quot;kissu&quot;.

Some writers use furigana to represent slang pronunciations, particularly those that would be difficult to understand without the kanji to provide their meaning. Others use it simply to shrink kana spellings that are too long, thanks to the small type of furigana. For example, &quot;intāpōru&quot; &quot;Interpol&quot; may be shortened to .

In karaoke it is common for furigana to be placed on the song lyrics. The song lyrics are often written in kanji pronounced quite differently from the furigana. The furigana version is used for pronunciation.

==Other Japanese reading aids==
===Okurigana===

Okurigana are kana that appear inline at normal size following kanji stems, typically to complete and to inflect adjectives and verbs. In this use they may also help to disambiguate kanji with multiple readings; for example, (, &quot;agaru&quot;) vs. (, &quot;noboru&quot;). Unlike furigana, the use of okurigana is a mandatory part of the written language.

===Kunten===

In the written style known as &quot;kanbun&quot;, which is the Japanese approximation of Classical Chinese, small marks called &quot;kunten&quot; are sometimes added as reading aids. Unlike furigana, which indicate pronunciation, &quot;kunten&quot; indicate Japanese grammatical structures absent from the &quot;kanbun&quot;, and also show how words should be reordered to fit Japanese sentence structure.

===Furikanji===
Furigana are sometimes also used to indicate meaning, rather than pronunciation. Over the foreign text, smaller-sized Japanese words, in kana or kanji, corresponding to the &quot;meaning&quot; of the foreign words, effectively translate it in place. While rare now, some late 19th–early 20th century authors used kanji as furigana for loanwords written in katakana. This usage is called in Japanese, since &quot;furigana&quot; implies the use of &quot;kana&quot;. For example, &quot;ririkku&quot; &quot;lyric&quot; may be tagged with &quot;kashi&quot; &quot;lyrics&quot; for clarification rather than for phonetic guidance.

<text>Francis II and I (; 12 February 1768 – 2 March 1835) was the last Holy Roman Emperor as Francis II from 1792 to 1806, and the first Emperor of Austria as Francis I from 1804 to 1835. He was also King of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia, and served as the first president of the German Confederation following its establishment in 1815.

The eldest son of future Emperor Leopold II and Maria Luisa of Spain, Francis was born in Florence, where his father ruled as Grand Duke of Tuscany. Leopold became Holy Roman Emperor in 1790 but died two years later, and Francis succeeded him. His empire immediately became embroiled in the French Revolutionary Wars, the first of which ended in Austrian defeat and the loss of the left bank of the Rhine to France. After another French victory in the War of the Second Coalition, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French. In response, Francis assumed the title of Emperor of Austria. He continued his leading role as Napoleon&#x27;s adversary in the Napoleonic Wars, and suffered successive defeats that greatly weakened Austria as a European power. In 1806, after Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, Francis abdicated as Holy Roman Emperor, which in effect marked the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. Following the defeat of the Fifth Coalition, Francis ceded more territory to France and was forced to wed his daughter Marie Louise to Napoleon.

In 1813, Francis turned against Napoleon and finally defeated him in the War of the Sixth Coalition, forcing the French emperor to abdicate. Austria took part as a leading member of the Holy Alliance at the Congress of Vienna, which was largely dominated by Francis&#x27; chancellor Klemens von Metternich, culminating in a new European order and the restoration of most of Francis&#x27; ancient dominions. Due to the establishment of the Concert of Europe, which resisted popular nationalist and liberal tendencies, Francis was viewed as a reactionary later in his reign. Francis died in 1835 at the age of 67 and was succeeded by his son, Ferdinand I.

== Early life ==

Francis was a son of Emperor Leopold II (1747–1792) and his wife Maria Luisa of Spain (1745–1792), daughter of Charles III of Spain. Francis was born in Florence, the capital of Tuscany, where his father reigned as Grand Duke from 1765 to 1790. Though he had a happy childhood surrounded by his many siblings, his family knew Francis was likely to be a future Emperor (his uncle Joseph had no surviving issue from either of his two marriages), and so in 1784 the young Archduke was sent to the Imperial Court in Vienna to educate and prepare him for his future role.

Emperor Joseph II himself took charge of Francis&#x27; development. His disciplinarian regime was a stark contrast to the indulgent Florentine Court of Leopold. The Emperor wrote that Francis was &quot;stunted in growth&quot;, &quot;backward in bodily dexterity and deportment&quot;, and &quot;neither more nor less than a spoiled mother&#x27;s child.&quot; Joseph concluded that &quot;the manner in which he was treated for upwards of sixteen years could not but have confirmed him in the delusion that the preservation of his own person was the only thing of importance.&quot;

Joseph&#x27;s martinet method of improving the young Francis was &quot;fear and unpleasantness.&quot; The young Archduke was isolated, the reasoning being that this would make him more self-sufficient as it was felt by Joseph that Francis &quot;failed to lead himself, to do his own thinking.&quot; Nonetheless, Francis greatly admired his uncle, if rather in fear of him. To complete his training, Francis was sent to join an army regiment in Hungary and he settled easily into the routine of military life. He was present at the siege of Belgrade which occurred during the Austro-Turkish War.

After the death of Joseph II in 1790, Francis&#x27; father became Emperor. He had an early taste of power while acting as Leopold&#x27;s deputy in Vienna while the incoming Emperor traversed the Empire attempting to win back those alienated by his brother&#x27;s policies. The strain took a toll on Leopold and by the winter of 1791, he became ill. He gradually worsened throughout early 1792; on the afternoon of 1 March Leopold died, at the relatively young age of 44. Francis, just past his 24th birthday, was now Emperor, much sooner than he had expected.

== Emperor ==
=== Wars with France ===

As the head of the Holy Roman Empire and the ruler of the vast realms of Central and Eastern Europe, Francis felt threatened by the French revolutionaries and later Napoleon&#x27;s expansionism as well as their social and political reforms which were being exported throughout Europe in the wake of the conquering French armies. Francis had a fraught relationship with France. His aunt Marie Antoinette, the wife of Louis XVI and Queen consort of France, was guillotined by the revolutionaries in 1793, at the beginning of his reign, although, on the whole, he was indifferent to her fate.Later, he led the Holy Roman Empire into the French Revolutionary Wars. He briefly commanded the Allied forces during the Flanders Campaign of 1794 before handing over command to his brother Archduke Charles. He was later defeated by Napoleon. By the Treaty of Campo Formio, he ceded the left bank of the Rhine to France in exchange for Venice and Dalmatia. He again fought against France during the War of the Second Coalition.

On 11 August 1804, in response to Napoleon crowning himself as emperor of the French earlier that year, he announced that he would henceforth assume the title of hereditary emperor of Austria as Francis I, a move that technically was illegal in terms of imperial law. Yet Napoleon had agreed beforehand and therefore it happened.

=== Napoleonic Wars ===
During the War of the Third Coalition, the Austrian forces met a crushing defeat at Austerlitz, and Francis had to agree to the Treaty of Pressburg, which greatly weakened Austria and brought about the final collapse of the Holy Roman Empire. In July 1806, under massive pressure from France, Bavaria and fifteen other German states ratified the statutes founding the Confederation of the Rhine, with Napoleon designated Protector, and they announced to the Imperial Diet their intention to leave the Empire with immediate effect. Then, on 22 July, Napoleon issued an ultimatum to Francis demanding that he abdicate as Holy Roman Emperor by 10 August.

Five days later, Francis bowed to the inevitable and, without mentioning the ultimatum, affirmed that since the Peace of Pressburg he had tried his best to fulfil his duties as emperor but that circumstances had convinced him that he could no longer rule according to his oath of office, the formation of the Confederation of the Rhine making that impossible. He added that &quot;we hereby decree that we regard the bond which until now tied us to the states of the Empire as dissolved&quot; in effect dissolving the empire. At the same time he declared the complete and formal withdrawal of his hereditary lands from imperial jurisdiction. After that date, he continued to reign as Francis I, Emperor of Austria.

In 1809, Francis, deeming another war with France as inevitable and influenced by hawks in Vienna, attacked France again, hoping to take advantage of the Peninsular War embroiling Napoleon in Spain. He was again defeated, and this time forced to ally himself with Napoleon, ceding territory to the Empire, joining the Continental System, and wedding his daughter Marie-Louise to the Emperor. The Napoleonic Wars drastically weakened Austria, making it entirely landlocked and threatened its preeminence among the states of Germany, a position that it would eventually cede to the Kingdom of Prussia.

In 1813, for the fifth and final time, Austria turned against France and joined Great Britain, Russia, Prussia and Sweden in their war against Napoleon. Austria played a major role in the final defeat of France—in recognition of this, Francis, represented by Clemens von Metternich, presided over the Congress of Vienna, helping to form the Concert of Europe and the Holy Alliance, ushering in an era of conservatism in Europe. The German Confederation, a loose association of Central European states was created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to organize the surviving states of the Holy Roman Empire. The Congress was a personal triumph for Francis, who hosted the assorted dignitaries in comfort, though Francis undermined his allies Tsar Alexander and Frederick William III of Prussia by negotiating a secret treaty with the restored French king Louis XVIII.

=== Domestic policy ===
The violent events of the French Revolution impressed themselves deeply into the mind of Francis (as well as all other European monarchs), and he came to distrust radicalism in any form. In 1794, a &quot;Jacobin&quot; conspiracy was discovered in the Austrian and Hungarian armies. The leaders were put on trial, but the verdicts only skirted the perimeter of the conspiracy. Francis&#x27; brother Alexander Leopold (at that time Palatine of Hungary) wrote to the Emperor admitting &quot;Although we have caught a lot of the culprits, we have not really got to the bottom of this business yet.&quot; Nonetheless, two officers heavily implicated in the conspiracy were hanged and gibbeted, while numerous others were sentenced to imprisonment (many of whom died from the conditions)
Francis was from his experiences suspicious and set up an extensive network of police spies and censors to monitor dissent (in this he was following his father&#x27;s lead, as the Grand Duchy of Tuscany had the most effective secret police in Europe). Even his family did not escape attention. His brothers, the Archdukes Charles and Johann had their meetings and activities spied upon. Censorship was also prevalent. The author Franz Grillparzer, a Habsburg patriot, had one play suppressed solely as a &quot;precautionary&quot; measure. When Grillparzer met the censor responsible, he asked him what was objectionable about the work. The censor replied, &quot;Oh, nothing at all. But I thought to myself, &#x27;One can never tell&#x27;.&quot;

In military affairs Francis had allowed his brother, the Archduke Charles, extensive control over the army during the Napoleonic wars. Yet, distrustful of allowing any individual too much power, he otherwise maintained the separation of command functions between the Hofkriegsrat and his field commanders. In the later years of his reign he limited military spending, requiring it not exceed forty million florins per year; because of inflation this resulted in inadequate funding, with the army&#x27;s share of the budget shrinking from half in 1817 to only twenty-three percent in 1830.

Francis presented himself as an open and approachable monarch (he regularly set aside two mornings each week to meet with his imperial subjects, regardless of status, by appointment in his office, even speaking to them in their own language), but his will was sovereign. In 1804, he had no compunction about announcing that through his authority as Holy Roman Emperor, he declared he was now Emperor of Austria (at the time a geographical term that had little resonance). Two years later, Francis personally wound up the moribund Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. Both actions were of dubious constitutional legality.

To increase patriotic sentiment during the war with France, the anthem &quot;Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser&quot; was composed in 1797 to be sung as the Kaiserhymne to music by Joseph Haydn. The lyrics were adapted for later Emperors and the music lives on as the German national anthem &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot;.

== Death ==

On 2 March 1835, 43 years and a day after his father&#x27;s death, Francis died in Vienna of a sudden fever aged 67, in the presence of many of his family and with all the religious comforts. His funeral was magnificent, with his Viennese subjects respectfully filing past his coffin in the court chapel of the Hofburg palace for three days. Francis was interred in the traditional resting place of Habsburg monarchs, the Imperial Crypt in Vienna&#x27;s Neue Markt Square. He is buried in tomb number 57, surrounded by tombs of his four wives.Francis passed on a main point in the political testament he left for his son and heir Ferdinand: to &quot;preserve unity in the family and regard it as one of the highest goods.&quot; In many portraits (particularly those painted by Peter Fendi) he was portrayed as the patriarch of a loving family, surrounded by his children and grandchildren.

== Marriages ==

Francis II married four times:

# On 6 January 1788, to Elisabeth of Württemberg (21 April 1767 – 18 February 1790).
# On 15 September 1790, to his double first cousin Maria Teresa of the Two Sicilies (6 June 1772 – 13 April 1807), daughter of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies (both were grandchildren of Empress Maria Theresa and shared all of their other grandparents in common), with whom he had twelve children, of whom only seven reached adulthood.
# On 6 January 1808, he married again to another first cousin, Maria Ludovika of Austria-Este (14 December 1787 – 7 April 1816) with no issue. She was the daughter of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este and Maria Beatrice d&#x27;Este, Princess of Modena.
# On 29 October 1816, to Karoline Charlotte Auguste of Bavaria (8 February 1792 – 9 February 1873) with no issue. She was daughter of Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and had been previously married to William I of Württemberg.

== Children ==
From his first wife Elisabeth of Württemberg, one daughter, who died in infancy, and his second wife Maria Teresa of the Two Sicilies, eight daughters and four sons, of whom five died in infancy or childhood:

=== Titles ===
From 1806 he used the grand title of the emperor of Austria: 

From 1804 with the proclamation of the Empire of Austria until his abdication as Holy Roman Emperor in 1806 his grand title started &quot;By the Grace of God anointed Roman Emperor, ever Increaser of the Realm and King in Germania (&quot;&quot;von Gottes Gnaden erwählter Römischer Kaiser, zu allen Zeiten Mehrer des Reichs sowie König in Germanien&quot;).

<text>Sir Frederick Augustus Abel, 1st Baronet (17 July 18276 September 1902) was an English chemist who was recognised as the leading British authority on explosives. He is best known for the invention of cordite as a replacement for gunpowder in firearms.

==Education==
Born in London as son of Johann Leopold Abel, Abel studied chemistry at the Royal Polytechnic Institution and in 1845 became one of the original 26 students of A. W. von Hofmann at the Royal College of Chemistry (now a constituent of Imperial College London). In 1852 he was appointed lecturer in chemistry at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, succeeding Michael Faraday, who had held that post since 1829.

==Early career==
From 1854 until 1888 Abel served as ordnance chemist at the Chemical Establishment of the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, establishing himself as the leading British authority on explosives. Three years later was appointed chemist to the War Department and chemical referee to the government. During his tenure of this office, which lasted until 1888, he carried out a large amount of work in connection with the chemistry of explosives.

==Notable work==
One of the most important of his investigations had to do with the manufacture of guncotton, and he developed a process, consisting essentially of reducing the nitrated cotton to fine pulp, which enabled it to be safely manufactured and at the same time yielded the product in a form that increased its usefulness. This work to an important extent prepared the way for the &quot;smokeless powders&quot; which came into general use towards the end of the 19th century; cordite, the type adopted by the British government in 1891, was invented jointly by him and Sir James Dewar. He and Dewar were unsuccessfully sued by Alfred Nobel over infringement of Nobel&#x27;s patent for a similar explosive called ballistite, the case finally being resolved in the House of Lords in 1895. He also extensively researched the behaviour of black powder when ignited, with the Scottish physicist Sir Andrew Noble. At the request of the British government, he devised the Abel test, a means of determining the flash point of petroleum products. His first instrument, the open-test apparatus, was specified in an Act of Parliament in 1868 for officially specifying petroleum products. It was superseded in August 1879 by the much more reliable Abel close-test instrument. Under his leadership, first, guncotton was developed at Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills, patented in 1865, then, the propellant cordite, patented in 1889. In electricity, Abel studied the construction of electrical fuses and other applications of electricity to warlike purposes.

==Leadership and honours==
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1860 and received their Royal Medal in 1887. He was president of the Chemical Society (1875–77), of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (then the Society of Telegraph Engineers) (1877), of the Institute of Chemistry (1881–82) and of the Society of Chemical Industry (1882–83). He was also president of the Iron and Steel Institute in 1891 and was awarded the Bessemer Gold Medal in 1897 for his work on problems of steel manufacture. He was awarded the Telford Medal by the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1879.

He was made a Commander of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1877. and knighted on 20 April 1883 
He took an important part in the work of the Inventions Exhibition (London) in 1885, and in 1887 became organizing secretary and first director of the Imperial Institute, a position he held till his death in 1902. He was Rede Lecturer and received an honorary doctorate from Cambridge University in 1888. He was upgraded Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on 3 February 1891, created a baronet, of Cadogan Place in the Parish of Chelsea in the County of London, on 25 May 1893 and made a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) on 8 March 1901.

Abel died at his residence in Whitehall Court, London, on 6 September 1902, aged 75, and was buried in Nunhead Cemetery, London. The baronetcy became extinct on his death.

==Family==
Abel married twice; first to Sarah Blanch, daughter of James Blanch, of Bristol; secondly after his first wife&#x27;s death to Giulietta de La Feuillade. He left no children.
==Books==
*&quot;Handbook of Chemistry&quot; (with C. L. Bloxam)
*&quot;The Modern History of Gunpowder&quot; (1866)
*&quot;Gun-cotton&quot; (1866)
*&quot;On Explosive Agents&quot; (1872)
*&quot;Researches in Explosives&quot; (1875)
*&quot;Electricity applied to Explosive Purposes&quot; (1898)

He also wrote several articles in the ninth edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.
