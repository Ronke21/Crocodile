<text>Geology () is a branch of natural science concerned with the Earth and other astronomical objects, the rocks of which they are composed, and the processes by which they change over time. Modern geology significantly overlaps all other Earth sciences, including hydrology. It is integrated with Earth system science and planetary science.

Geology describes the structure of the Earth on and beneath its surface and the processes that have shaped that structure. Geologists study the mineralogical composition of rocks in order to get insight into their history of formation. Geology determines the relative ages of rocks found at a given location; geochemistry (a branch of geology) determines their absolute ages. By combining various petrological, crystallographic, and paleontological tools, geologists are able to chronicle the geological history of the Earth as a whole. One aspect is to demonstrate the age of the Earth. Geology provides evidence for plate tectonics, the evolutionary history of life, and the Earth&#x27;s past climates.

Geologists broadly study the properties and processes of Earth and other terrestrial planets. Geologists use a wide variety of methods to understand the Earth&#x27;s structure and evolution, including fieldwork, rock description, geophysical techniques, chemical analysis, physical experiments, and numerical modelling. In practical terms, geology is important for mineral and hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, evaluating water resources, understanding natural hazards, remediating environmental problems, and providing insights into past climate change. Geology is a major academic discipline, and it is central to geological engineering and plays an important role in geotechnical engineering.

==Geological material==
The majority of geological data comes from research on solid Earth materials. Meteorites and other extraterrestrial natural materials are also studied by geological methods.

===Minerals===

Minerals are naturally occurring elements and compounds with a definite homogeneous chemical composition and an ordered atomic arrangement.

Each mineral has distinct physical properties, and there are many tests to determine each of them. Minerals are often identified through these tests. The specimens can be tested for:
* Color: Minerals are grouped by their color. Mostly diagnostic but impurities can change a mineral&#x27;s color.
* Streak: Performed by scratching the sample on a porcelain plate. The color of the streak can help identify the mineral.
* Hardness: The resistance of a mineral to scratching or indentation.
* Breakage pattern: A mineral can either show fracture or cleavage, the former being breakage of uneven surfaces, and the latter a breakage along closely spaced parallel planes.
* Luster: Quality of light reflected from the surface of a mineral. Examples are metallic, pearly, waxy, dull.
* Specific gravity: the weight of a specific volume of a mineral.
* Effervescence: Involves dripping hydrochloric acid on the mineral to test for fizzing.
* Magnetism: Involves using a magnet to test for magnetism.
* Taste: Minerals can have a distinctive taste such as halite (which tastes like table salt).

===Rock===


A rock is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloids. Most research in geology is associated with the study of rocks, as they provide the primary record of the majority of the geological history of the Earth. There are three major types of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. The rock cycle
illustrates the relationships among them (see diagram).

When a rock solidifies or crystallizes from melt (magma or lava), it is an igneous rock. This rock can be weathered and eroded, then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rocks are mainly divided into four categories: sandstone, shale, carbonate, and evaporite. This group of classifications focuses partly on the size of sedimentary particles (sandstone and shale), and partly on mineralogy and formation processes (carbonation and evaporation). Igneous and sedimentary rocks can then be turned into metamorphic rocks by heat and pressure that change its mineral content, resulting in a characteristic fabric. All three types may melt again, and when this happens, new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once again solidify.
Organic matter, such as coal, bitumen, oil, and natural gas, is linked mainly to organic-rich sedimentary rocks.

To study all three types of rock, geologists evaluate the minerals of which they are composed and their other physical properties, such as texture and fabric.

===Unlithified material===
Geologists also study unlithified materials (referred to as &quot;superficial deposits&quot;) that lie above the bedrock. This study is often known as Quaternary geology, after the Quaternary period of geologic history, which is the most recent period of geologic time.

====Magma====
Magma is the original unlithified source of all igneous rocks. The active flow of molten rock is closely studied in volcanology, and igneous petrology aims to determine the history of igneous rocks from their original molten source to their final crystallization.

==Whole-Earth structure==

===Plate tectonics===

In the 1960s, it was discovered that the Earth&#x27;s lithosphere, which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle, is separated into tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming, solid, upper mantle, which is called the asthenosphere. This theory is supported by several types of observations, including seafloor spreading and the global distribution of mountain terrain and seismicity.

There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle (that is, the heat transfer caused by the slow movement of ductile mantle rock). Thus, oceanic parts of plates and the adjoining mantle convection currents always move in the same direction – because the oceanic lithosphere is actually the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle. This coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics.

The development of plate tectonics has provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid Earth. Long linear regions of geological features are explained as plate boundaries:
* Mid-ocean ridges, high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist, are seen as divergent boundaries, where two plates move apart.
* Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes are theorized as convergent boundaries, where one plate subducts, or moves, under another.
* Transform boundaries, such as the San Andreas Fault system, are where plates slide horizontally past each other. 

Plate tectonics has provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener&#x27;s theory of continental drift, in which the continents move across the surface of the Earth over geological time. They also provided a driving force for crustal deformation, and a new setting for the observations of structural geology. The power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.

===Earth structure===


Advances in seismology, computer modeling, and mineralogy and crystallography at high temperatures and pressures give insights into the internal composition and structure of the Earth.

Seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves to image the interior of the Earth. Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a lithosphere (including crust) on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.

Mineralogists have been able to use the pressure and temperature data from the seismic and modeling studies alongside knowledge of the elemental composition of the Earth to reproduce these conditions in experimental settings and measure changes within the crystal structure. These studies explain the chemical changes associated with the major seismic discontinuities in the mantle and show the crystallographic structures expected in the inner core of the Earth.
==Geological time==
The geological time scale encompasses the history of the Earth. It is bracketed at the earliest by the dates of the first Solar System material at 4.567 Ga (or 4.567 billion years ago) and the formation of the Earth at
4.54 Ga
(4.54 billion years), which is the beginning of the Hadean eona division of geological time. At the later end of the scale, it is marked by the present day (in the Holocene epoch).

==Dating methods==

===Relative dating===

Methods for relative dating were developed when geology first emerged as a natural science. Geologists still use the following principles today as a means to provide information about geological history and the timing of geological events.

The &quot;principle of uniformitarianism&quot; states that the geological processes observed in operation that modify the Earth&#x27;s crust at present have worked in much the same way over geological time. A fundamental principle of geology advanced by the 18th-century Scottish physician and geologist James Hutton is that &quot;the present is the key to the past.&quot; In Hutton&#x27;s words: &quot;the past history of our globe must be explained by what can be seen to be happening now.&quot;

The &quot;principle of intrusive relationships&quot; concerns crosscutting intrusions. In geology, when an igneous intrusion cuts across a formation of sedimentary rock, it can be determined that the igneous intrusion is younger than the sedimentary rock. Different types of intrusions include stocks, laccoliths, batholiths, sills and dikes.

The &quot;principle of cross-cutting relationships&quot; pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault.

The &quot;principle of inclusions and components&quot; states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or &quot;clasts&quot;) are found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them. For example, in sedimentary rocks, it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer. A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found. These foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to cool in the matrix. As a result, xenoliths are older than the rock that contains them.
The &quot;principle of original horizontality&quot; states that the deposition of sediments occurs as essentially horizontal beds. Observation of modern marine and non-marine sediments in a wide variety of environments supports this generalization (although cross-bedding is inclined, the overall orientation of cross-bedded units is horizontal).

The &quot;principle of superposition&quot; states that a sedimentary rock layer in a tectonically undisturbed sequence is younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it. Logically a younger layer cannot slip beneath a layer previously deposited. This principle allows sedimentary layers to be viewed as a form of the vertical timeline, a partial or complete record of the time elapsed from deposition of the lowest layer to deposition of the highest bed.

The &quot;principle of faunal succession&quot; is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks. As organisms exist during the same period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence provides a relative age of the formations where they appear. Based on principles that William Smith laid out almost a hundred years before the publication of Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution, the principles of succession developed independently of evolutionary thought. The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat (facies change in sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils formed globally at the same time.

===Absolute dating===

Geologists also use methods to determine the absolute age of rock samples and geological events. These dates are useful on their own and may also be used in conjunction with relative dating methods or to calibrate relative methods.

At the beginning of the 20th century, advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geological events using radioactive isotopes and other methods. This changed the understanding of geological time. Previously, geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another. With isotopic dates, it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units, and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages.

For many geological applications, isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature, the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice. These are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies. Common methods include uranium–lead dating, potassium–argon dating, argon–argon dating and uranium–thorium dating. These methods are used for a variety of applications. Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units that do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques. These methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement.
Thermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust, the uplift of mountain ranges, and paleo-topography.

Fractionation of the lanthanide series elements is used to compute ages since rocks were removed from the mantle.

Other methods are used for more recent events. Optically stimulated luminescence and cosmogenic radionuclide dating are used to date surfaces and/or erosion rates. Dendrochronology can also be used for the dating of landscapes. Radiocarbon dating is used for geologically young materials containing organic carbon.

==Geological development of an area==

The geology of an area changes through time as rock units are deposited and inserted, and deformational processes alter their shapes and locations.

Rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrusion into the overlying rock. Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows blanket the surface. Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.

After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side (strike-slip) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.

When rock units are placed under horizontal compression, they shorten and become thicker. Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through faulting and folding. In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which causes the deeper rock to move on top of the shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating &quot;antiforms&quot;, or where it buckles downwards, creating &quot;synforms&quot;. If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms, and synforms.
Even higher pressures and temperatures during horizontal shortening can cause both folding and metamorphism of the rocks. This metamorphism causes changes in the mineral composition of the rocks; creates a foliation, or planar surface, that is related to mineral growth under stress. This can remove signs of the original textures of the rocks, such as bedding in sedimentary rocks, flow features of lavas, and crystal patterns in crystalline rocks.

Extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner. This is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning. Normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower. This typically results in younger units ending up below older units. Stretching of units can result in their thinning. In fact, at one location within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt, the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon appears over a length of less than a meter. Rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed. These stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses, known as &quot;boudins&quot;, after the French word for &quot;sausage&quot; because of their visual similarity.

Where rock units slide past one another, strike-slip faults develop in shallow regions, and become shear zones at deeper depths where the rocks deform ductilely.
The addition of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation. Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients, causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down. Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. Dikes, long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed. This can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano.

All of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment and do not necessarily occur in a single order. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is indiscernible without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area.

==Investigative methods==
Geologists use a number of fields, laboratory, and numerical modeling methods to decipher Earth history and to understand the processes that occur on and inside the Earth. In typical geological investigations, geologists use primary information related to petrology (the study of rocks), stratigraphy (the study of sedimentary layers), and structural geology (the study of positions of rock units and their deformation). In many cases, geologists also study modern soils, rivers, landscapes, and glaciers; investigate past and current life and biogeochemical pathways, and use geophysical methods to investigate the subsurface. Sub-specialities of geology may distinguish endogenous and exogenous geology.

===Field methods===


Geological field work varies depending on the task at hand. Typical fieldwork could consist of:
* Geological mapping
** Structural mapping: identifying the locations of major rock units and the faults and folds that led to their placement there.
** Stratigraphic mapping: pinpointing the locations of sedimentary facies (lithofacies and biofacies) or the mapping of isopachs of equal thickness of sedimentary rock
** Surficial mapping: recording the locations of soils and surficial deposits
* Surveying of topographic features
** compilation of topographic maps
** Work to understand change across landscapes, including:
*** Patterns of erosion and deposition
*** River-channel change through migration and avulsion
*** Hillslope processes
* Subsurface mapping through geophysical methods
** These methods include:
*** Shallow seismic surveys
*** Ground-penetrating radar
*** Aeromagnetic surveys
*** Electrical resistivity tomography
** They aid in:
*** Hydrocarbon exploration
*** Finding groundwater
*** Locating buried archaeological artifacts
* High-resolution stratigraphy
** Measuring and describing stratigraphic sections on the surface
** Well drilling and logging
* Biogeochemistry and geomicrobiology
** Collecting samples to:
*** determine biochemical pathways
*** identify new species of organisms
*** identify new chemical compounds
** and to use these discoveries to:
*** understand early life on Earth and how it functioned and metabolized
*** find important compounds for use in pharmaceuticals
* Paleontology: excavation of fossil material
** For research into past life and evolution
** For museums and education
* Collection of samples for geochronology and thermochronology
* Glaciology: measurement of characteristics of glaciers and their motion

===Petrology===
In addition to identifying rocks in the field (lithology), petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory. Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe. In an optical mineralogy analysis, petrologists analyze thin sections of rock samples using a petrographic microscope, where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light, including their birefringence, pleochroism, twinning, and interference properties with a conoscopic lens. In the electron microprobe, individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals. Stable and radioactive isotope studies provide insight into the geochemical evolution of rock units.

Petrologists can also use fluid inclusion data and perform high temperature and pressure physical experiments to understand the temperatures and pressures at which different mineral phases appear, and how they change through igneous and metamorphic processes. This research can be extrapolated to the field to understand metamorphic processes and the conditions of crystallization of igneous rocks. This work can also help to explain processes that occur within the Earth, such as subduction and magma chamber evolution.
===Structural geology===

Structural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geological samples to observe the fabric within the rocks, which gives information about strain within the crystalline structure of the rocks. They also plot and combine measurements of geological structures to better understand the orientations of faults and folds to reconstruct the history of rock deformation in the area. In addition, they perform analog and numerical experiments of rock deformation in large and small settings.

The analysis of structures is often accomplished by plotting the orientations of various features onto stereonets. A stereonet is a stereographic projection of a sphere onto a plane, in which planes are projected as lines and lines are projected as points. These can be used to find the locations of fold axes, relationships between faults, and relationships between other geological structures.

Among the most well-known experiments in structural geology are those involving orogenic wedges, which are zones in which mountains are built along convergent tectonic plate boundaries. In the analog versions of these experiments, horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a back stop, which results in realistic-looking patterns of faulting and the growth of a critically tapered (all angles remain the same) orogenic wedge. Numerical models work in the same way as these analog models, though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt. This helps to show the relationship between erosion and the shape of a mountain range. These studies can also give useful information about pathways for metamorphism through pressure, temperature, space, and time.

===Stratigraphy===
In the laboratory, stratigraphers analyze samples of stratigraphic sections that can be returned from the field, such as those from drill cores. Stratigraphers also analyze data from geophysical surveys that show the locations of stratigraphic units in the subsurface. Geophysical data and well logs can be combined to produce a better view of the subsurface, and stratigraphers often use computer programs to do this in three dimensions. Stratigraphers can then use these data to reconstruct ancient processes occurring on the surface of the Earth, interpret past environments, and locate areas for water, coal, and hydrocarbon extraction.

In the laboratory, biostratigraphers analyze rock samples from outcrop and drill cores for the fossils found in them. These fossils help scientists to date the core and to understand the depositional environment in which the rock units formed. Geochronologists precisely date rocks within the stratigraphic section to provide better absolute bounds on the timing and rates of deposition.
Magnetic stratigraphers look for signs of magnetic reversals in igneous rock units within the drill cores. Other scientists perform stable-isotope studies on the rocks to gain information about past climate.

==Planetary geology==

With the advent of space exploration in the twentieth century, geologists have begun to look at other planetary bodies in the same ways that have been developed to study the Earth. This new field of study is called planetary geology (sometimes known as astrogeology) and relies on known geological principles to study other bodies of the solar system. This is a major aspect of planetary science, and largely focuses on the terrestrial planets, icy moons, asteroids, comets, and meteorites. However, some planetary geophysicists study the giant planets and exoplanets.

Although the Greek-language-origin prefix &quot;&quot; refers to Earth, &quot;geology&quot; is often used in conjunction with the names of other planetary bodies when describing their composition and internal processes: examples are &quot;the geology of Mars&quot; and &quot;Lunar geology&quot;. Specialized terms such as &quot;selenology&quot; (studies of the Moon), &quot;areology&quot; (of Mars), etc., are also in use.

Although planetary geologists are interested in studying all aspects of other planets, a significant focus is to search for evidence of past or present life on other worlds. This has led to many missions whose primary or ancillary purpose is to examine planetary bodies for evidence of life. One of these is the Phoenix lander, which analyzed Martian polar soil for water, chemical, and mineralogical constituents related to biological processes.

==Applied geology==
===Economic geology===
Economic geology is a branch of geology that deals with aspects of economic minerals that humankind uses to fulfill various needs. Economic minerals are those extracted profitably for various practical uses. Economic geologists help locate and manage the Earth&#x27;s natural resources, such as petroleum and coal, as well as mineral resources, which include metals such as iron, copper, and uranium.

====Mining geology====

Mining geology consists of the extractions of mineral and ore resources from the Earth. Some resources of economic interests include gemstones, metals such as gold and copper, and many minerals such as asbestos, Magnesite, perlite, mica, phosphates, zeolites, clay, pumice, quartz, and silica, as well as elements such as sulfur, chlorine, and helium.

====Petroleum geology====
Petroleum geologists study the locations of the subsurface of the Earth that can contain extractable hydrocarbons, especially petroleum and natural gas. Because many of these reservoirs are found in sedimentary basins, they study the formation of these basins, as well as their sedimentary and tectonic evolution and the present-day positions of the rock units.

===Engineering geology===

Engineering geology is the application of geological principles to engineering practice for the purpose of assuring that the geological factors affecting the location, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of engineering works are properly addressed. Engineering geology is distinct from geological engineering, particularly in North America.
In the field of civil engineering, geological principles and analyses are used in order to ascertain the mechanical principles of the material on which structures are built. This allows tunnels to be built without collapsing, bridges and skyscrapers to be built with sturdy foundations, and buildings to be built that will not settle in clay and mud.

===Hydrology===
Geology and geological principles can be applied to various environmental problems such as stream restoration, the restoration of brownfields, and the understanding of the interaction between natural habitat and the geological environment. Groundwater hydrology, or hydrogeology, is used to locate groundwater, which can often provide a ready supply of uncontaminated water and is especially important in arid regions, and to monitor the spread of contaminants in groundwater wells.

===Paleoclimatology===
Geologists also obtain data through stratigraphy, boreholes, core samples, and ice cores. Ice cores and sediment cores are used for paleoclimate reconstructions, which tell geologists about past and present temperature, precipitation, and sea level across the globe. These datasets are our primary source of information on global climate change outside of instrumental data.

===Natural hazards===
Geologists and geophysicists study natural hazards in order to enact safe building codes and warning systems that are used to prevent loss of property and life. Examples of important natural hazards that are pertinent to geology (as opposed those that are mainly or only pertinent to meteorology) are:
==History==
The study of the physical material of the Earth dates back at least to ancient Greece when Theophrastus (372–287 BCE) wrote the work &quot;Peri Lithon&quot; (&quot;On Stones&quot;). During the Roman period, Pliny the Elder wrote in detail of the many minerals and metals, then in practical use – even correctly noting the origin of amber. Additionally, in the 4th century BCE Aristotle made critical observations of the slow rate of geological change. He observed the composition of the land and formulated a theory where the Earth changes at a slow rate and that these changes cannot be observed during one person&#x27;s lifetime. Aristotle developed one of the first evidence-based concepts connected to the geological realm regarding the rate at which the Earth physically changes.

Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni (973–1048 CE) was one of the earliest Persian geologists, whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India, hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea. Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981–1037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science. In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by the erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.

Georgius Agricola (1494–1555) published his groundbreaking work &quot;De Natura Fossilium&quot; in 1546 and is seen as the founder of geology as a scientific discipline.

Nicolas Steno (1638–1686) is credited with the law of superposition, the principle of original horizontality, and the principle of lateral continuity: three defining principles of stratigraphy.

The word &quot;geology&quot; was first used by Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1603, then by Jean-André Deluc in 1778 and introduced as a fixed term by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure in 1779. The word is derived from the Greek γῆ, &quot;gê&quot;, meaning &quot;earth&quot; and λόγος, &quot;logos&quot;, meaning &quot;speech&quot;. But according to another source, the word &quot;geology&quot; comes from a Norwegian, Mikkel Pedersøn Escholt (1600–1669), who was a priest and scholar. Escholt first used the definition in his book titled, &quot;Geologia Norvegica&quot; (1657).

William Smith (1769–1839) drew some of the first geological maps and began the process of ordering rock strata (layers) by examining the fossils contained in them.

In 1763, Mikhail Lomonosov published his treatise &quot;On the Strata of Earth&quot;. His work was the first narrative of modern geology, based on the unity of processes in time and explanation of the Earth&#x27;s past from the present.

James Hutton (1726–1797) is often viewed as the first modern geologist. In 1785 he presented a paper entitled &quot;Theory of the Earth&quot; to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In his paper, he explained his theory that the Earth must be much older than had previously been supposed to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for sediments to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land. Hutton published a two-volume version of his ideas in 1795.

Followers of Hutton were known as &quot;Plutonists&quot; because they believed that some rocks were formed by &quot;vulcanism&quot;, which is the deposition of lava from volcanoes, as opposed to the &quot;Neptunists&quot;, led by Abraham Werner, who believed that all rocks had settled out of a large ocean whose level gradually dropped over time.

The first geological map of the U.S. was produced in 1809 by William Maclure. In 1807, Maclure commenced the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States. Almost every state in the Union was traversed and mapped by him, the Allegheny Mountains being crossed and recrossed some 50 times. The results of his unaided labours were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled &quot;Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map&quot;, and published in the &quot;Society&#x27;s Transactions&quot;, together with the nation&#x27;s first geological map. This antedates William Smith&#x27;s geological map of England by six years, although it was constructed using a different classification of rocks.

Sir Charles Lyell (1797–1875) first published his famous book, &quot;Principles of Geology&quot;, in 1830. This book, which influenced the thought of Charles Darwin, successfully promoted the doctrine of uniformitarianism. This theory states that slow geological processes have occurred throughout the Earth&#x27;s history and are still occurring today. In contrast, catastrophism is the theory that Earth&#x27;s features formed in single, catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter. Though Hutton believed in uniformitarianism, the idea was not widely accepted at the time.

Much of 19th-century geology revolved around the question of the Earth&#x27;s exact age. Estimates varied from a few hundred thousand to billions of years. By the early 20th century, radiometric dating allowed the Earth&#x27;s age to be estimated at two billion years. The awareness of this vast amount of time opened the door to new theories about the processes that shaped the planet.

Some of the most significant advances in 20th-century geology have been the development of the theory of plate tectonics in the 1960s and the refinement of estimates of the planet&#x27;s age. Plate tectonics theory arose from two separate geological observations: seafloor spreading and continental drift. The theory revolutionized the Earth sciences. Today the Earth is known to be approximately 4.5 billion years old.

<text>Eugene Curran Kelly (August 23, 1912 – February 2, 1996) was an American dancer, actor, singer, director and choreographer. He was known for his energetic and athletic dancing style and sought to create a new form of American dance accessible to the general public, which he called &quot;dance for the common man&quot;. He starred in, choreographed, and, with Stanley Donen, co-directed some of the most well-regarded musical films of the 1940s and 1950s.

Kelly is known for his performances in &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951), which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), which he and Donen directed and choreographed, and other musical films of that era such as &quot;Cover Girl&quot; (1944) and &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; (1945), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. &quot;On the Town&quot; (1949), which he co-directed with Donen, was his directorial debut. Later in the 1950s, as musicals waned in popularity, he starred in &quot;Brigadoon&quot; (1954) and &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot; (1955), the last film he directed with Donen. His solo directorial debut was &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot; (1956), one of the last MGM musicals, which was a commercial failure.

Kelly made his film debut in &quot;For Me and My Gal&quot; (1942) with Judy Garland, with whom he also appeared in &quot;The Pirate&quot; (1948) and &quot;Summer Stock&quot; (1950). He also appeared in the dramas &quot;Black Hand&quot; (1950) and &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1960), for which he received critical praise.

He continued as a director in the 1960s, with his credits including &quot;A Guide for the Married Man&quot; (1967) and &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (1969), which received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. He co-hosted and appeared in &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; (1946), &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; (1974), &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment, Part II&quot; (1976), &quot;That&#x27;s Dancing!&quot; (1985), and &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment, Part III&quot; (1994).

His innovations transformed the Hollywood musical, and he is credited with almost single-handedly making the ballet form commercially acceptable to film audiences. According to dance and art historian Beth Genné, working with his co-director Donen in &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; and in films with director Vincente Minnelli, &quot;Kelly ... fundamentally affected the way movies are made and the way we look at them. And he did it with a dancer&#x27;s eye and from a dancer&#x27;s perspective.&quot; Kelly received an Academy Honorary Award in 1952 for his career achievements; the same year, &quot;An American in Paris&quot; won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. He later received lifetime achievement awards in the Kennedy Center Honors (1982) and from the Screen Actors Guild and American Film Institute. In 1999, the American Film Institute also ranked him as the 15th greatest male screen legend of Classic Hollywood Cinema.

==Early life==
Kelly was born in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh. He was middle of 5 children of James Patrick Joseph Kelly, a phonograph salesman, and his wife, Harriet Catherine Curran. His father was born in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada, to an Irish Canadian family. His maternal grandfather was an immigrant from Derry, Ireland, and his maternal grandmother was of German ancestry. When he was eight, Kelly&#x27;s mother enrolled him and his brother James in dance classes, along with their sisters. As Kelly recalled, they both rebelled: &quot;We didn&#x27;t like it much and were continually involved in fistfights with the neighborhood boys who called us sissies  ... I didn&#x27;t dance again until I was 15.&quot; At one time, his childhood dream was to play shortstop for the hometown Pittsburgh Pirates.

By the time he decided to dance, he was an accomplished sportsman and able to defend himself. He attended St. Raphael Elementary School in the Morningside neighborhood of Pittsburgh and graduated from Peabody High School at age 16. He entered the Pennsylvania State College as a journalism major, but after the 1929 crash he left school and found work in order to help his family financially. He created dance routines with his younger brother Fred to earn prize money in local talent contests. They also performed in local nightclubs.

In 1931, Kelly enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh to study economics, joining the Theta Kappa Phi fraternity (later known as Phi Kappa Theta after merging with Phi Kappa). He became involved in the university&#x27;s Cap and Gown Club, which staged original musical productions. After graduating in 1933, he continued to be active with the Cap and Gown Club, serving as the director from 1934 to 1938. Kelly was admitted to the University of Pittsburgh Law School.

His family opened a dance studio in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. In 1932, they renamed it the Gene Kelly Studio of the Dance and opened a second location in Johnstown, Pennsylvania in 1933. Kelly served as a teacher at the studio during his undergraduate and law-student years at Pitt. In 1931, he was approached by the Beth Shalom Synagogue in Pittsburgh to teach dance, and to stage the annual Kermesse. The venture proved a success, Kelly being retained for seven years until his departure for New York.

Kelly eventually decided to pursue a career as a dance teacher and full-time entertainer, so he dropped out of law school after two months. He increased his focus on performing and later said: &quot;With time I became disenchanted with teaching because the ratio of girls to boys was more than ten to one, and once the girls reached 16, the dropout rate was very high.&quot; In 1937, having successfully managed and developed the family&#x27;s dance-school business, he moved to New York City in search of work as a choreographer. Kelly returned to Pittsburgh, to his family home at 7514 Kensington Street, in 1940, and worked as a theatrical actor.

==Stage career==
After a fruitless search for work in New York, Kelly returned to Pittsburgh to his first position as a choreographer with the Charles Gaynor musical revue &quot;Hold Your Hats&quot; at the Pittsburgh Playhouse in April 1938. Kelly appeared in six of the sketches, one of which, &quot;La cumparsita&quot;, became the basis of an extended Spanish number in the film &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; eight years later.

His first Broadway assignment, in November 1938, was as a dancer in Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Leave It to Me!&quot;—as the American ambassador&#x27;s secretary who supports Mary Martin while she sings &quot;My Heart Belongs to Daddy&quot;. He had been hired by Robert Alton, who had staged a show at the Pittsburgh Playhouse where he was impressed by Kelly&#x27;s teaching skills. When Alton moved on to choreograph the musical &quot;One for the Money&quot;, he hired Kelly to act, sing, and dance in eight routines. In 1939, he was selected for a musical revue, &quot;One for the Money&quot;, produced by the actress Katharine Cornell, who was known for finding and hiring talented young actors.

Kelly&#x27;s first big breakthrough was in the Pulitzer Prize–winning &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot;, which opened on October 25, 1939—in which, for the first time on Broadway, he danced to his own choreography. In 1939, he received his first assignment as a Broadway choreographer, for &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Diamond Horseshoe&quot;. He began dating a cast member, Betsy Blair, and they got married on October 16, 1941.

In 1940, he got the lead role in Rodgers and Hart&#x27;s &quot;Pal Joey&quot;, again choreographed by Robert Alton. This role propelled him to stardom. During its run, he told reporters: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in conformity to any school of dancing. I create what the drama and the music demand. While I am a hundred percent for ballet technique, I use only what I can adapt to my own use. I never let technique get in the way of mood or continuity.&quot; His colleagues at this time noticed his great commitment to rehearsal and hard work. Van Johnson—who also appeared in &quot;Pal Joey&quot;—recalled: &quot;I watched him rehearsing, and it seemed to me that there was no possible room for improvement. Yet he wasn&#x27;t satisfied. It was midnight and we had been rehearsing since 8 in the morning. I was making my way sleepily down the long flight of stairs when I heard staccato steps coming from the stage ... I could see just a single lamp burning. Under it, a figure was dancing ... Gene.&quot;

Offers from Hollywood began to arrive, but Kelly was in no hurry to leave New York. Eventually, he signed with David O. Selznick, agreeing to go to Hollywood at the end of his commitment to &quot;Pal Joey&quot;, in October 1941. Prior to his contract, he also managed to fit in choreographing the stage production of &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot;.

==Film career==

===1941–1945: Becoming established in Hollywood===
Selznick sold half of Kelly&#x27;s contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for his first motion picture: &quot;For Me and My Gal&quot; (1942) starring Judy Garland. Kelly said he was &quot;appalled at the sight of myself blown up 20 times. I had an awful feeling that I was a tremendous flop.&quot; &quot;For Me and My Gal&quot; performed very well, and in the face of much internal resistance, Arthur Freed of MGM picked up the other half of Kelly&#x27;s contract. After appearing in a B movie drama, &quot;Pilot No. 5&quot; (1943) and in &quot;Christmas Holiday&quot; (1944), he took the male lead in Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Du Barry Was a Lady&quot; (1943) with Lucille Ball, in a part originally intended for Ann Sothern. His first opportunity to dance to his own choreography came in his next picture, &quot;Thousands Cheer&quot; (1943), in which he performed a mock-love dance with a mop. Unusually, in &quot;Pilot No. 5&quot;, Kelly played the antagonist.

In 1944 he achieved a significant breakthrough as a dancer on film when MGM lent him to Columbia to work with Rita Hayworth in &quot;Cover Girl&quot;, a film that foreshadowed the best of his future work. He created a memorable routine dancing to his own reflection. Despite this, critic Manny Farber was moved to praise Kelly&#x27;s &quot;attitude&quot;, &quot;clarity&quot;, and &quot;feeling&quot; as an actor while inauspiciously concluding, &quot;The two things he does least well—singing and dancing—are what he is given most consistently to do.&quot;

In Kelly&#x27;s next film, &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; (1945), MGM gave him a free hand to devise a range of dance routines, including his duets with co-star Frank Sinatra and the celebrated animated dance with Jerry Mouse—the animation for which was supervised by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. That performance was enough for Farber to completely reverse his previous assessment of Kelly&#x27;s skills. Reviewing the film, Farber enthused, &quot;Kelly is the most exciting dancer to appear in Hollywood movies.&quot; &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; became one of the most successful films of 1945 and Kelly was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. In &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; (1946)—which was produced in 1944 but delayed for release—Kelly collaborated with Fred Astaire, for whom he had the greatest admiration, in &quot;The Babbitt and the Bromide&quot; challenge dance routine.

==== Military service ====
Kelly was deferred from the draft in 1940 by the U.S. Selective Service System at the request of his employers, but was classified 1-A, eligible for induction, in October 1944 after an appeal to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt by the head of the Selective Service in New York City. Roosevelt personally upheld the appeal. 

In November 1944, he was inducted into the armed forces, and at his request he was assigned to the U.S. Navy. He served in the U.S. Naval Air Service and was commissioned as lieutenant, junior grade. He was stationed in the Photographic Section, Washington, D.C., where he helped write and direct a range of documentaries – this stimulated his interest in the production side of filmmaking. He was discharged in 1946.

===1946–1952: MGM===
After Kelly returned from Naval service, MGM had nothing planned and used him in a routine black-and-white movie: &quot;Living in a Big Way&quot; (1947). The film was considered so weak that the studio asked Kelly to design and insert a series of dance routines; they noticed his ability to carry out such assignments. This led to a lead part in his next picture, with Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli—a musical film version of S.N. Behrman&#x27;s play, &quot;The Pirate&quot; (1948), with songs by Cole Porter. &quot;The Pirate&quot; gave full rein to Kelly&#x27;s athleticism. It features Kelly&#x27;s work with the Nicholas Brothers—the leading black dancers of their day—in a virtuoso dance routine. Now regarded as a classic, the film was ahead of its time, but flopped at the box office.
MGM wanted Kelly to return to safer and more commercial vehicles, but he ceaselessly fought for an opportunity to direct his own musical film. In the interim, he capitalized on his swashbuckling image as d&#x27;Artagnan in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; in 1948—and appeared with Vera-Ellen in the &quot;Slaughter on Tenth Avenue&quot; ballet in &quot;Words and Music&quot; (1948 again). He was due to play the male lead opposite Garland in &quot;Easter Parade&quot; (1948), but broke his ankle playing volleyball. He withdrew from the film and persuaded Fred Astaire to come out of retirement to replace him. 

In 1949 he starred in &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;, his second film with Sinatra, where Kelly paid tribute to his Irish heritage in &quot;The Hat My Father Wore on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day&quot; routine. This musical film persuaded Arthur Freed to have Kelly make &quot;On the Town&quot;, also in 1949, in which he partnered with Frank Sinatra for the third and final time. A breakthrough in the musical film genre, it has been described as &quot;the most inventive and effervescent musical thus far produced in Hollywood.&quot;

Stanley Donen, brought to Hollywood by Kelly to be his assistant choreographer, received co-director credit for &quot;On the Town&quot;. According to Kelly: &quot;when you are involved in doing choreography for film, you must have expert assistants. I needed one to watch my performance, and one to work with the cameraman on the timing ... without such people as Stanley, Carol Haney, and Jeanne Coyne I could never have done these things. When we came to do &quot;On the Town&quot;, I knew it was time for Stanley to get screen credit because we weren&#x27;t boss–assistant anymore but co-creators.&quot; Together, they opened up the musical form, taking the film musical out of the studio and into real locations, with Donen taking responsibility for the staging and Kelly handling the choreography. Kelly went much further than before in introducing modern ballet into his dance sequences, going so far in the &quot;Day in New York&quot; routine as to substitute four leading ballet specialists for Sinatra, Munshin, Garrett, and Miller.

Kelly asked the studio for a straight acting role, and he took the lead role in the early Mafia melodrama &quot;Black Hand&quot; (1950). This exposé of organized crime is set in New York&#x27;s &quot;Little Italy&quot; during the late 19th century and focuses on the Black Hand, a group that extorts money upon threat of death. In the real-life incidents upon which this film is based, it was the Mafia, not the Black Hand, who functioned as the villain. Filmmakers had to tread gingerly whenever dealing with big-time crime, it being safer to go after a &quot;dead&quot; criminal organization than a &quot;live&quot; one. There followed &quot;Summer Stock&quot; (1950)—Garland&#x27;s last musical film for MGM—in which Kelly performed the &quot;You, You Wonderful You&quot; solo routine with a newspaper and a squeaky floorboard. In his book &quot;Easy the Hard Way&quot;, Joe Pasternak, head of another of MGM&#x27;s musical units, singled out Kelly for his patience and willingness to spend as much time as necessary to enable the ailing Garland to complete her part.

Then followed in quick succession two musicals that secured Kelly&#x27;s reputation as a major figure in the American musical film. First, &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951) and—probably the most admired of all film musicals—&quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952). As co-director, lead star, and choreographer, Kelly was the driving force in both of these films. Johnny Green, the head of music at MGM at the time, said of him,

Gene is easygoing as long as you know exactly what you are doing when you&#x27;re working with him. He&#x27;s a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you&#x27;d better like hard work, too. He isn&#x27;t cruel, but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something, he didn&#x27;t care who he was talking to, whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn&#x27;t awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.

&quot;An American in Paris&quot; won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The film also marked the debut of 19-year-old ballerina Leslie Caron, whom Kelly had spotted in Paris and brought to Hollywood. Its dream ballet sequence, lasting an unprecedented 17 minutes, was the most expensive production number ever filmed at that time. Bosley Crowther described it as, &quot;whoop-de-doo ... one of the finest ever put on the screen.&quot; Also in 1951, Kelly received an honorary Academy Award for his contribution to film musicals and the art of choreography.
The following year, &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; featured Kelly&#x27;s celebrated and much imitated solo dance routine to the title song, along with the &quot;Moses Supposes&quot; routine with Donald O&#x27;Connor and the &quot;Broadway Melody&quot; finale with Cyd Charisse. Though the film did not initially generate the same enthusiasm &quot;An American in Paris&quot; created, it has subsequently overtaken the earlier film to occupy its current pre-eminent place in the esteem of critics.

===1953–1957: Decline of Hollywood musicals===
At the peak of his creative powers, Kelly made what in retrospect some see as a career mistake. In December 1951, he signed a contract with MGM that sent him to Europe for 19 months to use MGM funds frozen in Europe to make three pictures while personally benefiting from tax exemptions. &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot;, a pet project of Kelly&#x27;s to bring modern ballet to mainstream film audiences. It was beset with delays and technical problems, and flopped when finally released in 1956.

When Kelly returned to Hollywood in 1953, the film musical was beginning to feel the pressures from television, and MGM cut the budget for his next picture &quot;Brigadoon&quot; (1954), with Cyd Charisse, forcing him to make the film on studio backlots instead of on location in Scotland. This year also had him appear as a guest star with his brother Fred in the &quot;I Love to Go Swimmin&#x27; with Wimmen&quot; routine in &quot;Deep in My Heart&quot; (1954). 

MGM&#x27;s refusal to lend him out for &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; and &quot;Pal Joey&quot; put further strains on his relationship with the studio. He negotiated an exit to his contract that involved making three further pictures for MGM. The first of these, &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot; (1955), co-directed with Donen, was a musical satire on television and advertising, and includes his roller-skate dance routine to &quot;I Like Myself&quot;, and a dance trio with Michael Kidd and Dan Dailey that Kelly used to experiment with the widescreen possibilities of Cinemascope. 

MGM had lost faith in Kelly&#x27;s box-office appeal, and as a result &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot; premiered at 17 drive-in theaters around the Los Angeles metroplex. Next followed Kelly&#x27;s last musical film for MGM, &quot;Les Girls&quot; (1957), in which he joined Mitzi Gaynor, Kay Kendall, and Taina Elg. The third picture he completed was a co-production between MGM and himself, a B-film, &quot;The Happy Road&quot; (1957), set in his beloved France, his first foray in a new role as producer-director-actor. After leaving MGM, Kelly returned to stage work.

===1958–1996: After MGM===
In 1958, Kelly directed Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s musical play &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;. Early in 1960, Kelly, an ardent Francophile and fluent French speaker, was invited by A. M. Julien, the general administrator of the Paris Opéra and Opéra-Comique, to select his own material and create a modern ballet for the company, the first time an American had received such an assignment. The result was &quot;Pas de Dieux&quot;, based on Greek mythology, combined with the music of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Concerto in F&quot;. It was a major success, and it led to his being honored with the &quot;Chevalier&quot; de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur by the French Government.

In 1960, Kelly continued to make some film appearances, such as Hornbeck in the Hollywood production of &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; and as himself in &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Love&quot;. However, most of his efforts were now concentrated on film production and directing. In Paris, he directed Jackie Gleason in &quot;Gigot&quot; (1962), but the film was drastically recut by Seven Arts Productions and flopped. Another French effort, Jacques Demy&#x27;s homage to the MGM musical, &quot;The Young Girls of Rochefort&quot; (&quot;Les Demoiselles de Rochefort&quot;, 1967), in which Kelly appeared, was a box-office success in France and nominated for Academy Awards for Best Music and Score of a Musical Picture (Original or Adaptation), but performed poorly elsewhere.

He was asked to direct the 1965 film version of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, which had already been turned down by Stanley Donen. He escorted Ernest Lehman, the screenwriter, out of his house, saying, &quot;Go find someone else to direct this piece of shit.&quot;

His first foray into television was a documentary for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Omnibus&quot;, &quot;Dancing is a Man&#x27;s Game&quot; (1958), in which he assembled a group of America&#x27;s greatest sportsmen—including Mickey Mantle, Sugar Ray Robinson, and Bob Cousy—and reinterpreted their moves choreographically, as part of his lifelong quest to remove the effeminate stereotype of the art of dance, while articulating the philosophy behind his dance style. It gained an Emmy nomination for choreography and now stands as the key document explaining Kelly&#x27;s approach to modern dance.

Kelly appeared frequently on television shows during the 1960s, including &quot;Going My Way&quot; (1962–63), which was based on the 1944 film of the same name. It enjoyed great popularity in Roman Catholic countries outside the US. He also appeared in three major TV specials: &quot;The Julie Andrews Show&quot; (1965), &quot;New York, New York&quot; (1966), and &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; (1967)—a show he produced and directed that again combined cartoon animation and live dance, winning him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program.
In 1963, Kelly joined Universal Pictures for a two-year stint. He joined 20th Century Fox in 1965, but had little to do—partly due to his decision to decline assignments away from Los Angeles for family reasons. His perseverance finally paid off, with the major box-office hit &quot;A Guide for the Married Man&quot; (1967), in which he directed Walter Matthau. Then, a major opportunity arose when Fox—buoyed by the returns from &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965)—commissioned Kelly to direct &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (1969), again directing Matthau along with Barbra Streisand. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning three.

In 1966, Kelly starred in a musical television special for CBS titled &quot;Gene Kelly in New York, New York&quot;. The special focuses on Gene Kelly in a musical tour around Manhattan, dancing along such landmarks as Rockefeller Center, the Plaza Hotel, and the Museum of Modern Art, which serve as backdrops for the show&#x27;s entertaining production numbers. The special was written by Woody Allen, who also stars alongside Kelly. Guest stars included choreographer Gower Champion, British musical comedy star Tommy Steele, and singer Damita Jo DeBlanc.

In 1970, he made another television special: &quot;Gene Kelly and 50 Girls&quot;, and was invited to bring the show to Las Vegas, which he did for an eight-week stint on the condition he be paid more than any artist had ever been paid there. He directed veteran actors James Stewart and Henry Fonda in the comedy Western &quot;The Cheyenne Social Club&quot; (1970), which performed poorly at the box office. In 1973, he worked again with Frank Sinatra as part of Sinatra&#x27;s Emmy-nominated TV special, &quot;Magnavox Presents Frank Sinatra&quot;. 

In 1974, he appeared as one of many special narrators in the surprise hit &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot;. In 1976, he directed and co-starred with his friend Fred Astaire in the sequel &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment, Part II&quot;. It was a measure of his powers of persuasion that he managed to coax the 77-year-old Astaire—who had insisted that his contract rule out any dancing, having long since retired—into performing a series of song-and-dance duets, evoking a powerful nostalgia for the glory days of the American musical film.

Kelly was a guest on the 1975 television special starring Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gormé, &quot;Our Love Is Here to Stay,&quot; appearing with his son, Tim, and daughter, Bridget. He starred in the poorly received action film &quot;Viva Knievel!&quot; (1977), with the then high-profile stuntman, Evel Knievel. Kelly continued to make frequent TV appearances. His final film role was in &quot;Xanadu&quot; (1980), a flop despite a popular soundtrack that spawned five Top 20 hits by the Electric Light Orchestra, Cliff Richard, and Kelly&#x27;s co-star Olivia Newton-John. In Kelly&#x27;s opinion, &quot;The concept was marvelous, but it just didn&#x27;t come off.&quot; 

In 1980, he was invited by Francis Ford Coppola to recruit a production staff for American Zoetrope&#x27;s &quot;One from the Heart&quot; (1982). Although Coppola&#x27;s ambition was for him to establish a production unit to rival the Freed Unit at MGM, the film&#x27;s failure put an end to this idea. In November 1983 he made his first Royal Variety Performance before Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, at London&#x27;s Theatre Royal. Kelly served as executive producer and co-host of &quot;That&#x27;s Dancing!&quot; (1985), a celebration of the history of dance in the American musical. Kelly&#x27;s final on-screen appearance was to introduce &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; (1994). His final film project was the animated film &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot;, not released until 1997, for which Kelly acted as an uncredited choreographic consultant. It was dedicated to his memory.

In 1993, Kelly was hired by Madonna and her brother Christopher Ciccone to do the choreography for part of Madonna&#x27;s The Girlie Show tour, but he was quickly dismissed due to the very different visions that Kelly and the Ciccones had about the performers he was to direct and their dancing abilities.

==Working methods and influence on filmed dance==
When he began his collaborative film work, he was influenced by Robert Alton and John Murray Anderson, striving to create moods and character insight with his dances. He choreographed his own movement, along with that of the ensemble, with the assistance of Jeanne Coyne, Stanley Donen, Carol Haney, and Alex Romero. He experimented with lighting, camera techniques, and special effects to achieve true integration of dance with film, and was one of the first to use split screens, double images, and live action with animation, and is credited as the person who made the ballet form commercially acceptable to film audiences.

A clear progression was evident in his development, from an early concentration on tap and musical comedy style to greater complexity using ballet and modern dance forms. Kelly himself refused to categorize his style: &quot;I don&#x27;t have a name for my style of dancing ... It&#x27;s certainly hybrid ... I&#x27;ve borrowed from the modern dance, from the classical, and certainly from the American folk dance—tap-dancing, jitterbugging ... But I have tried to develop a style which is indigenous to the environment in which I was reared.&quot; He especially acknowledged the influence of George M. Cohan: &quot;I have a lot of Cohan in me. It&#x27;s an Irish quality, a jaw-jutting, up-on-the-toes cockiness—which is a good quality for a male dancer to have.&quot; 

He was heavily influenced by an African-American dancer, Robert Dotson, whom he saw perform at Loew&#x27;s Penn Theatre around 1929. He was briefly taught by Frank Harrington, an African-American tap specialist from New York. However, his main interest was in ballet, which he studied under Kotchetovsky in the early 1930s. Biographer Clive Hirschhorn writes: &quot;As a child, he used to run for miles through parks and streets and woods—anywhere, just as long as he could feel the wind against his body and through his hair. Ballet gave him the same feeling of exhilaration, and in 1933, he was convinced it was the most satisfying form of self-expression.&quot; 

He studied Spanish dancing under Angel Cansino, Rita Hayworth&#x27;s uncle. Generally speaking, he tended to use tap and other popular dance idioms to express joy and exuberance—as in the title song for &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; or &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot; in &quot;An American in Paris&quot;, whereas pensive or romantic feelings were more often expressed via ballet or modern dance, as in &quot;Heather on the Hill&quot; from &quot;Brigadoon&quot; or &quot;Our Love Is Here to Stay&quot; from &quot;An American in Paris&quot;.
According to Delamater, Kelly&#x27;s work &quot;seems to represent the fulfillment of dance–film integration in the 1940s and 1950s&quot;. While Fred Astaire had revolutionized the filming of dance in the 1930s by insisting on full-figure photography of dancers, while allowing only a modest degree of camera movement, Kelly freed up the camera, making greater use of space, camera movement, camera angles, and editing, creating a partnership between dance movement and camera movement without sacrificing full-figure framing. 

Kelly&#x27;s reasoning behind this was that he felt the kinetic force of live dance often evaporated when brought to film, and he sought to partially overcome this by involving the camera in movement and giving the dancer a greater number of directions in which to move. Examples of this abound in Kelly&#x27;s work and are well illustrated in the &quot;Prehistoric Man&quot; sequence from &quot;On the Town&quot; and &quot;The Hat My Father Wore on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day&quot; from &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;. 

In 1951, he summed up his vision as: &quot;If the camera is to make a contribution at all to dance, this must be the focal point of its contribution; the fluid background, giving each spectator an undistorted and altogether similar view of dancer and background. To accomplish this, the camera is made fluid, moving with the dancer, so that the lens becomes the eye of the spectator, &quot;your eye&quot;&quot;.

Kelly&#x27;s athleticism gave his moves a distinctive broad, muscular quality, and this was a deliberate choice on his part, as he explained: &quot;There&#x27;s a strong link between sports and dancing, and my own dancing springs from my early days as an athlete ... I think dancing is a man&#x27;s game and if he does it well he does it better than a woman.&quot; Caron said that while dancing with Astaire she felt like she was floating, Kelly danced close to the ground. He railed against what he saw as the widespread effeminacy in male dancing, which, in his opinion, &quot;tragically&quot; stigmatized the genre, alienating boys from entering the field: Dancing &quot;does&quot; attract effeminate young men. I don&#x27;t object to that as long as they don&#x27;t dance effeminately. I just say that if a man dances effeminately, he dances badly—just as if a woman comes out on stage and starts to sing bass. Unfortunately, people confuse gracefulness with softness. John Wayne is a graceful man and so are some of the great ballplayers ... but, of course, they don&#x27;t run the risk of being called sissies. In his view, &quot;one of our problems is that so much dancing is taught by women. You can spot many male dancers who have this tuition by their arm movements—they are soft, limp, and feminine.&quot; He acknowledged that in spite of his efforts—in TV programs such as &quot;Dancing: A Man&#x27;s Game&quot; (1958) for example—the situation changed little over the years.

He also sought to break from the class-conscious conventions of the 1930s and early 40s, when top hat and tails or tuxedos were the norm, by dancing in casual or everyday work clothes, so as to make his dancing more relevant to the cinema-going public. His first wife, actress and dancer Betsy Blair said: A sailor suit or his white socks and loafers, or the T-shirts on his muscular torso, gave everyone the feeling that he was a regular guy, and perhaps they, too, could express love and joy by dancing in the street or stomping through puddles ... he democratized the dance in movies. In particular, he wanted to create a completely different image from that associated with Fred Astaire, not least because he believed his physique did not suit such refined elegance: &quot;I used to envy his cool, aristocratic style, so intimate and contained. Fred wears top hat and tails to the Manor born—I put them on and look like a truck driver.&quot;

==Personal life==
From the mid-1940s through the early 1950s, his wife Betsy Blair and he organized weekly parties at their Beverly Hills home, and they often played an intensely competitive and physical version of charades, known as &quot;The Game&quot;.

His papers are housed at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University.

Late in life, Kelly was awarded Irish citizenship under Ireland&#x27;s Citizenship by Foreign Birth program. The application was initiated on his behalf by his wife Patricia Ward Kelly.

On December 22, 1983, the actor&#x27;s Beverly Hills mansion burned down. Faulty Christmas tree wiring was blamed. His family and pets escaped and he suffered a burned hand.

===Marriages===

Kelly married three times. His first marriage was to actress Betsy Blair in 1941. They had one child, Kerry (b. 1942), and they divorced in April 1957.

In 1960, Kelly married his choreographic assistant Jeanne Coyne. She had previously been married to Stanley Donen between 1948 and 1951. Kelly and Coyne had two children, Timothy (b. 1962) and Bridget (b. 1964). This marriage lasted until Coyne died in 1973.

Kelly married Patricia Ward in 1990, when he was 77 and she was 30. Their marriage lasted until his death in 1996, and she has never remarried.

===Political and religious views===
Kelly was a lifelong supporter of the Democratic Party. His period of greatest prominence coincided with the McCarthy era in the US. In 1947, he was part of the Committee for the First Amendment, the Hollywood delegation that flew to Washington to protest against the first official hearings which were held by the House Committee on Un-American Activities. His first wife, Betsy Blair, was suspected of being a communist sympathizer, and when United Artists, which had offered Blair a part in &quot;Marty&quot; (1955), were considering withdrawing her under pressure from the American Legion, Kelly successfully threatened MGM&#x27;s influence on United Artists with a pullout from &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot; unless his wife was restored to the part. He used his position on the board of directors of the Writers Guild of America West on a number of occasions to mediate disputes between unions and the Hollywood studios.

He was raised as a Roman Catholic and he was a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California. After he became disenchanted with the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s support for Francisco Franco&#x27;s opposition to the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War, he officially severed his ties with the church in September 1939. This separation was prompted, in part, by a trip which Kelly took to Mexico in which he became convinced that the church had failed to help the poor in Mexico. After his departure from the Catholic Church, Kelly became an agnostic, as he had previously described himself.

==Illness and death==
Kelly&#x27;s health steadily declined in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In July 1994, he suffered a stroke and stayed in the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center hospital for seven weeks. In early 1995, he suffered another stroke which left him severely disabled. Kelly died on February 2, 1996.

<text>Gangsta rap or gangster rap, initially called reality rap, is a subgenre of rap music that conveys the culture and values typical of urban gangs, reality of the world and street hustlers. Emerging in the late 1980s, gangsta rap&#x27;s pioneers include Schoolly D of Philadelphia and Ice-T of Los Angeles, later expanding in California with artists such as N.W.A and Tupac Shakur. In 1992, via record producer and rapper Dr. Dre, rapper Snoop Dogg, and their G-funk sound, gangster rap broadened to mainstream popularity.

Gangsta rap has been recurrently accused of promoting disorderly conduct and broad criminality, especially assault, homicide, and drug dealing, as well as misogyny, promiscuity, and materialism. Gangsta rap&#x27;s defenders have variously characterized it as artistic depictions but not literal endorsements of real life in American ghettos, or suggested that some lyrics voice rage against social oppression or police brutality, and have often accused critics of hypocrisy and racial bias. Still, gangsta rap has been assailed even by some black public figures, including Spike Lee, pastor Calvin Butts and activist C. Delores Tucker.

==1985–1988: Early years==

===Schoolly D and Ice-T===
Philadelphia rapper Schoolly D is generally considered the first &quot;gangsta rapper&quot;, significantly influencing the more popular early gangsta rap originator, Ice-T. Ice-T was born in Newark, New Jersey in 1958. As a teenager, he moved to Los Angeles where he rose to prominence in the West Coast hip hop scene. An early case of using &quot;gangsta&quot; as an adjective and a compliment came in his 1984 single &quot;Body Rock&quot;. In 1986, Ice-T released &quot;6 in the Mornin&#x27;&quot;, which is regarded as the second gangsta rap song. Ice-T had been MCing since the early 1980s, but first turned to gangsta rap themes after being influenced by Schoolly D&#x27;s self-titled debut album, and especially the song &quot;P.S.K. What Does It Mean?&quot; (1985), which is regarded as the first gangsta rap song. Schoolly D had &quot;Am I Black Enough For You&quot; album in 1989. In an interview with &quot;PROPS&quot; magazine, Ice-T said:

:Here&#x27;s the exact chronological order of what really went down: The first record that came out along those lines was Schoolly D&#x27;s &quot;P.S.K.&quot; Then the syncopation of that rap was used by me when I made &quot;6 in the Mornin&#x27;&quot;. The vocal delivery was the same: &#x27; ... P.S.K. is makin&#x27; that green&#x27;, &#x27; ... six in the morning, police at my door&#x27;. When I heard that record I was like &quot;Oh shit!&quot; and call it a bite or what you will but I dug that record. My record didn&#x27;t sound like P.S.K., but I liked the way he was flowing with it. P.S.K. was talking about Park Side Killers but it was very vague. That was the only difference, when Schoolly did it, it was &quot;... one by one, I&#x27;m knockin&#x27; em out.&quot; All he did was represent a gang on his record. I took that and wrote a record about guns, beating people down and all that with &quot;6 in the Mornin&#x27;&quot;. At the same time my single came out, Boogie Down Productions hit with &quot;Criminal Minded&quot;, which was a gangster-based album. It wasn&#x27;t about messages or &quot;You Must Learn&quot;, it was about gangsterism.

In 2011, Ice-T repeated in his autobiography that Schoolly D was his inspiration for gangsta rap. Ice-T continued to release gangsta albums for the remainder of the 1980s: &quot;Rhyme Pays&quot; in 1987, &quot;Power&quot; in 1988 and &quot;The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say&quot; in 1989. Ice-T&#x27;s lyrics also contained strong political commentary, and often played the line between glorifying the gangsta lifestyle and criticizing it as a no-win situation.

Schoolly D&#x27;s works would heavily influence not only Ice-T, but also Eazy-E and N.W.A (most notably in the song &quot;Boyz-n-the-Hood&quot;), as well as the Beastie Boys on their seminal hardcore hip hop-inspired album &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; (1986).

===Boogie Down Productions===
Boogie Down Productions released their first single, &quot;Say No Brother (Crack Attack Don&#x27;t Do It)&quot;, in 1986. It was followed by &quot;South Bronx/P is Free&quot; and &quot;9mm Goes Bang&quot; in the same year. The latter is the most gangsta-themed song of the three; in it, KRS-One boasts about shooting a crack dealer and his posse to death (in self-defense). The album &quot;Criminal Minded&quot; followed in 1987, and was the first rap album to have firearms on its cover. Shortly after the release of this album, BDP&#x27;s DJ, Scott LaRock was shot and killed. After this, BDP&#x27;s subsequent records were more focused with the inadequate rationale removed.

===Other early influences===
The New York–based Run-DMC and LL Cool J, though originating prior to the establishment of &quot;gangsta rap&quot; as a cohesive genre, were influential in the formation of gangsta rap, often producing early aggressive hardcore hip hop songs and being among the first rappers to dress in gang-like street clothing. The seminal Long Island–based group Public Enemy featured aggressive, politically charged lyrics, which had an especially strong influence on gangsta rappers such as Ice Cube. The duo Eric B. &amp; Rakim would further influence gangsta rap with aggressive, street-oriented raps, especially on the 1987 album &quot;Paid in Full&quot;.

The hip hop group Beastie Boys also influenced the gangsta rap genre with their 1986 album &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot;, with an early reference to being a &quot;gangster&quot; mentioned in the song &quot;Slow Ride&quot;. In 1986, the Los Angeles–based group C.I.A. (consisting of Ice Cube, K-Dee, Sir Jinx) rapped over the Beastie Boys&#x27; tracks for songs such as &quot;My Posse&quot; and &quot;Ill-Legal&quot;, and the Beastie Boys&#x27; influence can be seen significantly in N.W.A&#x27;s early albums. The Beastie Boys had started out as a hardcore punk band, but after introduction to producer Rick Rubin and the exit of Kate Schellenbach they became a hip hop group. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Magazine, the Beastie Boys&#x27; 1986 album &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; is &quot;filled with enough references to guns, drugs and empty sex (including the pornographic deployment of a Wiffleball bat in &quot;Paul Revere&quot;) to qualify as a gangsta-rap cornerstone.&quot;

==1989–1997: Golden age==

===N.W.A. and Ice Cube===
The first blockbuster gangsta rap album was N.W.A&#x27;s &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; (1989). It established West Coast hip hop as a vital genre and Los Angeles as a legitimate rival to hip hop&#x27;s long-time capital, New York City. &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; sparked the first major controversy regarding hip hop lyrics when their song &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot; earned a letter from FBI Assistant Director, Milt Ahlerich, strongly expressing law enforcement&#x27;s resentment of the song. Due to the influence of Ice-T, N.W.A, and Ice Cube&#x27;s early solo career, gangsta rap is often somewhat erroneously credited as being a mostly West Coast phenomenon, despite the contributions of East Coast acts like Boogie Down Productions in shaping the genre and despite Philadelphia rapper Schoolly D being generally regarded as the first gangsta rapper.

In the early 1990s, former N.W.A member Ice Cube would further influence gangsta rap with his hardcore, socio-political solo albums, which suggested the potential of gangsta rap as a political medium to give voice to inner-city youth. Ice Cube&#x27;s early solo albums and EPs, including &quot;AmeriKKKa&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; (1990), &quot;Death Certificate&quot; (1991), the &quot;Kill at Will&quot; EP (1991) and &quot;The Predator&quot; (1992) all contributed significantly to the development of gangsta rap. N.W.A&#x27;s second album, &quot;Efil4zaggin&quot; (1991) (released after Ice Cube&#x27;s departure from the group), broke ground as the first gangsta rap album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard pop charts.

Aside from N.W.A and Ice-T, Too Short (from Oakland), Kid Frost and the South Gate–based Latino group Cypress Hill were pioneering West Coast rappers with gangsta rap songs and themes. Above the Law also played an important role in the gangsta rap movement, as their 1990 debut album &quot;Livin&#x27; Like Hustlers&quot;.

===Ice-T&#x27;s solo career===
Ice-T released one of the seminal albums of the genre, &quot;&quot; in 1991. It also contained a song by his new thrash metal group Body Count, who released a self-titled album in 1992. Particular controversy surrounded one of its songs &quot;Cop Killer&quot;. The rock song was intended to speak from the viewpoint of a police target seeking revenge on racist, brutal cops. Ice-T&#x27;s rock song gained controversy, with observers ranging from President George H.W Bush and his Vice President Dan Quayle, the National Rifle Association of America, police organizations across the nation to various police advocacy groups. Consequently, Time Warner Music refused to release Ice-T&#x27;s upcoming album &quot;Home Invasion&quot; and dropped Ice-T from the label. Ice-T suggested that the furor over the song was an overreaction, telling journalist Chuck Philips &quot;... they&#x27;ve done movies about nurse killers and teacher killers and student killers. Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator. But I don&#x27;t hear anybody complaining about that.&quot; In the same interview, Ice-T suggested to Philips that the misunderstanding of &quot;Cop Killer&quot;, the misclassification of it as a rap song (rather than a rock song), and the attempts to censor it had racial overtones: &quot;The Supreme Court says it&#x27;s OK for a white man to burn a cross in public. But nobody wants a black man to write a record about a cop killer.&quot;

Ice-T&#x27;s next album, &quot;Home Invasion&quot;, was postponed as a result of the controversy, and was finally released in 1993. While it contained gangsta elements, it was his most political album to date. After a proposed censoring of the &quot;Home Invasion&quot; album cover art, he left Warner Bros. Records. Ice-T&#x27;s subsequent releases went back to straightforward gangsta rap, but were not as popular as his earlier releases.

===G-funk and Death Row Records===
In 1992, former N.W.A member Dr. Dre released &quot;The Chronic&quot; (1992) include &quot;Nuthin&#x27; but a &#x27;G&#x27; Thang&quot;, a massive seller (eventually going triple platinum) which showed that explicit gangsta rap could hold as much mass commercial appeal as the pop-oriented rap styles of MC Hammer, the Fresh Prince and Tone Lōc. The album established the dominance of West Coast gangsta rap and Dre&#x27;s new post-N.W.A label, Death Row Records (owned by Dr. Dre along with Marion &quot;Suge&quot; Knight), as Dre&#x27;s album showcased a stable of promising new Death Row rappers. The album also popularized the subgenre of G-funk, a slow, drawled form of hip hop that dominated the rap charts for some time.

Extensively sampling P-Funk bands, especially Parliament and Funkadelic, G-funk was multi-layered, yet simple and easy to dance to. The simple message of its lyrics, that life&#x27;s problems could be overcome by guns, alcohol and marijuana, endeared it to a teenage audience. The single &quot;Nuthin&#x27; but a &#x27;G&#x27; Thang&quot; became a crossover big hit, with its humorous, &quot;House Party&quot;-influenced video becoming an MTV staple despite that network&#x27;s historic orientation towards rock music.

Another success was Ice Cube&#x27;s &quot;Predator&quot; album, released at about the same time as &quot;The Chronic&quot; in 1992. It sold over 2 million copies and was No. 1 in the charts, propelled by the hit single &quot;It Was a Good Day&quot;, despite the fact that Ice Cube was not a Death Row artist. One of the genre&#x27;s biggest crossover stars was Dre&#x27;s protégé Snoop Doggy Dogg (&quot;Doggystyle&quot;), whose exuberant, party-oriented themes made songs such as &quot;Gin and Juice&quot; club anthems and top hits nationwide. In 1996, 2Pac signed with Death Row and released the multi-platinum double album &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;. Not long afterward, his murder brought gangsta rap into the national headlines and propelled his posthumous &quot;The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory&quot; album (released under the alias &quot;Makaveli&quot;) to the top of the charts. Lill 1/2 Dead released gangsta album. Warren G and Nate Dogg were other musicians at the forefront of G-funk. Successful G-funk influenced artists also included Spice 1, MC Lyte and MC Ren, all of them reaching decent positions on the Billboard 100, or soul chart in spite of not being associated with Death Row. Ray Luv released G single &quot;Last Nite&quot; in 1995.

===Mafioso rap===
Mafioso rap is a hardcore hip hop subgenre founded by Kool G Rap in the late 1980s. East Coast mafioso rap was partially the counterpart of West Coast gangsta rap and G-funk. Mafioso rap is characterized by references to famous mobsters and mafiosi, racketeering and organized crime (particularly the Sicilian Mafia, the Italian-American Mafia, African-American organized crime, and Latin American organized crime or drug cartels) or has subject matter that would relate to the mafia. Though a significant amount of mafioso rap was grittier and more street-oriented, focusing on street-level organized crime, other mafioso rap artists frequently focused on lavish, self-indulgent, materialistic, and luxurious subject matter associated with crime bosses and high-level mobsters, such as expensive drugs, cars, champagne, and semi-legitimate businesses. Though the genre died down for several years, it re-emerged in 1995 when Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon released his critically acclaimed solo album, &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&quot; That year also saw the release of &quot;Doe or Die&quot; by AZ and the release of the album &quot;4,5,6&quot; by subgenre originator Kool G Rap. His album featured other mafioso rap artists, including MF Grimm, Nas, and B-1. These three albums brought the genre to mainstream recognition, and inspired other East Coast rappers, such as Jay-Z, Notorious B.I.G., Nas, and Diddy to adopt the same themes with their albums &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;, &quot;Life After Death,&quot; &quot;It Was Written,&quot; and &quot;No Way Out&quot;, respectively.

East Coast gangsta rap was popular by the late 1990s, and there were more modern mafioso rap albums such as Ghostface Killah&#x27;s &quot;Fishscale&quot;, Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;American Gangster,&quot; Raekwon&#x27;s &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II,&quot; and Rick Ross&#x27;s &quot;Deeper Than Rap&quot;. Many rappers, such as T.I., Fabolous, Jadakiss, Jim Jones, and Cassidy have maintained popularity with lyrics about African-American organized crime or &quot;hustling&quot;. Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s mafioso album &quot;La Bella Mafia&quot;, released in 2003, was a commercial success, receiving platinum certification.

===East Coast hardcore hip hop and the East Coast–West Coast feud===
Meanwhile, rappers from New York City, such as Wu-Tang Clan, Black Moon and Boot Camp Clik, Onyx, Big L, Mobb Deep, Nas, the Notorious B.I.G., DMX and the Lox, among others, pioneered a grittier sound known as hardcore hip hop. In 1994, both Nas and the Notorious B.I.G. released their debut albums &quot;Illmatic&quot; (April 19) and &quot;Ready to Die&quot; (September 13) respectively, which paved the way for New York City to take back dominance from the West Coast. In an interview for &quot;The Independent&quot; in 1994, the Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s GZA commented on the term &quot;gangsta rap&quot; and its association with his group&#x27;s music and hip hop at the time:

It is widely speculated that the ensuing East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry between Death Row Records and Bad Boy Records resulted in the deaths of Death Row Records&#x27; 2Pac and Bad Boy Records&#x27; the Notorious B.I.G.. Even before the murders, Death Row had begun to unravel, as co-founder Dr. Dre had left earlier in 1996; in the aftermath of 2Pac&#x27;s death, label owner Suge Knight was sentenced to prison for a parole violation, and Death Row proceeded to sink quickly as most of its remaining artists, including Snoop Dogg, left. Dr. Dre, at the MTV Video Music Awards, claimed that &quot;gangsta rap was dead&quot;. While Puff Daddy&#x27;s Bad Boy Entertainment fared better than its West Coast rival, it eventually began to lose popularity and support by the end of the decade, due to its pursuit of a more mainstream sound, as well as challenges from Atlanta and New Orleans–based labels, especially, Master P&#x27;s No Limit stable of popular rappers.

===Southern and Midwestern gangsta rap===
Houston first came on to the national scene in the late 1980s with the violent and disturbing stories told by the Geto Boys(hit single &quot;Mind Playing Tricks On Me&quot;), with member Scarface achieving major solo success in the mid-1990s. After the deaths of Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. and the media attention surrounding them, gangsta rap became an even greater commercial force. However, most of the industry&#x27;s major labels were in turmoil, bankrupt, or creatively stagnant, and new labels representing the rap scenes in new locations sprang up.

Master P&#x27;s No Limit Records label, based out of New Orleans, became quite popular in the late 1990s, though critical success was very scarce, with the exceptions of some later additions like Mystikal (&quot;Ghetto Fabulous&quot;, 1998). No Limit had begun its rise to national popularity with Master P&#x27;s &quot;The Ghetto Is Trying to Kill Me!&quot; (1994), and had major hits with Silkk the Shocker (&quot;Charge It 2 Da Game&quot;, 1998) and C-Murder (&quot;Life or Death&quot;, 1998). No Limit released Mia X, Mr. Serv-On and TRU albums also. Cash Money Records, also based out of New Orleans, had enormous commercial success with Juvenile, B.G., Hot Boys, beginning in the late 1990s with a similar gangsta rap style like No Limit.

Memphis collective Hypnotize Minds, led by Three 6 Mafia and Project Pat, have taken gangsta rap to some of its darker extremes. Led by in-house producers DJ Paul and Juicy J, the label became known for its pulsating, menacing beats and uncompromisingly thuggish lyrics. However, in the mid-2000s, the group began attaining more mainstream popularity, eventually culminating in the Three 6 Mafia winning an Academy Award for the song &quot;It&#x27;s Hard out Here for a Pimp&quot; from &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot;.

The chopped and screwed genre was developed in Houston, Texas, the location which is still most associated with the style. DJ Screw is credited with the creation of and early experimentation with the genre. DJ Screw began making mixtapes of the slowed-down music in the early 1990s and began the Screwed Up Click. This provided a significant outlet for MCs in the South-Houston area, and helped local rappers such as Willie D, Big Moe, Lil&#x27; Flip, E.S.G., UGK, Lil&#x27; Keke, South Park Mexican, and Z-Ro gain regional and sometimes national prominence.

===Narco-rap===
Narco-rap is a music scene, similar to the early underground gangsta rap scene, that emerged in north-eastern Mexico and southern Texas. Its lyrical content, popular among Latino youth, is violent and focuses on the power of drug cartels and the gruesomeness of the Mexican drug war. Narco-rap emerged in the urban areas of Tamaulipas, a Mexican state currently subject to a turf war between Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel. Narco-rappers sing about the life of mobsters and the reality of the cities under the cartel&#x27;s rule. Some of the key players of the genre are Cano y Blunt, DemenT and Big Los.

==1997–2007: Bling era/crunk==
Before the late 1990s, gangsta rap, while a huge-selling genre, had been regarded as well outside of the pop mainstream, committed to representing the experience of the inner-city and not &quot;selling out&quot; to the pop charts. However, the rise of Bad Boy Records, propelled by the massive crossover success of Bad Boy head Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs&#x27;s 1997 ensemble album, &quot;No Way Out&quot;, on the heels of the media attention generated by the murders of Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G., signaled a major stylistic change in gangsta rap (or as it is referred to on the East Coast, hardcore rap), as it morphed into a new subgenre of hip hop which would become even more commercially successful and popularly accepted. Gangsta Boo, Gangsta Blac, and Ghetto Twinz released Gangsta rap albums.

The earlier, somewhat controversial crossover success enjoyed by popular gangsta rap songs like &quot;Gin and Juice&quot; gave way to gangsta rap&#x27;s becoming a widely accepted staple on the pop charts in the late 1990s. R&amp;B-styled hooks and samples of well-known soul and pop songs from the 1970s and 1980s were the staples of this sound, which was showcased primarily in Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs&#x27;s latter-day production work for The Notorious B.I.G. (&quot;Mo Money, Mo Problems&quot;), Mase (&quot;Feels So Good&quot;) and non-Bad Boy artists such as Jay-Z (&quot;Can I Get A...&quot;) and Nas (&quot;Street Dreams&quot;), which he sampled from 2Pac&#x27;s song (All Eyez On Me). Also achieving similar levels of success with a similar sound at the same time as Bad Boy was Master P and his No Limit label in New Orleans, as well as the New Orleans upstart Cash Money label. Three 6 Mafia, Lil Jon, Pitbull, and Crime Mob released &quot;crunk&quot; CDs.

By the turn of the century, the style of gangsta rap pioneered by N.W.A. had long given way to materialism regarding money, women and cars. Gangsta rap was hugely popular in the mainstream during the mid-2000s, propelled by 50 Cent&#x27;s influential &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot; album, which contained &quot;catchy&quot; and melodic music that helped its success on pop charts, while rapping about themes of guns and wealth.

==2007–2012: Kanye vs. 50 Cent battle, mainstream decline==
By the late 2000s, alternative hip hop had secured its place within the mainstream, due in part to the declining commercial viability of gangsta rap. Industry observers view the sales race between Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Graduation&quot; and 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;Curtis&quot;, both released on September 11, 2007, as a turning point for hip hop. Kanye West emerged the victor, selling nearly a million copies in the first week alone, proving that innovative rap music could be just as commercially viable as gangsta rap, if not more so. Cyhi the Prynce called it the &quot;biggest shift in our culture&quot; and that it led to the sound of new rappers like Drake. Although he designed it as a melancholic pop album rather than a rap album, West&#x27;s subsequent release &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot; would have a significant effect on hip hop music. While his decision to sing about love, loneliness, and heartache for the entirety of the album was at first heavily criticized by music audiences and the album was predicted to be a flop, its subsequent critical acclaim and commercial success encouraged other mainstream rappers to take greater creative risks with their music.

During the release of &quot;The Blueprint 3&quot;, New York rap mogul Jay-Z revealed that next studio album would be an experimental effort, stating, &quot;... it&#x27;s not gonna be a #1 album. That&#x27;s where I&#x27;m at right now. I wanna make the most experimental album I ever made.&quot; Jay-Z elaborated that like Kanye, he was unsatisfied with contemporary hip hop, was being inspired by indie-rockers like Grizzly Bear, and asserted his belief that the indie rock movement would play an important role in the continued evolution of hip-hop.

==Since 2012: Rise of drill, trap, chicano rap==

In the 2010s, a new form of gangsta rap known as drill emerged from the Midwest, gaining popularity via rappers such as Lil Durk, Chief Keef, Lil Reese, King Von, Polo G and G Herbo. West Coast rapper Vince Staples is part of the new generation of rappers that is influenced by G-funk. Vince Staples&#x27; conscious rap album &quot;Summertime &#x27;06&quot; (2015) reflects the &quot;challenges of racism, injustice, and violent fallouts in his childhood neighborhood&quot;. T.I, Rick Ross, Future, and Gucci Mane released new rap style &quot;trap&quot; CDs.

Charlie Row Campo released &quot;Stop Studio Gangstas&quot; album. Other Afroamerican and Chicano gangsta rappers who gained small success or big success include XXXTentacion, Kendrick Lamar, Ms Krazie, Knight Owl, Chino Grande, Lil Rob, Mr. Criminal, Mr. Capone-E, Mr. Sancho, ShooterGang Kony, Mozzy, YNW Melly, Pusha T, Nsanity, Jeezy (Young Jeezy), YG, Nipsey Hussle, Migos, Freddie Gibbs, Meek Mill, A$AP Mob, Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q, 21 Savage, Kodak Black 6ix9ine, Blueface, NBA Youngboy, NLE Choppa, Pop Smoke, Young Dolph and BlocBoy JB.

Gangsta rap&#x27;s pioneers have met success in other forms of pop culture as well. In 2016, N.W.A was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They were followed up by the late Tupac Shakur in 2017 who was inducted as the first solo hip hop act, under his first year of eligibility as a nominee. Other Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Hip-Hop Acts include the 2007 induction of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, who are considered pioneers of expanding the sound of Hip-Hop from disco inspired partying, to street reality that inspired social change. The 2009 induction of Run-DMC to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame opened the door for more Hip-Hop inductions, as they were followed up by the 2012 induction of Beastie Boys, and the 2013 induction of Public Enemy.

==Criticism and debate==
The explicit nature of gangsta rap&#x27;s lyrics has made it heavily controversial. There is also debate about the causation between gangsta rap and violent behavior. A study by the Prevention Research Center of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation in Berkeley, Calif., finds young people who listen to rap and hip-hop are more likely to abuse alcohol and commit violent acts. The study did not find a causal relationship between rap music and alcohol abuse and violent acts, noting that young people who engage in this behavior may listen to rap music for any number of reasons, including to fit into a subculture or to find relatable content that reflects their life experiences and trauma. A 2020 study found no causal relationship between drill music, a gangsta rap genre with notoriously violent lyrics, and real-world violence when compared to police-recorded violent crime data in London.

Critics of gangsta rap hold that it glorifies and encourages criminal behavior, and may be at least partially to blame for the existence of street gangs. 
Those who are supportive or at least less critical of gangsta rap hold that crime on the street level is for the most part a reaction to poverty and that gangsta rap reflects the reality of lower class life. Many believe that the blaming of crime on gangsta rap is a form of unwarranted moral panic; The World Development Report 2011, for instance, confirmed that most street gang members maintain that poverty and unemployment is what drove them to crime; none made reference to music. Ice Cube famously satirized the blame placed on gangsta rap for social ills in his song &quot;Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It&quot;. Many gangsta rappers maintain they are playing a &quot;role&quot; in their music like an actor in a play or film, and do not encourage the behavior in their music.

Moreover, English scholar Ronald A.T. Judy has argued that gangsta rap reflects the experience of blackness at the end of political economy, when capital is no longer wholly produced by human labor but in a globalized system of commodities. In this economy, gangsta rap traffics blackness as a commodifiable effect of &quot;being a nigga&quot;. In other words, gangsta rap defines the experience of blackness, in which he locates in gangsta rap&#x27;s deployment of the word &quot;nigga&quot;, in this new global economic system as &quot;adaptation to the force of commodification&quot;. For Judy, &quot;nigga&quot; (and gangsta rap) becomes an epistemologically authentic category for describing the condition of being black in the modern &quot;realm of things&quot;.

Despite this, many who hold that gangsta rap is not responsible for social ills are critical of the way many gangsta rappers intentionally exaggerate their criminal pasts for the sake of street credibility. Rick Ross and Slim Jesus among others have been heavily criticized for this.

===&quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot; controversy===
In 1992, then-U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle blasted the recording industry for producing rap music he believed led to violence. Quayle called on Time Warner Inc. subsidiary, Interscope Records, to withdraw Tupac Shakur&#x27;s 1991 debut album &quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot; from stores. Quayle stated, &quot;There is absolutely no reason for a record like this to be published—It has no place in our society.&quot; Quayle&#x27;s motivation came in light of the murder of a Texas state trooper Bill Davidson, who had been shot by Ronald Ray Howard after he had been pulled over. Howard was driving a stolen vehicle while songs from &quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot; were playing on the tape deck when he was stopped by the officer. The family of Davidson filed a civil suit against Shakur and Interscope Records, claiming the record&#x27;s violent lyrics incite &quot;imminent lawless action&quot;. District Judge John D. Rainey held that Shakur and the record companies did not have the duty to prevent distributing his music when they could not reasonably foresee violence arising from the distribution, nor was there any intent for the usage of the music as a &quot;product for purposes of recovery under a products liability theory&quot;. Judge Rainey concluded the suit by ruling the Davidsons&#x27; argument that the music was unprotected speech under the First Amendment was irrelevant.

===C. Delores Tucker===
Politicians such as C. Delores Tucker have cited concerns with sexually explicit and misogynistic lyrics featured in hip-hop tracks. Tucker claimed the explicit lyrics used in hip-hop songs were threatening to the African-American community. Tucker, who once was the highest-ranking African American woman in the Pennsylvania state government, focused on rap music in 1993, labeling it as &quot;pornographic filth&quot; and claiming it was offensive and demeaning to black women. Tucker stated, &quot;You can&#x27;t listen to all that language and filth without it affecting you.&quot; Tucker also handed out leaflets containing lyrics from rap music and urged people to read them aloud. She picketed stores that sold the music and handed out petitions. She then proceeded to buy stock in Time Warner, Sony and other companies for the sole purpose to protest rap music at shareholders meetings. In 1994, Tucker protested when the NAACP nominated rapper Tupac Shakur for one of its image awards as Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture from his role in &quot;Poetic Justice&quot;.

Some rappers labeled her &quot;narrow-minded&quot;, and some ridiculed her in their lyrics, notably Shakur, who mentions her multiple times in his diamond certified 1996 album &quot;All Eyez On Me&quot;. Shakur mentions Tucker in the tracks &quot;Wonda Why They Call U Bitch&quot; and &quot;How Do U Want It&quot;, where Shakur raps &quot;Delores Tucker, you&#x27;s a motherfucker/Instead of trying to help a nigga you destroy a brother.&quot; Tucker filed a $10 million lawsuit against Shakur&#x27;s estate for the comments made in both songs. In her lawsuit, she claimed that the comments were slanderous, caused her emotional distress and invaded her personal privacy. The case was eventually dismissed. Shakur was not the only rap artist to mention her in his songs, as Jay-Z, Eminem, Lil&#x27; Kim, the Game and Lil Wayne have all previously criticized Tucker for her opposition of the genre.

===First Amendment rights===
Gangsta rap has also raised questions of whether it is protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, since lyrics may express violence and may be considered true threats. The Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Elonis v. United States&quot; (2015) that &quot;mens rea&quot;, the intent to commit a crime, is necessary to convict someone of a crime for using threatening words in a rap song.

In a notable case, rapper Jamal Knox, performing as &quot;Mayhem Mal&quot;, wrote a gangsta rap song named &quot;F*** the Police&quot; shortly after he was arrested for gun and drug charges in Pittsburgh. The song&#x27;s lyrics specifically named the two arresting officers, and included explicit violent threats including &quot;Let&#x27;s kill these cops cuz they don&#x27;t do us no good&quot;. One of the officers, believing to be threatened, subsequently left the force.

Knox was convicted of making terroristic threats and of witness intimidation in a bench trial, and the conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which held that the song&#x27;s lyrics amounted to a true threat. Knox petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States to hear the case, and academics joined rappers Killer Mike, Chance the Rapper, Meek Mill, Yo Gotti, Fat Joe and 21 Savage in an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief arguing that Knox&#x27;s song should be seen as a political statement and thus is protected speech. The Supreme Court declined review in April 2019.

==International influence==
===German gangsta-rap===

The gangsta-rap movement in Germany derived its roots from the 1990s; since 2003–2004, it has become a successful subgenre of German hip hop. Contextually and musically, it borrows its influences from the French and US-based gangsta rap and battle rap. Although there is a certain correlation between street-rap and gangsta-rap, gangsta-rap is not considered as a derivative genre since it is only partially related to street-rap and has contextually little to do with the other subgenre.

====History====
Pioneers of the subgenre gangsta-rap, who have been active since the 1990s, are Kool Savas and Azad. Within the genre, they implemented an incredibly explicit, broken and aggressive text, that originally still had much influence from English text elements. This style of rap, after the turn of the century, was implemented by the majority of gangsta-rappers in Germany and is, therefore, a very well respected form on the approach of German gangsta-rap. On the other hand, Savas distanced himself from these vulgar and explicit texts. One of the founding fathers of German gangsta-rap, Charnell, the little-known rapper and martial-arts artist, thematized growing up in the midst of a social renaissance. Gangsta-rap in other countries, that resembled the music of the Rödelheim Hartreim Projekt in Germany, was commercially successful in the 2000s. Germany at the time, however, had few rappers active in this subgenre; allowing certain artists in the Berlin underground-hip-hop scene an opportunity to establish themselves with their lyrics representing a certain hardship acquired through the criminal lifestyle which had previously been popularized. Recognizable names from the underground scene are Bass Sultan Hengzt, Fler, MC Bogy or MOK. Another notable rapper and pioneer of gangsta-rap in Germany is Azad. Although he came from the rural Frankfurt am Main, he was a big reason this subgenre became popular in Germany. In his lyrical text, he thematized the rigid and rough lifestyle of living in the northwest district of Frankfurt.

At the beginning of 2003, the process of commercialization of this subgenre began. Contrary to popular belief, a variable of the German gangsta-rap became popular before the actual subgenre itself did. When Sido, a notoriously known rapper from Berlin, released his album &quot;Maske&quot; which thematized gangs, drugs and violence, this album became the first of its genre to sell 100,000 copies. Following that album Sido released another two named &quot;Ich&quot; and &quot;Ich und meine Maske&quot; which both had over 100,000 sold copies and emphasized the success of his first album.

Following the success of Sido and his albums, Bushido became the next artist to emerge from the German gangsta-rap scene. He established himself a career and became the most important representative of German gangsta-rap of his time. Aggro Berlin, the label those two artists were both represented by, stated that this version of rap was the second, more aggressive evolution of German hip-hop. Bushido&#x27;s albums &quot;Carlo Cokxxx Nutten&quot; with Fler and Bushido&#x27;s debut album &quot;Vom Bordstein bis zur Skyline&quot; had relatively little success although the prominent topics on his album reflected directly with the themes that made Sido popular.

Following the continuous success of Sido and Bushido came a wave of rappers who were trying, with the help of major-labels, to establish themselves and be recognized by the populace. Eventually came Massiv, who was signed with Sony BMG, and was crowned by his label to be the German 50 Cent. This artist did not reach the success of 50 Cent. Further artists such as Baba Saad or Kollegah have since then established themselves as relatively successful in the German charts. As of recently, names such as Farid Bang, Nate57, Majoe &amp; Jasko and Haftbefehl have appeared on the charts regularly.

===Road rap===

Road rap (also known as British gangsta rap or simply UK rap) is a genre of music pioneered in South London, primarily in Brixton and Peckham. The genre was pioneered by groups such as PDC, SMS, SN1, North Star, MashTown, U.S.G. and artists such as Giggs, K Koke, Nines and Sneakbo. The genre came to the fore as a backlash against the perceived commercialisation of grime in the mid-late 2000s in London. The genre came to prominence around 2007 with the rise of Giggs. Road rap retained the explicit depictions of violence and British gang culture found in some early grime music and combines it with a musical style more similar to American gangsta rap than the sound system influenced music of grime, dubstep, UK garage, jungle, reggae and dub.

Gangs played a large part in the genre, with gangs such as the Peckham Boys (with its various sets such as SN1, PYG and OPB), based in Peckham and GAS Gang, based in Brixton, becoming notable in the road rap scene during the 2000s.

The road rap scene centres around mixtape releases and YouTube videos with some of the genres more popular acts getting mainstream recognition. The genre has been criticised for the relentless nihilism and violence in its lyrics as well as its links to gangs and gun crime with many rappers serving prison sentences. In keeping with grime, road rap has suffered from pre-emptive policing with Giggs claiming that the Metropolitan Police have set out to deny him the opportunity to make a living from music having banned him from touring. In 2011, Stigs was served the first ever gang injunction that banned him from rapping about anything that may encourage violence.

In the early 2010s, the American genre drill began to emerge in the UK, pushed by groups such as 150, 67 and Section Boyz. UK drill has been referred to as subgenre of road rap due to the influence it has had on the genre. Road rap also went on to influence afroswing, which emerged in the mid-2010s.

<text>The Nazi term  (), meaning &quot;synchronization&quot; or &quot;bringing into line&quot;, was the process of Nazification by which Adolf Hitler—leader of the Nazi Party in Germany—established a system of totalitarian control and coordination over all aspects of German society &quot;from the economy and trade associations to the media, culture and education&quot;.

Although the Weimar Constitution remained nominally in effect throughout Hitler&#x27;s dictatorship, near total Nazification was achieved by 1935 with the resolutions approved during that year&#x27;s Nuremberg Rally, fusing the symbols of the party and the state (see Flag of Nazi Germany) and depriving German Jews of their citizenship (see Nuremberg Laws). The tenets of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot;, including the Nuremberg Laws, also applied to territories occupied by the German Reich.

==Terminology==
 is a compound word that comes from the German words (same) and (circuit) and was derived from an electrical engineering term meaning that all switches are put on the same circuit allowing them all to be activated by throwing a single master switch. Its first use is credited to Reich Justice Minister Franz Gürtner. It has been variously translated as &quot;coordination&quot;, &quot;Nazification of state and society&quot;, &quot;synchronization&quot;, and &quot;bringing into line&quot;. English texts often use the untranslated German word to convey its unique historical meaning. In their seminal work on National Socialist vernacular, &quot;Nazi-Deutsch/Nazi-German: An English Lexicon of the Language of the Third Reich&quot;, historians Robert Michael and Karin Doerr define as: &quot;Consolidation. All of the German Volk&#x27;s social, political, and cultural organizations to be controlled and run according to Nazi ideology and policy. All opposition to be eliminated.&quot; This accords with the general description provided by historian Jane Caplan, who characterized the term as &quot;the coordination of German institutions into a cohesive, Nazified whole.&quot;

==Legal basis==
The Nazis were able to put into effect due to multiple legal measures enacted by the Reich government during the 20 months following 30 January 1933, when Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany.

* &quot;Reichstag&quot; Fire Decree. The day after the Reichstag fire, President of Germany Paul von Hindenburg, acting at Hitler&#x27;s request and based on the emergency powers in article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, issued the Reichstag Fire Decree (28 February 1933). This decree, formally titled &quot;Decree of the Reich President for the Protection of People and State,&quot; suspended most civil rights and civil liberties enshrined in the constitution, including the right of &quot;habeas corpus,&quot; freedom of speech, press, assembly and privacy of communications. This allowed for the arrest of political adversaries, mostly Communists, and for terrorizing of other voters by the (SA) (Nazi paramilitary branch) before the upcoming election. In this atmosphere, the general election of the took place on 5 March 1933. The Nazis had hoped to win an outright majority and push aside their coalition partners, the German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP). However, the Nazis won only 43.9 percent of the vote, short of a majority and well below the number needed to amend the federal constitution. 

* Enabling Act. When the newly elected convened – not including the Communist delegates whose participation in politics had been banned – it passed the Enabling Act (23 March 1933). This law, formally titled &quot;Law to Remedy the Distress of the People and the Reich,&quot; gave the government (the Reich Chancellor and his cabinet) the right to enact laws for a period of four years without the involvement of the &quot;Reichstag&quot; or the Reich President. Under certain circumstances, these laws could &quot;deviate from the Constitution.&quot; As a constitutional amendment, it required a two-thirds majority for passage. Even with the proscription of the Communists, the Nazis and their ally the DNVP were still short of this number. Through intimidation of deputies by surrounding the &quot;Reichstag&quot; with a cordon of SA members, and through promises of religious freedom protections to the Catholic Centre Party, the required supermajority was obtained. With only the SPD in opposition, the Enabling Act passed 444–94. For all intents and purposes, the entire Weimar Constitution was rendered void. It formed the cornerstone on which Hitler circumvented the constitutional framework of the Weimar Republic and was able to impose his will on the nation by decree. For all intents and purposes, it converted his government into a legal dictatorship. 
* Provisional Law on the Coordination of the States with the Reich. Enacted by the Reich government using the Enabling Act, the &quot;Provisional Law on the Coordination of the States with the Reich&quot; (31 March 1933) dissolved the sitting parliaments of all German states except the recently elected Prussian parliament, which the Nazis already controlled. It also ordered the state parliaments reconstituted based on the state votes cast in the 5 March &quot;Reichstag&quot; election (except for Communist seats, which were not filled). Under this provision, the Nazis and their DNVP partners were able to attain working majorities in all the parliaments. It further mandated the simultaneous dissolution of all state parliaments after the &quot;Reichstag&quot; was dissolved. It also gave the state governments the same powers to enact legislation that the Reich government possessed under the Enabling Act.
* Second Law on the Coordination of the States with the Reich. In order to further extend their power over the German states, the Reich government enacted the &quot;Second Law on the Coordination of the States with the Reich&quot; (7 April 1933). This measure deployed one (Reich Governor) in each state. These officers, appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Chancellor, were responsible to Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick and were intended to act as local proconsuls in each state, with near-complete control over the state governments. They were empowered to preside over meetings of the state government, appoint and dismiss the state minister-president as well as other high officials and judges, dissolve the state parliament, call new elections and promulgate state laws. The law conferred the office of in Prussia on the Reich Chancellor himself.
* Law for the Restoration of a Professional Civil Service. Another measure of Nazi was the enactment of the &quot;Law for the Restoration of a Professional Civil Service&quot; (7 April 1933), which mandated the &quot;co-ordination&quot; of the civil service – which in Germany included not only bureaucrats, but also schoolteachers and professors, judges, prosecutors, and other professionals – at the federal, state and municipal level, and authorized the removal of Jews and Communists from these positions, with limited exceptions for those who had fought in the First World War or had lost a father or son in combat.
* Law on the Trustees of Labour. On 2 May 1933, trade union offices were attacked and occupied by SA stormtroopers. The offices were closed, their newspapers shuttered, funds confiscated and leaders arrested. In order to impose coordination on private sector workers, the Law on the Trustees of Labour (19 May 1933) established the position of Trustee of Labour, each of which was assigned to one of thirteen large economic areas (&quot;Wirtschaftsgebiete&quot;). They were charged with ensuring industrial peace and regulating employment contracts, including the setting of wages and the resolution of employer–employee disputes. This effectively supplanted collective bargaining and strikes, as the trustees were authorized to impose legally-binding settlements.
* Law Against the Formation of Parties. The Communist Party had effectively been outlawed in all but name by the Reichstag Fire Decree, and was completely banned from 6 March. Following additional months of violence and intimidation against the Social Democratic Party, the government seized all its assets, and banned it outright on 22 June 1933, canceling all SPD electoral mandates in both the &quot;Reichstag&quot; and the state parliaments. By early July, all other parties, even the Nazis&#x27; erstwhile allies the DNVP, had been intimidated into dissolving themselves rather than face arrests and concentration camp imprisonment. Thus the DNVP (27 June) the German State Party (28 June), the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party (4 July), the German People&#x27;s Party (4 July) and the Centre Party (5 July) all formally disbanded. The &quot;Law Against the Formation of Parties&quot; (14 July 1933) declared the NSDAP as the country&#x27;s only legal political party, formalizing what had already been accomplished through the campaign of Nazi terror and the complete capitulation of the opposition.

* Law to Secure the Unity of Party and State. With the Nazi Party as the only remaining legal party, Hitler now sought to extend the Party&#x27;s grasp over all the levers of state power and administration through the &quot;Law to Secure the Unity of Party and State&quot; (1 December 1933), which was enacted by the Reich government under the provisions of the Enabling Act. The Nazi Party was legally established as a public corporation with jurisdiction over its members. The Party and the SA became official organs of the German Reich. The Deputy &quot;Führer&quot; of the Party (Rudolf Hess) and the &quot;Stabschef&quot; of the SA (Ernst Röhm), were made &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the Reich government as ministers without portfolio, further interlocking the leadership of the Party and State. Government agencies, including public safety and law enforcement authorities such as the police, public prosecutors and the courts, were obligated to provide the Party and the SA with administrative and legal information and investigatory assistance. Party courts (&quot;Parteigerichte&quot;) received the status of official legal institutions of the State and any crime committed against the Party now was considered a crime against the State. These courts were now authorized to impose detention or imprisonment as punishment.
* Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich. All the state parliaments had been dissolved (along with the &quot;Reichstag&quot;) on 14 October 1933, and while new &quot;Reichstag&quot; elections took place on 12 November, no new state parliamentary elections were scheduled. Now, on the one-year anniversary of coming to power, the Reich government passed through the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, by a unanimous vote, the &quot;Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich&quot; (30 January 1934). This was one of only seven laws passed by the &quot;Reichstag&quot; in the 19 sessions held during the entire Nazi regime, as opposed to 986 laws enacted solely by the Reich government under the authority of the Enabling Act. The law, in the form of a constitutional amendment, formally did away with the concept of a federal republic. The state parliaments were abolished altogether and state sovereignty passed to the Reich government. The states, though not themselves eliminated, were reduced to mere administrative bodies subordinated to the Reich, effectively converting Germany into a highly centralized unitary state. By destroying the autonomy of the historic German states, Hitler achieved what Bismarck, Wilhelm II and the Weimar Republic had never dared to attempt.
* Law on the Abolition of the &quot;Reichsrat.&quot; Within two weeks of the abolition of the state parliaments, the Reich government enacted the &quot;Law on the Abolition of the Reichsrat&quot; (14 February 1934) formally abolishing the &quot;Reichsrat&quot;, the second chamber of the national parliament that represented the states. This was a clear violation of the Enabling Act. While Article 2 of the Enabling Act allowed the government to pass laws that deviated from the Constitution, it explicitly protected the existence of the &quot;Reichstag&quot; and &quot;Reichsrat&quot;. 
* Law Concerning the Head of State of the German Reich. With Reich President von Hindenburg fatally ill, the Reich government enacted the &quot;Law Concerning the Head of State of the German Reich&quot; (1 August 1934). This law was signed by the entire Reich cabinet. It combined the office of Reich President with that of Reich Chancellor under the title of &quot;&quot;Führer&quot; and Reich Chancellor,&quot; and was drawn up to become effective on the death of the Reich President, which occurred the next day. Again, this flagrantly violated Article 2 of the Enabling Act, which forbade any actions interfering with the office of the Reich President. With this law, Hitler became not only Germany&#x27;s head of state, but also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. It also removed the last remedy by which Hitler could be legally removed from office, and with it all checks on his power.

==Coordination of the German &quot;Länder&quot;==

When Hitler was appointed Reich Chancellor on 30 January 1933, the Nazi Party had control of only five of the 17 German &quot;Länder&quot; (states). But the Nazis acted swiftly to eliminate any potential centers of opposition in the remaining states. Immediately after the Reichstag election of 5 March 1933, the central government began in earnest its campaign to take over the state governments it did not yet control, and within a very short period it achieved dominance over the administration in every state.

The pattern was in each case similar: pressure on the non-Nazi state governments to place a National Socialist in charge of the police; threatening demonstrations from SA and SS troops in the big cities; the symbolic raising of the swastika banner on town halls; the capitulation with hardly any resistance of the elected governments; the imposition of a Reich Commissar under the pretext of restoring order … Despite the semblance of legality, the usurpation of the powers of the &quot;Länder&quot; by the Reich was a plain breach of the Constitution. Force and pressure by the Nazi organizations themselves—political blackmail–had been solely responsible for creating the &#x27;unrest&#x27; that had prompted the alleged restorations of &#x27;order&#x27;. The terms of the emergency decree of 28 February provided no justification since there was plainly no need for defence from any &#x27;communist acts of violence endangering the state&#x27;. The only such acts were those of the Nazis themselves.

Most coalition cabinets that the Nazis formed were with the participation of their conservative nationalist ally, the German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP). The &quot;Law Against the Founding of New Parties&quot; (14 July 1933) banned all parties except the Nazi Party. The DNVP members of the remaining coalition cabinets eventually either joined the Party or were replaced by Nazis, resulting in one-party government in all the &quot;Länder&quot;.

The following table presents an overview of the process of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; as it was applied to the Nazification of the German &quot;Länder&quot; governments. While, strictly speaking, &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; did not start until after the Nazi seizure of power at the Reich level at the end of January 1933, the table also presents earlier Nazi Party successes in infiltrating and taking charge of several German state administrations during 1930–1932. In most of these instances, they took the portfolio of the state interior ministries from which they controlled the police, installing Nazi adherents and purging opponents. 

==Propaganda and societal integration==

One of the most critical steps towards of German society was the introduction of the &quot;Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda&quot; under Joseph Goebbels in March 1933 and the subsequent steps the Propaganda Ministry took to assume complete control of the press and all means of social communication. This included oversight of newspapers, magazines, films, books, public meetings and ceremonies, foreign press relations, theater, art and music, radio, and television. To this end, Goebbels said:

[T]he secret of propaganda [is to] permeate the person it aims to grasp, without his even noticing that he is being permeated. &quot;Of course&quot; propaganda has a purpose, but the purpose must be concealed with such cleverness and virtuosity that the person on whom this purpose is to be carried out doesn&#x27;t notice it at all.

This was also the purpose of &quot;co-ordination&quot;: to ensure that every aspect of the lives of German citizens was permeated with the ideas and prejudices of the Nazis. From March to July 1933 and continuing afterward, the Nazi Party systematically eliminated or co-opted non-Nazi organizations that could potentially influence people. Those critical of Hitler and the Nazis were suppressed, intimidated, or murdered.

Every national voluntary association, and every local club, was brought under Nazi control, from industrial and agricultural pressure groups to sports associations, football clubs, male voice choirs, women&#x27;s organizations—in short, the whole fabric of associational life was Nazified. Rival, politically oriented clubs or societies were merged into a single Nazi body. Existing leaders of voluntary associations were either unceremoniously ousted, or knuckled under of their own accord. Many organizations expelled leftish or liberal members and declared their allegiance to the new state and its institutions. The whole process ... went on all over Germany. ... By the end, virtually the only non-Nazi associations left were the army and the Churches with their lay organizations.

For example, in 1934, the government founded the &quot;Deutscher Reichsbund für Leibesübungen&quot;, later the &quot;Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund für Leibesübungen&quot;, as the official sports governing body. All other German sport associations gradually lost their freedom and were coopted into it. Besides sports, another more important part of the &quot;co-ordination&quot; effort was the purging of the civil service, both at the Federal and state level. Top Federal civil servants—the State Secretaries—were largely replaced if they were not sympathetic to the Nazi program, as were the equivalent bureaucrats in the states, but Nazification took place at every level. Civil servants rushed to join the Nazi Party, fearing they would lose their jobs if they did not. At the local level, mayors and councils were terrorized by Nazi stormtroopers of the SA and SS into resigning or following orders to replace officials and workers at local public institutions who were Jewish or belonged to other political parties.

The &#x27; also included the formation of various organizations with compulsory membership for segments of the population, particularly the youth of Germany. Boys first served as apprentices in the (cubs), beginning at the age of six, and at age ten, entered the (Young German Boys) and served there until joining the Hitler Youth proper at age fourteen. Boys remained there until age eighteen, at which time they entered into the (Labor Service) and the armed forces. Girls became part of the (Young Maidens) at age ten and at age fourteen were enrolled in the &#x27; (League of German Maidens). At eighteen, BDM members generally went to the eastern territory for their , or , a year of labor on a farm. By 1940, membership in the Hitler Youth numbered some eight million.

==Coordination of the trade union movement==
The German trade union movement had a long history, dating to the mid-nineteenth-century. At the time of the Weimar Republic, its largest grouping was the General German Trade Union Federation (ADGB). This was an umbrella organization that was formed in July 1919 and was originally composed of 52 unions with about 8 million workers. It was generally affiliated with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and was on the left of the political spectrum. In March 1920, it was instrumental in calling a general strike that led to the collapse of the right-wing Kapp Putsch that attempted to overthrow the republic. It was led from January 1921 by Theodor Leipart. Following the economic downturn of 1929, the resulting sharp rise in unemployment caused a large drop-off in membership but, by 1932, it still represented an estimated 3.5 million workers in some 30 unions. 

When the Nazis came to power at the end of January 1933, there was some sentiment for a general strike by SPD politicians and trade unionists, but the national leadership was wary of such an action in the face of the worst unemployment crisis the nation had experienced. Though there were some sporadic isolated incidents, no general policy of resistance was undertaken. The Nazis embarked on a policy of violence and intimidation against all their opponents, including the SPD-affiliated trade unions. In an effort to safeguard his organization and its members, Leipart declared the ADBG politically &quot;neutral&quot; within weeks of the Nazis coming to power. Meanwhile, Party leaders convinced conservative elements among the police, the judiciary, prison administrators and civil servants that suppression of the labor movement was justified.

Following the Nazi gains in the Reichstag election of 5 March 1933, violent episodes increased in intensity, with SA stormtroopers ransacking trade union offices, assaulting staff, destroying furniture and equipment, stealing funds and burning documents. By 25 March, union offices in some 45 towns throughout the Reich had been attacked. At this point, the trade unions began to distance themselves from the SPD in an attempt to seek an accommodation with the regime. On 28 April, the ADGB agreed to move toward unification with the conservative Christian and the bourgeois liberal trade union groups, to form a single national labor organization in the new Nazi state. Leipart also supported the announcement by Goebbels that May Day would be celebrated as a public holiday for the first time, a long-sought goal of the labor movement. But any efforts at reconciliation on the unions&#x27; part proved futile, as the Nazis had already begun to plot a complete takeover of the trade union movement, as demonstrated by Goebbels&#x27;s diary entry of 17 April:

On 1 May we shall arrange May Day as a grandiose demonstration of the German people&#x27;s will. On 2 May the trade union offices will be occupied. Coordination in this area too. There might possibly be a row for a few days, but then they will belong to us. We must make no allowances anymore. … Once the trade unions are in our hands the other parties and organizations will not be able to hold out for much longer.

Accordingly, 1 May 1933 was declared the Day of National Labor, a day of parades, speeches and propaganda displays to celebrate the unity of the German labor movement with the nation, featuring SA military bands, swastika flags and fireworks. It culminated with a huge rally and speech by Hitler at Berlin Tempelhof Airport that was attended by over one million people. Many workers, particularly those in state employment, were compelled to participate by threats of dismissal for not attending. The next day, as Goebbels had indicated, the German labor movement was crushed under a wave of unprecedented violence at the hands of SA and SS troops. All SPD-supported trade union offices were occupied, their newspapers and periodicals were discontinued, their banks and credit unions were closed, and their assets were confiscated and turned over to the National Socialist Factory Cell Organization. Leipart and other union leaders were taken into &quot;protective custody&quot; and sent to concentration camps. Violence was inflicted on many and, in the most brutal incident, four union officials were beaten to death in Duisburg.
Two days later, other non-SPD-aligned union amalgamations, such as the conservative German National Association of Commercial Employees and the liberal , placed themselves under the Action Committee for the Protection of German Labor, headed by Robert Ley, the &quot;Stabschef&quot; (chief of staff) of the Nazi Party organization. The last remaining union umbrella agency, the Christian-oriented was absorbed at the end of June. Throughout this process, there were no strikes, no demonstrations and no protests. Even the Nazis were surprised. The most highly organized and powerful trade union movement in Europe offered no resistance and disappeared virtually overnight.

In its place, the German Labor Front ( or DAF), a Nazi Party organization led by Ley, was established on 10 May. Its goal was coordination of the entire labor force under Nazi leadership. On 19 May, the government enacted the Law on the Trustees of Labour that decreed an end to collective bargaining. It established Trustees of Labour, who were appointed by Hitler and charged with regulating labor contracts and maintaining labor peace. Since their decisions were legally binding, strikes were effectively outlawed.

===Strength Through Joy===
An all-embracing recreational organization for workers, called (&quot;Strength Through Joy&quot;) was set up under the auspices of the German Labor Front. Hobbies were regimented and all private clubs, whether chess, football, or woodworking, were brought under the control of Strength Through Joy, which also provided vacation trips, skiing, swimming, concerts, and ocean cruises. Some 43 million Germans enjoyed trips via the Strength Through Joy initiative. This effort inspired the idea of Germans acquiring automobiles and the construction of the &quot;Autobahn&quot;. It was the largest of the many organizations the Nazis established and a propaganda success. Workers were also brought in line with the party through activities such as the , a national vocational competition. Many unemployed people were also drafted into the Reich Labour Service, where they were given uniforms and tools and put to work; the disappearance of unemployed people from the streets contributed to the perception that the Nazis were improving Germany&#x27;s economic conditions.

==Implications==
Historian Claudia Koonz explains that the word stems from the arena of electricity, where it refers to converting power from alternating current to direct current, which is called &quot;rectification&quot; in English; the word translates literally as &quot;phasing&quot;. Used in its sociopolitical sense, has no equivalent in any other language. The Nazis also used other similar terms, such as , which constituted the removal or &quot;switching off&quot; of anyone who stained or soiled the German nation. This seemingly clinical terminology captured both the mechanical and biological meaning for members of German society; as one German citizen visiting London explained, &quot;It means the same stream will flow through the ethnic body politic [].&quot;

Former University of Dresden professor of romance languages Viktor Klemperer—dismissed from his post for being Jewish in 1935—collected a list of terms Nazis employed in everyday speech, which he discussed in his book, &quot;LTI – Lingua Tertii Imperii&quot;, published in English as &quot;The Language of the Third Reich&quot;. In this work, Klemperer contends that the Nazis made the German language itself a servant to their ideology through its repetitive use, eventually permeating its people&#x27;s very &quot;flesh and blood&quot;. For instance, if it was sunny and pleasant, it was &quot;Hitler weather&quot;, or if you failed to comply with Nazi ideals of racial and social conformity, you were &quot;switched off.&quot;

When the blatant emphasis on racial hatred of others seemed to reach an impasse in the school system, through radio broadcasts, or on film reels, the overseers of Nazi propaganda switched to strategies that focused more on togetherness and the &quot;we-consciousness&quot; of the collective Volk, but the mandates of Nazi &quot;coordination&quot; remained: pay homage to the Führer, expel all foreigners, sacrifice for the German people, and welcome future challenges. While greater German social and economic unity was produced through the regime&#x27;s &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; initiatives, it was at the expense of individuality and to the social detriment of any nonconformist; worse, it contributed to and reinforced the social and racial exclusion of anyone National Socialist doctrine deemed an enemy. The Nazi or &quot;synchronization&quot; of German society—along with a series of Nazi legislation—was part and parcel to Jewish economic disenfranchisement, the violence against political opposition, the creation of concentration camps, the Nuremberg Laws, the establishment of a racial , the seeking of , and the violent mass destruction of human life deemed somehow less valuable by the National Socialist government of Germany.

<doc id="12216" wikidata="Q76420" url="?curid=12216" title="Georg Cantor">
<text>Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor ( ; ;  – 6 January 1918) was a mathematician who played a pivotal role in the creation of set theory, which has become a fundamental theory in mathematics. Cantor established the importance of one-to-one correspondence between the members of two sets, defined infinite and well-ordered sets, and proved that the real numbers are more numerous than the natural numbers. Cantor&#x27;s method of proof of this theorem implies the existence of an infinity of infinities. He defined the cardinal and ordinal numbers and their arithmetic. Cantor&#x27;s work is of great philosophical interest, a fact he was well aware of.

Originally, Cantor&#x27;s theory of transfinite numbers was regarded as counter-intuitive – even shocking. This caused it to encounter resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker and Henri Poincaré and later from Hermann Weyl and L. E. J. Brouwer, while Ludwig Wittgenstein raised philosophical objections; see Controversy over Cantor&#x27;s theory. Cantor, a devout Lutheran Christian, believed the theory had been communicated to him by God. Some Christian theologians (particularly neo-Scholastics) saw Cantor&#x27;s work as a challenge to the uniqueness of the absolute infinity in the nature of God – on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism – a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected. Not all theologians were against Cantor&#x27;s theory; prominent neo-scholastic philosopher Constantin Gutberlet was in favor of it and Cardinal Johann Baptist Franzelin accepted it as a valid theory (after Cantor made some important clarifications).

The objections to Cantor&#x27;s work were occasionally fierce: Leopold Kronecker&#x27;s public opposition and personal attacks included describing Cantor as a &quot;scientific charlatan&quot;, a &quot;renegade&quot; and a &quot;corrupter of youth&quot;. Kronecker objected to Cantor&#x27;s proofs that the algebraic numbers are countable, and that the transcendental numbers are uncountable, results now included in a standard mathematics curriculum. Writing decades after Cantor&#x27;s death, Wittgenstein lamented that mathematics is &quot;ridden through and through with the pernicious idioms of set theory&quot;, which he dismissed as &quot;utter nonsense&quot; that is &quot;laughable&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;. Cantor&#x27;s recurring bouts of depression from 1884 to the end of his life have been blamed on the hostile attitude of many of his contemporaries, though some have explained these episodes as probable manifestations of a bipolar disorder.

The harsh criticism has been matched by later accolades. In 1904, the Royal Society awarded Cantor its Sylvester Medal, the highest honor it can confer for work in mathematics. David Hilbert defended it from its critics by declaring, &quot;No one shall expel us from the paradise that Cantor has created.&quot;

== Biography ==

===Youth and studies===

Georg Cantor, born in 1845 in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, was brought up in that city until the age of eleven. The oldest of six children, he was regarded as an outstanding violinist. His grandfather Franz Böhm (1788–1846) (the violinist Joseph Böhm&#x27;s brother) was a well-known musician and soloist in a Russian imperial orchestra. Cantor&#x27;s father had been a member of the Saint Petersburg stock exchange; when he became ill, the family moved to Germany in 1856, first to Wiesbaden, then to Frankfurt, seeking milder winters than those of Saint Petersburg. In 1860, Cantor graduated with distinction from the Realschule in Darmstadt; his exceptional skills in mathematics, trigonometry in particular, were noted. In August 1862, he then graduated from the &quot;Höhere Gewerbeschule Darmstadt&quot;, now the Technische Universität Darmstadt. In 1862 Cantor entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich. After receiving a substantial inheritance upon his father&#x27;s death in June 1863, Cantor transferred to the University of Berlin, attending lectures by Leopold Kronecker, Karl Weierstrass and Ernst Kummer. He spent the summer of 1866 at the University of Göttingen, then and later a center for mathematical research. Cantor was a good student, and he received his doctoral degree in 1867.

===Teacher and researcher===
Cantor submitted his dissertation on number theory at the University of Berlin in 1867. After teaching briefly in a Berlin girls&#x27; school, he took up a position at the University of Halle, where he spent his entire career. He was awarded the requisite habilitation for his thesis, also on number theory, which he presented in 1869 upon his appointment at Halle.

In 1874, Cantor married Vally Guttmann. They had six children, the last (Rudolph) born in 1886. Cantor was able to support a family despite his modest academic pay, thanks to his inheritance from his father. During his honeymoon in the Harz mountains, Cantor spent much time in mathematical discussions with Richard Dedekind, whom he had met at Interlaken in Switzerland
two years earlier while on holiday.

Cantor was promoted to extraordinary professor in 1872 and made full professor in 1879. To attain the latter rank at the age of 34 was a notable accomplishment, but Cantor desired a chair at a more prestigious university, in particular at Berlin, at that time the leading German university. However, his work encountered too much opposition for that to be possible. Kronecker, who headed mathematics at Berlin until his death in 1891, became increasingly uncomfortable with the prospect of having Cantor as a colleague, perceiving him as a &quot;corrupter of youth&quot; for teaching his ideas to a younger generation of mathematicians. Worse yet, Kronecker, a well-established figure within the mathematical community and Cantor&#x27;s former professor, disagreed fundamentally with the thrust of Cantor&#x27;s work ever since he had intentionally delayed the publication of Cantor&#x27;s first major publication in 1874. Kronecker, now seen as one of the founders of the constructive viewpoint in mathematics, disliked much of Cantor&#x27;s set theory because it asserted the existence of sets satisfying certain properties, without giving specific examples of sets whose members did indeed satisfy those properties. Whenever Cantor applied for a post in Berlin, he was declined, and the process usually involved Kronecker, so Cantor came to believe that Kronecker&#x27;s stance would make it impossible for him ever to leave Halle.

In 1881, Cantor&#x27;s Halle colleague Eduard Heine died. Halle accepted Cantor&#x27;s suggestion that Heine&#x27;s vacant chair be offered to Dedekind, Heinrich M. Weber and Franz Mertens, in that order, but each declined the chair after being offered it. Friedrich Wangerin was eventually appointed, but he was never close to Cantor.

In 1882, the mathematical correspondence between Cantor and Dedekind came to an end, apparently as a result of Dedekind&#x27;s declining the chair at Halle. Cantor also began another important correspondence, with Gösta Mittag-Leffler in Sweden, and soon began to publish in Mittag-Leffler&#x27;s journal &quot;Acta Mathematica&quot;. But in 1885, Mittag-Leffler was concerned about the philosophical nature and new terminology in a paper Cantor had submitted to &quot;Acta&quot;. He asked Cantor to withdraw the paper from &quot;Acta&quot; while it was in proof, writing that it was &quot;... about one hundred years too soon.&quot; Cantor complied, but then curtailed his relationship and correspondence with Mittag-Leffler, writing to a third party, &quot;Had Mittag-Leffler had his way, I should have to wait until the year 1984, which to me seemed too great a demand! ... But of course I never want to know anything again about &quot;Acta Mathematica&quot;.&quot;

Cantor suffered his first known bout of depression in May 1884. Criticism of his work weighed on his mind: every one of the fifty-two letters he wrote to Mittag-Leffler in 1884 mentioned Kronecker. A passage from one of these letters is revealing of the damage to Cantor&#x27;s self-confidence:

This crisis led him to apply to lecture on philosophy rather than on mathematics. He also began an intense study of Elizabethan literature, thinking there might be evidence that Francis Bacon wrote the plays attributed to William Shakespeare (see Shakespearean authorship question); this ultimately resulted in two pamphlets, published in 1896 and 1897.

Cantor recovered soon thereafter, and subsequently made further important contributions, including his diagonal argument and theorem. However, he never again attained the high level of his remarkable papers of 1874–84, even after Kronecker&#x27;s death on 29 December 1891. He eventually sought, and achieved, a reconciliation with Kronecker. Nevertheless, the philosophical disagreements and difficulties dividing them persisted.

In 1889, Cantor was instrumental in founding the German Mathematical Society, and he chaired its first meeting in Halle in 1891, where he first introduced his diagonal argument; his reputation was strong enough, despite Kronecker&#x27;s opposition to his work, to ensure he was elected as the first president of this society. Setting aside the animosity Kronecker had displayed towards him, Cantor invited him to address the meeting, but Kronecker was unable to do so because his wife was dying from injuries sustained in a skiing accident at the time. Georg Cantor was also instrumental in the establishment of the first International Congress of Mathematicians, which took place in Zürich, Switzerland, in 1897.

===Later years and death===
After Cantor&#x27;s 1884 hospitalization there is no record that he was in any sanatorium again until 1899. Soon after that second hospitalization, Cantor&#x27;s youngest son Rudolph died suddenly on 16 December (Cantor was delivering a lecture on his views on Baconian theory and William Shakespeare), and this tragedy drained Cantor of much of his passion for mathematics. Cantor was again hospitalized in 1903. One year later, he was outraged and agitated by a paper presented by Julius König at the Third International Congress of Mathematicians. The paper attempted to prove that the basic tenets of transfinite set theory were false. Since the paper had been read in front of his daughters and colleagues, Cantor perceived himself as having been publicly humiliated. Although Ernst Zermelo demonstrated less than a day later that König&#x27;s proof had failed, Cantor remained shaken, and momentarily questioning God. Cantor suffered from chronic depression for the rest of his life, for which he was excused from teaching on several occasions and repeatedly confined to various sanatoria. The events of 1904 preceded a series of hospitalizations at intervals of two or three years. He did not abandon mathematics completely, however, lecturing on the paradoxes of set theory (Burali-Forti paradox, Cantor&#x27;s paradox, and Russell&#x27;s paradox) to a meeting of the &quot;Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung&quot; in 1903, and attending the International Congress of Mathematicians at Heidelberg in 1904.

In 1911, Cantor was one of the distinguished foreign scholars invited to the 500th anniversary of the founding of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Cantor attended, hoping to meet Bertrand Russell, whose newly published &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; repeatedly cited Cantor&#x27;s work, but the encounter did not come about. The following year, St. Andrews awarded Cantor an honorary doctorate, but illness precluded his receiving the degree in person.

Cantor retired in 1913, and lived in poverty and suffered from malnourishment during World War I. The public celebration of his 70th birthday was canceled because of the war. In June 1917, he entered a sanatorium for the last time and continually wrote to his wife asking to be allowed to go home. Georg Cantor had a fatal heart attack on 6 January 1918, in the sanatorium where he had spent the last year of his life.

==Mathematical work==
Cantor&#x27;s work between 1874 and 1884 is the origin of set theory. Prior to this work, the concept of a set was a rather elementary one that had been used implicitly since the beginning of mathematics, dating back to the ideas of Aristotle. No one had realized that set theory had any nontrivial content. Before Cantor, there were only finite sets (which are easy to understand) and &quot;the infinite&quot; (which was considered a topic for philosophical, rather than mathematical, discussion). By proving that there are (infinitely) many possible sizes for infinite sets, Cantor established that set theory was not trivial, and it needed to be studied. Set theory has come to play the role of a foundational theory in modern mathematics, in the sense that it interprets propositions about mathematical objects (for example, numbers and functions) from all the traditional areas of mathematics (such as algebra, analysis, and topology) in a single theory, and provides a standard set of axioms to prove or disprove them. The basic concepts of set theory are now used throughout mathematics.

In one of his earliest papers, Cantor proved that the set of real numbers is &quot;more numerous&quot; than the set of natural numbers; this showed, for the first time, that there exist infinite sets of different sizes. He was also the first to appreciate the importance of one-to-one correspondences (hereinafter denoted &quot;1-to-1 correspondence&quot;) in set theory. He used this concept to define finite and infinite sets, subdividing the latter into denumerable (or countably infinite) sets and nondenumerable sets (uncountably infinite sets).

Cantor developed important concepts in topology and their relation to cardinality. For example, he showed that the Cantor set, discovered by Henry John Stephen Smith in 1875, is nowhere dense, but has the same cardinality as the set of all real numbers, whereas the rationals are everywhere dense, but countable. He also showed that all countable dense linear orders without end points are order-isomorphic to the rational numbers.

Cantor introduced fundamental constructions in set theory, such as the power set of a set &quot;A&quot;, which is the set of all possible subsets of &quot;A&quot;. He later proved that the size of the power set of &quot;A&quot; is strictly larger than the size of &quot;A&quot;, even when &quot;A&quot; is an infinite set; this result soon became known as Cantor&#x27;s theorem. Cantor developed an entire theory and arithmetic of infinite sets, called cardinals and ordinals, which extended the arithmetic of the natural numbers. His notation for the cardinal numbers was the Hebrew letter formula_1 (ℵ, aleph) with a natural number subscript; for the ordinals he employed the Greek letter formula_2 (, omega). This notation is still in use today.

The &quot;Continuum hypothesis&quot;, introduced by Cantor, was presented by David Hilbert as the first of his twenty-three open problems in his address at the 1900 International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris. Cantor&#x27;s work also attracted favorable notice beyond Hilbert&#x27;s celebrated encomium. The US philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce praised Cantor&#x27;s set theory and, following public lectures delivered by Cantor at the first International Congress of Mathematicians, held in Zürich in 1897, Adolf Hurwitz and Jacques Hadamard also both expressed their admiration. At that Congress, Cantor renewed his friendship and correspondence with Dedekind. From 1905, Cantor corresponded with his British admirer and translator Philip Jourdain on the history of set theory and on Cantor&#x27;s religious ideas. This was later published, as were several of his expository works.

===Number theory, trigonometric series and ordinals===
Cantor&#x27;s first ten papers were on number theory, his thesis topic. At the suggestion of Eduard Heine, the Professor at Halle, Cantor turned to analysis. Heine proposed that Cantor solve an open problem that had eluded Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Rudolf Lipschitz, Bernhard Riemann, and Heine himself: the uniqueness of the representation of a function by trigonometric series. Cantor solved this problem in 1869. It was while working on this problem that he discovered transfinite ordinals, which occurred as indices &quot;n&quot; in the &quot;n&quot;th derived set &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; of a set &quot;S&quot; of zeros of a trigonometric series. Given a trigonometric series f(x) with &quot;S&quot; as its set of zeros, Cantor had discovered a procedure that produced another trigonometric series that had &quot;S&quot;1 as its set of zeros, where &quot;S&quot;1 is the set of limit points of &quot;S&quot;. If &quot;S&quot;&quot;k+1&quot; is the set of limit points of &quot;S&quot;&quot;k&quot;, then he could construct a trigonometric series whose zeros are &quot;S&quot;&quot;k+1&quot;. Because the sets &quot;S&quot;&quot;k&quot; were closed, they contained their limit points, and the intersection of the infinite decreasing sequence of sets &quot;S&quot;, &quot;S&quot;1, &quot;S&quot;2, &quot;S&quot;3... formed a limit set, which we would now call &quot;S&quot;&quot;ω&quot;, and then he noticed that &quot;S&quot;ω would also have to have a set of limit points &quot;S&quot;ω+1, and so on. He had examples that went on forever, and so here was a naturally occurring infinite sequence of infinite numbers &quot;ω&quot;, &quot;ω&quot; + 1, &quot;ω&quot; + 2, ...

Between 1870 and 1872, Cantor published more papers on trigonometric series, and also a paper defining irrational numbers as convergent sequences of rational numbers. Dedekind, whom Cantor befriended in 1872, cited this paper later that year, in the paper where he first set out his celebrated definition of real numbers by Dedekind cuts. While extending the notion of number by means of his revolutionary concept of infinite cardinality, Cantor was paradoxically opposed to theories of infinitesimals of his contemporaries Otto Stolz and Paul du Bois-Reymond, describing them as both &quot;an abomination&quot; and &quot;a cholera bacillus of mathematics&quot;. Cantor also published an erroneous &quot;proof&quot; of the inconsistency of infinitesimals.

===Set theory===

The beginning of set theory as a branch of mathematics is often marked by the publication of Cantor&#x27;s 1874 paper, &quot;Ueber eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen&quot; (&quot;On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers&quot;). This paper was the first to provide a rigorous proof that there was more than one kind of infinity. Previously, all infinite collections had been implicitly assumed to be equinumerous (that is, of &quot;the same size&quot; or having the same number of elements). Cantor proved that the collection of real numbers and the collection of positive integers are not equinumerous. In other words, the real numbers are not countable. His proof differs from the diagonal argument that he gave in 1891. Cantor&#x27;s article also contains a new method of constructing transcendental numbers. Transcendental numbers were first constructed by Joseph Liouville in 1844.

Cantor established these results using two constructions. His first construction shows how to write the real algebraic numbers as a sequence &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, &quot;a&quot;3, ... In other words, the real algebraic numbers are countable. Cantor starts his second construction with any sequence of real numbers. Using this sequence, he constructs nested intervals whose intersection contains a real number not in the sequence. Since every sequence of real numbers can be used to construct a real not in the sequence, the real numbers cannot be written as a sequence – that is, the real numbers are not countable. By applying his construction to the sequence of real algebraic numbers, Cantor produces a transcendental number. Cantor points out that his constructions prove more – namely, they provide a new proof of Liouville&#x27;s theorem: Every interval contains infinitely many transcendental numbers. Cantor&#x27;s next article contains a construction that proves the set of transcendental numbers has the same &quot;power&quot; (see below) as the set of real numbers.

Between 1879 and 1884, Cantor published a series of six articles in &quot;Mathematische Annalen&quot; that together formed an introduction to his set theory. At the same time, there was growing opposition to Cantor&#x27;s ideas, led by Leopold Kronecker, who admitted mathematical concepts only if they could be constructed in a finite number of steps from the natural numbers, which he took as intuitively given. For Kronecker, Cantor&#x27;s hierarchy of infinities was inadmissible, since accepting the concept of actual infinity would open the door to paradoxes which would challenge the validity of mathematics as a whole. Cantor also introduced the Cantor set during this period.

The fifth paper in this series, &quot;Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre&quot; (&quot;Foundations of a General Theory of Aggregates&quot;), published in 1883, was the most important of the six and was also published as a separate monograph. It contained Cantor&#x27;s reply to his critics and showed how the transfinite numbers were a systematic extension of the natural numbers. It begins by defining well-ordered sets. Ordinal numbers are then introduced as the order types of well-ordered sets. Cantor then defines the addition and multiplication of the cardinal and ordinal numbers. In 1885, Cantor extended his theory of order types so that the ordinal numbers simply became a special case of order types.

In 1891, he published a paper containing his elegant &quot;diagonal argument&quot; for the existence of an uncountable set. He applied the same idea to prove Cantor&#x27;s theorem: the cardinality of the power set of a set &quot;A&quot; is strictly larger than the cardinality of &quot;A&quot;. This established the richness of the hierarchy of infinite sets, and of the cardinal and ordinal arithmetic that Cantor had defined. His argument is fundamental in the solution of the Halting problem and the proof of Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem. Cantor wrote on the Goldbach conjecture in 1894.
In 1895 and 1897, Cantor published a two-part paper in &quot;Mathematische Annalen&quot; under Felix Klein&#x27;s editorship; these were his last significant papers on set theory. The first paper begins by defining set, subset, etc., in ways that would be largely acceptable now. The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed. Cantor wanted the second paper to include a proof of the continuum hypothesis, but had to settle for expositing his theory of well-ordered sets and ordinal numbers. Cantor attempts to prove that if &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are sets with &quot;A&quot; equivalent to a subset of &quot;B&quot; and &quot;B&quot; equivalent to a subset of &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are equivalent. Ernst Schröder had stated this theorem a bit earlier, but his proof, as well as Cantor&#x27;s, was flawed. Felix Bernstein supplied a correct proof in his 1898 PhD thesis; hence the name Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem.

====One-to-one correspondence====
Cantor&#x27;s 1874 Crelle paper was the first to invoke the notion of a 1-to-1 correspondence, though he did not use that phrase. He then began looking for a 1-to-1 correspondence between the points of the unit square and the points of a unit line segment. In an 1877 letter to Richard Dedekind, Cantor proved a far stronger result: for any positive integer &quot;n&quot;, there exists a 1-to-1 correspondence between the points on the unit line segment and all of the points in an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space. About this discovery Cantor wrote to Dedekind: &quot;&quot; (&quot;I see it, but I don&#x27;t believe it!&quot;) The result that he found so astonishing has implications for geometry and the notion of dimension.

In 1878, Cantor submitted another paper to Crelle&#x27;s Journal, in which he defined precisely the concept of a 1-to-1 correspondence and introduced the notion of &quot;power&quot; (a term he took from Jakob Steiner) or &quot;equivalence&quot; of sets: two sets are equivalent (have the same power) if there exists a 1-to-1 correspondence between them. Cantor defined countable sets (or denumerable sets) as sets which can be put into a 1-to-1 correspondence with the natural numbers, and proved that the rational numbers are denumerable. He also proved that &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space R&quot;n&quot; has the same power as the real numbers R, as does a countably infinite product of copies of R. While he made free use of countability as a concept, he did not write the word &quot;countable&quot; until 1883. Cantor also discussed his thinking about dimension, stressing that his mapping between the unit interval and the unit square was not a continuous one.

This paper displeased Kronecker and Cantor wanted to withdraw it; however, Dedekind persuaded him not to do so and Karl Weierstrass supported its publication. Nevertheless, Cantor never again submitted anything to Crelle.

====Continuum hypothesis====

Cantor was the first to formulate what later came to be known as the continuum hypothesis or CH: there exists no set whose power is greater than that of the naturals and less than that of the reals (or equivalently, the cardinality of the reals is &quot;exactly&quot; aleph-one, rather than just &quot;at least&quot; aleph-one). Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain. His inability to prove the continuum hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety.

The difficulty Cantor had in proving the continuum hypothesis has been underscored by later developments in the field of mathematics: a 1940 result by Kurt Gödel and a 1963 one by Paul Cohen together imply that the continuum hypothesis can be neither proved nor disproved using standard Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory plus the axiom of choice (the combination referred to as &quot;ZFC&quot;).

====Absolute infinite, well-ordering theorem, and paradoxes====
In 1883, Cantor divided the infinite into the transfinite and the absolute.

The transfinite is increasable in magnitude, while the absolute is unincreasable. For example, an ordinal α is transfinite because it can be increased to α + 1. On the other hand, the ordinals form an absolutely infinite sequence that cannot be increased in magnitude because there are no larger ordinals to add to it. In 1883, Cantor also introduced the well-ordering principle &quot;every set can be well-ordered&quot; and stated that it is a &quot;law of thought&quot;.

Cantor extended his work on the absolute infinite by using it in a proof. Around 1895, he began to regard his well-ordering principle as a theorem and attempted to prove it. In 1899, he sent Dedekind a proof of the equivalent aleph theorem: the cardinality of every infinite set is an aleph. First, he defined two types of multiplicities: consistent multiplicities (sets) and inconsistent multiplicities (absolutely infinite multiplicities). Next he assumed that the ordinals form a set, proved that this leads to a contradiction, and concluded that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. He used this inconsistent multiplicity to prove the aleph theorem. In 1932, Zermelo criticized the construction in Cantor&#x27;s proof.

Cantor avoided paradoxes by recognizing that there are two types of multiplicities. In his set theory, when it is assumed that the ordinals form a set, the resulting contradiction implies only that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. In contrast, Bertrand Russell treated all collections as sets, which leads to paradoxes. In Russell&#x27;s set theory, the ordinals form a set, so the resulting contradiction implies that the theory is inconsistent. From 1901 to 1903, Russell discovered three paradoxes implying that his set theory is inconsistent: the Burali-Forti paradox (which was just mentioned), Cantor&#x27;s paradox, and Russell&#x27;s paradox. Russell named paradoxes after Cesare Burali-Forti and Cantor even though neither of them believed that they had found paradoxes.

In 1908, Zermelo published his axiom system for set theory. He had two motivations for developing the axiom system: eliminating the paradoxes and securing his proof of the well-ordering theorem. Zermelo had proved this theorem in 1904 using the axiom of choice, but his proof was criticized for a variety of reasons. His response to the criticism included his axiom system and a new proof of the well-ordering theorem. His axioms support this new proof, and they eliminate the paradoxes by restricting the formation of sets.

In 1923, John von Neumann developed an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes by using an approach similar to Cantor&#x27;s—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a class is too big to be a set if it can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the class of all sets. He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the class of all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class. Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the class of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the class of all sets. This correspondence well-orders the class of all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann&#x27;s axiom.

==Philosophy, religion, literature and Cantor&#x27;s mathematics==
The concept of the existence of an actual infinity was an important shared concern within the realms of mathematics, philosophy and religion. Preserving the orthodoxy of the relationship between God and mathematics, although not in the same form as held by his critics, was long a concern of Cantor&#x27;s. He directly addressed this intersection between these disciplines in the introduction to his &quot;Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre&quot;, where he stressed the connection between his view of the infinite and the philosophical one. To Cantor, his mathematical views were intrinsically linked to their philosophical and theological implications – he identified the absolute infinite with God, and he considered his work on transfinite numbers to have been directly communicated to him by God, who had chosen Cantor to reveal them to the world. He was a devout Lutheran whose explicit Christian beliefs shaped his philosophy of science. Joseph Dauben has traced the effect Cantor&#x27;s Christian convictions had on the development of transfinite set theory.

Debate among mathematicians grew out of opposing views in the philosophy of mathematics regarding the nature of actual infinity. Some held to the view that infinity was an abstraction which was not mathematically legitimate, and denied its existence. Mathematicians from three major schools of thought (constructivism and its two offshoots, intuitionism and finitism) opposed Cantor&#x27;s theories in this matter. For constructivists such as Kronecker, this rejection of actual infinity stems from fundamental disagreement with the idea that nonconstructive proofs such as Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument are sufficient proof that something exists, holding instead that constructive proofs are required. Intuitionism also rejects the idea that actual infinity is an expression of any sort of reality, but arrive at the decision via a different route than constructivism. Firstly, Cantor&#x27;s argument rests on logic to prove the existence of transfinite numbers as an actual mathematical entity, whereas intuitionists hold that mathematical entities cannot be reduced to logical propositions, originating instead in the intuitions of the mind. Secondly, the notion of infinity as an expression of reality is itself disallowed in intuitionism, since the human mind cannot intuitively construct an infinite set. Mathematicians such as L. E. J. Brouwer and especially Henri Poincaré adopted an intuitionist stance against Cantor&#x27;s work. Finally, Wittgenstein&#x27;s attacks were finitist: he believed that Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument conflated the intension of a set of cardinal or real numbers with its extension, thus conflating the concept of rules for generating a set with an actual set.

Some Christian theologians saw Cantor&#x27;s work as a challenge to the uniqueness of the absolute infinity in the nature of God. In particular, neo-Thomist thinkers saw the existence of an actual infinity that consisted of something other than God as jeopardizing &quot;God&#x27;s exclusive claim to supreme infinity&quot;. Cantor strongly believed that this view was a misinterpretation of infinity, and was convinced that set theory could help correct this mistake: &quot;... the transfinite species are just as much at the disposal of the intentions of the Creator and His absolute boundless will as are the finite numbers.&quot;. Prominent neo-scholastic German philosopher Constantin Gutberlet was in favor of such theory, holding that it didn&#x27;t oppose the nature of God.

Cantor also believed that his theory of transfinite numbers ran counter to both materialism and determinism – and was shocked when he realized that he was the only faculty member at Halle who did &quot;not&quot; hold to deterministic philosophical beliefs.

It was important to Cantor that his philosophy provided an &quot;organic explanation&quot; of nature, and in his 1883 &quot;Grundlagen&quot;, he said that such an explanation could only come about by drawing on the resources of the philosophy of Spinoza and Leibniz. In making these claims, Cantor may have been influenced by F. A. Trendelenburg, whose lecture courses he attended at Berlin, and in turn Cantor produced a Latin commentary on Book 1 of Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;Ethica&quot;. Trendelenburg was also the examiner of Cantor&#x27;s &quot;Habilitationsschrift&quot;.

In 1888, Cantor published his correspondence with several philosophers on the philosophical implications of his set theory. In an extensive attempt to persuade other Christian thinkers and authorities to adopt his views, Cantor had corresponded with Christian philosophers such as Tilman Pesch and Joseph Hontheim, as well as theologians such as Cardinal Johann Baptist Franzelin, who once replied by equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism. Although later this Cardinal accepted the theory as valid, due to some clarifications from Cantor&#x27;s. Cantor even sent one letter directly to Pope Leo XIII himself, and addressed several pamphlets to him.

Cantor&#x27;s philosophy on the nature of numbers led him to affirm a belief in the freedom of mathematics to posit and prove concepts apart from the realm of physical phenomena, as expressions within an internal reality. The only restrictions on this metaphysical system are that all mathematical concepts must be devoid of internal contradiction, and that they follow from existing definitions, axioms, and theorems. This belief is summarized in his assertion that &quot;the essence of mathematics is its freedom.&quot; These ideas parallel those of Edmund Husserl, whom Cantor had met in Halle.

Meanwhile, Cantor himself was fiercely opposed to infinitesimals, describing them as both an &quot;abomination&quot; and &quot;the cholera bacillus of mathematics&quot;.

Cantor&#x27;s 1883 paper reveals that he was well aware of the opposition his ideas were encountering: &quot;... I realize that in this undertaking I place myself in a certain opposition to views widely held concerning the mathematical infinite and to opinions frequently defended on the nature of numbers.&quot;

Hence he devotes much space to justifying his earlier work, asserting that mathematical concepts may be freely introduced as long as they are free of contradiction and defined in terms of previously accepted concepts. He also cites Aristotle, René Descartes, George Berkeley, Gottfried Leibniz, and Bernard Bolzano on infinity. Instead, he always strongly rejected Immanuel Kant&#x27;s philosophy, in the realms of both the philosophy of mathematics and metaphysics. He shared B. Russell&#x27;s motto &quot;Kant or Cantor&quot;, and defined Kant &quot;yonder sophistical Philistine who knew so little mathematics.&quot;

==Cantor&#x27;s ancestry==

Cantor&#x27;s paternal grandparents were from Copenhagen and fled to Russia from the disruption of the Napoleonic Wars. There is very little direct information on them. Cantor&#x27;s father, Georg Waldemar Cantor, was educated in the Lutheran mission in Saint Petersburg, and his correspondence with his son shows both of them as devout Lutherans. Very little is known for sure about Georg Waldemar&#x27;s origin or education. Cantor&#x27;s mother, Maria Anna Böhm, was an Austro-Hungarian born in Saint Petersburg and baptized Roman Catholic; she converted to Protestantism upon marriage. However, there is a letter from Cantor&#x27;s brother Louis to their mother, stating:
which could be read to imply that she was of Jewish ancestry.

According to biographer Eric Temple Bell, Cantor was of Jewish descent, although both parents were baptized. In a 1971 article entitled &quot;Towards a Biography of Georg Cantor&quot;, the British historian of mathematics Ivor Grattan-Guinness mentions (Annals of Science 27, pp. 345–391, 1971) that he was unable to find evidence of Jewish ancestry. (He also states that Cantor&#x27;s wife, Vally Guttmann, was Jewish).

In a letter written to Paul Tannery in 1896 (Paul Tannery, Memoires Scientifique 13 Correspondence, Gauthier-Villars, Paris, 1934, p. 306), Cantor states that his paternal grandparents were members of the Sephardic Jewish community of Copenhagen. Specifically, Cantor states in describing his father: &quot;Er ist aber in Kopenhagen geboren, von israelitischen Eltern, die der dortigen portugisischen Judengemeinde...&quot; (&quot;He was born in Copenhagen of Jewish (lit: &#x27;Israelite&#x27;) parents from the local Portuguese-Jewish community.&quot;)
In addition, Cantor&#x27;s maternal great uncle, Josef Böhm, a Hungarian violinist, has been described as Jewish, which may imply that Cantor&#x27;s mother was at least partly descended from the Hungarian Jewish community.

In a letter to Bertrand Russell, Cantor described his ancestry and self-perception as follows:
There were documented statements, during the 1930s, that called this Jewish ancestry into question:
==Biographies==
Until the 1970s, the chief academic publications on Cantor were two short monographs by Arthur Moritz Schönflies (1927) – largely the correspondence with Mittag-Leffler – and Fraenkel (1930). Both were at second and third hand; neither had much on his personal life. The gap was largely filled by Eric Temple Bell&#x27;s &quot;Men of Mathematics&quot; (1937), which one of Cantor&#x27;s modern biographers describes as &quot;perhaps the most widely read modern book on the history of mathematics&quot;; and as &quot;one of the worst&quot;. Bell presents Cantor&#x27;s relationship with his father as Oedipal, Cantor&#x27;s differences with Kronecker as a quarrel between two Jews, and Cantor&#x27;s madness as Romantic despair over his failure to win acceptance for his mathematics. Grattan-Guinness (1971) found that none of these claims were true, but they may be found in many books of the intervening period, owing to the absence of any other narrative. There are other legends, independent of Bell – including one that labels Cantor&#x27;s father a foundling, shipped to Saint Petersburg by unknown parents. A critique of Bell&#x27;s book is contained in Joseph Dauben&#x27;s biography. Writes Dauben:

Over the course of time, it has merged with a number of previously independent higher education institutions in the city and has continuously expanded its study profile. It was granted the rights of a full university by the Swedish Government in 1954, following the merger of the &quot;Göteborgs högskola&quot; (Gothenburg College) with the &quot;Medicinhögskolan i Göteborg&quot; (Gothenburg Medical School).

The University of Gothenburg is a pronounced city university, that is most of its facilities are within the city centre of Gothenburg. The main building as well as most faculties are located in the central part of Gothenburg.

Together with Uppsala, Lund, and Stockholm universities, it is one of four large international research universities in Sweden.

<text>A film genre is a stylistic or thematic category for motion pictures based on similarities either in the narrative elements, aesthetic approach, or the emotional response to the film.

Drawing heavily from the theories of literary-genre criticism, film genres are usually delineated by &quot;conventions, iconography, settings, narratives, characters and actors&quot;. One can also classify films by the tone, theme/topic, mood, format, target audience, or budget. These characteristics are most evident in genre films, which are &quot;commercial feature films [that], through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations&quot; in a given genre.

A film&#x27;s genre will influence the use of filmmaking styles and techniques, such as the use of flashbacks and low-key lighting in film noir; tight framing in horror films; or fonts that look like rough-hewn logs for the titles of Western films. In addition, genres have associated film scoring conventions, such as lush string orchestras for romantic melodramas or electronic music for science fiction films. Genre also affects how films are broadcast on television, advertised, and organized in video rental stores.

Alan Williams distinguishes three main genre categories: narrative, avant-garde, and documentary.

With the proliferation of particular genres, film subgenres can also emerge: the legal drama, for example, is a sub-genre of drama that includes courtroom- and trial-focused films. Subgenres are often a mixture of two separate genres; genres can also merge with seemingly unrelated ones to form hybrid genres, where popular combinations include the romantic comedy and the action comedy film. Broader examples include the docufiction and docudrama, which merge the basic categories of fiction and non-fiction (documentary).

Genres are not fixed; they change and evolve over time, and some genres may largely disappear (for example, the melodrama). Not only does &quot;genre&quot; refer to a type of film or its category, a key role is also played by the expectations of an audience about a film, as well as institutional discourses that create generic structures.

==Overview==
=== Characteristics ===
Characteristics of particular genres are most evident in genre films, which are &quot;commercial feature films [that], through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations&quot; in a given genre.

Drawing heavily from the theories of literary-genre criticism, film genres are usually delineated by conventions, iconography, narratives, formats, characters, and actors, all of which can vary according to the genre. In terms of standard or &quot;stock&quot; characters, those in film noir, for example, include the femme fatale and the &quot;hardboiled&quot; detective; while those in Westerns, stock characters include the schoolmarm and the gunslinger. Regarding actors, some may acquire a reputation linked to a single genre, such as John Wayne (the Western) or Fred Astaire (the musical). Some genres have been characterized or known to use particular formats, which refers to the way in which films are shot (e.g., 35 mm, 16 mm or 8 mm) or the manner of presentation (e.g., anamorphic widescreen).

Genres can also be classified by more inherent characteristics (usually implied in their names), such as settings, theme/topic, mood, target audience, or budget/type of production.

* The setting is the environment—including both time and geographic location—in which the story and action take place (e.g., present day or historical period; Earth or outer-space; urban or rural, etc.). Genres that are particularly concerned with this element include the historical drama, war film, Western, and space-opera, the names of which all denote particular settings.
* The theme or topic refers to the issues or concepts that the film revolves around; for example, the science fiction film, sports film, and crime film.
* The mood is the emotional tone of the film, as implied in the names of the comedy film, horror film, or &#x27;tearjerker&#x27;.
* Genres informed by particular target audience(s) include children&#x27;s film, teen film, woman&#x27;s film, and &quot;chick flick&quot;.
* Genres characterized by the type of production include the blockbuster, independent film, and low-budget film, such as the B movie (commercial) or amateur film (noncommercial).

Screenwriters, in particular, often organize their stories by genre, focusing their attention on three specific aspects: atmosphere, character, and story. A film&#x27;s atmosphere includes costumes, props, locations, and the visceral experiences created for the audience. Aspects of character include archetypes, stock characters, and the goals and motivations of the central characters. Some story considerations for screenwriters, as they relate to genre, include theme, tent-pole scenes, and how the rhythm of characters&#x27; perspective shift from scene to scene.

== Examples of genres and subgenres ==
==History==
From the earliest days of cinema in the 19th century the term &quot;genre&quot; (already in use in English with reference to works of art or literary production from at least 1770) was used to organize films according to type.
By the 1950s André Bazin was discussing the concept of &quot;genre&quot; by using the Western film as an example; during this era, there was a debate over auteur theory versus genre. In the late 1960s the concept of genre became a significant part of film theory.

Film genres draw on genres from other forms; Western novels existed before the Western film, and musical theatre pre-dated film musicals. The perceived genre of a film can change over time; for example, in the 21st century &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (1903) classes as a key early Western film, but when released, marketing promoted it &quot;for its relation to the then-popular genres of the chase film, the railroad film and the crime film&quot;.
A key reason that the early Hollywood industrial system from the 1920s to the 1950s favoured genre films is that in &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s industrial mode of production, genre movies are dependable products&quot; to market to audiences – they were easy to produce and it was easy for audiences to understand a genre film. In the 1920s to 1950s, genre films had clear conventions and iconography, such as the heavy coats worn by gangsters in films like &quot;Little Caesar&quot; (1931).
The conventions in genre films enable filmmakers to generate them in an industrial, assembly-line fashion, an approach which can be seen in the James Bond spy-films, which all use a formula of &quot;lots of action, fancy gadgets, beautiful woman and colourful villains&quot;, even though the actors, directors and screenwriters change.

==Pure and hybrid genres==
Films are rarely purely from one genre, which is in keeping with the cinema&#x27;s diverse and derivative origins, it being a blend of &quot;vaudeville, music-hall, theatre, photography&quot; and novels. American film historian Janet Staiger states that the genre of a film can be defined in four ways. The &quot;idealist method&quot; judges films by predetermined standards. The &quot;empirical method&quot; identifies the genre of a film by comparing it to a list of films already deemed to fall within a certain genre. The &quot;a priori&quot; method uses common generic elements which are identified in advance. The &quot;social conventions&quot; method of identifying the genre of a film is based on the accepted cultural consensus within society. Martin Loop contends that Hollywood films are not pure genres because most Hollywood movies blend the love-oriented plot of the romance genre with other genres. Jim Colins claims that since the 1980s, Hollywood films have been influenced by the trend towards &quot;ironic hybridization&quot;, in which directors combine elements from different genres, as with the Western/science fiction mix in &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot;.

Many films cross into multiple genres. Susan Hayward states that spy films often cross genre boundaries with thriller films. Some genre films take genre elements from one genre and place them into the conventions of a second genre, such as with &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953), which adds film noir and detective film elements into &quot;The Girl Hunt&quot; ballet. In the 1970s New Hollywood era, there was so much parodying of genres that it can be hard to assign genres to some films from this era, such as Mel Brooks&#x27; comedy-Western &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974) or the private eye parody &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1973). Other films from this era bend genres so much that it is challenging to put them in a genre category, such as Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974) and William Friedkin&#x27;s &quot;The French Connection&quot; (1971).

Film theorist Robert Stam challenged whether genres really exist, or whether they are merely made up by critics. Stam has questioned whether &quot;genres [are] really &#x27;out there&#x27; in the world or are they really the construction of analysts?&quot;. As well, he has asked whether there is a &quot;... finite taxonomy of genres or are they in principle infinite?&quot; and whether genres are &quot;...timeless essences ephemeral, time-bound entities? Are genres culture-bound or trans-cultural?&quot;. Stam has also asked whether genre analysis should aim at being descriptive or prescriptive. While some genres are based on story content (the war film), other are borrowed from literature (comedy, melodrama) or from other media (the musical). Some are performer-based (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films) or budget-based (blockbusters, low-budget film), while others are based on artistic status (the art film), racial identity (race films), location (the Western), or sexual orientation (&quot;New Queer Cinema&quot;).

== Audience expectations ==
Many genres have built-in audiences and corresponding publications that support them, such as magazines and websites. For example, horror films have a well-established fanbase that reads horror magazines such as &quot;Fangoria&quot;. Films that are difficult to categorize into a genre are often less successful. As such, film genres are also useful in the areas of marketing, film criticism and the analysis of consumption. Hollywood story consultant John Truby states that &quot;...you have to know how to transcend the forms [genres] so you can give the audience a sense of originality and surprise&quot;.

Some screenwriters use genre as a means of determining what kind of plot or content to put into a screenplay. They may study films of specific genres to find examples. This is a way that some screenwriters are able to copy elements of successful movies and pass them off in a new screenplay. It is likely that such screenplays fall short in originality. As Truby says, &quot;Writers know enough to write a genre script but they haven&#x27;t twisted the story beats of that genre in such a way that it gives an original face to it&quot;.

Cinema technologies are associated with genres. Huge widescreens helped Western films to create an expansive setting of the open plains and desert. Science fiction and fantasy films are associated with special effects, notably computer generated imagery (e.g., the Harry Potter films).

In 2017, screenwriter Eric R. Williams published a system for screenwriters to conceptualize narrative film genres based on audience expectations. The system was based upon the structure biologists use to analyze living beings. Williams wrote a companion book detailing his taxonomy, which claims to be able to identify all feature length narrative films with seven categorizations: film type, super genre, macro-genre, micro-genre, voice, and pathway.

==Categorization==

Because genres are easier to recognize than to define, academics agree they cannot be identified in a rigid way. Furthermore, different countries and cultures define genres in different ways. A typical example are war movies. In United States, they are mostly related to ones with large U.S. involvement such as World wars and Vietnam, whereas in other countries, movies related to wars in other historical periods are considered &quot;war movies&quot;.

Film genres may appear to be readily categorizable from the setting of the film. Nevertheless, films with the same settings can be very different, due to the use of different themes or moods. For example, while both &quot;The Battle of Midway&quot; and &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; are set in a wartime context and might be classified as belonging to the war film genre, the first examines the themes of honor, sacrifice, and valour, and the second is an anti-war film which emphasizes the pain and horror of war. While there is an argument that film noir movies could be deemed to be set in an urban setting, in cheap hotels and underworld bars, many classic noirs take place mainly in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road.

The editors of filmsite.org argue that animation, pornographic film, documentary film, silent film and so on are non-genre-based film categories.

Linda Williams argues that horror, melodrama, and pornography all fall into the category of &quot;body genres&quot; since they are each designed to elicit physical reactions on the part of viewers. Horror is designed to elicit spine-chilling, white-knuckled, eye-bulging terror; melodramas are designed to make viewers cry after seeing the misfortunes of the onscreen characters; and pornography is designed to elicit sexual arousal. This approach can be extended: comedies make people laugh, tear-jerkers make people cry, feel-good films lift people&#x27;s spirits and inspiration films provide hope for viewers.

Eric R. Williams (no relation to Linda Williams) argues that all narrative feature-length films can be categorized as one of eleven &quot;super genres&quot; (action, crime, fantasy, horror, romance, science fiction, slice of life, sports, thriller, war and Western). Williams contends that labels such as comedy or drama are more broad than the category of super genre, and therefore fall into a category he calls &quot;film type&quot;. Similarly, Williams explains that labels such as animation and musical are more specific to storytelling technique and therefore fall into his category of &quot;voice&quot;. For example, according to Williams, a film like &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; could be categorized as a comedy (type) Western (super-genre) musical (voice), while &quot;Anomalisa&quot; is a drama (type) Slice of Life (super-genre) animation (voice). Williams has created a seven-tiered categorization for narrative feature films called the Screenwriters Taxonomy.

A genre movie is a film that follows some or all of the conventions of a particular genre, whether or not it was intentional when the movie was produced.

==Film in the context of history==
In order to understand the creation and context of each film genre, we must look at its popularity in the context of its place in history. For example, the 1970s Blaxploitation films have been called an attempt to &quot;undermine the rise of Afro-American&#x27;s Black consciousness movement&quot; of that era. In William Park&#x27;s analysis of film noir, he states that we must view and interpret film for its message with the context of history within our minds; he states that this is how film can truly be understood by its audience. Film genres such as film noir and Western film reflect values of the time period. While film noir combines German expressionist filming strategies with post World War II ideals; Western films focused on the ideal of the early 20th century. Films such as the musical were created as a form of entertainment during the Great Depression allowing its viewers an escape during tough times. So when watching and analyzing film genres we must remember to remember its true intentions aside from its entertainment value.

Over time, a genre can change through stages: the classic genre era; the parody of the classics; the period where filmmakers deny that their films are part of a certain genre; and finally a critique of the entire genre. This pattern can be seen with the Western film. In the earliest, classic Westerns, there was a clear hero who protected society from lawless villains who lived in the wilderness and came into civilization to commit crimes. However, in revisionist Westerns of the 1970s, the protagonist becomes an antihero who lives in the wilderness to get away from a civilization that is depicted as corrupt, with the villains now integrated into society. Another example of a genre changing over time is the popularity of the neo-noir films in the early 2000s (&quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; (2001), &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; (2001) and &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; (2002); are these film noir parodies, a repetition of noir genre tropes, or a re-examination of the noir genre?

This is also important to remember when looking at films in the future. As viewers watch a film they are conscious of societal influence with the film itself. In order to understand its true intentions, we must identify its intended audience and what narrative of our current society, as well as it comments to the past in relation with today&#x27;s society. This enables viewers to understand the evolution of film genres as time and history morphs or views and ideals of the entertainment industry.

<doc id="12223" wikidata="Q3526892" url="?curid=12223" title="Great man theory">
<text>The great man theory is an approach to the study of history popularised in the 19th century according to which history can be largely explained by the impact of &quot;great men&quot;, or heroes: highly influential and unique individuals who, due to their natural attributes, such as superior intellect, heroic courage, extraordinary leadership abilities, or divine inspiration, have a decisive historical effect. The theory is primarily attributed to the Scottish essayist, historian, and philosopher Thomas Carlyle, who gave a series of lectures on heroism in 1840, later published as &quot;On Heroes, Hero-Worship, &amp; the Heroic in History&quot;, in which he states:

This theory is usually contrasted with &quot;history from below&quot;, which emphasizes the life of the masses creating overwhelming waves of smaller events which carry leaders along with them. Another contrasting school is historical materialism.

==Overview==

Carlyle stated that &quot;The History of the world is but the Biography of great men&quot;, reflecting his belief that heroes shape history through both their personal attributes and divine inspiration. In his book &quot;Heroes and Hero-Worship&quot;, Carlyle saw history as having turned on the decisions, works, ideas, and characters of &quot;heroes&quot;, giving detailed analysis of six types: The hero as divinity (such as Odin), prophet (such as Muhammad), poet (such as Shakespeare), priest (such as Martin Luther), man of letters (such as Rousseau), and king (such as Napoleon). Carlyle also argued that the study of great men was &quot;profitable&quot; to one&#x27;s own heroic side; that by examining the lives led by such heroes, one could not help but uncover something about one&#x27;s own true nature.

As Sidney Hook notes, a common misinterpretation of the theory is that &quot;all factors in history, save great men, were inconsequential&quot;, whereas Carlyle is instead claiming that great men are the decisive factor, owing to their unique genius. Hook then goes on to emphasize this uniqueness to illustrate the point: &quot;Genius is not the result of compounding talent. How many battalions are the equivalent of a Napoleon? How many minor poets will give us a Shakespeare? How many run of the mine scientists will do the work of an Einstein?&quot;

American scholar Frederick Adams Woods supported the great man theory in his work &quot;The Influence of Monarchs: Steps in a New Science of History&quot;. Woods investigated 386 rulers in Western Europe from the 12th century until the French Revolution in the late 18th century and their influence on the course of historical events.

The Great Man approach to history was most fashionable with professional historians in the 19th century; a popular work of this school is the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot; (1911) which contains lengthy and detailed biographies about the great men of history, but very few general or social histories. For example, all information on the post-Roman &quot;Migrations Period&quot; of European History is compiled under the biography of Attila the Hun. This heroic view of history was also strongly endorsed by some philosophers, such as Léon Bloy, Søren Kierkegaard, Oswald Spengler and Max Weber.

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, proceeding from providentialist theory, argued that &quot;what is real is reasonable&quot; and World-Historical individuals are World-Spirit&#x27;s agents. Hegel wrote: &quot;Such are great historical men—whose own particular aims involve those large issues which are the will of the World-Spirit.&quot; Thus, according to Hegel, a great man does not create historical reality himself but only uncovers the inevitable future.

In &quot;Untimely Meditations&quot;, Friedrich Nietzsche writes that &quot;the goal of humanity lies in its highest specimens&quot;. Although Nietzsche&#x27;s body of work shows some overlap with Carlyle&#x27;s line of thought, Nietzsche expressly rejected Carlyle&#x27;s hero cult in &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;. 

=== Assumptions ===
This theory rests on two main assumptions, as pointed out by Villanova University:
# Every great leader is born already possessing certain traits that will enable them to rise and lead on instinct.
# The need for them has to be great for these traits to then arise, allowing them to lead.

This theory, and history, claims these great leaders as heroes that were able to rise against the odds to defeat rivals while inspiring followers along the way. Theorists say that these leaders were then born with a specific set of traits and attributes that make them ideal candidates for leadership and roles of authority and power. This theory relies then heavily on born rather than made, nature rather than nurture and cultivates the idea that those in power deserve to lead and shouldn&#x27;t be questioned because they have the unique traits that make them suited for the position.

== Responses ==

=== Herbert Spencer&#x27;s critique ===
One of the most forceful critics of Carlyle&#x27;s formulation of the great man theory was Herbert Spencer, who believed that attributing historical events to the decisions of individuals was an unscientific position. He believed that the men Carlyle supposed &quot;great men&quot; are merely products of their social environment:

=== William James&#x27; defence ===
William James, in his 1880 lecture &quot;Great Men, Great Thoughts, and the Environment&quot;, published in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, forcefully defended Carlyle and refuted Spencer, condemning what James viewed as an &quot;impudent&quot;, &quot;vague&quot;, and &quot;dogmatic&quot; argument.

James&#x27; defence of the great man theory can be summarized as follows: The unique physiological nature of the individual is the deciding factor in making the great man, who, in turn, is the deciding factor in changing his environment in a unique way, without which the new environment would not have come to be, wherein the extent and nature of this change is also dependent on the reception of the environment to this new stimulus. To begin his argument, he first sardonically claims that these inherent physiological qualities have as much to do with &quot;social, political, geographical [and] anthropological conditions&quot; as the &quot;conditions of the crater of Vesuvius has to do with the flickering of this gas by which I write&quot;.

James argues that genetic anomalies in the brains of these &quot;great men&quot; are the decisive factor by introducing an original influence into their environment. They might therefore offer original ideas, discoveries, inventions and perspectives which &quot;would not, in the mind of another individual, have engendered just that conclusion ... It flashes out of one brain, and no other, because the instability of that brain is such as to tip and upset itself in just that particular direction.&quot;

James then argues that these spontaneous variations of genius, i.e. the &quot;great men&quot;, which are causally independent of their social environment, subsequently influence that environment which in turn will either preserve or destroy the newly encountered variations in a form of evolutionary selection. If the great man is preserved then the environment is changed by his influence in &quot;an entirely original and peculiar way. He acts as a ferment, and changes its constitution, just as the advent of a new zoological species changes the faunal and floral equilibrium of the region in which it appears.&quot; Each ferment, each great man, exerts a new influence on their environment which is either embraced or rejected and if embraced will in turn shape the crucible for the selection process of future geniuses.

In the words of William James, &quot;If we were to remove these geniuses or alter their idiosyncrasies, what increasing uniformities would the environment exhibit?&quot; James challenges Mr. Spencer or anyone else to provide a reply. According to James, there are two distinct factors driving social evolution: personal agents and the impact of their unique qualities on the overall course of events.

He thus concludes: &quot;Both factors are essential to change. The community stagnates without the impulse of the individual. The impulse dies away without the sympathy of the community.&quot;

=== Other responses ===
Before the 19th century, Blaise Pascal begins his &quot;Three Discourses on the Condition of the Great&quot; (written it seems for a young duke) by telling the story of a castaway on an island whose inhabitants take him for their missing king. He defends in his parable of the shipwrecked king, that the legitimacy of the greatness of &quot;great men&quot; is fundamentally custom and chance. A coincidence that gives birth to him in the right place with noble parents and arbitrary custom deciding, for example, on an unequal distribution of wealth in favor of the nobles.

Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; features criticism of great-man theories as a recurring theme in the philosophical digressions. According to Tolstoy, the significance of great individuals is imaginary; as a matter of fact they are only &quot;history&#x27;s slaves,&quot; realizing the decree of Providence.

Jacob Burckhardt affirmed the historical existence of great men in politics, even excusing the rarity among them to possess &quot;greatness of soul&quot;, or magnanimity: &quot;Contemporaries believe that if people will only mind their own business political morality will improve of itself and history will be purged of the crimes of the &#x27;great men.&#x27; These optimists forget that the common people too are greedy and envious and when resisted tend to turn to collective violence.&quot; Burckhardt predicted that the belittling of great men would lead to a lowering of standards and rise in mediocrity generally.

Mark Twain suggests in his essay &quot;The United States of Lyncherdom&quot; that &quot;moral cowardice&quot; is &quot;the commanding feature of the make-up of 9,999 men in the 10,000&quot; and that &quot;from the beginning of the world no revolt against a public infamy or oppression has ever been begun but by the one daring man in the 10,000, the rest timidly waiting, and slowly and reluctantly joining, under the influence of that man and his fellows from the other ten thousands.&quot;

In 1926, William Fielding Ogburn noted that Great Men history was being challenged by newer interpretations that focused on wider social forces. While not seeking to deny that individuals could have a role or show exceptional qualities, he saw Great Men as inevitable products of productive cultures. He noted for example that if Isaac Newton had not lived, calculus would have still been discovered by Gottfried Leibniz, and suspected that if neither man had lived, it would have been discovered by someone else. Among modern critics of the theory, Sidney Hook is supportive of the idea; he gives credit to those who shape events through their actions, and his book &quot;The Hero in History&quot; is devoted to the role of the hero and in history and influence of the outstanding persons.

In the introduction to a new edition of &quot;Heroes and Hero-Worship&quot;, David R. Sorensen notes the modern decline in support for Carlyle&#x27;s theory in particular but also for &quot;heroic distinction&quot; in general. He cites Robert K. Faulkner as an exception, a proponent of Aristotelian magnanimity who in his book &quot;The Case for Greatness: Honorable Ambition and Its Critics&quot;, criticizes the political bias in discussions on greatness and heroism, stating: &quot;the new liberalism’s antipathy to superior statesmen and to human excellence is peculiarly zealous, parochial, and antiphilosophic.&quot;

Ian Kershaw wrote in 1998 that &quot;The figure of Hitler, whose personal attributes – distinguished from his political aura and impact – were scarcely noble, elevating or enriching, posed self-evident problems for such a tradition.&quot; Some historians like Joachim Fest responded by arguing that Hitler had a &quot;negative greatness&quot;. By contrast, Kershaw rejects the Great Men theory and argues that it is more important to study wider political and social factors to explain the history of Nazi Germany. Kershaw argues that Hitler was an unremarkable person, but his importance came from how people viewed him, an example of Max Weber&#x27;s concept of charismatic leadership.

<doc id="12224" wikidata="Q37200" url="?curid=12224" title="Great Pyramid of Giza">
<text>The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It served as the tomb of pharaoh Khufu, who ruled during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom. Built , over a period of about 26 years, the pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only wonder that has remained largely intact. It is the most famous monument of the Giza pyramid complex, which is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Memphis and its Necropolis&quot;. It is situated at the northeastern end of the line of the three main pyramids at Giza.

Initially standing at , the Great Pyramid was the world&#x27;s tallest human-made structure for more than 3,800 years. Over time, most of the smooth white limestone casing was removed, which lowered the pyramid&#x27;s height to the current ; what is seen today is the underlying core structure. The base was measured to be about square, giving a volume of roughly , which includes an internal hillock. The dimensions of the pyramid were high, a base length of , with a &quot;seked&quot; of palms (a slope of 51°50&#x27;40&quot;).

The Great Pyramid was built by quarrying an estimated 2.3 million large blocks, weighing 6 million tonnes in total. The majority of the stones are not uniform in size or shape, and are only roughly dressed. The outside layers were bound together by mortar. Primarily local limestone from the Giza Plateau was used for its construction. Other blocks were imported by boat on the Nile: white limestone from Tura for the casing, and blocks of granite from Aswan, weighing up to 80 tonnes, for the &quot;King&#x27;s Chamber&quot; structure.

There are three known chambers inside of the Great Pyramid. The lowest was cut into the bedrock, upon which the pyramid was built, but remained unfinished. The so-called Queen&#x27;s Chamber and King&#x27;s Chamber, which contain a granite sarcophagus, are above ground, within the pyramid structure. Hemiunu, Khufu&#x27;s vizier, is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. Many varying scientific and alternative hypotheses attempt to explain the exact construction techniques, but, as is the case for other such structures, there is no definite consensus.

The funerary complex around the pyramid consisted of two mortuary temples connected by a causeway (one close to the pyramid and one near the Nile); tombs for the immediate family and court of Khufu, including three smaller pyramids for Khufu&#x27;s wives; an even smaller &quot;satellite pyramid&quot;; and five buried solar barques.

== Purpose ==
The Great Pyramid of Giza was the tomb of pharaoh Khufu, and still contains his granite sarcophagus. It had, like other tombs of Egyptian elites, four main purposes:

* It housed the body of the deceased and kept it safe.
* It demonstrated the status of the deceased and his family.
* It retained the deceased&#x27;s place in society.
* It was a place where offerings could be brought to the deceased.

In ancient Egypt, high social status was considered absolutely positive, and the monumental social inequalities were symbolized by gigantic pyramids versus smaller mastabas. The sizes of tombs were regulated officially, with their allowed dimensions written down in royal decrees. In the Old Kingdom only kings and queens could have a pyramid tomb. Architectural layout and funeral equipment were also sanctioned, and were, like access to material and workers, at the discretion of the king.

The Great Pyramid&#x27;s internal chambers lack inscriptions and decorations, the norm for Egyptian tombs of the fourth to late fifth dynasty, apart from work-gang graffiti that include Khufu&#x27;s names. Constructed around 2600 BC, it predates the custom of inscribing pyramids with text by over 200 years.

The pyramid complex of Khufu included two temples that were lavishly decorated and inscribed. The pyramid temple was dedicated to the Sed festival, celebrating Khufu&#x27;s 30th jubilee. Surviving scenes portray Khufu, officials, priests and other characters performing rituals. The valley temple remains largely unexcavated, but blocks reused by Amenemhat I depict, for instance, nautical scenes and personifications of the estates of Khufu (e.g. the estate &quot;Khufu is beautiful&quot;). The mortuary cult of Khufu which operated in these temples for hundreds of years indicates that Khufu was successfully interred in the Great Pyramid. That the funeral was carried out by Khufu&#x27;s son and successor Djedefre is evidenced by the presence of his cartouches on the blocks that sealed the boat pits next to the pyramid.

The Great Pyramid was likely looted as early as the First Intermediate Period and may have been reused afterwards. Arab accounts tell stories of mummies and treasures being found inside the pyramid. For instance, Al-Maqrizi (1364–1442) reports the discovery of three shrouded bodies, a sarcophagus filled with gold, and a corpse in golden armour with a sword of inestimable value and a ruby as large as an egg.

== Attribution to Khufu ==
Historically the Great Pyramid had been attributed to Khufu based on the words of authors of classical antiquity, first and foremost Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus. During the Middle Ages other people were credited with the construction of the pyramid as well, for example Joseph from the Book of Genesis, Nimrod, or the legendary king Saurid ibn Salhouk.

In 1837 four additional relieving chambers were found above the King&#x27;s Chamber after tunnelling to them. The chambers, previously inaccessible, were covered in hieroglyphs of red paint. The workers who were building the pyramid had marked the blocks with the names of their gangs, which included the pharaoh&#x27;s name (e.g.: &quot;The gang, The white crown of Khnum-Khufu is powerful&quot;). The names of Khufu were spelled out on the walls over a dozen times. Another of these graffiti was found by Goyon on an exterior block of the 4th layer of the pyramid. The inscriptions are comparable to those found at other sites of Khufu, such as the alabaster quarry at Hatnub or the harbour at Wadi al-Jarf, and are present in pyramids of other pharaohs as well.

Throughout the 20th century the cemeteries next to the pyramid were excavated. Family members and high officials of Khufu were buried in the East Field south of the causeway, and the West Field, including the wives, children and grandchildren of Khufu, Hemiunu, Ankhaf and (the funerary cache of) Hetepheres I, mother of Khufu. As Hassan puts it: &quot;From the early dynastic times, it was always the custom for the relatives, friends and courtiers to be buried in the vicinity of the king they had served during life. This was quite in accordance with the Egyptian idea of the Hereafter.&quot;

The cemeteries were actively expanded until the 6th dynasty and used less frequently afterwards. The earliest pharaonic name of seal impressions is that of Khufu, the latest of Pepi II. Worker graffiti were written on some of the stones of the tombs as well; for instance, &quot;Mddw&quot; (Horus name of Khufu) on the mastaba of Chufunacht, probably a grandson of Khufu.

Some inscriptions in the chapels of the mastabas (like the pyramid, their burial chambers were usually bare of inscriptions) mention Khufu or his pyramid. For instance, an inscription of Mersyankh III states that &quot;Her mother [is the] daughter of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Khufu.&quot; Most often these references are part of a title, for example, Snnw-ka, &quot;Chief of the Settlement and Overseer of the Pyramid City of Akhet-Khufu&quot; or Nykahap, &quot;priest of Khufu who presides over the pyramid Akhet-Khufu&quot;. Several tomb owners have a king&#x27;s name as part of their own name (e.g. Chufudjedef, Chufuseneb, Merichufu). The earliest pharaoh alluded to in that manner at Giza is Snefru (Khufu&#x27;s father).

In 1936 Hassan uncovered a stela of Amenhotep II near the Great Sphinx of Giza, which implies the two larger pyramids were still attributed to Khufu and Khafre in the New Kingdom. It reads: &quot;He yoked the horses in Memphis, when he was still young, and stopped at the Sanctuary of Hor-em-akhet (the Sphinx). He spent a time there in going round it, looking at the beauty of the Sanctuary of Khufu and Khafra the revered.&quot;

In 1954 two boat pits, one containing the Khufu ship, were discovered buried at the south foot of the pyramid. The cartouche of Djedefre was found on many of the blocks that covered the boat pits. As the successor and eldest son he would have presumably been responsible for the burial of Khufu. The second boat pit was examined in 1987; excavation work started in 2010. Graffiti on the stones included 4 instances of the name &quot;Khufu&quot;, 11 instances of &quot;Djedefre&quot;, a year (in reign, season, month and day), measurements of the stone, various signs and marks, and a reference line used in construction, all done in red or black ink.

During excavations in 2013 the Diary of Merer was found at Wadi al-Jarf. It documents the transportation of white limestone blocks from Tura to the Great Pyramid, which is mentioned by its original name Akhet Khufu (with a pyramid determinative) dozens of times. It details that the stones were accepted at She Akhet-Khufu (&quot;the pool of the pyramid Horizon of Khufu&quot;) and Ro-She Khufu (&quot;the entrance to the pool of Khufu&quot;), which were under supervision of Ankhhaf, the half brother and vizier of Khufu, and the owner of the largest mastaba of the Giza East Field.
== Age ==

The Great Pyramid has been determined to be about 4,600 years old by two principal approaches: indirectly, through its attribution to Khufu and his chronological age, based on archaeological and textual evidence; and directly, via radiocarbon dating of organic material found in the pyramid and included in its mortar.

=== Historical chronology ===

In the past the Great Pyramid was dated by its attribution to Khufu alone, putting the construction of the Great Pyramid within his reign, hence dating the pyramid was a matter of dating Khufu and the 4th dynasty. The relative sequence and synchronicity of events is the focal point of this method.

Absolute calendar dates are derived from an interlocked network of evidence, the backbone of which are the lines of succession known from ancient king lists and other texts. The reign lengths from Khufu to known points in the earlier past are summated, bolstered with genealogical data, astronomical observations, and other sources. As such, the historical chronology of Egypt is primarily a political chronology, thus independent from other types of archaeological evidence like stratigraphies, material culture, or radiocarbon dating.

The majority of recent chronological estimates date Khufu and his pyramid between 2700 and 2500 BC.

=== Radiocarbon dating ===

Mortar was used generously in the Great Pyramid&#x27;s construction. In the mixing process ashes from fires were added to the mortar, organic material that could be extracted and radiocarbon dated. A total of 46 samples of the mortar were taken in 1984 and 1995, making sure they were clearly inherent to the original structure and could not have been incorporated at a later date. The results were calibrated to 2871–2604 BC. The old wood problem is thought to be mainly responsible for the 100–300 year offset, since the age of the organic material was determined, not when it was last used. A reanalysis of the data gave a completion date for the pyramid between 2620 and 2484 BC, based on the younger samples.

In 1872 Waynman Dixon opened the lower pair of &quot;Air-Shafts&quot;, previously closed at both ends, by chiseling holes into the walls of the Queen&#x27;s Chamber. One of the objects found within was a cedar plank, which came into possession of James Grant, a friend of Dixon. After inheritance it was donated to the Museum of Aberdeen in 1946; however, it had broken into pieces and was filed incorrectly. Lost in the vast museum collection, it was only rediscovered in 2020, when it was radiocarbon dated to 3341–3094 BC. Being over 500 years older than Khufu&#x27;s chronological age, Abeer Eladany suggests that the wood originated from the centre of a long-lived tree or had been recycled for many years prior to being deposited in the pyramid.

=== History of dating Khufu and the Great Pyramid ===
Circa 450 BC Herodotus attributed the Great Pyramid to Cheops (Hellenization of Khufu), yet erroneously placed his reign following the Ramesside period. Manetho, around 200 years later, composed an extensive list of Egyptian kings, which he divided into dynasties, assigning Khufu to the 4th. However, after phonetic changes in the Egyptian language and consequently the Greek translation, &quot;Cheops&quot; had transformed into &quot;Souphis&quot; (and similar versions).

Greaves, in 1646, reported the great difficulty of ascertaining a date for the pyramid&#x27;s construction based on the lacking and conflicting historic sources. Because of the differences in spelling, he did not recognize Khufu on Manetho&#x27;s king list (as transcribed by Africanus and Eusebius), hence he relied on Herodotus&#x27; incorrect account. Summating the duration of lines of succession, Greaves concluded 1266 BC to be the beginning of Khufu&#x27;s reign.

Two centuries later, some of the gaps and uncertainties in Manetho&#x27;s chronology had been cleared by discoveries such as the King Lists of Turin, Abydos, and Karnak. The names of Khufu found within the Great Pyramid&#x27;s relieving chambers in 1837 helped to make clear that Cheops and Souphis are one and the same. Thus the Great Pyramid was recognized to have been built in the 4th dynasty. The dating among Egyptologists still varied by multiple centuries (around 4000–2000 BC), depending on methodology, preconceived religious notions (such as the biblical deluge) and which source they thought was more credible.

Estimates significantly narrowed in the 20th century, most being within 250 years of each other, around the middle of the third millennium BC. The newly developed radiocarbon dating method confirmed that the historic chronology was approximately correct. It is still not a perfectly accurate method due to larger margins of error, calibration uncertainties and the problem of inbuilt age (time between growth and final usage) in plant material, including wood. Astronomical alignments have also been suggested to coincide with the time of construction.

Egyptian chronology continues to be refined and data from multiple disciplines have started to be factored in, such as luminescence dating, radiocarbon dating, and dendrochronology. For instance, Ramsey et al. included over 200 radiocarbon samples in their model.

==Historiographical record==

===Classical antiquity===

====Herodotus====

The ancient Greek historian Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BC, is one of the first major authors to mention the pyramid. In the second book of his work &quot;The Histories&quot;, he discusses the history of Egypt and the Great Pyramid. This report was created more than 2000 years after the structure was built, meaning that Herodotus obtained his knowledge mainly from a variety of indirect sources, including officials and priests of low rank, local Egyptians, Greek immigrants, and Herodotus&#x27;s own interpreters. Accordingly, his explanations present themselves as a mixture of comprehensible descriptions, personal descriptions, erroneous reports, and fantastical legends; as a result, many of the speculative errors and confusions about the monument can be traced back to Herodotus and his work.

Herodotus writes that the Great Pyramid was built by Khufu (Hellenized as Cheops) who, he erroneously relays, ruled after the Ramesside Period (the 19th dynasty and the 20th dynasty). Khufu was a tyrannical king, Herodotus claims, which may explain the Greek&#x27;s view that such buildings can only come about through cruel exploitation of the people. Herodotus states that gangs of 100,000 labourers worked on the building in three-month shifts, taking 20 years to build. In the first ten years a wide causeway was erected, which, according to Herodotus, was almost as impressive as the construction of the pyramids themselves. It measured nearly long and wide, and elevated to a height of , consisting of stone polished and carved with figures.

Underground chambers were made on the hill where the pyramids stand. These were intended to be burial places for Khufu himself and were supplied with water by a channel brought in from the Nile. Herodotus later states that at the Pyramid of Khafre (beside the Great Pyramid) the Nile flows through a built passage to an island in which Khufu is buried. Hawass interprets this to be a reference to the &quot;Osiris Shaft&quot;, which is located at the causeway of Khafre, south of the Great Pyramid.

Herodotus described an inscription on the outside of the pyramid, which, according to his translators, indicated the amount of radishes, garlic and onions that the workers would have eaten while working on the pyramid. This could be a note of restoration work that Khaemweset, son of Rameses II, had carried out. Apparently, Herodotus&#x27; companions and interpreters could not read the hieroglyphs or deliberately gave him false information.

====Diodorus Siculus====
Between 60 and 56 BC, the ancient Greek historian Diodorus Siculus visited Egypt and later dedicated the first book of his &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot; to the land, its history, and its monuments, including the Great Pyramid. Diodorus&#x27;s work was inspired by historians of the past, but he also distanced himself from Herodotus, who Diodorus claims tells marvellous tales and myths. Diodorus presumably drew his knowledge from the lost work of Hecataeus of Abdera, and like Herodotus, he also places the builder of the pyramid, &quot;Chemmis&quot;, after Ramses III. According to his report, neither Chemmis (Khufu) nor Cephren (Khafre) were buried in their pyramids, but rather in secret places, for fear that the people ostensibly forced to build the structures would seek out the bodies for revenge. With this assertion, Diodorus strengthened the connection between pyramid building and slavery.

According to Diodorus, the cladding of the pyramid was still in excellent condition at the time, whereas the uppermost part of the pyramid was formed by a platform high. About the construction of the pyramid he notes that it was built with the help of ramps since no lifting tools had yet been invented. Nothing was left of the ramps, as they were removed after the pyramids were completed. He estimated the number of workers necessary to erect the Great Pyramid at 360,000 and the construction time at 20 years. Similar to Herodotus, Diodorus also claims that the side of the pyramid is inscribed with writing that &quot;[set] forth [the price of] vegetables and purgatives for the workmen there were paid out over sixteen hundred talents.&quot;

====Strabo====

The Greek geographer, philosopher, and historian Strabo visited Egypt around 25 BC, shortly after Egypt was annexed by the Romans. In his work &quot;Geographica&quot;, he argues that the pyramids were the burial place of kings, but he does not mention which king was buried in the structure. Strabo also mentions: &quot;At a moderate height in one of the sides is a stone, which may be taken out; when that is removed, there is an oblique passage to the tomb.&quot; This statement has generated much speculation, as it suggests that the pyramid could be entered at this time.

====Pliny the Elder====

The Roman writer Pliny the Elder, writing in the first century AD, argued that the Great Pyramid had been raised, either &quot;to prevent the lower classes from remaining unoccupied&quot;, or as a measure to prevent the pharaoh&#x27;s riches from falling into the hands of his rivals or successors. Pliny does not speculate as to the pharaoh in question, explicitly noting that &quot;accident [has] consigned to oblivion the names of those who erected such stupendous memorials of their vanity&quot;.

In pondering how the stones could be transported to such a vast height he gives two explanations: That either vast mounds of nitre and salt were heaped up against the pyramid, which were then melted away with water redirected from the river. Or, that &quot;bridges&quot; were constructed, their bricks afterwards distributed for erecting houses, arguing that the level of the river is too low for canals to bring water up to the pyramid. Pliny also recounts how &quot;in the interior of the largest Pyramid there is a well, eighty-six cubits [] deep, which communicates with the river, it is thought&quot;. He also describes a method discovered by Thales of Miletus for ascertaining the pyramid&#x27;s height by measuring its shadow.

===Late antiquity and the Middle Ages===

During late antiquity, a misinterpretation of the pyramids as &quot;Joseph&#x27;s granary&quot; began to gain in popularity. The first textual evidence of this connection is found in the travel narratives of the female Christian pilgrim Egeria, who records that on her visit between 381 and 384 AD, &quot;in the twelve-mile stretch between Memphis and Babylonia [= Old Cairo] are many pyramids, which Joseph made in order to store corn.&quot; Ten years later the usage is confirmed in the anonymous travelogue of seven monks who set out from Jerusalem to visit the famous ascetics in Egypt, wherein they report that they &quot;saw Joseph&#x27;s granaries, where he stored grain in biblical times&quot;.

This late 4th-century usage is further confirmed in the geographical treatise &quot;Cosmographia&quot;, written by Julius Honorius around 376 AD, which explains that the Pyramids were called the &quot;granaries of Joseph&quot; (). This reference from Julius is important, as it indicates that the identification was starting to spread out from pilgrim&#x27;s travelogues. In 530 AD, Stephanos of Byzantium added more to this idea when he wrote in his &quot;Ethnica&quot; that the word &quot;pyramid&quot; was connected to the Greek word (), meaning wheat.

In the seventh century AD, the Rashidun Caliphate conquered Egypt, ending several centuries of Romano-Byzantine rule. A few centuries later, in 832 AD, the Abbasid caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun (786–833) is said to have tunnelled into the side of the structure and discovered the ascending passage and its connecting chambers. Around this time a Coptic legend gained popularity that claimed the antediluvian king Surid Ibn Salhouk had built the Great Pyramid. One legend in particular relates how, three hundred years prior to the Great Flood, Surid had a terrifying dream of the world&#x27;s end, and so he ordered the construction of the pyramids so that they might house all the knowledge of Egypt and survive into the present.

The most notable account of this legend was given by al-Masudi (896–956) in his &quot;Akbar al-zaman&quot;, alongside imaginative tales about the pyramid, such as the story of a man who fell three hours down the pyramid&#x27;s well and the tale of an expedition that discovered bizarre finds in the structure&#x27;s inner chambers. &quot;Al-zaman&quot; also contains a report of al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s entering the pyramid and discovering a vessel containing a thousand coins, which just happened to cover the cost of opening the pyramid. (Some speculate that this story is true, but that the coins were planted by Al-Ma&#x27;mun to appease his workers, who were likely frustrated that they had found no treasure.)

In 987 AD, the Arab bibliographer Ibn al-Nadim relates a fantastical tale in his &quot;al-Fihrist&quot; about a man who journeyed into the main chamber of a pyramid, which Bayard Dodge argues is the Great Pyramid. According to Ibn al-Nadim, the person in question saw a statue of a man holding a tablet and a woman holding a mirror. Supposedly, between the statues was a &quot;stone vessel [with] a gold cover&quot;. Inside the vessel was &quot;something like pitch&quot;, and when the explorer reached into the vessel &quot;a gold receptacle happened to be inside&quot;. The receptacle, when taken from the vessel, was filled with &quot;fresh blood&quot;, which quickly dried up. Ibn al-Nadim&#x27;s work also claims that the bodies of a man and woman were discovered inside the pyramid in the &quot;best possible state of preservation&quot;.

The author al-Kaisi, in his work the &quot;Tohfat Alalbab,&quot; retells the story of al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s entry but with the additional discovery of &quot;an image of a man in green stone&quot;, which when opened revealed a body dressed in jewel-encrusted gold armour. Al-Kaisi claims to have seen the case from which the body was taken, and asserts that it was located at the king&#x27;s palace in Cairo. He also writes that he entered into the pyramid and discovered many preserved bodies. Another attempt to enter the pyramid in search of treasure is recorded during the vizierate of al-Afdal Shahanshah (1094–1121), but it was abandoned after a member of the party was lost in the passages.

The Arab polymath Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (1163–1231) studied the pyramid with great care, and in his &quot;Account of Egypt&quot;, he praises them as works of engineering genius. In addition to measuring the structure, alongside the other pyramids at Giza, al-Baghdadi also writes that the structures were surely tombs, although he thought the Great Pyramid was used for the burial of Agathodaimon or Hermes. Al-Baghdadi ponders whether the pyramid pre-dated the Great Flood as described in Genesis, and even briefly entertained the idea that it was a pre-Adamic construction. A few centuries later, the Islamic historian Al-Maqrizi (1364–1442) compiled lore about the Great Pyramid in his &quot;Al-Khitat&quot;. In addition to reasserting that Al-Ma&#x27;mun breached the structure in 820 AD, Al-Maqrizi&#x27;s work also discusses the sarcophagus in the coffin chambers, explicitly noting that the pyramid was a grave.

By the Late Middle Ages, the Great Pyramid had gained a reputation as a haunted structure. Others feared entering because it was home to animals like bats.

==Construction==

=== Preparation of the site ===
A hillock forms the base on which the pyramid stands. It was cut back into steps and only a strip around the perimeter was leveled, which has been measured to be horizontal and flat to within . The bedrock reaches a height of almost above the pyramid base at the location of the Grotto.

Along the sides of the base platform a series of holes are cut in the bedrock. Lehner hypothesizes that they held wooden posts used for alignment. Edwards, among others, suggested the use of water for evening the base, although it is unclear how practical and workable such a system would be.

=== Materials ===

The Great Pyramid consists of an estimated 2.3 million blocks. Approximately 5.5 million tonnes of limestone, 8,000 tonnes of granite, and 500,000 tonnes of mortar were used in the construction.

Most of the blocks were quarried at Giza just south of the pyramid, an area now known as the Central Field. They are a particular type of nummulitic limestone formed of the fossils of prehistoric shell creatures, whose small disc form can still be seen in some of the pyramid&#x27;s blocks upon close inspection. Other fossils have been found in the blocks and other structures on the site, including fossilized shark teeth. The white limestone used for the casing was transported by boat across the Nile from the Tura quarries of the Eastern Desert plateau, about south-east of the Giza plateau. In 2013, rolls of papyrus called the Diary of Merer were discovered, written by a supervisor of the deliveries of limestone from Tura to Giza in the 27th year of Khufu&#x27;s reign.

The granite stones in the pyramid were transported from Aswan, more than south. The largest, weighing 25 to 80 tonnes, form the ceilings of the &quot;King&#x27;s chamber&quot; and the &quot;relieving chambers&quot; above it. Ancient Egyptians cut stone into rough blocks by hammering grooves into natural stone faces, inserting wooden wedges, then soaking these with water. As the water was absorbed, the wedges expanded, breaking off workable chunks. Once the blocks were cut, they were carried by boat on the Nile to the pyramid and used a now dry offshoot of the river to transport blocks closer to the site.

=== Workforce ===
The ancient Greeks believed that slave labour was used, but modern discoveries made at nearby workers&#x27; camps associated with construction at Giza suggest that it was built by thousands of conscript labourers.

Worker graffiti found at Giza suggest haulers were divided into &quot;zau&quot; (singular &quot;za&quot;), groups of 40 men, consisting of four sub-units that each had an &quot;Overseer of Ten&quot;.

As to the question of how over two million blocks could have been cut within Khufu&#x27;s lifetime, stonemason Franck Burgos conducted an archaeological experiment based on an abandoned quarry of Khufu discovered in 2017. Within it, an almost completed block and the tools used for cutting it had been uncovered: hardened arsenic copper chisels, wooden mallets, ropes and stone tools. In the experiment replicas of these were used to cut a block weighing about 2.5 tonnes (the average block size used for the Great Pyramid). It took four workers 4 days (with each working 6 hours a day) to excavate it. The initially slow progress speeded up six times when the stone was wetted with water. Based on the data, Burgos extrapolates that about 3,500 quarry-men could have produced the 250 blocks/day needed to complete the Great Pyramid in 27 years.

A construction management study conducted in 1999, in association with Mark Lehner and other Egyptologists, had estimated that the total project required an average workforce of about 13,200 people and a peak workforce of roughly 40,000.

=== Surveys and design ===

The first precise measurements of the pyramid were made by Egyptologist Flinders Petrie in 1880–1882, published as &quot;The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh&quot;. Many of the casing-stones and inner chamber blocks of the Great Pyramid fit together with high precision, with joints, on average, only wide. In contrast, core blocks were only roughly shaped, with rubble inserted between larger gaps. Mortar was used to bind the outer layers together and fill gaps and joints.

The block height and weight tends to get progressively smaller towards the top. Petrie measured the lowest layer to be high, whereas the layers towards the summit barely exceed .

The accuracy of the pyramid&#x27;s perimeter is such that the four sides of the base have an average error of only in length and the finished base was squared to a mean corner error of only 12 seconds of arc.

The completed design dimensions are measured to have originally been high by long at each of the four sides of its base. Ancient Egyptians used seked – how much run for one cubit of rise – to describe slopes. For the Great Pyramid a seked of palms was chosen, a ratio of 14 up to 11 in.

Some Egyptologists suggest this slope was chosen because the ratio of perimeter to height (1760/280 cubits) equals 2π to an accuracy of better than 0.05 percent (corresponding to the well-known approximation of π as 22/7). Verner wrote, &quot;We can conclude that although the ancient Egyptians could not precisely define the value of π, in practice they used it&quot;. Petrie concluded: &quot;but these relations of areas and of circular ratio are so systematic that we should grant that they were in the builder&#x27;s design&quot;. Others have argued that the ancient Egyptians had no concept of pi and would not have thought to encode it in their monuments and that the observed pyramid slope may be based on the seked choice alone.

==== Alignment to the cardinal directions ====
The sides of the Great Pyramid&#x27;s base are closely aligned to the four geographic (not magnetic) cardinal directions, deviating on average 3 minutes and 38 seconds of arc, or about a tenth of a degree. Several methods have been proposed for how the ancient Egyptians achieved this level of accuracy:

* The solar gnomon method: The shadow of a vertical rod is tracked throughout a day. The shadow line is intersected by a circle drawn around the base of the rod. Connecting the intersecting points produces an east–west line. An experiment using this method resulted in lines being, on average, 2 minutes, 9 seconds off due east–west. Employing a pinhole produced much more accurate results (19 arc seconds off), whereas using an angled block as a shadow definer was less accurate (3′ 47″ off).
* The pole star method: The polar star is tracked using a movable sight and fixed plumb line. Halfway between the maximum eastern and western elongations is true north. Thuban, the polar star during the Old Kingdom, was about two degrees removed from the celestial pole at the time.
* The simultaneous transit method: The stars Mizar and Kochab appear on a vertical line on the horizon, close to true north around 2500 BC. They slowly and simultaneously shift east over time, which is used to explain the relative misalignment of the pyramids.

===Construction theories===

Many alternative, often contradictory, theories have been proposed regarding the pyramid&#x27;s construction techniques. One mystery of the pyramid&#x27;s construction is its planning. John Romer suggests that they used the same method that had been used for earlier and later constructions, laying out parts of the plan on the ground at a 1-to-1 scale. He writes that &quot;such a working diagram would also serve to generate the architecture of the pyramid with precision unmatched by any other means&quot;.

The basalt blocks of the pyramid temple show &quot;clear evidence&quot; of having been cut with some kind of saw with an estimated cutting blade of in length. Romer suggests that this &quot;super saw&quot; may have had copper teeth and weighed up to . He theorizes that such a saw could have been attached to a wooden trestle support and possibly used in conjunction with vegetable oil, cutting sand, emery or pounded quartz to cut the blocks, which would have required the labour of at least a dozen men to operate it.

== Casing ==

At completion, the Great Pyramid was cased entirely in white limestone. Precisely worked blocks were placed in horizontal layers and carefully fitted together with mortar, their outward faces cut at a slope and smoothed to a high degree. Together they created four uniform surfaces, angled at 51°50&#x27;40&quot; (a seked of palms). Unfinished casing blocks of the pyramids of Menkaure and Henutsen at Giza suggest that the front faces were smoothed only after the stones were laid, with chiselled seams marking correct positioning and where the superfluous rock would have to be trimmed off.

The height of the horizontal layers is not uniform but varies considerably. The highest of the 203 remaining courses are towards the bottom, the first layer being the tallest at . Towards the top, layers tend to be only slightly over in height, with stones weighing around . An irregular pattern is noticeable when looking at the sizes in sequence, where layer height declines steadily only to rise sharply again.

So-called &quot;backing stones&quot; supported the casing, which were (unlike core blocks), precisely dressed as well and bound to the casing with mortar. Now, these stones give the structure its visible appearance, following the partial dismantling of the pyramid in the Middle Ages. Amidst earthquakes in northern Egypt, workers stripped away many of the outer casing stones, which were said to have been carted away by Bahri Sultan An-Nasir Nasir-ad-Din al-Hasan in 1356 for use in nearby Cairo.

Later explorers reported massive piles of rubble at the base of the pyramids left over from the continuing collapse of the casing stones, which were subsequently cleared away during continuing excavations of the site. Today a few of the casing stones from the lowest course can be seen &quot;in situ&quot; on each side, with the best preserved on the north below the entrances, excavated by Vyse in 1837.

The mortar was chemically analyzed and contains organic inclusions (mostly charcoal), samples of which were radiocarbon dated to 2871–2604 BC. It has been theorized that the mortar enabled the masons to set the stones exactly by providing a level bed.

Although it has been suggested that some or all of the casing stones were made from a type of concrete that was cast in place, rather than quarried and moved, archaeological evidence and petrographic analysis indicate this was not the case.

Petrie noted in 1880 the four sides of the pyramid to be &quot;very distinctly hollowed&quot; and that &quot;each side has a sort of groove specially down the middle of the face&quot;, which he reasoned was a result of increased casing thickness in these areas. Under certain lighting conditions and with image enhancement the faces can appear to be split, leading to speculation that the pyramid had been intentionally constructed eight-sided. Laser scanning and photogrammetrical surveys concluded the concavities of the four sides to be the result of the removal of the casing stones, which damaged the underlying blocks that form the outer surface today.

== Pyramidion and missing tip ==
The pyramid was once topped by a capstone known as a pyramidion. The material from which it was made is subject to much speculation; limestone, granite or basalt are commonly proposed, while in popular culture it is often solid gold, gilded or electrum. All known 4th dynasty &quot;pyramidia&quot; (of the Red Pyramid, Satellite Pyramid of Khufu (G1-d) and Queen&#x27;s Pyramid of Menkaure (G3-a)) are of white limestone and were not gilded. Only from the 5th dynasty onward is there evidence of gilded capstones; for instance, a scene on the causeway of Sahure speaks of the &quot;white gold pyramidion of the pyramid Sahure&#x27;s Soul Shines&quot;.

The Great Pyramid&#x27;s pyramidion was already lost in classical antiquity, as Pliny the Elder and later authors report a platform on its summit. Over time more stones were removed from the peak, and nowadays the pyramid is about shorter than it was when intact, with about of material missing from the top.

In 1874 a mast was installed on the top by the Scottish astronomer David Gill who, while returning from observing a rare Venus transit, was invited to survey Egypt and began by surveying the Great Pyramid. His measurements of the pyramid were accurate to within 1 mm. The mast was damaged in 2019 by a man who evaded security and climbed the pyramid; however, as the mast was periodically changed due to erosion and so was considered a modern object, the trespasser did not violate Egypt&#x27;s strict laws regarding antiquities.

==Interior==

The internal structure consists of three main chambers (the King&#x27;s, Queen&#x27;s and Subterranean Chambers), the Grand Gallery and various corridors and shafts. None of the interior walls were decorated or inscribed, as was the norm for tombs of the 4th dynasty, apart from the marks and names of work-gangs left on blocks of the relieving chambers.

There are two entrances into the pyramid: the original and a forced passage, which meet at a junction. From there, one passage descends into the Subterranean Chamber, while the other ascends to the Grand Gallery. From the beginning of the gallery three paths can be taken:

* a vertical shaft that leads down, past a grotto, to meet the descending passage
* a horizontal corridor leading to the Queen&#x27;s Chamber
* and the path up the gallery itself to the King&#x27;s Chamber that contains the sarcophagus.

Both the King&#x27;s and Queen&#x27;s Chamber have a pair of small &quot;air-shafts&quot;. Above the King&#x27;s Chamber are a series of five relieving chambers.

=== Entrances ===
==== Original entrance ====
The original entrance is on the north side, east of the centreline of the pyramid. Before the removal of the casing in the Middle Ages, the pyramid was entered through a hole in the 19th layer of masonry, approximately above the pyramid&#x27;s base level. The height of that layer – – corresponds to the size of the entrance tunnel that is commonly called the Descending Passage. According to Strabo (64–24 BC) a movable stone could be raised to enter this sloping corridor; however, it is not known if it was a later addition or original.

A row of double chevrons diverts weight away from the entrance. Several of these chevron blocks are now missing, as indicated by the slanted faces on which they once rested.

Numerous, mostly modern, graffiti is cut into the stones around the entrance. Most notable is a large, square text of hieroglyphs carved in honor of Frederick William IV, by Karl Richard Lepsius&#x27;s Prussian expedition to Egypt in 1842.

===== North Face Corridor =====
In 2016 the ScanPyramids team detected a cavity behind the entrance chevrons using muography, which was confirmed in 2019 to be a corridor at least long, and running horizontal or sloping upwards (thus not parallel to the Descending Passage).

In February 2023 the North Face Corridor was explored with an endoscopic camera, revealing a horizontal tunnel with a length of and a transverse section of about . Its ceiling is formed by large chevrons, like those visible above the original entrance and also similar to relieving chambers.

====Robbers&#x27; Tunnel====
Today tourists enter the Great Pyramid via the Robbers&#x27; Tunnel, which was long ago cut straight through the masonry of the pyramid. The entrance was forced into the 6th and 7th layer of the casing, about above the base. After running more or less straight and horizontal for it turns sharply left to encounter the blocking stones in the Ascending Passage. It is possible to enter the Descending Passage from this point but access is usually forbidden.

The origin of this Robbers&#x27; Tunnel is the subject of much scholarly discussion. According to tradition the opening was made around 820 AD by Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s workmen with a battering ram. The digging dislodged the stone in the ceiling of the Descending Passage that hid the entrance to the Ascending Passage, and the noise of that stone falling, then sliding down the Descending Passage alerted them to the need to turn left. Unable to remove these stones, the workmen tunnelled upwards beside them through the softer limestone of the Pyramid until they reached the Ascending Passage.

Due to historical and archaeological discrepancies, many scholars (with Antoine de Sacy perhaps being the first) contend that this story is apocryphal. They argue that it is much more likely that the tunnel had been carved shortly after the pyramid was initially sealed. This tunnel, the scholars continue, was then resealed (likely during the Ramesside Restoration), and it was this plug that al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s ninth-century expedition cleared away. This theory is furthered by the report of patriarch Dionysius I Telmaharoyo, who claimed that before al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s expedition, there already existed a breach in the pyramid&#x27;s north face that extended into the structure before hitting a dead end. This suggests that some sort of robber&#x27;s tunnel predated al-Ma&#x27;mun, and that the caliph enlarged it and cleared it of debris.

=== Descending Passage ===
From the original entrance, a passage descends through the masonry of the pyramid and then into the bedrock beneath it, ultimately leading to the Subterranean Chamber.

It has a slanted height of 4 Egyptian feet (1.20 m; 3.9 ft) and a width of . Its angle of 26°26&#x27;46&quot; corresponds to a ratio of 1 to 2 (rise over run).

After , the lower end of the Ascending Passage is reached; a in the ceiling, which is blocked by granite stones and might have originally been concealed. To circumvent these hard stones, a short tunnel was excavated that meets the end of the Robbers&#x27; Tunnel. This was expanded over time and fitted with stairs.

The passage continues to descend for another , now through bedrock instead of the pyramid superstructure. Lazy guides used to block off this part with rubble to avoid having to lead people down and back up the long shaft, until around 1902 when Covington installed a padlocked iron grill-door to stop this practice. Near the end of this section, on the west wall, is the connection to the vertical shaft that leads up to the Grand Gallery.

A horizontal shaft connects the end of the Descending Passage to the Subterranean Chamber, It has a length of , width of and height of . A is located towards the end of the western wall, slightly larger than the tunnel, the ceiling of which is irregular and undressed.

=== Subterranean Chamber ===
The Subterranean Chamber, or &quot;Pit&quot;, is the lowest of the three main chambers and the only one dug into the bedrock beneath the pyramid.

Located about below base level, it measures roughly north-south by east-west, with an approximate height of .
The western half of the room, apart from the ceiling, is unfinished, with trenches left behind by the quarry-men running east to west. A niche was cut into the northern half of the west wall. The only access, through the Descending Passage, lies on the eastern end of the north wall.

Although seemingly known in antiquity, according to Herodotus and later authors, its existence had been forgotten in the Middle Ages until rediscovery in 1817, when Giovanni Caviglia cleared the rubble blocking the Descending Passage.

Opposing the entrance, a blind corridor runs straight south for and continues with a slight bend another , measuring about squared. A Greek or Roman character was found on its ceiling with the light of a candle, suggesting that the chamber had indeed been accessible during Classical antiquity.

In the middle of the eastern half is a large hole called a Pit Shaft or Perring&#x27;s Shaft. The uppermost part may have ancient origins, about squared in width and in depth, diagonally aligned with the chamber. Caviglia and Salt enlarged it to the depth of about . In 1837 Vyse directed the shaft to be sunk to a depth of , in hopes of discovering the chamber encompassed by water that Herodotus alluded to. It is slightly narrower in width at about . No chamber was discovered after Perring and his workers had spent one and a half years penetrating the bedrock to the then water level of the Nile, further down.

The rubble produced during this operation was deposited throughout the chamber. Petrie, visiting in 1880, found the shaft to be partially filled with rainwater that had rushed down the Descending Passage. In 1909, when the Edgar brothers&#x27; surveying activities were encumbered by the material, they moved the sand and smaller stones back into the shaft, leaving the upper part clear. The deep, modern shaft is sometimes mistaken to be part of the original design.

Ludwig Borchardt suggested that the Subterranean Chamber was originally planned to be the burial place for pharaoh Khufu, but that it was abandoned during construction in favour of a chamber higher up in the pyramid.

=== Ascending Passage ===

The Ascending Passage connects the Descending Passage to the Grand Gallery. It is long and of the same width and height as the shaft from which it originates, although its angle is slightly lower at 26°6&#x27;.

The lower end of the shaft is plugged by three granite stones, which were slid down from the Grand Gallery to seal the tunnel. They are , and long respectively. The uppermost is heavily damaged, hence it is shorter. The Robbers&#x27; Tunnel terminates slightly below the stones, so a short tunnel was dug around them to access the Descending Passage, since the surrounding limestone is considerably softer and easier to work.

Most of the joints between the blocks of the walls run perpendicular to the floor, with two exceptions. Firstly, those in the lower third of the corridor are vertical. Secondly, the three girdle stones that are inserted near the middle (about 10 cubits apart) presumably stabilize the tunnel.

=== Well Shaft and Grotto ===

The Well Shaft (also known as the Service Shaft or Vertical Shaft) links the lower end of the Grand Gallery to the bottom of the Descending Passage, about further down.

It takes a winding and indirect course. The upper half goes through the nucleus masonry of the pyramid. It runs vertical at first for , then slightly angles southwards for about the same distance, until it hits bedrock approximately above the pyramid&#x27;s base level. Another vertical section descends further; it is partially lined with masonry that has been broken through to a cavity known as the Grotto. The lower half of the Well Shaft goes through the bedrock at an angle of about 45° for before a steeper section, long, leads to its lowest point. The final section of connects it to the Descending Passage, running almost horizontally. The builders evidently had trouble aligning the lower exit.

The purpose of the shaft is commonly explained as a ventilation shaft for the Subterranean Chamber and as an escape shaft for the workers who slid the blocking stones of the Ascending Passage into place.

The Grotto is a natural limestone cave that was likely filled with sand and gravel before construction, before being hollowed out by looters. A granite block rests in it that likely originated from the portcullis that once sealed the King&#x27;s Chamber.

===Queen&#x27;s Chamber===

The Horizontal Passage links the Grand Gallery to the Queen&#x27;s Chamber. Five pairs of holes at the start suggest the tunnel was once concealed with slabs that lay flush with the gallery floor. The passage is wide and high for most of its length, but near the chamber there is a step in the floor, after which the passage increases to high. Half of the west wall consists of two layers that have atypically continuous vertical joints. Dormion suggests the entrances to magazines laid here and have been filled in.

The Queen&#x27;s Chamber is exactly halfway between the north and south faces of the pyramid. It measures north-south, east-west, and has a pointed roof that apexes at tall. At the eastern end of the chamber is a niche high. The original depth of the niche was , but it has since been deepened by treasure hunters.

Shafts were discovered in the north and south walls of the Queen&#x27;s Chamber in 1872 by British engineer Waynman Dixon, who believed shafts similar to those in the King&#x27;s Chamber must also exist. The shafts were not connected to the outer faces of the pyramid or the Queen&#x27;s Chamber; their purpose is unknown. In one shaft Dixon discovered a ball of diorite, a bronze hook of unknown purpose and a piece of cedar wood. The first two objects are now in the British Museum. The latter was lost until 2020 when it was found at the University of Aberdeen. It has since been radiocarbon dated to 3341–3094 BC. The northern shaft&#x27;s angle of ascent fluctuates and at one point turns 45 degrees to avoid the Great Gallery. The southern shaft is perpendicular to the pyramid&#x27;s slope.

The shafts in the Queen&#x27;s Chamber were explored in 1993 by the German engineer Rudolf Gantenbrink using a crawler robot he designed, &quot;Upuaut 2&quot;. After a climb of , he discovered that one of the shafts was blocked by a limestone &quot;door&quot; with two eroded copper &quot;handles&quot;. The National Geographic Society created a similar robot, which, in September 2002, drilled a small hole in the southern door only to find another stone slab behind it. The northern passage, which was difficult to navigate because of its twists and turns, was also found to be blocked by a slab.

Research continued in 2011 with the Djedi Project, which used a fibre-optic &quot;micro snake camera&quot; that could see around corners. With this, they were able to penetrate the first door of the southern shaft through the hole drilled in 2002, and view all the sides of the small chamber behind it. They discovered hieroglyphic characters written in red paint. Egyptian mathematics researcher Luca Miatello stated that the markings read &quot;121&quot; – the length of the shaft in cubits. The Djedi team were also able to scrutinize the inside of the two copper &quot;handles&quot; embedded in the door, which they now believe to be for decorative purposes. They additionally found the reverse side of the &quot;door&quot; to be finished and polished, which suggests that it was not put there just to block the shaft from debris, but rather for a more specific reason.

===Grand Gallery===

The Grand Gallery continues the slope of the Ascending Passage towards the King&#x27;s Chamber, extending from the 23rd to the 48th course (of stones), a rise of . It has been praised as a &quot;truly spectacular example of stonemasonry&quot;. It is high and long. Its walls are made out of polished limestone. The base is wide, but after two courses – at a height of – the blocks of stone in the walls are corbelled inwards by on each side.

There are seven of these steps, so, at the top, the Grand Gallery is only wide. It is roofed by slabs of stone laid at a slightly steeper angle than the floor so that each stone fits into a slot cut into the top of the gallery, like the teeth of a ratchet. The purpose was to have each block supported by the wall of the Gallery, rather than resting on the block beneath it, in order to prevent cumulative pressure.

At the upper end of the Gallery, on the eastern wall, is a hole near the roof that opens into a short tunnel by which access can be gained to the lowest of the relieving chambers.

The floor of the Grand Gallery has a shelf or step on either side, wide, leaving a lower ramp wide between them. There are 56 slots on the shelves, with 28 on each side. On each wall, 25 niches have been cut above the slots. The purpose of these slots is not known, but the central gutter in the floor of the Gallery, which is the same width as the Ascending Passage, has led to speculation that the blocking stones were stored in the Grand Gallery and the slots held wooden beams to restrain them from sliding down the passage. Jean-Pierre Houdin theorized that they held a timber frame that was used in combination with a trolley to pull the heavy granite blocks up the pyramid.

At the top of the gallery, there is a step onto a small horizontal platform where a tunnel leads through the Antechamber, once blocked by portcullis stones, into the King&#x27;s Chamber.

===The Big Void===
In 2017, scientists from the ScanPyramids project discovered a large cavity above the Grand Gallery using muon radiography, which they called the &quot;ScanPyramids Big Void&quot;. A research team, under the supervision of Professor Morishima Kunihiro at Nagoya University, used special nuclear emulsion detectors. Its length is at least and its cross-section is similar to that of the Grand Gallery. Its existence was confirmed by independent detection with three different technologies: nuclear emulsion films, scintillator hodoscopes, and gas detectors. The purpose of the cavity is unknown and it is not accessible. Zahi Hawass speculates it may have been a gap used in the construction of the Grand Gallery, but the Japanese research team state that the void is completely different from previously identified construction spaces.

To verify and pinpoint the void, a team from Kyushu University, Tohoku University, the University of Tokyo and the Chiba Institute of Technology planned to rescan the structure with a newly developed muon detector in 2020. Their work was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Antechamber ===

The last line of defence against intrusion was a small chamber designed to house portcullis blocking stones, called the Antechamber. It is cased almost entirely in granite and is situated between the upper end of the Grand Gallery and the King&#x27;s Chamber. Three slots for portcullis stones line the east and west wall of the chamber. Each of them is topped with a semi-circular groove for a log, around which ropes could be spanned.

The granite portcullis stones were approximately thick and were lowered into position by ropes, which were tied through four holes at the top of the blocks. A corresponding set of four vertical grooves are on the south wall of the chamber, recesses that make space for the ropes.

The Antechamber has a design flaw: the space above them can be accessed, thus all but the last block can be circumvented. This was exploited by looters who punched a hole through the ceiling of the tunnel behind, gaining access to the King&#x27;s Chamber. Later on, all three portcullis stones were broken and removed. Fragments of these blocks can be found in various locations in the pyramid (the Pit Shaft, the Original Entrance, the Grotto and the recess before the Subterranean Chamber).

===King&#x27;s Chamber===

The King&#x27;s Chamber is the upmost of the three main chambers of the pyramid. It is faced entirely with granite and measures east-west by north-south. Its flat ceiling is about 11 cubits and 5 digits () above the floor, formed by nine slabs of stone weighing in total about 400 tons. All the roof beams show cracks due to the chamber having settled .

The walls consist of five courses of blocks that are uninscribed, as was the norm for burial chambers of the 4th dynasty. The stones are precisely fitted together. The facing surfaces are dressed to varying degrees, with some displaying remains of lifting bosses not entirely cut away. The back sides of the blocks were only roughly hewn to shape, as was usual with Egyptian hard-stone facade blocks, presumably to save work.

==== Sarcophagus ====

The only surviving object in the King&#x27;s Chamber is a sarcophagus made of a single, hollowed-out granite block. When it was rediscovered in the Early Middle Ages, it was found broken open and any contents had already been removed. It is of the form common for early Egyptian sarcophagi, rectangular in shape with grooves to slide the now missing lid into place with three small holes for pegs to fix it. The coffer was not perfectly smoothed, displaying tool marks matching those of copper saws and tubular hand-drills.

The internal dimensions of the sarcophagus are roughly by , the external by , with a height of . The walls have a thickness of about . The sarcophagus is too large to fit around the corner between the Ascending and Descending Passages, which indicates that it must have been placed in the chamber before the roof was put in place.

==== Air shafts ====
In the north and south walls of the King&#x27;s Chamber are two narrow shafts, commonly known as &quot;air shafts&quot;. They face each other and are located approximately above the floor, from the eastern wall, with a width of and a height of . Both start out horizontally for the length of the granite blocks they go through before changing to an upwards direction.

The southern shaft ascends at an angle of 45° with a slight curve westwards. One ceiling stone was found to be distinctly unfinished, which Gantenbrink called a &quot;Monday morning block&quot;. The northern shaft changes angle several times, shifting the path to the west, perhaps to avoid the Big Void. The builders apparently had trouble calculating the right angles, resulting in parts of the shaft being narrower. Now, they both commute to the exterior. Whether they originally penetrated the outer casing is unknown.

The purpose of these shafts is not clear: they were long believed by Egyptologists to be shafts for ventilation, but this idea has now been widely abandoned in favour of the shafts serving a ritualistic purpose associated with the ascension of the king&#x27;s spirit to the heavens.

The idea that the shafts point towards stars or areas of the northern and southern skies has been largely dismissed as the northern shaft follows a dog-leg course through the masonry and the southern shaft has a bend of approximately , indicating no intention to have them point to any celestial objects.

In 1992, as part of the Upuaut project, a ventilation system was installed in both air shafts of the King&#x27;s Chamber.

=== Relieving chambers ===

Above the roof of the King&#x27;s Chamber are five compartments, named (from lowest upwards) &quot;Davison&#x27;s Chamber&quot;, &quot;Wellington&#x27;s Chamber&quot;, &quot;Nelson&#x27;s Chamber&quot;, &quot;Lady Arbuthnot&#x27;s Chamber&quot;, and &quot;Campbell&#x27;s Chamber&quot;.

They were presumably intended to safeguard the King&#x27;s Chamber from the possibility of the roof collapsing under the weight of stone above, hence they are referred to as &quot;relieving chambers&quot;.

The granite blocks that divide the chambers have flat bottom sides but roughly shaped top sides, giving all five chambers an irregular floor, but a flat ceiling, with the exception of the uppermost chamber, which has a pointed limestone roof.

Nathaniel Davison is credited with the discovery of the lowest of these chambers in 1763, although a French merchant named Maynard informed him of its existence. It can be reached through an ancient passage that originates from the top of the south wall of the Grand Gallery. The upper four chambers were discovered in 1837 by Howard Vyse after discovering a crack in the ceiling of the first chamber. This allowed the insertion of a long reed, which, with the employment of gunpowder and boring rods, opened a tunnel upwards through the masonry. As no access shafts existed for the upper four chambers – unlike Davison&#x27;s Chamber – they were completely inaccessible until this point.

Numerous graffiti of red ochre paint were found covering the limestone walls of all four newly discovered chambers. Apart from levelling lines and indication marks for masons, multiple hieroglyphic inscriptions spell out the names of work-gangs. Those names, which were also found in other Egyptian pyramids like that of Menkaure and Sahure, usually included the name of the pharaoh for whom they were working. The blocks must have received the inscriptions before the chambers became inaccessible during construction. Their orientation, often sideways or upside down, and their sometimes being partially covered by blocks, seems to indicate that the stones were inscribed before being laid.

The inscriptions, correctly deciphered only decades after discovery, read as follows:

* &quot;The gang, The Horus Mededuw-is-the-purifier-of-the-two-lands&quot;. Found once in relieving chamber 3. (Mededuw being Khufu&#x27;s Horus name.)
* &quot;The gang, The Horus Mededuw-is-pure&quot; Found seven times in chamber 4.
* &quot;The gang, Khufu-excites-love&quot; Found once in chamber 5 (top chamber).
* &quot;The gang, The-white-crown-of Khnumkhuwfuw-is-powerful&quot; Found once in chambers 2 and 3, ten times in chamber 4 and twice in chamber 5. (Khnum-Khufu being Khufu&#x27;s full birth name.)

==Pyramid complex==

The Great Pyramid is surrounded by a complex of several buildings, including small pyramids.

=== Temples and causeway ===
The Pyramid Temple, which stood on the east side of the pyramid and measured north to south and east to west, has almost entirely disappeared. Only some of the black basalt paving remains. There are only a few remnants of the causeway that linked the pyramid with the valley and the Valley Temple. The Valley Temple is buried beneath the village of Nazlet el-Samman; basalt paving and limestone walls have been found but the site has not been excavated.

=== East cemetery ===
The tomb of Queen Hetepheres I, sister-wife of Sneferu and mother of Khufu, lies east of the Great Pyramid. Discovered by accident by the Reisner expedition, the burial was intact, but the carefully sealed coffin proved to be empty.

==== Subsidiary pyramids ====
On the southern end of the east side are four subsidiary pyramids The three that remain standing to almost full height are popularly known as the Queens&#x27; Pyramids (G1-a, G1-b and G1-c). The fourth, smaller satellite pyramid (G1-d), is so ruined that its existence was not suspected until the first course of stones and, later, the remains of the capstone were discovered during excavations in 1991–1993.

===Boats===

Three boat-shaped pits are located east of the pyramid. They are large enough in size and shape to have held complete boats, though so shallow that any superstructure, if there ever was one, must have been removed or disassembled.

Two additional boat pits, long and rectangular in shape, were found south of the pyramid, still covered with slabs of stone weighing up to 15 tons.

The first of these was discovered in May 1954 by the Egyptian archaeologist Kamal el-Mallakh. Inside were 1,224 pieces of wood, the longest in length, the shortest . These were entrusted to a boat builder, Haj Ahmed Yusuf, who worked out how the pieces fitted together. The entire process, including conservation and straightening of the warped wood, took fourteen years. The result is a cedar-wood boat long, its timbers held together by ropes, which was originally housed in the Giza Solar boat museum, a special boat-shaped, air-conditioned museum beside the pyramid. The boat is now in the Grand Egyptian Museum.

During construction of this museum in the 1980s, the second sealed boat pit was discovered. It was left unopened until 2011 when excavation began on the boat.

=== Pyramid town ===
Flanking the Giza pyramid complex is a cyclopean stone wall, the Wall of the Crow. Mark Lehner discovered a worker&#x27;s town outside the wall, otherwise known as &quot;The Lost City&quot;, dated by pottery styles, seal impressions and stratigraphy to have been constructed and occupied during the reigns of Khafre (2520–2494 BC) and Menkaure (2490–2472 BC). In the early 21st century, Lehner and his team made several discoveries, including what appears to have been a thriving port, suggesting the town and associated living quarters, which consisted of barracks called &quot;galleries&quot;, may not have been for the pyramid workers after all, but rather for the soldiers and sailors who used the port. In light of this new discovery, as to where then the pyramid workers may have lived, Lehner suggested the alternative possibility they may have camped on the ramps he believes were used to construct the pyramids, or possibly at nearby quarries.

In the early 1970s, the Australian archaeologist Karl Kromer excavated a mound in the South Field of the plateau. It contained artefacts including mudbrick seals of Khufu, which Kromer identified with an artisans&#x27; settlement. Mudbrick buildings just south of Khufu&#x27;s Valley Temple contained mud sealings of Khufu and have been suggested to be a settlement serving the cult of Khufu after his death. A worker&#x27;s cemetery used at least between Khufu&#x27;s reign and the end of the Fifth Dynasty was discovered south of the Wall of the Crow by Hawass in 1990.

==Looting==
Authors Bob Brier and Hoyt Hobbs claim that &quot;all the pyramids were robbed&quot; by the New Kingdom, when the construction of royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings began. Joyce Tyldesley states that the Great Pyramid itself &quot;is known to have been opened and emptied by the Middle Kingdom&quot;, before the Arab caliph Al-Ma&#x27;mun entered the pyramid around 820 AD.

I. E. S. Edwards discusses Strabo&#x27;s mention that the pyramid &quot;a little way up one side has a stone that may be taken out, which being raised up there is a sloping passage to the foundations&quot;. Edwards suggested that the pyramid was entered by robbers after the end of the Old Kingdom and sealed and then reopened more than once until Strabo&#x27;s door was added. He adds: &quot;If this highly speculative surmise be correct, it is also necessary to assume either that the existence of the door was forgotten or that the entrance was again blocked with facing stones&quot;, in order to explain why al-Ma&#x27;mun could not find the entrance. Scholars such as Gaston Maspero and Flinders Petrie have noted that evidence for a similar door has been found at the Bent Pyramid of Dashur.

Herodotus visited Egypt in the 5th century BC and recounts a story that he was told concerning vaults under the pyramid built on an island where the body of Khufu lies. Edwards notes that the pyramid had &quot;almost certainly been opened and its contents plundered long before the time of Herodotus&quot; and that it might have been closed again during the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt when other monuments were restored. He suggests that the story told to Herodotus could have been the result of almost two centuries of telling and retelling by pyramid guides.

<text>The Generic Universal Role Playing System, or GURPS, is a tabletop role-playing game system published by Steve Jackson Games. The system is designed to run any genre using the same core mechanics. The core rules were first written by Steve Jackson and published in 1986, at a time when most such systems were story- or genre-specific. Since then, four editions have been published. The current line editor is Sean Punch.

Sessions are run by a game master (GM), who controls the world and adjudicates the rules, with any number of players controlling the actions of a character. Most actions are resolved by rolling three six-sided dice (3d6), trying to roll below a certain number, usually a skill. GURPS uses a point-based character creation system; characters are represented by four basic stats (Strength, Dexterity, IQ and Health), and players can buy any number of advantages, disadvantages, perks, quirks and skills.

GURPS consists of a GURPS Basic Set, which contains the core rules required to run most games. In addition, more than a hundred supplemental books provide optional rules and details about different settings and genres (GURPS Martial Arts, for example). By adapting the various optional rules and systems, GURPS can be run with as much or as little detail as required, and can accommodate virtually any genre, character or style of play.

&quot;GURPS&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Roleplaying Rules of 1988&quot;, and in 2000 it was inducted into the Origins Hall of Fame. Many of its expansions have also won awards.

== Precursors ==
Prior to &quot;GURPS&quot;, most roleplaying games (RPGs) of the 1970s and early 1980s were developed especially for certain gaming environments, and they were largely incompatible with one another. For example, TSR published its &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game specifically for a fantasy environment. Another game from the same company, &quot;Star Frontiers&quot;, was developed for science fiction–based role-playing. TSR produced other games for other environments, such as &quot;Gamma World&quot; (post-apocalyptic adventures), &quot;Top Secret&quot; (spies and secret agents), &quot;Gangbusters&quot; (Roaring Twenties adventures), and &quot;Boot Hill&quot; (American Old West). Each of these games was set with its own self-contained rules system, and the rules for playing each game differed greatly from one game to the next. Attempts were made in &quot;Advanced Dungeons and Dragons&quot; to allow cross-genre games using &quot;Gamma World&quot; and &quot;Boot Hill&quot; rules; however, characters could only be used in a new genre by converting their statistics. Although GURPS was preceded by &quot;Basic Role-Playing&quot; (Chaosium, 1980) and the Hero System (Hero Games, a system that expanded to multiple genres starting in 1982), &quot;GURPS&quot; was the most commercially successful generic role-playing game system to allow players to role-play in any environment they please while still using the same set of core rules. This flexibility of environment is greatly aided by the use of technology levels (or &quot;tech-levels&quot;) that allow a campaign to be set from the Stone Age (TL-0) to the Digital Age (TL-8) or beyond.

== Development and publication ==
The immediate mechanical antecedents of &quot;GURPS&quot; were Steve Jackson&#x27;s microgames &quot;Melee&quot; and &quot;Wizard&quot;, both published by Metagaming Concepts, which eventually combined them along with another Jackson game, &quot;In the Labyrinth&quot;, to form &quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot; (&quot;TFT&quot;), an early role-playing game. Several of the core concepts of &quot;GURPS&quot; first appeared in &quot;TFT&quot;, including the inclusion of Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence as the core abilities scores of each character.

By April 1984, the core rules for &quot;GURPS&quot; (at that point referred to as the &quot;Great Unnamed Universal Role-Playing System&quot;) was being playtested in preparation for a GURPS question-and-answer seminar at Origins 1984 in Dallas. The combat system for GURPS was published in 1985 as &quot;Man to Man: Fantasy Combat from GURPS&quot; to meet the deadline for Origins 1985 and was followed up later that year by the adventure supplement &quot;Orcslayer&quot;.

The &quot;Basic GURPS&quot; set was published in 1986 and 1987 and included two booklets, one for developing characters and one for Adventuring.

In 1990 &quot;GURPS&quot; intersected part of the hacker subculture when the company&#x27;s Austin, Texas, offices were raided by the Secret Service. The target was the author of &quot;GURPS Cyberpunk&quot; in relation to E911 Emergency Response system documents stolen from Bell South. The incident was a direct contributor to the founding of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. A common misconception holds that this raid was part of Operation Sundevil and carried out by the FBI. Operation: Sundevil was in action at the same time, but it was completely separate. See &quot;Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service&quot;.

The 1995 supplement &quot;GURPS Illuminati University&quot; introduced Agatha Heterodyne, the character who would go on to star in the popular comic series &quot;Girl Genius&quot; in 2001.

A free PDF version of the &quot;GURPS&quot; rules was released in 1998 as &quot;GURPS Lite&quot;. This limited ruleset was also included with various books such as &quot;GURPS Discworld&quot; and &quot;Transhuman Space&quot;.

Steve Jackson Games released &quot;GURPS Fourth Edition&quot; at the first day of Gen Con on August 19, 2004. It promised to simplify and streamline most areas of play and character creation. The changes include modification of the attribute point adjustments, an edited and rationalized skill list, clarification of the differences between abilities from experience and from inborn talent, more detailed language rules, and revised technology levels. Designed by Sean Punch, the Fourth Edition is sold as two full-color hardcover books as well as in the PDF format.

== Concept ==

Role-playing games of the 1970s and 1980s, such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, generally used random numbers generated by dice rolls to assign statistics to player characters. In 1978, Jackson designed a new character generation system for the microgames &quot;Melee&quot; and &quot;Wizard&quot; that used a point-buy system: players are given a fixed number of points with which to buy abilities. (The Hero System first used by the &quot;Champions&quot; role-playing game published two years later also used a point-buy system.)

&quot;GURPS&quot;&#x27;s emphasis on its generic aspect has proven to be a successful marketing tactic, as many game series have source engines which can be retrofitted to many styles. Its approach to versatility includes using real world measurements wherever possible (&quot;reality-checking&quot; is an important part of any &quot;GURPS&quot; book).

&quot;GURPS&quot; also benefits from the many dozens of worldbooks describing settings or additional rules in all genres including science fiction, fantasy, and historical. Many game designers began their professional careers as &quot;GURPS&quot; writers, including C. J. Carella, Robin Laws, S. John Ross, and Steffan O&#x27;Sullivan.

==Mechanics of the game==

===Character points===
A character in &quot;GURPS&quot; is built with character points. For a beginning character in an average power game, the 4th edition suggests 100–150 points to modify attribute stats, select advantages and disadvantages, and purchase levels in skills. Normal NPCs are built on 25–50 points. Full-fledged heroes usually have 150–250 points, while superheroes are commonly built with 400–800 points. The highest point value recorded for a canon character in a &quot;GURPS&quot; sourcebook is 10,452 for the Harvester (p. 88) in &quot;GURPS Monsters&quot;.

In principle, a Game Master can balance the power of foes to the abilities of the player characters by comparing their relative point values.

===Attributes===
Characters in &quot;GURPS&quot; have four basic attributes:

* Strength (ST): A measure of the character&#x27;s physical power and bulk, ability to lift, carry, and do damage
* Dexterity (DX): A measure of the character&#x27;s physical agility, coordination, and manual dexterity
* Intelligence (IQ): A measure of the character&#x27;s mental capacity, acuity and sense of the world
* Health (HT): A measure of the character&#x27;s physical stamina, recovery speed, energy and vitality, ability to resist disease

Each attribute has a number rating assigned to it. Normally they begin at 10, representing typical human ability, but can go as low as 1 for nearly useless, to 20 (or higher) for superhuman power. Anything in the 8 to 12 range is considered to be in the &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;average&quot; area for humans. Basic attribute scores of 6 or less are considered &quot;crippling&quot;—they are so far below the human norm that they are only used for severely handicapped characters. Scores of 15 or more are described as &quot;amazing&quot;—they are immediately apparent and draw constant comment.

Players assign these ratings spending character points. The higher the rating the more points it will cost the player, however, assigning a score below the average 10 gives the player points back to assign elsewhere. Since almost all skills are based on Dexterity or Intelligence, those attributes are twice as expensive (or yield twice the points, if purchased below 10). In earlier editions (pre–4th Edition) all attributes followed the same cost-progression, where higher attributes cost more per increase than attributes close to the average of 10.

Attribute scores also determine several &quot;secondary characteristics&quot;. The four major ones are each directly based on a single attribute:

*Hit Points (HP): how much damage and injury can be sustained, based on &quot;ST&quot; in 4e. In previous editions it was based on HT.
*Will (Will): mental focus and strength, withstanding stress, based on &quot;IQ&quot;.
*Perception (Per): general sensory alertness, based on &quot;IQ&quot;.
*Fatigue Points (FP): a measure of exertion, tiredness, and hunger, based on &quot;HT&quot; in 4e. In previous editions it was based on ST.

The other secondary characteristics (Damage, Basic Lift, Basic Speed, Dodge, Move) are calculated from one or more attribute values using individual tables or formulae.

=== Character advantages and disadvantages ===
&quot;GURPS&quot; has a profusion of advantages and disadvantages which enable players or Game Masters to customize their characters. The myriad options available and the rewards the system provides players for carefully creating their characters are attractive to gamers who enjoy a high degree of flexibility in character design.

A player can select numerous Advantages and Disadvantages to differentiate the character; the system supports both mundane traits (such as above-average or below-average Wealth, Status and Reputation) as well as more exotic special abilities and weaknesses. These are categorized as physical, mental or social, and as exotic, supernatural, or mundane. Advantages benefit the character and cost points to purchase. Selecting Disadvantages returns character points and allows players to limit their characters in one way in exchange for being more powerful or gifted in other areas. Disadvantages include such positive attributes as honesty and truthfulness which limit the way a character is played. There are also many Perks and Quirks to choose from which give a character some personality. Perks (minor Advantages) and Quirks (minor Disadvantages) benefit or hinder the character a bit, but they mostly add role-playing flavor.

Enhancements and limitations can tailor an advantage or disadvantage to suit creative players. These modify the effects and point cost of advantages and disadvantages. For example, to create a &quot;dragon&#x27;s breath&quot; attack, a player would select the Innate Attack ability (the ability that allows a player to perform an attack most humans could not), and select burning attack 4D (normally 20 points). Then, the player would modify it as follows: cone, 5 yards (+100%); limited use, 3/day (-20%); reduced range, x1/5 (-20%). The final percentage modifier would be +60%, making the final cost 32 points. This addition to the system greatly increases its flexibility while decreasing the number of specific advantages and disadvantages that must be listed. Finally, &quot;mitigators&quot; can themselves tailor advantages and disadvantages (see &quot;GURPS Bio-Tech&quot; for such an example).

===Skills===
&quot;GURPS&quot; has a wide variety of skills intended to enable it to support any conceivable genre (such as Acrobatics and Vehicle Piloting). Each skill is tied to at least one attribute, and the characters&#x27; abilities in that skill is a function of their base attributes + or - a certain amount.

The availability of skills depends on the particular genre in which the &quot;GURPS&quot; game is played. For instance, in a generic medieval fantasy setting, skills for operating a computer or flying a fighter jet would not normally be available. Skills are rated by level, and the more levels purchased with character points, the better the characters are at that particular skill relative to their base attribute.

Skills are categorized by difficulty: Easy, Average, Hard, and Very Hard. Easy skills cost few points to purchase levels in, and the cost per skill level increases with each level of difficulty. Game mechanics allow that eventually it may be less expensive to raise the level of the base attribute the skills depend on as opposed to purchasing higher levels of skills. Players can generally purchase a skill for their characters at any level they can afford. The lower a player chooses, the fewer points it costs to buy the skill, while higher levels cost more points. Some skills have default levels, which indicate the level rating a character has when using that skill untrained (i.e. not purchased). For example, a character with a Dexterity of 12, is using the Climbing skill untrained. Climbing has a default of DX-5 or ST-5, which means that using the skill untrained gives him a Climbing skill level of 7 (12–5) if he tied it to the Dexterity stat. If the character had a higher Strength stat, he could have a better chance of success if he tied the Climbing skill there instead.

Some skills also have a Tech Level (TL) rating attached to them, to differentiate between Skills that concern similar concepts, but whose tasks are accomplished in different ways when used with differing levels of technology. This helps during time traveling scenarios, or when characters are forced to deal with particularly outdated or advanced equipment. For instance, a modern boat builder&#x27;s skills will be of less use if he is stuck on a desert island and forced to work with primitive tools and techniques. Thus, the skills he uses are different when in his shop (Shipbuilding/TL8) and when he is on the island (Shipbuilding/TL0).

===Success rolls===
&quot;GURPS&quot; uses six-sided dice for all game mechanics using standard dice notation. An &quot;average roll&quot; of three six sided dice generates a total of 10.5; this makes an &quot;average&quot; skill check (a skill of 10, based on an unmodified attribute) equally likely to succeed or fail.

Making statistic and skill checks in &quot;GURPS&quot; is the reverse of the mechanics of most other RPGs, where the higher the total of the die roll, the better. &quot;GURPS&quot; players hope to roll as low as possible under the tested statistic&#x27;s rating or skill&#x27;s level. If the roll is less than or equal to that number, the check succeeds. There is no &quot;target number&quot; or &quot;difficulty rating&quot; set by the Game Master, as would be the case in many other RPG systems. Instead the GM will apply various modifiers to add or subtract to the skill level. In this way, positive modifiers increase the chance for success by adding to the stat or skill level the player must roll under while negative modifiers deduct from it, making things more difficult.

For example: a player makes a pick pocketing test for her character. The character has a Pickpocket skill with a level of 11. Under normal circumstances - i.e., under an &quot;average stressful situation&quot;, according to the manual - the player must roll an 11 or less for the character to succeed. If the player rolls above 11, then the character has failed the attempt at pick pocketing.

There are some exceptions for very high or low rolls, deemed criticals. No matter the level of the skill, a die roll of 18 is always a &quot;critical failure&quot;, and a roll of 3 or 4 is always a critical success (a roll of 17 is a critical failure as well, unless the character relevant skill level is 16 or more). The Game Master may decide in such cases that, in first case (a roll of 18, or 10+ over the modified skill level), the character has failed miserably and caused something disastrous to happen or, in the other case, that he or she succeeds incredibly well and gains some benefit as a result.

===Combat===
Combat in &quot;GURPS&quot; is organized in personal turns: i.e., every character gets a turn each second, and during a character&#x27;s turn he or she may take an action, such as attack or move. After all characters have taken their action, one second has elapsed. Free actions are simple actions that can be done at any time. Characters in a party have a set initiative that is entirely based upon their Basic Speed characteristic.

There are two kinds of attacks: Melee (possibly with hand-to-hand weapons, or unarmed combat) and Ranged (bows, guns, thrown weapons, some Innate Attacks, etc.). Attacks made by a character are checked against their skill with the particular weapon they carry. For instance, if a character is using a pistol, as with any other skill, it is beneficial to have a high level in the Guns skill. Like any other skill check, a player must roll equal to or less than the level of the skill to succeed. Failure means a miss, success scores a hit. Similarly, critical hits mean that the blow might inflict significantly more damage to its target; critical misses may lead to a rather unpleasant and unexpected event (such as dropping the weapon or hitting the wrong target). Attack modifiers are set by the GM when factoring in things like distance, speed and cover that make a successful strike more difficult.

After a successful attack, except in the case of a critical hit, the defender usually gets a chance to avoid the blow. This is called an Active Defense, and takes the form of a Dodge (deliberate movement out of the perceived path of the attack), Parry (attempt to deflect or intercept the attack with a limb or weapon), or Block (effort to interpose a shield or similar object between the attack and the defender&#x27;s body). Unlike many RPG systems, an Active Defense is an unopposed check, meaning that in most cases, the success of an attack has no effect on the difficulty of the defense. Dodge is based on the Basic Speed characteristic, while Parry and Block are each based on individual combat skills, such as Fencing, Karate, or Staff for Parry, and Shield or Cloak for Block. A common criticism is that characters can achieve a relatively high Active Defense value, drawing out fights considerably. The only mechanic within the system to address this is the Feint action, which if successful will place the adversary in an unfavorable position, reducing their active defense against that character only, on the subsequent turn.

Skills, advantages, and equipment, can be combined to great effect. For example, a gunslinger from the Old West is facing a foe: 
* the Combat Reflexes advantage gives a +1 on Fast-Draw attempts and prevents the gunslinger from being stunned into inaction during a surprise attack; 
* a successful Fast-Draw(Pistol) skill roll grants the results of the Ready maneuver instantly; 
* the Gunslinger advantage grants the character the benefits of the Aim maneuver instantly; 
* the Dual-Weapon Attack(Pistol) technique allows the gunslinger to fire both his guns at once without the -4 penalties.
* the Ambidextrous advantage or the Off-Hand Weapon Training Technique eliminates the -4 penalty for the weapon in the &quot;off&quot; hand.
If the gunslinger lacked these advantages, skills, and techniques, then readying, aiming, firing, aiming again, and firing again would take at least 5 seconds. If the gunslinger lacked these traits and tried to shoot two pistols at once:
* it would take 1 second to ready the pistols
* the right hand pistol would be fired with a -4 penalty
* the &quot;off&quot; hand pistol would be fired with a -8 penalty
* both attacks would lack the accuracy bonus from the aiming maneuver.

===Damage and defenses===
Damage from muscle-powered weapons, (clubs, swords, bows, etc.) is calculated based on the character&#x27;s ST rating. The weaker a character is physically, the less damage he or she is capable of inflicting with such a weapon. Purely mechanical weapons (guns, beam sabers, bombs, etc.) have a set damage value.

When damage is inflicted upon characters, it is deducted from their Hit Points, which are calculated with the Strength stat (prior to &quot;GURPS&quot; 4th Edition, Hit Points were derived from the Health stat). Like most other RPGs, a loss of hit points indicates physical harm being inflicted upon a character, which can potentially lead to death. &quot;GURPS&quot; calculates shock penalties when someone is hit, representing the impact it causes and the rush of pain that interferes with concentration. Different weapons can cause different &#x27;types&#x27; of damage, ranging from crushing (a club or mace), impaling (a spear or arrow), cutting (most swords and axes), piercing (bullets), and so on.

One peculiarity about loss of Hit Points is that in GURPS, death is not certain. While a very high amount of total HP loss will cause certain death, there are also several points at which a player must successfully roll HT, with different grades of failure indicating character death or a mortal injury.

Depending on the nature of the attack, there will sometimes be additional effects.

===Advancement===
Character advancement follows the same system as character creation. Characters are awarded character points to improve themselves at regular intervals (usually at the end of a game session or story).

GMs are free to distribute experience as they see fit. This contrasts with some traditional RPGs where players receive a predictable amount of experience for defeating foes. The book recommends providing 1-3 points for completing objectives and 1-3 points for good role-playing per game session.

Advancement can also come through study, work, or other activities, either during game play or between sessions. In general, 200 hours of study equals one character point which can be applied for the area being studied. Self-study and on the job experience take more time per character point while high tech teaching aids can reduce the time required.

Some intensive situations let a character advance quickly, as most waking hours are considered study. For instance, characters travelling through the Amazon may count every waking moment as study of jungle survival, while living in a foreign country could count as eight hours per day of language study or more.

==Licensed works==
The computer game publisher Interplay licensed &quot;GURPS&quot; as the basis for a post–nuclear war role-playing video game (&quot;Fallout&quot;) in 1995. Late in development, Interplay replaced the &quot;GURPS&quot; character-building system with their own SPECIAL System. Brian Fargo, one of the executive producers of &quot;Fallout&quot;, stated during an interview that Interplay dropped out of the licensing deal, following fundamental disagreements on the game&#x27;s content. &quot;[Jackson] was offended by the nature of the content and where it was going. ... He saw [the opening cinematic], and he just wouldn&#x27;t approve it.&quot; Jackson said &quot;I made a lot of concessions because I want to save the project&quot; and that he felt &quot;all the original problems could be resolved&quot;.

&quot;GURPS for Dummies&quot; (), a guidebook by Stuart J. Stuple, Bjoern-Erik Hartsfvang, and Adam Griffith, was published in 2006.

==Reception==
Marcus L. Rowland reviewed &quot;GURPS&quot; in 1986 for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #83, and stated that &quot;While I can applaud the idea behind the system, I can&#x27;t really recommend &quot;GURPS&quot; at its present stage of development. In the long run, &quot;GURPS&quot; and all its supplements may cover more ground than other systems, possibly at less expense, but in the short term there isn&#x27;t enough support material to run a fully rounded game of any type, apart from gladiatorial combat and medieval adventures.&quot;

&quot;The Games Machine&quot; reviewed &quot;GURPS&quot; and stated that &quot;If the idea of a generic system appeals, or you want a straightforward set of rules with which to run adventures in a setting of your own making, &quot;GURPS&quot; is worth a look.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan called &quot;GURPS&quot; &quot;an ambitious design by Steve Jackson that attempts to cover every imaginable genre, setting and character type in the same game. That it achieves this goal at all is impressive; that it does so with imagination, elegance, and innovation is stunning.&quot; Swan liked the &quot;slick mechanics&quot;, and called the game &quot;a model of organization and presentation.&quot; Swan concluded by giving this game a top rating of 4 out of 4, saying, &quot;Though it&#x27;s amazing that a game so all-encompassing is this smooth, it&#x27;s not intended for beginners. Experienced players, however, owe it to themselves to investigate this landmark design — it&#x27;s possible &quot;GURPS&quot; may be the only RPG they&#x27;ll ever need.&quot;

In a 1996 reader poll conducted by the British games magazine &quot;Arcane&quot; to determine the fifty most popular role-playing games, &quot;GURPS&quot; was ranked 14th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: &quot;Based around a points system and six-sided dice, &quot;GURPS&quot; succeeds better than most &#x27;generic&#x27; games. The rules are flexible and it&#x27;s well supported – regardless of what you want to do with it, you&#x27;ll probably find a supplement with some advice and background. The game suffers from being a little too detailed at times, and can get bogged down in numbers. Still, it&#x27;s an adaptable system with some superb supplements.&quot;

Scott Taylor for &quot;Black Gate&quot; in 2013 rated &quot;GURPS&quot; as #5 in the top ten role-playing games of all time, saying &quot;&quot;GURPS&quot; is a very cool idea, especially considering it was created during a time of very hard adherence to finding a genre to fill and making a game that holds fast within it. The ability of &quot;GURPS&quot; to allow players to play in any setting with the same set of core rules captured the minds and wallets of many gaming fans during the late 1980s and is still popular today.&quot;

<text>A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, generally a state.

In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, executive, and judiciary. Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining policy. In many countries, the government has a kind of constitution, a statement of its governing principles and philosophy.

While all types of organizations have governance, the term &quot;government&quot; is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 independent national governments and subsidiary organizations.

The main types of modern political systems recognized are democracies, totalitarian regimes, and, sitting between these two, authoritarian regimes with a variety of hybrid regimes. Modern classification systems also include monarchies as a standalone entity or as a hybrid system of the main three. Historically prevalent forms of government include monarchy, aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, theocracy, and tyranny. These forms are not always mutually exclusive, and mixed governments are common. The main aspect of any philosophy of government is how political power is obtained, with the two main forms being electoral contest and hereditary succession.

==Definitions and etymology==
A government is the system to govern a state or community. The &quot;Columbia Encyclopedia&quot; defines government as &quot;a system of social control under which the right to make laws, and the right to enforce them, is vested in a particular group in society&quot;. While all types of organizations have governance, the word &quot;government&quot; is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 independent national governments on Earth, as well as their subsidiary organizations, such as state and provincial governments as well as local governments.

The word &quot;government&quot; derives from the Greek verb [] meaning &quot;to steer&quot; with a gubernaculum (rudder), the metaphorical sense being attested in the literature of classical antiquity, including Plato&#x27;s Ship of State. In British English, &quot;government&quot; sometimes refers to what&#x27;s also known as a &quot;ministry&quot; or an &quot;administration&quot;, i.e., the policies and government officials of a particular executive or governing coalition. Finally, &quot;government&quot; is also sometimes used in English as a synonym for rule or governance.

In other languages, cognates may have a narrower scope, such as the government of Portugal, which is more similar to the concept of &quot;administration&quot;.

==History==
=== Earliest governments ===
The moment and place that the phenomenon of human government developed is lost in time; however, history does record the formations of early governments. About 5,000 years ago, the first small city-states appeared. By the third to second millenniums BC, some of these had developed into larger governed areas: Sumer, ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley civilization, and the Yellow River civilization.

One reason that explains the emergence of governments includes agriculture. Since the Neolithic Revolution, agriculture has been an efficient method to create food surplus. This enabled people to specialize in non-agricultural activities. Some of them included being able to rule over others as an external authority. Others included social experimentation with diverse governance models. Both these activities formed the basis of governments. These governments gradually became more complex as agriculture supported larger and denser populations, creating new interactions and social pressures that the government needed to control. David Christian explains

Another explanation includes the need to properly manage infrastructure projects such as water infrastructure. Historically, this required centralized administration and complex social organisation, as seen in regions like Mesopotamia. However, there is archaeological evidence that shows similar successes with more egalitarian and decentralized complex societies.

=== Modern governments ===

Starting at the end of the 17th century, the prevalence of republican forms of government grew. The English Civil War and Glorious Revolution in England, the American Revolution, and the French Revolution contributed to the growth of representative forms of government. The Soviet Union was the first large country to have a Communist government. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, liberal democracy has become an even more prevalent form of government.

In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there was a significant increase in the size and scale of government at the national level. This included the regulation of corporations and the development of the welfare state.

==Political science==

=== Classification ===
In political science, it has long been a goal to create a typology or taxonomy of polities, as typologies of political systems are not obvious. It is especially important in the political science fields of comparative politics and international relations. Like all categories discerned within forms of government, the boundaries of government classifications are either fluid or ill-defined.

Superficially, all governments have an official &quot;de jure&quot; or ideal form. The United States is a federal constitutional republic, while the former Soviet Union was a federal socialist republic. However self-identification is not objective, and as Kopstein and Lichbach argue, defining regimes can be tricky, especially &quot;de facto&quot;, when both its government and its economy deviate in practice. For example, Voltaire argued that &quot;the Holy Roman Empire is neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire&quot;. In practice, the Soviet Union was a centralized autocratic one-party state under Joseph Stalin.

Identifying a form of government is also difficult because many political systems originate as socio-economic movements and are then carried into governments by parties naming themselves after those movements; all with competing political ideologies. Experience with those movements in power, and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government, can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves.

Other complications include general non-consensus or deliberate &quot;distortion or bias&quot; of reasonable technical definitions of political ideologies and associated forms of governing, due to the nature of politics in the modern era. For example: The meaning of &quot;conservatism&quot; in the United States has little in common with the way the word&#x27;s definition is used elsewhere. As Ribuffo notes, &quot;what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism&quot;; a &quot;conservative&quot; in Finland would be labeled a &quot;socialist&quot; in the United States. Since the 1950s conservatism in the United States has been chiefly associated with right-wing politics and the Republican Party. However, during the era of segregation many Southern Democrats were conservatives, and they played a key role in the conservative coalition that controlled Congress from 1937 to 1963.

===Social-political ambiguity===
Opinions vary by individuals concerning the types and properties of governments that exist. &quot;Shades of gray&quot; are commonplace in any government and its corresponding classification. Even the most liberal democracies limit rival political activity to one extent or another while the most tyrannical dictatorships must organize a broad base of support thereby creating difficulties for &quot;pigeonholing&quot; governments into narrow categories. Examples include the claims of the United States as being a plutocracy rather than a democracy since some American voters believe elections are being manipulated by wealthy Super PACs. Some consider that government is to be reconceptualised where in times of climatic change the needs and desires of the individual are reshaped to generate sufficiency for all.

==Measurement of governing==
The quality of a government can be measured by Government effectiveness index, which relates to political efficacy and state capacity.

==Forms==

Plato in his book &quot;The Republic&quot; (375 BC) divided governments into five basic types (four being existing forms and one being Plato&#x27;s ideal form, which exists &quot;only in speech&quot;):

* Aristocracy (rule by law and order, like ideal traditional &quot;benevolent&quot; kingdoms that are not tyrannical)
* Democracy (rule by pure liberty and equality, like a free citizen)
* Oligarchy (rule by wealth and market-based-ethics, like a laissez-faire capitalist state)
* Timocracy (rule by honor and duty, like a &quot;benevolent&quot; military; Sparta as an example)
* Tyranny (rule by fear, like a despot)

These five regimes progressively degenerate starting with aristocracy at the top and tyranny at the bottom.

In his &quot;Politics&quot;, Aristotle elaborates on Plato&#x27;s five regimes discussing them in relation to the government of one, of the few, and of the many. From this follows the classification of forms of government according to which people have the authority to rule: either one person (an autocracy, such as monarchy), a select group of people (an aristocracy), or the people as a whole (a democracy, such as a republic).

Thomas Hobbes stated on their classification:

===Modern basic political systems===
According to Yale professor Juan José Linz, there a three main types of political systems today: democracies,
totalitarian regimes and, sitting between these two, authoritarian regimes with hybrid regimes. Another modern classification system includes monarchies as a standalone entity or as a hybrid system of the main three. Scholars generally refer to a dictatorship as either a form of authoritarianism or totalitarianism.

===Autocracy===
An autocracy is a system of government in which supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a coup d&#x27;état or mass insurrection). Absolute monarchy is a historically prevalent form of autocracy, wherein a monarch governs as a singular sovereign with no limitation on royal prerogative. Most absolute monarchies are hereditary, however some, notably the Holy See, are elected by an electoral college (such as the college of cardinals, or prince-electors). Other forms of autocracy include tyranny, despotism, and dictatorship.

===Aristocracy===
Aristocracy is a form of government that places power in the hands of a small, elite ruling class, such as a hereditary nobility or privileged caste. This class exercises minority rule, often as a landed timocracy, wealthy plutocracy, or oligarchy.

Many monarchies were aristocracies, although in modern constitutional monarchies, the monarch may have little effective power. The term &quot;aristocracy&quot; could also refer to the non-peasant, non-servant, and non-city classes in the feudal system.

===Democracy===


Democracy is a system of government where citizens exercise power by voting and deliberation. In a direct democracy, the citizenry as a whole directly forms a participatory governing body and vote directly on each issue. In indirect democracy, the citizenry governs indirectly through the selection of representatives or delegates from among themselves, typically by election or, less commonly, by sortition. These select citizens then meet to form a governing body, such as a legislature or jury.

Some governments combine both direct and indirect democratic governance, wherein the citizenry selects representatives to administer day-to-day governance, while also reserving the right to govern directly through popular initiatives, referendums (plebiscites), and the right of recall. In a constitutional democracy the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of representative democracy, but the constitution limits majority rule, usually through the provision by all of certain universal rights, such as freedom of speech or freedom of association.

==== Republics ====
A republic is a form of government in which the country is considered a &quot;public matter&quot; (), not the private concern or property of the rulers, and where offices of states are subsequently directly or indirectly elected or appointed rather than inherited. The people, or some significant portion of them, have supreme control over the government and where offices of state are elected or chosen by elected people.

A common simplified definition of a republic is a government where the head of state is not a monarch. Montesquieu included both democracies, where all the people have a share in rule, and aristocracies or oligarchies, where only some of the people rule, as republican forms of government.

Other terms used to describe different republics include democratic republic, parliamentary republic, semi-presidential republic, presidential republic, federal republic, people&#x27;s republic, and Islamic republic.

==== Federalism ====
Federalism is a political concept in which a &quot;group&quot; of members are bound together by covenant with a governing representative head. The term &quot;federalism&quot; is also used to describe a system of government in which sovereignty is constitutionally divided between a central governing authority and constituent political units, variously called states, provinces or otherwise. Federalism is a system based upon democratic principles and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and provincial/state governments, creating what is often called a federation. Proponents are often called federalists.

== Branches ==

Governments are typically organised into distinct institutions constituting branches of government each with particular powers, functions, duties, and responsibilities. The distribution of powers between these institutions differs between governments, as do the functions and number of branches. An independent, parallel distribution of powers between branches of government is the separation of powers. A shared, intersecting, or overlapping distribution of powers is the fusion of powers.

Governments are often organised into three branches with separate powers: a legislature, an executive, and a judiciary; this is sometimes called the model. However, in parliamentary and semi-presidential systems, branches of government often intersect, having shared membership and overlapping functions. Many governments have fewer or additional branches, such as an independent electoral commission or auditory branch.

== Party system ==


Presently, most governments are administered by members of an explicitly constituted political party which coordinates the activities of associated government officials and candidates for office. In a multiparty system of government, multiple political parties have the capacity to gain control of government offices, typically by competing in elections, although the effective number of parties may be limited.

A majority government is a government by one or more governing parties together holding an absolute majority of seats in the parliament, in contrast to a minority government in which they have only a plurality of seats and often depend on a confidence-and-supply arrangement with other parties. A coalition government is one in which multiple parties cooperate to form a government as part of a coalition agreement. In a single-party government, a single party forms a government without the support of a coalition, as is typically the case with majority governments, but even a minority government may consist of just one party unable to find a willing coalition partner at the moment.

A state that continuously maintains a single-party government within a (nominally) multiparty system possesses a dominant-party system. In a (nondemocratic) one-party system a single ruling party has the (more-or-less) exclusive right to form the government, and the formation of other parties may be obstructed or illegal. In some cases, a government may have a non-partisan system, as is the case with absolute monarchy or non-partisan democracy.

== Maps ==
Democracy is the most popular form of government. More than half of the nations in the world are democracies—97 of 167, as of 2021. However, the world is becoming more authoritarian with a quarter of the world&#x27;s population under democratically backsliding governments.

<text>Gary Wayne Coleman (February 8, 1968 – May 28, 2010) was an American actor, known as a high-profile child star of the late 1970s and 1980s. Born in Zion, Illinois, Coleman grew up with his adopted parents, and a kidney disease; due to the corticosteroids and other medications used to treat it, his growth was limited to . In the mid-1970s, he appeared in commercials and acted in an episode of &quot;Medical Center&quot;. He caught the attention of a producer after acting in a pilot for a revival of &quot;The Little Rascals&quot; (1977), who decided to cast him as Arnold Jackson in the sitcom &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; (1978–1986), a role which launched Coleman into stardom. For playing the role of Arnold, he received several accolades, which include two Young Artist Awards; in 1980 for Outstanding Contribution to Youth Through Entertainment and in 1982 for Best Young Actor in a Comedy Series; and three People&#x27;s Choice Awards; a consecutive three wins for Favorite Young TV Performer from 1980 to 1983; as well as nominations for two TV Land Awards. He was rated first on a list of VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Kid Stars&quot;, and an influential child actor.

Coleman was the highest-paid child actor on television throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. During his prime, he reprised the role of Jackson in &quot;Hello, Larry&quot; (1979), &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; (1979–1980) and &quot;Silver Spoons&quot; (1982), and &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; (1985). He acted in high-profile television series such as &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; (1978), &quot;Good Times&quot; (1978), &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; (1979–1980), and &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot; (1986). He starred in the television films &quot;The Kid from Left Field&quot; (1979), &quot;Scout&#x27;s Honor&quot; (1980), &quot;The Kid with the Broken Halo&quot; (1982), &quot;The Kid with the 200 I.Q.&quot; (1983), &quot;The Fantastic World of D.C. Collins&quot; (1984), and &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; (1985). Additionally, he was the star of his own Saturday morning cartoon &quot;The Gary Coleman Show&quot; (1982). He also headlined two motion pictures, &quot;On the Right Track&quot; (1981) and &quot;Jimmy the Kid&quot; (1982), both financial successes.

Coleman struggled financially in later life; in 1989, he successfully sued his parents and business adviser over misappropriation of his assets, only to declare bankruptcy a decade later. Very few details of Coleman&#x27;s medical history have been made public, although his battles with issues such as growth deficiency, substance abuse, and depression during his life earned significant media coverage. Moving forward, a lot of his acting career consisted of him playing himself in guest appearances on television shows and films. He played roles in various television shows and films, which were rarely recurring roles. He also provided his acting talents to two video games, &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; (1997) and &quot;Postal 2&quot; (2003).

Coleman died at Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo, Utah, on May 28, 2010, aged 42. He had been admitted two days earlier after falling down the stairs at his home in Santaquin and striking his head, resulting in an epidural hematoma.

== Early life ==
Gary Wayne Coleman was born in Zion, Illinois, on February 8, 1968. He was adopted by W. G. Coleman, a fork-lift operator, and Edmonia Sue, a nurse practitioner. Due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, a kidney disease, and the corticosteroids and other medications used to treat it, his growth was limited to , and his face kept a childlike appearance even into adulthood. He underwent two unsuccessful kidney transplants in 1973 and again in 1984, and required dialysis.

== Career ==
=== 1974–1978: Early works to breakthrough ===
In 1974, Coleman&#x27;s career began when he appeared in a commercial for Harris Bank. His line (after the announcer said, &quot;You should have a Harris banker&quot;) was &quot;You should have a Hubert doll.&quot; &quot;Hubert&quot; was a stuffed lion representing the Harris bank logo. The same year, he appeared in an episode of &quot;Medical Center&quot;.

In 1977, Coleman appeared in a pilot for a revival of &quot;The Little Rascals&quot; as Stymie, which ultimately ended up not getting picked up as a series. His work on the &quot;Little Rascals&quot; pilot caught the attention of an executive, and in 1978 Coleman was cast as Arnold Jackson in &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, playing one of two black brothers from Harlem adopted by a wealthy white widower in Manhattan. After the premiere, &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; became a hit, and ran for 8 seasons, ending in 1986.

=== 1979–1986: Subsequent success ===
Coleman received recognition and praise for his work on &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;; for his role he received five Young Artist Award nominations, of which he won two, and won the People&#x27;s Choice Awards for Favorite Young TV Performer four years in a row, from 1980 to 1983. At the height of his fame on &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, he earned $100,000 per episode, and he became known by his character&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;What&#x27;chu talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout, Willis?&quot;, uttered skeptically in response to statements by his brother Willis, who was portrayed by Todd Bridges. According to Bridges&#x27; autobiography &quot;Killing Willis&quot;, Coleman was forced to work long hours on the set of &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; despite his age and debilitating health problems, which contributed to him feeling depressed and withdrawn from the rest of the cast. A Biography Channel documentary estimated that Coleman was left with a quarter of the original amount of money he received from his years on &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; after paying his parents, advisers, lawyers, and taxes. In 1989, Coleman sued his adoptive parents and former business advisor for $3.8 million for misappropriating his trust fund and won a $1.28 million judgment in 1993.

In 1978, Coleman acted in one episode of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, and two of &quot;Good Times&quot;. In 1979, Coleman made his television film debut playing the lead in &quot;The Kid from Left Field,&quot; a baseball comedy. The television film was made by NBC to enhance Coleman&#x27;s name recognition and boost his commercial value. It was the 15th highest-rated prime time show of the week, with a Nielsen rating of 21.4.

In that same year, he acted in &quot;Cosmic Whiz Kid&quot; an episode of the first season of science-fiction show &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; as a time-displaced whiz kid; and appeared later in that season, in a 1980 episode named &quot;A Blast for Buck&quot;.

In 1980, Coleman played the lead in the television film &quot;Scout&#x27;s Honor&quot;.

In 1981, Coleman made his feature film debut with the comedy &quot;On the Right Track&quot;, headlining as Lester, a young shoeshine orphan who lives in a locker in a train station, who achieves fame for having an uncanny talent for gambling on horses. Coleman&#x27;s mother explained that &quot;it was a script written some time ago for someone else, it was rewritten for Gary reconstructed for him. It was one of several ideas presented us for him. Gary has a very big love for trains, and we thought this might be a good one for him to do&quot;. Though it received a number of reviews concluding that it was sappy and capitalizing on Coleman&#x27;s TV following, many found the film charming, well written, well acted, with Coleman being a solid actor in his first lead role in a motion picture. The film was a financial success, it grossed 13 million at the box office ranking it at 61 on highest grosses of that year. On home-video rentals that film added 10 to 15 millions to their revenue.

In 1982, Coleman starred in &quot;Jimmy the Kid.&quot; The film was financially successful, but received resoundingly negative reviews, with critic Roger Ebert writing &quot;... movies like this don&#x27;t really have room for brilliant performances. They&#x27;re written by formula, cast by computer and directed by the book, and when a little spontaneity creeps in, it seems out of place.&quot;

On April 4 of that year, Coleman starred in the television film &quot;The Kid with the Broken Halo&quot;. The film served as the basis for Saturday morning cartoon &quot;The Gary Coleman Show,&quot; which started that year on September 11, where Coleman had the lead voice role as Andy LeBeau, an angel in training who comes to earth to help others and gain his wings.

Finally in 1982, Coleman played Arnold Jackson in a crossover episode of &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;.

Moving forward, Coleman played the lead in the comedic television films &quot;The Kid with the 200 I.Q.&quot; (1983), and &quot;The Fantastic World of D.C. Collins&quot; (1984).

In 1985, Coleman played a teenage arsonist in the television film &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;, it was his first dramatic project.

In 1986, Coleman hosted the made-for-home video educational film &quot;Gary Coleman: For Safety&#x27;s Sake&quot;, in it Coleman provides various safety advice around a home.

=== 1987–2010: Hiatus and return to acting ===
When &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; ended Coleman went on a hiatus and like his Diff’rent Strokes co-stars struggled with finding acting roles.

From thereon, the majority of Coleman&#x27;s adult roles were single appearances in television episodes. He played himself in &quot;The Ben Stiller Show, The Jackie Thomas Show, Sherman Oaks, The Parent &#x27;Hood, The Wayans Bros., The Naked Truth, Shasta McNasty, The Simpsons, My Wife and Kids, The Hughleys, Baby Bob, The Parkers,&quot; and &quot;Drake &amp; Josh.&quot; Shows where he played a character were &quot;227&quot;, &quot;Martin&quot;, &quot;Unhappily Ever After&quot;, &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; (his last appearance as Arnold Jackson), &quot;Married... with Children&quot;,&quot;Homeboys in Outer Space&quot;, &quot;The Jamie Foxx Show&quot;, &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, &quot;The Rerun Show&quot;, &quot;Son of the Beach&quot;, and &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;.

Coleman also played roles in television films these are &quot;Like Father, Like Santa&quot; (1998), &quot;A Carol Christmas&quot; (2003), and &quot;A Christmas Too Many&quot; (2006).

In films, Coleman played himself in &quot;S.F.W.&quot; (1994), &quot;Dirty Work&quot; (1998), &quot;Shafted!&quot; (2000), &quot;The Flunky&quot; (2000), &quot;Frank McKlusky, C.I.&quot; (2002), &quot;Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star&quot; (2003), &quot;The Great Buck Howard&quot; (2008), and &quot;Midgets vs. Mascots&quot; (2009). Films where he played a different character were &quot;Fox Hunt&quot; (1997), &quot;Church Ball&quot; (2006), and &quot;An American Carol&quot; (2008).

From 1996 to 1997, Coleman had a recurring role as the voice of Kevin in the animated show &quot;Waynehead&quot;.

In 1997, Coleman voiced Kenny Falmouth in the video game &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;, which gained him attention, being one of the first few major mainstream actors to appear in a video game. The adventure game was critically acclaimed, considered one of the best of its genre and has a strong legacy due to its feel, graphics, and voice acting. Jeff Green of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; gave it a rave review and that Coleman &quot;played wonderfully&quot; a &quot;shifty character.&quot;

Coleman ventured into politics, and in the 2003 California recall election he was a candidate for governor. His campaign was sponsored by the free newsweekly &quot;East Bay Express&quot; as a satirical comment on the recall. After Arnold Schwarzenegger declared his candidacy, Coleman announced that he would vote for Schwarzenegger. Coleman placed 8th in a field of 135 candidates, receiving 14,242 votes.In 2003, Coleman portrayed a fictional version of himself in the video game &quot;Postal 2, t&quot;he second game in the &quot;Postal&quot; franchise. Upon its release, the game received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot; according to review aggregator website Metacritic. Over time, it gained a cult following.

In 2005, Coleman appeared in John Cena&#x27;s music video for his single &quot;Bad, Bad Man&quot; (from the album &quot;You Can&#x27;t See Me&quot;) and played himself as a villain taking Michael Jackson and Madonna hostage. The video was a spoof of 1980s culture, focusing on &quot;The A-Team&quot;.

Coleman&#x27;s final television role was a voice role in the animated series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Coleman was an avid railroad fan, and he later worked part-time at Denver-area, Tucson-area, and California hobby stores to be around his hobby. Coleman built and maintained miniature railroads in his homes in several states throughout the 1990s. Currently, at least one of Coleman&#x27;s model railroads is being preserved in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In a 1993 television interview, Coleman said he had twice attempted suicide by overdosing on pills. Coleman lived in Santaquin, a small town about south of Salt Lake City, Utah, from 2005 until his death.

In early 2007, Coleman met Shannon Price, 22, on the set of the film &quot;Church Ball&quot;, where she was working as an extra. Price and Coleman married several months later. On May 1 and 2, 2008, they made a well-publicized appearance on the show &quot;Divorce Court&quot; to air their differences in an attempt to save their marriage. However, they divorced in August 2008, and Coleman was granted an &quot;ex parte&quot; restraining order against Price to prevent her from living in his home when he was hospitalized after their divorce. According to a court petition later filed by Price, she and Coleman continued to live together in a common-law marriage until his death. However, a judge ultimately ruled against Price after hearing testimony that she engaged in love affairs with other men during the time when she claimed to have been with Coleman, and &quot;physically abused Coleman in public, led him around by the hand like a child [and] displayed no physical affection toward him in front of anyone.&quot;

=== Legal issues ===
In 1998, Coleman was charged with assault against Tracy Fields, a Los Angeles bus driver and fan of Coleman&#x27;s work on &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; who had approached him in a California mall and requested his autograph while he was shopping for a bulletproof vest. When Coleman gave her an autograph but refused to personalize it, an argument ensued, and Fields reportedly mocked Coleman&#x27;s acting career. Coleman then punched Fields in the face in front of witnesses. He was arrested and later defended himself in court, alleging that he felt threatened by Fields. He said: &quot;She wouldn&#x27;t leave me alone. I was getting scared, and she was getting ugly.&quot; Coleman pleaded no contest to one count of assault, received a suspended jail sentence and was ordered to pay Fields&#x27; $1,665 hospital bill and to take anger management classes.

In 2007, Coleman was cited for misdemeanor disorderly conduct in Provo, Utah, after a &quot;heated discussion&quot; in public with his wife, Shannon Price. In 2009, Coleman and his ex-wife were involved in a domestic dispute, after which Price was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, and both parties were cited for disorderly conduct.

In 2008, Coleman was involved in an altercation at a Payson, Utah, bowling alley, which began when Colt Rushton, age 24, photographed Coleman without his permission. The two men argued, according to witnesses. In the parking lot, Coleman allegedly backed his truck into Rushton, striking his knee and pulling him under the vehicle, before hitting another car. Rushton was treated at a local hospital for minor injuries and released. Coleman later pleaded no contest to charges of disorderly conduct and reckless driving and was fined $100. In 2010, he settled a civil suit related to the incident for an undisclosed amount. Months before his death in 2010, Coleman was arrested on an outstanding domestic assault warrant in Santaquin, booked into the Utah County Jail and released the following day.

=== Financial problems ===
In August 1999, Coleman filed for bankruptcy protection. He claimed that multiple people were responsible for his insolvency, &quot;from me, to accountants, to my adoptive parents, to agents, to lawyers, and back to me again.&quot; He lost $200,000 on an arcade that he had named the Gary Coleman Game Parlor, which was located at Fisherman&#x27;s Village in Marina del Rey, California. Ongoing medical expenses contributed significantly to Coleman&#x27;s chronic financial problems and sometimes compelled him to resort to unusual fundraising activities. In 1999, he partnered with UGO Networks for an online auction titled &quot;Save Me!&quot;. Items included his couch, a &quot;tiny pimp suit&quot; with matching gold Nikes and an autographed ice scraper. Items attracted more than $5,000 in bids.

== Health problems and death ==
In 2009, Coleman underwent heart surgery. Although the details of the procedure were never made public, he is known to have developed postoperative pneumonia. In January 2010, Coleman was hospitalized after a seizure in Los Angeles, and in February, he experienced another seizure on the set of &quot;The Insider&quot; television program. On May 26, 2010, Coleman was admitted to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo, Utah, in critical condition after falling down the stairs at his Santaquin home and hitting his head, possibly after another seizure, and experiencing an epidural hematoma. According to a hospital spokesman, Coleman was conscious and lucid the next morning, but his condition subsequently worsened. By mid-afternoon on May 27, he was unconscious and on life support. He died at 12:05 pm MDT on May 28, 2010, at age 42.

The weekend after Coleman&#x27;s death, a scheduled funeral was postponed and later canceled following a dispute regarding the disposition of his estate and remains among Coleman&#x27;s adoptive parents, former business associate Anna Gray and Price. Coleman&#x27;s former manager Dion Mial was initially involved but withdrew after Coleman&#x27;s 1999 will, which had named Mial as executor, was found to have been superseded by a 2005 will replacing Mial with Gray. The earlier will had stipulated that Coleman&#x27;s wake be &quot;...conducted by those with no financial ties to me and can look each other in the eyes and say they really cared personally for Gary Coleman&quot;, but the later version directed &quot;...that there be no funeral service, wake, or other ceremony memorializing my passing.&quot;

=== Aftermath ===
Questions were raised as to whether Price, who approved discontinuing Coleman&#x27;s life support, was legally authorized to do so. The controversy was exacerbated by a photograph published on the front page of the tabloid newspaper &quot;Globe&quot; depicting Price posed next to a comatose, intubated Coleman under the headline, &quot;It Was Murder!&quot; While Coleman&#x27;s final will named Gray as executor and awarded his entire estate to her, Coleman and Price married in 2007. Although she had divorced Coleman in 2008, Price claimed in a court petition that she had remained his common-law wife, with the two sharing bank accounts and presenting themselves publicly as husband and wife until Coleman&#x27;s death. Her assertion, if validated by the court, would have made her his lawful heir.

In May 2012, judge James Taylor stated that while Price had indeed lived in Coleman&#x27;s home after their marriage ended, their relationship at the time of his death failed to meet Utah&#x27;s standard for a common-law marriage. The hospital later issued a statement confirming that Coleman had completed an advance healthcare directive granting Price permission to make medical decisions on his behalf. An investigation by Santaquin police was closed on October 5, 2010, after the medical examiner ruled Coleman&#x27;s death accidental and no evidence of wrongdoing could be demonstrated. The disposition of Coleman&#x27;s ashes remains unknown. Price said that had she been granted disposition, she would have scattered the ashes at the Golden Spike National Historic Site in Utah as a tribute to Coleman&#x27;s lifelong love of trains.

== Legacy ==
Coleman is frequently listed as one of the most influential child actors in the world. He was rated first on a list of VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Kid Stars&quot; on television, and was noted by MTV for having an &quot;Undeniable Impact on Pop Culture.&quot; Mike Hogan from &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; wrote on his career, saying &quot;He was unquestionably a superstar, overshadowing them with his radiant charisma and boundless energy, but the kidney condition that enabled him, even as a teen, to play the world&#x27;s most precocious little brother on TV also complicated his life in ways most of us will never understand.&quot; Actress Lucille Ball stated in a 1980 interview with &quot;People&quot; magazine that although she rarely watched sitcoms, &quot;I love Gary Coleman. He puts me away. He puts everybody away.&quot;

Filk music act Ookla the Mok paid tribute to Coleman on their 2003 album &quot;oh okay LA&quot; with the song &quot;A.M. Suicide.&quot; He is parodied in &quot;Avenue Q&quot;, which won the 2004 Tony Award for Best Musical; a fictionalized version of him works as the superintendent of the apartment complex where the musical takes place. In the song &quot;It Sucks to Be Me&quot;, he laments his fate. On Broadway, the role was originally performed by Natalie Venetia Belcon. The show&#x27;s creators, Jeff Marx and Robert Lopez, have said the Coleman character personifies one of &quot;Avenue Q&quot; central themes: that as children we are told we are &quot;special&quot;, but upon entering adulthood, we discover that life is not nearly as easy as we have been led to believe. They added that their original intent was for Coleman himself to play the Gary Coleman role, and he expressed interest in it but did not show up for a meeting scheduled to discuss it. In 2005, Coleman announced his intention to sue the producers of &quot;Avenue Q&quot; for their depiction of him, although the lawsuit never materialized. At the 2007 New York Comic Con, Coleman said, &quot;I wish there was a lawyer on Earth that would sue them for me.&quot;

Following his death in 2010, the casts of the off-Broadway production of &quot;Avenue Q&quot; in New York City and the &quot;Avenue Q&quot; National Tour in Dallas dedicated their performances to his memory, and the actors playing the part of Coleman paid tribute to him from the stage at the performances&#x27; conclusions. The Coleman character remained in the show after modifications were made to relevant dialogue. Randy Kester—Coleman&#x27;s attorney—told &quot;Dallas News&quot; in 2010, &quot;The world&#x27;s going to be a little less happy place without Gary. For being a small guy, he sure had a big impact on the world.&quot; Coleman appeared in 2011 in the game&#x27;s intro &quot;Postal III&quot; and in 2015 in the expansion pack for &quot;Postal 2&quot; - &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. In the 2021 &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; special, actor Kevin Hart played Coleman&#x27;s signature character of Arnold Jackson.

A documentary about Coleman&#x27;s life, &quot;Gary&quot;, was released on the streaming service Peacock on August 29, 2024.

== Works and awards ==

Throughout his career, Coleman had garnered over sixty acting credits and over eighty television appearances. For playing the role of Arnold Jackson in the sitcom &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; (1978–1986), he received several accolades, which include two Young Artist Awards and three People&#x27;s Choice Awards—the latter being a consecutive three wins for Favorite Young TV Performer from 1980 to 1983—and nominations for two TV Land Awards.

<doc id="12231" wikidata="Q216288" url="?curid=12231" title="Garth Brooks">
<text>Troyal Garth Brooks (born February 7, 1962) is an American country singer and songwriter. His integration of pop and rock elements into the country genre has earned him his immense popularity, particularly in the United States, with success on the country music single and album charts, multi-platinum recordings and record-breaking live performances, while also crossing over into the mainstream pop arena.

Brooks is the only artist in music history to have released nine albums that were certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (surpassing The Beatles&#x27; former record of six); those albums are &quot;Garth Brooks&quot; (diamond), &quot;No Fences&quot; (17× platinum), &quot;Ropin&#x27; the Wind&quot; (14× platinum), &quot;The Chase&quot; (diamond), &quot;In Pieces&quot; (diamond), &quot;The Hits&quot; (diamond), &quot;Sevens&quot; (diamond), &quot;Double Live&quot; (21× platinum), and &quot;The Ultimate Hits&quot; (diamond). Since 1989, Brooks has released 27 records in all, which include 17 studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three Christmas albums, and four box sets, along with 77 singles. He has won several awards in his career, including two Grammy Awards, 17 American Music Awards (including &quot;Artist of the &#x27;90s&quot;) and the RIAA Award for best-selling solo albums artist of the century in the U.S.

Troubled by conflicts between career and family, Brooks retired from recording and performing from 2001 until 2005. During this time, he sold millions of albums through an exclusive distribution deal with Walmart and sporadically released new singles. In 2005, Brooks started a partial comeback, giving select performances and releasing two compilation albums. In 2009, he began Garth at Wynn, a periodic weekend concert residency at Las Vegas&#x27;s Encore Theatre from December 2009 to January 2014. Following the conclusion of the residency, Brooks announced his signing with Sony Music Nashville in July 2014. In September 2014, he began his comeback world tour, with wife and musician Trisha Yearwood, which culminated in 2017. This was followed by his Stadium Tour, which began in 2019, and another Las Vegas concert residency, Garth Brooks/Plus ONE, continuing into 2024. His most recent album, &quot;Time Traveler&quot;, was released in November 2023.

Brooks is one of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists, having sold more than 170 million records. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Brooks as the greatest male solo artist on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart of all time. , according to the RIAA, he is the best-selling solo albums artist in the United States with 162 million domestic units sold, ahead of Elvis Presley, and is second only to the Beatles in total album sales overall. Brooks was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on October 21, 2012, having been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame the year before. He was also inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2016 with his studio musicians, The G-Men. In 2020, Brooks became the youngest recipient of the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song.

==Early life and education==
Troyal Garth Brooks was born on February 7, 1962, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was the youngest child of Troyal Raymond Brooks Jr. (1931–2010), a draftsman for an oil company, and Colleen McElroy Carroll (1929–1999), a 1950s-era country singer of Irish ancestry who recorded on the Capitol Records label and appeared on &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot;. This was the second marriage for each of his parents, giving Brooks four older half-siblings (Jim, Jerry, Mike, and Betsy). The couple had two children together, Kelly and Garth. At their home in Yukon, Oklahoma, the family hosted weekly talent nights. All of the children were required to participate, either by singing or doing skits. Brooks learned to play both the guitar and banjo.

As a child, Brooks often sang in casual family settings, but his primary focus was athletics. In high school, he played football and baseball and ran track and field. He received a track scholarship to Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, where he competed in the javelin. At nights, he worked as a bouncer at a local bar and formed his own band, Santa Fe, learning to play whatever the college audience wanted. Brooks graduated in 1984 with a degree in advertising. His roommate, Ty England, later played guitar in his road band until going solo in 1995.

==Career==
===1985–1989: Musical beginnings===
In 1985, Brooks began his professional music career, singing and playing guitar in Oklahoma clubs and bars, most notably Wild Willie&#x27;s Saloon in Stillwater. Through his elder siblings, Brooks was exposed to a wide range of music. Although he listened to some country music, especially that of George Jones, Brooks was most fond of rock music, citing James Taylor, Dan Fogelberg, and Townes Van Zandt as major influences. In 1981, after hearing &quot;Unwound&quot;, the debut single of George Strait, Brooks decided that he was more interested in playing country music.

In 1985, entertainment attorney Rod Phelps drove from Dallas to listen to Brooks. Phelps liked what he heard and offered to produce Brooks&#x27; first demo. With Phelps&#x27; encouragement, including a list of Phelps&#x27; contacts in Nashville and some of his credit cards, Brooks traveled to Nashville to pursue a recording contract; he returned to Oklahoma within 24 hours. Phelps continued to urge Brooks to return to Nashville, which he did. In 1987, Brooks and wife Sandy Mahl moved to Nashville, and Brooks began making contacts in the music industry.

===1989–1990: Breakthrough success===
Garth Brooks&#x27; eponymous first album was released in 1989 and was a chart success. It peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart, and reached No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Most of the album was traditionalist country, influenced in part by George Strait. The first single, &quot;Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)&quot;, was a country top 10 success. It was followed by Brooks&#x27; first number-one single on the Hot Country Songs chart, &quot;If Tomorrow Never Comes&quot;. &quot;Not Counting You&quot; reached No. 2, and &quot;The Dance&quot; reached No. 1; its music video, directed by John Lloyd Miller, gave Brooks his first push towards a broader audience. Brooks has later claimed that out of all the songs he has recorded, &quot;The Dance&quot; remains his favorite. In 1989, Brooks embarked on his first major concert tour, as opening act for Kenny Rogers.

Brooks&#x27; second album, &quot;No Fences&quot;, was released in 1990 and spent 23 weeks at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart. The album also reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and eventually became Brooks&#x27; highest-selling album, with domestic shipments of 17 million. It contained what would become Brooks&#x27; signature song, the blue collar anthem &quot;Friends in Low Places&quot;, as well as other popular singles, &quot;The Thunder Rolls&quot; and &quot;Unanswered Prayers&quot;.

Each of these songs, as well as &quot;Two of a Kind, Workin&#x27; on a Full House&quot;, reached No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart.
While Brooks&#x27; musical style placed him squarely within the boundaries of country music, he was strongly influenced by the 1970s singer-songwriter movement, especially the works of James Taylor, whom he idolized and named his first child after, as well as Dan Fogelberg. Similarly, Brooks was influenced by the 1970s-era rock of Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen and the operatic rock of Queen with Freddie Mercury.

In his live shows, Brooks used a wireless headset microphone to free himself to run about the stage, adding energy and arena rock theatrics to spice up the normally staid country music approach to concerts. The band KISS was also one of Brooks&#x27; early musical influences, and his shows often reflect this. Despite all the cited influences, Brooks stated the energetic style of his stage persona is directly inspired by Chris LeDoux.

In late 1990, Brooks was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry.

===1991–1993: &quot;Ropin&#x27; the Wind&quot;, &quot;The Chase&quot;, and &quot;Beyond the Season&quot;===
Brooks&#x27; third album, &quot;Ropin&#x27; the Wind&quot;, was released in September 1991. It had advance orders of 4 million copies and entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 1, a first for a country artist. The album&#x27;s musical content was a melange of country pop and honky-tonk; singles included &quot;The River&quot;, &quot;What She&#x27;s Doing Now&quot;, and a cover of Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;Shameless&quot;. It would become Brooks&#x27; second-best selling album, after &quot;No Fences&quot;. The success of &quot;Ropin&#x27; the Wind&quot; further propelled the sales of Brooks&#x27; first two albums, enabling Brooks to become the first country artist with three albums listed in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200&#x27;s top 20 in one week.

After spending time in Los Angeles during the 1992 riots, Brooks co-wrote a gospel-country-rock hybrid single, &quot;We Shall Be Free&quot;, to express his desire for tolerance. The song became the first single off his fourth album &quot;The Chase&quot;. The single only reached No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Singles chart, Brooks&#x27; first song in three years to fail to make the top 10. Nonetheless, &quot;We Shall Be Free&quot; peaked at No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Christian Songs charts through a marketing deal with Rick Hendrix Company, and earned Brooks a 1993 GLAAD Media Award. The next single released from &quot;The Chase&quot; was &quot;Somewhere Other Than the Night&quot;, followed by &quot;Learning to Live Again&quot;, which peaked at numbers one and two on the Hot Country Songs chart, respectively. The album&#x27;s final single, &quot;That Summer&quot;, would go on to be the most successful single from the album, reaching No. 1 in July 1993.

Brooks released his first Christmas album, &quot;Beyond the Season&quot; on August 25, 1992. The album included classics such as &quot;White Christmas&quot; and &quot;Silent Night&quot;, as well as an original tune, &quot;The Old Man&#x27;s Back in Town&quot;. &quot;Beyond the Season&quot; was the best-selling Christmas album in 1992, peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart.

===1993–1994: &quot;In Pieces&quot; and first world tour===

In 1993, Brooks, who had criticized music stores selling used CDs since it led to a loss in proper royalty payments, persuaded Capitol Records to not ship his 1993 album, &quot;In Pieces&quot;, to stores which engaged in this practice. This led to several antitrust lawsuits against the record label, ending with Capitol shipping the albums to the stores.

Despite the delay in shipping, &quot;In Pieces&quot; was another success, peaking at No. 1 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top Country Albums charts, and selling a total of nearly 10 million copies. After a delay in its worldwide release, the album also peaked at No. 2 on the United Kingdom Albums Chart. That same year, &quot;The Red Strokes&quot; became Brooks&#x27; first single to make the UK Singles Chart, reaching a high of No. 13; it was followed by &quot;Standing Outside the Fire&quot;, which reached No. 23. Previous albums &quot;No Fences&quot;, &quot;Ropin&#x27; the Wind&quot; and &quot;The Chase&quot; also remained in the top 30 in the UK Albums Chart.

Brooks&#x27; first world tour began in 1993, reaching the UK after many domestic concerts. Brooks sold-out venues such as Birmingham&#x27;s National Exhibition Centre and London&#x27;s Wembley Arena, a feat never accomplished by an American country music artist. He also began the London radio station, Country 1035. Despite the disdain of the British media, Brooks&#x27; overall popularity in the country was evident, with a top disc jockey, Nick Barraclough, referring to Brooks as Garth Vader (a play on Darth Vader) for his &quot;invasion&quot; of the charts and his success in the country genre. Unlike Alan Jackson, who refused to return to the UK after being treated in a similar negative manner by the press, Brooks would later return in 1996 for more performances. Brooks also took his World Tour to other regions throughout Europe, as well as Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand.

In 1994, Brooks paid homage to one of his musical influences, KISS, appearing on the tribute compilation, &quot;Kiss My Ass: Classic Kiss Regrooved,&quot; a collection of songs performed by popular artists from various genres. The unlikely collaboration of Brooks and KISS&#x27; rendition of &quot;Hard Luck Woman&quot; was performed live on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, and despite its hard-rock appeal, Brooks&#x27; version appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart.

===1995–1998: More albums released and second world tour===

In November 1995, Brooks released &quot;Fresh Horses&quot;, his first album of new material in two years. Within six months of its release, the album had sold over three million copies. Despite its promising start, &quot;Fresh Horses&quot; plateaued quickly, topping out at quadruple platinum.
The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;She&#x27;s Every Woman&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart; however, its follow-up single, &quot;The Fever&quot; (an Aerosmith cover) only peaked at No. 23, becoming Brooks&#x27; first country single to not chart on the top 10. However, Brooks had three additional top 10 singles from the album, including &quot;The Beaches of Cheyenne&quot;, which reached No. 1.

Following the release of &quot;Fresh Horses&quot;, Brooks embarked on his second world tour. Its total attendance, approximately 5.5 million, ranks third on the all-time list of concert attendance, and its gross of over $105 million ranks it among the highest-grossing concert tours in the 1990s.

In 1997, Brooks released his seventh studio album, &quot;Sevens&quot;. The album was originally scheduled to be released in August 1997, allowing for promotion during Brooks&#x27; ; however, plans went awry after a dispute within Capitol Records. The Central Park concert went on as planned, receiving 980,000 fans in attendance and becoming the largest concert in park history.

&quot;Sevens&quot; debuted at No. 1 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top Country Albums charts. It later became Brooks&#x27; fourth album to reach sales of 10 million copies. The album included the duet &quot;In Another&#x27;s Eyes&quot; with Trisha Yearwood, which reached No. 2 on Hot Country Songs chart, and its first single, &quot;Longneck Bottle&quot;, with Steve Wariner, reached No. 1. The album spawned two additional number-one singles, &quot;Two Pina Coladas&quot; and &quot;To Make You Feel My Love&quot; (a Bob Dylan cover), which also was a top 10 hit on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart and was released on the soundtrack to the film, &quot;Hope Floats&quot;.

Brooks&#x27; first live album, &quot;Double Live&quot; was released in 1998. Recorded at various shows over the course of his second world tour, the album contained new material not previously released, such as &quot;Tearin&#x27; It Up (and Burnin&#x27; It Down)&quot; and &quot;Wild as the Wind,&quot; featuring Trisha Yearwood. Peaking at No. 1 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top Country Albums charts, &quot;Double Live&quot; went on to become the best-selling live album of all time, certified 21× Platinum by the RIAA, and is the seventh-most shipped album in United States music history.

In 1998, Brooks also released the first installment of &quot;The Limited Series&quot;, a six-disc box set containing reissues of his first six studio albums. Each of the reissued albums included a bonus track not available on the original release.

===1999: &quot;Chris Gaines&quot; and holiday album===

In 1999, Brooks took on the persona of &quot;Chris Gaines&quot;, a fictitious rock-and-roll musician and character for an upcoming film titled &quot;The Lamb&quot;. In September 1999, the film&#x27;s pre-release soundtrack, &quot;Garth Brooks in...the Life of Chris Gaines&quot; (also dubbed Gaines&#x27; &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;), was released to much public criticism. Brooks also appeared as Gaines in a television mockumentary for the VH1 series &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, and as the musical guest on an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, which he also hosted as himself.

Brooks&#x27; promotion of the album and the film did not garner excitement, and the failure of the Gaines project was evident mere weeks after the album was released. The majority of the American public was either bewildered, or completely unreceptive to the idea of Brooks portraying a rock-and-roll musician. Sales of the album were unspectacular, at least compared with most of Brooks&#x27; previous albums, and although it made it to No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, expectations had been higher and retail stores began heavily discounting their oversupply. Less-than-expected sales of the album (more than two million) brought the project to an indefinite hiatus in February 2001 and Gaines quickly faded into obscurity.

Despite the less-than-spectacular response to the Gaines project, Brooks gained his first (and only) &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 pop single in &quot;Lost in You&quot;. The album was later certified Double Platinum by the RIAA.

On November 23, 1999, Brooks released his second holiday album, &quot;Garth Brooks &amp; the Magic of Christmas&quot;. The album peaked at No. 7 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 200 and No. 1 on the Top Country Albums, making it Brooks&#x27; 10th number-one album.

===2000–2004: &quot;Scarecrow&quot; and retirement===
As his career flourished, Brooks seemed frustrated by the conflicts between career and family. He first talked of retiring from performing in 1992, and again in 1995, but each time returned to touring. In 1999, Brooks appeared on The Nashville Network&#x27;s &quot;Crook &amp; Chase&quot; program, again mentioning retirement in a more serious tone. On October 26, 2000, Brooks officially announced his retirement from recording and performing. Later that evening, Capitol Records noted Brooks&#x27; achievement of selling 100 million albums in the US, celebrating at Nashville&#x27;s Gaylord Entertainment Center.

Brooks&#x27; final album before retirement, &quot;Scarecrow&quot;, was released on November 13, 2001. The album did not match the sales levels of Brooks&#x27; heyday, but still sold well, reaching No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top Country Albums charts. Although he staged a few performances for promotional purposes, Brooks stated that he would be retired from recording and performing at least until his youngest daughter finished high school.

===2005–2008: Compilation albums and special performances===
In 2005, Brooks expressed his interest in returning to live performances; however, he remained adamant to the premise of not releasing new music until 2014. Despite this, later that year, Brooks signed a deal with Walmart, leasing them the rights to his entire catalog following his split with Capitol Records. Brooks was one of the first musicians to sign an exclusive music distribution deal with a single retailer (along with fellow country music artist Ricky Van Shelton, who issued his 1998 album &quot;Making Plans&quot; through the chain as well).

Three months later, in November 2005, Brooks and Walmart issued an updated &quot;The Limited Series&quot; compilation, a box set containing reissues of Brooks&#x27; albums, including &quot;Double Live&quot;, and &quot;The Lost Sessions&quot;, featuring eleven previously unreleased recordings. The box set sold more than 500,000 physical copies on its issue date. By the first week in December 2005, it had sold over 1 million physical copies.

Brooks took a brief break from retirement early in 2005 to perform in various benefit concerts. He also released a new single, &quot;Good Ride Cowboy&quot;, as a tribute to his late friend and country singer, Chris LeDoux, via Walmart.

In early 2006, Walmart reissued &quot;The Lost Sessions&quot; as a single CD apart from the box set, with additional songs, including a duet with Trisha Yearwood, &quot;Love Will Always Win&quot;, which reached the top 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart. The couple were later nominated for a &quot;Best Country Collaboration With Vocals&quot; Grammy Award.

On August 18, 2007, Brooks announced plans for a new box set, &quot;The Ultimate Hits&quot;. The new set featured two discs containing 30 classic songs, three new songs, and a DVD featuring music videos. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;More Than a Memory&quot;, was released on August 27, 2007. It debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart, becoming the highest-debuting single in the chart&#x27;s history.

In November 2007, Brooks embarked on Garth Brooks: Live in Kansas City, performing nine sold-out concerts in Kansas City at the Sprint Center, which had opened a month prior. Originally scheduled to be only one show, the performance expanded to nine due to incredibly high demand, with all nine shows (equaling about 140,000 tickets) selling out in under two hours. The final concert of the series was simulcast to more than 300 movie theaters across the U.S.

In January 2008, Brooks embarked on another incredible feat performing five sold-out shows (in less than 48 hours) at the Staples Center in Los Angeles for a fundraiser towards the 2007 wildfires season that impacted much of Southern California&#x27;s cities and counties. The first concert (of the five) titled Garth Brooks: Live in LA was taped and broadcast repeatedly on CBS with all donations going to all of the victims and families in state of California who were impacted by the fires.

===2009–2013: Las Vegas concert residency===

In January 2009, Brooks made another one of few public appearances since his retirement, performing at the We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial concert in Washington, D.C.. In his three-song set, Brooks performed &quot;We Shall Be Free&quot;, along with covers of Don McLean&#x27;s &quot;American Pie&quot; and The Isley Brothers &quot;Shout&quot;.

On October 15, 2009, Brooks suspended his retirement to begin Garth at Wynn, a periodic weekend concert residency at Encore Las Vegas on the Las Vegas Strip. The schedule allowed Brooks both to have the family life during the week and to continue to perform on the weekend. The financial terms of the agreement were not announced, but Steve Wynn did disclose that he gave Brooks access to a private jet to quickly transport him between Las Vegas and his home in Oklahoma.

Brooks&#x27; first weekend on shows in Vegas received positive reviews and was called the &quot;antithesis of Vegas glitz and of the country singer&#x27;s arena and stadium extravaganzas&quot; by USA Today. The shows featured Brooks performing solo, acoustic concerts, and included a set list of songs that have influenced him. Artists covered in the show include Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Bob Seger, Billy Joel, and Don McLean. His first performances at Encore Las Vegas coincided with his wedding anniversary, and his wife Trisha Yearwood joined him for two songs.

In 2013, influenced by the set list of the Las Vegas shows, Brooks released &quot;Blame It All on My Roots: Five Decades of Influences&quot; via Walmart, a compilation album consisting of songs Brooks attributes to the development of his unique country pop genre. The box set&#x27;s albums were individually certified Platinum and the compilation received a Billboard Music Award nomination. In a December 2013 appearance on Good Morning America to promote the album, Brooks also surprisingly announced plans for a world tour, beginning in 2014.

===2014–2015: &quot;Man Against Machine&quot;, GhostTunes, and world tour===

In February 2014, Brooks announced two concerts at Croke Park, Dublin, Ireland, to be held on July 25 and 26, 2014. Due to high demand, three additional shows were added, and a total of 400,000 tickets were sold. However, due to licensing conflict, Aiken Promotions and Croke Park management were prompted to cancel two of the five concerts after conflict among nearby residents. Brooks, committed to performing the five original concerts, refused to follow through with the request to only perform three, and all concerts were cancelled.

On July 10, 2014, Brooks held a press conference where he announced his signing with Sony Music Nashville, as well as confirming plans for a new album, world tour, the release of his music in a digital format, and remorse for the Ireland concert controversy. Fifteen days later, tickets first went on sale for the world tour.

On September 3, 2014, Brooks released his comeback single, &quot;People Loving People&quot;, in promotion of his world tour and new album, &quot;Man Against Machine&quot;. The song debuted onto the Nielsen BDS-driven Country Airplay chart at No. 19, tying for the third-highest debut of Brooks&#x27; career. 
On September 4, 2014, Brooks released his entire studio output on digital for the first time ever. Bypassing traditional digital music service providers, Brooks opted into releasing his albums directly his own new online music store, GhostTunes. On September 19, Brooks confirmed the release date for his next album, scheduled for November 11 via a press conference in Atlanta. &quot;Man Against Machine&quot; was released via Pearl and RCA Nashville and was available online exclusively through GhostTunes. GhostTunes closed on March 3, 2017. Brooks&#x27; digital catalogue moved to Amazon Music, who maintain exclusive rights over it.

In September 2015, it was announced Brooks would reissue his album &quot;No Fences&quot; later in the year to commemorate its 25-year release anniversary. The release would include a new version of &quot;Friends in Low Places&quot;, featuring George Strait, Jason Aldean, Florida Georgia Line, and Keith Urban singing along with Brooks. The album release has since been delayed due to royalty disputes. The track was later featured on his 2016 compilation album, &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot;.

===2016–2017: &quot;Gunslinger&quot;, &quot;Christmas Together&quot;, and online streaming===
On October 13, 2016, Brooks released the first single, &quot;Baby, Let&#x27;s Lay Down and Dance&quot;, from his upcoming album. The following week, Brooks released the upcoming album&#x27;s title, &quot;Gunslinger&quot;, via Facebook Live. It was released on November 11, 2016, as a part of &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot;, a compilation album Brooks released through Target. Brooks&#x27; other project for 2016 was a duet holiday album with wife Trisha Yearwood, &quot;Christmas Together&quot;.

After years of royalty disputes and an opposition to online music streaming, Brooks launched a streaming channel on Sirius XM Radio. He also reached an agreement to stream his entire catalogue via Amazon Music.

===2018–present: Stadium Tour and other ventures===

On June 19, 2018, Brooks released a new single, &quot;All Day Long&quot;, the first off his 2020 album, &quot;Fun&quot;. The release also included a B-side, &quot;The Road I&#x27;m On&quot;. In August 2018, Brooks announced new live album, &quot;Triple Live&quot;, to be released in partnership with Ticketmaster.

In August 2018, Brooks announced his Stadium Tour, which will visit thirty North American stadiums and showcase Brooks in a football-centric environment. In promotion of the tour, Brooks performed the first at the University of Notre Dame&#x27;s football stadium in 2018 He released the second single, &quot;Stronger Than Me&quot;, from his upcoming 2019 album release following a performance dedicated to his wife Trisha Yearwood at the CMA Awards. On August 14, 2021, he performed his largest ever ticketed concert at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Neb., selling 90,000 tickets.

The third single from his upcoming album, &quot;Dive Bar&quot;, a duet with Blake Shelton, was released in June 2019. Brooks also embarked on the Dive Bar Tour, a promotional tour in support of the single, visiting seven dive bars throughout the United States.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Brooks and wife Trisha Yearwood performed an informal concert broadcast on Facebook Live. The website crashed multiple times as an estimated 5.2 million streamed the broadcast. As a result of this, Brooks and Yearwood performed a concert in the same format the following week, broadcast live on CBS, along with a donation of $1 million to relief efforts. The CBS special scored an estimated 5.6 million viewers. On July 7, Brooks and Yearwood performed a &quot;part 2&quot; to their previous online concert, taking song requests and again broadcast on Facebook Live. On June 27, 2020, Brooks performed a concert broadcast at 300 drive-in theaters throughout North America.

Brooks released his most recent album, &quot;Fun&quot;, on November 20, 2020.

On January 20, 2021, Brooks performed &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; at the inauguration of Joe Biden. He said his performance was an opportunity &quot;to serve&quot; and is a &quot;statement of unity.&quot;

On April 30, 2022, Brooks performed in Tiger Stadium on the campus of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. When he performed his signature hit &quot;Callin&#x27; Baton Rouge,&quot; he became the second person, after LSU quarterback Tommy Hodson, to excite the crowd to a degree that the noise level registered on the university&#x27;s seismograph – registering as an earthquake caused by excited fans.

On November 14, 2022, Brooks announced his second concert residency, Garth Brooks/Plus ONE, at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. He released his most recent album, &quot;Time Traveler&quot;, in November 2023.

On November 24, 2023, Brooks headlined an &quot;Amazon Music Live&quot; concert special, &quot;Garth Brooks: Dive Bar Concert&quot;. The concert took place at Brooks&#x27; Nashville bar Friends in Low Places Bar &amp; Honky-Tonk.

On January 9, 2025, Brooks along with his wife Trisha Yearwood performed the John Lennon song &quot;Imagine&quot; at the state funeral for former President Jimmy Carter at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.

==The G-Men==
The vast majority of Brooks&#x27; recordings have used the same studio band, known collectively as the &quot;G-Men&quot;. These are Bruce Bouton (steel guitar), Mark Casstevens (acoustic guitar), Mike Chapman (bass guitar), Rob Hajacos (fiddle), Milton Sledge (drums), and Bobby Wood (keyboards), along with sound engineer Mark Miller, who took over from Allen Reynolds as Brooks&#x27; producer starting with &quot;Blame It All on My Roots: Five Decades of Influences&quot;. Chapman died on June 13, 2016.

==Other ventures==
===Professional baseball===
In 1998, Brooks launched his Touch &#x27;em All Foundation with Major League Baseball. He also began with a short career in baseball, when he signed with the San Diego Padres for spring training in 1998 and 1999. Brooks&#x27; performance on the field did not warrant management placing him on the regular season roster; however, he was offered a non-roster spot, but declined it. The following season, Brooks signed with the New York Mets. This spring-training stint was also a poor performance for Brooks, resulting in a zero-for-seventeen batting record. In 2004, Brooks returned to baseball with the Kansas City Royals. He got his first and only hit off Mike Myers during his final spring training game with the Royals.

In 2019, Brooks made a return to spring training, joining the Pittsburgh Pirates to promote his charity.

===Pearl Records===
In 2005, Brooks ended his association with Capitol Records and established his own record label, Pearl Records. Brooks has released four compilation albums via Pearl Records, as well as his 2014 and 2016 studio albums plus any future releases (also released through RCA Records Nashville).

===Allentown Studios===
In 2010, Brooks purchased Jack&#x27;s Tracks, a recording studio founded by Jack Clement in 1971 and sold to Allen Reynolds in 1975, where most of Brooks&#x27; albums were recorded. In 2012, in honor of his 50th birthday, Brooks renamed the studio Allentown Studios.

===GhostTunes===

In September 2014, Brooks established GhostTunes, an online music store featuring his own digital music, as well as over ten million songs from other artists. The store, contracted with &quot;the big three&quot; record labels, allows for autonomous pricing and distribution format, resulting in the most proper royalty payments for artists and songwriters. In March 2017, GhostTunes officially closed, merging with Amazon Music.

==Personal life==

Brooks graduated from Oklahoma State University where he starred on the track and field team in the javelin throw. He later completed his MBA from Oklahoma State and participated in the commencement ceremony on May 6, 2011.

Brooks married songwriter Sandy Mahl on May 24, 1986. The couple had three daughters: Taylor Mayne Pearl (b. 1992), August Anna (b. 1994), and Allie Colleen Brooks (b. 1996). Brooks and Mahl separated in March 1999, announcing their plans to divorce on October 9, 2000, and filed for divorce on November 6, 2000. The divorce became final on December 17, 2001.
Brooks remarried on December 10, 2005, to country singer and cookbook author Trisha Yearwood. Yearwood has included various recipes created or inspired by Brooks in her published works, including Garth&#x27;s Breakfast Bowl, a breakfast dish including cheese and garlic tortellini.

In July 2013, Brooks became a grandfather when August had daughter Karalynn with Chance Michael Russell.

===Charitable activities===

In 1999, Brooks began the Teammates for Kids Foundation, which provides financial aid to charities for children. The organization breaks down into three categories spanning three different sports:

*Touch &#x27;Em All Foundation – Baseball Division
*Top Shelf – Hockey Division
*Touchdown – Football Division

Brooks is also a fundraiser for various other charities, including a number of children&#x27;s charities and famine relief. With wife Trisha Yearwood, Brooks sang Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot; on the &quot;Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast&quot; nationwide telethon for Hurricane Katrina relief. He performed the Garth Brooks: Live in LA benefit concerts, five sold-out concerts over a two-day period at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California on January 25 and 26, 2008 (setting numerous records at the high-profile venue in the process and accomplished a feat done by no other artist in music history to perform all 5 shows in a 48-hour time frame). These concerts were staged to raise money for Fire Intervention Relief Effort, serving those impacted by the 2007 California wildfires. Tickets were priced at $40 each and all five shows (totaling more than 85,000 tickets) sold out in 58 minutes. CBS broadcast the first concert live as a telethon for additional fundraising.

Brooks, along with wife Yearwood, has supported Habitat for Humanity&#x27;s work over the years. In December 2010, Brooks played nine shows in less than a week in Nashville at Bridgestone Arena to benefit victims from the May 2010 Nashville flood. Over 140,000 tickets were sold and $5 million raised.

On July 6, 2013, Brooks joined with Toby Keith for a benefit concert for victims of the 2013 Oklahoma tornadoes. The sold-out show featured artists Mel Tillis, John Anderson, Willie Nelson, Trisha Yearwood, Sammy Hagar, Kellie Coffey, Ronnie Dunn, Carrie Underwood and Krystal Keith. It was held at Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium. Most recently, while between legs of his world tour in 2015, Brooks performed a sold-out concert in Barretos, Brazil to benefit the Hospital de Câncer de Barretos.

===Support for gay rights===
In a 1999 interview with &quot;George&quot;, Brooks said, &quot;But if you&#x27;re in love, you&#x27;ve got to follow your heart and trust that God will explain to us why we sometimes fall in love with people of the same sex.&quot; Lyrics to his song, &quot;We Shall Be Free&quot;, features the line, &quot;When we&#x27;re free to love anyone we choose,&quot; which has been interpreted as a reference to same-sex relationships. Brooks won a 1993 GLAAD Media Award for the song.

In 2000, Brooks appeared at the Equality Rocks benefit concert for gay rights. He sang a duet with openly gay singer George Michael.

Brooks&#x27; half-sister, Betsy Smittle, who died in 2013, was a musician who released her own album &quot;Rough Around the Edges&quot; (as Betsy) and was part of Brooks&#x27; band for some years. She also worked with the late country star Gus Hardin and other musicians in Tulsa. Smittle was a lesbian, and Brooks has credited her with some of the inspiration for his support for same-sex marriage.

===Sexual assault allegation===
In October 2024, Brooks was sued by his former hairstylist and makeup artist who claimed she was sexually harassed by him on several occasions. She also claimed that Brooks raped her during a trip the two took to film a Grammy tribute in 2019. Brooks has denied the allegations, calling them a &quot;shakedown&quot; and an extortion attempt. He initially sued his accuser under a pseudonym in an attempt to block the allegations from coming to light. In response to the lawsuit naming him, Brooks named his accuser in a countersuit.

==Awards and records==
Brooks has won a record 22 Academy of Country Music Awards and received a total of 47 overall nominations. His 13 Grammy Award nominations have resulted in 2 awards won, along with Billboard Music Awards, Country Music Association Awards, and many others. Brooks&#x27; work has earned awards and nominations in television and film as well, including the Primetime Emmy Awards and Golden Globe Awards. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2012. In 2010, he was inducted into the Cheyenne Frontier Days Hall of Fame. He has also been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum.

In 2020, Brooks was awarded the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. Age 57 at the time he was named as the Gershwin honoree, he is the youngest recipient of the award. Also in 2020, Cher presented Brooks with the Billboard Icon Award.

In 2021, Brooks was named a recipient for the 43rd Annual Kennedy Center Honors.

===Records===
According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Brooks was the best-selling solo artist of the 20th century in America. This conclusion drew criticism from the press and many music fans who were convinced that Elvis Presley had sold more records, but had been short-changed in the rankings due to faulty RIAA certification methods during his lifetime. Brooks, while proud of his sales accomplishments, stated that he too believed that Presley must have sold more.

The RIAA has since reexamined their methods for counting certifications. Under their revised methods, Presley became the best-selling solo artist in U.S. history, making Brooks the number-two solo artist, ranking third overall, as the Beatles have sold more albums than either he or Presley. The revision brought more criticism of the accuracy of the RIAA&#x27;s figures, this time from Brooks&#x27; followers. On November 5, 2007, Brooks was again named the best selling solo artist in US history, surpassing Presley after audited sales of 123 million were announced. In December 2010, several more of Presley&#x27;s albums received certifications from the RIAA. As a result, Elvis again surpassed Brooks. , the RIAA lists Presley&#x27;s total sales at 134.5 million and Brooks&#x27; at 134 million. Subsequently, &quot;Man Against Machine&quot; has been certified by the RIAA as Platinum and listing Brooks sales as exceeding 136 million, placing Brooks again as the number 1 selling solo artist.

In 2012, Brooks officially passed the Beatles as the top-selling act of the past 20 years, moving 68.5 million units worldwide, almost 5 million more than the Beatles. In May 2014, Brooks&#x27; total album sales reached 69,544,000 copies, which makes him the best-selling album artist in the U.S., ahead of the Beatles (65,730,000), Metallica (54,365,000), Mariah Carey (54,280,000) and Celine Dion (52,234,000).

In September 2016, Brooks became the first and only artist in music history to achieve seven career Diamond Award albums, according to the RIAA (surpassing the previous tied record of six next to The Beatles).

On June 16, 2021, Brooks won the &quot;Pollstar&quot; award as the &quot;country touring artist of the decade&quot; (2010s). Brooks thanked his band for the companionship during all those years.

<text>Alexandre Gustave Eiffel ( , ; Bonickhausen dit Eiffel; 15 December 1832 – 27 December 1923) was a French civil engineer. A graduate of École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures, he made his name with various bridges for the French railway network, most famously the Garabit Viaduct. He is best known for the world-famous Eiffel Tower, designed by his company and built for the 1889 Universal Exposition in Paris, and his contribution to building the Statue of Liberty in New York. After his retirement from engineering, Eiffel focused on research into meteorology and aerodynamics, making significant contributions in both fields.

== Early life ==
Alexandre Gustave Eiffel was born in France, in the Côte-d&#x27;Or, the first child of Catherine-Mélanie (née Moneuse) and Alexandre Bonickhausen dit Eiffel. He was a descendant of Marguerite Frédérique (née Lideriz) and Jean-René Bönickhausen, who had emigrated from the German town of Marmagen and settled in Paris at the beginning of the 19th century. The family adopted the name Eiffel as a reference to the Eifel mountains in the region from which they had come. Although the family always used the name Eiffel, Gustave&#x27;s name was registered at birth as Bonickhausen dit Eiffel, and was not formally changed to Eiffel until 1880.

At the time of Gustave&#x27;s birth, his father, an ex-soldier, was working as an administrator for the French Army; but shortly after his birth his mother expanded a charcoal business she had inherited from her parents to include a coal-distribution business, and soon afterwards his father gave up his job to assist her. Due to his mother&#x27;s business commitments, Gustave spent his childhood living with his grandmother, but nevertheless remained close to his mother, who was to remain an influential figure until her death in 1878. The business was successful enough for Catherine Eiffel to sell it in 1843 and retire on the proceeds. Eiffel was not a studious child, and thought his classes at the Lycée Royal in Dijon boring and a waste of time, although in his last two years, influenced by his teachers for history and literature, he began to study seriously, and he gained his baccalauréats in humanities and science.
An important part in his education was played by his uncle, Jean-Baptiste Mollerat, who had invented a process for distilling vinegar and had a large chemical works near Dijon, and one of his uncle&#x27;s friends, the chemist Michel Perret. Both men spent a lot of time with the young Eiffel, teaching him about everything from chemistry and mining to theology and philosophy.

Eiffel went on to attend the Collège Sainte-Barbe in Paris, to prepare for the difficult entrance exams set by engineering colleges in France, and qualified for entry to two of the most prestigious schools – École polytechnique and École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures – and ultimately entered the latter. During his second year he chose to specialize in chemistry, and graduated ranking at 13th place out of 80 candidates in 1855. This was the year that Paris hosted a World&#x27;s Fair, and Eiffel was bought a season ticket by his mother.

== Early career ==

After graduation, Eiffel had hoped to find work in his uncle&#x27;s workshop in Dijon, but a family dispute made this impossible. After a few months working as an unpaid assistant to his brother-in-law, who managed a foundry, Eiffel approached the railway engineer Charles Nepveu, who gave Eiffel his first paid job as his private secretary. However, shortly afterwards Nepveu&#x27;s company went bankrupt, Nepveu found Eiffel a job designing a sheet iron bridge for the Saint Germaine railway. Some of Nepveu&#x27;s businesses were then acquired by the Compagnie Belge de Matériels de Chemin de Fer: Nepveu was appointed the managing director of the two factories in Paris, and offered Eiffel a job as head of the research department. In 1857 Nepveu negotiated a contract to build a railway bridge over the river Garonne at Bordeaux, connecting the Paris-Bordeaux line to the lines running to Sète and Bayonne, which involved the construction of a iron girder bridge supported by six pairs of masonry piers on the river bed. These were constructed with the aid of compressed air caissons and hydraulic rams, both innovative techniques at the time. Eiffel was initially given the responsibility of assembling the metalwork and eventually took over the management of the entire project from Nepveu, who resigned in March 1860.

Following the completion of the project on schedule Eiffel was appointed as the principal engineer of the Compagnie Belge. His work had also gained the attention of several people who were later to give him work, including Stanislas de la Roche Toulay, who had prepared the design for the metalwork of the Bordeaux bridge, Jean Baptiste Krantz and Wilhelm Nordling. Further promotion within the company followed, but the business began to decline, and in 1865 Eiffel, seeing no future there, resigned and set up as an independent consulting engineer. He was already working independently on the construction of two railway stations, at Toulouse and Agen, and in 1866 he was given a contract to oversee the construction of 33 locomotives for the Egyptian government, a profitable but undemanding job in the course of which he visited Egypt, where he visited the Suez Canal which was being constructed by Ferdinand de Lesseps. At the same time he was employed by Jean-Baptiste Kranz to assist him in the design of the exhibition hall for the Exposition Universelle which was to be held in 1867. Eiffel&#x27;s principal job was to draw up the arch girders of the Galerie des Machines. In order to carry out this work, Eiffel and Henri Treca, the director of the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, conducted valuable research on the structural properties of cast iron, definitively establishing the modulus of elasticity applicable to compound castings.

== Eiffel et Cie ==

At the end of 1866 Eiffel managed to borrow enough cash to set up his own workshops at 48 Rue Fouquet in Levallois-Perret. His first important commission was for two viaducts for the railway line between Lyon and Bordeaux, and the company also began to undertake work in other countries, including St. Mark&#x27;s Cathedral in Arica, Peru, which was an all-metal prefabricated building, manufactured in France and shipped to South America in pieces to be assembled on site; first it was intended for the city of Ancón, a beach near Lima, but the Peruvian Government of President José Balta changed the final destination to Arica because the old church was destroyed by an earthquake on 13 August 1868. Because of this, a committee of ladies of Arica asked Balta to relocate Eiffel&#x27;s structure to Arica.

On 6 October 1868 he entered into partnership with Théophile Seyrig, a fellow graduate of the École Centrale, forming the company Eiffel et Cie.
In 1875, Eiffel et Cie were given two important contracts, one for the Budapest Nyugati railway station for the Vienna to Budapest railway and the other for a bridge over the river Douro in Portugal. The station in Budapest was an innovative design. The usual pattern for building a railway terminus was to conceal the metal structure behind an elaborate facade: Eiffel&#x27;s design for Budapest used the metal structure as the centerpiece of the building, flanked on either side by conventional stone and brick-clad structures housing administrative offices.

The bridge over the Douro came about as the result of a competition held by the Royal Portuguese Railroad Company. The task was a demanding one: the river was fast-flowing, up to deep, and had a bed formed of a deep layer of gravel which made the construction of piers on the river bed impossible, and so the bridge had to have a central span of . This was greater than the longest arch span which had been built at the time.
Eiffel&#x27;s proposal was for a bridge whose deck was supported by five iron piers, with the abutments of the pair on the river bank also bearing a central supporting arch. The price quoted by Eiffel was FF.965,000, far below the nearest competitor and so he was given the job, although since his company was less experienced than his rivals the Portuguese authorities appointed a committee to report on Eiffel et Cie&#x27;s suitability. The members included Jean-Baptiste Krantz, Henri Dion and Léon Molinos, both of whom had known Eiffel for a long time: their report was favorable, and Eiffel got the job. On-site work began in January 1876 and was complete by the end of October 1877: the bridge was ceremonially opened by King Luís I and Queen Maria Pia, after whom the bridge was named, on 4 November.

The Exposition Universelle in 1878 firmly established his reputation as one of the leading engineers of the time. As well as exhibiting models and drawings of work undertaken by the company, Eiffel was also responsible for the construction of several of the exhibition buildings. One of these, a pavilion for the Paris Gas Company, was Eiffel&#x27;s first collaboration with Stephen Sauvestre, who was later to become the head of the company&#x27;s architectural office.

In 1879 the partnership with Seyrig was dissolved, and the company was renamed the Compagnie des Établissements Eiffel.
The same year the company was given the contract for the Garabit viaduct, a railway bridge near Ruynes en Margeride in the Cantal département. Like the Douro bridge, the project involved a lengthy viaduct crossing the river valley as well as the river itself, and Eiffel was given the job without any process of competitive tendering due to his success with the bridge over the Douro. To assist him in the work he took on several people who were to play important roles in the design and construction of the Eiffel Tower, including Maurice Koechlin, a young graduate of the Zurich Polytechnikum, who was engaged to undertake calculations and make drawings, and Émile Nouguier, who had previously worked for Eiffel on the construction of the Douro bridge.
The same year Eiffel started work on a system of standardised prefabricated bridges, an idea that was the result of a conversation with the governor of Cochin-China. These used a small number of standard components, all small enough to be readily transportable in areas with poor or non-existent roads, and were joined using bolts rather than rivets, reducing the need for skilled labour on site. A number of different types were produced, ranging from footbridges to standard-gauge railway bridges.

In 1881 Eiffel was contacted by Auguste Bartholdi who was in need of an engineer to help him to realise the Statue of Liberty. Some work had already been carried out by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, but he had died in 1879. Eiffel was selected because of his experience with wind stresses. Eiffel devised a structure consisting of a four legged pylon to support the copper sheeting which made up the body of the statue. The entire statue was erected at the Eiffel works in Paris before being dismantled and shipped to the United States.

In 1886 Eiffel also designed the dome for the Astronomical Observatory in Nice. This was the most important building in a complex designed by Charles Garnier, later among the most prominent critics of the Tower. The dome, with a diameter of , was the largest in the world when built and used an ingenious bearing device: rather than running on wheels or rollers, it was supported by a ring-shaped hollow girder floating in a circular trough containing a solution of magnesium chloride in water. This had been patented by Eiffel in 1881.

=== The Eiffel Tower ===
The design of the Eiffel Tower was originated by Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier, who had discussed ideas for a centrepiece for the 1889 Exposition Universelle. In May 1884 Koechlin, working at his home, made an outline drawing of their scheme, described by him as &quot;a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals&quot;. Initially Eiffel showed little enthusiasm, although he did sanction further study of the project, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre to add architectural embellishments. Sauvestre added the decorative arches to the base, a glass pavilion to the first level and the cupola at the top. The enhanced idea gained Eiffel&#x27;s support for the project, and he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier and Sauvestre had taken out. The design was exhibited at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884, and on 30 March 1885 Eiffel read a paper on the project to the Société des Ingénieurs Civils. After discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying that the tower would symbolise
Little happened until the beginning of 1886, but with the re-election of Jules Grévy as president and his appointment of Edouard Lockroy as Minister for Trade decisions began to be made. A budget for the Exposition was passed and on 1 May Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition which was being held for a centerpiece for the exposition, which effectively made the choice of Eiffel&#x27;s design a foregone conclusion: all entries had to include a study for a four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars. On 12 May a commission was set up to examine Eiffel&#x27;s scheme and its rivals and on 12 June it presented its decision, which was that only Eiffel&#x27;s proposal met their requirements. After some debate about the exact site for the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. This was signed by Eiffel acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, and granted him one and a half million francs toward the construction costs. This was less than a quarter of the estimated cost of six and a half million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation during the exhibition and for the following twenty years. Eiffel later established a separate company to manage the tower.

The tower had been a subject of some controversy, attracting criticism both from those who did not believe it feasible and from those who objected on artistic grounds. Just as work began at the Champ de Mars, the &quot;Committee of Three Hundred&quot; (one member for each metre of the tower&#x27;s height) was formed, led by Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the French arts establishment, including Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet: a petition was sent to Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, the Minister of Works, and was published by &quot;Le Temps&quot;. 

Work on the foundations started on 28 January 1887. Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, each leg resting on four concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg but the other two, being closer to the river Seine were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons long and in diameter driven to a depth of to support the concrete slabs, which were thick. Each of these slabs supported a limestone block, each with an inclined top to bear the supporting shoe for the ironwork. These shoes were anchored by bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and long.
Work on the foundations was complete by 30 June and the erection of the iron work was started. Although no more than 250 men were employed on the site, a prodigious amount of exacting preparatory work was entailed: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detail drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed. The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the positions of rivet holes were specified to within 0.1 mm (0.004 in) and angles worked out to one second of arc. The components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, were first bolted together, the bolts being replaced by rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit it was sent back to the factory for alteration. The four legs, each at an angle of 54° to the ground, were initially constructed as cantilevers, relying on the anchoring bolts in the masonry foundation blocks. Eiffel had calculated that this would be satisfactory until they approached halfway to the first level: accordingly work was stopped for the purpose of erecting a wooden supporting scaffold. This gave ammunition to his critics, and lurid headlines including &quot;Eiffel Suicide!&quot; and &quot;Gustave Eiffel has gone mad: he has been confined in an Asylum&quot; appeared in the popular press. At this stage a small &quot;creeper&quot; crane was installed in each leg, designed to move up the tower as construction progressed and making use of the guides for the elevators which were to be fitted in each leg. After this brief pause erection of the metalwork continued, and the critical operation of linking the four legs was successfully completed by March 1888. In order to precisely align the legs so that the connecting girders could be put into place, a provision had been made to enable precise adjustments by placing hydraulic jacks in the footings for each of the girders making up the legs.

The main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and, on 31 March, Eiffel celebrated by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower. Since the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, Eiffel frequently stopping to make explanations of various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including Nouguier, Compagnon, the President of the City Council and reporters from &quot;Le Figaro&quot; and &quot;Le Monde Illustré&quot; completed the climb. At 2.35 Eiffel hoisted a large tricolour, to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired from the lower level.

=== The Panama Scandal ===

In 1887, Eiffel became involved with the French effort to construct a canal across the Panama Isthmus. The French Panama Canal Company, headed by Ferdinand de Lesseps, had been attempting to build a sea-level canal, but came to the realization that this was impractical. The plan was changed to one using locks, which Eiffel was contracted to design and build. The locks were on a large scale, most having a change of level of . Eiffel had been working on the project for little more than a year when the company suspended payments of interest on 14 December 1888, and shortly afterwards was put into liquidation. Eiffel&#x27;s reputation was badly damaged when he was implicated in the financial and political scandal which followed. Although he was simply a contractor, he was charged along with the directors of the project with raising money under false pretenses and misappropriation of funds. On 9 February 1893, Eiffel was found guilty on the charge of misuse of funds and was fined 20,000 francs and sentenced to two years in prison, although he was acquitted on appeal. The later American-built canal used new lock designs (see History of the Panama Canal).

Shortly before the trial, Eiffel had announced his intention to resign from the Board of Directors of the Compagnie des Etablissements Eiffel and did so at a General Meeting held on 14 February, saying, &quot;I have absolutely decided to abstain from any participation in any manufacturing business from now on, and so that no one can be misled and to make it most evident I intend to remain uninvolved with the establishments that bears my name, and insist that it be removed from the company&#x27;s name.&quot; The company changed its name to La Société Constructions Levallois-Perret, with Maurice Koechlin as managing director. The name was changed to the Anciens Etablissements Eiffel in 1937.

== Later career ==

After his retirement from the Compagnie des Etablissements Eiffel, Eiffel went on to do important work in meteorology and aerodynamics. Eiffel&#x27;s interest in these areas was a consequence of the problems he had encountered with the effects of wind forces on the structures he had built.

His first aerodynamic experiments, investigating the air resistance of surfaces, were carried out by dropping the surface to be investigated together with a measuring apparatus down a vertical cable stretched between the second level of the Eiffel Tower and the ground. Using this Eiffel definitely established that the air resistance of a body was very closely related to the square of the airspeed. He then built a laboratory on the Champ de Mars at the foot of the tower in 1905, building his first wind tunnel there in 1909. The wind tunnel was used to investigate the characteristics of the airfoil sections used by the early pioneers of aviation such as the Wright Brothers, Gabriel Voisin and Louis Blériot. Eiffel established that the lift produced by an airfoil was the result of a reduction of air pressure above the wing rather than an increase of pressure acting on the under surface. Following complaints about noise from people living nearby, he moved his experiments to a new establishment at Auteuil in 1912. Here it was possible to build a larger wind tunnel, and Eiffel began to make tests using scale models of aircraft designs.
In 1913 Eiffel was awarded the Samuel P. Langley Medal for Aerodromics by the Smithsonian Institution. In his speech at the presentation of the medal, Alexander Graham Bell said:
Eiffel had meteorological measuring equipment placed on the tower in 1889, and also built a weather station at his house in Sèvres. Between 1891 and 1892 he compiled a complete set of meteorological readings, and later extended his record-taking to include measurements from 25 different locations across France.
Eiffel died on 27 December 1923, while listening to Beethoven&#x27;s 5th symphony &quot;andante&quot;, in his mansion on Rue Rabelais in Paris. He was buried in the family tomb in Levallois-Perret Cemetery.

==Influence==

Gustave Eiffel&#x27;s career was a result of the Industrial Revolution. For a variety of economic and political reasons, this had been slow to make an impact in France, and Eiffel had the good fortune to be working at a time of rapid industrial development in France. Eiffel&#x27;s importance as an engineer was twofold. Firstly he was ready to adopt innovative techniques first used by others, such as his use of compressed-air caissons and hollow cast-iron piers, and secondly he was a pioneer in his insistence on basing all engineering decisions on thorough calculation of the forces involved, combining this analytical approach with an insistence on a high standard of accuracy in drawing and manufacture.

The growth of the railway network had an immense effect on people&#x27;s lives, but although the enormous number of bridges and other work undertaken by Eiffel were an important part of this, the two works that did most to make him famous are the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower, both projects of immense symbolic importance and today internationally recognized landmarks. The Tower is also important because of its role in establishing the aesthetic potential of structures whose appearance is largely dictated by practical considerations.

His contribution to the science of aerodynamics is probably of equal importance to his work as an engineer.

== Heritage protection efforts ==
A number of works of Gustave Eiffel are in danger today. Some have already been destroyed, like in Vietnam.
A proposal to demolish the railway bridge of Bordeaux (also known as the &quot;passerelle St Jean&quot;), the first major work of Gustave Eiffel, resulted in a large response from the public. Actions to protect the bridge were taken as early as 2002 by the &quot;Association of the Descendants of Gustave Eiffel&quot;, joined from 2005 onwards by the Association &quot;Sauvons la Passerelle Eiffel&quot; (&quot;Save the Eiffel Bridge&quot;). They led, in 2010, to the decision to list Eiffel&#x27;s Bordeaux bridge as a French Historical Monument.

<text>Greenpeace is an independent global campaigning network, founded in Canada in 1971 by a group of environmental activists. Greenpeace states its goal is to &quot;ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity&quot; and focuses its campaigning on worldwide issues such as climate change, deforestation, overfishing, commercial whaling, genetic engineering, anti-war and anti-nuclear issues. It uses direct action, advocacy, research, and ecotage to achieve its goals.

The network comprises 26 independent national/regional organisations in over 55 countries across Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia and the Pacific, as well as a coordinating body, Greenpeace International, based in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

The global network does not accept funding from governments, corporations, or political parties, relying on three million individual supporters and foundation grants. Greenpeace has a general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council and is a founding member of the INGO Accountability Charter, an international non-governmental organization that intends to foster accountability and transparency of non-governmental organizations.

Greenpeace is known for its nonviolent direct actions and has been described as one of the most visible environmental organizations in the world. It has raised environmental issues to public knowledge, and influenced both the private and the public sector. The organization has received criticism; it was the subject of an open letter from more than 100 Nobel laureates urging Greenpeace to end its campaign against genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The organization&#x27;s direct actions have sparked legal actions against Greenpeace activists, such as fines and suspended sentences for destroying a test plot of genetically modified wheat and, according to the Peruvian Government, damaging the Nazca Lines, a UN World Heritage site.

==History==

===Origins===
In the late 1960s, the U.S. had planned its &quot;Cannikin&quot; underground nuclear weapon test in the tectonically unstable island of Amchitka in Alaska; the plans raised some concerns of the test triggering earthquakes and causing a tsunami. Some 7,000 people blocked the Peace Arch Border Crossing between British Columbia and Washington, carrying signs reading &quot;Don&#x27;t Make A Wave. It&#x27;s Your Fault If Our Fault Goes&quot;. and &quot;Stop My Ark&#x27;s Not Finished&quot;. The protests did not stop the U.S. from detonating the bomb.

While no earthquake or tsunami followed the test, the opposition grew when the U.S. announced they would detonate a bomb five times more powerful than the first one. Among the opponents were Jim Bohlen, a veteran who had served in the U.S. Navy, and Irving Stowe and Dorothy Stowe, who had recently become Quakers. They were frustrated by the lack of action by the Sierra Club Canada, of which they were members. From Irving Stowe, Jim Bohlen learned of a form of passive resistance, &quot;bearing witness&quot;, where objectionable activity is protested simply by mere presence. Jim Bohlen&#x27;s wife Marie came up with the idea to sail to Amchitka, inspired by the anti-nuclear voyages of Albert Bigelow in 1958. The idea ended up in the press and was linked to The Sierra Club. The Sierra Club did not like this connection and in 1970 the Don&#x27;t Make a Wave Committee was established for the protest. Early meetings were held in the Shaughnessy home of Robert Hunter and his wife Bobbi Hunter. Subsequently, the Stowe home at 2775 Courtenay Street in Vancouver became the headquarters. As Rex Weyler put it in his chronology, &quot;Greenpeace&quot;, in 1969, Irving and Dorothy Stowe&#x27;s &quot;quiet home on Courtenay Street would soon become a hub of monumental, global significance&quot;. Some of the first Greenpeace meetings were held there. The first office was opened in a backroom, storefront on Cypress and West Broadway southeast corner in Kitsilano, Vancouver. Within half a year Greenpeace moved in to share the upstairs office space with The Society Promoting Environmental Conservation on the second floor at 2007, 4th Ave. and Maple in Kitsilano.

Irving Stowe arranged a benefit concert (supported by Joan Baez) that took place on 16 October 1970 at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver. The concert created the financial basis for the first Greenpeace campaign. Amchitka, the 1970 concert that launched Greenpeace was published by Greenpeace in November 2009 on CD and is also available as an mp3 download via the Amchitka concert website. Using the money raised with the concert, the Don&#x27;t Make a Wave Committee chartered a ship, the &quot;Phyllis Cormack&quot; owned and sailed by John Cormack. The ship was renamed &quot;Greenpeace&quot; for the protest after a term coined by activist Bill Darnell. The complete crew included: Captain John Cormack (the boat&#x27;s owner), Jim Bohlen, Bill Darnell, Patrick Moore, Dr Lyle Thurston, Dave Birmingham, Terry A. Simmons, Richard Fineberg, Robert Hunter (journalist), Ben Metcalfe (journalist), Bob Cummings (journalist) and Bob Keziere (photographer).

On 15 September 1971, the ship sailed towards Amchitka and faced the U.S. Coast Guard ship &quot;Confidence&quot; which forced the activists to turn back. Because of this and the increasingly bad weather the crew decided to return to Canada only to find out that the news about their journey and reported support from the crew of the &quot;Confidence&quot; had generated sympathy for their protest. After this Greenpeace tried to navigate to the test site with other vessels, until the U.S. detonated the bomb. The nuclear test was criticized, and the U.S. decided not to continue with their test plans at Amchitka.

====Founders and founding time of Greenpeace====

Environmental historian Frank Zelko dates the formation of the &quot;Don&#x27;t Make a Wave Committee&quot; to 1969 and, according to Jim Bohlen, the group adopted the name &quot;Don&#x27;t Make a Wave Committee&quot; on 28 November 1969. According to the Greenpeace web site, The Don&#x27;t Make a Wave Committee was established in 1970. The certificate of incorporation of The Don&#x27;t Make a Wave Committee dates the incorporation to the fifth of October, 1970. Researcher Vanessa Timmer dates the official incorporation to 1971. Greenpeace itself calls the protest voyage of 1971 as &quot;the beginning&quot;. According to Patrick Moore, who was an early member and has since mutually distanced himself from Greenpeace, and Rex Weyler, the name of &quot;The Don&#x27;t Make a Wave Committee&quot; was officially changed to Greenpeace Foundation in 1972.

Vanessa Timmer has referred to the early members as &quot;an unlikely group of loosely organized protestors&quot;. Frank Zelko has commented that &quot;unlike Friends of the Earth, for example, which sprung fully formed from the forehead of David Brower, Greenpeace developed in a more evolutionary manner. There was no single founder&quot;. Greenpeace itself says on its web page that &quot;there&#x27;s a joke that in any bar in Vancouver, British Columbia, you can sit down next to someone who claims to have founded Greenpeace. In fact, there was no single founder: name, idea, spirit and tactics can all be said to have separate lineages&quot;. Patrick Moore has said that &quot;the truth is that Greenpeace was always a work in progress, not something definitively founded like a country or a company. Therefore there are a few shades of gray about who might lay claim to being a founder of Greenpeace.&quot; Early Greenpeace director Rex Weyler says on his homepage that the insiders of Greenpeace have debated about the founders since the mid-1970s.

The current Greenpeace web site lists the founders of The Don&#x27;t Make a Wave Committee as Dorothy and Irving Stowe, Marie and Jim Bohlen, Ben and Dorothy Metcalfe, and Robert Hunter. According to both Patrick Moore and an interview with Dorothy Stowe, Dorothy Metcalfe, Jim Bohlen and Robert Hunter, the founders of The Don&#x27;t Make a Wave Committee were Paul Cote, Irving and Dorothy Stowe and Jim and Marie Bohlen.

Paul Watson, founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society maintains that he also was one of the founders of The Don&#x27;t Make a Wave Committee and Greenpeace. Greenpeace has stated that Watson was an influential early member, but not one of the founders of Greenpeace. Watson has since accused Greenpeace of rewriting their history.

Because Patrick Moore was among the crew of the first protest voyage, Moore also considers himself one of the founders. Greenpeace claims that although Moore was a significant early member, he was not among the founders of Greenpeace.

===After Amchitka===
After the office in the Stowe home, (and after the first concert fund-raiser) Greenpeace functions moved to other private homes and held public meetings weekly on Wednesday nights at the Kitsilano Neighborhood House before settling, in the autumn of 1974, in a small office shared with the SPEC environmental group at 2007 West 4th at Maple in Kitsilano. When the nuclear tests at Amchitka were over, Greenpeace moved its focus to the French atmospheric nuclear weapons testing at the Moruroa Atoll in French Polynesia. The young organization needed help for their protests and were contacted by David McTaggart, a former businessman living in New Zealand. In 1972 the yacht &quot;Vega&quot;, a ketch owned by David McTaggart, was renamed &quot;Greenpeace III&quot; and sailed in an anti-nuclear protest into the exclusion zone at Moruroa to attempt to disrupt French nuclear testing. This voyage was sponsored and organized by the New Zealand branch of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. The French Navy tried to stop the protest in several ways, including assaulting David McTaggart. McTaggart was supposedly beaten to the point that he lost sight in one of his eyes. However, one of McTaggart&#x27;s crew members photographed the incident and went public. After the assault was publicized, France announced it would stop the atmospheric nuclear tests.

In the mid-1970s some Greenpeace members started an independent campaign, Project Ahab, against commercial whaling, since Irving Stowe was against Greenpeace focusing on other issues than nuclear weapons. After Irving Stowe died in 1975, the &quot;Phyllis Cormack&quot; sailed from Vancouver to face Soviet whalers on the coast of California. Greenpeace activists disrupted the whaling by placing themselves between the harpoons and the whales, and footage of the protests spread across the world. Later in the 1970s, the organization widened its focus to include toxic waste and commercial seal hunting.

The &quot;Greenpeace Declaration of Interdependence&quot; was published by Greenpeace in the &quot;Greenpeace Chronicles&quot; (Winter 1976–77). This declaration was a condensation of a number of ecological manifestos Bob Hunter had written over the years.

===Organizational development===

Greenpeace evolved from a group of Canadian and American protesters into a less conservative group of environmentalists who were more reflective of the counterculture and hippie youth movements of the 1960s and 1970s. The social and cultural background from which Greenpeace emerged heralded a period of de-conditioning away from Old World antecedents and sought to develop new codes of social, environmental and political behavior.

In the mid-1970s independent groups using the name Greenpeace started springing up worldwide. By 1977, there were 15 to 20 Greenpeace groups around the world, including Great Lakes Greenpeace at Michigan State University. At the same time the Canadian Greenpeace office was heavily in debt. Disputes between offices over fund-raising and organizational direction split the global movement as the North American offices were reluctant to be under the authority of the Canada office.

After the incidents of Moruroa Atoll, David McTaggart had moved to France to battle in court with the French state and helped to develop the cooperation of European Greenpeace groups. David McTaggart lobbied the Canadian Greenpeace Foundation to accept a new structure bringing the scattered Greenpeace offices under the auspices of a single global organization. The European Greenpeace paid the debt of the Canadian Greenpeace office and on 14 October 1979, Greenpeace International came into existence. Under the new structure, the local offices contributed a percentage of their income to the international organization, which took responsibility for setting the overall direction of the movement with each regional office having one vote. Some Greenpeace groups, namely London Greenpeace (dissolved in 2001) and the US-based Greenpeace Foundation (still operational) however decided to remain independent from Greenpeace International.

Along with several other NGOs, Greenpeace was the subject of an improper and baseless investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation between 2001 and 2005. The Inspector General of the US Justice Department determined that there was little or no basis for the investigation and that it resulted in the FBI making inaccurate and misleading claims to the United States Congress.

In 2015, Greenpeace UK launched an investigative journalism publication called &quot;Unearthed&quot;.

==Organizational structure==

===Governance===

Greenpeace consists of &quot;Greenpeace International&quot; (officially Stichting Greenpeace Council) based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and 25 regional offices operating in 55 countries. The regional offices work largely autonomously under the supervision of Greenpeace International. The executive director of Greenpeace is elected by the board members of Greenpeace International. The current international executive director of Greenpeace International is Mads Flarup Christensen and the current Chair of the Board is David Tong. Greenpeace has a staff of 2,400 and 15,000 volunteers globally.

Each regional office is led by a regional executive director elected by the regional board of directors. The regional boards also appoint a trustee to The Greenpeace International Annual General Meeting, where the trustees elect or remove the board of directors of Greenpeace International. The annual general meeting&#x27;s role is also to discuss and decide the overall principles and strategically important issues for Greenpeace in collaboration with the trustees of regional offices and Greenpeace International board of directors.

===Funding===
Greenpeace receives its funding from individual supporters and foundations. It screens all major donations in order to ensure it does not receive unwanted donations. Other than the Netherlands&#x27; National Postcode Lottery, the biggest government-sponsored lottery in that country, the organization does not accept money from governments, intergovernmental organizations, political parties or corporations in order to avoid their influence.

Donations from foundations which are funded by political parties or receive most of their funding from governments or intergovernmental organizations are rejected. Foundation donations are also rejected if the foundations attach unreasonable conditions, restrictions or constraints on Greenpeace activities or if the donation would compromise the independence and aims of the organization. Since in the mid-1990s the number of supporters started to decrease, Greenpeace pioneered the use of face-to-face fundraising where fundraisers actively seek new supporters at public places, subscribing them for a monthly direct debit donation. In 2008, most of the €202.5 million received by the organization was donated by about 2.6 million regular supporters, mainly from Europe. In 2014, the organization&#x27;s annual revenue was reported to be about €300 million (US$400 million) although they lost about €4 million (US$5 million) in currency speculation that year.

In September 2003, Public Interest Watch (PIW) complained to the Internal Revenue Service that Greenpeace US&#x27;s A tax returns were inaccurate and in violation of the law. The IRS conducted an extensive review and concluded in December 2005 that Greenpeace USA continued to qualify for its tax-exempt status. In March 2006 &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that PIW&#x27;s &quot;federal tax filing, covering August 2003 to July 2004, stated that $120,000 of the $124,095 the group received in contributions during that period came from ExxonMobil&quot;. In 2013, after the IRS performed a follow-up audit, which again was clean, and, following claims of politically motivated IRS audits of groups affiliated with the Tea Party movement, Greenpeace U.S. Executive Director Phil Radford called for a Congressional investigation into all politically motivated audits – including those allegedly targeting the Tea Party Movement, the NAACP, and Greenpeace.

=== Digital transformation ===
International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo declared the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Conference a &quot;colossal failure&quot; and indicated the organization faced a &quot;burning platform&quot; moment. Naidoo encouraged Greenpeace&#x27;s international executive directors to embrace new strategies and tactics or risk becoming irrelevant.

To implement a new strategy approved in 2010, Greenpeace hired Michael Silberman to build a &quot;Digital Mobilisation Centre of Excellence&quot; in 2011, which turned into the Mobilisation Lab (&quot;MobLab&quot;). Designed as a source of best practices, testing, and strategy development, the MobLab also focused on increasing digital capacity and promoting community-based campaigning in 42 countries. In March 2017, the MobLab spun out of Greenpeace through a joint investment by Greenpeace and CIVICUS World Alliance for Citizen Participation.&quot;

==Summary of priorities and campaigns==
On its International website, Greenpeace defines its mission as the following:

Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation, which uses non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems, and develop solutions for a green and peaceful future. Our goal is to ensure the ability of the earth to nurture life in all its diversity. That means we want to:

* Stop the planet from warming beyond 1.5° to prevent the most catastrophic impacts of the climate breakdown.
* Protect biodiversity in all its forms.
* Slow the volume of hyper-consumption and learn to live within our means.
* Promote renewable energy as a solution that can power the world.
* Nurture peace, global disarmament and non-violence.
==Climate and energy==

Greenpeace was one of the first parties to formulate a sustainable development scenario for climate change mitigation, which it did in 1993. According to sociologists Marc Mormont and Christine Dasnoy, the organization played a significant role in raising public awareness of global warming in the 1990s. Greenpeace has also focused on CFCs, because of both their global warming potential and their effect on the ozone layer. It was one of the leading participants advocating early phase-out of ozone depleting substances in the Montreal Protocol. In the early 1990s, Greenpeace developed a CFC-free refrigerator technology, &quot;Greenfreeze&quot; for mass production together with the refrigerator industry. United Nations Environment Programme awarded Greenpeace for &quot;outstanding contributions to the protection of the Earth&#x27;s ozone layer&quot; in 1997. In 2011 two-fifths of the world&#x27;s total production of refrigerators were based on Greenfreeze technology, with over 600 million units in use.

Currently Greenpeace considers global warming to be the greatest environmental problem facing the Earth. It calls for global greenhouse gas emissions to peak in 2015 and to decrease as close to zero as possible by 2050. To reach these numbers, Greenpeace has called for the industrialized countries to cut their emissions at least 40% by 2020 (from 1990 levels) and to give substantial funding for developing countries to build a sustainable energy capacity, to adapt to the inevitable consequences of global warming, and to stop deforestation by 2020. Together with EREC, Greenpeace has formulated a global energy scenario, &quot;Energy [R]evolution&quot;, where 80% of the world&#x27;s total energy is produced with renewables, and the emissions of the energy sector are decreased by over 80% of the 1990 levels by 2050.

Using direct action, members Greenpeace have protested several times against coal by occupying coal power plants and blocking coal shipments and mining operations, in places such as New Zealand, Svalbard, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Greenpeace is also critical of extracting petroleum from oil sands and has used direct action to block operations at the Athabasca oil sands in Canada.

=== Green Planet Energy ===
In 1999 Greenpeace Germany (NGO) founded Greenpeace Energy, a renewable electricity cooperative that supplied customers with fossil gas starting from 2011. After a 2021 media outcry about an entity associated with Greenpeace selling fossil fuel which has been described as greenwashing, the cooperative changed its name to Green Planet Energy. The Greenpeace Germany NGO retains one share in the cooperative, which has been criticized for &quot;greenwashing&quot; Russian gas.

===Kingsnorth court case===
In October 2007, six Greenpeace protesters were arrested for breaking into the Kingsnorth power station in Kent, England; climbing the smokestack, painting the name Gordon on the chimney (in reference to former UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown), and causing an estimated £30,000 damage. At their subsequent trial they admitted trying to shut the station down, but argued that they were legally justified because they were trying to prevent climate change from causing greater damage to property elsewhere around the world. Evidence was heard from David Cameron&#x27;s environment adviser Zac Goldsmith, climate scientist James E. Hansen and an Inuit leader from Greenland, all saying that climate change was already seriously affecting life around the world. The six activists were acquitted. It was the first case where preventing property damage caused by climate change has been used as part of a &quot;lawful excuse&quot; defense in court. Both &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the acquittal as an embarrassment to the Brown Ministry. In December 2008 &quot;The New York Times&quot; listed the acquittal in its annual list of the most influential ideas of the year.

===&quot;Go Beyond Oil&quot;===

As part of their stance on renewable energy commercialisation, Greenpeace have launched the &quot;Go Beyond Oil&quot; campaign. The campaign is focused on slowing, and eventually ending, the world&#x27;s consumption of oil; with activist activities taking place against companies that pursue oil drilling as a venture. Much of the activities of the &quot;Go Beyond Oil&quot; campaign have been focused on drilling for oil in the Arctic and areas affected by the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; disaster. The activities of Greenpeace in the Arctic have mainly involved the Edinburgh-based oil and gas exploration company, Cairn Energy; and range from protests at the Cairn Energy&#x27;s headquarters to scaling their oil rigs in an attempt to halt the drilling process.

The &quot;Go Beyond Oil&quot; campaign also involves applying political pressure on the governments who allow oil exploration in their territories; with the group stating that one of the key aims of the &quot;Go Beyond Oil&quot; campaign is to &quot;work to expose the lengths the oil industry is willing to go to squeeze the last barrels out of the ground and put pressure on industry and governments to move beyond oil.&quot;

===Nuclear power===

Greenpeace is opposed to nuclear power because it views it as &quot;dangerous, polluting, expensive and non-renewable&quot;. The organization highlights the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986 and Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011 as evidence of the risk nuclear power can pose to people&#x27;s lives, the environment and the economy. Greenpeace views the benefits of nuclear power to be relatively minor in comparison to its major problems and risks, such as environmental damage and risks from uranium mining, nuclear weapons proliferation, and unresolved questions concerning nuclear waste.

The organization argues that the potential of nuclear power to mitigate global warming is marginal, referring to the IEA energy scenario where an increase in world&#x27;s nuclear capacity from 2608 TWh in 2007 to 9857 TWh by 2050 would cut global greenhouse gas emissions less than 5% and require 32 nuclear reactor units of 1000 MW capacity built per year until 2050. According to Greenpeace, the slow construction times, construction delays, and hidden costs all negate nuclear power&#x27;s mitigation potential. This makes the IEA scenario technically and financially unrealistic. They also argue that binding massive amounts of investments on nuclear energy would take funding away from more effective solutions. Greenpeace views the construction of Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant in Finland as an example of the problems on building new nuclear power.

In 2022, Greenpeace threatened to sue the European Union after it proposed to categorize nuclear power as a &quot;green&quot; technology that helps countries reduce emissions.

Greenpeace celebrated the phaseout of nuclear power in Germany in 2023. At the time, Germany was experiencing an energy crisis and relying heavily on coal and gas for power generation.

====Anti-nuclear advertisement====
In 1994, Greenpeace published an anti-nuclear newspaper advert which included a claim that nuclear facilities in Sellafield would kill 2,000 people in the next 10 years, and an image of a hydrocephalus-affected child said to be a victim of nuclear weapons testing in Kazakhstan. Advertising Standards Authority viewed the claim concerning Sellafield as unsubstantiated, lacking any scientific base. This resulted in the banning of the advert. Greenpeace did not admit fault, stating that a Kazakhstan doctor had said that the child&#x27;s condition was due to nuclear testing even though no nuclear weapons testing is performed in Sellafield.

====EDF spying conviction and appeal====
In 2011, a French court fined Électricité de France (EDF) €1.5m and jailed two senior employees for spying on Greenpeace, including hacking into Greenpeace&#x27;s computer systems. Greenpeace was awarded €500,000 in damages. Although EDF claimed that a security firm had only been employed to monitor Greenpeace, the court disagreed, jailing the head and deputy head of EDF&#x27;s nuclear security operation for three years each. EDF appealed the conviction, the company was cleared of conspiracy to spy on Greenpeace and the fine was cancelled. Two employees of the security firm, Kargus, run by a former member of France&#x27;s secret services, received sentences of three and two years respectively.

===Ozone layer and Greenfreeze===

The ozone layer surrounding the Earth absorbs significant amounts of ultraviolet radiation. A 1976 report by the US Academy of Sciences supported the ozone &quot;depletion hypothesis&quot;. Its suffering large losses from chlorinated and nitrogenous compounds was reported in 1985. Earlier studies had led some countries to enact bans on aerosol sprays, so that the Vienna Convention was signed in 1985 the Montreal Protocol was signed in 1987 to go in force two years later. The use of CFCs and HCFCs in refrigeration were and are among the banned technologies.

A German technological institute developed an ozone-safe hydrocarbon alternative refrigerant that came to a Greenpeace campaigner&#x27;s attention around 1992. The rights to the technology were donated to Greenpeace, which maintained it as an open source patent. The technology was subsequently used in Germany, then China, elsewhere in Europe, and after some years in Japan and South America, and finally in the US by 2012.

===Action against new oil licences in the UK===

In August 2023, Greenpeace highlighted the grant of new oil exploration licences in the United Kingdom, in an action in Yorkshire where they covered the facade of the home of the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, in black fabric.

==Forest campaign==
Greenpeace aims to protect intact primary forests from deforestation and degradation with the target of zero deforestation by 2020. The organization has accused several corporations, such as Unilever, Nike, KFC, Kit Kat and McDonald&#x27;s of having links to the deforestation of the tropical rainforests, resulting in policy changes in several of the companies. Greenpeace, together with other environmental NGOs, also campaigned for ten years for the EU to ban import of illegal timber. The EU decided to ban illegal timber in July 2010. As deforestation contributes to global warming, Greenpeace has demanded that REDD (Reduced Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) should be included in the climate treaty following the Kyoto Protocol.

Another Greenpeace movement concerning the rain forests is discouraging palm oil industries. The movement has been the most active in Indonesia where already are used for palm oil plantation and had plans for another by 2015. Acknowledging that mass production of palm oil may be disastrous on biodiversity of forests, Greenpeace is actively campaigning against the production, urging the industries and the government to turn to other forms of energy resources. One of the positive results of the campaign was GAR (Golden Agri-Resources), the world&#x27;s second largest palm oil production company, deciding to commit itself to forest conservation. The company signed an agreement which prevents them from developing plantations in areas where large amounts of carbon are locked up.

On the promotional side, an example of Greenpeace&#x27;s success in the area is a viral video from 2016 protesting Nestlé&#x27;s use of palm oil in Kit Kat bars. The video received over 1 million views, and resulted in a public statement by Nestlé claiming to no longer use such practices in their products. In 2018, Greenpeace released an animated short starring a fictional orangutan named &quot;Rang-tan&quot; ahead of the World Orangutan Day. In November 2018, UK&#x27;s Clearcast have denied a version of Rang-tan video as submitted by Iceland Foods Ltd.

===Removal of an ancient tree===
In June 1995, Greenpeace took a trunk of a tree from the forests of the proposed national park of Koitajoki in Ilomantsi, Finland and put it on display at exhibitions held in Austria and Germany. Greenpeace said in a press conference that the tree was originally from a logged area in the ancient forest which was supposed to be protected. Metsähallitus accused Greenpeace of theft and said that the tree was from a normal forest and had been left standing because of its old age. Metsähallitus also said that the tree had actually crashed over a road during a storm. The incident received publicity in Finland, for example in the large newspapers &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; and &quot;Ilta-Sanomat&quot;. Greenpeace replied that the tree had fallen down because the protective forest around it had been clearcut, and that they wanted to highlight the fate of old forests in general, not the fate of one particular tree. Greenpeace also highlighted that Metsähallitus admitted the value of the forest afterwards as Metsähallitus currently refers to Koitajoki as a distinctive area because of its old growth forests.

=== Wilmar International palm-oil issue ===
A 2018 investigation conducted by Greenpeace International found that Wilmar International (the world&#x27;s largest palm-oil trader) was still linked to forest destruction in the Indonesian province of Papua. The connected company, Gama, run by senior Wilmar executives, had caused deforestation twice the size of Paris. Greenpeace also called Wilmar out for breaking their 2013 commitment to end deforestation, in which they promised to incorporate organic and sustainable ways to collect palm oil. Greenpeace press releases connected Gama-produced palm oil to global brands including Procter &amp; Gamble, Nestlé and Unilever.

=== Resolute Forest Products issue ===
The logging company Resolute Forest Products sued Greenpeace several times since 2013. In 2020, a court in California ordered Resolute to pay US$816,000 to the organization to cover the costs of the legal process after the claims of the company were mostly rejected in one 2019 lawsuit. Greenpeace claims that the activity of the company is hurting the Boreal forest of Canada. Greenpeace claims that Boreal Forests contain even more carbon than Tropical Forests and therefore are very important to protecting the global climate.

==Tokyo Two==

In 2008, two Greenpeace anti-whaling activists, Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, stole a case of whale meat from a delivery depot in Aomori prefecture, Japan. Their intention was to expose what they considered embezzlement of the meat collected during whale hunts. After a brief investigation of their allegations was ended, Sato and Suzuki were charged with theft and trespassing. Amnesty International said that the arrests and following raids on Greenpeace Japan office and homes of five of Greenpeace staff members were aimed at intimidating activists and non-governmental organizations. They were convicted of theft and trespassing in September 2010 by the Aomori District Court.

==Genetically modified organisms (GMOs)==

Greenpeace has also supported the rejection of GM food from the US in famine-stricken Zambia as long as supplies of non-genetically engineered grain exist, stating that the US &quot;should follow in the European Union&#x27;s footsteps and allow aid recipients to choose their food aid, buying it locally if they wish. This practice can stimulate developing economies and creates more robust food security&quot;, adding that, &quot;if Africans truly have no other alternative, the controversial GE maize should be milled so it can&#x27;t be planted. It was this condition that allowed Zambia&#x27;s neighbours Zimbabwe and Malawi to accept it.&quot;

After Zambia banned all GM food aid, the former agricultural minister of Zambia criticized, &quot;how the various international NGOs that have spoken approvingly of the government&#x27;s action will square the body count with their various consciences.&quot; Concerning the decision of Zambia, Greenpeace has stated that, &quot;it was obvious to us that if no non-GM aid was being offered then they should absolutely accept GM food aid. But the Zambian government decided to refuse the GM food. We offered our opinion to the Zambian government and, as many governments do, they disregarded our advice.&quot;

In 2007 Greenpeace funded research by Gilles-Éric Séralini into MON 863 genetically engineered maize which concluded it caused health issues to the rats used in the study. European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and French Commission du Génie Biomoléculaire (AFBV) evaluation indicated serious methodological errors in the publication. Further research by Séralini on GMO resulted in widespread criticism of scientific fraud and retractions of his publications.

Also in 2007 Greenpeace similarly publicized results of Árpád Pusztai which were retracted too.
===Greenpeace on golden rice===
Greenpeace opposes the planned use of golden rice, a variety of &quot;Oryza sativa&quot; rice produced through genetic engineering to biosynthesize beta-carotene, a precursor of pro-vitamin A in the edible parts of rice. The addition of beta-carotene to the rice is seen as preventive to loss of sight in poverty stricken countries where golden rice is intended for distribution. According to Greenpeace, golden rice has not managed to do anything about malnutrition for 10 years during which alternative methods are already tackling malnutrition. The alternative proposed by Greenpeace is to discourage monocropping and to increase production of crops which are naturally nutrient-rich (containing other nutrients not found in golden rice in addition to beta-carotene). Greenpeace argues that resources should be spent on programs that are already working and helping to relieve malnutrition.

The renewal of these concerns coincided with the publication of a paper in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; about a version of golden rice with much higher levels of beta carotene. This &quot;golden rice 2&quot; was developed and patented by Syngenta, which provoked Greenpeace to renew its allegation that the project is driven by profit motives and to serve as propaganda aimed at increasing public opinion of GMO products.

Although Greenpeace stated that the golden rice program&#x27;s true efficiency in treating malnourished populations was its primary concern as early as 2001, statements from March and April 2005 also continued to express concern over human health and environmental safety. In particular, Greenpeace has expressed concern over the lack of safety testing being done on GMO crops such as golden rice and of &quot;playing with the lives of people...using Golden Rice to promote more GMOs&quot;.

In June 2016, a conglomeration of 107 Nobel Laureates signed an open letter urging Greenpeace to end its campaign against genetically modified crops and Golden Rice in particular. In the letter, they also called upon governments of the world to &quot;do everything in their power to oppose Greenpeace&#x27;s actions and accelerate the access of farmers to all the tools of modern biology, especially seeds improved through biotechnology.&quot; The letter states that &quot;Opposition based on emotion and dogma contradicted by data must be stopped.&quot; Greenpeace responded stating that &quot;Accusations that anyone is blocking genetically engineered &#x27;Golden&#x27; rice are false&quot; and that they support &quot;...investing in climate-resilient ecological agriculture and empowering farmers to access a balanced and nutritious diet, rather than pouring money down the drain for GE &#x27;Golden&#x27; rice.&quot;

==Toxic waste==
In July 2011, Greenpeace released its Dirty Laundry report accusing some of the world&#x27;s top fashion and sportswear brands of releasing toxic waste into China&#x27;s rivers. The report profiles the problem of water pollution resulting from the release of toxic chemicals associated with the country&#x27;s textile industry. Investigations focused on industrial wastewater discharges from two facilities in China; one belonging to the Youngor Group located on the Yangtze River Delta and the other to Well Dyeing Factory Ltd. located on a tributary of the Pearl River Delta. Scientific analysis of samples from both facilities revealed the presence of hazardous and persistent hormone disruptor chemicals, including alkylphenols, perfluorinated compounds and perfluorooctane sulfonate.
The report goes on to assert that the Youngor Group and Well Dyeing Factory Ltd. - the two companies behind the facilities - have commercial relationships with a range of major clothing brands, including Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Adidas, Bauer Hockey, Calvin Klein, Converse, Cortefiel, H&amp;M, Lacoste, Li Ning, Metersbonwe Group, Nike, Phillips-Van Heusen and Puma AG.

In 2013, Greenpeace launched the &quot;Detox Fashion&quot; campaign, which signed up some fashion brands to stop the discharge of toxic chemicals into rivers as a result of the production of their clothes. Greenpeace&#x27;s Detox Fashion campaign successfully led to commitments from several global brands to eliminate hazardous chemicals like nonylphenol ethoxylates from their supply chains. The campaign also brought attention to the broader issue of water pollution caused by textile production, urging industry-wide transparency and the adoption of zero-discharge policies.

===Guide to Greener Electronics===

In August 2006, Greenpeace released the first edition of Guide to Greener Electronics, a magazine where mobile and PC manufacturers were ranked for their green performance, mainly based on the use of toxic materials in their products and e-waste. In November 2011, the criteria were updated, as the industry had progressed since 2006, with the objective to get companies to set goals for greenhouse gas reduction, the use of renewable power up to 100 percent, producing long-lasting products free of hazardous substances and increasing sustainable practices. To ensure the transparency of the ranking the companies are assessed based only on their public information. For proving companies&#x27; policies and practices, Greenpeace uses chemical testing of products, reports from industry observers, media reports and testing of consumer programs to check if they match with their actions. Since the Guide was released in 2006, along with other similar campaigns has driven numerous improvements, when companies ranked eliminate toxic chemicals from their products and improve their recycling schemes. The last published edition of Guide to Greener Electronics was in 2017. The 2017 version included 17 major IT companies and ranked them on three criteria: energy use, resource consumption and chemical elimination.

==Save the Arctic==
In continuity of the successful campaign to reach the Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, in 2012 and 2013 protests with &quot;Save the Arctic&quot; banners were started. To stop oil- and gas-drilling, industrial fishing and military operations in the Arctic region completely, a &quot;global sanctuary in the high arctic&quot; was demanded from the World leaders at the UN General Assembly: &quot;We want them to pass a UN resolution expressing international concern for the Arctic.&quot; A resolution to protect the very vulnerable wildlife and ecosystem. 30 activists from MV &quot;Arctic Sunrise&quot; were arrested on 19 September 2013 by the Russian Coast Guard while protesting at Gazprom&#x27;s Prirazlomnaya platform. Greenpeace members were originally charged with piracy, then later downgraded to hooliganism, before being dropped altogether following the passage of an amnesty law by the Russian government.

In July 2014, Greenpeace launched a global boycott campaign to persuade Lego to cease producing toys carrying the oil company Shell&#x27;s logo in response to Shell&#x27;s plans to drill for oil in the Arctic. The organisation launched a video with over 9 million views (on YouTube alone) denouncing the impacts of this alliance. The video was entitled &quot;LEGO: Everything is NOT awesome&quot;. Lego&#x27;s partnership with Shell dates back to the 1960s, although the LEGO company created a fictional oil company called Octan. Octan has appeared in countless sets, computer and console games, can be seen at Legoland parks, and is featured as the corporation headed by the villain President Business in The Lego Movie.

===Norway===
There is a conflict over oil rigs in the Arctic Ocean between the Norwegian Government and Greenpeace. In 2013, three activists of Greenpeace got on a Statoil&#x27;s oil rig, wearing bear suits. According to a spokesman from Greenpeace Russia, they stayed on the rig for about three hours. The activists in bear suits &quot;were escorted&quot; to the shore. Statoil reportedly did not intend to file a suit against them.

Greenpeace had argued that Statoil&#x27;s drilling plans posed a threat to Bear Island, an uninhabited wildlife sanctuary that is home to rare species including polar bears, because an oil spill would be nearly impossible to clean up in the Arctic because of the harsh conditions. Greenpeace regards the petroleum activities of Statoil as &quot;illegal&quot;. Statoil denies the Greenpeace statement. According to The Maritime Executive (2014), Statoil says &quot;Statoil respects people&#x27;s right to make a legal protest, and we feel it is important to have a democratic debate around the oil industry. We have established robust plans for the operation, and feel confident they can be carried out safely and without accidents.&quot;

On 27 May 2014, Greenpeace&#x27;s ship, MV &quot;Esperanza&quot;, took over Transocean Spitsbergen, oil rig of Statoil in the Barents Sea such that it became incapable of operating. After that, the manager of Greenpeace Norway Truls Gulowsen answered a phone interview, stating that &quot;Five protesters left the rig by helicopter last night and three returned to a nearby Greenpeace ship.&quot; There were seven more protesters on the rig at the time, but the Norwegian police could not remove them immediately because the rig was a flag of convenience ship registered in the Marshall Islands and thus regarded as a ship in the open sea, as long as it did not begin drilling. On 29 May, however, the seven activists from Greenpeace were peacefully captured by Norwegian police on the rig. Soon after, according to Reuters, all the activists were set free without any fine. On 30 May, the Norwegian Coast Guard finally towed away &quot;Esperanza&quot;, though in the morning Greenpeace submitted a plea on which more than 80,000 signatures to the Norwegian Environment Minister Tine Sundtoft in Oslo were written. Norwegian government and police reportedly allowed the coast guard to tow the Greenpeace ship.

The Norwegian police stated that Statoil asked Greenpeace to stop preventing its activities, but Greenpeace ignored the warning. The police have stated that Greenpeace&#x27;s interference with the petroleum activities of Statoil was the contrary to Norwegian law and ordered Greenpeace to leave the Barents Sea site. Statoil said delays to the start of drilling cost the company about $1.26 million per day.

According to Reuters, Statoil was slated to begin drilling &quot;three oil wells in the Apollo, Atlantis and Mercury prospects in the Hoop area, [which is] some 300 km away from the mainland [of Norway]&quot; in the summer of 2014. Greenpeace has continued to criticize the big oil company for their &quot;green wash&quot;, arguing that Statoil hid the truth that it is doing the risky oil drilling by sponsoring FIRST Lego League and distracting people&#x27;s attention from the company&#x27;s project; it also argues that Statoil has to alter its attitude toward environments.

== Moratorium on deep sea mining in international waters ==
Greenpeace has joined with other environmental organizations to call for a moratorium on exploratory deep sea mining authorized by the International Seabed Authority (ISA) under the auspices of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Greenpeace says exploratory and commercial mining of polymetallic nodules could wreak havoc on the world&#x27;s oceans, which act as a carbon sink absorbing a quarter of the world&#x27;s carbon emissions each year. The organization says deep sea mining also disrupts the habitats of newly reported species, from crabs to whales to snails that survive without eating and congregate near bioluminescent thermal vents. Greenpeace has urged the International Seabed Authority to further develop UNCLOS&#x27; foundational Article 136 principle &quot;of common heritage to all mankind&quot; to revise regulations and set conservation targets. In a 2018 Greenpeace Research Laboratories report the organization stressed the importance of protecting marine biodiversity from toxins released during seabed mining for natural gas and rare metals for photovoltaic cells.

Greenpeace maintains the &quot;pro-exploitation&quot; ISA is not the appropriate authority to regulate deep sea mining (DSM). In 2019 Greenpeace activists protested outside the annual meeting of the International Seabed Authority in Jamaica, calling for a global ocean treaty to ban deep sea mining in ocean sanctuaries. Some of the activists had sailed to Jamaica aboard Greenpeace&#x27;s ship, the Esperanza, which travelled from the &quot;Lost City in the mid-Atlantic&quot;, an area Greenpeace says is threatened by exploratory mining.

== Alternative economy ==
Greenpeace promotes alternatives to the current economic and social system. According to the organization, the current system is not friendly to people and the planet, so Greenpeace tries to find a better alternative in collaboration with &quot;communities, academics and organisations&quot;.

==Ships==
Since Greenpeace was founded, seagoing ships have played a vital role in its campaigns. Greenpeace has chartered additional ships as needed. At least one non-Greenpeace owned ship was used during the organization&#x27;s 2008–11 campaign to disrupt trawling in the North Sea by placing large boulders on the seafloor and then providing local authorities with updated charts of where the boulders were placed.

===In service===
* &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; is the third vessel to bear the name. Launched in 2011, it is sometimes referred to as &quot;Rainbow Warrior III&quot;.
* MV &quot;Arctic Sunrise&quot;
* &quot;SY Witness&quot;

===Previously in service===

====First &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;====
In 1978, Greenpeace launched the original &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;, a , former fishing trawler named after the book &quot;Warriors of the Rainbow&quot;, which inspired early activist Robert Hunter on the first voyage to Amchitka. Greenpeace purchased the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; (originally launched as the &quot;Sir William Hardy&quot; in 1955) at a cost of £40,000. Volunteers restored and refitted it over a period of four months. First deployed to disrupt the hunt of the Icelandic whaling fleet, the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; quickly became a mainstay of Greenpeace campaigns. Between 1978 and 1985, crew members also engaged in direct action against the ocean-dumping of toxic and radioactive waste, the grey seal hunt in Orkney and nuclear testing in the Pacific. In May 1985, the vessel was instrumental for &#x27;Operation Exodus&#x27;, the evacuation of about 300 Rongelap Atoll islanders whose home had been contaminated with nuclear fallout from a US nuclear test two decades earlier which had never been cleaned up and was still having severe health effects on the locals.

Later in 1985 the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; was to lead a flotilla of protest vessels into the waters surrounding Moruroa atoll, site of French nuclear testing. The sinking of the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; occurred when the French government secretly bombed the ship in Auckland harbour on orders from François Mitterrand himself. This killed Dutch freelance photographer Fernando Pereira, who thought it was safe to enter the boat to get his photographic material after a first small explosion, but drowned as a result of a second, larger explosion. The attack was a public relations disaster for France after it was quickly exposed by the New Zealand police. The French Government in 1987 agreed to pay New Zealand compensation of NZ$13 million and formally apologised for the bombing. The French Government also paid ₣2.3 million compensation to the family of the photographer. Later, in 2001, when the Institute of Cetacean Research of Japan called Greenpeace &quot;eco-terrorists&quot;, Gert Leipold, then executive director of Greenpeace, detested the claim, saying &quot;calling non-violent protest terrorism insults those who were injured or killed in the attacks of real terrorists, including Fernando Pereira, killed by State terrorism in the 1985 attack on the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;&quot;.

====Second &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;====
In 1989 Greenpeace commissioned a replacement Rainbow Warrior vessel, sometimes referred to as &quot;Rainbow Warrior II&quot;. It retired from service on 16 August 2011, to be replaced by the third generation vessel. In 2005 the &quot;Rainbow Warrior II&quot; ran aground on and damaged the Tubbataha Reef in the Philippines while inspecting the reef for coral bleaching. Greenpeace was fined US$7,000 for damaging the reef and agreed to pay the fine saying they felt responsible for the damage, although Greenpeace stated that the Philippines government had given it outdated charts. The park manager of Tubbataha appreciated the quick action Greenpeace took to assess the damage to the reef.

====Others====
* MV &quot;Sirius&quot;
* MV &quot;Solo&quot;
* MV &quot;Greenpeace&quot;
* MV &quot;Gondwana&quot;
* MV &quot;Beluga&quot; (in German)
* MV &quot;Esperanza&quot;

==Reactions and responses to Greenpeace activities==
Lawsuits have been filed against Greenpeace for lost profits, reputation damage and &quot;sailormongering&quot;. The latter case, brought under a law not prosecuted since 1890, was widely viewed as an attempt at revenge by the Bush administration for Greenpeace&#x27;s criticism of its environmental policies. The case was dismissed when the prosecution rested, having failed to prove its case. In 2004 it was revealed that the Australian government was willing to offer a subsidy to Southern Pacific Petroleum on the condition that the oil company would take legal action against Greenpeace, which had campaigned against the Stuart Oil Shale Project.

In March 2024, a lawsuit of Total, following Greenpeace publication about the underestimate of Total&#x27;s GHG emissions in 2019, was dismissed in the Parisian court. Greenpeace said the decision is important because there are other similar cases pending in courts.

Some corporations, such as Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Électricité de France have reacted to Greenpeace campaigns by spying on Greenpeace activities and infiltrating Greenpeace offices. Greenpeace activists have also been targets of phone tapping, death threats, violence and even state terrorism in the case of the bombing of the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;.

On 19 May 2023, Russia&#x27;s Prosecutor-General&#x27;s Office designated Greenpeace as an undesirable organisation, accusing it of interfering with Russia&#x27;s internal affairs, undermining the country&#x27;s economy, and financing the activities of Russian organizations recognized as &quot;foreign agents&quot;.

==Criticism==
=== By Patrick Moore ===
Patrick Moore, an early Greenpeace member, left the organization in 1986 when it, according to Moore, decided to support a universal ban on chlorine in drinking water. Moore has argued that Greenpeace today is motivated by politics rather than science and that none of his &quot;fellow directors had any formal science education&quot;. Bruce Cox, Director of Greenpeace Canada, responded that Greenpeace has never demanded a universal chlorine ban and that Greenpeace does not oppose use of chlorine in drinking water or in pharmaceutical uses, adding that &quot;Mr. Moore is alone in his recollection of a fight over chlorine and/or use of science as his reason for leaving Greenpeace.&quot; Paul Watson, an early member of Greenpeace has said that Moore &quot;uses his status as a so-called co-founder of Greenpeace to give credibility to his accusations. I am also a co-founder of Greenpeace and I have known Patrick Moore for 35 years.[...] Moore makes accusations that have no basis in fact&quot;.

Patrick Moore also reversed his position on nuclear power in 1976, first opposing it and now supporting it. In Australian newspaper &quot;The Age&quot;, he writes &quot;Greenpeace is wrong—we must consider nuclear power&quot;. He argues that any realistic plan to reduce reliance on fossil fuels or greenhouse gas emissions needs increased use of nuclear energy. Phil Radford, executive director of Greenpeace US responded that nuclear energy is too risky, takes too long to build to address climate change, and claims that most countries, including the U.S., could shift to nearly 100% renewable energy while phasing out nuclear power by 2050.

In 2013, Moore criticized Greenpeace&#x27;s stance on golden rice, an issue where Moore has been joined by other environmentalists such as Mark Lynas, stating that Greenpeace has &quot;waged a campaign of misinformation, trashed the scientists who are working to bring Golden Rice to the people who need it, and supported the violent destruction of Golden Rice field trials.&quot;

===Brent Spar tanker===
Research published in natural science journal &quot;Nature&quot; accused Greenpeace of not caring for facts when it criticized the dumping of the Brent Spar tanker, and accused the group of exaggerating the volume of oil that was stored in the tanker. Greenpeace had claimed that the tanker contained 5,500 tonnes of crude oil, while Shell estimated it only contained 50 tonnes. However, the measurements had been made under duress during a protest occupation of the platform, since Shell had refused permission, and Greenpeace activists had been under attack by water cannons and the like. The BBC issued an apology to Greenpeace for having reported that the NGO lied.

Shell UK took three years to evaluate the disposal options, concluding that the disposal of the tanker in the deep ocean was the &quot;Best Practicable Environmental Option&quot; (BPEO), an option which gained some support within some portion of the scientific community, as it was found by some to be of &quot;negligible&quot; environmental impact. British government and Oslo and Paris Commissions (OSPAR) accepted the solution.

The resulting NGO campaign against Shell&#x27;s proposals included letters, boycotts which escalated to vandalism in Germany, and lobbying at intergovernmental conferences. Binding moratoriums supporting Greenpeace&#x27;s, ecosystem protection, and the precautionary principle position were issued in more than one intergovernmental meeting, and at the 1998 OSPAR Convention, WWF presented a study of toxic effects on deep sea ecosystems. The meeting confirmed a general prohibition on ocean dumping. Shell had transported the rig to the dumping site, but in the last hours canceled the operation and announced that it had failed in communicating its plans sufficiently to the public, admitting they had underestimated the strength of public opinion. In January 1998, Shell issued a new BPEO indicating recycling the rig as a quay in Norway.

In 1999, the Brent Spar container was decommissioned and one side issue that emerged was that the legs of the structure were found to contain cold-water coral species (&quot;Lophelia pertusa&quot;). As a result, the possibility was suggested of keeping the legs of such platforms on the sea bed in future, to serve as habitat. A Greenpeace representative opposed the suggestion, citing the fact that the reefs formed by the coral are at risk, not the coral itself, and that such a move would not promote development of such reefs, and expose coral species to toxic substances found in oil. &quot;If I was to dump a car in a wood, moss would grow on it, and if I was lucky a bird may even nest in it. But this is not justification to fill our forests with disused cars,&quot; said Greenpeace campaigner Simon Reddy.

===Pascal Husting commute===
In 2013 reports noted that Pascal Husting, the director of Greenpeace International&#x27;s &quot;international programme&quot; was commuting to work by plane, despite Greenpeace&#x27;s activism to reduce air travel due to carbon footprint. Greenpeace has said &quot;the growth in aviation is ruining our chances of stopping dangerous climate change&quot;. After a &quot;public uproar&quot; Greenpeace announced that Husting would commute by train.

===Nazca Lines===
In December 2014, Greenpeace activists damaged rock related to the Nazca Lines in Peru while setting up a banner within the lines of one of the famed geoglyphs, and there were concerns that the harm might be irreparable. The activists damaged an area around the hummingbird by walking near the glyph without regulation footwear. Access to the area around the lines is strictly prohibited and special shoes must be worn to avoid damaging the UN World Heritage site. Greenpeace said the activists were &quot;absolutely careful to protect the Nazca lines,&quot; but this is contradicted by video and photographs showing the activists wearing conventional shoes (not special protective shoes) while walking on the site.

Greenpeace has apologized to the Peruvian people, but Loise Jamie Castillo, Peru&#x27;s Vice Minister of Cultural Heritage called the apology &quot;a joke&quot;, because Greenpeace refused to identify the vandals or accept responsibility. Culture Minister Diana Álvarez-Calderón said that evidence gathered during an investigation by the government will be used as part of a legal suit against Greenpeace. &quot;The damage done is irreparable and the apologies offered by the environmental group aren&#x27;t enough,&quot; she said at a news conference. By January 2015, Greenpeace had presented statements of four members of the NGO involved in the action.

===Anti-whaling campaign in Norway in the 1990s===
During the 1990s Greenpeace conducted many anti-whaling expeditions in Norway. Critics have said that Greenpeace only campaigned against whaling to gain economic donations from the US economy, and it had little to do with saving the environment or the lives of the whales. For example, shark hunting is a more pressing issue, but since sharks are widely feared in the United States, activism to help sharks does not receive as much financial support. Greenpeace has rejected this claim. However, in Norwegian Newspaper Dagbladet on 11 April 2015, Kumi Naidoo admitted that the anti-whale campaign was a &quot;miscalculation&quot;. Greenpeace holds that whaling was only resumed by Norway after the IWC ban because of political election motives, and faces many explicit hurdles, including decreased demand in Japan and toxic chemical contamination.

===Open letter from Nobel laureates===
In June 2016, 107 Nobel laureates signed an open letter urging Greenpeace to end its opposition to genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The letter stated:We urge Greenpeace and its supporters to re-examine the experience of farmers and consumers worldwide with crops and foods improved through biotechnology, recognize the findings of authoritative scientific bodies and regulatory agencies, and abandon their campaign against &quot;GMOs&quot; in general and Golden Rice in particular. Scientific and regulatory agencies around the world have repeatedly and consistently found crops and foods improved through biotechnology to be as safe as, if not safer than those derived from any other method of production. There has never been a single confirmed case of a negative health outcome for humans or animals from their consumption. Their environmental impacts have been shown repeatedly to be less damaging to the environment, and a boon to global biodiversity. [...] We call upon governments of the world to [...] do everything in their power to oppose Greenpeace&#x27;s actions and accelerate the access of farmers to all the tools of modern biology, especially seeds improved through biotechnology. [...] Opposition based on emotion and dogma contradicted by data must be stopped.Greenpeace responded stating that &quot;Accusations that anyone is blocking genetically engineered &#x27;Golden&#x27; rice are false&quot; and that they support &quot;investing in climate-resilient ecological agriculture and empowering farmers to access a balanced and nutritious diet, rather than pouring money down the drain for GE &#x27;Golden&#x27; rice.&quot;

=== Efforts to curb Arctic Oil Exploration ===
In December 2020, Norway&#x27;s Supreme Court refused to interfere in the work of ongoing oil exploration endeavors which was challenged jointly by Greenpeace and Nature and Youth Norway on the ground that the activity related to oil explorations violate human rights due to its contributing aspect towards carbon emission. The ruling said that the permission granted during 2016 will remain valid as it was not found to violate either &#x27;Norwegian Constitution&#x27;s right&#x27; or &#x27;European Convention on Human Rights&#x27;. Greta Thunberg reportedly contributed $29,000 as the lawsuit cost on behalf of the plaintiff Greenpeace and Nature and Youth Norway.

<text>George Hoyt Whipple (August 28, 1878 – February 1, 1976) was an American physician, pathologist, biomedical researcher, and medical school educator and administrator. Whipple shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1934 with George Richards Minot and William Parry Murphy &quot;for their discoveries concerning liver therapy in cases of anemia&quot;. This makes Whipple the first of several Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Rochester.

==Early life==
Whipple was born to Ashley Cooper Whipple and Frances Anna Hoyt in Ashland, New Hampshire. Ashley Cooper Whipple was a physician, and his father (George&#x27;s paternal grandfather) was a physician and President of the New Hampshire Medical Society. Whipple&#x27;s father died from pneumonia or typhoid fever when George was just shy of two years old. His maternal grandfather also died when Whipple was two years old, and his paternal grandfather died a year later. This left Whipple to be raised by his mother, Frances, and grandmother, Frances Moody Hoyt, who impressed on him the value of hard work and education.

Whipple attended Andover prep school and began attending Yale University as an undergraduate in 1896, earning A.B. degree in 1900. During these years, he developed as an outdoorsman, an affinity he would hold lifelong. He wrote in his autobiography about growing up in a lake district, &quot;I feel very fortunate that I grew up in the country...I became interested in wild life and camping, also hiking, snowshoeing, skating, bob sledding, canoeing, fishing, hunting—all this was an essential part of my life&quot;. He even credited his love for the outdoors as a contributor to his successes in work, study, and teaching. In the summers of prep school and undergrad, he worked at a drugstore and at Squam Lake and Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire providing help and ferry services to the tourists and campers. Of his summer experiences, Whipple said, &quot;I sometimes think I learned as much during the summer work periods as during the school terms.&quot;

==Education==
As an undergraduate, he became a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity, and proved to be a prize-winning gymnast, oarsman, and an outstanding science student. His excellence in science was exemplified by his election to Sigma Xi honor society and graduation with senior honors. The interactions Whipple had with biochemists Russell Henry Chittenden and Lafayette Mendel during his senior year at Yale left an indelible mark on his life and career. In his autobiography, Whipple describes Mendel as &quot;an unusual man who exerted a strong influence on me ... work with him was exciting and never to be forgotten&quot;.

With a shortage of funds to finance further education, Whipple took a year off after graduating Yale. During this year, he worked at Dr. Holbrook Military School in Ossining, New York, teaching mathematics and science, and serving as an athletic coach.

In 1901, under the advice, persuasion, and guidance of his mother, Whipple attended medical school at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. He received his M.D. degree in 1905. To gain experience and subsidize his medical school studies, Whipple applied for and was accepted to a teaching assistantship in John J. Abel&#x27;s Department of Physiological Chemistry. Later, his performance in his first year anatomy course earned him a second-year appointment as a student instructor in anatomy. During this time, his interest in histology developed. Under the mentorship of William Welch, Eugene Opie, and William McCallum, Whipple was inspired to correlate clinical illness and disease, to the tissue findings discovered on autopsy. Together, McCallum and Welch conspired to offer Whipple a position as junior member of the pathology department with the hope it would lead to Whipple become a pediatric pathologist. Ultimately, Whipple accepted the position which shaped his career aspirations to become a pathologist.

==Career==
In 1905, Whipple joined the pathology department at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine as an assistant in pathology. He was promoted successively to Assistant, Instructor, Associate and associate professor in pathology until he left in 1914. During this time, he spent a year in Panama at Ancon Hospital as a pathologist. In Panama, he worked with Samuel Darling, a resident pathologist, and General Gorgas to gain experience in tropical diseases. This experience afforded him the opportunity to study massive hemolysis associated with blackwater fever. Before returning to Johns Hopkins School of Medicine after his time in Panama, Whipple traveled to Europe and spent time in the laboratories of Krehl and Morawitz in Heidelberg, where he learned about anemia in rabbits. In 1911, Whipple went to Vienna to study hepatic portal vein blood flow and its effects on hepatic functions in the dog with Hans Meyer.

In 1914, at 34 years old, Whipple married Katherine Ball Waring of Charleston, South Carolina. They had two children. He was also appointed Professor of Research Medicine, and Director of the Hooper Foundation for Medical Research at the University of California San Francisco medical school. He was dean of that medical school in 1920 and 1921.

In 1921, through the persistence of University of Rochester President Benjamin Rush Rhees, Whipple agreed to become a Professor and Chairman of Pathology, and the founding Dean of the yet-to-be-built medical school (URMC). Rhees was so determined to recruit Whipple, he personally flew to UC San Francisco to offer him the opportunity to build the medical school from the ground up. Whipple found this offer attractive because it would fulfil his passion to create a program which fostered an exchange between clinical and preclinical disciplines. His vision for the school included housing the medical school and hospital at the same site to facilitate this exchange. The first students entered URMC in 1925.

Whipple categorically discriminated against African-American students during his time as dean, and would send a form letter to applicants rejecting their admission and requesting they apply elsewhere. In 1939, A commission of the New York State Legislature found this practice to be in violation of New York&#x27;s anti-discrimination laws, after which the URMC began to admit African-American medical students.

==Retirement==
In 1953, at 75 years old, Whipple retired from the Deanship, and retirement from the university would follow in 1955. He was remembered as a superb teacher. In his autobiography, &quot;A Dozen Doctors&quot;, Whipple wrote, &quot;I would be remembered as a teacher&quot;. He spent his retirement years dabbling in pathology department and medical school activities at the University of Rochester, but returned to his outdoors-man roots, filling his time with pheasant hunting, salmon fishing on the Margaree River, and tarpon fishing off the coast in Florida.

Whipple died in 1976 at the age of 97 and his ashes were scattered in Rochester&#x27;s Mount Hope Cemetery.

Though he was not related to Allen Whipple, who described the Whipple procedure and Whipple&#x27;s triad, the two were lifelong friends. The Whipples also had a deep friendship with George Eastman, founder of Rochester-based Eastman Kodak.

==Whipple&#x27;s research==
Over the course of his career, Whipple authored or co-authored more than 300 publications.

Whipple&#x27;s research interests during his career primarily included anemia and the physiology and pathology of the liver. But he also researched and made significant contributions to tuberculosis, pancreatitis, chloroform poisoning in animals, the metabolism of bile pigments and iron, the constituents of the bile, and the regeneration of plasma protein, protein metabolism, and the stroma of the red blood cells.

One of his first publications described the role of the lungs, lymphatic system, and gastrointestinal tract in the spread of tubercle bacillus causing tuberculosis. Another one of his early publications described autopsy results from a patient with an accumulation of fatty acids in the walls of the small intestine and lymph nodes. He named this abnormality lipodystrophia intestinalis (intestinal lipodystrophy), and correctly pointed to the bacterial cause of the lipid deposits, resulting in the disease being named Whipple&#x27;s disease.

When Whipple first joined Johns Hopkins School of Medicine as an assistant, he worked under William H. Welch, focusing on the repair and regeneration of liver cells. His research in dogs demonstrated that liver cells had an almost unlimited ability to regenerate. Through his chloroform liver injury studies, Whipple demonstrated that the liver was the site of fibrinogen synthesis. His research elucidated the route by which bile pigments enter circulation and produce jaundice in various parts of the body.

Later, he studied bile pigments and their production outside the liver by way of bile fistulas at the Hooper Foundation at UC San Francisco. His interests soon extended to understanding the production of hemoglobin to gain a better understand of how it is metabolized into bile pigments. Co-authored with Hooper, Whipple published 12 papers, from 1915 to 1917, reporting the following:
* Bile pigment bilirubin was a breakdown product of muscle hemoglobin, though red blood cell hemoglobin was the major normal source. 
* Bile pigment was not reabsorbed and reused in the production of new red blood cells. 
* The heme moiety of hemoglobin could be converted to bilirubin in both the pleural and peritoneal cavities, in addition to the liver.
* Normal liver function was essential for the excretion of bilirubin.
* The curve of red blood cell regeneration in anemia, as influenced by dietary factors, like sugar, amino acids and starvation.

At the University of Rochester, Whipple&#x27;s research focus became studying the various factors in diets which contributed to recovery of long-term anemia, particularly in anemic dogs. Along with his research assistant, Frieda Robscheit-Robbins (formally Frieda Robbins), they co-authored 21 publications, from 1925 to 1930, reporting the following:
* Circulating plasma and hemoglobin volumes
* The effects of dietary and other factors on bile salt production and secretion
* Measurements of blood fibrinogen
* The effects of diet, hemorrhage, liver injury, and other factors on plasma fibrinogen levels
* Blood regeneration following simple anemia
Whipple and Robscheit-Robbins were regarded as having one of the &quot;great creative partnerships in medicine&quot;.

In his landmark studies, published as a series &quot;Blood Regeneration in Severe Anemia&quot; beginning in 1925, Whipple demonstrated that raw liver fed to anemic dogs was the most effective diet additive for reversing the anemia by boosting the production of red blood cells. He would go on to show that foods derived from animal tissue, and cooked apricots also had a positive effect of increasing red blood cells during anemia. Based on these data, Whipple associated the iron content in these dietary factors to the potency of red blood cell regeneration. This data led directly to successful liver treatment of pernicious anemia by George R. Minot and William P. Murphy, despite the main therapeutic mechanism being through B12 rather than iron. This was a remarkable discovery since previously, pernicious anemia was invariably fatal at a young age. For his contribution to this body of work, he was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1934 along with Minot and Murphy.

In 1937, Whipple collaborated with William B. Hawkins to determine the life-span of the red blood cell in dogs. Simultaneously, with the advent of radioactive iron, Whipple, Paul F. Hahn, and William F. Bale collaborated to study iron absorption and utilization. They demonstrated that iron absorption was highly regulated in the small intestine and was influenced by the amount of iron stores in the body. They also demonstrated that insignificant amounts of iron were normally excreted or lost in the urine, feces, or bile. During this time, Whipple also formulated his theory on &quot;the dynamic equilibrium between blood and tissue proteins&quot; based on earlier plasmapheresis experiments he had performed (in the early 1930s) which demonstrated the importance of dietary protein on production of plasma proteins. This formed the foundation of research into mammalian protein metabolism, and led Rudolf Schoenheimer to write &quot;The Dynamic State of the Body Constituents,&quot; marking the modern era of biochemistry and biology.

Between 1939 and 1943 Leon L. Miller and Whipple collaborated to study the hepato-toxic effects of chloroform anesthesia on dogs. They found that dogs in a protein depleted state sustained lethal liver injury from within anesthesia fifteen minutes; but that feeding these depleted dogs a protein rich meal, particularly rich in L-methionine or L-cystine, prior to anesthesia was protective. This and other studies, led Whipple to the conclusion that S-containing amino acids are protective against liver against toxic agents.

During World War II, Whipple tested combinations of dietary amino acids, administered, orally or parenterally, and their effects on plasma protein synthesis. He was able to characterize amino acid mixtures that could satisfy the metabolic requirements necessary to maintain weight, nitrogen balance, and plasma protein and hemoglobin regeneration in the dog. This would ultimately led to human clinical trials which demonstrated that these amino acid mixtures, along with enzymatic digest of casein, could sustain nourishment in patients who could not intake nutrients through the normal gastrointestinal route for extended periods. Intravenous nutrition, referred to as parenteral nutrition, is routinely used today.

== Nobel Prize, honors and distinctions ==
Whipple shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1934 with George R. Minot and William P. Murphy &quot;for their discoveries concerning liver therapy in cases of anemia&quot;.

In presenting the Nobel Prize, Professor I. Holmgren of the Nobel committee observed that &quot;Of the three prize winners, it was Whipple who first occupied himself with the investigations for which the prize is now awarded. ... Whipple&#x27;s experiments were planned exceedingly well, and carried out very accurately, and consequently their results can lay claim to absolute reliability. These investigations and results of Whipple&#x27;s gave Minot and Murphy the idea that an experiment could be made to see whether favorable results might also be obtained in the case of pernicious anemia...by making use of the foods of the kind that Whipple had found to yield favorable results in his experiments regarding anemia from loss of blood.&quot;

Whipple received honorary doctorates from several American and international Universities, including the Universities of Athens and Glasgow. In 1930, along with Minot, he received the Popular Science Monthly Gold Medal and Annual Award. In 1934, he was awarded the William Wood Gerhard Gold Medal of the Pathological Society of Philadelphia.

He also was a member of the following organizations:
* Rockefeller Foundation, Trustee 
* Association of Physicians in Vienna, Corresponding Member 
* Royal Society of Physicians in Budapest
* European Society of Haematology
* British Medical Association, Foreign Corresponding Member. 
* Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland, Honorary Member 
* American Philosophical Society, Honorary Member
* Society of Experimental Biology and Medicine, Honorary Member 
* Board of Scientific Directors of the Rockefeller Institute, Member
* Board of Trustees of the Rockefeller Institute, Member; Vice-chairman; and Trustee Emeritus

<text>The Göktürks, Türks, Celestial Turks or Blue Turks (; ) were a Turkic people in medieval Inner Asia. The Göktürks, under the leadership of Bumin Qaghan (d. 552) and his sons, succeeded the Rouran Khaganate as the main power in the region and established the First Turkic Khaganate, one of several nomadic dynasties that would shape the future geolocation, culture, and dominant beliefs of Turkic peoples.

==Etymology==
===Origin===

The common name &quot;Göktürk&quot; emerged from the misreading of the word &quot;Kök&quot; meaning Ashina, the endonym of the ruling clan of the historical ethnic group which was attested as , or . It is generally accepted that the name &quot;Türk&quot; is ultimately derived from the Old-Turkic migration-term 𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰜 &quot;Türük&quot;/&quot;Törük&quot;, which means &#x27;created, born&#x27;.

They were known in Middle Chinese historical sources as the &quot;Tūjué&quot; (; reconstructed in Middle Chinese as romanized: *&quot;dwət-kuɑt&quot; &gt; &quot;tɦut-kyat&quot;).

The ethnonym was also recorded in various other Middle Asian languages, such as Sogdian *&quot;Türkit ~ Türküt&quot;, &quot;tr&#x27;wkt&quot;, &quot;trwkt&quot;, &quot;turkt&quot; &gt; &quot;trwkc&quot;, &quot;trukč&quot;; Khotanese Saka &quot;Ttūrka&quot;/&quot;Ttrūka&quot;, Rouran &quot;to̤ro̤x&quot;/&quot;türǖg&quot;, Korean &quot;돌궐&quot;/&quot;Dolgwol&quot;, and Old Tibetan &quot;Drugu&quot;.

===Definition===
According to Chinese sources, Tūjué meant &quot;combat helmet&quot; (), reportedly because the shape of the Altai Mountains, where they lived, was similar to a combat helmet. Róna-Tas (1991) pointed to a Khotanese-Saka word, &quot;tturakä&quot; &quot;lid&quot;, semantically stretchable to &quot;helmet&quot;, as a possible source for this folk etymology, yet Golden thinks this connection requires more data.

Göktürk is sometimes interpreted as either &quot;Celestial Turk&quot; or &quot;Blue Turk&quot; (i.e. because sky blue is associated with celestial realms). This is consistent with &quot;the cult of heavenly ordained rule&quot; which was a recurrent element of Altaic political culture and as such may have been imbibed by the Göktürks from their predecessors in Mongolia. &quot;Blue&quot; is traditionally associated with the East as it used in the cardinal system of central Asia, thus meaning &quot;Turks of the East&quot;. The name of the ruling Ashina clan may derive from the Khotanese Saka term for &quot;deep blue&quot;, &quot;āššɪna&quot;.

According to the American Heritage Dictionary, the word Türk meant &quot;strong&quot; in Old Turkic; though Gerhard Doerfer supports this theory, Gerard Clauson points out that &quot;the word Türk is never used in the generalized sense of &#x27;strong&#x27;&quot; and that the noun Türk originally meant &quot;&#x27;the culminating point of maturity&#x27; (of a fruit, human being, etc.), but more often used as an [adjective] meaning (of a fruit) &#x27;just fully ripe&#x27;; (of a human being) &#x27;in the prime of life, young, and vigorous&#x27;&quot;. Hakan Aydemir (2022) also contends that Türk originally did not mean &quot;strong, powerful&quot; but &quot;gathered; united, allied, confederated&quot; and was derived from Pre-Proto-Turkic verb *türü &quot;heap up, collect, gather, assemble&quot;.

The name as used by the Göktürks only applied to themselves, the Göktürk khanates, and their subjects. The Göktürks did not consider other Turkic speaking groups such as the Uyghurs, Tiele, and Kyrgyz to be Türks. In the Orkhon inscriptions, the Toquz Oghuz and the Yenisei Kyrgyz are not referred to as Türks. Similarly, the Uyghurs called themselves Uyghurs and used &quot;Türk&quot; exclusively for the Göktürks, whom they portrayed as enemy aliens in their royal inscriptions. The Khazars may have kept the Göktürk tradition alive by claiming descent from the Ashina. When tribal leaders built their khanates, ruling over assorted tribes and tribal unions, the collected people identified themselves politically with the leadership. Turk became the designation for all subjects of the Turk empires. Nonetheless, subordinate tribes and tribal unions retained their original names, identities, and social structures. Memory of the Göktürks and the Ashina had faded by the turn of the millennium. The Karakhanids, Qocho Uyghurs, and Seljuks did not claim descent from the Göktürks.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

The Göktürk rulers originated from the Ashina clan, who were first attested to in 439. The &quot;Book of Sui&quot; reports that in that year, on 18 October, the Tuoba ruler Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei overthrew Juqu Mujian of the Northern Liang in eastern Gansu, whence 500 Ashina families fled northwest to the Rouran Khaganate in the vicinity of Gaochang.

According to the &quot;Book of Zhou&quot; and &quot;History of the Northern Dynasties&quot;, the Ashina clan was a component of the Xiongnu confederation, specifically, the Northern Xiongnu tribes or southern Xiongnu &quot;who settled along the northern Chinese frontier&quot;, according to Edwin G. Pulleyblank. However, this view is contested. Göktürks were also posited as having originated from an obscure Suo state (索國) (MC: *&quot;sâk&quot;) which was situated north of the Xiongnu and had been founded by the Sakas or Xianbei. According to the &quot;Book of Sui&quot; and the &quot;Tongdian&quot;, they were &quot;mixed Hu (barbarians)&quot; () from Pingliang (平涼), now in Gansu, Northwest China. Pointing to the Ashina&#x27;s association with the Northern tribes of the Xiongnu, some researchers (e.g. Duan, Lung, etc.) proposed that Göktürks belonged in particular to the Tiele confederation, likewise Xiongnu-associated, by ancestral lineage. However, Lee and Kuang (2017) state that Chinese sources do not describe the Ashina-led Göktürks s descending from the Dingling or belonging to the Tiele confederation.

Chinese sources linked the Hu on their northern borders to the Xiongnu just as Graeco-Roman historiographers called the Pannonian Avars, Huns and Hungarians &quot;Scythians&quot;. Such archaizing was a common literary topos, implying similar geographic origins and nomadic lifestyle but not direct filiation.

As part of the heterogeneous Rouran Khaganate, the Turks lived for generations north of the Altai Mountains, where they &#x27;engaged in metal working for the Rouran&#x27;. According to Denis Sinor, the rise to power of the Ashina clan represented an &#x27;internal revolution&#x27; in the Rouran Khaganate rather than an external conquest.

According to Charles Holcombe, the early Turk population was rather heterogeneous and many of the names of Turk rulers, including the two founding members, are not even Turkic. This is supported by evidence from the Orkhon inscriptions, which include several non-Turkic lexemes, possibly representing Uralic or Yeniseian words. Peter Benjamin Golden points out that the khaghans of the Turkic Khaganate, the Ashina, who were of an undetermined ethnic origin, adopted Iranian and Tokharian (or non-Altaic) titles. German Turkologist W.-E. Scharlipp points out that many common terms in Turkic are Iranian in origin. Whatever language the Ashina may have spoken originally, they and those they ruled would all speak Turkic, in a variety of dialects, and create, in a broadly defined sense, a common culture.

===Expansion===
The Göktürks reached their peak in the late 6th century and began to invade the Sui dynasty of China. However, the war ended due to the division of Turkic nobles and their civil war for the throne of Khagan. With the support of Emperor Wen of Sui, Yami Qaghan won the competition. However, the Göktürk empire was divided to Eastern and Western empires. Weakened by the civil war, Yami Qaghan declared allegiance to the Sui dynasty. When Sui began to decline, Shibi Khagan began to assault its territory and even surrounded Emperor Yang of Sui in Siege of Yanmen (615 AD) with 100,000 cavalry troops. After the collapse of the Sui dynasty, the Göktürks intervened in the ensuing Chinese civil wars, providing support to the northeastern rebel Liu Heita against the rising Tang in 622 and 623. Liu enjoyed a long string of success but was finally routed by Li Shimin and other Tang generals and executed. The Tang dynasty was then established.

=== Conquest by the Tang ===
Although the Göktürk Khaganate once provided support to the Tang dynasty in the early period of the civil war during the collapse of the Sui dynasty, the conflicts between the Göktürks and Tang finally broke out when Tang was gradually reunifying China proper. The Göktürks began to attack and raid the northern border of the Tang Empire and once marched their main force of 100,000 soldiers to Chang&#x27;an, the capital of Tang. The emperor Taizong of the Tang, in spite of the limited resources at his disposal, managed to turn them back. Later, Taizong sent his troops to Mongolia and defeated the main force of Göktürk army in Battle of Yinshan four years later and captured Illig Qaghan in 630 AD. With the submission of the Turkic tribes, the Tang conquered the Mongolian Plateau. From then on, the Eastern Turks were subjugated to China.

After a vigorous court debate, Emperor Taizong decided to pardon the Göktürk nobles and offered them positions as imperial guards. However, the proposition was ended by a plan for the assassination of the emperor. On 19 May 639 Ashina Jiesheshuai and his tribesmen directly assaulted Emperor Taizong of Tang at Jiucheng Palace (, in present-day Linyou County, Baoji, Shaanxi). However, they did not succeed and fled to the north, but were caught by pursuers near the Wei River and were killed. Ashina Hexiangu was exiled to Lingbiao. After the unsuccessful raid of Ashina Jiesheshuai, on 13 August 639 Taizong installed Qilibi Khan and ordered the settled Turkic people to follow him north of the Yellow River to settle between the Great Wall of China and the Gobi Desert. However, many Göktürk generals still remained loyal in service to the Tang Empire.

===Revival===

In 679, Ashide Wenfu and Ashide Fengzhi, who were Turkic leaders of the Chanyu Protectorate (單于大都護府), declared Ashina Nishufu as qaghan and revolted against the Tang dynasty. In 680, Pei Xingjian defeated Ashina Nishufu and his army. Ashina Nishufu was killed by his men. Ashide Wenfu made Ashina Funian a qaghan and again revolted against the Tang dynasty. Ashide Wenfu and Ashina Funian surrendered to Pei Xingjian. On 5 December 681, 54 Göktürks, including Ashide Wenfu and Ashina Funian, were publicly executed in the Eastern Market of Chang&#x27;an. In 682, Ilterish Qaghan and Tonyukuk revolted and occupied Heisha Castle (northwest of present-day Hohhot, Inner Mongolia) with the remnants of Ashina Funian&#x27;s men. The restored Göktürk Khaganate intervened in the war between Tang and Khitan tribes. However, after the death of Bilge Qaghan, the Göktürks could no longer subjugate other Turk tribes in the grasslands. In 744, allied with the Tang dynasty, the Uyghur Khaganate defeated the last Göktürk Khaganate and controlled the Mongolian Plateau.

==Rulers==

The Ashina tribe of the Göktürks ruled the First Turkic Khaganate, which then split into the Eastern Turkic Khaganate and the Western Turkic Khaganate, and later the Second Turkic Khaganate, controlling much of Central Asia and the Mongolian Plateau between 552 and 745. The rulers were named &quot;Khagan&quot; (Qaghan).

==Religion==
Their religion was polytheistic. The great god was the sky god, Tengri, who dispensed the viaticum for the journey of life (qut) and fortune (ulug) and watched over the cosmic order and the political and social order. People prayed to him and sacrificed to him a white horse as the offering. The khagan, who came from him and derived his authority from him, was raised on a felt saddle to meet him. Tengri issued decrees, brought pressure to bear on human beings, and enforced capital punishment, often by striking the offender with lightning. The many secondary powers – sometimes named deities, sometimes spirits or simply said to be sacred, and almost always associated with Tengri – were the Earth, the Mountain, Water, the Springs, and the Rivers; the possessors of all objects, particularly of the land and the waters of the nation; trees, cosmic axes, and sources of life; fire, the symbol of the family and alterego of the shaman; the stars, particularly the sun and the moon, the Pleiades, and Venus, whose image changes over time; Umay, the great goddess who is none other than the goddess of the earth and placenta; the threshold and the doorjamb; personifications of Time, the Road, Desire, etc.; heroes and ancestors embodied in the banner, in tablets with inscriptions, and in idols; and spirits wandering or fixed in Penates or in all kinds of holy objects. These and other powers have an uneven force which increases as objects accumulate, as trees form a forest, stones form a cairn, arrows form a quiver, and drops of water form a lake.

==Genetics==

A genetic study published in &quot;Nature&quot; in May 2018 examined the remains of four elite Türk soldiers buried between ca. 300 AD and 700 AD. 50% of the samples of Y-DNA belonged to the West Eurasian haplogroup R1, while the other 50% belonged to East Eurasian haplogroups Q and O. The extracted samples of mtDNA belonged mainly to East Eurasian haplogroups C4b1, A14 and A15c, while one specimen carried the West Eurasian haplogroup H2a. The authors suggested that central Asian nomadic populations may have been Turkicized by an East Asian minority elite, resulting in a small but detectable increase in East Asian ancestry. However, these authors also found that Türkic period individuals were extremely genetically diverse, with some individuals being of complete West Eurasian descent. To explain this diversity of ancestry, they propose that there were also incoming West Eurasians moving eastward on the Eurasian steppe during the Türkic period, resulting in admixture.

A 2020 study analyzed genetic data from 7 early medieval Türk skeletal remains from Turkic Khaganate burial sites in Mongolia. The authors described the Türk samples as highly diverse, carrying on average 40% West Eurasian, and 60% East Eurasian ancestry. West Eurasian ancestry in the Türks combined Sarmatian-related and BMAC ancestry, while the East Eurasian ancestry was related to Ancient Northeast Asians. The authors also observed that the Western Steppe Herder ancestry in the Türks was largely inherited from male ancestors, which also corresponds with the marked increase of paternal haplogroups such as R and J during the Türkic period in Mongolia. Admixture between East and West Eurasian ancestors of the Türkic samples was dated to 500 AD, which is 8 generations prior. Three of the Türkic-affiliated males carried the paternal haplogroups J2a and J1a, two carried haplogroup C-F3830, and one carried R1a-Z93. The analyzed maternal haplogroups were identified as D4, D2, B4, C4, H1 and U7.

A 2023 study published in the Journal of Systematics and Evolution analyzed the DNA of Empress Ashina (551–582), a royal Göktürk and immediate descendant of the first Khagans, whose remains were recovered from a mausoleum in Xianyang, China. The authors determined that Empress Ashina belonged to the North-East Asian mtDNA haplogroup F1d. Approximately 96-98% of her autosomal ancestry was of Ancient Northeast Asian origin, while roughly 2-4% was of West Eurasian origin, indicating ancient admixture, and no Chinese (&quot;Yellow River&quot;) admixture. The results are consistent with a North-East Asian origin of the royal Ashina family and the Göktürk Khaganate. However, the Ashina did not show close genetic affinity with central-steppe Türks and early medieval Türks, who exhibit a high (but variable) degree of West Eurasian ancestry, which indicates that there was genetic sub-structure within the Türkic empire. For example, the ancestry of early medieval Turks was derived from Ancient Northeast Asians for about 62% of their genome, while the remaining 38% was derived from West Eurasians (BMAC and Afanasievo), with the admixture occurring around the year 500 CE.

The Ashina was found to share genetic affinities to post-Iron Age Tungusic and Mongolic pastoralists, and was genetically closer to East Asians, while having heterogeneous relationships towards various Turkic-speaking groups in central Asia, suggesting genetic heterogeneity and multiple sources of origin for the population of the Turkic empire. This shows that the Ashina lineage had a dominating contribution on Mongolic and Tungusic speakers but limited contribution on Turkic-speaking populations. According to the authors, these findings &quot;once again validates a cultural diffusion model over a demic diffusion model for the spread of Turkic languages&quot; and refutes &quot;the western Eurasian origin and multiple origin hypotheses&quot; in favor of an East Asian origin for the royal Ashina family.

Two Türk remains (GD1-1 and GD2-4) excavated from present-day eastern Mongolia analysed in a 2024 paper, were found to display only little to no West Eurasian ancestry. One of the Türk remains (GD1-1) was derived entirely from an Ancient Northeast Asian source (represented by SlabGrave1 or Khovsgol_LBA and Xianbei_Mogushan_IA), while the other Türk remain (GD2-4) displayed an &quot;admixed profile&quot; deriving c. 48−50% ancestry from Ancient Northeast Asians, c. 47% ancestry from an ancestry maximised in Han Chinese (represented by Han_2000BP), and 3−5% ancestry from a West Eurasian source (represented by Sarmatians). The GD2-4 belonged to the paternal haplogroup D-M174. The authors argue that these findings are &quot;providing a new piece of information on this understudied period&quot;.

<doc id="12239" wikidata="Q628939" url="?curid=12239" title="Guilt (emotion)">
<text>Guilt is a moral emotion that occurs when a person believes or realizes—accurately or not—that they have compromised their own standards of conduct or have violated universal moral standards and bear significant responsibility for that violation.
Guilt is closely related to the concepts of remorse, regret, and shame.

Guilt is an important factor in perpetuating obsessive–compulsive disorder symptoms.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the word is obscure, and developed its modern spelling from the Old English form &quot;gylt&quot; &quot;crime, sin, fault, fine, debt&quot;, which is possibly derived from Old English &quot;gieldan&quot; &quot;to pay for, debt&quot;. Because it was used in the Lord&#x27;s Prayer as the translation for the Latin &quot;debitum&quot; and also in Matthew xviii. 27, and &quot;gyltiȝ&quot; is used to render &quot;debet&quot; in Matthew xxiii. 18, it has been inferred to have had the primary sense of ‘debt’, though there is no real evidence for this.

Its development into a &quot;sense of guilt&quot; is first recorded in 1690 as a misuse of its original meaning. &quot;Guilt by association&quot; is first recorded in 1941.

&quot;Guilty&quot; is similarly from Old English &quot;gyltig&quot;, itself from &quot;gylt&quot;.

== Psychology ==
Guilt and its associated causes, advantages, and disadvantages are common themes in psychology and psychiatry. Both in specialized and in ordinary language, guilt is an affective state in which one experiences conflict at having done something that one believes one should not have done (or conversely, having not done something one believes one should have done). It gives rise to a feeling which does not go away easily, driven by &#x27;conscience&#x27;. Sigmund Freud described this as the result of a struggle between the ego and the superego – parental imprinting. Freud rejected the role of God as punisher in times of illness or rewarder in time of wellness. While removing one source of guilt from patients, he described another. This was the unconscious force within the individual that contributed to illness, Freud in fact coming to consider &quot;the obstacle of an unconscious sense of guilt...as the most powerful of all obstacles to recovery.&quot; For his later explicator, Jacques Lacan, guilt was the inevitable companion of the signifying subject who acknowledged normality in the form of the Symbolic order.

Alice Miller claims that &quot;many people suffer all their lives from this oppressive feeling of guilt, the sense of not having lived up to their parents&#x27; expectations...no argument can overcome these guilt feelings, for they have their beginnings in life&#x27;s earliest period, and from that they derive their intensity.&quot; This may be linked to what Les Parrott has called &quot;the disease of false guilt...At the root of false guilt is the idea that what you &quot;feel&quot; must be true.&quot;

Therapists recognized similar feelings of guilt in individuals that survived traumatic events that involved a loved one perishing called survivor&#x27;s guilt.

The philosopher Martin Buber underlined the difference between the Freudian notion of guilt, based on internal conflicts, and &quot;existential guilt&quot;, based on actual harm done to others.

Guilt is often associated with anxiety. In mania, according to Otto Fenichel, the patient succeeds in applying to guilt &quot;the defense mechanism of denial by overcompensation...re-enacts being a person without guilt feelings.&quot;

In psychological research, guilt can be measured by using questionnaires, such as the Differential Emotions Scale (Izard&#x27;s DES), or the Dutch Guilt Measurement Instrument.

=== Defenses ===
According to psychoanalytic theory, defenses against feeling guilt can become an overriding aspect of one&#x27;s personality. The methods that can be used to avoid guilt are multiple. They include:
#Repression, usually used by the superego and ego against instinctive impulses, but on occasion employed against the superego/conscience itself. If the defence fails, then (in a return of the repressed) one may begin to feel guilty years later for actions lightly committed at the time.
#Projection is another defensive tool with wide applications. It may take the form of blaming the victim: The victim of someone else&#x27;s accident or bad luck may be offered criticism, the theory being that the victim may be at fault for having attracted the other person&#x27;s hostility. Alternatively, not the guilt, but the condemning agency itself, may be projected onto other people, in the hope that they will look upon one&#x27;s deeds more favorably than one&#x27;s own conscience (a process that verges on ideas of reference).
#Sharing a feeling of guilt, and thereby being less alone with it, is a motive force in both art and joke-telling; while it is also possible to &quot;borrow&quot; a sense of guilt from someone who is seen as in the wrong, and thereby assuage one&#x27;s own.
#Self-harm may be used as an alternative to compensating the object of one&#x27;s transgression – perhaps in the form of not allowing oneself to enjoy opportunities open to one, or benefits due, as a result of uncompensated guilt feelings.

=== Behavioral responses ===
Guilt proneness is reliably associated with moral character. Similarly, feelings of guilt can prompt subsequent virtuous behavior. People who feel guilty may be more likely to exercise restraint, avoid self-indulgence, and exhibit less prejudice. Guilt appears to prompt reparatory behaviors to alleviate the negative emotions that it engenders. People appear to engage in targeted and specific reparatory behaviors toward the persons they wronged or offended.

=== Lack of guilt in psychopaths ===
Individuals high in psychopathy lack any true sense of guilt or remorse for harm they may have caused others. Instead, they rationalize their behavior, blame someone else, or deny it outright. People with psychopathy have a tendency to be harmful to themselves and to others. They have little ability to plan ahead for the future. An individual with psychopathy will never find themselves at fault because they will do whatever it takes to benefit themselves without reservation. A person that does not feel guilt or remorse would have no reason to find themselves at fault for something that they did with the intention of hurting another person. To a person high in psychopathy, their actions can always be rationalized to be the fault of another person. This is seen by psychologists as part of a lack of moral reasoning (in comparison with the majority of humans), an inability to evaluate situations in a moral framework, and an inability to develop emotional bonds with other people due to a lack of empathy.

One study on psychopaths found that, under certain circumstances, they could willfully empathize with others, and that their empathic reaction initiated the same way it does for controls. Psychopathic criminals were brain-scanned while watching videos of a person harming another individual. The psychopaths&#x27; empathic reaction initiated the same way it did for controls when they were instructed to empathize with the harmed individual, and the area of the brain relating to pain was activated when the psychopaths were asked to imagine how the harmed individual felt. The research suggests psychopaths can switch empathy on at will, which would enable them to be both callous and charming. The team who conducted the study say they do not know how to transform this willful empathy into the spontaneous empathy most people have, though they propose it might be possible to rehabilitate psychopaths by helping them to activate their &quot;empathy switch&quot;. Others suggested that it remains unclear whether psychopaths&#x27; experience of empathy was the same as that of controls, and also questioned the possibility of devising therapeutic interventions that would make the empathic reactions more automatic.

Neuroscientist Antonio R. Damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers, and that when confronted with moral dilemmas, these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with &quot;end-justifies-the-means&quot; answers, leading Damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions, but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue – in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city – these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains. According to Adrian Raine, a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California, one of this study&#x27;s implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people: &quot;Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse. Without that awareness, people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets. Does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability?&quot;

=== Causes ===
==== Evolutionary theories ====
Some evolutionary psychologists theorize that guilt and shame helped maintain beneficial relationships, such as reciprocal altruism. If a person feels guilty when he harms another or fails to reciprocate kindness, he is more likely not to harm others or become too selfish. In this way, he reduces the chances of retaliation by members of his tribe, and thereby increases his survival prospects, and those of the tribe or group. As with any other emotion, guilt can be manipulated to control or influence others. As highly social animals living in large, relatively stable groups, humans need ways to deal with conflicts and events in which they inadvertently or purposefully harm others. If someone causes harm to another, and then feels guilt and demonstrates regret and sorrow, the person harmed is likely to forgive. Thus, guilt makes it possible to forgive, and helps hold the social group together.

== Collective guilt ==

Collective guilt (or group guilt) is the unpleasant and often emotional reaction that results among a group of individuals when it is perceived that the group illegitimately harmed members of another group. It is often the result of &quot;sharing a social identity with others whose actions represent a threat to the positivity of that identity&quot;. For an individual to experience collective guilt, he must identify himself as a part of the in-group. &quot;This produces a perceptual shift from thinking of oneself in terms of &#x27;I&#x27; and &#x27;me&#x27; to &#x27;us&#x27; or &#x27;we&#x27;.”

== Comparison with shame ==
Guilt and shame are two closely related concepts, but they have key differences that should not be overlooked. Cultural Anthropologist Ruth Benedict describes shame as the result of a violation of cultural or social values, while guilt is conjured up internally when one&#x27;s personal morals are violated. To put it more simply, the primary difference between shame and guilt is the source that creates the emotion. Shame arises from a real or imagined negative perception coming from others and guilt arises from a negative perception of one&#x27;s own thoughts or actions.

Psychoanalyst Helen Block Lewis stated that, &quot;The experience of shame is directly about the self, which is the focus of evaluation. In guilt, the self is not the central object of negative evaluation, but rather the thing done is the focus.&quot; An individual can still possess a positive perception of themselves while also feeling guilt for certain actions or thoughts they took part in. Contrary to guilt, Shame has a more inclusive focus on the individual as a whole. Fossum and Mason&#x27;s ideas clearly outline this idea in their book Facing Shame. They state that &quot;While guilt is a painful feeling of regret and responsibility for one&#x27;s actions, shame is a painful feeling about oneself as a person&quot;.

Shame can almost be described as looking at yourself unfavorably through the eyes of others. Psychiatrist Judith Lewis Herman portrays this idea by stating that &quot;Shame is an acutely self-conscious state in which the self is &#x27;split,&#x27; imagining the self in the eyes of the other; by contrast, in guilt the self is unified&quot;. Both shame and guilt are directly related to self-perception, only shame causes the individual to account for the cultural and social beliefs of others. 

Paul Gilbert talks about the powerful hold that shame can take over someone in his article Evolution, Social Roles, and the Differences in Shame and Guilt. He says that &quot;The fear of shame and ridicule can be so strong that people will risk serious physical injury or even death to avoid it. One of the reasons for this is because shame can indicate serious damage to social acceptance and a breakdown in a variety of social relationships. The evolutionary root of shame is in a self-focused, social threat system related to competitive behavior and the need to prove oneself acceptable/desirable to others&quot; Guilt on the other hand evolved from a place of Care-Giving and avoidance of any act that harms others.

== Cultural views ==

Traditional Japanese society, Korean society and Chinese culture are sometimes said to be &quot;shame-based&quot; rather than &quot;guilt-based&quot;, in that the social consequences of &quot;getting caught&quot; are seen as more important than the individual feelings or experiences of the agent (see the work of Ruth Benedict). The same has been said of Ancient Greek society, a culture where, in Bruno Snell&#x27;s words, if &quot;honour is destroyed the moral existence of the loser collapses.&quot;

This may lead to more of a focus on etiquette than on ethics as understood in Western civilization, leading some in Western civilizations to question why the word &quot;ethos&quot; was adapted from Ancient Greek with such vast differences in cultural norms. Christianity and Islam inherit most notions of guilt from Judaism, Persian, and Roman ideas, mostly as interpreted through Augustine, who adapted Plato&#x27;s ideas to Christianity. The Latin word for guilt is &quot;culpa&quot;, a word sometimes seen in law literature, for instance in &quot;mea culpa&quot; meaning &quot;my fault (guilt)&quot;.

=== In literature ===
Guilt is a main theme in John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;East of Eden&quot;, Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Macbeth&quot;, Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; and &quot;The Black Cat&quot;, and many other works of literature. In Sartre&#x27;s &quot;The Flies&quot;, the Furies (in the form of flies) represent the morbid, strangling forces of neurotic guilt which bind us to authoritarian and totalitarian power.

Guilt is a major theme in many works by Nathaniel Hawthorne, and is an almost universal concern of novelists who explore inner life and secrets.

=== In Epicurean Philosophy ===
In his Kyriai Doxai (Principal Doctrines) 17 and 35, Epicurus teaches that we may identify and diagnose guilt by its signs and perturbations. Within his ethical system based on pleasure and pain, guilt manifests as constant fear of detection that emerges from &quot;secretly doing something contrary to an agreement to not harm one another or be harmed&quot;.

Since Epicurus rejects supernatural claims, the easiest way to avoid this perturbation is to avoid the antisocial behavior in order to continue enjoying ataraxia (the state of no-perturbation). However, once guilt is unavoidable, Epicurean Guides recommended confession of one&#x27;s offenses as a practice that helps to purge the character from its evil tendencies and reform the character. According to Norman DeWitt, author of &quot;St Paul and Epicurus&quot;, confession was one of the Epicurean practices that was later appropriated by the early Christian communities.

=== In the Christian Bible ===
Guilt in the Christian Bible is not merely an emotional state; it is also a legal state of deserving punishment. The Hebrew Bible does not have a unique word for guilt, but uses a single word to signify: &quot;sin, the guilt of it, the punishment due unto it, and a sacrifice for it.&quot; The Greek New Testament uses a word for guilt that means &quot;standing exposed to judgment for sin&quot; (e. g., Romans 3:19). In what Christians call the &quot;Old Testament&quot;, Christians believe the Bible teaches that, through sacrifice, one&#x27;s sins can be forgiven (Judaism categorically rejects this idea, holding that forgiveness of sin is exclusively through repentance, and the role of sacrifices was for atonement of sins committed by accident or ignorance ).

The New Testament says that forgiveness is given as written in 1 Corinthians 15:3–4: &quot;3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, for that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.&quot; In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, salvation is granted based on God&#x27;s grace and forgiveness (Gen 6:8; 19:19; Exo 33:12–17; 34:6–7).

The New Testament says that, in Jesus Christ, God took upon Himself the sins of the world and died on the cross to pay mankind&#x27;s debt (Rom 6:23). Those who repent and accept Christ&#x27;s sacrifice for their sins, will be redeemed by God and thus not guilty before Him. They will be granted eternal life which will take effect after the Second Coming of Christ (1 Thess 4:13–18).

The Bible agrees with pagan cultures that guilt creates a cost that someone must pay (Heb 9:22). (This assumption was expressed in the previous section, &quot;Defences&quot;: &quot;Guilty people punish themselves if they have no opportunity to compensate the transgression that caused them to feel guilty. It was found that self-punishment did not occur if people had an opportunity to compensate the victim of their transgression.&quot;) Unlike pagan deities who demanded that debts for sin be paid by humans, God, according to the Bible, loved humanity enough to pay it Himself (Mat 5:45).
