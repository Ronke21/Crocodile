<text>The Great Plague of London, lasting from 1665 to 1666, was the most recent major epidemic of the bubonic plague to occur in England. It happened within the centuries-long Second Pandemic, a period of intermittent bubonic plague epidemics that originated in Central Asia in 1331 (the first year of the Black Death), and included related diseases such as pneumonic plague and septicemic plague, which lasted until 1750.

The Great Plague killed an estimated 100,000 people—almost a quarter of London&#x27;s population—in 18 months. The plague was caused by the &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; bacterium, which is usually transmitted to a human by the bite of a flea or louse.

The 1665–66 epidemic was on a much smaller scale than the earlier Black Death pandemic. It became known afterwards as the &quot;great&quot; plague mainly because it was the last widespread outbreak of bubonic plague in England during the 400-year Second Pandemic.

==London in 1665==
The plague was endemic in 17th-century London, as it was in other European cities at the time. The disease periodically erupted into massive epidemics. There were 30,000 deaths due to the plague in 1603, 35,000 in 1625, 10,000 in 1636, and smaller numbers in other years.

In late 1664, a bright comet was seen in the sky, and the people of London became fearful, wondering what evil event it portended. London at that time was a city of about 448 acres surrounded by a city wall that had originally been built to keep out raiding bands, and, in the south, by the River Thames. There were gates in the wall at Ludgate, Newgate, Aldersgate, Cripplegate, Moorgate, Bishopsgate and Aldgate, and the Thames was crossable at London Bridge. In the poorer parts of the city, filled with overcrowded tenements and garrets, hygiene was impossible to maintain. There was no sanitation, and open drains flowed along the centre of winding streets. The cobbles were slippery with animal droppings, rubbish and the slops thrown out of the houses; they were muddy and buzzing with flies in summer, and awash with sewage in winter. The City Corporation employed &quot;rakers&quot; to remove the worst of the filth, and it was transported to mounds outside the walls, where it accumulated and continued to decompose. The stench was overwhelming, and people walked around with handkerchiefs or nosegays pressed against their nostrils.

Some of the city&#x27;s necessities, such as coal, arrived by barge, but most came by road. Carts, carriages, horses and pedestrians were crowded together, and the gateways in the wall formed bottlenecks through which it was difficult to progress. The nineteen-arch London Bridge was even more congested. Those who were better-off used hackney carriages and sedan chairs to get to their destinations without getting filthy. The poor walked, and might be drenched by water tossed up by wheeled vehicles, slops thrown into the street, or water pouring off overhanging roofs. Another hazard was the choking black smoke belching forth from soap factories, breweries, iron smelters and about 15,000 households that were burning coal to heat their homes.

Outside the city walls, shanty towns with wooden shacks and no sanitation had sprung up, providing homes for the craftsmen and tradespeople who had flocked to the already overcrowded city. The government had tried to limit the development of these &quot;suburbs&quot;, but had failed: Over a quarter of a million people lived in them. When Royalists had fled the country during the Commonwealth, they had left many fine town houses vacant, and some immigrants to London had crowded into them, converting them into tenements that housed different families in every room. These properties were soon vandalised and became rat-infested.

The City of London proper was administered by the Lord Mayor, the Aldermen and the common councillors, but some parts of the greater metropolitan area were not legally part of the city. Some of these areas, both inside the City walls and outside its boundaries, had long been organised into districts of various sizes, called &quot;liberties&quot;, that had historically been granted rights to self-government. (Many had originally been associated with the religious institutions that were abolished in the Dissolution of the Monasteries, whereupon their historic rights and property had been transferred to secular owners.)

By 1665, the walled City was surrounded by a ring of liberties which had come under its authority, and these had come to be referred to collectively as &#x27;the City and Liberties&#x27;. However, this area was surrounded by additional suburbs with other independent administrations. For example, Westminster was an independent town with its own liberties, joined to London by urban development, and the Tower of London was an independent liberty. Areas that were not part of any of these various independent administrations came under the authority of the county of Middlesex if they were north of the river, and under the authority of Surrey if they were south of the river.

At that time, bubonic plague was a much feared disease, but its cause was not understood. Many mistakenly blamed emanations from the earth, &quot;pestilential effluvia&quot;, unusual weather, sickness in livestock, abnormal behaviour of animals or an increase in the numbers of moles, frogs, mice or flies. It was not until 1894 that its causal agent, the bacterium &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;, was identified by Alexandre Yersin, and its transmission by rat fleas became known. Although the Great Plague in London was long assumed to be bubonic plague, caused by &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;, this was only confirmed (by DNA analysis) in 2016. It is now believed that human body lice also played a key role in causing infections, perhaps more so than rats.

==The recording of deaths==

In order to judge the severity of an epidemic, it is first necessary to know how big the population was in which it occurred. There was no official census of the population to provide this figure, and the best contemporary count comes from the work of John Graunt (1620–1674), who was one of the earliest Fellows of the Royal Society and one of the first demographers, bringing a scientific approach to the collection of statistics. In 1662, he estimated that 384,000 people lived in the City of London, the Liberties, Westminster and the out-parishes, based on figures in the Bills of Mortality published each week in the capital. These different districts with different administrations constituted the officially recognized extent of London as a whole. In 1665, he revised his estimate to &quot;not above 460,000&quot;. Other contemporaries put the figure higher (the French Ambassador, for example, suggested 600,000), but with no mathematical basis to support their estimates. The next largest city in the kingdom was Norwich, with a population of 30,000.

There was no duty to report a death to anyone in authority. Instead, each parish appointed two or more &quot;searchers of the dead&quot;, whose duty was to inspect a corpse and determine the cause of death. A searcher was entitled to charge a small fee from relatives for each death they reported, and so habitually the parish would appoint someone to the post who would otherwise be destitute and would be receiving support from the parish poor rate. Typically, this meant searchers would be old women who were illiterate, might know little about identifying diseases and who would be open to dishonesty. Searchers would typically learn about a death either from the local sexton who had been asked to dig a grave or from the tolling of a church bell. Anyone who did not report a death to their local church, such as Quakers, Anabaptists, other non-Anglican Christians or Jews, frequently did not get included in the official records. Searchers during times of plague were required to live apart from the community, avoid other people and carry a white stick to warn of their occupation when outdoors, and stay indoors except when performing their duties, to avoid spreading the diseases. Searchers reported to the Parish Clerk, who made a return each week to the Company of Parish Clerks in Brode Lane. Figures were then passed to the Lord Mayor and then to the Minister of State once plague became a matter of national concern. The reported figures were used to compile the Bills of Mortality, which listed total deaths in each parish and whether by the plague. The system of Searchers to report the cause of death continued until 1836.

Graunt recorded the incompetence of the Searchers at identifying true causes of death, remarking on the frequent recording of &#x27;consumption&#x27; rather than other diseases which were recognized then by physicians. He suggested a cup of ale and a doubling of their fee to two groats rather than one was sufficient for Searchers to change the cause of death to one more convenient for the householders. No one wished to be known as having had a death by plague in their household, and Parish Clerks, too, connived in covering up cases of plague in their official returns. Analysis of the Bills of Mortality during the months plague took hold shows a rise in deaths other than by plague well above the average death rate, a tell-tale sign of misrepresentation of the true cause of death. As plague spread, a system of quarantine was introduced, whereby any house where someone had died from plague would be locked up and no one allowed to enter or leave for 40 days. This frequently led to the deaths of the other inhabitants, by neglect if not from the plague, and provided ample incentive not to report the disease. The official returns record 68,596 cases of plague, but a reasonable estimate suggests this figure is 30,000 short of the true total. A plague house was marked with a red cross on the door with the words &quot;Lord have mercy upon us&quot;, and a watchman stood guard outside.

==Preventive measures==
Reports of plague around Europe began to reach England in the 1660s, causing the Privy Council to consider what steps might be taken to prevent it crossing to England. Quarantining (isolation) of ships had been used during previous outbreaks and was again introduced for ships coming to London in November 1663, following outbreaks in Amsterdam and Hamburg. Two naval ships were assigned to intercept any vessels entering the Thames estuary. Ships from infected ports were required to moor at Hole Haven on Canvey Island for a &quot;trentine&quot; – period of 30 days – before being allowed to travel up-river. Ships from ports free of plague or completing their isolation period were given a certificate of health and allowed to travel on. A second inspection line was established between the forts on opposite banks of the Thames at Tilbury and Gravesend with instructions to pass only ships with a certificate.

The isolation period was increased to forty days – a &quot;quarantine&quot; – in May 1664 as the continental plague worsened, and the areas subject to quarantine changed with the news of the spread of plague to include all of Holland, Zeeland and Friesland (all regions of the Dutch Republic); restrictions on Hamburg were removed in November. Quarantine measures against ships coming from the Dutch Republic were put in place in 29 other ports from May, starting with Great Yarmouth. The Dutch ambassador objected at the constraint of trade with his country, but England responded that it had been one of the last countries introducing such restrictions. Regulations were enforced quite strictly, so that people or houses where voyagers had come ashore without serving their quarantine were also subjected to 40 days of quarantine.

==Outbreak==

Plague was one of the hazards of life in Britain from its dramatic appearance in 1348 with the Black Death. The Bills of Mortality began to be published regularly in 1603, in which year 33,347 deaths were recorded from plague. Between then and 1665, only four years had no recorded cases. In 1563, a thousand people were reportedly dying in London each week. In 1593, there were 15,003 deaths, 1625 saw 41,313 dead, between 1640 and 1646 came 11,000 deaths, culminating in 3,597 for 1647. The 1625 outbreak was recorded at the time as the &#x27;Great Plague&#x27;, until deaths from the plague of 1665 surpassed it. These official figures are likely to under-report actual numbers.

===Early days===

Plague was sufficiently uncommon that medical practitioners might have had no personal experience of seeing the disease; medical training varied from those who had attended the college of physicians, to apothecaries who also acted as doctors, to charlatans. Other diseases abounded, such as an outbreak of smallpox the year before, and these uncertainties all added to difficulties identifying the true start of the epidemic. Contemporary accounts suggest cases of plague occurred through the winter of 1664–65, some of which were fatal but a number of which did not display the virulence of the later epidemic. The winter was cold, the ground frozen from December to March, river traffic on the Thames twice blocked by ice, and it may be that the cold weather held back its spread.

This outbreak of bubonic plague in England is thought to have spread from the Netherlands, where the disease had been occurring intermittently since 1599. It is unclear exactly where the disease first struck but the initial contagion may have arrived with Dutch trading ships carrying bales of cotton from Amsterdam, which was ravaged by the disease in 1663–64, with a mortality given of 50,000. The first areas to be struck are believed to be the dock areas just outside London, and the parish of St Giles. In both of these localities, poor workers were crowded into ill-kept structures. Two suspicious deaths were recorded in St Giles parish in 1664 and another in February 1665. These did not appear as plague deaths on the Bills of Mortality, so no control measures were taken by the authorities, but the total number of people dying in London during the first four months of 1665 showed a marked increase. By the end of April, only four plague deaths had been recorded, two in the parish of St. Giles, but total deaths per week had risen from around 290 to 398.

There had been three official cases in April, a level of plague which in earlier years had not induced any official response, but the Privy Council now acted to introduce household quarantine. Justices of the Peace in Middlesex were instructed to investigate any suspected cases and to shut up the house if it was confirmed. Shortly after, a similar order was issued by the King&#x27;s Bench to the City and Liberties. A riot broke out in St. Giles when the first house was sealed up; the crowd broke down the door and released the inhabitants. Rioters caught were punished severely. Instructions were given to build pest-houses, which were essentially isolation hospitals built away from other people where the sick could be cared for (or stay until they died). This official activity suggests that despite the few recorded cases, the government was already aware that this was a serious outbreak of plague.

With the arrival of warmer weather, the disease began to take a firmer hold. In the week 2–9 May, there were three recorded deaths in the parish of St Giles, four in neighbouring St Clement Danes and one each in St Andrew Holborn and St Mary Woolchurch Haw. Only the last was actually inside the city walls. A Privy Council committee was formed to investigate methods to best prevent the spread of plague, and measures were introduced to close some of the ale houses in affected areas and limit the number of lodgers allowed in a household. In the city, the Lord Mayor issued a proclamation that all householders must diligently clean the streets outside their property, which was a householder&#x27;s responsibility, not a state one (the city employed scavengers and rakers to remove the worst of the mess). Matters just became worse, and Aldermen were instructed to find and punish those failing their duty. As cases in St. Giles began to rise, an attempt was made to quarantine the area and constables were instructed to inspect everyone wishing to travel and contain inside vagrants or suspect persons.

People began to be alarmed. Samuel Pepys, who had an important position at the Admiralty, stayed in London and provided a contemporary account of the plague through his diary. On 30 April he wrote: &quot;Great fears of the sickness here in the City it being said that two or three houses are already shut up. God preserve us all!&quot; Another source of information on the time is &quot;A Journal of the Plague Year&quot;, which was written by Daniel Defoe and published in 1722. He had been only five when the plague struck but made use of his family&#x27;s recollections (his uncle was a saddler in East London and his father a butcher in Cripplegate), interviews with survivors and sight of such official records as were available.

The onset of the disease was recalled two years later by Puritan minister Thomas Vincent:

===Exodus from the city===

By July 1665, plague was rampant in the City of London. The rich ran away, including King Charles II of England, his family and his court, who left the city for Salisbury, moving on to Oxford in September when some cases of plague occurred in Salisbury. The aldermen and most of the other city authorities opted to stay at their posts. The Lord Mayor of London, Sir John Lawrence, also decided to stay in the city. Businesses were closed when merchants and professionals fled. Defoe wrote &quot;Nothing was to be seen but wagons and carts, with goods, women, servants, children, coaches filled with people of the better sort, and horsemen attending them, and all hurrying away&quot;. As the plague raged throughout the summer, only a small number of clergymen, physicians and apothecaries remained to cope with an increasingly large number of victims. Ellen Cotes, author of &quot;London&#x27;s Dreadful Visitation&quot;, expressed the hope that &quot;Neither the Physicians of our Souls or Bodies may hereafter in such great numbers forsake us&quot;.

The poorer people were also alarmed by the contagion and some left the city, but it was not easy for them to abandon their accommodation and livelihoods for an uncertain future elsewhere. Before exiting through the city gates, they were required to possess a certificate of good health signed by the Lord Mayor and these became increasingly difficult to obtain. As time went by and the numbers of plague victims rose, people living in the villages outside London began to resent this exodus and were no longer prepared to accept townsfolk from London, with or without a certificate. The refugees were turned back, were not allowed to pass through towns and had to travel across country, and were forced to live rough on what they could steal or scavenge from the fields. Many died in wretched circumstances of starvation and dehydration in the hot summer that was to follow.

===Height of the epidemic===

In the last week of July, the London Bill of Mortality showed 3,014 deaths, of which 2,020 had died from the plague. The number of deaths as a result of plague may have been underestimated, as deaths in other years in the same period were much lower, at around 300. As the number of victims affected mounted up, burial grounds became overfull, and pits were dug to accommodate the dead. Drivers of dead-carts travelled the streets calling &quot;Bring out your dead&quot; and carted away piles of bodies. The authorities became concerned that the number of deaths might cause public alarm and ordered that body removal and interment should take place only at night. As time went on, there were too many victims, and too few drivers, to remove the bodies which began to be stacked up against the walls of houses. Daytime collection was resumed and the plague pits became mounds of decomposing corpses. In the parish of Aldgate, a great hole was dug near the churchyard, fifty feet long and twenty feet wide. Digging was continued by labourers at one end while the dead-carts tipped in corpses at the other. When there was no room for further extension it was dug deeper until ground water was reached at twenty feet. When finally covered with earth it housed 1,114 corpses.

Plague doctors traversed the streets diagnosing victims, many of them without formal medical training. Several public health efforts were attempted. Physicians were hired by city officials and burial details were carefully organized, but panic spread through the city and, out of the fear of contagion, bodies were hastily buried in overcrowded pits. The means of transmission of the disease were not known but thinking they might be linked to the animals, the City Corporation ordered a cull of dogs and cats. This decision may have extended the length of the epidemic since those animals could have helped keep in check the rat population carrying the fleas which transmitted the disease. Thinking bad air was involved in transmission, the authorities ordered giant bonfires to be burned in the streets and house fires to be kept burning night and day, in the hope that the air would be cleansed. Tobacco was thought to be a prophylactic and it was later said that no London tobacconist had died from the plague during the epidemic.

Trade and business had dried up, and the streets were empty of people except for the dead-carts and the dying victims, as witnessed and recorded by Samuel Pepys in his diary: &quot;Lord! How empty the streets are and how melancholy, so many poor sick people in the streets full of sores… in Westminster, there is never a physician and but one apothecary left, all being dead.&quot; That people did not starve was down to the foresight of Sir John Lawrence and the Corporation of London who arranged for a commission of one farthing to be paid above the normal price for every quarter of corn landed in the Port of London. Another food source was the villages around London which, denied of their usual sales in the capital, left vegetables in specified market areas, negotiated their sale by shouting, and collected their payment after the money had been left submerged in a bucket of vinegar to &quot;disinfect&quot; the coins.

Records state that plague deaths in London and the suburbs crept up over the summer from 2,000 people per week to over 7,000 per week in September. These figures are likely to be a considerable underestimate. Many of the sextons and parish clerks who kept the records themselves died. Quakers refused to co-operate and many of the poor were just dumped into mass graves unrecorded. It is not clear how many people caught the disease and made a recovery because only deaths were recorded and many records were destroyed in the Great Fire of London the following year. In the few districts where intact records remain, plague deaths varied between 30% and over 50% of the total population.

Vincent wrote:

The outbreak was concentrated in London, but it affected other areas as well. Perhaps the best known example occurred in the village of Eyam in Derbyshire. The plague allegedly arrived with a merchant carrying a parcel of cloth sent from London. The villagers imposed a quarantine on themselves to stop the further spread of the disease. This prevented the disease from moving into surrounding areas, but around 33% of the village&#x27;s inhabitants died over a period of fourteen months. Other places hit hard included Derby and Norwich. In Bristol strenuous efforts by the City Council seems to have limited the death rate to c.0.6 per cent during an outbreak lasting from April to September 1666.

==Aftermath==
By late autumn, the death toll in London and the suburbs began to slow until, in February 1666, it was considered safe enough for the King and his entourage to come back to the city. With the return of the monarch, others began to return: The gentry returned in their carriages accompanied by carts piled high with their belongings. The judges moved back from Windsor to sit in Westminster Hall; Parliament, which had been prorogued in April 1665, did not reconvene until September 1666. Trade recommenced and businesses and workshops opened up. London was the goal of a new wave of people who flocked to the city in expectation of making their fortunes. Writing at the end of March 1666, Lord Clarendon, the Lord Chancellor, stated &quot;... the streets were as full, the Exchange as much crowded, the people in all places as numerous as they had ever been seen ...&quot;.

Plague cases continued to occur sporadically at a modest rate until mid-1666. That September, the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the City of London, and some people believed that the fire put an end to the epidemic. It is now thought that the plague had largely subsided before the fire took place. Most of the later cases of plague were found in the suburbs, and it was the City of London that was destroyed by the fire.

According to the Bills of Mortality, there were in total 68,596 deaths in London from the plague in 1665. Lord Clarendon estimated that the true number of mortalities was probably twice that figure. 1666 saw further deaths in other cities but on a lesser scale. Dr Thomas Gumble, chaplain to the Duke of Albemarle, both of whom had stayed in London for the whole of the epidemic, estimated that the total death count for the country from plague during 1665 and 1666 was about 200,000. Among the more notable death victims were Samuel Fisher, John Godwin, John Lewger and George Starkey.

The Great Plague of 1665/1666 was the most recent major outbreak of bubonic plague in Great Britain. The last recorded death from plague came in 1679, and it was removed as a specific category in the Bills of Mortality after 1703. It spread to other towns in East Anglia and the southeast of England but fewer than ten per cent of parishes outside London had a higher than average death rate during those years. Urban areas were more affected than rural ones; Norwich, Ipswich, Colchester, Southampton and Winchester were badly affected, while the west of England and areas of the English Midlands escaped altogether.

The population of England in 1650 was approximately 5.25 million, which declined to about 4.9 million by 1680, recovering to just over 5 million by 1700. Other diseases, such as smallpox, took a high toll on the population without the contribution by plague. The higher death rate in cities, both generally and specifically from the plague, was made up by continuous immigration, from small towns to larger ones and from the countryside to the towns.

There were no contemporary censuses of London&#x27;s population, but available records suggest that the population returned to its previous level within a couple of years. Burials in 1667 had returned to 1663 levels, Hearth Tax returns had recovered, and John Graunt contemporarily analysed baptism records and concluded they represented a recovered population. Part of this could be accounted for by the return of wealthy households, merchants and manufacturing industries, all of which needed to replace losses among their staff and took steps to bring in necessary people. Colchester had suffered more severe depopulation, but manufacturing records for cloth suggested that production had recovered or even increased by 1669, and the total population had nearly returned to pre-plague levels by 1674. Other towns did less well: Ipswich was affected less than Colchester, but in 1674, its population had dropped by 18%, more than could be accounted for by the plague deaths alone.

As a proportion of the population who died, the London death toll was less severe than in some other towns. The total of deaths in London was greater than in any previous outbreak for 100 years, though as a proportion of the population, the epidemics in 1563, 1603 and 1625 were comparable or greater. Perhaps around 2.5% of the English population died.

==Impact==

The plague in London largely affected the poor, as the rich were able to leave the city by either retiring to their country estates or residing with kin in other parts of the country. The subsequent Great Fire of London ruined many city merchants and property owners. As a result of these events, London was largely rebuilt and Parliament enacted the Rebuilding of London Act 1666. The street plan of the capital remained relatively unchanged, but some improvements were made: streets were widened, pavements were created, open sewers abolished, wooden buildings and overhanging gables forbidden, and the design and construction of buildings controlled. The use of brick or stone was mandatory and many gracious buildings were constructed. Not only was the capital rejuvenated, but it became a healthier environment in which to live. Londoners had a greater sense of community after they had overcome the great adversities of 1665 and 1666.

Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by Robert Hooke as Surveyor of London. The architect Sir Christopher Wren was involved in the rebuilding of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and more than fifty London churches. King Charles II did much to foster the rebuilding work. He was a patron of the arts and sciences and founded the Royal Observatory and supported the Royal Society, a scientific group whose early members included Robert Hooke, Robert Boyle and Sir Isaac Newton. In fact, out of the fire and pestilence flowed a renaissance in the arts and sciences in England.

Plague pits have been archaeologically excavated during underground construction work. Between 2011 and 2015, 3,500 burials from the &#x27;New Churchyard&#x27; or &#x27;Bethlam burial ground&#x27; were discovered during the construction of the Crossrail railway at Liverpool Street. &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; DNA was found in the teeth of individuals found buried in pits at the site, confirming they had died of bubonic plague.

<text>A graphical user interface, or GUI, is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation. In many applications, GUIs are used instead of text-based UIs, which are based on typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces (CLIs), which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard.

The actions in a GUI are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements. Beyond computers, GUIs are used in many handheld mobile devices such as MP3 players, portable media players, gaming devices, smartphones and smaller household, office and industrial controls. The term &quot;GUI&quot; tends not to be applied to other lower-display resolution types of interfaces, such as video games (where head-up displays (&quot;HUDs&quot;) are preferred), or not including flat screens like volumetric displays because the term is restricted to the scope of 2D display screens able to describe generic information, in the tradition of the computer science research at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.

== GUI and interaction design ==
Designing the visual composition and temporal behavior of a GUI is an important part of software application programming in the area of human–computer interaction. Its goal is to enhance the efficiency and ease of use for the underlying logical design of a stored program, a design discipline named &quot;usability&quot;. Methods of user-centered design are used to ensure that the visual language introduced in the design is well-tailored to the tasks.

The visible graphical interface features of an application are sometimes referred to as &quot;chrome&quot; or &quot;GUI&quot;. Typically, users interact with information by manipulating visual widgets that allow for interactions appropriate to the kind of data they hold. The widgets of a well-designed interface are selected to support the actions necessary to achieve the goals of users. A model–view–controller allows flexible structures in which the interface is independent of and indirectly linked to application functions, so the GUI can be customized easily. This allows users to select or design a different &quot;skin&quot; or &quot;theme&quot; at will, and eases the designer&#x27;s work to change the interface as user needs evolve. Good GUI design relates to users more, and to system architecture less.
Large widgets, such as windows, usually provide a frame or container for the main presentation content such as a web page, email message, or drawing. Smaller ones usually act as a user-input tool.

A GUI may be designed for the requirements of a vertical market as application-specific GUIs. Examples include automated teller machines (ATM), point of sale (POS) touchscreens at restaurants, self-service checkouts used in a retail store, airline self-ticket and check-in, information kiosks in a public space, like a train station or a museum, and monitors or control screens in an embedded industrial application which employ a real-time operating system (RTOS).

Cell phones and handheld game systems also employ application specific touchscreen GUIs. Newer automobiles use GUIs in their navigation systems and multimedia centers, or navigation multimedia center combinations.

== Examples ==
== Components ==

A GUI uses a combination of technologies and devices to provide a platform that users can interact with, for the tasks of gathering and producing information.

A series of elements conforming a visual language have evolved to represent information stored in computers. This makes it easier for people with few computer skills to work with and use computer software. The most common combination of such elements in GUIs is the &quot;windows, icons, text fields, canvases, menus, pointer&quot; (WIMP) paradigm, especially in personal computers.

The WIMP style of interaction uses a virtual input device to represent the position of a pointing device&#x27;s interface, most often a mouse, and presents information organized in windows and represented with icons. Available commands are compiled together in menus, and actions are performed making gestures with the pointing device. A window manager facilitates the interactions between windows, applications, and the windowing system. The windowing system handles hardware devices such as pointing devices, graphics hardware, and positioning of the pointer.

In personal computers, all these elements are modeled through a desktop metaphor to produce a simulation called a desktop environment in which the display represents a desktop, on which documents and folders of documents can be placed. Window managers and other software combine to simulate the desktop environment with varying degrees of realism.

Entries may appear in a list to make space for text and details, or in a grid for compactness and larger icons with little space underneath for text. Variations in between exist, such as a list with multiple columns of items and a grid of items with rows of text extending sideways from the icon.

Multi-row and multi-column layouts commonly found on the web are &quot;shelf&quot; and &quot;waterfall&quot;. The former is found on image search engines, where images appear with a fixed height but variable length, and is typically implemented with the CSS property and parameter codice_1. A waterfall layout found on Imgur and TweetDeck with fixed width but variable height per item is usually implemented by specifying codice_2.

== Post-WIMP interface ==

Smaller app mobile devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and smartphones typically use the WIMP elements with different unifying metaphors, due to constraints in space and available input devices. Applications for which WIMP is not well suited may use newer interaction techniques, collectively termed &quot;post-WIMP&quot; UIs.

As of 2011, some touchscreen-based operating systems such as Apple&#x27;s iOS (iPhone) and Android use the class of GUIs named post-WIMP. These support styles of interaction using more than one finger in contact with a display, which allows actions such as pinching and rotating, which are unsupported by one pointer and mouse.

== Interaction ==
Human interface devices, for the efficient interaction with a GUI include a computer keyboard, especially used together with keyboard shortcuts, pointing devices for the cursor (or rather pointer) control: mouse, pointing stick, touchpad, trackball, joystick, virtual keyboards, and head-up displays (translucent information devices at the eye level).

There are also actions performed by programs that affect the GUI. For example, there are components like inotify or D-Bus to facilitate communication between computer programs.

== History ==
=== Early efforts ===
Ivan Sutherland developed Sketchpad in 1963, widely held as the first graphical computer-aided design program. It used a light pen to create and manipulate objects in engineering drawings in realtime with coordinated graphics. In the late 1960s, researchers at the Stanford Research Institute, led by Douglas Engelbart, developed the On-Line System (NLS), which used text-based hyperlinks manipulated with a then-new device: the mouse. (A 1968 demonstration of NLS became known as &quot;The Mother of All Demos&quot;.) In the 1970s, Engelbart&#x27;s ideas were further refined and extended to graphics by researchers at Xerox PARC and specifically Alan Kay, who went beyond text-based hyperlinks and used a GUI as the main interface for the Smalltalk programming language, which ran on the Xerox Alto computer, released in 1973. Most modern general-purpose GUIs are derived from this system.

The Xerox PARC GUI consisted of graphical elements such as windows, menus, radio buttons, and check boxes. The concept of icons was later introduced by David Canfield Smith, who had written a thesis on the subject under the guidance of Kay. The PARC GUI employs a pointing device along with a keyboard. These aspects can be emphasized by using the alternative term and acronym for &quot;windows, icons, menus, pointing device&quot; (WIMP). This effort culminated in the 1973 Xerox Alto, the first computer with a GUI, though the system never reached commercial production.

The first commercially available computer with a GUI was the 1979 PERQ workstation, manufactured by Three Rivers Computer Corporation. Its design was heavily influenced by the work at Xerox PARC. In 1981, Xerox eventually commercialized the ideas from the Alto in the form of a new and enhanced system – the Xerox 8010 Information System – more commonly known as the Xerox Star. These early systems spurred many other GUI efforts, including Lisp machines by Symbolics and other manufacturers, the Apple Lisa (which presented the concept of menu bar and window controls) in 1983, the Apple Macintosh 128K in 1984, and the Atari ST with Digital Research&#x27;s GEM, and Commodore Amiga in 1985. Visi On was released in 1983 for the IBM PC compatible computers, but was never popular due to its high hardware demands. Nevertheless, it was a crucial influence on the contemporary development of Microsoft Windows.

Apple, Digital Research, IBM and Microsoft used many of Xerox&#x27;s ideas to develop products, and IBM&#x27;s Common User Access specifications formed the basis of the GUIs used in Microsoft Windows, IBM OS/2 Presentation Manager, and the Unix Motif toolkit and window manager. These ideas evolved to create the interface found in current versions of Microsoft Windows, and in various desktop environments for Unix-like operating systems, such as macOS and Linux. Thus most current GUIs have largely common idioms.
=== Popularization ===

GUIs were a hot topic in the early 1980s. The Apple Lisa was released in 1983, and various windowing systems existed for DOS operating systems (including PC GEM and PC/GEOS). Individual applications for many platforms presented their own GUI variants. Despite the GUI&#x27;s advantages, many reviewers questioned the value of the entire concept, citing hardware limits and problems in finding compatible software.

In 1984, Apple released a television commercial which introduced the Apple Macintosh during the telecast of Super Bowl XVIII by CBS, with allusions to George Orwell&#x27;s noted novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. The goal of the commercial was to make people think about computers, identifying the user-friendly interface as a personal computer which departed from prior business-oriented systems, and becoming a signature representation of Apple products.

In 1985, Commodore released the Amiga 1000, along with Workbench and Kickstart 1.0 (which contained Intuition). This interface ran as a separate task, meaning it was very responsive and, unlike other GUIs of the time, it didn&#x27;t freeze up when a program was busy. Additionally, it was the first GUI to introduce something resembling Virtual Desktops.

Windows 95, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign, was a major success in the marketplace at launch and shortly became the most popular desktop operating system.

In 2007, with the iPhone and later in 2010 with the introduction of the iPad, Apple popularized the post-WIMP style of interaction for multi-touch screens, and those devices were considered to be milestones in the development of mobile devices.

The GUIs familiar to most people as of the mid-late 2010s are Microsoft Windows, macOS, and the X Window System interfaces for desktop and laptop computers, and Android, Apple&#x27;s iOS, Symbian, BlackBerry OS, Windows Phone/Windows 10 Mobile, Tizen, WebOS, and Firefox OS for handheld (smartphone) devices.

Since the commands available in command line interfaces can be many, complex operations can be performed using a short sequence of words and symbols. Custom functions may be used to facilitate access to frequent actions. 
Command-line interfaces are more lightweight, as they only recall information necessary for a task; for example, no preview thumbnails or graphical rendering of web pages. This allows greater efficiency and productivity once many commands are learned. But reaching this level takes some time because the command words may not be easily discoverable or mnemonic. Also, using the command line can become slow and error-prone when users must enter long commands comprising many parameters or several different filenames at once. However, &quot;windows, icons, menus, pointer&quot; (WIMP) interfaces present users with many widgets that represent and can trigger some of the system&#x27;s available commands.

GUIs can be made quite hard when dialogs are buried deep in a system or moved about to different places during redesigns. Also, icons and dialog boxes are usually harder for users to script.

WIMPs extensively use modes, as the meaning of all keys and clicks on specific positions on the screen are redefined all the time. Command-line interfaces use modes only in limited forms, such as for current directory and environment variables.

Most modern operating systems provide both a GUI and some level of a CLI, although the GUIs usually receive more attention.

=== GUI wrappers ===
GUI wrappers find a way around the command-line interface versions (CLI) of (typically) Linux and Unix-like software applications and their text-based UIs or typed command labels. While command-line or text-based applications allow users to run a program non-interactively, GUI wrappers atop them avoid the steep learning curve of the command-line, which requires commands to be typed on the keyboard. By starting a GUI wrapper, users can intuitively interact with, start, stop, and change its working parameters, through graphical icons and visual indicators of a desktop environment, for example. Applications may also provide both interfaces, and when they do the GUI is usually a WIMP wrapper around the command-line version. This is especially common with applications designed for Unix-like operating systems. The latter used to be implemented first because it allowed the developers to focus exclusively on their product&#x27;s functionality without bothering about interface details such as designing icons and placing buttons. Designing programs this way also allows users to run the program in a shell script.

== Three-dimensional graphical user interface ==
Many environments and games use the methods of 3D graphics to project 3D GUI objects onto the screen. The use of 3D graphics has become increasingly common in mainstream operating systems (ex. Windows Aero, and Aqua (MacOS)) to create attractive interfaces, termed eye candy (which includes, for example, the use of drop shadows underneath windows and the cursor), or for functional purposes only possible using three dimensions. For example, user switching is represented by rotating a cube with faces representing each user&#x27;s workspace, and window management is represented via a Rolodex-style flipping mechanism in Windows Vista (see Windows Flip 3D). In both cases, the operating system transforms windows on-the-fly while continuing to update the content of those windows.

The GUI is usually WIMP-based, although occasionally other metaphors surface, such as those used in Microsoft Bob, 3dwm, File System Navigator, File System Visualizer, 3D Mailbox, and GopherVR. Zooming (ZUI) is a related technology that promises to deliver the representation benefits of 3D environments without their usability drawbacks of orientation problems and hidden objects. In 2006, Hillcrest Labs introduced the first ZUI for television. Other innovations include the menus on the PlayStation 2, the menus on the Xbox, Sun&#x27;s Project Looking Glass, Metisse, which was similar to Project Looking Glass, BumpTop, where users can manipulate documents and windows with realistic movement and physics as if they were physical documents, Croquet OS, which is built for collaboration, and compositing window managers such as Enlightenment and Compiz. Augmented reality and virtual reality also make use of 3D GUI elements.

=== In science fiction ===
3D GUIs have appeared in science fiction literature and films, even before certain technologies were feasible or in common use.

* In prose fiction, 3D GUIs have been portrayed as immersible environments, coined as William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;cyberspace&quot; and Neal Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;metaverse&quot; and &quot;avatars&quot;.
* The 1993 American film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; features Silicon Graphics&#x27; 3D file manager File System Navigator, a real-life file manager for Unix operating systems.
* The film &quot;Minority Report&quot; has scenes of police officers using specialized 3D data systems.

<doc id="12295" wikidata="Q211050" url="?curid=12295" title="Gamete">
<text>A gamete (; , ultimately ) is a haploid cell that fuses with another haploid cell during fertilization in organisms that reproduce sexually. Gametes are an organism&#x27;s reproductive cells, also referred to as sex cells. The name gamete was introduced by the German cytologist Eduard Strasburger in 1878.

Gametes of both mating individuals can be the same size and shape, a condition known as isogamy. By contrast, in the majority of species, the gametes are of different sizes, a condition known as anisogamy or heterogamy that applies to humans and other mammals. The human ovum has approximately 100,000 times the volume of a single human sperm cell. The type of gamete an organism produces determines its sex and sets the basis for the sexual roles and sexual selection. In humans and other species that produce two morphologically distinct types of gametes, and in which each individual produces only one type, a female is any individual that produces the larger type of gamete called an ovum, and a male produces the smaller type, called a sperm cell or spermatozoon. Sperm cells are small and motile due to the presence of a tail-shaped structure, the flagellum, that provides propulsion. In contrast, each egg cell or ovum is relatively large and non-motile. 

Oogenesis, the process of female gamete formation in animals, involves meiosis (including meiotic recombination) of a diploid primary oocyte to produce a haploid ovum. Spermatogenesis, the process of male gamete formation in animals, involves meiosis in a diploid primary spermatocyte to produce haploid spermatozoa. In animals, ova are produced in the ovaries of females and sperm develop in the testes of males. During fertilization, a spermatozoon and an ovum, each carrying half of the genetic information of an individual, unite to form a zygote that develops into a new diploid organism.

== Evolution ==
It is generally accepted that isogamy is the ancestral state from which anisogamy and oogamy evolved, although its evolution has left no fossil records. There are almost invariably only two gamete types, all analyses showing that intermediate gamete sizes are eliminated due to selection. Since intermediate sized gametes do not have the same advantages as small or large ones, they do worse than small ones in mobility and numbers, and worse than large ones in supply.

==Differences between gametes and somatic cells==
In contrast to a gamete, which has only one set of chromosomes, a diploid somatic cell has two sets of homologous chromosomes, one of which is a copy of the chromosome set from the sperm and one a copy of the chromosome set from the egg cell. Recombination of the genes during meiosis ensures that the chromosomes of gametes are not exact duplicates of either of the sets of chromosomes carried in the parental diploid chromosomes but a mixture of the two.
==Artificial gametes==
Artificial gametes, also known as in vitro derived gametes (IVD), stem cell-derived gametes (SCDGs), and in vitro generated gametes (IVG), are gametes derived from stem cells. The use of such artificial gametes would &quot;necessarily require IVF techniques&quot;. Research shows that artificial gametes may be a reproductive technique for same-sex male couples, although a surrogate mother would still be required for the gestation period. Women who have passed menopause may be able to produce eggs and bear genetically related children with artificial gametes. Robert Sparrow wrote, in the Journal of Medical Ethics, that embryos derived from artificial gametes could be used to derive new gametes and this process could be repeated to create multiple human generations in the laboratory. This technique could be used to create cell lines for medical applications and for studying the heredity of genetic disorders. Additionally, this technique could be used for human enhancement by selectively breeding for a desired genome or by using recombinant DNA technology to create enhancements that have not arisen in nature.

==Plants==
Plants that reproduce sexually also produce gametes. However, since plants have a life cycle involving alternation of diploid and haploid generations some differences from animal life cycles exist. Plants use meiosis to produce spores that develop into multicellular haploid gametophytes which produce gametes by mitosis. In animals there is no corresponding multicellular haploid phase. The sperm of plants that reproduce using spores are formed by mitosis in an organ of the gametophyte known as the antheridium and the egg cells by mitosis in a flask-shaped organ called the archegonium. Plant sperm cells are their only motile cells, often described as flagellate, but more correctly as ciliate. Bryophytes have 2 flagella, horsetails have up to 200 and the mature spermatozoa of the cycad &quot;Zamia pumila&quot; has up to 50,000 flagella. Cycads and &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; are the only gymnosperms with motile sperm. In the flowering plants, the female gametophyte is produced inside the ovule within the ovary of the flower. When mature, the haploid gametophyte produces female gametes which are ready for fertilization. The male gametophyte is produced inside a pollen grain within the anther and is non-motile, but can be distributed by wind, water or animal vectors. When a pollen grain lands on a mature stigma of a flower it germinates to form a pollen tube that grows down the style into the ovary of the flower and then into the ovule. The pollen then produces non-motile sperm nuclei by mitosis that are transported down the pollen tube to the ovule where they are released for fertilization of the egg cell.

<doc id="12300" wikidata="Q181677" url="?curid=12300" title="George R. R. Martin">
<text>George Raymond Richard Martin (born George Raymond Martin; September 20, 1948) also known by the initials G.R.R.M. is an American author, television writer, and television producer. He is best known as the author of the series of epic fantasy novels &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, which were adapted into the Primetime Emmy Award–winning television series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; (2011–2019) and its prequel series &quot;House of the Dragon&quot; (2022–present). He also helped create the &quot;Wild Cards&quot; anthology series and contributed worldbuilding for the video game &quot;Elden Ring&quot; (2022).

In 2005, Lev Grossman of &quot;Time&quot; called Martin &quot;the American Tolkien&quot;, and in 2011, he was included on the annual &quot;Time&quot; 100 list of the most influential people in the world. He is a longtime resident of Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he helped fund Meow Wolf and owns the Jean Cocteau Cinema. The city commemorates March 29 as George R. R. Martin Day.

== Early life ==
George Raymond Martin (he adopted the confirmation name &quot;Richard&quot; at 13 years old) was born on September 20, 1948, in Bayonne, New Jersey, the son of longshoreman Raymond Collins Martin and Margaret Brady Martin. His mother&#x27;s family had once been wealthy, owning a successful construction business, but lost it all in the Great Depression, something Martin was reminded about every day when he passed what used to be his family&#x27;s dock and house. He has two younger sisters, Darleen and Jane. He is predominantly of Irish descent; a DNA test on the series &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; showed him to be 53.6% &quot;British and Irish&quot;, 22.4% Ashkenazi Jewish, and 15.6% &quot;Broadly Northwestern European&quot;.

The family first lived in a house on Broadway belonging to Martin&#x27;s great-grandmother. In 1953, they moved to a federal housing project near the Bayonne docks. During Martin&#x27;s childhood, his world consisted predominantly of &quot;First Street to Fifth Street&quot;, between his grade school and his home. This limited world made him want to travel and experience other places, but the only way of doing so was through his imagination, and he became a voracious reader.

Martin began writing and selling monster stories for pennies to other neighborhood children, dramatic readings included. He had to stop once a customer&#x27;s mother complained about her child&#x27;s nightmares. He also wrote stories about a mythical kingdom populated by his pet turtles — the turtles died frequently in their toy castle, so he decided they were killing each other off in &quot;sinister plots&quot;. Martin had a habit of starting &quot;endless stories&quot; that he never completed, as they did not turn out as well on paper as he had imagined them.

Martin attended Mary Jane Donohoe School and later Marist High School. While there, he became an avid comic-book fan, developing a strong interest in the superheroes being published by Marvel Comics, and later credited Stan Lee for being one of his greatest literary influences; &quot;Maybe Stan Lee is the greatest literary influence on me, even more than Shakespeare or Tolkien.&quot; A letter Martin wrote to the editor of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; was printed in issue #20 (November 1963); it was the first of many sent, e.g., &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #32, #34, and others. Fans who read his letters wrote him letters in turn, and through such contacts, Martin joined the fledgling comics fandom of the era, writing fiction for various fanzines; he bought the first ticket to the world&#x27;s first Comic-Con, held in New York in 1964. In 1965, Martin won comic fandom&#x27;s Alley Award for Best Fan Fiction for his prose superhero story &quot;Powerman vs. The Blue Barrier&quot;.

In 1970, Martin earned a B.S. in journalism with a minor in history from Northwestern University&#x27;s Medill School of Journalism in Evanston, Illinois, graduating &quot;summa cum laude&quot;; he went on to complete his M.S. in Journalism in 1971, also from Medill. Eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War, to which he objected, Martin applied for and obtained conscientious objector status; he instead did alternative service work for two years (1972–1974) as a VISTA volunteer, attached to the Cook County Legal Assistance Foundation.

== Career ==

=== Early writing career ===
Martin began selling science fiction short stories professionally in 1970, at age 21. His first sale was &quot;The Hero&quot;, sold to &quot;Galaxy&quot; magazine and published in its February 1971 issue; other sales soon followed. His first story to be nominated for the Hugo Award and Nebula Awards was &quot;With Morning Comes Mistfall&quot;, published in 1973 in &quot;Analog&quot; magazine. In 1975 his story &quot;...for a single yesterday&quot; about a post-apocalyptic timetripper was selected for inclusion in &quot;Epoch&quot;, a science fiction anthology edited by Roger Elwood and Robert Silverberg. His first novel, &quot;Dying of the Light&quot;, was completed in 1976 right before he moved to Dubuque and published in 1977. That same year the enormous success of &quot;Star Wars&quot; had a huge impact on the publishing industry and science fiction, and he sold the novel for the same amount he would make in three years of teaching.

The short stories he was able to sell in his early 20s gave him some profit but not enough to pay his bills, which prevented him from becoming the full-time writer he wanted to be. The need for a day job occurred simultaneously with the American chess craze which followed Bobby Fischer&#x27;s victory in the 1972 world chess championship. Martin&#x27;s own chess skills and experience allowed him to be hired as a tournament director for the Continental Chess Association, which ran chess tournaments on the weekends. This gave him a sufficient income, and because the tournaments only ran on Saturdays and Sundays, it allowed him to work as a writer five days a week from 1973 to 1976. By the time the chess craze subsided and no longer provided an income, he had become much better established as a writer.

=== Teaching ===
In the mid-1970s, Martin met English professor George Guthridge from Dubuque, Iowa, at a science fiction convention in Milwaukee. Martin persuaded Guthridge (who later said that at that time he despised science fiction and fantasy) not only to give speculative fiction a second look, but also to write in the field himself. Guthridge has since been a finalist for the Hugo Award and twice for the Nebula Award for science fiction and fantasy. In 1998, Guthridge and Janet Berliner won the Bram Stoker Award for Superior Achievement in the Novel for their &quot;Children of the Dusk&quot;.

In turn, Guthridge helped Martin in finding a job at Clarke University (then Clarke College). Martin &quot;wasn&#x27;t making enough money to stay alive&quot; from writing and the chess tournaments, said Guthridge. From 1976 to 1978, Martin was an English and journalism instructor at Clarke, and he became Writer In Residence at the college from 1978 to 1979.

=== Concentration on writing ===
While he enjoyed teaching, the sudden death of friend and fellow author Tom Reamy in late 1977 made Martin reevaluate his own life, and he eventually decided to try to become a full-time writer. In 1979 he resigned from his job and moved from Dubuque to Santa Fe, New Mexico at the end of the year. There he would live alone for almost three years, a period he described as tremendously productive in regard to writing.

Martin is a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA); he served as the organization&#x27;s Southwest Regional Director from 1977 to 1979, and as its vice-president from 1996 to 1998. In 1976, for Kansas City&#x27;s MidAmeriCon, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), Martin and his friend and fellow writer-editor Gardner Dozois conceived of and organized the first Hugo Losers&#x27; Party for the benefit of all past and present Hugo-losing writers on the evening following the convention&#x27;s Hugo Awards ceremony. Martin was nominated for two Hugos that year but lost both awards, for the novelette &quot;...and Seven Times Never Kill Man&quot; and the novella &quot;The Storms of Windhaven&quot;, co-written with Lisa Tuttle. Although Martin often writes fantasy or horror, a number of his earlier works are science fiction tales occurring in a loosely defined future history, known informally as &quot;The Thousand Worlds&quot; or &quot;The Manrealm&quot;.

In 2017, Martin recalled that he had started writing science fiction-horror hybrids in the late 1970s to disprove a statement from a critic claiming that science fiction and horror were opposites and therefore incompatible. Martin considered &quot;Sandkings&quot; (1979) the best known of these. Another was the novella &quot;Nightflyers&quot; (1980), whose screen and television rights were purchased by Vista in 1984, which produced a 1987 film adaptation, &quot;Nightflyers&quot;, with a screenplay co-written by Martin. Martin was unhappy about having to cut plot elements in order to accommodate the film&#x27;s small budget. While not a hit at theatres, Martin believes that the film saved his career, and that everything he has written since exists in large part because of it. He has also written at least one piece of political-military fiction, &quot;Night of the Vampyres&quot;, collected in Harry Turtledove&#x27;s anthology &quot;The Best Military Science Fiction of the 20th Century&quot; (2001).

In 1982, Martin published a vampire novel titled &quot;Fevre Dream&quot; set in the 19th century on the Mississippi River, in the heyday of the great paddle steamers. Unlike traditional vampire novels, in &quot;Fevre Dream&quot; vampires are not supernatural creatures, but are rather a different species related to humans created by evolution with superhuman powers. Critic Don D&#x27;Amassa has praised &quot;Fevre Dream&quot; for its strong 19th-century atmosphere and wrote: &quot;This is without question one of the greatest vampire novels of all time&quot;. Martin followed up &quot;Fevre Dream&quot; with another horror novel, &quot;The Armageddon Rag&quot; (1983). The unexpected commercial failure of &quot;The Armageddon Rag&quot; &quot;essentially destroyed my career as a novelist at the time&quot;, he recalled, and made him consider going into real estate instead.

In 1984, the new editor of Baen Books, Betsy Mitchell, called Martin to ask him if he had considered doing a collection of Haviland Tuf adventures. Martin, who had several favorite series characters like Solomon Kane, Elric, Nicholas van Rijn and Magnus Ridolph, had made an attempt to create such a character on his own in the 1970s with his Tuf stories. He was interested, but was too occupied with the writing of his next book, the never-completed novel &quot;Black and White and Red All Over&quot;, which occupied most of his writing time the same year. But after the failure of &quot;The Armageddon Rag&quot;, all editors rejected his upcoming novel, and desperate for money, he accepted Mitchell&#x27;s offer and wrote some more Tuf stories which were collected in &quot;Tuf Voyaging&quot;, which sold well enough for Mitchell to suggest a sequel. Martin was willing and agreed to do it, but before he got started he got an offer from Hollywood, where producer Philip DeGuere Jr. wanted to adapt &quot;The Armageddon Rag&quot; into a film. The film adaptation did not happen, but they stayed in touch, and when DeGuere became the producer for the revival of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, Martin was offered a job as a writer. Working for television paid a lot better than writing literature, so he decided to move to Hollywood to seek a new career. At first he worked as staff writer for the show, and then as an executive story consultant.

After the CBS series was cancelled, Martin migrated over to the already-underway satirical science fiction series &quot;Max Headroom&quot;. He worked on scripts and created the show&#x27;s &quot;Ped Xing&quot; character. However, before his scripts could go into production, the ABC show was cancelled in the middle of its second season. Martin was hired as a writer-producer on the new dramatic fantasy series &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;; in 1989, he became the show&#x27;s co-supervising producer and wrote 14 of its episodes.

In 1987, Martin published a collection of short horror stories in &quot;Portraits of His Children&quot;. During this same period, Martin continued working in print media as a book-series editor, this time overseeing the development of the multi-author &quot;Wild Cards&quot; book series, which takes place in a shared universe in which a small slice of post–World War II humanity gains superpowers after the release of an alien-engineered virus; new titles are published in the ongoing series from Tor Books. In &quot;Second Person&quot;, Martin &quot;gives a personal account of the close-knit role-playing game (RPG) culture that gave rise to his &quot;Wild Cards&quot; shared-world anthologies&quot;. An important element in the creation of the multiple-author series was a campaign of Chaosium&#x27;s role-playing game &quot;Superworld&quot; (1983) that Martin ran in Albuquerque. Admitting he became completely obsessed with the game, he stopped writing literature for most of 1983, which he refers to as his &quot;lost year&quot;, but his shrinking bank accounts made him realize he had to come up with something, and got the idea that perhaps the stories and characters created in &quot;Superworld&quot; could somehow become profitable. Martin&#x27;s own contributions to &quot;Wild Cards&quot; have included Thomas Tudbury, &quot;The Great and Powerful Turtle&quot;, a powerful psychokinetic whose flying &quot;shell&quot; consisted of an armored VW Beetle. , 21 &quot;Wild Cards&quot; volumes had been published in the series; earlier that same year, Martin signed the contract for the 22nd volume, &quot;Low Ball&quot; (2014), published by Tor Books. In early 2012, Martin signed another Tor contract for the 23rd &quot;Wild Cards&quot; volume, &quot;High Stakes&quot;, which was released in August 2016.

In August 2016, Martin announced that Universal Cable Productions had acquired the rights to adapt the &quot;Wild Cards&quot; novels into a television series. He noted that he himself would not write for the adaptation due to focusing on &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;.

In 2014, Martin said in a BBC interview that he writes using WordStar editor software, on an MS-DOS computer, because he dislikes having his work spell-checked and to avoid internet distractions. He uses a separate computer for common internet tasks.

=== &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; ===
In 1991, Martin briefly returned to writing novels. He had grown frustrated that his TV pilots and screenplays were not getting made and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes. This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising his imagination. Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.

His epic fantasy series, &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, was inspired by the Wars of the Roses, &quot;The Accursed Kings&quot; and &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;. Though Martin originally conceptualized it as being three volumes, it is currently slated to comprise seven. The first, &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, was published in 1996, followed by &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; in 1998 and &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; in 2000. In November 2005, &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;, the fourth novel in this series, became &quot;The New York Times&quot; No. 1 Bestseller. The fifth book, &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, was published July 12, 2011, and became an international bestseller, including achieving a No. 1 spot on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller List and many others; it remained on the &quot;New York Times&quot; list for 88 weeks.

In 2012, &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; made the final ballot for science fiction and fantasy&#x27;s Hugo Award, World Fantasy Award, Locus Poll Award, and the British Fantasy Award; the novel went on to win the Locus Poll Award for Best Fantasy Novel. Two more novels are planned in the series: &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot; and the final volume &quot;A Dream of Spring&quot;.

On April 25, 2018, Martin announced the release date of his new book, &quot;Fire &amp; Blood&quot;, dealing with the history of House Targaryen, which was released on November 20, 2018. Should Martin die before finishing the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series, former collaborators have said that they will not conclude the series for him.

==== HBO adaptation of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; ====

HBO Productions purchased the television rights for the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series in 2007. Although busy completing &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; and other projects, George R. R. Martin was heavily involved in the production of the television series adaptation of his books. Martin&#x27;s involvement included the selection of a production team and participation in scriptwriting; the opening credits list him as a co-executive producer of the series. The original pilot was shot between October 24 and November 19, 2009, on location in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Morocco. It was received so poorly by HBO executives that they did not make a decision for four months after the pilot was delivered. In March 2010, HBO&#x27;s decision to greenlight the series was announced, with the production of the series scheduled to start June 2010. HBO however demanded the first episode be reshot, and wanted all the scenes from Morocco scrapped. The first episode (&quot;Winter Is Coming&quot;) premiered on HBO in the United States and Canada on April 17, 2011. It was seen initially by 2.2 million viewers. The first season was nominated for 13 Emmy Awards, ultimately winning two: one for its opening title credits, and one for Peter Dinklage as Best Supporting Actor.

HBO ordered a second season of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; on April 19, 2011, two days after the series premiere. The second season obtained a 15% increase in budget in order to be able to stage the war&#x27;s most important battle, the Battle of the Blackwater, in episode nine which was written by George R. R. Martin. Filming took place during 106 shooting days. During three-quarters of those, two crews (&quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Wolf&quot;) were working simultaneously in different locations. Alan Taylor was promoted to co-executive producer and directed four episodes, including the season premiere and finale. David Petrarca and David Nutter each directed two episodes, while series cinematographer Alik Sakharov and filmmaker Neil Marshall directed the remaining two. The second season premiered in the United States on HBO on April 1, 2012, and concluded on June 3, 2012. U.S. viewership rose by approximately 8% over the course of the season, from 3.9 million to 4.2 million by the season finale. The second season won six of the twelve Emmy Awards for which it was nominated.

&quot;Game of Thrones&quot; rapidly became a critical and commercial success after the second season. HBO renewed the series for a third season on April 10, 2012, nine days after the second season&#x27;s premiere. Production began in July 2012 and concluded with the wrap of the unit filming in Iceland on November 24, 2012. The third season is based on the first half of the novel &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;. Benioff had previously said that &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; would need to be adapted in two seasons on account of its length. Benioff and Weiss also noted that they thought of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; as an adaptation of the series as a whole, rather than of individual novels, which gave them the liberty to move scenes back and forth across novels according to the requirements of the screen adaptation. Season 3 saw the first significant use of the Valyrian languages, spoken in doomed Valyria and its former colonies in Essos. The constructed languages were developed by linguist David J. Peterson based on the few words Martin invented for the novels. Peterson had previously developed the Dothraki language, used principally in season 1. The third season premiered on HBO on March 31, 2013, and concluded on June 9, 2013. The third season was seen by 14.2 million viewers. It won 2 of the 16 Emmy Awards for which it was nominated.

Two days after third-season premiere, HBO ordered the fourth season on April 2, 2013, which began filming in July 2013. The season is adapted primarily from the second half of &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;, along with elements of &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; and &quot;A Dance with Dragons.&quot; Showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss co-wrote seven out of ten episodes. The remaining three episodes were written by Bryan Cogman (two episodes), and George R. R. Martin (one episode). For this season, the filming lasted 136 days and was completed on November 21, 2013. The fourth season premiered in the United States on HBO on April 6, 2014, and concluded on June 15, 2014. The season was met with largely positive reviews. It won 4 of the 19 Emmy Awards for which it was nominated. With its fourth season, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; has become the most-watched HBO series in history (surpassing the fourth season of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; which had a gross audience of 18.2 million viewers), averaging 18.4 million viewers across multiple platforms, including live viewing, encores, DVR views, HBO GO and On Demand views.

Up until the fourth season, Martin wrote one episode for each season. In 2022, Martin said that he had been estranged from the show during the production process of the last 4 seasons (starting with season 5). In the early seasons, Martin wrote and read scripts, consulted on casting decisions and visited sets. Over time, however, he stepped back to focus on his long-delayed next &quot;Thrones&quot; novel, &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot;. Following the gargantuan success of the fourth season, HBO ordered the fifth season on April 8, 2014, together with the sixth season, which began filming in July 2014. The season primarily adapts the storylines from &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; and &quot;A Dance with Dragons,&quot; also with original content not found in Martin&#x27;s novels. This season set a Guinness World Record for winning the highest number of Emmy Awards for a series in a single season and year, winning 12 out of 24 nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series.

With a budget over $100 million for the whole season, filming for the sixth season began in July 2015 and ended on December. The season filmed in five different countries: Northern Ireland, Spain, Croatia, Iceland, and Canada. This season saw the overall plot of the show diverging from the source material. Some of the season&#x27;s storyline is derived from content not yet published in Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series, although a significant amount of material from &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;, &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; and the upcoming sixth novel &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot;, which Martin previously outlined to showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, was used. The season was largely met with positive reviews. The &quot;Battle of the Bastards&quot; episode received immense critical acclaim, with many calling it one of the best television episodes of all time. U.S. viewership rose compared to the previous season, and by approximately 13 percent over its course, from 7.9 million to 8.9 million by the finale. The season won 12 of the 23 Emmy Awards for which it was nominated.

Three days before the premiere of the episode &quot;The Red Woman&quot;, HBO ordered the seventh season. Due to necessary weather conditions required for filming, the production of the penultimate season of the show was delayed that year. Filming began only on August 31, 2016, at Titanic Studios in Belfast, and ended in February 2017. Unlike previous seasons, the seventh and eighth seasons largely consisted of original content not found in the source material. This season comprised only seven episodes. The showrunners stated that they were unable to produce 10 episodes in the show&#x27;s usual 12 to 14 month time frame, as Weiss said &quot;It&#x27;s crossing out of a television schedule into more of a mid-range movie schedule&quot;. The average runtime of an episode in this season was approximately 63 minutes. The series received 22 nominations for the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards and won 9 of them, including &quot;Outstanding Drama Series&quot;.

Unlike its prior seasons, the final one took a year gap for its production and filming. The eighth season consisted of only six episodes, though the average runtime of an episode was 68 minutes, the longest of all seasons, with &quot;The Long Night&quot; consisting of 81 minutes. The season was met with mixed reviews from critics. While the performances, production values and music score were praised, criticism was mainly directed at the shorter runtime of the season as well as numerous creative decisions made by the showrunners. Many commentators deemed it to be a disappointing conclusion to the series. Despite this, the season received 32 nominations at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards, the most for a single season of television in history, and won twelve, including Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for Peter Dinklage.

Three years after the show ended, a prequel series, &quot;House of the Dragon&quot;, premiered on HBO on August 21, 2022. Based on parts of the novel &quot;Fire &amp; Blood&quot;, the series is set about 200 years before the events of &quot;Game of Thrones.&quot; Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season. Five days after its premiere, the series was renewed for a second season by HBO. On September 1, Sapochnik departed as showrunner, with another veteran Game of Thrones director Alan Taylor replacing him as the co-showrunner for the upcoming second season.

In June 2022, it was reported that a Jon Snow sequel series with Kit Harington to reprise his role was in early development at HBO. The working title is &quot;Snow&quot; and Martin confirmed his involvement with the project and that Harington initiated the idea. Also in June, Martin said there were still three other live-action series in development: &quot;10,000 Ships&quot; (written by Amanda Segal), &quot;9 Voyages&quot; aka &quot;Sea Snake&quot; (written by Bruno Heller), and the Dunk &amp; Egg prequel series (written by Steven Conrad), tentatively titled either &quot;The Hedge Knight&quot; or &quot;Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.&quot;

In January 2021, an animated drama series was announced as in development at HBO Max. In July 2021, two more animated series were in development at HBO Max, with one being set in Yi Ti, a nation in Essos loosely based on Imperial China.

=== Themes ===

Martin&#x27;s work has been described as having &quot;complex story lines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing&quot; by literary critic Jeff VanderMeer. Dana Jennings of the &quot;New York Times&quot; described Martin&#x27;s work as &quot;fantasy for grown ups&quot; and Lev Grossman wrote that it was dark and cynical. Martin&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Dying of the Light&quot;, set the tone for some of his future work; it unfolds on a mostly abandoned planet that is slowly becoming uninhabitable as it moves away from its sun. This story has a strong sense of melancholy. His characters are often unhappy or, at least, unsatisfied, in many cases holding on to idealisms in spite of an otherwise chaotic and ruthless world, and often troubled by their own self-seeking or violent actions, even as they undertake them. Many have elements of tragic heroes or antiheroes in them; reviewer T. M. Wagner writes: &quot;Let it never be said Martin doesn&#x27;t share Shakespeare&#x27;s fondness for the senselessly tragic.&quot;

The overall gloominess of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; can be an obstacle for some readers; the Inchoatus Group writes that, &quot;If this absence of joy is going to trouble you, or you&#x27;re looking for something more affirming, then you should probably seek elsewhere.&quot; However, for many fans, it is precisely this level of &quot;realness&quot; and &quot;completeness&quot; – including many characters&#x27; imperfections, moral and ethical ambiguity, and (often sudden) consequential plot twists that is endearing about Martin&#x27;s work. Many find that this is what makes the series&#x27; story arcs compelling enough to keep following despite its sheer brutality and intricately messy and interwoven plotlines; as TM Wagner points out:There&#x27;s great tragedy here, but there&#x27;s also excitement, humor, heroism even in weaklings, nobility even in villains, and, now and then, a taste of justice after all. It&#x27;s a rare gift when a writer can invest his story with that much humanity.Martin&#x27;s characters are multifaceted, each with intricate pasts, aspirations, and ambitions. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; writes of his ongoing epic fantasy &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;: &quot;The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us care about their fates.&quot; Misfortune, injury, and death (including false death and reanimation) often befall major or minor characters, no matter how attached the reader has become. Martin has described his penchant for killing off important characters as being necessary for the story&#x27;s depth: &quot;when my characters are in danger, I want you to be afraid to turn the page, (so) you need to show right from the beginning that you&#x27;re playing for keeps&quot;.

In distinguishing his work from others, Martin makes a point of emphasizing realism and plausible social dynamics above an over-reliance on magic and a simplistic &quot;good versus evil&quot; dichotomy, for which contemporary fantasy writing is often criticized. Notably, Martin&#x27;s work makes a sharp departure from the prevalent &quot;heroic knights and chivalry&quot; schema that has become a mainstay in fantasy as derived from J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. He specifically critiques the oversimplification of Tolkien&#x27;s themes and devices by imitators in ways that he has humorously described as &quot;Disneyland Middle Ages&quot;, which gloss over or ignore major differences between medieval and modern societies, particularly social structures, ways of living, and political arrangements. Martin has been described as &quot;the American Tolkien&quot; by literary critics. While Martin finds inspiration in Tolkien&#x27;s legacy, he aims to go beyond what he sees as Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;medieval philosophy&quot; of &quot;if the king was a good man, the land would prosper&quot; to delve into the complexities, ambiguities, and vagaries of real-life power: &quot;We look at real history and it&#x27;s not that simple... Just having good intentions doesn&#x27;t make you a wise king.&quot; Per this fact Martin has been credited with the rise of grimdark fantasy, a modern form of an &quot;anti-Tolkien&quot; approach to fantasy writing which, according to British science fiction and fantasy novelist Adam Roberts, is characterized by its reaction to Tolkien&#x27;s idealism even though it owes a lot to Tolkien&#x27;s work. The Canadian fantasy writer R. Scott Bakker &quot;says he wouldn&#x27;t have been able to publish his fantasy novels without the success George R. R. Martin achieved first&quot;. Similarly, Mark Lawrence, author of &quot;Prince of Thorns&quot;, was inspired by Martin and impressed by his Red Wedding scene.

The author makes a point of grounding his work on a foundation of historical fiction, which he channels to evoke important social and political elements of primarily the European medieval era that differ markedly from elements of modern times, including the multigenerational, rigid, and often brutally consequential nature of the hierarchical class system of feudal societies that is in many cases overlooked in fantasy writing. Even as &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; is a fantasy series that employs magic and the surreal as central to the genre, Martin is keen to ensure that magic is merely one element of many that moves his work forward, not a generic deus ex machina that is itself the focus of his stories, which is something he has been very conscious about since reading Tolkien; &quot;If you look at &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, what strikes you, it certainly struck me, is that although the world is infused with this great sense of magic, there is very little onstage magic. So you have a sense of magic, but it&#x27;s kept under very tight control, and I really took that to heart when I was starting my own series.&quot; Martin&#x27;s ultimate aim is an exploration of the internal conflicts that define the human condition, which, in deriving inspiration from William Faulkner, he ultimately describes as the only reason to read any literature, regardless of genre.

In 2018, Martin called &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, &quot;Catch-22&quot;, and &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; &quot;favorites all, towering masterpieces, books that changed my life&quot;.

== Producing ==
In 2017, Martin confirmed he would serve as an executive producer of the HBO television series adaptation of the 2010 science fantasy novel &quot;Who Fears Death&quot; by Nnedi Okorafor. Martin also contributed to the 2022 video game titled &quot;Elden Ring&quot;, writing the worldbuilding aspects for it. In February 2021, it was reported that Martin and Kalinda Vazquez were developing a TV adaptation of &quot;Roadmarks&quot; by Roger Zelazny, which Martin pitched to HBO in 2020. Martin will be an executive producer, Vazquez the showrunner, writer and executive producer. In March 2021, he signed an overall deal with HBO. Martin will serve as an executive producer of the Peacock TV adaptation in development of his &quot;Wild Cards&quot; book series, together with Melinda M. Snodgrass and Vince Gerardis, Martin&#x27;s manager. He will serve as an executive producer of the 2022 AMC series &quot;Dark Winds&quot; based on Tony Hillerman&#x27;s Leaphorn &amp; Chee books, together with the creator Graham Roland, the showrunner Vince Calandra, the lead Zahn McClarnon, Kiowa Gordon, Chris Eyre, Robert Redford, Tina Elmo and Vince Gerardis. In 2021, Martin served as one of the producers of the short film &quot;Night of the Cooters&quot; based on the eponymous short story by Howard Waldrop.

== Relationship with fans ==

Martin actively contributes to his blog, &quot;Not a Blog&quot;; in April 2018, he moved his blog from Livejournal to his own website.

Martin&#x27;s official fan club is the &quot;Brotherhood Without Banners&quot;, which has a regular posting board at the Forum of the website westeros.org, which is focused on his &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; fantasy series. At the annual World Science Fiction Convention every year, the Brotherhood Without Banners hosts a large, on-going hospitality suite that is open to all members of the Worldcon.

Martin is opposed to fan fiction, which he views as copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers in terms of developing skills in worldbuilding and character development.

=== Conventions ===
Martin is known for his regular attendance at science fiction conventions and comics conventions, and his accessibility to fans. In the early 1980s, critic and writer Thomas Disch identified Martin as a member of the &quot;Labor Day Group&quot;, writers who regularly congregated at the annual Worldcon, usually held on or around the Labor Day weekend. Since the early 1970s, he has also attended regional science fiction conventions; further, since 1986, Martin has participated annually in Albuquerque&#x27;s smaller regional convention Bubonicon, near his New Mexico home. He was the Guest of Honor at the 61st World Science Fiction Convention in Toronto, held in 2003.

In December 2016, Martin was a key speaker at the Guadalajara International Book Fair 2016 in Mexico where the author provided hints about the next two books in the series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;.

In 2020, Martin fulfilled his duties as “toastmaster” of the Hugo Awards. During the event, he mispronounced several names, including that of R. F. Kuang, which she considered a microaggression. Martin later apologized for mispronouncing the names.

=== Writing pace ===
Martin has been criticized by some of his readers for the long periods between books in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series, notably the six-year gap between the fourth volume, &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; (2005), and the fifth volume, &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; (2011), and the fact that &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot;, the next volume in the series, is still unpublished as of February 2025. In 2010, Martin had responded to fan criticisms by saying he was unwilling to write only his &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series, noting that working on other prose and compiling and editing different book projects have always been part of his working process.

== Personal life ==
In the early 1970s, Martin was in a relationship with fellow science fiction/fantasy author Lisa Tuttle, with whom he co-wrote &quot;Windhaven&quot;.
While attending an East Coast science fiction convention he met his first wife, Gale Burnick; they were married in 1975 and moved from their Chicago apartment and into a house in Dubuque in 1976. Both of them grew tired of the hard winters there, and when she graduated from Clarke University in June 1979, he resigned from his job and they decided to move to New Mexico. The year before they had &quot;fallen in love&quot; with Santa Fe on their way to the 36th World Science Fiction Convention which was being held in Phoenix. His wife went down and bought a house while Martin stayed behind to sell their home and finish the semester. The marriage ended in divorce in 1979, before they could be reunited in Santa Fe. Instead he settled there alone from December that same year until September 1981, when what would be his longtime partner Parris McBride moved in with him. On February 15, 2011, Martin married McBride during a small ceremony at their Santa Fe home. On August 19, 2011, they held a larger wedding ceremony and reception at Renovation, the 69th World Science Fiction Convention. They have no children.

He and McBride are supporters of the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary in New Mexico. In early 2013, he purchased Santa Fe&#x27;s Jean Cocteau Cinema and Coffee House, which had been closed since 2006. He had the property completely restored, including both its original 35mm capability to which was added digital projection and sound; the Cocteau officially reopened for business on August 9, 2013. In 2019, he opened a bookstore named Beastly Books, after Beauty and the Beast, next to Jean Cocteau. Martin has also supported Meow Wolf, an arts collective in Santa Fe, having pledged $2.7 million toward a new art space in January 2015.

In response to a question on his religious views, Martin replied: &quot;I suppose I&#x27;m a lapsed Catholic. You would consider me an atheist or agnostic. I find religion and spirituality fascinating. I would like to believe this isn&#x27;t the end and there&#x27;s something more, but I can&#x27;t convince the rational part of me that makes any sense whatsoever.&quot;

Martin is a fan of the New York Jets, the New York Giants and the New York Mets. He is also a fan of the Grateful Dead, and says that the band&#x27;s music may have influenced his work.

Martin made a guest appearance as himself in an episode, &quot;El Skeletorito&quot;, of the Adult Swim show &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;. He also appeared in SyFy&#x27;s &quot;Z Nation&quot; as a zombie version of himself in season two&#x27;s &quot;The Collector&quot;, where he is still signing copies of his new novel. In &quot;Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!&quot;, he is killed when watching a movie at the theatre.

== Philanthropy ==
In 2014, Martin launched a campaign on Prizeo to raise funds for Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary and the Food Depot of Santa Fe. As part of the campaign, Martin offered one donor the chance to accompany him on a trip to the wolf sanctuary, including a helicopter ride and dinner. Martin also offered those donating $20,000 or more the opportunity to have a character named after them and &quot;killed off&quot; in an upcoming &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; novel. The campaign garnered media attention and raised a total of $502,549.

In 2017, Martin announced that he was funding The Miskatonic Scholarship. The Miskatonic Scholarship allows a writer of Lovecraftian cosmic horror to attend the Odyssey Writing Workshop, a six-week writing workshop held at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire.

== Politics ==
Growing up, Martin avoided the draft to the Vietnam War by being a conscientious objector and did two years of alternative service. He generally opposes war and thought the Vietnam War was a &quot;terrible mistake for America&quot;.

While he did not endorse Barack Obama in 2008, Martin endorsed him for re-election in 2012 calling Obama the most intelligent president since Jimmy Carter. In 2014, Martin endorsed Democratic Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico.

In the midst of pressure to pull the 2014 feature film &quot;The Interview&quot; from theaters, the Jean Cocteau Cinema in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which has been owned by Martin since 2013, decided to show the film. Theater manager Jon Bowman told the &quot;Santa Fe New Mexican&quot;, &quot;Martin feels strongly about the First Amendment and the idea of artists having the ability to speak their minds and not having to worry about being targets.&quot;

Immediately following Bernie Sanders&#x27; defeat in the U.S. Democratic primary elections, he supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general 2016 United States presidential election, and criticized Donald Trump during the election and following her defeat, commenting that Trump would &quot;become the worst president in American history&quot;. In response to fans of Martin who compared Trump favorably to characters from &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, Martin doubled-down on his criticism of Trump by making the case to his fans that Trump shares many personality traits in common with King Joffrey, a near-universally hated character from the series, concluding that &quot;Trump is a Grown-Up Joffrey.&quot;

In May 2019, Martin endorsed Joe Biden for president in 2020.

<text>A Song of Ice and Fire is a series of high fantasy novels by the American author George R. R. Martin. He began writing the first volume, &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, in 1991, and published it in 1996. Martin, who originally envisioned the series as a trilogy, has released five out of seven planned volumes. The fifth entry in the series, &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, was published in 2011. Martin continues to write the sixth novel, titled &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot;. A seventh novel, &quot;A Dream of Spring&quot;, is planned to follow.

&quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; depicts a violent world dominated by political realism. What little supernatural power exists is confined to the margins of the known world. Moral ambiguity pervades the books, and their stories continually raise questions concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety, and the morality of violence. The story unfolds through a rotating set of subjective points of view, the success or survival of any of which is never assured. Each chapter is told from a limited third-person perspective, drawn from a group of characters that grows from nine in the first novel to 31 by the fifth.

The novels are set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos (the world as a whole does not have an established name). Martin&#x27;s stated inspirations for the series include the Wars of the Roses and &quot;The Accursed Kings,&quot; a series of French historical novels by Maurice Druon. The work as a whole consists of three interwoven plots: a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the growing threat posed by the powerful supernatural Others from the northernmost region of Westeros, and the ambition of the surviving members of the dethroned Targaryen dynasty to return from their exile in Essos and reassume the Iron Throne.

As of 2015, more than 90 million copies in 47 languages had been sold. The fourth and fifth volumes reached the top of the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller lists when published in 2005 and 2011. Among the many derived works are several prequel novellas, two television series, a comic book adaptation, and several card, board, and video games. The series has received critical acclaim for its world-building, characters, and narrative.

==Plot synopsis==

&quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; takes place in a fictional world in which seasons last for years and end unpredictably. Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel, the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united under the Targaryen dynasty, establishing military supremacy through their control of dragons. The Targaryens ruled for three hundred years, continuing beyond the extinction of the dragons. Their dynasty eventually ended with a rebellion led by Lord Robert Baratheon, in which Aerys II &quot;the Mad King&quot; Targaryen was killed and Robert proclaimed king of the Seven Kingdoms. At the beginning of &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, 15 years have passed since Robert&#x27;s rebellion, with a nine-year-long summer coming to an end.

The principal story chronicles the power struggle for the Iron Throne among the great Houses of Westeros following the death of King Robert in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;. Robert&#x27;s heir apparent, the 13-year-old Joffrey, is immediately proclaimed king through the machinations of his mother, Queen Cersei Lannister. When Lord Eddard &quot;Ned&quot; Stark, Robert&#x27;s closest friend and chief advisor, discovers that Joffrey and his siblings are the product of incest between Cersei and her twin brother Ser Jaime Lannister, Eddard attempts to unseat Joffrey, but is betrayed and executed for treason. In response, Robert&#x27;s brothers Stannis and Renly lay separate claims to the throne. During this period of instability, two of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros attempt to become independent from the Iron Throne: Eddard&#x27;s eldest son Robb is proclaimed King in the North, while Lord Balon Greyjoy desires to recover the sovereignty of his region, the Iron Islands. The so-called &quot;War of the Five Kings&quot; is in full progress by the middle of the second book, &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;.

The second part of the story takes place in the far north of Westeros, where an 8,000-year-old wall of ice, simply called &quot;the Wall&quot;, defends the Seven Kingdoms from supernatural creatures known as the Others. The Wall&#x27;s sentinels, the Sworn Brotherhood of the Night&#x27;s Watch, also protect the realm from incursions by the &quot;wildlings&quot; or &quot;Free Folk&quot;, a number of human tribes living on the north side of the Wall. The Night&#x27;s Watch story is told primarily through the point of view of Jon Snow, Lord Eddard Stark&#x27;s bastard son. Jon follows in the footsteps of his uncle Benjen Stark and joins the Watch at a young age, rising quickly through the ranks. He eventually becomes Lord Commander of the Night&#x27;s Watch. In the third volume, &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;, the Night&#x27;s Watch storyline becomes increasingly entangled with the War of the Five Kings.

The third storyline follows Daenerys Targaryen, daughter of Aerys II, the last Targaryen king. On the continent of Essos, east of Westeros across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys is married off by her elder brother Viserys Targaryen to a powerful warlord but slowly becomes an independent and intelligent ruler in her own right. Her rise to power is aided by the historic birth of three dragons, hatched from eggs given to her as wedding gifts. The three dragons soon become not only a symbol of her bloodline and her claim to the throne but also devastating weapons of war, which help her in the conquest of Slaver&#x27;s Bay. The story follows her year-long conflict with the region&#x27;s city states, in which she aims to consolidate power, disrupt the Essosi slave trade, and gather support for her ambitions to reclaim Westeros.

==Publishing history==
===Overview===
Books in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series are first published in hardcover and are later re-released as paperback editions. In the UK, Harper Voyager publishes special slipcased editions. The series has also been translated into more than 30 languages. All page totals given below are for the US first editions.

===First three novels (1991–2000)===

George R. R. Martin was already a successful fantasy and sci-fi author and TV writer before writing his &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; book series. Martin had his first short story published in 1971 and his first novel in 1977. By the mid-1990s, he had won three Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and other awards for his short fiction. Although his early books were well-received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s. He worked principally on the revival of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; throughout 1986 and on &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes. This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising the size of his imagination. Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.

When Martin was between Hollywood projects in the summer of 1991, he started writing a new science fiction novel called &quot;Avalon&quot;. After three chapters, he had a vivid idea of a boy seeing a man&#x27;s beheading and finding direwolves in the snow, which would eventually become the first non-prologue chapter of &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;. Putting &quot;Avalon&quot; aside, Martin finished this chapter in a few days and grew certain that it was part of a longer story. After a few more chapters, Martin perceived his new book as a fantasy story and started making maps and genealogies. However, the writing of this book was interrupted for a few years when Martin returned to Hollywood to produce his TV series &quot;Doorways&quot; that ABC had ordered but ultimately never aired.

In 1994, Martin gave his agent, Kirby McCauley, the first 200 pages and a two-page story projection as part of a planned trilogy with the novels &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; and &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot; intended to follow. When Martin had still not reached the novel&#x27;s end at 1,400 manuscript pages, he felt that the series needed to be four and eventually six books long, which he imagined as two linked trilogies of one long story. Martin chose &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; as the overall series title: Martin saw the struggle of the cold Others and the fiery dragons as one possible meaning for &quot;Ice and Fire&quot;, whereas the word &quot;song&quot; had previously appeared in Martin&#x27;s book titles &quot;A Song for Lya&quot; and &quot;Songs the Dead Men Sing&quot;, stemming from his obsessions with songs. Martin also named Robert Frost&#x27;s 1920 poem &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; and cultural associations such as passion versus betrayal as possible influences for the series&#x27; title.

The revised finished manuscript for &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; was 1,088 pages long (without the appendices), with the publication following in August 1996. &quot;The Wheel of Time &quot;author Robert Jordan had written a short endorsement for the cover that was influential in ensuring the book&#x27;s and hence series&#x27; early success with fantasy readers. &quot;Blood of the Dragon&quot;, a pre-release sample novella drawn from Daenerys&#x27;s chapters, went on to win the 1997 Hugo Award for Best Novella. The first book was marketed as part of the &quot;&quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; trilogy&quot; in 1996, but by the second book&#x27;s release, the &quot;trilogy&quot; suffix had been dropped and the series was retitled to &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;.

The 300 pages removed from the &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; manuscript served as the opening of the second book, entitled &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;. It was released in February 1999 in the United States, with a manuscript length (without appendices) of 1,184 pages. &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; was the first book of the &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series to make the best-seller lists, reaching 13 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list in 1999. After the success of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films, Martin received his first inquiries to the rights of the &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series from various producers and filmmakers.

Martin was several months late turning in the third book, &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;. The last chapter he had written was about the &quot;Red Wedding&quot;, a pivotal scene notable for its violence (see Themes: Violence and death). &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; was 1,521 pages in manuscript (without appendices), causing problems for many of Martin&#x27;s publishers around the world. Bantam Books published &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; in a single volume in the United States in November 2000, whereas some other-language editions were divided into two, three, or even four volumes. &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; debuted at number 12 in the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list.

===Bridging the timeline gap (2000–2011) ===
After &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;, and &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;, Martin originally intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen&#x27;s return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons could grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;, Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;. A long prologue was to establish what had happened in the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.

In 2001, Martin was still optimistic that the fourth installment might be released in the last quarter of 2002. However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. On one hand, Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to have nothing happen for five years. After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book, which he called &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;. The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap. The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands. These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions complicated the plot for Martin.

The manuscript length of &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; eventually surpassed &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;. Martin was reluctant to make the necessary deep cuts to get the book down to publishable length, as that would have compromised the story he had in mind. Printing the book in &quot;microtype on onion skin paper and giving each reader a magnifying glass&quot; was also not an option for him. On the other hand, Martin rejected the publishers&#x27; idea of splitting the narrative chronologically into &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;, Parts One and Two. Being already late with the book, Martin had not even started writing all characters&#x27; stories, and also objected to ending the first book without any resolution for its many viewpoint characters as in previous books.

With the characters spread out across the world, a friend suggested that Martin divide the story geographically into two volumes, of which &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; would be the first. This approach would give Martin the room to complete his commenced story arcs as he had originally intended, which he still felt was the best approach years later. Martin moved the unfinished characters&#x27; stories set in the east (Essos) and north (Winterfell and the Wall) into the next book, &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, and left &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; to cover the events in King&#x27;s Landing, the Riverlands, Dorne, and the Iron Islands. Both books begin immediately after the end of &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;, running in parallel instead of sequentially, and involve different casts of characters with only little overlap. Martin split Arya&#x27;s chapters into both books after having already moved the three other most popular characters (Jon Snow, Tyrion, and Daenerys) into &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;.

Upon its release in October 2005 in the UK and November 2005 in the US, &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; went straight to the top of &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list. Among the positive reviewers was Lev Grossman of &quot;Time&quot;, who dubbed Martin &quot;the American Tolkien&quot;. However, fans and critics alike were disappointed with the story split that left the fates of several popular characters unresolved after &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;″ cliffhanger ending. With &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; said to be half-finished, Martin mentioned in the epilogue of &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; that the next volume would be released by the next year. However, planned release dates were repeatedly pushed back. Meanwhile, HBO acquired the rights to turn &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; into a fantasy drama series in 2007 and aired the first of ten episodes covering &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; in April 2011.

With around 1600 pages in manuscript length, &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; was eventually published in July 2011 after six years of writing, longer in page count and writing time than any of the preceding four novels. The story of &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; catches up with and goes beyond &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; around two-thirds into the book, but nevertheless covers less story than Martin had intended, omitting at least one planned large battle sequence and leaving several character threads ending in cliffhangers. Martin attributed the delay mainly to his untangling &quot;the Meereenese knot&quot;, which the interviewer understood as &quot;making the chronology and characters mesh up as various threads converged on [Daenerys]&quot;. Martin also acknowledged spending too much time on rewriting and perfecting the story, but soundly rejected the theories of some of his critics that he had lost interest in the series or would bide his time to make more money.

===Planned novels and future (2011–present)===
Martin believed in 2012 the last two volumes of the series will be large books of 1500 manuscript pages each. The sixth book will be called &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot;, taking the title of the last book of the originally planned trilogy. Displeased with the provisional title &quot;A Time for Wolves&quot; for the final volume, Martin ultimately announced &quot;A Dream of Spring&quot; as the title for the seventh book in 2006. Martin said in March 2012 that the final two novels will take readers farther north than any of the previous books, and that the Others will appear. Martin indicated he would not permit another writer to finish the book series.

====&quot;The Winds of Winter&quot;====

&quot;The Winds of Winter&quot; will resolve the cliffhangers from &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; early on and &quot;will open with the two big battles that [the fifth book] was building up to, the battle in the ice and the battle [...] of Slaver&#x27;s Bay. And then take it from there.&quot; By the middle of 2010, Martin had already finished five chapters of &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot; from the viewpoints of Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Arianne Martell, and Aeron Greyjoy, coming to around 100 completed pages. After the publication of &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; in 2011, Martin announced he would return to writing in January 2012. He spent the meantime on book tours, conventions, and continued working on his &quot;The World of Ice &amp; Fire&quot; companion guide and a new &quot;Tales of Dunk and Egg&quot; novella. In December 2011, Martin posted a chapter from &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot; from the viewpoint of Theon Greyjoy; several other chapters have been made public since. Four hundred pages of the sixth novel had been written , although Martin considered only 200 as &quot;really finished&quot;; the rest needed revising. During the Guadalajara International Book Fair in Mexico in early December 2016, Martin offered the following hint as to the tone of this book: &quot;There are a lot of dark chapters right now ... I&#x27;ve been telling you for 20 years that winter was coming. Winter is the time when things die, and cold and ice and darkness fill the world, so this is not going to be the happy feel-good that people may be hoping for. Some of the characters [are] in very dark places.&quot; Martin did not intend to separate the characters geographically again.

In 2011, Martin gave three years as a realistic estimate for finishing the sixth book at a good pace, but said ultimately the book &quot;will be done when it&#x27;s done&quot;, acknowledging that his publication estimates had been too optimistic in the past. In 2015 there were indications that the book would be published before the sixth season of the HBO show but in early January 2016 Martin confirmed that he had not met an end-of-year deadline that he had established with his publisher for release of the book before the sixth season. He also revealed there had been a previous deadline of October 2015 that he had considered achievable in May 2015, and that in September 2015 he had still considered the end-of-year deadline achievable. He further confirmed that some of the plot of the book might be revealed in the then-upcoming sixth season of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. In February 2016, Martin stated that he dropped all his editing projects except for &quot;Wild Cards&quot;, and that he would not be writing any teleplays, screenplays, short stories, introductions or forewords before delivering &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot;. In March 2020, Martin stated that he was writing &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot; every day, and in June he hoped to be done with it in 2021. In October 2022, Martin said that he had written approximately three quarters of the book.

====&quot;A Dream of Spring&quot;====
Martin is not firm about ending the series with the seventh novel. With his stated goal of telling the story from beginning to end, he will not truncate the story to fit into an arbitrary number of volumes. He knows the ending in broad strokes as well as the future of the main characters, and will finish the series with bittersweet elements where not everyone will live happily ever after. Martin hopes to write an ending similar to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; that he felt gave the story a satisfying depth and resonance. On the other hand, Martin noted the challenge to avoid a situation like the finale of the TV series &quot;Lost&quot;, which left some fans disappointed by deviating too far from their own theories and desires.

In 2012, Martin had acknowledged his concerns about &quot;A Dream of Spring&quot; not being completed by the time the TV series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; catches up in its storyline to the novels.

In 2015, Martin said that he was not writing &quot;A Dream of Spring&quot; together with &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot;, and in early 2016, he said he did not believe &quot;A Dream of Spring&quot; would be published before the last season of the HBO show.

During a question-and-answer session at the 2016 Guadalajara International Book Fair, Martin emphasized: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to tell you how I&#x27;m going to end my book, but I suspect the overall flavor is going to be as much bittersweet as it is happy.&quot;

In April 2018, Martin commented he had not started working on the book, and in November he said that after &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot; he would decide what to do next: &quot;A Dream of Spring&quot; or the second volume of &quot;Fire &amp; Blood&quot; or one or two stories for the &quot;Tales of Dunk and Egg&quot;.

In May 2019, Martin reiterated he had not started writing &quot;A Dream of Spring&quot; and would not do so before finishing &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot;.

====Other writings====
Regarding &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; as his masterpiece, Martin stated he would never write anything on this scale again and would only return to this fictional universe in the context of stand-alone novels. He prefers to write stories about characters from other &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; periods of history such as his &quot;Tales of Dunk and Egg&quot; project, instead of continuing the series directly. Martin said he would love to return to writing short stories, novellas, novelettes, and stand-alone novels from diverse genres such as science fiction, horror, fantasy, or even a murder mystery.

==Inspiration and writing==
===Genre===
George R. R. Martin believes the most profound influences to be the ones experienced in childhood. Having read H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, Robert A. Heinlein, Eric Frank Russell, Andre Norton, Isaac Asimov, Fritz Leiber, and Mervyn Peake in his youth, Martin never categorized these authors&#x27; literature into science fiction, fantasy, or horror and will write from any genre as a result. Martin classified &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; as &quot;epic fantasy&quot;, and specifically named Tad Williams&#x27; high fantasy epic &quot;Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn&quot; as very influential for the writing of the series. One of his favorite authors is Jack Vance, although Martin considered the series not particularly Vancean.

Martin experienced some harsh winters when living in Dubuque a few years in the 1970s, and suspects these winters had an influence on his writing; &quot;I think a lot of the stuff in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, the snow and ice and freezing, comes from my memories of Dubuque&quot;.

The medieval setting has been the traditional background for epic fantasy. However, where historical fiction leaves versed readers knowing the historical outcome, original characters may increase suspense and empathy for the readers. Yet Martin felt historical fiction, particularly when set during the Middle Ages, had an excitement, grittiness, and a realness to it that was absent in fantasy with a similar backdrop. Thus, he wanted to combine the realism of historical fiction with the magic appeal of the best fantasies, subduing magic in favor of battles and political intrigue. He also decided to avoid the conventional good versus evil setting typical for the genre, using the fight between Achilles and Hector in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, where no one stands out as either a hero or a villain, as an example of what he wants to achieve with his books.

Martin is widely credited with broadening the fantasy fiction genre for adult content. Writing for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Amber Taylor assessed the novels as hard fantasy with vulnerable characters to which readers become emotionally attached. CNN found in 2000 that Martin&#x27;s mature descriptions were &quot;far more frank than those found in the works of other fantasy authors&quot;, although Martin assessed the fantasy genre to have become rougher-edged a decade later and that some writers&#x27; work was going beyond the mature themes of his novels. Adam Roberts called Martin&#x27;s series the most successful and popular example of the emerging subgenre of grimdark fantasy.

===Writing process===

Setting out to write something on an epic scale, Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages in the very early stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time. In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later. However, with &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to finish . Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write. , Martin was still typing his fiction on an IBM PC compatible computer running MS-DOS with WordStar 4.0. He begins each day at 10 am with rewriting and polishing the previous day&#x27;s work, and may write all day or struggle to write anything. Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time. Martin does not consider &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; a &quot;series&quot; but a single story published in several volumes.

Martin set the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; story in a secondary world inspired by Tolkien&#x27;s writing. Unlike Tolkien, who created entire languages, mythologies, and histories for Middle-earth long before writing &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Martin usually starts with a rough sketch of an imaginary world that he improvises into a workable fictional setting along the way. He described his writing as coming from a subconscious level in &quot;almost a daydreaming process&quot;, and his stories, which have a mythic rather than a scientific core, draw from emotion instead of rationality. Martin employs maps and a cast list topping 60 pages in the fourth volume, but keeps most information in his mind. His imagined backstory remains subject to change until published, and only the novels count as canon. Martin does not intend to publish his private notes after the series is finished.

Martin drew much inspiration from actual history for the series, having several bookcases filled with medieval history for research and visiting historic European landmarks. For an American who speaks only English, the history of England proved the easiest source of medieval history for him, giving the series a British rather than a German or Spanish historic flavor. For example, Ned and Robb Stark resemble Richard, 3rd Duke of York, and his son Edward IV, and Queen Cersei resembles both Margaret of Anjou and Elizabeth Woodville. Martin immersed himself in many diverse medieval topics such as clothing, food, feasting, and tournaments to have the facts at hand if needed during writing. The series was in particular influenced by the Hundred Years&#x27; War, the Crusades, the Albigensian Crusade, and the Wars of the Roses, although Martin refrained from making any direct adaptations. Martin was also inspired by the French historical novels &quot;The Accursed Kings&quot; by Maurice Druon, which are about the French monarchy in the 13th and 14th centuries. Martin has also said that important events of the narrative are based on events in Scottish history such as the Black Dinner of 1440 and the Massacre of Glencoe in 1692.

Martin has also drawn from Roman history for inspiration, comparing Stannis Baratheon to the Roman Emperor Tiberius. Martin has sourced the Massacre of Glencoe and Black Dinner as inspiration for the &quot;Red Wedding&quot;, a crucial twist in &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;.

The story is written to follow principal landmarks with an ultimate destination, but leaves Martin room for improvisation. On occasion, improvised details significantly affected the planned story. By the fourth book, Martin kept more private notes than ever before to keep track of the many subplots, which became so detailed and sprawling by the fifth book as to be unwieldy. Martin&#x27;s editors, copy editors, and readers monitor for accidental mistakes, although some errors have slipped into publication. For instance, Martin has inconsistently referred to certain characters&#x27; eye colors, and has described a horse as being of one sex and then another.

===Narrative structure===


The books are divided into chapters, each one narrated in the third person limited through the eyes of a point of view character, an approach Martin learned himself as a young journalism student. Beginning with nine POV characters in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, the number of POV characters grows to a total of 31 in &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; (see table). The short-lived one-time POV characters are mostly restricted to the prologues and epilogues. David Orr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted the importance of &quot;the Starks (good guys), the Targaryens (at least one good guy, or girl), the Lannisters (conniving), the Greyjoys (mostly conniving), the Baratheons (mixed bag), the Tyrells (unclear), and the Martells (ditto), most of whom are feverishly endeavoring to advance their ambitions and ruin their enemies, preferably unto death&quot;. However, as &quot;Time&quot; Lev Grossman noted, readers &quot;experience the struggle for Westeros from all sides at once&quot;, such that &quot;every fight is both triumph and tragedy [...] and everybody is both hero and villain at the same time&quot;.

Modeled on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the story of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; begins with a tight focus on a small group (with everyone in Winterfell, except Daenerys) and then splits into separate stories. The storylines are to converge again, but finding the turning point in this complex series has been difficult for Martin and has slowed down his writing. Depending on the interview, Martin is said to have reached the turning point in &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, or to not quite have reached it yet in the books. The series&#x27; structure of multiple POVs and interwoven storylines was inspired by &quot;Wild Cards&quot;, a multi-authored shared universe book series edited by Martin since 1985. As the sole author, Martin begins each new book with an outline of the chapter order and may write a few successive chapters from a single character&#x27;s viewpoint instead of working chronologically. The chapters are later rearranged to optimize character intercutting, chronology, and suspense.

Influenced by his television and film scripting background, Martin tries to keep readers engrossed by ending each &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; chapter with a tense or revelational moment, a twist or a cliffhanger, similar to a TV act break. Scriptwriting has also taught him the technique of &quot;cutting out the fat and leaving the muscle&quot;, which is the final stage of completing a book, a technique that brought the page count in &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; down almost eighty pages. Dividing the continuous &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; story into books is much harder for Martin. Each book shall represent a phase of the journey that ends in closure for most characters. A smaller portion of characters is left with clear-cut cliffhangers to make sure readers come back for the next installment, although &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; had more cliffhangers than Martin originally intended. Both one-time and regular POV characters are designed to have full character arcs ending in tragedy or triumph, and are written to hold the readers&#x27; interest and not be skipped in reading. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not rely on the hero to come through unscathed and will instead feel the character&#x27;s fear with each page turn.

The unresolved larger narrative arc encourages speculation about future story events. According to Martin, much of the key to &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; future lies over a dozen years in the fictional past, of which each volume reveals more. Events planned from the beginning are foreshadowed, although Martin is careful not to make the story predictable. The viewpoint characters, who serve as unreliable narrators, may clarify or provide different perspectives on past events. Therefore, what the readers believe to be true may not necessarily be true.

===Character development===

Regarding the characters as the heart of the story, Martin planned the epic &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; to have a large cast of characters and many different settings from the beginning. &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; has a 63-page list of characters, with many of the thousands of characters mentioned only in passing or disappearing from view for long stretches. When Martin adds a new family to the ever-growing number of genealogies in the appendices, he devises a secret about the personality or fate of the family members. However, their backstory remains subject to change until written down in the story. Martin drew most character inspiration from history (without directly translating historical figures) and his own experiences, but also from the manners of his friends, acquaintances, and people of public interest. Martin aims to &quot;make my characters real and to make them human, characters who have good and bad, noble and selfish well-mixed in their natures&quot;. Jeff VanderMeer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; remarked that &quot;Martin&#x27;s devotion to fully inhabiting his characters, for better or worse, creates the unstoppable momentum in his novels and contains an implied criticism of Tolkien&#x27;s moral simplicity&quot; (see Themes: Moral ambiguity).

Martin deliberately ignored the writing rule of never giving two characters names starting with the same letter. Instead, character names reflect the naming systems in various European family histories, where particular names were associated with specific royal houses and where even the secondary families assigned the same names repeatedly. The story of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; therefore has children called &quot;Robert&quot; in honor of King Robert of House Baratheon, a &quot;Brandon&quot; in every other generation of the Starks in commemoration of Brandon the Builder (of the Wall), and the syllable &quot;Ty&quot; commonly occurring in given names of House Lannister. Confident that readers would pay attention, Martin distinguished people sharing a given name by adding numbers or locations to their given names (e.g. Henry V of England). The family names were designed in association with ethnic groups (see backstory): the First Men in the North of Westeros had very simply descriptive names like Stark and Strong, whereas the descendants of the Andal invaders in the South have more elaborate, undescriptive house names like Lannister or Arryn, and the Targaryens (being Valyrians from the Eastern continent), have the most exotic names with the letter Y.

All characters are designed to speak with their own internal voices to capture their views of the world. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; pondered whether Martin ultimately intended the readers to sympathize with characters on both sides of the Lannister–Stark feud long before plot developments force them to make their emotional choices. Contrary to most conventional epic fantasies, the characters of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; are vulnerable so that, according to &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, the reader &quot;cannot be sure that good shall triumph, which makes those instances where it does all the more exulting.&quot; Martin gets emotionally involved in the characters&#x27; lives during writing, which makes the chapters with dreadful events sometimes very difficult to write. Seeing the world through the characters&#x27; eyes requires a certain amount of empathy with them, including the villains, all of whom he has said he loves as if they were his own children. Martin found that some characters had minds of their own and took his writing in different directions. He returns to the intended story if it does not work out, but these detours sometimes prove more rewarding for him.

Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen generate the most feedback from readers. They are also four of the &quot;big six&quot; main characters of the series, according to Martin (the other two being Sansa Stark and Bran Stark). Martin has stated that Tyrion is his personal favorite, as the grayest of the gray characters, with his cunning and wit making him the most fun to write. Martin has also said that Bran Stark is the hardest character to write. As the character most deeply involved in magic, Bran&#x27;s story needs to be handled carefully within the supernatural aspects of the books. Bran is also the youngest viewpoint character, and has to deal with the series&#x27; adult themes like grief, loneliness, and anger. Martin set out to have the young characters grow up faster between chapters, but, as it was implausible for a character to take two months to respond, a finished book represents very little time passed. Martin hoped the planned five-year break would ease the situation and age the children to almost adults in terms of the Seven Kingdoms, but he later dropped the five-year gap (see section Bridging the timeline gap).

==Themes==

Modern fantasy may often embrace strangeness, but &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism. Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin&#x27;s eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.

Since Martin drew on historical sources to build the world of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, Damien G. Walter of &quot;The Guardian&quot; saw a strong resemblance between Westeros and England in the period of the Wars of the Roses. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; Adam Serwer regarded &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; as &quot;more a story of politics than one of heroism, a story about humanity wrestling with its baser obsessions than fulfilling its glorious potential&quot;, where the emergent power struggle stems from the feudal system&#x27;s repression and not from the fight between good and evil. Martin not only wanted to reflect the frictions of the medieval class structures in the novels, but also explore the consequences of the leaders&#x27; decisions, as general goodness does not automatically make competent leaders and vice versa.

A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin rejects for not mirroring the real world. Attracted to gray characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner&#x27;s view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about. Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.

Although fantasy comes from an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest necessity to reflect the real world where people, even beloved people, sometimes die ugly deaths. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras, or of orcs or their equivalents, have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend&#x27;s death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero&#x27;s sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.

According to Martin, the fantasy genre rarely focuses on sex and sexuality, instead often treating sexuality in a juvenile way or neglecting it completely. Martin, however, considers sexuality an important driving force in human life that should not be excluded from the narrative. Providing sensory detail for an immersive experience is more important than plot advancement for Martin, who aims to let the readers experience the novels&#x27; sex scenes, &quot;whether it&#x27;s a great transcendent, exciting, mind blowing sex, or whether it&#x27;s disturbing, twisted, dark sex, or disappointing perfunctory sex.&quot; Martin was fascinated by medieval contrasts where knights venerated their ladies with poems and wore their favors in tournaments while their armies mindlessly raped women in wartime. The non-existent concept of adolescence in the Middle Ages served as a model for Daenerys&#x27; sexual activity at the age of 13 in the books. The novels also allude to the incestuous practices in the Ptolemaic dynasty of Ancient Egypt to keep their bloodlines pure.

Martin provides a variety of female characters to explore the place of women in a patriarchal society. Writing all characters as human beings with the same basic needs, dreams, and influences, his female characters are to cover the same wide spectrum of human traits as the males.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Science Fiction Weekly&quot; stated in 2000 that &quot;few would dispute that Martin&#x27;s most monumental achievement to date has been the groundbreaking &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; historical fantasy series&quot;, for which reviews have been &quot;orders of magnitude better&quot; than for his previous works, as Martin described to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Weird Tales&quot; magazine described the series as a &quot;superb fantasy saga&quot; that &quot;raised Martin to a whole new level of success&quot;. Shortly before the release of &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; in 2011, Bill Sheehan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was sure that &quot;no work of fantasy has generated such anticipation since Harry Potter&#x27;s final duel with Voldemort&quot;, and Ethan Sacks of &quot;Daily News&quot; saw the series turning Martin into a darling of literary critics as well as mainstream readers, which was &quot;rare for a fantasy genre that&#x27;s often dismissed as garbage not fit to line the bottom of a dragon&#x27;s cage&quot;. Salon.com&#x27;s Andrew Leonard stated:

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; noted in 2000 that &quot;Martin may not rival Tolkien or Robert Jordan, but he ranks with such accomplished medievalists of fantasy as Poul Anderson and Gordon Dickson.&quot; After the fourth volume came out in 2005, &quot;Time&quot; Lev Grossman considered Martin a &quot;major force for evolution in fantasy&quot; and proclaimed him &quot;the American Tolkien&quot;, explaining that, although Martin was &quot;[not] the best known of America&#x27;s straight-up fantasy writers&quot; at the time and would &quot;never win a Pulitzer or a National Book Award ... his skill as a crafter of narrative exceeds that of almost any literary novelist writing today&quot;. As Grossman said in 2011, the phrase &quot;American Tolkien&quot; &quot;has stuck to [Martin], as it was meant to&quot;, being picked up by the media including &quot;The New York Times&quot; (&quot;He&#x27;s much better than that&quot;), the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; (&quot;an acclaim that borders on fantasy blasphemy&quot;), &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, and &quot;USA Today&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Martin one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, and &quot;USA Today&quot; named George R. R. Martin their Author of the Year 2011.

According to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; John Barber, Martin manages simultaneously to master and transcend the genre so that &quot;Critics applaud the depth of his characterizations and lack of cliché in books that are nonetheless replete with dwarves and dragons&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; gave favorable reviews to the first three &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; novels at their points of release, saying that &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; had &quot;superbly developed characters, accomplished prose and sheer bloody-mindedness&quot;, that &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; was &quot;notable particularly for the lived-in quality of [their fictional world and] for the comparatively modest role of magic&quot;, and that &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; was one &quot;of the more rewarding examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy&quot;. However, they found that &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; as the fourth installment &quot;sorely misses its other half. The slim pickings here are tasty, but in no way satisfying.&quot; Their review for &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; repeated points of criticism for the fourth volume, and said that, although &quot;The new volume has a similar feel to &quot;Feast&quot;&quot;, &quot;Martin keeps it fresh by focusing on popular characters [who were] notably absent from the previous book.&quot;

According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Martin&#x27;s brilliance in evoking atmosphere through description is an enduring hallmark of his fiction, the settings much more than just props on a painted stage&quot;, and the novels captivate readers with &quot;complex storylines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing, and the willingness to kill off even his major characters&quot;. CNN remarked that &quot;the story weaves through differing points of view in a skillful mix of observation, narration and well-crafted dialogue that illuminates both character and plot with fascinating style&quot;, and David Orr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found that &quot;All of his hundreds of characters have grace notes of history and personality that advance a plot line. Every town has an elaborately recalled series of triumphs and troubles.&quot; Salon.com&#x27;s Andrew Leonard &quot;couldn&#x27;t stop reading Martin because my desire to know what was going to happen combined with my absolute inability to guess what would happen and left me helpless before his sorcery. At the end, I felt shaken and exhausted.&quot; &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; advised reading the novels with an &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; encyclopedia at hand to &quot;catch all the layered, subtle hints and details that [Martin] leaves throughout his books. If you pay attention, you will be rewarded and questions will be answered.&quot;

Among the most critical voices were Sam Jordison and Michael Hann, both of &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Jordison detailed his misgivings about &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; in a 2009 review and summarized &quot;It&#x27;s daft. It&#x27;s unsophisticated. It&#x27;s cartoonish. And yet, I couldn&#x27;t stop reading ... Archaic absurdity aside, Martin&#x27;s writing is excellent. His dialogue is snappy and frequently funny. His descriptive prose is immediate and atmospheric, especially when it comes to building a sense of deliciously dark foreboding [of the long impending winter].&quot; Hann did not consider the novels to stand out from the general fantasy genre, despite Martin&#x27;s alterations to fantasy convention, although he rediscovered his childhood&#x27;s views:

===Sales===

The reported overall sales figures of the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series vary. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said in April 2011 (before the publication of &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;) that more than 15 million &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; books had been sold worldwide, a figure repeated by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; in July 2011. Reuters reported in September 2013 that the books including print, digital and audio versions have sold more than 24 million copies in North America. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported more than six million sold copies in North America by May 2011. &quot;USA Today&quot; reported 8.5 million copies in print and digital overall in July 2011, and over 12 million sold copies in print in December 2011. The series has been translated into more than 20 languages; &quot;USA Today&quot; reported the fifth book to be translated into over 40 languages. &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated that Martin was the 12th highest-earning author worldwide in 2011 at $15 million.

Martin&#x27;s publishers initially expected &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; to be a best-seller, but the first installment did not even reach any lower positions in the bestseller list. This left Martin unsurprised, as it is &quot;a fool&#x27;s game to think anything is going to be successful or to count on it&quot;. However, the book slowly won the passionate advocacy of independent booksellers and the book&#x27;s popularity grew by word of mouth. The series&#x27; popularity skyrocketed in subsequent volumes, with the second and third volumes making &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller lists in 1999 and 2000, respectively. The series gained Martin&#x27;s old writings new attention, and Martin&#x27;s American publisher Bantam Spectra was to reprint his out-of-print solo novels.

The fourth installment, &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;, was an immediate best-seller at its 2005 release, hitting number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; hardcover fiction bestseller list November 27, 2005, which for a fantasy novel suggested that Martin&#x27;s books were attracting mainstream readers. The paperback edition of &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; reached its 34th printing in 2010, surpassing the one million mark. Before it even premiered, the TV series had boosted sales of the book series, with &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; approaching triple-digit growth in year-on-year sales. Bantam was looking forward to seeing the tie-ins boost sales further, and Martin&#x27;s British publisher Harper Voyager expected readers to rediscover their other epic fantasy literature. With a reported 4.5 million copies of the first four volumes in print in early 2011, the four volumes re-appeared on the paperback fiction bestseller lists in the second quarter of 2011.

At its point of publication in July 2011, &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; was in its sixth print with more than 650,000 hardbacks in print. It also had the highest single and first-day sales of any new fiction title published in 2011 at that point, with 170,000 hardcovers, 110,000 e-books, and 18,000 audio books reportedly sold on the first day. &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; reached the top of &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list on July 31, 2011. Unlike most other big titles, the fifth volume sold more physical than digital copies early on, but nevertheless, Martin became the tenth author to sell 1 million Amazon Kindle e-books. All five volumes and the four-volume boxed set were among the top 100 best-selling books in the United States in 2011 and 2012.

The TV series has contributed significantly boosting sales of both the books and collectibles like box-sets, merchandise, and other items. The TV series also contributed to increasing the geographic coverage of the books, introducing new customers in emerging countries like India and Brazil to the book series. All this has significantly increased the overall book sales. As of April 2019, the book series has sold 90million copies worldwide.

===Fandom===

During the 1980s and early 1990s, Martin&#x27;s novels had slowly earned him a reputation in science fiction circles, although he said to only have received a few fans&#x27; letters a year in the pre-internet days. The publication of &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; caused Martin&#x27;s following to grow, with fan sites springing up and a Trekkie-like society of followers evolving that meet regularly. Westeros.org, one of the main &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; fansites with about seventeen thousand registered members , was co-founded in 1999 by a Swedish-based fan of Cuban descent, Elio M. García Jr., as well as Linda Antonsson, who introduced him to the series; their involvement with Martin&#x27;s work has now become semi-professional. The Brotherhood Without Banners, an unofficial fan club operating globally, was formed in 2001. Their founders and other longtime members are among Martin&#x27;s good friends.

Martin runs an official website and administers a lively blog with the assistance of Ty Franck. He also interacts with fandom by answering emails and letters, although he stated in 2005 that their sheer numbers might leave them unanswered for years. Since there are different types of conventions nowadays, he tends to go to three or four science-fiction conventions a year simply to go back to his roots and meet friends. He does not read message boards anymore, so that his writing will not be influenced by fans foreseeing twists and interpreting characters differently from what he intended.

While Martin calls the majority of his fans &quot;great&quot;, and enjoys interacting with them, he lost some of them because of the six years it took to release &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;. A movement of disaffected fans called GRRuMblers formed in 2009, creating sites such as &quot;Finish the Book, George&quot; and &quot;Is Winter Coming?&quot; When fans&#x27; vocal impatience for &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; peaked shortly after, Martin issued a statement called &quot;To My Detractors&quot; on his blog that received media attention. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that it was not uncommon for Martin to be mobbed at book signings. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called this &quot;an astonishing amount of effort to devote to denouncing the author of books one professes to love. Few contemporary authors can claim to have inspired such passion.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===

==Derived works==
===Novellas===
Martin has written several prequel novellas. The &quot;Tales of Dunk and Egg&quot; series, three novellas set 90 years before the events of the novel series, feature the adventures of Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire &quot;Egg&quot;, who later became King Aegon V Targaryen. The stories have no direct connection to the plot of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, although characters from it are mentioned in the series. The first installment, &quot;The Hedge Knight&quot;, was published in the 1998 anthology &quot;Legends&quot;. &quot;The Sworn Sword&quot; followed in 2003, published in &quot;Legends II&quot;. Both were later adapted into graphic novels. The third novella, &quot;The Mystery Knight&quot;, was first published in the 2010 anthology &quot;Warriors&quot; and in 2017 it was adapted as a graphic novel, as well. In 2015, the first three novellas were published as one illustrated collection, &quot;A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms&quot;.

The novella &quot;The Princess and the Queen, or, the Blacks and the Greens&quot; appeared in Tor Books&#x27;s 2013 anthology &quot;Dangerous Women&quot; and explains some of the Targaryen backstory two centuries before the events of the novels. &quot;The Rogue Prince, or, a King&#x27;s Brother&quot;, published in the 2014 anthology &quot;Rogues&quot;, is itself a prequel to the events of &quot;The Princess and the Queen&quot;. The novella &quot;The Sons of the Dragon&quot;, published in the 2017 anthology &quot;The Book of Swords&quot;, is the story of Aegon the Conqueror&#x27;s two sons Aenys I and Maegor I &quot;The Cruel&quot;. All three of these stories were incorporated as parts of &quot;Fire &amp; Blood&quot;, a book chronicling the history of the Targaryen line.

Chapter sets from the novels were also compiled into three novellas that were released between 1996 and 2003 by &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;Dragon&quot;:
* &quot;Blood of the Dragon&quot; (July 1996), taken from the Daenerys chapters in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;
* &quot;Path of the Dragon&quot; (December 2000), taken from the Daenerys chapters in &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;
* &quot;Arms of the Kraken&quot; (March 2003), based on the Iron Islands chapters from &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;

===&quot;Fire &amp; Blood&quot;===

&quot;Fire &amp; Blood&quot; is Martin&#x27;s complete history of House Targaryen, to be released in two volumes. The first volume was released on November 20, 2018.

===Television series===

With the popularity of the series growing, HBO optioned &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; for a television adaptation in 2007. A pilot episode was produced in late 2009, and a series commitment for nine further episodes was made in March 2010. The series, titled &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, premiered in April 2011 to great acclaim and ratings (see &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; § Reception). The network picked up the show for a second season covering &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; two days later. Shortly after the conclusion of the first season, the show received 13 Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series, winning Outstanding Main Title Design and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for Peter Dinklage&#x27;s portrayal of Tyrion Lannister. HBO announced a renewal for a third season in April 2012, ten days after the season 2 premiere. Due to the length of the corresponding book, the third season only covered roughly the first half of &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;.

Early during the development of the TV series, Martin told major plot points to producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. Martin was confident he would have published at least &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot; before the TV series overtook him. Nevertheless, there were general concerns about whether Martin would be able to stay ahead of the show. As a result, head writers Benioff and Weiss learned more future plot points from Martin in 2013 to help them set up the show&#x27;s new possible seasons. This included the end stories for all the core characters. Deviations from the books&#x27; storylines were considered, but a two-year hiatus to wait for new books was not an option for them (as the child actors continue to grow and the show&#x27;s popularity would wane).

Shortly after the season 3 premiere in March 2013, the network announced that &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; would be returning for a fourth season, which would cover the second half of &quot;A Storm of Swords &quot;along with the beginnings of &quot;A Feast for Crows &quot;and &quot;A Dance With Dragons&quot;. &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; was nominated for 15 Emmy Awards for season 3. Two days after the fourth season premiered in April 2014, HBO renewed &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; for a fifth and sixth season. Season 5 premiered on April 12, 2015, and set a Guinness World Records for winning the highest number of Emmy Awards for a series in a single season and year, winning 12 out of 24 nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series.
These episodes were watched by 8 million viewers, setting a record number for the series. On January 2, 2016, Martin confirmed that the sixth volume would not be published before the start of the sixth season of the HBO series. The sixth season premiered on April 24, 2016. These episodes received the most nominations for the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards with 23, winning 12, including the award for Outstanding Drama Series. The seventh season premiered on July 16, 2017. The eighth and final season premiered on April 14, 2019.

A spin-off prequel series, &quot;House of the Dragon&quot;, was later developed based on Martin&#x27;s &quot;Fire &amp; Blood&quot;. The first season premiered on August 21, 2022.

<text>The fictional world in which the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; novels by George R. R. Martin take place is divided into several continents, known collectively as The Known World.

Most of the story takes place on the continent of Westeros and in a large political entity known as the Seven Kingdoms. Those kingdoms are spread across nine regions: the North, the Iron Islands, the Riverlands, the Vale, the Westerlands, the Stormlands, the Reach, the Crownlands, and Dorne. A massive wall of ice and old magic separates the Seven Kingdoms from the largely unmapped area to the north. The vast continent of Essos is located east of Westeros, across the Narrow Sea. The closest foreign nations to Westeros are the Free Cities, a collection of nine independent city-states along the western edge of Essos. The lands along the southern coastline of Essos are called the Lands of the Summer Sea and include Slaver&#x27;s Bay and the ruins of Valyria. The latter is the former home of the ancestors of House Targaryen. To the south of Essos are the continents of Sothoryos and Ulthos, which in the narrative are largely unexplored.

The planet experiences erratic seasons of unpredictable duration that can last for many years. At the beginning of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, Westeros has enjoyed a decade-long summer, and many fear that an even longer and harsher winter will follow.

George R. R. Martin set the &quot;Ice and Fire&quot; story in an alternative world to Earth, a &quot;secondary world&quot;. Martin has also suggested that the world may be larger than the real world planet Earth. The &quot;Ice and Fire&quot; narrative is set in a post-magic world where people no longer believe in supernatural things such as the Others. Although the characters understand the natural aspects of their world, they do not know or understand its magical elements. Religion, though, has a significant role in the lives of people, and the characters practice many different religions.
==Maps==
&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, the first installment of the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series, has two maps of Westeros. Each new book has added one or two maps so that, as of &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, seven maps of the fictional world are available in the books. Martin said in 2003 that complete world maps were not made available so that readers may better identify with people of the real Middle Ages who were uneducated about distant places. He also did not &quot;subscribe to the theory put forth in &quot;The Tough Guide To Fantasyland&quot; ... that eventually the characters must visit every place shown on The Map.&quot; He conceded, however, that readers may be able to piece together a world map by the end of the series. He was intentionally vague about the size of the &quot;Ice and Fire&quot; world, omitting a scale on the maps to discourage prediction of travel lengths based on measured distances. A new map artist was used in &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; so that the maps are available in two versions by James Sinclair and Jeffrey L. Ward, depending on the book. The old maps were redone to match the style of the new ones.

A set of foldout maps was published on October 30, 2012, as &quot;The Lands of Ice and Fire&quot; (). The illustrator and cartographer Jonathan Roberts drew the maps, based on drafts by Martin. The twelve maps in the set are entitled &quot;The Known World&quot;, &quot;The West&quot;, &quot;Central Essos&quot;, &quot;The East&quot;, &quot;Westeros&quot;, &quot;Beyond The Wall&quot;, &quot;The Free Cities&quot;, &quot;Slaver&#x27;s Bay&quot;, &quot;The Dothraki Sea&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s Landing&quot;, &quot;Braavos&quot;, and &quot;Journeys&quot;. The latter tracks the paths taken by the novels&#x27; characters.

==Westeros ==

The story takes place primarily on an elongated continent called Westeros, which is roughly the size of South America. The continent is home to the Seven Kingdoms, also known as &quot;the Realm&quot; or the &quot;Sunset Kingdom&quot;, located to the south side of the Wall, a massive man-made ice wall (allegedly fused with magic) 700 feet in height and spanning east–west for 300 miles from coast to coast. The Seven Kingdoms are further divided into the so-called &quot;North&quot; and &quot;South&quot; by a swamp-rich isthmus called the Neck. The land north of the Wall still makes up a large chunk of Westeros (being roughly the size of Canada), but remains largely unmapped and unexplored, especially the ice field region north and west of a massive mountain range called the Frostfangs, which marks the farthest geographic limit of human settlements. The northern extent of the continent is therefore unknown, although thought to be continuous with a polar ice cap north of the Shivering Sea known as the White Waste.

At the novel&#x27;s beginning, the majority of Westeros is united under the rule of a single king, whose seat is the &quot;Iron Throne&quot; in the city of King&#x27;s Landing. The king has a large number of minor direct vassals in area known as the Crownlands, surrounding King&#x27;s Landing; while each of the other regions is functionally controlled by a different major noble house, who all wield significant power in their own lands, while owing fealty to the Iron Throne. Martin here drew inspiration from medieval European history, in particular the Hundred Years&#x27; War, the Crusades, the Albigensian Crusade, and the Wars of the Roses.

The first inhabitants of the continent were the Children of the Forest, a nature-worshipping Stone Age anthropoid species who carved the faces of their gods in weirwood trees. Some time later, Bronze Age human settlers, known as the First Men, migrated from Essos via a land bridge at the southeastern end of the continent and gradually spread to the entire continent. The First Men&#x27;s attempts to chop down forests and cultivate the land led to a millennia-long war with the Children of the Forest, that eventually was settled by an agreement known as &quot;The Pact&quot;. This was the beginning of the Age of Heroes, during which the First Men adopted the religion of the Children of the Forest. Those gods later became known in Westeros as the Old Gods.

Eight thousand years before the events of the novels, an enigmatic arctic humanoid species called the Others emerged from the Land of Always Winter, the northernmost part of Westeros, during the decades-long winter known as &quot;The Long Night&quot;. The Children of the Forest and the First Men allied to repel the Others, and then built the Wall barring passage from the far north. The region north of the Wall was since collectively known as the land &quot;Beyond the Wall&quot;, and settled by tribal descendants of the First Men known as the Wildlings or Free Folk.
Sometime later, the Iron Age humans from Essos called the Andals invaded Westeros, bringing along the Faith of the Seven. One by one, kingdoms of the First Men south of the Neck fell to the Andals, and only the North remained unconquered. The Children of the Forest were slaughtered and disappeared from Andal lands. Over time, seven relatively stable feudal kingdoms were forged across Westeros, although their territories fluctuated over the next few thousand years through constant warfare, and no kingdom remained dominant for long:
* The Kingdom of the North, ruled by House Stark of Winterfell
* The Kingdom of the Isles and the Rivers, ruled by House Hoare of Harrenhal
* The Kingdom of Mountain and Vale, ruled by House Arryn of the Eyrie
* The Kingdom of the Rock, ruled by House Lannister of Casterly Rock
* The Storm Kingdom, ruled by House Durrandon of Storm&#x27;s End
* The Kingdom of the Reach, ruled by House Gardener of Highgarden
* The Principality of Dorne, ruled by House Martell of Sunspear.

Three hundred years before the novels begin, the Targaryen dragonlord Aegon the Conqueror and his two sister-wives Visenya and Rhaenys, whose ancestors migrated from Valyria to Dragonstone a century prior, invaded the Westerosi mainland and landed his army at the mouth of the Blackwater Rush. The three assembled a temporary bastion called &quot;Aegonfort&quot;, which later grew into the massive capital city known as King&#x27;s Landing. Aided by their three formidable fire-breathing dragons, the Targaryen armies subdued six of the Seven Kingdoms through conquest or treaty, wiping out three of the seven ruling houses that refused to bend their knees, replacing house Durrandon with house Baratheon, house Gardener with house Tyrell, and house Hoare with houses Tully (in the Riverlands) and Greyjoy (on the Iron Islands). Only the defiant Dorne remained independent for almost another two hundred years through asymmetric guerrilla resistance, until it was finally absorbed under the Iron Throne through a marriage-alliance by King Daeron II in 187 AC. The Targaryens built the Iron Throne, forged from the swords of their defeated enemies by dragonfire. They also annexed the land regions of the riverlands and stormlands around the Blackwater Bay as the Crownlands. House Targaryen remained the ruling house of the Seven Kingdoms for almost three centuries until they were overthrown by a rebellion led by Robert Baratheon in 283 AC, who then became the first king of the Seven Kingdoms not of House Targaryen.

Martin took the name Westeros from the Scottish region Wester Ross.

The southern half of Westeros is based on an inverted map of Ireland.

===The North ===
The North consists of the northern half of the Seven Kingdoms and is ruled by House Stark from their castle at Winterfell. The North is sparsely populated, but nearly as big as the other six southern kingdoms combined. Martin compared the North to Scotland. The climate is cold overall, with hard winters and mild snows common regardless of the season. Beyond the wall in the far north, the climate is polar with heavy snow while further south, it is milder with more rain. The region&#x27;s northern border is the Gift, a stretch of land 50 leagues wide given to the possession of the Night&#x27;s Watch. However, due to Wildling raids it is filled with abandoned towns and farms.

An isthmus called The Neck separates the North from the South. It is dominated by swamplands and is home to short, marsh-dwelling crannogmen ruled by House Reed of Greywater Watch, loyal bannermen of House Stark. The Neck&#x27;s difficult wetland terrain is infested by predatory lizard-lions, restricting the only dryland passage to a causeway commanded by the almost impenetrable stronghold of Moat Cailin, which protected the North from land invasion from the south for thousands of years. The city of White Harbor, located at the mouth of the White Knife river, is a thriving port and the fifth largest settlement in the Seven Kingdoms.

Illegitimate children born of a noble parent and acknowledged by said parent in the North are given the surname Snow.

====Winterfell====

Winterfell is the ancestral castle of House Stark and the political capital of the North. Located at the geographical center of the North, it has a cold, subarctic climate with snowy winters and cool summers. The castle was built over a natural hot spring, whose scalding water runs inside the castle walls and warms its halls and rooms as well as the glass garden at its northwestern corner. There are several open pools where heated water collects within the godswood. The hot spring also prevents the ground from freezing. The castle has deep catacombs called &quot;the crypt&quot;, where bodies of deceased Starks are entombed behind statues in their likeness with a direwolf at their feet and their swords in their hands. The tombs have been used since the old kings of the North, known as the Kings of Winter, were in power. They ruled since before the arrival of the Andals.

To depict Winterfell, both the pilot and season 1 of the television adaptation used the 16th century clock tower and ancient courtyard of Castle Ward in County Down, Northern Ireland. Doune Castle in Stirling, Scotland, which was previously featured as Castle Anthrax in the film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, was also used for exterior scenes. Saintfield Estates stood in as Winterfell&#x27;s godswood, an enclosed wooded area where characters can worship the old gods beside trees with faces carved in their bark. A car park stood in for Winterfell&#x27;s courtyard, and a wine cellar was used to depict the Stark family crypt. Tollymore Forest featured prominently in the prologue of the pilot episode and in the pivotal scene where the Starks first find the direwolves. Cairncastle, meanwhile, served as the location where Ned Stark beheads the deserter Will. The interior of Winterfell, such as the Tower of the First Keep, the Great Hall, and Catelyn&#x27;s bedchamber, were filmed at The Paint Hall studio. Set designer Gemma Jackson said, &quot;Winterfell was based on a Scottish castle.&quot;

====The Wall====

The Wall is a huge structure of stone, ice, and magic on the northern border of the Seven Kingdoms. It is home to the Night&#x27;s Watch, a brotherhood sworn to protect the realms of men from the threats beyond the Wall.

The Wall was inspired by Martin&#x27;s visit to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, in the North of England close to the border with Scotland. Looking out over the hills, Martin wondered what a Roman centurion from the Mediterranean would feel, not knowing what threats might come from the north. This experience was so profound that a decade later, in 1991, he wanted to &quot;write a story about the people guarding the end of the world&quot;, and ultimately &quot;the things that come out of the [fictional] north are a good deal more terrifying than Scotsmen or Picts&quot;.

Martin adjusted the size, length, and magical nature of the Wall for genre demands; Jon Snow&#x27;s chapters describe it as approximately long and high in general, rising up to a perceived in spots due to huge foundation blocks. The top is wide enough for a dozen mounted knights to ride abreast (approximately 30 ft or 10 m), while the base is so thick that the Wall&#x27;s gates are more like tunnels through the ice.

The novels&#x27; legends claim that the First Men, or more specifically Brandon the Builder with the possible help of children of the forest and giants, constructed the Wall some 8,000 years before the events of the series.

The Wall has since been maintained by the Night&#x27;s Watch to guard the realms of men against threats from beyond, originally the Others, and later against wildling raids.

A strip of land known as &quot;the Gift&quot;, now stretching 50 leagues (about ) south of the wall, was given to them in perpetuity thousands of years earlier for cultivation. In &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, of the nineteen castles built along the wall, only three are still manned: Castle Black with 600 men, and the Shadow Tower and Eastwatch-by-the-Sea with 200 men each. Parts of Castle Black have fallen into ruin.

The TV series&#x27; Castle Black and the Wall were filmed in the abandoned Magheramorne Quarry near Belfast, Northern Ireland, whereas the scenes shot atop the wall were filmed inside Paint Hall Studios. The composite set (with both exteriors and interiors) consisted of a large section of Castle Black including the courtyard, the ravenry, the mess hall, and the barracks, and used the stone wall of the quarry as the basis for the ice wall that protects Westeros from the dangers that dwell beyond. They also made a functional elevator to lift the rangers to the top of the Wall. A castle with real rooms and a working elevator were built near a cliff high. &quot;Working construction lifts were discovered at a nearby work site and rise 18 feet; CGI fills in the rest to make the wall appear 700 feet high.&quot; The area around the elevator was painted white to make it look like ice. Martin was surprised by the height and thought: &quot;Oh I may have made the wall too big!&quot; Martin observed: &quot;It&#x27;s a pretty spectacular, yet miserable location. It is wet and rainy, and the mud is thick...[it] really gets the actors in the mood of being at the end of the world in all of this cold and damp and chill.&quot;

====Beyond the Wall====

&quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; takes the story to the lands Beyond the Wall, although the first five books do not explore &quot;what lies really north ... but we will in the last two books&quot;. The TV adaptation used Iceland as filming location for the lands Beyond the Wall. Martin, who has never been to Iceland, said Beyond the Wall was &quot;considerably larger than Iceland and the area closest to my Wall is densely forested, so in that sense it&#x27;s more like Canada Hudson Bay or the Canadian forests just north of Michigan. And then as you get further and further north, it changes. You get into tundra and ice fields and it becomes more of an arctic environment. You have plains on one side and a very high range of mountains on the other. Of course, once again this is fantasy, so my mountains are more like the Himalayas.&quot; In an HBO featurette, Martin stated the lands beyond the wall make up a big part of Westeros, being roughly the size of Canada. The Valley of Thenn is one such location beyond the Wall, and north of that is the Lands of Always Winter, where the Others come from.

During the first season, the HBO team used places that they could decorate with artificial snow for the north of the Wall, but a bigger landscape was chosen for Season 2. &quot;Primary filming for these scenes, which encompass both the Frostfangs and the Fist of the First Men, occurred at the Svínafellsjökull calving glacier in Skaftafell, Iceland, followed by shooting near Smyrlabjörg and Vík í Mýrdal on Höfðabrekkuheiði. Benioff said, &quot;We always knew we wanted something shatteringly beautiful and barren and brutal for this part of Jon&#x27;s journey, because he&#x27;s in the true North now. It&#x27;s all real. It&#x27;s all in camera. We&#x27;re not doing anything in postproduction to add mountains or snow or anything.&quot;

===The Iron Islands===
The Iron Islands are a group of seven islands to the west of Westeros – Pyke, Great Wyk, Old Wyk, Harlaw, Saltcliffe, Blacktyde, and Orkmont – in Ironman&#x27;s Bay off the west coast of the continent. Ruled by House Greyjoy of Pyke, the isles are described as bare and barren, with the local weather being &quot;windy and cold, and damp&quot;. The members of this seafaring nation are known in the rest of Westeros as Ironmen, and to themselves as Ironborn. Illegitimate children born in the Iron Islands are given the surname Pyke.

For fierce raids, the Ironmen are titled the &quot;terror of the seas&quot;. They worship the Drowned God, who &quot;had made them to reave and rape, to carve out kingdoms and write their names in fire and blood and song&quot;. The appendix of &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; summarizes that the Ironmen once ruled over the Riverlands and much of the western coast of Westeros. When Aegon the Conqueror extinguished Harren the Black&#x27;s line, he chose House Greyjoy as the new rulers of the Ironmen.

====Pyke====

Pyke is the seat of House Greyjoy. The television adaptation filmed the scenes of Pyke&#x27;s port at Lordsport Harbour in Ballintoy Harbour, in Northern Ireland&#x27;s County Antrim. The sea has worn away much of the rock on which Pyke originally stood, so the castle now consists mostly of a main keep on the main island and smaller towers perched on rocks surrounded by sea.

====Old Wyk====
Old Wyk is the smallest and holiest island in the Iron Islands. It is where Kingsmoots are held, and where the Grey King slew Nagga, a sea dragon, and made a court of his bones.

===The Riverlands===
The Riverlands are the populous and fertile areas surrounding the forks of the river Trident on Westeros. While they form one of the nine regions of Westeros, the Riverlands&#x27; central location and geographic features made the region an inter-kingdom battle zone that changed hands rather than becoming its own &#x27;eighth&#x27; kingdom of the Seven Kingdoms. Centrally located between the Westerlands, the Crownlands, the Vale, and the North and lacking the natural defenses of other regions, they have seen frequent warfare. The first ruler to unite the Riverlands was Benedict Justman, but the Justman dynasty died out three centuries later. The Durrandons conquered the Riverlands, but lost rule of it to Harwyn &quot;Hardhand&quot; Hoare, King of the Iron Islands. At the time of Aegon&#x27;s conquest, the Riverlands were ruled by Harwyn&#x27;s grandson, Harren the Black, king of the Iron Islands, and the Tullys were local nobles who rebelled against him by joining Aegon the Conqueror. As with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins, illegitimate children born in the Riverlands are given the surname Rivers.

====Harrenhal====
Harrenhal is an enormous ruined castle and is the site of many important events in the novels. Harrenhal was built by Harren the Black, after his conquest of the Riverlands, intending to make it the largest fortification ever built in Westeros. The castle has been described as so large that an entire army was needed to garrison it. The Great Hall had 35 hearths and seated thousands. Shortly after the castle was completed, Aegon the Conqueror&#x27;s dragon slew Harren, his sons, and his entire army by setting the castle alight.

Since then, the ruins of the castle have been occupied by a variety of houses, all of which eventually became extinct. As a result, the people of Westeros believe the castle is cursed. The logistical and economic difficulties inherent in keeping such an enormous castle maintained and garrisoned has made it something of a white elephant. At the start of the War of the Five Kings, the castle is in ruin, with only a fraction of it habitable, and held by Lady Shella Whent, the last of her House, who is stripped of Harrenhal when the Lannisters seize her castle. The castle changes hands repeatedly over the course of the novels, many of those holding it meeting unpleasant ends.

====Riverrun====
Riverrun is the ancestral stronghold of House Tully. The castle is located along one of the &quot;forks&quot; of the Trident and controls access to the interior of Westeros. The castle is bordered on two sides by the Tumblestone River and the Red Fork. The third side fronts on a massive manmade ditch. It was built by Ser Axel Tully on land he received from the Andal King Armistead Vance.

The castle is the location of Robb Stark&#x27;s great victory over House Lannister and the site of his crowning. By the end of &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;, Brynden Tully surrenders the castle to Jaime Lannister to spare further bloodshed. Riverrun then passed into the hands of Emmon Frey, an ally of House Lannister.

====The Twins====
The Twins is a large double castle straddling the Green Fork river; the two halves of the castle are connected by a bridge that is the only crossing of the river for hundreds of miles. The Twins is the seat of House Frey, which has grown wealthy by charging a toll of all those who cross for the past six centuries. Because the Freys are both wealthy and numerous, theirs is one of the most powerful houses sworn to House Tully. The castle&#x27;s strategic position gives House Frey enormous importance in times of war.

When Robb Stark goes to The Twins to repair his alliance with House Frey, the Freys massacre him, his mother, and his army (and in the TV adaptation, his wife): an event known as &quot;The Red Wedding&quot;, which violates native customs of guest right and incurs enmity throughout the Seven Kingdoms, especially in the Riverlands and North.

===The Vale of Arryn===

The Vale is the area surrounded almost completely by the Mountains of the Moon in the east of Westeros. The Vale is under the rulership of House Arryn, one of the oldest lines of Andal nobility and formerly Kings of Mountain and Vale. Their seat, the Eyrie, is a castle high in the mountains, small but considered unassailable. The only way to reach the Vale is by a mountain road teeming with animals called &#x27;shadowcats&#x27;, rock slides, and dangerous mountain clans. The mountain road ends at the Vale&#x27;s sole entrance, the Bloody Gate: a pair of twin watchtowers, connected by a covered bridge, on the rocky mountain slopes over a very narrow path. The protection of the surrounding mountains gives the Vale itself a temperate climate, fertile meadows, and woods. The snowmelt from the mountains and a constant waterfall that never freezes, named Alyssa&#x27;s Tears, provide plentiful water. The Vale has rich black soil, wide slow-moving rivers, and hundreds of small lakes. Illegitimate children born in the Vale are given the surname Stone.

====The Eyrie====

Based on the German castle of Neuschwanstein, the Eyrie is the seat of House Arryn. It is situated on the Giant&#x27;s Lance and reachable only by a narrow mule trail, guarded by the Gates of the Moon and three small castles, titled Stone, Snow, and Sky. Travelers must enter the Gates of the Moon and its upper bailey before reaching the narrow path up the mountain. The steps up the Giant&#x27;s Lance starts directly behind the Gates of the Moon. The Eyrie clings to the mountain and is six hundred feet above Sky. The last part of the climb to the Eyrie is something of a cross between a chimney and a stone ladder, which leads to the Eyrie&#x27;s cellar entrance.

The Eyrie is the smallest of the great castles in the story, consisting of seven slim towers bunched tightly together. It has no stables, kennels, or smithies, but the towers can house 500 men, and the granary can sustain a small household for a year or more. The Eyrie does not keep livestock on hand; all dairy produce, meats, fruits, vegetables, etc., must be brought from the Vale below. Its cellars hold six great winches with long iron chains to draw supplies and occasionally guests from below. Oxen are used to raise and lower them. Winter snows can make supplying the fortress impossible. The Eyrie&#x27;s dungeons, known as &quot;sky cells&quot;, are left open to the sky on one side and have sloping floors that put prisoners in danger of slipping or rolling off the edge. Executions in the Eyrie are carried out via the Moon Door, which opens from the high hall onto a 600-foot drop.

The Eyrie is made of pale stone and primarily decorated with the blue and white colors of House Arryn. Elegant details provide warmth and comfort through plentiful fireplaces, carpets, and luxurious fabrics. Many of the chambers have been described to be warm and comfortable, with magnificent views of the Vale, the Mountains of the Moon, or the waterfall. The Maiden&#x27;s Tower is the easternmost of the seven slender towers, so all the Vale can be seen from its windows and balconies. The apartments of the Lady of the Eyrie open over a small garden planted with blue flowers and ringed by white towers, containing grass and scattered statuary, with the central statue of a weeping woman believed to be Alyssa Arryn, around low, flowering shrubs. The lord&#x27;s chambers have doors of solid oak, and plush velvet curtains covering windows of small rhomboid panes of glass. The High Hall has a blue silk carpet leading to the carved weirwood thrones of the Lord and Lady Arryn. The floors and walls are of milk-white marble veined with blue. Daylight enters down through high narrow arched windows along the eastern wall, and there are some fifty high iron sconces where torches may be lit.

The Eyrie was held by Lord Jon Arryn, who fostered Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon prior to Robert&#x27;s Rebellion (also known as the War of the Usurper). After the war, Lord Arryn served as King Robert I Baratheon&#x27;s Hand of the King (prime minister). After Lord Arryn was assassinated, his wife, Lady Lysa Arryn, took her sickly child, Robert, and fled to the Eyrie. Lysa refused to align herself with any of the claimants during the War of the Five Kings, but eventually pretends to a possible alliance with House Lannister after Lord Petyr Baelish agrees to marry her. Later Baelish kills Lysa after she attempts to murder her niece, Sansa Stark. As of &quot;Feast for Crows&quot;, Baelish rules in the Eyrie as the Lord Protector and Regent for the sickly, epileptic Lord Robert &quot;Robin&quot; Arryn, and plans for Sansa to marry Harold Harding, who will become heir to the Eyrie and the Vale in the event of young Robin Arryn&#x27;s death.

For the CGI compositions of the Vale of Arryn in the TV series, as seen in the establishing shot of the Eyrie and from the sky cells, the visual effects team used images and textures from the Greek rock formations of Meteora. Initially they had been considering the Zhangjiajie Mountains in China, but because the landscape base plates were shot in Northern Ireland, using Meteora resulted in a better option. Set designer Gemma Jackson said, &quot;A lot of the mosaics in the Eyrie were based on a beautiful chapel I visited in Rome.&quot; The interior of the High Hall of the Arryns was filmed at The Paint Hall, occupying one of the four soundstages there. Martin acknowledged that the set differed significantly from its presentation in the books: &quot;In the books, the room is long and rectangular. But [The Paint Hall soundstage] had essentially a square space, which they chose to put a round hall in, with a staircase curving up to a throne that was high above.&quot;

===The Westerlands===
The Westerlands are the Westerosi lands to the west of the Riverlands and north of the Reach. They are ruled by House Lannister of Casterly Rock, formerly Kings of the Rock. People of this region are often called &quot;Westermen.&quot; Lannisport, lying hard by Casterly Rock, is the chief town of the region and one of the great ports and cities of Westeros. The Westerlands are rich in precious metals, mostly gold, which is the source of their wealth. Keeping with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins, illegitimate children born in the Westerlands are given the surname Hill.

====Casterly Rock====

A stronghold carved from a mountain overlooking the harbor city of Lannisport and the sea beyond, Casterly Rock is the ancestral seat of House Lannister. According to popular legend, the hero known as Lann the Clever tricked the Casterlys into giving up the Rock, and took it for himself. The Rock is renowned as the wealthiest region due to its abundance of gold deposits, and it is one of the strongest castles of the Seven Kingdoms as it&#x27;s a completely hollowed out mountain taller than even the Wall. It has never been taken in battle, despite attacks by the Iron Islanders and the plans of Robb Stark in the War of the Five Kings. It was held by Lord Tywin Lannister before the War of the Five Kings, but after his death, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister made one of her cousins castellan of the castle. As of &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, the narrative has not actually taken place in Casterly Rock, yet descriptions of it have been offered by the Lannisters in the POV chapters.

West of Casterly Rock is the coastal city of Lannisport. A busy port under the governance of the Lannisters of Casterly Rock, Lannisport thrives as a protected and wealthy city. The city is also home to many lesser Lannisters and other distant cousins with similar surnames, such as Lannys.

George R. R. Martin stated on his blog that he drew inspiration for Casterly Rock from the Rock of Gibraltar.

===The Reach===

The Reach is the southwestern region of Westeros along the valleys of the Mander (the largest river in Westeros) and the Honeywine. It is the second-largest of the kingdoms in terms of geographical area (behind only the North) and is the most fertile and heavily populated region of Westeros. The wealth and power of the Reach comes from its warm, sunny climate, which grants bountiful harvests of farm foods and the most sought-after wines. During times of war, the expansive lands of the Reach and its abundance of foods protects their inhabitants from initial famine and sickness. The Reach is considered the home of chivalry in Westeros, and is the place where knighthood is looked upon with the greatest reverence, and where the rules for tourneys are the most stringent and managed. The most prominent population center in the Reach is Oldtown, Westeros&#x27;s oldest and second largest city and port as well as the home to the Maesters&#x27; Citadel and the former religious seat of the Faith of the Seven, situated at the mouth of the Honeywine estuary.

The Reach was historically known as the Green Realm, ruled by King of the Reach from House Gardener in Highgarden. During Aegon&#x27;s conquest, the last Gardener King, Mern IX, was killed along with all his heirs and kins on the Field of Fire. House Tyrell, the stewards to House Gardener, surrendered Highgarden to Aegon and were rewarded with both the castle and the position of overlords of the Reach. Illegitimate children born in the Reach are given the surname Flowers.

During the reign of House Baratheon as the ruler of Westeros, the Reach is the second wealthiest region in the Seven Kingdom, behind only the mine-rich Westerlands. During the War of the Five Kings, in a significant political maneuver during the civil war, House Tyrell provides the starving populace of King&#x27;s Landing with hundreds of carts of food, ensuring the positive image of House Tyrell foremost, and the alliance for the Iron Throne with House Baratheon as secondary. However, the Tyrells were responsible for the starvation in the first place, as part of their plan to help the pretender Renly Baratheon contend for the Iron Throne.

====Oldtown====

Oldtown is one of the largest cities in Westeros and is by far the oldest, built by the First Men before the Andal Invasion. It survived the invasion by welcoming the Andals rather than resisting them. The city is located in the southwestern part of Westeros, at the mouth of the River Honeywine, where it opens onto Whispering Sound and the Sunset Sea beyond.

Oldtown is primarily known as the location of the Citadel, home of the order of Maesters who serve as councillors, doctors, scientists, and postmasters for the Seven Kingdoms. The city&#x27;s Starry Sept was the seat of the Faith of the Seven until the construction of the Great Sept of Baelor in King&#x27;s Landing. Aegon the Conqueror&#x27;s reign is dated from his entrance into the city of Oldtown and his acknowledgment as king by the High Septon.

Oldtown is the second most important port in the Seven Kingdoms after King&#x27;s Landing: trading ships from the Summer Islands, the Free Cities, the eastern cities, and the rest of Westeros constantly crowd into its harbors. The city itself is described as stunningly beautiful with a warm climate. Many rivers and canals crisscross its cobbled streets, and breathtaking stone mansions are common. The city lacks the squalor of King&#x27;s Landing, which usurped its position as the preeminent city of Westeros.

The largest structure in the city, and the tallest structure in Westeros, is the Hightower, a massive stepped lighthouse which extends some into the sky and is topped by a huge beacon which can be seen for many miles out to sea. Oldtown is ruled from the Hightower by House Hightower. Originally kings in their own right, they later swore fealty to the Gardeners of Highgarden, and became vassals of the Tyrells after the Conquest. The Hightowers are known for their loyalty and stalwartness. The current ruler of the city is Lord Leyton Hightower.

Oldtown remained aloof from the War of the Five Kings, but late in the war the Ironborn under King Euron Greyjoy launched a massive raid along the coast, conquering the Shield Islands and parts of the Arbor before trying to blockade the mouth of the Honeywine. An attempt to attack the city harbor was repulsed by the city&#x27;s defenders. Oldtown remains under threat from the Ironborn.

===The Stormlands===
The Stormlands are the large cape between the Blackwater Bay and the Sea of Dorne and the cape&#x27;s associated western hinterlands, named for the severe weathers in the coastal areas. The region is bordered in the east by the Narrow Sea, especially a large semi-enclosed bay known as the Shipbreaker Bay behind the island of Tarth; from King&#x27;s Landing and the Crownlands in the north by a large forest known as the Kingswood; from the Reach in the west by the headwaters of the Mander River; and Dorne in the south by the expansive Red Mountains. The southwestern Stormlands are a borderland area historically contested among the Stormlands, the Reach and Dorne, known as the Dornish Marches.

Before Aegon&#x27;s conquest, the Stormlands were ruled by the Storm Kings of House Durrandon founded by the legendary Durran Godsgrief. When Aegon the Conqueror invaded Westeros, his bastard half-brother Orys Baratheon slew the last Storm King in a duel and married the latter&#x27;s daughter to establish House Baratheon, which has ruled the Stormlands as lord paramount afterwards. Highborn illegitimate children born in the Stormlands are given the surname Storm.

====Storm&#x27;s End====
Storm&#x27;s End is the seat of House Baratheon and, before them, the ancestral seat of the Storm Kings extending back many thousands of years. According to legend, the first Storm King in the age of the First Men was Durran, who married Elenei, the daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind. In a rage her parents sent vast storms to shatter his keep and kill his wedding guests and family; whereupon Durran declared war against the gods and raised several castles over Shipbreaker Bay, each larger and more formidable than the last. Finally, the seventh castle stayed in place and resisted the storms. Some believe the Children of the Forest took a hand in its construction; others suggest that Brandon Stark, the builder of the Wall, advised Durran on its construction. The truth of the matter is unknown.

Storm&#x27;s End has never fallen to either siege or storm. Its outer defenses consist of a huge curtain wall, tall and thick on its thinnest side, nearly thick on its seaward side. The wall consists of a double course of stones with an inner core of sand and rubble. The wall is smooth and curving, the stones so well placed that the wind cannot enter. On the seaward side, there is a drop below the wall into the sea.

The castle itself consists of one huge drum tower crowned with formidable battlements, and so large that it can comfortably contain stables, barracks, armory and lord&#x27;s chambers in the same structure. Although never taken in battle, Storm&#x27;s End has endured several sieges and battles in recent history. The last Storm King, Argilac the Arrogant, abandoned his impressive defenses to meet the Targaryen commander, Orys Baratheon, in open battle during Aegon Targaryen&#x27;s War of Conquest, and lost. This led to Orys Baratheon marrying Argilac&#x27;s daughter and becoming Lord of Storm&#x27;s End.

During the War of the Usurper, Storm&#x27;s End was besieged for a year by the host of Lord Mace Tyrell, who commanded the landward forces, while Paxter Redwyne&#x27;s fleet of the Arbor kept the castle cut off by sea. Stannis Baratheon, commanding the defense, refused to yield and his men were reduced to eating rats. A smuggler named Davos ran the blockade to resupply the castle and Stannis rewarded him by knighting him and giving him lands, thus founding House Seaworth, but he also cut off the fingertips of his left hand as punishment for all his previous smuggling. After the war, Stannis was furious when his brother Robert, now king, gave the castle to their younger brother Renly and placed Stannis in command of Dragonstone. This led to many years of bitterness on Stannis&#x27; part.

During the War of the Five Kings, Storm&#x27;s End supported Renly when he attempted to usurp the crown, and was besieged by Stannis. When the castellan, Cortnay Penrose, refused to yield even after Renly&#x27;s death, he was killed by Stannis&#x27; ally, the priestess Melisandre, and the castle surrendered. Later, the castle was besieged by a strong army under Mace Tyrell, but he abandoned the siege after a few weeks to return to King&#x27;s Landing after the arrest of his daughter Margaery by the High Septon. As of &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, the castle remains in the hands of Stannis Baratheon.

At the end of &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; an army lands in the Stormlands led by Jon Connington and a young man claiming to be Aegon Targaryen, the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Elia Martell and heir to the Iron Throne. To attract support, Aegon plans to conquer Storm&#x27;s End and raise the banner of House Targaryen above the battlements.

In the TV adaptation, scenes in the Stormlands were filmed in Larrybane, Northern Ireland. The scene where Stannis&#x27; red priestess Melisandre gave birth to a shadow creature was filmed in the Cushendun Caves, also in Northern Ireland.

===The Crownlands===
The Crownlands are the lands in Westeros surrounding King&#x27;s Landing, ruled directly by the crown of the Iron Throne. The Targaryen kings consolidated this as one of the nine regions of Westeros, after their conquest of the Seven Kingdoms, from sparsely populated pieces of the Riverlands and Stormlands. The Crownlands form the entire coastline of Blackwater Bay, and include the original Targaryen homeland on the island of Dragonstone, at the Narrow Sea entrance to Blackwater Bay. Besides King&#x27;s Landing, which is the largest city in Westeros, the Crownlands include many towns and castles. The illegitimate children born in the Crownlands are given the surname Waters.

====Dragonstone====

Dragonstone was once the westernmost outpost of the ancient Freehold of Valyria. A century before the Doom, the Targaryen family moved to Dragonstone. When the Doom came upon Valyria, House Targaryen survived along with the last of the Valyrian dragons. Another century later, Aegon Targaryen and his sisters Rhaenys and Visenya launched a massive campaign of conquest from the island and eventually conquered all of Westeros except for Dorne, and North of the Wall. Aegon&#x27;s progeny reigned as kings of the Seven Kingdoms for centuries, Dragonstone being the seat of the heir apparent to the Iron Throne.

Dragonstone is a massive, forbidding fortress, taking up a large portion of the island of the same name. The castle is unique in that the builders and sorcerers of Valyria carved its towers and keeps into the shapes of dragons and made ferocious gargoyles to cover its walls using both magic and masonry. The castle&#x27;s lower levels are warmed by residual volcanic activity deep below the keep. There is a small port and town outside of the castle. Additionally, in a cave at the beachfront of the castle, huge deposits of Dragonglass can be found.

During the War of the Usurper, before the sack of King&#x27;s Landing, the Targaryen Queen Rhaella, who was pregnant, and her son Viserys were sent to Dragonstone along with part of the Targaryen fleet and a garrison of loyal soldiers. But after King&#x27;s Landing fell, Robert Baratheon dispatched his brother Stannis to take the island stronghold. After a storm destroyed the royalist fleet, the Targaryen garrison tried to betray Viserys and his newborn sister, Daenerys, to Stannis (the queen had died in childbirth). But Targaryen loyalists led by Ser Willem Darry took the children away. Stannis conquered Dragonstone easily, and King Robert granted him ownership of the castle. Stannis felt slighted because his younger brother Renly then inherited Storm&#x27;s End, the ancient seat of House Baratheon. Ser Axell Florent, one of the uncles of Stannis&#x27; wife Selyse Florent, acted as castellan.

Upon Robert&#x27;s death, Stannis declared himself king of the Seven Kingdoms and condemned the queen&#x27;s children as bastards born of incest, as he had discovered with Jon Arryn. Dragonstone became his main seat. He returned there after the disastrous Battle of the Blackwater. His councilor, the red priestess Melisandre of Asshai, tried to convince him to let her raise the &quot;stone dragon&quot; of the castle through blood magic, but Lord Davos Seaworth convinced Stannis to go north to the Wall to help the Night&#x27;s Watch instead. After Stannis abandoned Dragonstone, leaving the Bastard of Nightsong Rolland Storm as castellan, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister dispatched a fleet to barricade it. However, Ser Loras Tyrell, impatient to free the fleet to protect his home castle of Highgarden, attacked Dragonstone directly. He took the castle but lost a thousand men and was himself reportedly gravely wounded. As of &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, Dragonstone is now controlled by troops loyal to House Tyrell, and theoretically, once again under the control of the Iron Throne.

One scene set at Dragonstone, in which Stannis burns wooden sculptures of the Seven gods, was filmed at the beach of Downhill Strand. In Season 7 of the show, filming for Dragonstone took place at several locations in the Basque region of Spain: the islet of Gaztelugatxe in Bermeo, Itzurun Beach in Zumaia, and Muriola Beach in Barrika.

====King&#x27;s Landing====
King&#x27;s Landing is the royal capital of Westeros and the Seven Kingdoms. King&#x27;s Landing has an estimated population of half a million people, making it the most populous city in Westeros. It is situated on the Blackwater river on the spot where Aegon the Conqueror landed in Westeros to begin his conquest. The main city is surrounded by a wall, which is manned by the City Watch of King&#x27;s Landing, which is nicknamed the gold cloaks, after the cloaks they wear. Within the walls, the city&#x27;s natural landscape is dominated by three hills, named after Aegon and his two sister-wives Rhaenys and Visenya. Poorer smallfolk (commoners) build shanty settlements outside the city. King&#x27;s Landing is described as extremely populous but unsightly and dirty. The stench of the city&#x27;s waste can be smelled far beyond its walls and there is a vast divide between the city&#x27;s poor and the wealthy elite.

The royal castle, called the Red Keep, sits on Aegon&#x27;s Hill. It is the seat of the royal court. The Keep holds the Iron Throne. Aegon commissioned the throne&#x27;s construction from the swords of his defeated enemies. According to legend, he kept the blades sharp because he believed that no ruler should ever sit comfortably. Centuries later, kings still cut themselves on the throne. It is a common belief that one who cuts himself on the throne has been &quot;rejected&quot; by the throne and is therefore not fit to rule.

The city also holds the Great Sept of Baelor, where the Most Devout convene with the High Septon. It is the holiest sept of the Seven. Since the city was built in a rush, most of it is made of slums called Flea Bottom, where residents are so poor they regularly subsist on &quot;bowls of brown&quot;, a mystery stew that can include the meat of puppies and murder victims. King&#x27;s Landing has a temperate, mediterranean climate with long, warm, sunny summers and mild winters although snow does occasionally occur.

Martin compared King&#x27;s Landing to medieval Paris or London. It was inspired by the view of Staten Island from his childhood home in Bayonne, New Jersey.

The first season of the TV adaptation used Malta&#x27;s former capital Mdina to represent King&#x27;s Landing. &quot;Like King&#x27;s Landing, Mdina is a walled medieval city built upon a hill, but unlike King&#x27;s Landing, Mdina is an inland city so the production was limited to interior shots such as side streets and the town gate, which can be seen when Ned Stark arrives. Nearby Fort Manoel doubled as the great Sept of Baelor,&quot; which can be seen when Ned Stark is executed. Various other locations around Malta represent the Red Keep, &quot;including the real-life residence of the president of Malta, San Anton Palace. The gates of Fort Ricasoli doubled as the Red Keep&#x27;s gates; Fort St. Angelo was used for the scenes of Arya Stark chasing cats; and St. Dominic monastery stood in for the scene where Ned Stark confronts Cersei Lannister in the godswood.&quot;

&quot;In season two, filming for King&#x27;s Landing and the Red Keep shifted from Malta to the historic parts of Dubrovnik and the Minčeta, Bokar, and Lovrijenac fortresses in Croatia, which allowed for more exterior shots of an authentic walled medieval city.&quot; Parts of Season three were filmed there, too, as well as in nearby Trsteno. &quot;Known as &quot;the Pearl of the Adriatic&quot;, the city proved to share many characteristics with the fictional capital: it had a well-preserved medieval look, with high walls and the sea at its side. According to David Benioff, executive producer of the show, &quot;King&#x27;s Landing might be the single most important location in the entire show, and it has to look right&quot;, and &quot;The minute we started walking around the city walls we knew that was it. You read the descriptions in the book and you come to Dubrovnik and that&#x27;s what the actual city is. It has the sparkling sea, sun and beautiful architecture.&quot; Co-Executive Producer D.B. Weiss added &quot;To find a full-on, immaculately preserved medieval walled city that actually looks uncannily like King&#x27;s Landing where the bulk of our show is set, that was in and of itself such an amazing find&quot;. The Tourney of the Hand in season 1 was filmed in Shane&#x27;s Castle, Northern Ireland.

The Red Keep interior are filmed at Belfast&#x27;s studio The Paint Hall. Set designer Gemma Jackson said, &quot;When I was thinking about King&#x27;s Landing, the whole red aspect of it, that immediately made me think of Rajasthan. The floor [at King&#x27;s Landing] was from the Pantheon in Rome.&quot; Martin said that &quot;Our throne room is a spectacular throne room – we actually redressed a throne room built for [another] film. And again, it occupied a quarter of the Paint Hall, so it&#x27;s very big, but in my mind [in the books], it&#x27;s Westminster Abbey, it&#x27;s St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.&quot;

===Dorne===

Dorne is the southernmost and least populated land of Westeros. The capital, Sunspear, is the seat of the ruling House Martell. As of the first five books, Doran Nymeros Martell is the Prince of Dorne and Lord of Sunspear. Doran&#x27;s sister, Princess Elia, was married in a political alliance to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, the Prince of Dragonstone and heir to the Iron Throne. They had two children, a daughter, Rhaenys, and a son, Aegon. During the Sack of King&#x27;s Landing at the end of Robert&#x27;s Rebellion, Princess Elia was raped and murdered by Gregor Clegane, a House Lannister bannerman (vassal). Her children were also killed in front of her. Prince Doran and his wife, Princess Mellaria, have three children, Arianne, Quentyn and Trystane. During the War of the Five Kings, Tyrion Lannister, as Hand of the King, turns the historical enmity of House Martell and Dorne into an alliance by sending King Joffrey&#x27;s middle sibling and sister, Myrcella Baratheon, as the betrothed future bride to Trystane, the youngest child of Prince Doran, who is about her own age. The eldest child of Prince Doran, Arianne, is heir to House Martell, Sunspear and the rule of Dorne. The wealth of Dorne comes from their famous Sand Steeds, purebred horses of endurance, speed, and grace, and from spices, wines, fishing, fabrics, and textiles.

Dorne is bordered by the Sea of Dorne to the north, the islands known as the Stepstones to the east, and stretches from the high mountains of the Dornish marches, the Red Mountains, separating Dorne from the remainder of the Seven Kingdoms by land. The two major passes through the Red Mountains that connect Dorne with the rest of the continent are the Stone Way Pass and the Prince&#x27;s Pass. The Prince&#x27;s Pass leads to the Reach, while the Stone Way exits the mountains near Summerhall. The southern coast of the continent is bordered by the Summer Sea. Described as tropical in climate by George R. R. Martin, Dorne has the highest temperatures of any kingdom in Westeros, and is arid, with a rocky, mountainous, terrain that includes the only desert on the continent. Its rivers provide some fertile lands and during a long summer there is enough rain and other supplies of water to keep Dorne habitable. Inland water is almost as valuable as gold, and wells are jealously guarded. Notable locations of Dorne are Starfall, the seat of House Dayne, and Yronwood, the seat of House Yronwood, the most powerful of the Martell bannermen. Planky Town is a trade port town at the mouth of the River Greenblood.

Dornishmen have a reputation for hot-bloodedness. They differ both culturally and ethnically from other Westerosi due to the historical mass immigration of Rhoynish people. They have adopted many Rhoynish customs as well, including equal primogeniture. Dorne was the only kingdom in Westeros to successfully resist Aegon&#x27;s conquest, even killing one of his dragons during the war. It was conquered by Daeron I over a century after the Targaryen invasion, but rose against him leading to his death. Finally under Daeron&#x27;s cousin Daeron II they joined through marriage. This accomplishment has allowed Dorne to retain a measure of independence. Lords of the ruling House Martell still style themselves &quot;Prince&quot; and &quot;Princess&quot; in the Rhoynish fashion. Unlike most of the rest of Westeros, illegitimate children born in Dorne are treated nearly the same as legal offspring and given the surname Sand, as with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins.

According to &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;, &quot;There were three sorts of Dornishmen [...]. There were the salty Dornishmen who lived along the coasts, the sandy Dornishmen of the deserts and long river valleys, and the stony Dornishmen who made their fastnesses in the passes and heights of the Red Mountains. The salty Dornishmen had the most Rhoynish blood, the stony Dornishmen the least. All three sorts seemed well represented in Doran’s retinue. The salty Dornishmen were lithe and dark, with smooth olive skin and long black hair streaming in the wind. The sandy Dornishmen were even darker, their faces burned brown by the hot Dornish sun. They wound long bright scarfs around their helms to ward off sunstroke. The stony Dornishmen were biggest and fairest, sons of the Andals and the First Men, brownhaired or blond, with faces that freckled or burned in the sun instead of browning.&quot;

In the show, Dornish scenes were filmed in the Alcázar of Seville, Seville, Spain.

==Summer Sea==
=== Basilisk Isles ===
East of Naath, the Basilisk Isles have been a festering sore of the Summer Sea, and a safe haven for pirates, slavers, sellswords, and outlaws. Ruins have been found on the Isle of Tears, the Isle of Toads, and Ax Island. The Isle of Tears is the largest island, with steep valleys and black bogs. It was conquered by the Ghiscari and it was called Gorgai for two centuries, until the dragonlords of Valyria captured it and renamed it Gorgossos. It was used as a prison by the Freehold, a place where they sent their most despicable criminals.

=== Naath ===
Naath, also known as the Isle of Butterflies, is an island off the north-west coast of Sothoryos that lies west of the Basilisk Isles. The Naathi people have dark skin and golden eyes. They practice extreme pacifism, making music instead of war and refusing to eat meat, only fruit. This makes them especially vulnerable to slavers from Essos. Daenerys&#x27; interpreter Missandei is from Naath.

=== Summer Islands ===
As indicated on a map in &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;, the Summer Islands are a group of tropical islands situated to the south of Westeros, with a local fauna of talking birds, apes, and monkeys. The novels describe the island natives as dark-skinned people who speak their own language. They wear colored feathery clothes and live on fruit and fish. From their port city named Tall Trees Town, the Summer Isles export rare goods to Westeros such as wine, spices, feathers, but also a special kind of wood from which bows are made that have a longer range than most others. People of the Seven Kingdoms call the Summer Islanders&#x27; great vessels &quot;swan ships&quot;, &quot;for their billowing white sails and for their figureheads, most of which depicted birds&quot;. Samwell Tarly, who spends two chapters in &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; aboard a swan ship, describes the Summer Islander women as wanton, and their gods as strange; they &quot;revered the elderly and celebrated their dead&quot; through sexual intercourse. As a prostitute explains to Tyrion in &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;, the Summer Islanders regard their sexuality as the gods&#x27; gift to worship them through mating, and hence many of their highborn youths and maidens serve in pleasure houses for a few years to honor the gods.

==Essos==
Part of the narrative in &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; lies across the Narrow Sea from Westeros, an area comprising the large eastern continent named Essos. Being roughly the size of Eurasia, Essos has geography and climate that vary greatly. The western coastline is characterized by green rolling hills, the massive Forest of Qohor, and extensive island chains such as Braavos and Lys. The middle of the continent is covered by the flat grasslands of the Dothraki Sea and the arid lands known as the Red Waste to the east. Beyond the Red Waste lies the city of Qarth. The south is dominated by dry rolling hills and has a Mediterranean climate, with a coastline along the Summer Sea and Slaver&#x27;s Bay. The north coast of the mainland is separated from the polar cap by the Shivering Sea. To the south, across the Summer Sea, lies the uncharted jungle continent of Sothoryos.
Much of the fictional history of Essos relates to Valyria, a city located on a peninsula in southern Essos and the origin of House Targaryen before the destruction of the Valyrian Empire in an unspecified cataclysm. After the destruction of Valyria, the cities of Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen regained independence and ruled their respective areas as city-states. The area is known in the books as Slaver&#x27;s Bay.

===Free Cities and vicinity ===
Across the Narrow sea on the western side of Essos lie the nine Free Cities, independent city-states that are mostly on islands or along the coast. They are Lys, Myr, Pentos, Braavos, Lorath, Norvos, Qohor, Volantis and Tyrosh. Although most Free Cities are named early in the first novel, the books only provide a map of this region in &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;. Mountains to the east separate the coast from the plains of the Dothraki Sea, though gaps in the mountain range provide the Dothraki people some access to the Free Cities. The Free Cities were colonies built by the ancient Valyrian Freehold, and later declared independence after the Doom of Valyria. An exception to this is Braavos, which was founded by refugees fleeing Valyrian expansion, escaped slaves and other rabble. The languages of the Free Cities are derivatives of High Valyrian.

The Free Cities span an area characterized by the river Rhoyne, which the local character Yandry describes as &quot;the greatest river in the world&quot;. Its banks are the homeland of the Rhoynar, who worship the river as &quot;Mother Rhoyne&quot;. As mapped in &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, the Rhoyne originates from the conjunction of two of its tributaries, the Upper Rhoyne and the Little Rhoyne, southeast of the ruins of Ghoyan Drohe. The headwaters of the Upper Rhoyne lie in Andalos, the homeland of the Andals between Braavos and Pentos. The Rhoyne&#x27;s course runs southeast to turn due south after Dagger Lake, where river pirates hide on and around the many lake islands. The Rhoyne gains in width considerably as it gets fed by more tributaries, until it opens into the Summer Sea in a delta near the Free City of Volantis.

====Braavos====
Unique among the Free Cities, Braavos was not a Valyrian colony, but a secret refuge from Valyrian expansion. It is a city spread over hundreds of tiny islands in a lagoon on the northwestern end of Essos, where the Narrow Sea and Shivering Sea meet. Braavos is home to the &#x27;Iron Bank&#x27;, one of the wealthiest banks in the known world. Braavos is also known for its swordsmen known as &#x27;bravos&#x27;, and its mysterious assassins, the Faceless Men. It is also famed for the Titan of Braavos, both a fortress and a statue. The ruler of Braavos is known as the Sealord and it is from the sea that the city&#x27;s power and wealth flows. The hulls of Braavosi ships are painted purple and their merchant ships sail to many distant lands and bring their trade and wealth back home. Braavos has many moneylenders and the Iron Bank of Braavos lends money to foreign nations, especially The Crown, which has borrowed millions.

Braavosi dress in flashy colors while the very rich and powerful dress in black and in blues that are almost black. Officials of Braavos, called keyholders and justiciars, wear drab coats of brown or grey. The city is also renowned worldwide for its courtesans. Every courtesan has her own barge and servants to work them. The beauty of famed courtesans has inspired many a song. They are showered with gifts from goldsmiths and craftsmen beg for their custom. Nobility and rich merchants pay the courtesans large amounts of money to appear alongside them at events, and bravos are known to kill each other in their names. The character Syrio Forel, former first sword of the Sealord of Braavos, introduces Arya Stark to a unique form of Braavosi sword fighting, called Water Dancing. The style is a refined form of fencing in which the practitioner stands sideways and wields a slender blade. Pugnacious bravos fill the city, frequently dueling to display their skill.

Braavos was inspired by Venice, Italy. It was filmed in Croatian towns of Šibenik, and Kaštel Gomilica In the TV series, locations used as Braavos included the Croatian town of Šibenik and the Spanish town of Girona.

====Pentos====

Pentos is a major trading port on a bay of the western coast. Dominated by an architecture of square brick towers, it is headed by a Prince who is chosen by the de facto rulers of the city, known as Magisters. Khalasars occasionally make their way this far from the Dothraki Sea, but the Pentoshi are spared much of the raiding and invasions by paying tribute to their khals. Men from Pentos wear dyed and forked beards. Unlike in most other Free Cities, slavery is outlawed and Pentos is forbidden from participating in the slave trade due to terms set by the victorious Braavosi in a past war. However, Pentos only heeds these terms on a surface level: servants of the wealthy and powerful are still treated as slaves, collared in bronze and branded without the financial means of refusing their masters, and influential Pentoshi figures such as Magister Illyrio Mopatis still deal covertly in the slave trade.

In the television adaptation, Daenerys&#x27;s scenes in the pilot episode were filmed in Morocco. The production redressed and repainted the Jerusalem sets of &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; near Ouarzazate, Morocco, to serve as the courtyard of Illyrio&#x27;s mansion where Daenerys first meets Khal Drogo. When the pilot was delivered, HBO scrapped all of the footage shot in Morocco, and the Pentos scenes were re-shot in Malta. The exterior scenes at Illyrio&#x27;s mansion in Pentos were shot at Verdala Palace, the 16th century summer palace of the president of Malta. The Azure Window, on the island of Gozo in Malta, was used for the location of Daenerys&#x27;s wedding to Khal Drogo.

When Pentos reappeared in Season 5, it was filmed in Croatia.

====Volantis====
Volantis is a port on the southern coast of Essos, and is the oldest and proudest of the Free Cities. A fortification known as the Black Wall protects the oldest parts of the city. The Black Wall is inhabited entirely by the wealthiest citizens who can claim unbroken descent from Old Valyria. The city is ruled by three triarchs, who are elected every year by free landholders of Volantis, and defended by slave soldiers called the &quot;Tiger cloaks&quot;. Volantis is incredibly important to the slave market, and in the city there are five slaves to every free man. All Volantene slaves have facial tattoos denoting their profession: for instance, sex slaves have tears tattooed on their faces, and the tiger cloaks have tiger stripes. The worship of R&#x27;hllor is the most influential religion of Volantis, especially among slaves.

The TV adaptation used locations in Córdoba, Spain.

====Other Free Cities ====
* Lorath is a port city on a group of northern islands. It is the most isolated and financially the weakest. The character Jaqen H&#x27;ghar poses as a Lorathi in &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;, wearing long hair dyed red on one side and white on the other.
* Lys sits astride a series of southern islands. Unlike most inhabitants of the Free Cities the Lysene are homogenously Valyrian and thus have fair skin, hair, and eyes similar to the Targaryens. Lys is well known for its pleasure houses, training slaves in the arts of love and selling them as concubines and bed-slaves. Lys also frequently fights over control of the Stepstones and the Disputed Lands. There appears to be a love goddess whose worship is peculiar to Lys. Dany&#x27;s handmaiden Doreah and the pirate Salladhor Saan are Lysene.
* Myr is a coastal city renowned for their master lenscrafters, intricate lace, and fine carpets. Similar to the Dornish the Myrmen are descended from Rhoynar and possess dark eyes and olive skin. Myrmen are also similar to Norvosi and Pentoshi in that they are ruled by magisters that are known to pay tribute to passing Dothraki khalasars. Myr is a hub of trade in both slaves and their signature green nectar wines. Myr frequently fights over control of the Disputed Lands.
* Norvos sits on the main continent in two parts, one atop a high hill and the other beside a low river. The city has three large bells, each with its own name and distinctive voice, that are rung frequently. The surrounding area is a land of rolling hills, terraced farms, and white-stucco villages. The climate is fairly mild. Norvosi can be recognized by their dyed and upswept mustaches. The city is run by a council of magisters that are known to pay tribute to passing Dothraki khalasars. It is also home to a group of bearded priests that train elite guardsmen. These guardsmen swear oaths of duty and consider themselves wedded to their distinctive long axes.
* Qohor is situated on the main continent, in the vast Forest of Qohor. It is known for its fine tapestries and its smiths, who have the rare ability to reforge Valyrian steel, even directly infusing the metal with a variety of different colors. The Black Goat is a prominent god in the city. Qohor&#x27;s city guard has been composed solely of Unsullied eunuch slave soldiers ever since the Battle of the Three Thousand, when 3,000 Unsullied soldiers successfully defended the city against over 25,000 Dothraki horsemen. Guardsmen tie braids of human hair to their spears to commemorate the Dothraki cutting their braids in salute to Qohor&#x27;s defenders.
* Tyrosh, a coastal city-state ruled by an Archon, is infamous for its avarice. Traders deal extensively in slaves, Tyroshi pear brandy and dyes of many colors. The city features an abundance of pleasure houses, but they are not as highly regarded as those in Lys. Tyroshi master armorsmiths make intricate armor in fantastic shapes. Tyrosh is a popular center for the hiring of sellswords. The city is often drawn into the ongoing conflicts over the Disputed Lands and the Stepstones. The Tyroshi often wear forked beards and pointed mustaches dyed in bright colors. The character Daario Naharis is from Tyrosh.

===Central Essos===
This section covers the Essos locations east of the Free Cities that Daenerys Targaryen passes through on her travels in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; and &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; before moving on to Slaver&#x27;s Bay.

====Valyria====
Valyria is a peninsula in South-Central Essos, west of Slaver&#x27;s Bay. Before the Doom of Valyria, it was the seat of the Valyrian Freehold, a massive empire thousands of years old. The Valyrians are characterized by their silver hair and violet eyes. Valyria was called the Freehold because every man who owned land was allowed to vote for their leaders. The Valyrians also used slaves to mine the Fourteen Flames, a series of volcanoes rich with ore. They subjugated the Ghiscari and the Rhoynar and established all of the Free Cities, save Braavos. They did this through their knowledge of dragonlore. Twoscore noble dynasties, known as dragonlords, rode and controlled dragons. Eventually, an event known as the Doom of Valyria, apparently involving a violent eruption of the Fourteen Flames, destroyed the Freehold and made Valyria an archipelago in the newly-formed Smoking Sea. The Targaryens are descendants of Old Valyria who escaped after Daenys the Dreamer&#x27;s dream foretold of the eruption. The other noble families of Valyria mocked them, believing Daenys to be mad. Her father, Aenar Targaryen, believed her and successfully relocated the family to Dragonstone, an island on the east coast of Westeros, making them the only surviving dragonlords after the Doom.

====Dothraki Sea ====
The Dothraki Sea is a vast, flat grassland on Essos. It is inhabited by the Dothraki people, a copper-skinned race of warlike nomads with their own language and unique culture. The Dothraki live in hordes called khalasars, each led by a chief called a khal. Khalasars are broken into groups, called khas, which are each led by one of the khal&#x27;s captains, called kos. Each khal and his khalasar owe fealty to a ruling council of royal priestesses, called the dosh khaleen, whose members are each a former khal&#x27;s consort, called a khaleesi during the reign of her husband, one who became part of the dosh khaleen following his death.

Dothraki are expert riders and their horses are of prime importance in their culture, used for food, transportation, raw materials, warfare, and establishing social standing. They regularly raid other peoples.

George R. R. Martin said &quot;The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures ... Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also Alans, Sioux, Cheyenne, and various other Amerindian tribes ... seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy. So any resemblance to Arabs or Turks is coincidental. Well, except to the extent that the [historic] Turks were also originally horsemen of the steppes, not unlike the Alans, Huns, and the rest.&quot; He also noted that &quot;In general, though, while I do draw inspiration from history, I try to avoid direct one-for-one transplants, [so] it would not be correct to say that the Dothraki are Mongols.&quot; There are several similarities with another group of fearsome, nomadic warriors – the Scythians.

The Dothraki have only one permanent city, called Vaes Dothrak, which serves as their capital. The Dosh Khaleen hold the city as their seat. It is filled with statues stolen from other cities the Dothraki conquered or raided. There is a law that no Dothraki may shed blood within the boundaries of Vaes Dothrak and that those who do are cursed. Two gigantic bronze stallions, whose hooves meet midair, form an arch above the entryway to the city. For the first season of the TV adaptation, Sandy Brae in the Mourne Mountains of Northern Ireland was chosen to stand in for Vaes Dothrak. The bronze stallions making up the Horse Gate as the main entrance of Vaes Dothrak, were later added using CGI on two pedestals erected on location.

====Lhazar====
Lhazar is an area of the semi-arid lands south of the Dothraki Sea. A region of pastures and hills, it is inhabited by the Lhazareen, a peaceful people with bronze skin, flat faces, and almond eyes. They are predominantly shepherds, called the Lamb Men by the Dothraki, who frequently prey on them. They worship a god called the Great Shepherd and believe that all of humanity is part of a single flock. The scenes at the village of the Lamb Men that is sacked by the Dothraki were filmed in Malta, at the farming town of Manikata.

===Slaver&#x27;s Bay ===
Slaver&#x27;s Bay is a marginal sea of the Summer Sea, lying to the south of the Dothraki Sea, to the west of Lhazar and thousands of leagues to the east of the Free Cities. The climate is very hot. After a first mention in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; in relation to slavery, Daenerys Targaryen conquers the three great Slaver&#x27;s Bay port city-states Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen in &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;. She stays in Meereen throughout most of &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;.

The cities were built from the rubble of Old Ghis, an ancient rival of Valyria that was crushed by Valyria thousands of years before the series&#x27; events. The economies of the cities are largely based on slave labor and the slave trade. Treatment of slaves is often harsh, while citizens live in relative luxury. Professional soldiers of all three cities wear outlandish costumes and hairstyles that limit their usefulness in battle. The cities&#x27; militaries are highly dependent on additional slave and mercenary armies for the actual fighting.

Present inhabitants of the bay are a mixed race that no longer speak the old Ghiscari tongue but variations of High Valyrian with a characteristic growl. The ancient folk of Ghis, who name themselves the harpy&#x27;s sons in Astapor, are said to have bristly red-black hair. The Good Masters of Astapor all appear alike to Daenerys as &quot;thick fleshy men with amber skin, broad noses, dark eyes. Their wiry hair was black or a dark red, or that queer mixture of red and black that was peculiar to Ghiscari&quot;. Only the freeborn men of Astapor are permitted to wear garments called tokars, whose fringes display their status. Many Astapori women veil their face for the dust. The Astapori are drenched in sweet perfumes.

====Astapor====
The oldest city in Slaver&#x27;s Bay. Astapor lies on the banks of the Worm River, a wide, slow, and crooked stream with wooded islands. Entering Astapor at the beginning of &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;, Daenerys experiences it as an ancient and dilapidated city that has long passed its glory days. The city is dominated by its red brick architecture, and Arstan Whitebeard explains to Daenerys that the saying &quot;Brick and blood built Astapor, ... and brick and blood her people&quot; refers to the slaves who make the bricks. Astapor&#x27;s stepped pyramids, its fighting pits, streets, the surrounding walls and the Plaza of Pride are all made of red bricks. The so-called Plaza of Punishment at Astapor&#x27;s main gates is even larger than the Plaza of Pride.

The Plaza of Pride, which has a red-brick fountain and a huge bronze harpy statue in its center, serves as an open air slave market and a marshaling area for the Unsullied, elite eunuch spearmen known for discipline and effectiveness. Astapor is the only city to sell Unsullied, but also sells bed slaves, fieldhands, scribes, craftsmen, and tutors. The Unsullied require a huge investment in both time and money by the Astapori who raise and train them, but they earn the most profitable of returns for the Good Masters of Astapor. The Unsullied wear spiked bronze hats, and they obey at all costs, even if it demands their death. They are given new slave names each day to be reminded of their worthlessness. In times of attack, unsold Unsullied are deployed to the massive, crumbling red-brick walls that the Astapori no longer man.

Daenerys decides to buy all of Astapor&#x27;s trained and untrained Unsullied, over 8600 in number, and tells them to kill all adult Astapori slavers and soldiers when she leaves the city. She gives the power over Astapor to a council of former slaves led by a healer, a scholar and a priest, and tens of thousands of former slaves join her on her travels to Yunkai. A former butcher named Cleon fends off a scheme to have the Good Masters re-established, and was crowned as the King of Astapor in reward.

The TV show used the coastal town of Essaouira, Morocco to film scenes in Astapor.

====Yunkai====
The smallest of the three cities, Yunkai, like Meereen, does not trade in Unsullied but is known for its fighting pits and its pleasure houses, both of which turn out slaves at a brisk pace. The city is similar to Astapor in architecture except for its smaller size and its use of yellow brick in its buildings instead of red. The slavers of Yunkai are known as the Wise Masters. Because of the city&#x27;s lack of Unsullied, it relies on a mixed professional and slave army of approximately 4,000 with at least 1,000 mercenaries. Typical for Ghiscari, Yunkai soldiers wear impractical armor and oiled hair teased into enormous shapes, limiting their effectiveness.

Yunkish scenes were filmed in Aït Benhaddou, Morocco in the TV show.

====Meereen====
The largest of the three slaver cities, Meereen has a population equaling that of Astapor and Yunkai combined. The city is also the wealthiest, as besides slaves it produces wine, with a metallic taste, the lands surrounding it have massive deposits of copper, and it grows olives, before the slavers burned the trees to starve out Daenerys&#x27;s army. The city has architecture similar to that of its neighbors, but it is made of bricks of many colors. Its landscape is dominated by a massive pyramid, named the Great Pyramid, and the Temple of Graces, which is capped by a golden dome. Meereen is unique among the Ghiscari cities in that it is filled with many temples and pyramids. The slavers of Meereen are known as the Great Masters. It is built on the banks of the river Skahadhazan. After Daenerys conquers the city she continues to rule it has its queen to learn how to rule. The city eventually becomes under siege by an alliance of various city-states led by Yunkai, while a resistance known as the Sons of the Harpy rise up within.

For the HBO television series, many of the scenes in Meereen were filmed in Split and the Fortress of Klis, Croatia. In Season 5, Daznak&#x27;s Pit in the city was shot in the Plaza de Toros in Osuna, Spain.

=== Eastern Essos ===
====Red Waste ====
The Red Waste is a great desert-like area in the eastern part of Essos. Not much is known about it, since it was only briefly seen in &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; when Daenerys Targaryen and her &quot;khalasar&quot; crossed it. The only known settlement in the region, Vaes Tolorro, is in ruins.

====Qarth====
First mentioned in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, the city of Qarth has not yet appeared on any maps in the books. However, the HBO &quot;Viewer&#x27;s Guide&quot; world map and the opening titles of the TV series&#x27; second season show Qarth located at a strait between the Summer Sea and the Jade Sea in the south-east of Essos. Upon Daenerys&#x27; first visit to Qarth in &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;, the warlock Pyat Pree describes his city as the center of the world and as a gateway of commerce and culture between the east and west, and the north and south. The reader learns through Daenerys&#x27;s eyes that the city is surrounded by three graded walls of thirty to fifty feet in height, respectively engraved with portraits of animals, war, and lovemaking. The city&#x27;s buildings are of many colors, including rose, violet, and umber. Slender towers rise throughout the city, fountains adorn every square, and thousands of colored birds, blooming trees and flowers fill the city. The TV adaptation filmed Qarth on the island of Lokrum near Dubrovnik and constructed a set at the Dubac quarry in Croatia to double for the gates of Qarth.

The Qartheen are described as &quot;tall pale folk in linen and samite and tiger fur&quot;, with the women wearing gowns that leave one breast bare, while the men sport beaded silk skirts. Daenerys perceives them as &quot;nothing if not polite&quot;. Slaves serve their needs. The Pureborn, descendants of the city&#x27;s ancient kings and queens, govern Qarth and also command the city&#x27;s defenses. Three principal merchant groups battle amongst themselves and against the Pureborn for dominance of the city: the Thirteen, the Ancient Guild of Spicers, and the Tourmaline Brotherhood. Qarth&#x27;s warlocks, whose lips are turned blue from a potion called &quot;the shade of the evening&quot;, are said to brood over these factions; they are still feared although their power and prestige have waned over the years. Qarth is also home to the Sorrowful Men, a guild of assassins named so for whispering &quot;I am so sorry,&quot; before killing their victims. Daenerys leaves Qarth again at the end of &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;.

=== Unvisited lands ===
====Asshai and the Shadow Lands ====
Asshai and the Shadow Lands are mysterious locations in the &quot;Ice and Fire&quot; world. They are first mentioned in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; and were first mapped in &quot;The Lands of Ice and Fire&quot;, lying on the far east of the known world. Martin is unsure if the books will ever take the readers to Asshai, but said that readers may learn more through the POV character Melisandre (who originates from Asshai) or through the memories and mentions of other characters. Jorah Mormont describes Asshai as a port city far to the south of the Dothraki sea, at the end of the known world. Asshai exports such goods as black amethysts, amber, and dragonglass. At another time, Jorah Mormont tells Daenerys of great kingdoms to the east of the Red Waste, and lists Asshai by the Shadow as one of the cities full of wonders there. According to Martin, all ship travels between Westeros and Asshai go via the Summer Sea and the Jade Sea through the straits at Qarth, and that the common folk still believe the world to be flat. However, according to Martin, &quot;Asshai is not nearly important to trade as Yi Ti, and the rich port cities of Yi Ti (and Leng) and more easily reached via Qarth.&quot; Quaithe of the Shadow prophesies Daenerys in Qarth that &quot;To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east [...] and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.&quot; When Daenerys interprets this to mean she must go to Asshai, Quaithe says she would find the truth there.

There are many tales about the Shadow Lands, though how much truth they hold is unclear. The Dothraki believe that ghost grass covers the Shadow Lands, with stalks that glow in the dark and grow taller than a man on horseback. Daenerys heard that &quot;spellsingers, warlocks, and aeromancers practiced their arts openly in Asshai, while shadowbinders and bloodmages worked terrible sorceries in the black of night&quot;. There are also Westerosi maesters in Asshai. The mages of Asshai teach others their healing powers, but also their spells requiring blood sacrifice. Ancient books of Asshai record the Azor Ahai prophecy followed by members of the R&#x27;hllor faith. Daenerys heard that dragons themselves originated from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai and the islands of the Jade Sea, and they possibly still live there. Bran dreams of flying Dragons in Asshai. The petrified dragon eggs Illyrio gives to Daenerys are said to come from the Shadow Lands. The &quot;dour and frightening&quot; Shadow Men cover their bodies in tattoos and wear lacquered wooden masks, and the appearance of the Asshai&#x27;i is described as dark and solemn. The Dothraki believe the Asshai&#x27;i to be the spawn of shadows. The Asshai&#x27;i have a language of their own.

====Ibben====
Ibben is a collection of islands north of Essos in the Bay of Whales. The largest of these islands is Ib, which contains the cities Port of Ibben and Ib Nor. Until the Doom of Valyria, Ibben was ruled by a God-King. Now power is held by the Shadow Council, which is made up of nobles, priests, and wealthy guildsmen. Ibben is first mentioned in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, where Tyrion talks of rumors that mammoths &quot;roam the cold wastes beyond the Port of Ibben&quot;. In 2002, Martin said the narrative would &quot;probably not&quot; take readers to Ibben, which he described as a &quot;cold, mountainous, Iceland-sized island&quot; (i.e. 40,000 square miles) in the Shivering Sea, with the Port of Ibben as the major city; some Ibbenese also live on smaller islands nearby or in colonies on Essos. Ibben is unmapped in the books as of &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, but similar to Martin&#x27;s descriptions, the HBO &quot;Viewer&#x27;s Guide&quot; world map gives the island&#x27;s location as to the north-east of Essos. Martin said that due to a large whale population in the Shivering sea, many of the Ibbenses were whalers. The Ibbenses are known to chew whale blubber in order to maintain their metabolism in the cold climate. Several characters see Ibbenese whalers and cogs at the ports of King&#x27;s Landing, Braavos, Maidenpool, Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, White Harbour, and the Iron Islands. The novels describe the people of Ibben as squat and hairy; Arya even meets an Ibbenese woman with a mustache. Its implied the people may be Neanderthals. Tyrion and Varys meet foul-smelling Ibbenese, who &quot;were as fond of axes as they were of each other&quot;. Arya sees &quot;a dark brutal axeman from Ib&quot; in her dreams. The Ibbenese are said to speak with low, raspy voices and to have their own language.

====Yi Ti ====
The novels repeatedly describe Yi Ti as an empire with cities full of wonder, lying in the far east. As of &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, Yi Ti has not appeared on any maps in the books, but Martin specified that &quot;Yi Ti is to the south east of Qarth, generally, across the Jade Sea.&quot; The empire is first mentioned in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, talking of rumors that &quot;basilisks infested the jungles of Yi Ti&quot;. Sailor stories presented in &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; mention that a grey plague has hit Yi Ti. The god of the people of Yi Ti is called the Lion of Night. Daenerys sees people of Yi Ti as bright-eyed men in monkey-tail hats in the markets of Vaes Dothrak. Yi Ti has more cities than any other land in the known world, and according to Lomas Longstrider they are much larger and more splendid than cities in the west. According to Colloquo Votar there are three older cities buried beneath every YiTish city. The capital of the Golden Empire of Yi Ti is Yin, along the Jade Sea. Martin is unsure &quot;to what extent those peoples [like of Yi Ti] will ever enter this present story, however... their lands are very far away.&quot;

====Plains of Jogos Nhai====
North of Yi Ti, the Plains of Jogos Nhai are windswept, with rolling hills. They are dominated by a race of mounted warriors called the Jogos Nhai. The Jogos Nhai live in yurts and tents, and are a nomadic people. They are short, squat, and have large heads and small faces. Men and women both have pointed skulls, a result of their custom of binding the heads of newborns. They also ride zorses, a striped mount that can withstand much more than average horse. The Jogos Nhai do not fight among themselves and live in small clans bound by blood. They live in a state of perpetual war with outsiders and had been raiding many YiTish cities and have reduced around a hundred towns to ruin. Each tribe is commanded by a &quot;jhat&quot;, or war chief, and a moonsinger, who is a priestess, healer, and judge. Moonsingers are generally female, and &quot;jhats&quot; are mostly male. (Paraphrased from &quot;The World of Ice and Fire)&quot;

==Sothoryos ==
To the south of Essos is the continent of Sothoryos (mistakenly spelled Sothoros in early novels). Sothoryos is the third continent of the known world, and is vast, plague-ridden, covered in jungles, and largely unexplored. It is reported to be as large as Essos and described as a &quot;land without end&quot; by Jaenara Belaerys, a Valyrian dragonlord from before the Doom of Valyria.

The continent is first named on a map in &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; (2000), showing the cities of Yeen and Zamettar on it. The narrative itself first refers to the continent in &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; (2005). Martin had described Sothoryos in 2002 as &quot;the southern continent, roughly equivalent to Africa, jungly, plague-ridden, and largely unexplored.&quot; The novels provide little other information. The swampy nature of Sothoryos is briefly referenced by Victarion in &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, and teak from Sothoryos is said to be used to build ships. A corsair&#x27;s road runs along the continent&#x27;s northern coast. &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; refers to the diseases on Sothoryos in regards to the wealthy but sick Yunkai slave trader Yezzan zo Qaggaz. Victarion describes some people as &quot;squat and hairy as the apes of Sothoros&quot;, and some people fighting in Daznak&#x27;s Pit for Daenerys&#x27;s entertainment in &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; are described as &quot;brindle-skinned half-men from the jungles of Sothoros&quot;. Martin said that, unlike other peoples in the novels, the brindled men of Sothoryos were pure fantasy constructs.

==Ulthos ==
The map collection &quot;The Lands of Ice and Fire&quot; also shows the north tip of a landmass named &quot;Ulthos&quot; to the south of Essos and east of Sothoryos. Asked whether this was another continent, Martin replied, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s a large landmass. I am a little unclear on the formal definition of &#x27;continent&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;big island.&#x27; Also on the size of Ulthos, which after all sits at the edge of the known world. Terra incognita and all that.&quot;

<doc id="12304" wikidata="Q105269" url="?curid=12304" title="Grandmaster (chess)">
<text>Grandmaster (GM) is a title awarded to chess players by the world chess organization FIDE. Apart from World Champion, Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain. Once achieved, the title is held for life, though exceptionally the title can be revoked for cheating.

The title of Grandmaster, along with the lesser FIDE titles of International Master (IM), FIDE Master (FM), and Candidate Master (CM), is open to all players regardless of gender. The great majority of grandmasters are men, but 42 women have been awarded the GM title as of 2024, out of a total of about 2000 grandmasters. There is also a Woman Grandmaster title with lower requirements awarded only to women.

There are also Grandmaster titles for composers and solvers of chess problems, awarded by the World Federation for Chess Composition (see List of grandmasters for chess composition). The International Correspondence Chess Federation (ICCF) awards the title of International Correspondence Chess Grandmaster. Both of these bodies are now independent of FIDE, but work in cooperation with it.

&quot;Super grandmaster&quot; is an informal term to refer to the world&#x27;s elite players. In the past this would refer to players with an Elo rating of over 2600, but as the average Elo rating of the top players has increased, it has typically come to refer to players with an Elo rating of over 2700. Super GMs have some name recognition and are typically the highest earners in chess.

FIDE titles are awarded at the quarterly FIDE Council meetings. Players who have qualified for the GM title but have not yet been awarded it are informally referred to as &quot;GM-elect&quot;.

==History==
Usage of &quot;grandmaster&quot; for an expert in some field is recorded from 1590. The first known use of the term &quot;grandmaster&quot; in connection with chess was in the 18 February 1838 issue of &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life&quot;, in which a correspondent referred to William Lewis as &quot;our past grandmaster&quot;. Subsequently, George Walker and others referred to Philidor as a grandmaster, and the term was also applied to a few other players.

===Early tournament use===

The Ostend tournament of 1907 was divided into two sections: the Championship Tournament and the Masters&#x27; Tournament. The Championship section was for players who had previously won an international tournament. Siegbert Tarrasch won the Championship section, over Carl Schlechter, Dawid Janowski, Frank Marshall, Amos Burn, and Mikhail Chigorin. These players were described as grandmasters for the purposes of the tournament.

The San Sebastián 1912 tournament won by Akiba Rubinstein was a designated grandmaster event. Rubinstein won with 12½ points out of 19. Tied for second with 12 points were Aron Nimzowitsch and Rudolf Spielmann.

By some accounts, in the St. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament, the title Grandmaster was formally conferred by Russian Tsar Nicholas II, who had partially funded the tournament. The Tsar reportedly awarded the title to the five finalists: Emanuel Lasker, José Raúl Capablanca, Alexander Alekhine, Siegbert Tarrasch, and Frank Marshall. Chess historian Edward Winter has questioned this, stating that the earliest known sources that support this story are an article by Robert Lewis Taylor in the June 15, 1940, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and Marshall&#x27;s autobiography &quot;My 50 Years of Chess&quot; (1942).

===Informal and Soviet usage before 1950===
Before 1950, the term grandmaster was sometimes informally applied to world class players. The Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE, or International Chess Federation) was formed in Paris in 1924, but at that time did not award formal titles.

In 1927, the Soviet Union&#x27;s Chess Federation established the title of Grandmaster of the Soviet Union, in the form of the German loan word &quot;Großmeister&quot;. At the time Soviet players were not competing outside their own country. This title was abolished in 1931, after having been awarded to Boris Verlinsky, who won the 1929 Soviet Championship. The title was brought back in 1935, and awarded to Mikhail Botvinnik, who thus became the first &quot;official&quot; Grandmaster of the USSR. Verlinsky did not get his title back.

===Official status (1950 onwards)===

In 1950 FIDE created the titles of Grandmaster (GM), International Master (IM) and Woman Master (WM, later known as Woman International Master or WIM). The grandmaster title is sometimes called &quot;International Grandmaster&quot; (IGM), possibly to distinguish it from similar national titles, but the shortened form is far more common today.

Titles were awarded by a resolution of the FIDE General Assembly and the Qualification Committee, with no formal written criteria. FIDE first awarded the Grandmaster title in 1950 to 27 players. These players were:
* The top players of the day: world champion Mikhail Botvinnik, and those who had qualified for (or been seeded into) the inaugural Candidates Tournament in 1950: Isaac Boleslavsky, Igor Bondarevsky, David Bronstein, Max Euwe, Reuben Fine, Salo Flohr, Paul Keres, Alexander Kotov, Andor Lilienthal, Miguel Najdorf, Samuel Reshevsky, Vasily Smyslov, Gideon Ståhlberg, and László Szabó.
* Players still living who, though past their best in 1950, were recognised as having been world class when at their peak: Ossip Bernstein, Oldřich Duras, Ernst Grünfeld, Boris Kostić, Grigory Levenfish, Géza Maróczy, Jacques Mieses, Viacheslav Ragozin, Akiba Rubinstein, Friedrich Sämisch, Savielly Tartakower, and Milan Vidmar.

Since FIDE did not award the Grandmaster title posthumously, world-class players who died prior to 1950, including World Champions Steinitz, Lasker, Capablanca, and Alekhine, never received the title. A few strong still living players such as British India&#x27;s Mir Sultan Khan, Germany&#x27;s Paul Lipke and France&#x27;s Eugene Znosko-Borovsky were not awarded titles. Sultan Khan was awarded the GM title posthumously in 2024.

====1953 regulations====

Title awards under the original regulations were subject to political concerns. Efim Bogoljubow, who had emigrated from the Soviet Union to Germany, was not entered in the first class of Grandmasters, even though he had played two matches for the World Championship with Alekhine. He received the title in 1951, by a vote of thirteen to eight with five abstentions. Yugoslavia supported his application, but all other Communist countries opposed it. In 1953, FIDE abolished the old regulations, although a provision was maintained that allowed older masters who had been overlooked to be awarded titles. The new regulations awarded the title of International Grandmaster of the FIDE to players meeting any of the following criteria:
# The world champion.
# Masters who have the absolute right to play in the World Championship Candidates Tournament, or any player who replaces an absent contestant and earns at least a 50 percent score.
# The winner of an international tournament meeting specified standards, and any player placing second in two such tournaments within a span of four years. The tournament must be at least eleven rounds with seven or more players, 80 percent or more being International Grandmasters or International Masters. Additionally, 30 percent of the players must be Grandmasters who have the absolute right to play in the next World Championship Candidates Tournament, or who have played in such a tournament in the previous ten years.
# A player who demonstrates ability manifestly equal to that of (3) above in an international tournament or match. Such titles must be approved by the Qualification Committee with the support of at least five members.

====1957 regulations====
After FIDE issued the 1953 title regulations, it was recognized that they were somewhat haphazard, and work began to revise the regulations. The FIDE Congress in Vienna in 1957 adopted new regulations, called the FAV system, in recognition of the work done by International Judge Giovanni Ferrantes (Italy), Alexander (probably Conel Hugh O&#x27;Donel Alexander), and Giancarlo Dal Verme (Italy). Under the 1957 regulations, the title of International Grandmaster of the FIDE was automatically awarded to:
# The world champion.
# Any player qualifying from the Interzonal tournament to play in the Candidates Tournament, even if he did not play in the Candidates for any reason.
# Any player who would qualify from the Interzonal to play in the Candidates but who was excluded because of a limitation on the number of participants from his Federation.
# Any player who actually plays in a Candidates Tournament and scores at least 33⅓ percent.
The regulations also allowed titles to be awarded by a FIDE Congress on recommendation by the Qualification Committee. Recommendations were based on performance in qualifying tournaments, with the required score depending on the percentage of Grandmasters and International Masters in the tournament.

====1965 regulations====
Concerns were raised that the 1957 regulations were too lax. At the FIDE Congress in 1961, GM Milan Vidmar said that the regulations &quot;made it possible to award international titles to players without sufficient merit&quot;. At the 1964 Congress in Tel Aviv, a subcommittee was formed to propose changes to the regulations. The subcommittee recommended that the automatic award of titles be abolished, criticized the methods used for awarding titles based on qualifying performances, and called for a change in the makeup of the Qualification Committee. Several delegates supported the subcommittee recommendations, including GM Miguel Najdorf who felt that existing regulations were leading to an inflation of international titles. At the 1965 Congress in Wiesbaden FIDE raised the standards required for international titles. The International Grandmaster title regulations were:
* 1. Any World Champion is automatically awarded the GM title
* 2a. Anyone who scores at least 40 percent in a quarter-final match in the Candidates Tournament
* 2b. Scores at least the number of points in a tournament corresponding to the total of a 55 percent score against Grandmasters plus 75 percent against International Masters (IM) plus 85 percent against other players (a GM &quot;norm&quot;).

To fulfill requirement 2b, the candidate must score one GM norm in a category 1a tournament or two norms within a three-year period in two Category 1b tournaments, or one Category 2a tournament and one Category 1b tournament.

The categories of tournaments are:
* 1a—at least sixteen players, at least 50 percent are GMs and 70 percent at least IMs
* 1b—at least twelve players, at least 33⅓ percent GMs and 70 percent IMs
* 2a—at least fifteen players, at least 50 percent IMs
* 2b—ten to fourteen players, at least 50 percent IMs.
Since FIDE titles are for life, a GM or IM does not count for the purposes of this requirement if he had not had a GM or IM result in the five years prior to the tournament.

In addition, no more than 50 percent plus one of the players can be from the same country for tournaments of 10 to 12 players, or no more than 50 percent plus two for larger tournaments.

Seventy-four GM titles were awarded in 1951 through 1968. During that period, ten GM titles were awarded in 1965, but only one in 1966 and in 1968.

====1970 regulations====

The modern system for awarding FIDE titles evolved from the &quot;Dorazil&quot; proposals, presented to the 1970 Siegen Chess Olympiad FIDE Congress. The proposals were put together by Wilfried Dorazil (then FIDE Vice-President) and fellow Committee members Grandmaster Svetozar Gligorić and Professor Arpad Elo. The recommendations of the Committee report were adopted in full.

In essence, the proposals built on the work done by Professor Elo in devising his Elo rating system. The establishment of an updated list of players and their Elo rating enabled significantly strong international chess tournaments to be allocated a &quot;Category&quot;, based on the average rating of the contestants. For instance, it was decided that &#x27;Category 1&#x27; status would apply to tournaments with an average Elo rating of participants falling within the range 2251–2275; similarly Category 2 would apply to the range 2276–2300 etc. The higher the tournament Category, the stronger the tournament.

Another vital component involved the setting of meritorious norms for each Category of tournament. Players must meet or surpass the relevant score to demonstrate that they had performed at Grandmaster (GM) or International Master (IM) level. Scores were expressed as percentages of a perfect maximum score and decreased as the tournament Category increased, thereby reflecting the strength of a player&#x27;s opposition and the relative difficulty of the task.

Tournament organisers could then apply the percentages to their own tournament format and declare in advance the actual score that participants must achieve to attain a GM or IM result (nowadays referred to as a norm).

To qualify for the Grandmaster title, a player needed to achieve three such GM results within a rolling period of three years. Exceptionally, if a player&#x27;s contributory games totalled 30 or more, then the title could be awarded on the basis of two such results. There were also circumstances where the system could be adapted to fit team events and other competitions.

The full proposals included many other rules and regulations, covering such topics as:
* Eligible tournament formats
* Eligible participants
* Unrated participants
* Registration of tournaments with FIDE
* Calculations, including the handling of fractions

==Current regulations==
To become a grandmaster, a player must achieve both of the following:

* Favorable results (called norms) from a total of at least 27 games in tournaments. With some exceptions, to receive a norm in a tournament:
** The player&#x27;s performance rating at the end of the tournament must be at least 2600. (Tournaments are no longer classified in categories.)
** At least 33% of the player&#x27;s opponents must be Grandmasters.
** At least 50% of the player&#x27;s opponents must hold a FIDE title other than Candidate Master and Woman Candidate Master.
** The player&#x27;s opponents must have an average rating of at least 2380.
** The player&#x27;s opponents must come from at least 3 different chess federations, which can include the player&#x27;s own federation.
*** A maximum of 60% of a player&#x27;s opponents can come from the player&#x27;s own federation.
*** A maximum of 66% of a player&#x27;s opponents can come from a single federation.
** At least one norm must be scored at a Swiss tournament with at least 40 participants of average rating of 2000 and above.
* An Elo rating of at least 2500 at any point (although they need not maintain this level to obtain or keep the title).
** The rating requirement can be fulfilled even if the player starts a tournament rated below 2500 and then reaches or exceeds a 2500 rating during the tournament but eventually concludes the tournament with a rating lower than 2500.

The Grandmaster title is also automatically conferred, without needing to fulfill the above criteria, when reaching the final 16 in the World Cup, winning the Women&#x27;s World Cup, the World Junior Championship, or the World Senior Championship, or a Continental Chess Championship, given that the player&#x27;s peak FIDE rating is at least 2300. Current regulations can be found in the FIDE Handbook.

FIDE titles including the grandmaster title are valid for life, but FIDE regulations allow a title to be revoked for &quot;use of a FIDE title or rating to subvert the ethical principles of the title or rating system&quot; or if a player is found to have violated the anti-cheating regulations in a tournament on which the title application was based.

Exact regulations can be found in the FIDE Handbook.

==Title inflation==
A report prepared by Bartłomiej Macieja for the Association of Chess Professionals mentions discussion at the FIDE congress of 2008 regarding a perceived decrease in value of the grandmaster title. The number of grandmasters had increased greatly between 1972 and 2008, but according to Macieja, the number of registered players rated over 2200 had increased even faster. Since that FIDE congress, discussion of the value of the grandmaster title has occasionally continued.

==Honorary grandmasters==
Starting from 1977, FIDE awarded honorary Grandmaster titles to 32 players based on their past performances or other contributions to chess. The following players have been awarded honorary Grandmaster titles. Marić and Honfi were awarded the title posthumously in the year of their death, and Sultan Khan 58 years later.
* 1977 – Julio Bolbochán, Esteban Canal, Borislav Milić, Carlos Torre Repetto
* 1981 – Arnold Denker
* 1982 – Lodewijk Prins, Raúl Sanguineti
* 1983 – Vladimir Alatortsev, Alexander Konstantinopolsky, Erik Lundin
* 1984 – Eero Böök, Stojan Puc
* 1985 – Harry Golombek, Mario Monticelli, Jaroslav Šajtar
* 1986 – Arthur Dake, Theodor Ghițescu
* 1987 – Vladimir Makogonov, Vladas Mikėnas, Bogdan Śliwa
* 1988 – George Koltanowski
* 1990 – Andrija Fuderer, Rudolf Marić (posthumously)
* 1991 – Dragoljub Minić
* 1992 – Heinz Lehmann, Rudolf Teschner

<text>Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (; 22 January 1729 – 15 February 1781) was a German philosopher, dramatist, publicist and art critic, and a representative of the Enlightenment era. His plays and theoretical writings substantially influenced the development of German literature. He is widely considered by theatre historians to be the first dramaturg in his role at Abel Seyler&#x27;s Hamburg National Theatre.

==Life==

Lessing was born in Kamenz, a small town in Saxony, to pastor and theologian (1693–1770) and his wife Justine Salome Feller (1703–1777), daughter of pastor of Kamenz, Gottfried Feller (1674–1733). His father was a Lutheran minister and wrote on theology. Young Lessing studied at the Latin School in Kamenz from 1737 to 1741. With a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps, Lessing next attended the Fürstenschule St. Afra in Meissen. After completing his education at St. Afra&#x27;s, he enrolled at Leipzig University where he pursued a degree in theology, medicine, philosophy, and philology (1746–1748).

It was here that his relationship with Karoline Neuber, a famous German actress, began. He translated several French plays for her, and his interest in theatre grew. During this time, he wrote his first play, &quot;The Young Scholar.&quot; Neuber eventually produced the play in 1748.

From 1748 to 1760, Lessing lived in Leipzig and Berlin. He began to work as a reviewer and editor for the &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot; and other periodicals. Lessing formed a close connection with his cousin, Christlob Mylius, and decided to follow him to Berlin. In 1750, Lessing and Mylius teamed together to begin a periodical publication named &quot;Beiträge zur Historie und Aufnahme des Theaters&quot;. The publication ran only four issues, but it caught the public&#x27;s eye and revealed Lessing to be a serious critic and theorist of drama.

In 1752, he took his master&#x27;s degree in Wittenberg. From 1760 to 1765, he worked in Breslau (now Wrocław) as secretary to General Tauentzien during the Seven Years&#x27; War between Britain and France, which had effects in Europe. It was during this time that he wrote his famous .

In 1765, Lessing returned to Berlin, leaving in 1767 to work for three years at the Hamburg National Theatre. Actor-manager Konrad Ackermann began construction of Germany&#x27;s first permanent national theatre in Hamburg, established by . The owners of the new Hamburg National Theatre hired Lessing as the theatre&#x27;s critic of plays and acting, an activity later known as dramaturgy (based on his own words), making Lessing the very first dramaturge. The theatre&#x27;s main backer was Abel Seyler, a former currency speculator who since became known as &quot;the leading patron of German theatre.&quot; There he met Eva König, his future wife. His work in Hamburg formed the basis of his pioneering work on drama, titled &quot;Hamburgische Dramaturgie&quot;. Unfortunately, because of financial losses due to pirated editions of the &quot;Hamburgische Dramaturgie&quot;, the Hamburg Theatre closed just three years later.

In 1770, Lessing became librarian at the ducal library, now the Herzog August Library (&quot;Herzog-August-Bibliothek&quot;, &quot;Bibliotheca Augusta&quot;), in Wolfenbüttel under the commission of the Duke of Brunswick. His tenure there was energetic, if interrupted by many journeys. In 1775, for example, he accompanied Prince Leopold to Italy. Follower of Spinoza&#x27;s philosophy, on 14 October 1771, Lessing was initiated into Freemasonry in the lodge &quot;Zu den drei Goldenen Rosen&quot; in Hamburg.

In 1773, he discovered Archimedes&#x27; cattle problem in a Greek manuscript containing a poem of 44 lines, in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel. This problem would remain unsolved until 1880. In 1776, he married Eva König, who was then a widow, in Jork (near Hamburg). She died in 1778 after giving birth to a short-lived son. On 15 February 1781, Lessing, aged 52, died during a visit to the wine dealer Angott in Brunswick.

Lessing was also famous for his friendship with Jewish-German philosopher Moses Mendelssohn. A 2003 biography of Mendelssohn&#x27;s grandson, Felix, describes their friendship as one of the most &quot;illuminating metaphors [for] the clarion call of the Enlightenment for religious tolerance&quot;. It was this relationship that sparked his interest in popular religious debates of the time. He began publishing heated pamphlets on his beliefs which were eventually banned. It was this banishment that inspired him to return to theatre to portray his views and to write &quot;Nathan the Wise&quot;.

==Works==
Early in his life, Lessing showed interest in the theatre. In his theoretical and critical writings on the subject—as in his own plays—he tried to contribute to the development of a new type of theatre in Germany. With this he especially turned against the then predominant literary theory of Gottsched and his followers. Lessing&#x27;s &quot;Hamburgische Dramaturgie&quot; ran critiques of plays that were performed in the Hamburg Theatre, but after dealing with dissatisfied actors and actresses, Lessing redirected his writings to more of an analysis on the proper uses of drama. Lessing advocated the outline of drama in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;. He believed the French Academy had devalued the uses of drama through their neoclassical rules of form and separation of genres. His repeated opinions on this issue influenced theatre practitioners who began the movement of rejecting theatre rules known as &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; (&quot;Storm and Stress&quot;). He also supported serious reception of Shakespeare&#x27;s works. He worked with many theatre groups (e.g. the one of the Neuberin).

In Hamburg he tried with others to set up the German National Theatre. Today his own works appear as prototypes of the later developed bourgeois German drama. Scholars see &quot;Miss Sara Sampson&quot; and &quot;Emilia Galotti&quot; as amongst the first bourgeois tragedies, &quot;Minna von Barnhelm&quot; (Minna of Barnhelm) as the model for many classic German comedies, &quot;Nathan the Wise&quot; (&quot;Nathan der Weise&quot;) as the first German drama of ideas (&quot;Ideendrama&quot;). His theoretical writings &quot;Laocoön&quot; and &quot;Hamburg Dramaturgy&quot; (&quot;Hamburgische Dramaturgie&quot;) set the standards for the discussion of aesthetic and literary theoretical principles. Lessing advocated that dramaturgs should carry their work out working directly with theatre companies rather than in isolation.

In his religious and philosophical writings he defended the faithful Christian&#x27;s right for freedom of thought. He argued against the belief in revelation and the holding on to a literal interpretation of the Bible by the predominant orthodox doctrine through a problem later to be called Lessing&#x27;s Ditch. Lessing outlined the concept of the religious &quot;Proof of Power&quot;: How can miracles continue to be used as a base for Christianity when we have no proof of miracles? Historical truths which are in doubt cannot be used to prove metaphysical truths (such as God&#x27;s existence). As Lessing says it: &quot;That, then, is the ugly great ditch which I cannot cross, however often and however earnestly I have tried to make that leap.&quot;

In the final leg of his life, Lessing threw himself into an intense evaluation of theology and religion. He did much of his studying by reading manuscripts he found while working as a librarian. While working for the Duke, he formed a close friendship with a family by the name of Reimarus. The family held an unpublished manuscript by Hermann Samuel Reimarus which attacked the historicity of Christian revelation. Despite discouragement from his brother Karl Gotthelf Lessing, he began publishing pieces of the manuscript in pamphlets known as &quot;Fragments from an Unnamed Author&quot;. The controversial pamphlets resulted in a heated debate between him and another theologian, Johann Melchior Goeze. In concern for tarnishing his reputation, Goeze requested the government put an end to the feud, and Lessing was silenced through a law that took away his freedom from censorship.

In response, Lessing relied upon his skills as a playwright to write what is undoubtedly his most influential play, &quot;Nathan the Wise&quot;. In the play, Lessing set up tension between Judaism, Islam, and Christianity by having one character ask Nathan which religion was the most genuine. Nathan avoids the question by telling the parable of the three rings, which implies the idea that no specific religion is the &quot;correct religion.&quot; The Enlightenment ideas to which Lessing held tight were portrayed through his &quot;ideal of humanity,&quot; stating that religion is relative to the individual&#x27;s ability to reason. &quot;Nathan the Wise&quot; is considered to be the first example of the German &quot;literature of humanity&quot;. 
As a child of the Enlightenment he trusted in a &quot;Christianity of Reason&quot;, which oriented itself by the spirit of religion. He believed that human reason (initiated by criticism and dissent) would develop, even without help by a divine revelation. In his writing &quot;The Education of Humankind&quot; (&quot;Die Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts&quot;) he extensively and coherently lays out his position.

The idea of freedom (for the theatre against the dominance of its French model; for religion from the church&#x27;s dogma) is his central theme throughout his life. Therefore, he also stood up for the liberation of the upcoming middle and upper class from the nobility making up their minds for them.

In his own literary existence he also constantly strove for independence. But his ideal of a possible life as a free author was hard to keep up against the economic constraints he faced. His project of authors self-publishing their works, which he tried to accomplish in Hamburg with C. J. Bode, failed.

Lessing is important as a literary critic for his work &quot;Laocoon: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry&quot;. In this work, he argues against the tendency to take Horace&#x27;s &quot;ut pictura poesis&quot; (as painting, so poetry) as prescriptive for literature. In other words, he objected to trying to write poetry using the same devices as one would in painting. Instead, poetry and painting each has its character (the former is extended in time; the latter is extended in space). This is related to Lessing&#x27;s turn from French classicism to Aristotelian mimesis, discussed above.

== Attack by Johann Daniel Müller ==
The Radical Pietist (born 1716 in Wissenbach/Nassau, today part of Eschenburg, deceased after 1785) published the following anonymous book against Lessing and Reimarus:
* Johann Daniel Müller: &quot;Der Sieg der Wahrheit des Worts Gottes über die Lügen des Wolfenbüttelschen Bibliothecarii,&quot; [Gotthold] &quot;Ephraim Lessing, und seines Fragmenten-Schreibers&quot; [i. e. Hermann Samuel Reimarus] &quot;in ihren Lästerungen gegen Jesum Christum, seine Jünger, Apostel, und die ganze Bibel.&quot; 1780.

<text>Geotechnical engineering, also known as geotechnics, is the branch of civil engineering concerned with the engineering behavior of earth materials. It uses the principles of soil mechanics and rock mechanics to solve its engineering problems. It also relies on knowledge of geology, hydrology, geophysics, and other related sciences. 

Geotechnical engineering has applications in military engineering, mining engineering, petroleum engineering, coastal engineering, and offshore construction. The fields of geotechnical engineering and engineering geology have overlapping knowledge areas. However, while geotechnical engineering is a specialty of civil engineering, engineering geology is a specialty of geology.

==History==
Humans have historically used soil as a material for flood control, irrigation purposes, burial sites, building foundations, and construction materials for buildings. Dykes, dams, and canals dating back to at least 2000 BCE—found in parts of ancient Egypt, ancient Mesopotamia, the Fertile Crescent, and the early settlements of Mohenjo Daro and Harappa in the Indus valley—provide evidence for early activities linked to irrigation and flood control. As cities expanded, structures were erected and supported by formalized foundations. The ancient Greeks notably constructed pad footings and strip-and-raft foundations. Until the 18th century, however, no theoretical basis for soil design had been developed, and the discipline was more of an art than a science, relying on experience.

Several foundation-related engineering problems, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa, prompted scientists to begin taking a more scientific-based approach to examining the subsurface. The earliest advances occurred in the development of earth pressure theories for the construction of retaining walls. Henri Gautier, a French royal engineer, recognized the &quot;natural slope&quot; of different soils in 1717, an idea later known as the soil&#x27;s angle of repose. Around the same time, a rudimentary soil classification system was also developed based on a material&#x27;s unit weight, which is no longer considered a good indication of soil type.

The application of the principles of mechanics to soils was documented as early as 1773 when Charles Coulomb, a physicist and engineer, developed improved methods to determine the earth pressures against military ramparts. Coulomb observed that, at failure, a distinct slip plane would form behind a sliding retaining wall and suggested that the maximum shear stress on the slip plane, for design purposes, was the sum of the soil cohesion, formula_1, and friction formula_2 formula_3, where formula_2 is the normal stress on the slip plane and formula_5 is the friction angle of the soil. By combining Coulomb&#x27;s theory with Christian Otto Mohr&#x27;s 2D stress state, the theory became known as Mohr-Coulomb theory. Although it is now recognized that precise determination of cohesion is impossible because formula_1 is not a fundamental soil property, the Mohr-Coulomb theory is still used in practice today.

In the 19th century, Henry Darcy developed what is now known as Darcy&#x27;s Law, describing the flow of fluids in a porous media. Joseph Boussinesq, a mathematician and physicist, developed theories of stress distribution in elastic solids that proved useful for estimating stresses at depth in the ground. William Rankine, an engineer and physicist, developed an alternative to Coulomb&#x27;s earth pressure theory. Albert Atterberg developed the clay consistency indices that are still used today for soil classification. In 1885, Osborne Reynolds recognized that shearing causes volumetric dilation of dense materials and contraction of loose granular materials.

Modern geotechnical engineering is said to have begun in 1925 with the publication of &quot;Erdbaumechanik&quot; by Karl von Terzaghi, a mechanical engineer and geologist. Considered by many to be the father of modern soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering, Terzaghi developed the principle of effective stress, and demonstrated that the shear strength of soil is controlled by effective stress. Terzaghi also developed the framework for theories of bearing capacity of foundations, and the theory for prediction of the rate of settlement of clay layers due to consolidation. Afterwards, Maurice Biot fully developed the three-dimensional soil consolidation theory, extending the one-dimensional model previously developed by Terzaghi to more general hypotheses and introducing the set of basic equations of Poroelasticity. 

In his 1948 book, Donald Taylor recognized that the interlocking and dilation of densely packed particles contributed to the peak strength of the soil. Roscoe, Schofield, and Wroth, with the publication of &quot;On the Yielding of Soils&quot; in 1958, established the interrelationships between the volume change behavior (dilation, contraction, and consolidation) and shearing behavior with the theory of plasticity using critical state soil mechanics. Critical state soil mechanics is the basis for many contemporary advanced constitutive models describing the behavior of soil. 

In 1960, Alec Skempton carried out an extensive review of the available formulations and experimental data in the literature about the effective stress validity in soil, concrete, and rock in order to reject some of these expressions, as well as clarify what expressions were appropriate according to several working hypotheses, such as stress-strain or strength behavior, saturated or non-saturated media, and rock, concrete or soil behavior.

== Roles ==

=== Geotechnical investigation ===
Geotechnical engineers investigate and determine the properties of subsurface conditions and materials. They also design corresponding earthworks and retaining structures, tunnels, and structure foundations, and may supervise and evaluate sites, which may further involve site monitoring as well as the risk assessment and mitigation of natural hazards.

Geotechnical engineers and engineering geologists perform geotechnical investigations to obtain information on the physical properties of soil and rock underlying and adjacent to a site to design earthworks and foundations for proposed structures and for the repair of distress to earthworks and structures caused by subsurface conditions. Geotechnical investigations involve surface and subsurface exploration of a site, often including subsurface sampling and laboratory testing of retrieved soil samples. Sometimes, geophysical methods are also used to obtain data, which include measurement of seismic waves (pressure, shear, and Rayleigh waves), surface-wave methods and downhole methods, and electromagnetic surveys (magnetometer, resistivity, and ground-penetrating radar). Electrical tomography can be used to survey soil and rock properties and existing underground infrastructure in construction projects.

Surface exploration can include on-foot surveys, geologic mapping, geophysical methods, and photogrammetry. Geologic mapping and interpretation of geomorphology are typically completed in consultation with a geologist or engineering geologist. Subsurface exploration usually involves in-situ testing (for example, the standard penetration test and cone penetration test). The digging of test pits and trenching (particularly for locating faults and slide planes) may also be used to learn about soil conditions at depth. Large-diameter borings are rarely used due to safety concerns and expense. Still, they are sometimes used to allow a geologist or engineer to be lowered into the borehole for direct visual and manual examination of the soil and rock stratigraphy.

Various soil samplers exist to meet the needs of different engineering projects. The standard penetration test, which uses a thick-walled split spoon sampler, is the most common way to collect disturbed samples. Piston samplers, employing a thin-walled tube, are most commonly used to collect less disturbed samples. More advanced methods, such as the Sherbrooke block sampler, are superior but expensive. Coring frozen ground provides high-quality undisturbed samples from ground conditions, such as fill, sand, moraine, and rock fracture zones. 

Geotechnical centrifuge modeling is another method of testing physical-scale models of geotechnical problems. The use of a centrifuge enhances the similarity of the scale model tests involving soil because soil&#x27;s strength and stiffness are susceptible to the confining pressure. The centrifugal acceleration allows a researcher to obtain large (prototype-scale) stresses in small physical models.

=== Foundation design ===

The foundation of a structure&#x27;s infrastructure transmits loads from the structure to the earth. Geotechnical engineers design foundations based on the load characteristics of the structure and the properties of the soils and bedrock at the site. Generally, geotechnical engineers first estimate the magnitude and location of loads to be supported before developing an investigation plan to explore the subsurface and determine the necessary soil parameters through field and lab testing. Following this, they may begin the design of an engineering foundation. The primary considerations for a geotechnical engineer in foundation design are bearing capacity, settlement, and ground movement beneath the foundations. 

=== Earthworks ===
Geotechnical engineers are also involved in the planning and execution of earthworks, which include ground improvement, slope stabilization, and slope stability analysis. 

====Ground improvement====
Various geotechnical engineering methods can be used for ground improvement, including reinforcement geosynthetics such as geocells and geogrids, which disperse loads over a larger area, increasing the soil&#x27;s load-bearing capacity. Through these methods, geotechnical engineers can reduce direct and long-term costs.

====Slope stabilization====

Geotechnical engineers can analyze and improve slope stability using engineering methods. Slope stability is determined by the balance of shear stress and shear strength. A previously stable slope may be initially affected by various factors, making it unstable. Nonetheless, geotechnical engineers can design and implement engineered slopes to increase stability.

=====Slope stability analysis=====
Stability analysis is needed to design engineered slopes and estimate the risk of slope failure in natural or designed slopes by determining the conditions under which the topmost mass of soil will slip relative to the base of soil and lead to slope failure. If the interface between the mass and the base of a slope has a complex geometry, slope stability analysis is difficult and numerical solution methods are required. Typically, the interface&#x27;s exact geometry is unknown, and a simplified interface geometry is assumed. Finite slopes require three-dimensional models to be analyzed, so most slopes are analyzed assuming that they are infinitely wide and can be represented by two-dimensional models.

== Sub-disciplines ==

=== Geosynthetics ===

Geosynthetics are a type of plastic polymer products used in geotechnical engineering that improve engineering performance while reducing costs. This includes geotextiles, geogrids, geomembranes, geocells, and geocomposites. The synthetic nature of the products make them suitable for use in the ground where high levels of durability are required. Their main functions include drainage, filtration, reinforcement, separation, and containment. 

Geosynthetics are available in a wide range of forms and materials, each to suit a slightly different end-use, although they are frequently used together. Some reinforcement geosynthetics, such as geogrids and more recently, cellular confinement systems, have shown to improve bearing capacity, modulus factors and soil stiffness and strength. These products have a wide range of applications and are currently used in many civil and geotechnical engineering applications including roads, airfields, railroads, embankments, piled embankments, retaining structures, reservoirs, canals, dams, landfills, bank protection and coastal engineering.

=== Offshore ===

&quot;Offshore&quot; (or &quot;marine&quot;) &quot;geotechnical engineering&quot; is concerned with foundation design for human-made structures in the sea, away from the coastline (in opposition to &quot;onshore&quot; or &quot;nearshore&quot; engineering). Oil platforms, artificial islands and submarine pipelines are examples of such structures.

There are a number of significant differences between onshore and offshore geotechnical engineering. Notably, site investigation and ground improvement on the seabed are more expensive; the offshore structures are exposed to a wider range of geohazards; and the environmental and financial consequences are higher in case of failure. Offshore structures are exposed to various environmental loads, notably wind, waves and currents. These phenomena may affect the integrity or the serviceability of the structure and its foundation during its operational lifespan and need to be taken into account in offshore design.

In subsea geotechnical engineering, seabed materials are considered a two-phase material composed of rock or mineral particles and water. Structures may be fixed in place in the seabed—as is the case for piers, jetties and fixed-bottom wind turbines—or may comprise a floating structure that remains roughly fixed relative to its geotechnical anchor point. Undersea mooring of human-engineered floating structures include a large number of offshore oil and gas platforms and, since 2008, a few floating wind turbines. Two common types of engineered design for anchoring floating structures include tension-leg and catenary loose mooring systems.

==Observational method==

First proposed by Karl Terzaghi and later discussed in a paper by Ralph B. Peck, the observational method is a managed process of construction control, monitoring, and review, which enables modifications to be incorporated during and after construction. The method aims to achieve a greater overall economy without compromising safety by creating designs based on the most probable conditions rather than the most unfavorable. Using the observational method, gaps in available information are filled by measurements and investigation, which aid in assessing the behavior of the structure during construction, which in turn can be modified per the findings. The method was described by Peck as &quot;learn-as-you-go&quot;.

The observational method may be described as follows:

# General exploration sufficient to establish the rough nature, pattern, and properties of deposits.
#Assessment of the most probable conditions and the most unfavorable conceivable deviations. 
#Creating the design based on a working hypothesis of behavior anticipated under the most probable conditions.
#Selection of quantities to be observed as construction proceeds and calculating their anticipated values based on the working hypothesis under the most unfavorable conditions.
#Selection, in advance, of a course of action or design modification for every foreseeable significant deviation of the observational findings from those predicted.
#Measurement of quantities and evaluation of actual conditions.
#Design modification per actual conditions

The observational method is suitable for construction that has already begun when an unexpected development occurs or when a failure or accident looms or has already happened. It is unsuitable for projects whose design cannot be altered during construction.

<text>Gustave Flaubert ( , ; ; 12 December 1821 – 8 May 1880) was a French novelist. He has been considered the leading exponent of literary realism in his country and abroad. According to the literary theorist Kornelije Kvas, &quot;in Flaubert, realism strives for formal perfection, so the presentation of reality tends to be neutral, emphasizing the values and importance of style as an objective method of presenting reality&quot;. He is known especially for his debut novel &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; (1857), his &quot;Correspondence&quot;, and his scrupulous devotion to his style and aesthetics. The celebrated short story writer Guy de Maupassant was a protégé of Flaubert. 

==Life==

===Early life and education===
Flaubert was born in Rouen, in the Seine-Maritime department of Upper Normandy, in northern France. He was the second son of Anne Justine Caroline (née Fleuriot; 1793–1872) and Achille-Cléophas Flaubert (1784–1846), director and senior surgeon of the major hospital in Rouen. He began writing at an early age, as early as eight according to some sources.

He was educated at the Lycée Pierre-Corneille in Rouen, and did not leave until 1840, whereupon he went to Paris to study law. In Paris, he was an indifferent student and found the city distasteful. He made a few acquaintances, including Victor Hugo. Toward the end of 1840, he traveled in the Pyrenees and Corsica. In 1846, after an attack of epilepsy, he left Paris and abandoned the study of law.

===Personal life===
From 1846 to 1854, Flaubert had a relationship with the poet Louise Colet; his letters to her survived. After leaving Paris, he returned to Croisset, near the Seine, close to Rouen, and lived there for the rest of his life. He did however make occasional visits to Paris and England, where he apparently had a mistress.

Politically, Flaubert described himself as a &quot;romantic and liberal old dunce&quot; (), an &quot;enraged liberal&quot; (), a hater of all despotism, and one who celebrated every protest of the individual against power and monopolies.

With his lifelong friend Maxime Du Camp, he traveled in Brittany in 1846. In 1849–50 he went on a long journey to the Middle East, visiting Greece and Egypt. In Beirut he contracted syphilis. He spent five weeks in Istanbul in 1850. He visited Carthage in 1858 to conduct research for his novel &quot;Salammbô&quot;.

Flaubert did not marry or have children. In a 1852 letter to Colet, he explained his reasons for not wanting children, saying he would &quot;transmit to no one the aggravations and the disgrace of existence&quot;.

Flaubert was very open about his sexual activities with prostitutes in his travel writings. He suspected that a chancre on his penis was from a Maronite or a Turkish girl. He also engaged in intercourse with male prostitutes in Beirut and Egypt; in one of his letters, he describes a &quot;pockmarked young rascal wearing a white turban&quot;.

According to his biographer Émile Faguet, his affair with Louise Colet was his only serious romantic relationship.

Flaubert was a diligent worker and often complained in his letters to friends about the strenuous nature of his work. He was close to his niece, Caroline Commanville, and had a close friendship and correspondence with George Sand. He occasionally visited Parisian acquaintances, including Émile Zola, Alphonse Daudet, Ivan Turgenev, and Edmond and Jules de Goncourt.

The 1870s were a difficult time for Flaubert. Prussian soldiers occupied his house during the War of 1870, and his mother died in 1872. After her death, he fell into financial difficulty due to business failures on the part of his niece&#x27;s husband. Flaubert lived with venereal diseases most of his life. His health declined and he died at Croisset of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1880 at the age of 58. He was buried in the family vault in the cemetery of Rouen. A monument to him by Henri Chapu was unveiled at the museum of Rouen.

===Writing career===

His first finished work was &quot;November&quot;, a novella, which was completed in 1842.

In September 1849, Flaubert completed the first version of a novel, &quot;The Temptation of Saint Anthony.&quot; He read the novel aloud to Louis Bouilhet and Maxime Du Camp over the course of four days, not allowing them to interrupt or give any opinions. At the end of the reading, his friends told him to throw the manuscript in the fire, suggesting instead that he focus on day-to-day life rather than fantastic subjects.

In 1850, after returning from Egypt, Flaubert began work on &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;. The novel, which took five years to write, was serialized in the &quot;Revue de Paris&quot; in 1856. The government brought an action against the publisher and author on the charge of immorality, which was heard during the following year, but both were acquitted. When &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; appeared in book form, it met with a warm reception.

In 1858, Flaubert travelled to Carthage to gather material for his next novel, &quot;Salammbô&quot;. The novel was completed in 1862 after four years of work.

Drawing on his youth, Flaubert next wrote &quot;L&#x27;Éducation sentimentale&quot; (&quot;Sentimental Education&quot;), an effort that took seven years. This was his last complete novel, published in the year 1869. The story focuses on the romantic life of a young man named Frédéric Moreau at the time of the French Revolution of 1848 and the founding of the Second French Empire.

He wrote an unsuccessful drama, &quot;Le Candidat&quot;, and published a reworked version of &quot;The Temptation of Saint Anthony&quot;, portions of which had been published as early as 1857. He devoted much of his time to an ongoing project, &quot;Les Deux Cloportes&quot; (&quot;The Two Woodlice&quot;), which later became &quot;Bouvard et Pécuchet&quot;, breaking the obsessive project only to write the &quot;Three Tales&quot; in 1877. This book comprises three stories: &quot;Un Cœur simple&quot; (&quot;A Simple Heart&quot;), &quot;La Légende de Saint-Julien l&#x27;Hospitalier&quot; (&quot;The Legend of St. Julian the Hospitaller&quot;), and &quot;Hérodias&quot; (&quot;Herodias&quot;). After the publication of the stories, he spent the remainder of his life toiling on the unfinished &quot;Bouvard et Pécuchet&quot;, which was posthumously printed in 1881. It was a grand satire on the futility of human knowledge and the ubiquity of mediocrity. He believed the work to be his masterpiece, though the posthumous version received lukewarm reviews. Flaubert was a prolific letter writer, and his letters have been collected in several publications.

At the time of his death, he may have been working on a further historical novel, based on the Battle of Thermopylae.

==Perfectionist style==
Flaubert famously avoided the inexact, the abstract and the vaguely inapt expression, and scrupulously eschewed the cliché. In a letter to George Sand he said that he spent his time &quot;trying to write harmonious sentences, avoiding assonances&quot;.

Flaubert believed in and pursued the principle of finding &quot;le mot juste&quot; (&quot;the right word&quot;), which he considered as the key means to achieve high quality in literary art. He worked in sullen solitude, sometimes occupying a week in the completion of one page, never satisfied with what he had composed. In Flaubert&#x27;s correspondence he intimates this, explaining correct prose did not flow out of him and that his style was achieved through work and revision. Flaubert said he wished to forge a style &quot;that would be rhythmic as verse, precise as the language of the sciences, undulant, deep-voiced as a cello, tipped with flame: a style that would pierce your idea like a dagger, and on which your thought would sail easily ahead over a smooth surface, like a skiff before a good tail wind.&quot; He famously said that &quot;an author in his book must be like God in the universe, present everywhere and visible nowhere.&quot;

This painstaking style of writing is also evident when one compares Flaubert&#x27;s output over a lifetime to that of his peers (for example Balzac or Zola). Flaubert published much less prolifically than was the norm for his time and never got near the pace of a novel a year, as his peers often achieved during their peaks of activity. Walter Pater famously called Flaubert the &quot;martyr of style&quot;.

==Legacy==
In the assessment of critic James Wood:
As a writer, other than a pure stylist, Flaubert was nearly equal parts romantic and realist. Hence, members of various schools, especially realists and formalists, have traced their origins to his work. The exactitude with which he adapts his expressions to his purpose can be seen in all parts of his work, especially in the portraits he draws of the figures in his principal romances. The degree to which Flaubert&#x27;s fame has extended since his death presents &quot;an interesting chapter of literary history in itself&quot;. He is also credited with spreading the popularity of the color Tuscany Cypress, a color often mentioned in his chef-d&#x27;œuvre &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;.

Flaubert&#x27;s lean and precise writing style has had a large influence on 20th-century writers such as Franz Kafka and J. M. Coetzee. As Vladimir Nabokov discussed in his famous lecture series:

The greatest literary influence upon Kafka was Flaubert&#x27;s. Flaubert who loathed pretty-pretty prose would have applauded Kafka&#x27;s attitude towards his tool. Kafka liked to draw his terms from the language of law and science, giving them a kind of ironic precision, with no intrusion of the author&#x27;s private sentiments; this was exactly Flaubert&#x27;s method through which he achieved a singular poetic effect. The legacy of his work habits can best be described, therefore, as paving the way towards a slower and more introspective manner of writing.

The publication of &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; in 1856 was followed by more scandal than admiration; it was not understood at first that this novel was the beginning of something new: the scrupulously truthful portraiture of life. Gradually, this aspect of his genius was accepted, and it began to crowd out all others. At the time of his death, he was widely regarded as the most influential French Realist. Under this aspect Flaubert exercised an extraordinary influence over Guy de Maupassant, Edmond de Goncourt, Alphonse Daudet, and Émile Zola. Even after the decline of the Realist school, Flaubert did not lose prestige in the literary community; he continues to appeal to other writers because of his deep commitment to aesthetic principles, his devotion to style, and his indefatigable pursuit of the perfect expression.

His &quot;Œuvres Complètes&quot; (8 vols., 1885) were printed from the original manuscripts, and included, besides the works mentioned already, the two plays &quot;Le Candidat&quot; and &quot;Le Château des cœurs&quot;. Another edition (10 vols.) appeared in 1873–85. Flaubert&#x27;s correspondence with George Sand was published in 1884 with an introduction by Guy de Maupassant.

He has been admired or written about by almost every major literary personality of the 20th century, including philosophers and sociologists such as Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, Pierre Bourdieu, and Jean-Paul Sartre, the latter of whose partially psychoanalytic portrait of Flaubert in &quot;The Family Idiot&quot; was published in 1971. Georges Perec named &quot;Sentimental Education&quot; as one of his favourite novels. The Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa is another great admirer of Flaubert. Apart from &quot;Perpetual Orgy&quot;, which is solely devoted to Flaubert&#x27;s art, one can find lucid discussions in Vargas Llosa&#x27;s &quot;Letters to a Young Novelist&quot; (published 2003). In a public lecture in May 1966 at the Kaufmann Art Gallery in New York, Marshall McLuhan claimed: &quot;I derived all my knowledge of media from people like Flaubert and Rimbaud and Baudelaire.&quot;

On the occasion of Flaubert&#x27;s 198th birthday (12 December 2019), a group of researchers at CNRS published a neural language model under his name.

<doc id="12308" wikidata="Q930837" url="?curid=12308" title="Gregory Chaitin">
<text>Gregory John Chaitin ( ; born 25 June 1947) is an Argentine-American mathematician and computer scientist. Beginning in the late 1960s, Chaitin made contributions to algorithmic information theory and metamathematics, in particular a computer-theoretic result equivalent to Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem. He is considered to be one of the founders of what is today known as algorithmic (Solomonoff–Kolmogorov–Chaitin, Kolmogorov or program-size) complexity together with Andrei Kolmogorov and Ray Solomonoff. Along with the works of e.g. Solomonoff, Kolmogorov, Martin-Löf, and Leonid Levin, algorithmic information theory became a foundational part of theoretical computer science, information theory, and mathematical logic. It is a common subject in several computer science curricula. Besides computer scientists, Chaitin&#x27;s work draws attention of many philosophers and mathematicians to fundamental problems in mathematical creativity and digital philosophy.

==Mathematics and computer science==
Gregory Chaitin is Jewish. He attended the Bronx High School of Science and the City College of New York, where he (still in his teens) developed the theory that led to his independent discovery of algorithmic complexity.

Chaitin has defined Chaitin&#x27;s constant Ω, a real number whose digits are equidistributed and which is sometimes informally described as an expression of the probability that a random program will halt. Ω has the mathematical property that it is definable, with asymptotic approximations from below (but not from above), but not computable.

Chaitin is also the originator of using graph coloring to do register allocation in compiling, a process known as Chaitin&#x27;s algorithm.

He was formerly a researcher at IBM&#x27;s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York. He has written more than 10 books that have been translated to about 15 languages. He is today interested in questions of metabiology and information-theoretic formalizations of the theory of evolution, and is a member of the Institute for Advanced Studies at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University.

==Other scholarly contributions==
Chaitin also writes about philosophy, especially metaphysics and philosophy of mathematics (particularly about epistemological matters in mathematics). In metaphysics, Chaitin claims that algorithmic information theory is the key to solving problems in the field of biology (obtaining a formal definition of &#x27;life&#x27;, its origin and evolution) and neuroscience (the problem of consciousness and the study of the mind).

In recent writings, he defends a position known as digital philosophy. In the epistemology of mathematics, he claims that his findings in mathematical logic and algorithmic information theory show there are &quot;mathematical facts that are true for no reason, that are true by accident&quot;. Chaitin proposes that mathematicians must abandon any hope of proving those mathematical facts and adopt a quasi-empirical methodology.

==Honors==
In 1995 he was given the degree of doctor of science &quot;honoris causa&quot; by the University of Maine. In 2002 he was given the title of honorary professor by the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina, where his parents were born and where Chaitin spent part of his youth. In 2007 he was given a Leibniz Medal by Wolfram Research. In 2009 he was given the degree of doctor of philosophy &quot;honoris causa&quot; by the National University of Córdoba. He was formerly a researcher at IBM&#x27;s Thomas J. Watson Research Center and a professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.

<text>Goran Bregović (; born 22 March 1950) is a recording artist born in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He is one of the most internationally known modern musicians and composers of the Slavic speaking countries in the Balkans, and one of the few former Yugoslav musicians who has performed at major international venues such as Carnegie Hall, Royal Albert Hall and L&#x27;Olympia.

A Sarajevo native, Bregović started out with the bands Kodeksi and Jutro, but rose to prominence as the main creative mind and lead guitarist of Bijelo Dugme, widely considered one of the most popular and influential recording acts ever to exist in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After Bijelo Dugme split up, he embarked on several critically and commercially successful solo projects, and started composing film scores. Among his better known film scores are three of Emir Kusturica&#x27;s films (&quot;Time of the Gypsies&quot;, &quot;Arizona Dream&quot; and &quot;Underground&quot;). For &quot;Time of the Gypsies&quot;, Bregović won a Golden Arena Award at the Pula Film Festival in 1990, among other awards. He has also composed for the Academy Award-nominated film &quot;La Reine Margot&quot; and the Cannes-entered film &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Kiss&quot;.

During his five-decade long career, Bregović has composed for critically acclaimed singers, including Sezen Aksu, Kayah, Iggy Pop, Šaban Bajramović, George Dalaras and Cesária Évora.

==Early life==
Born in Sarajevo, PR Bosnia-Herzegovina, FPR Yugoslavia to a Croatian father Franjo Bregović and Serbian mother Borka Perišić, Goran grew up with two younger siblings — sister Dajana and brother Predrag. Their father was from the Croatian region of Prigorje, specifically Sveti Petar Čvrstec village near Križevci, while their mother was born in Virovitica to parents that had shortly before her birth arrived in the nearby village of Čemernica, settling there from the village of Kazanci near Gacko in East Herzegovina.

Goran&#x27;s maternal grandfather fought in the Royal Serbian Army at the Salonica front during World War I and as a reward received land in Slavonia where he soon moved his family. When the Second World War began, Goran&#x27;s grandfather joined the partisans, and his grandmother, two uncles, aunt and mother were taken to the Jasenovac Concentration Camp; where at the gate of the camp they were exchanged for some captured Germans. The family arrived in Serbia whilst his grandmother supported the children throughout the war by smuggling tobacco from Herzegovina. She jumped off the train before entering the Belgrade train station. Goran&#x27;s maternal uncle was Serb priest and Chetnik leader Radojica Perišić (1906 - April 1945), one of the main leaders of the June 1941 uprising in eastern Herzegovina during the World War II. During the war he was commander of the Chetnik Gacko Brigade who were the first guerrilla force in all of nazi-occupied Europe to liberate territory. Perišić was killed by the Ustaše in April 1945.

Franjo Bregović fought on the Partisan side during the World War II. After the war he attended a Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) military school in Virovitica, where he met Goran&#x27;s mother, Borka, shortly after the war. Franjo Bregović soon got his first job, teaching ballistics at a military school in Sarajevo, so the couple moved there. Goran, their first child, was born in 1950 in Sarajevo.

Goran was 10 years old when his parents divorced. In later interviews, he mentioned his father&#x27;s alcoholism as the reason for the breakdown of their marriage. Soon after the split, his father moved to Livno, taking Goran&#x27;s younger brother Predrag with him while Goran remained living with his mother in Sarajevo, visiting his father and brother every summer in Livno. Their father soon retired and eventually moved back to his home village in Zagorje while Goran&#x27;s brother Predrag later moved back to Sarajevo for university studies.

Goran played violin in a music school. However, deemed untalented, he was thrown out during second grade. His musical education was thus reduced to what his friend taught him until Goran&#x27;s mother bought him his first guitar in his early teens. Bregović wanted to enroll in a fine arts high school, but his aunt told his mother that it was supposedly full of homosexuals, which precipitated his mother&#x27;s decision to send him to a technical (traffic) school. As a compromise for not getting his way, she allowed him to grow his hair long.

==Early career==
Upon entering high school, teenage Bregović joined the school band Izohipse where he began on bass guitar. Soon, however, he was kicked out of that school too (this time for misbehavior – he crashed into a school-owned Mercedes-Benz). Bregović then entered grammar school and its school band Beštije (again as a bass guitar player). When he was 16, his mother left him and moved to the coast, meaning that other than having a few relatives to rely on, he mostly had to take care of himself. He did that by playing folk music in a kafana in Konjic, working on construction sites, and selling newspapers.

Spotting him at a Beštije gig in 1969, Željko Bebek invited eighteen-year-old Bregović to play bass guitar in his band Kodeksi, which Goran gladly accepted.

===Kodeksi===
Eventually, Kodeksi shifted setup so Bregović moved from bass to lead guitar, resulting in Kodeksi having the following line-up during summer 1970: Goran Bregović, Željko Bebek, Zoran Redžić and Milić Vukašinović. All of them would eventually become members of Bijelo Dugme at some point in the future. At the time, they were largely influenced by Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. During the fall of 1970, this resulted in the departure of Željko Bebek, who (both as rhythm guitar player and singer) got phased out of the band. At the end of the year, Goran&#x27;s mother and Zoran&#x27;s brother arrived in Naples and took them back to Sarajevo.

===Jutro===
Then, in the autumn of 1971, Bregović enrolled at the University of Sarajevo&#x27;s Faculty of Philosophy, studying philosophy and sociology. He soon quit, however. At the same time, Milić Vukašinović left for London, so Bregović formed a band with Nuno Arnautalić called Jutro (Morning), which Redžić soon joined as well. Over the next few years, the band changed lineups frequently, and on 1 January 1974 modified its name to Bijelo Dugme (&quot;White Button&quot;).

==Bijelo Dugme==

From 1974 until 1989, Bregović played lead guitar and was the main creative force behind Bijelo Dugme (&quot;White Button&quot;). For years they stood as one of the most popular bands in SFR Yugoslavia. Just as with Jutro previously, he continued as Bijelo Dugme&#x27;s undisputed leader and decision-maker as well as its public face in the Yugoslav print and electronic media once the band started taking off commercially.

Over the band&#x27;s fifteen-year run, in addition to their enormous popularity at home, led by Bregović, Bijelo Dugme made several attempts at expanding their prominence outside of Yugoslavia. In late 1975, while recording their second album &quot;Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu&quot; in London, they additionally recorded an English language track called &quot;Playing the Part&quot; (translated version of their Serbo-Croatian track &quot;Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu&quot;, itself an uncredited cover of Argent&#x27;s 1972 track &quot;I Am the Dance of Ages&quot;) that was packaged as a promo single for English music journalists. Never officially released for mass distribution, the track quickly fell into oblivion.

Bijelo Dugme had somewhat better luck with touring abroad, which almost entirely took place in the Eastern Bloc countries as part of their respective cultural exchange programs with SFR Yugoslavia. The band briefly toured the Polish People&#x27;s Republic during April 1977, a 9-concert leg as part of the tour in support of their third album &quot;Eto! Baš hoću!&quot;. During their 10-day Polish tour, the band played two concerts on back-to-back nights in Warsaw, followed by Olsztyn, Zielona Góra, three shows on back-to-back days in Poznań, and finally two shows on the same day in Kalisz. While in Poland, they also shot a 30-minute television special for TVP3 Katowice, a regional Katowice-based branch of the state-owned Telewizja Polska. Later that year, following the tour&#x27;s culmination at a triumphant open-air concert at Hajdučka Česma in Belgrade, Bregović went to serve his mandatory Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) stint. Assigned to a Niš-based unit, the twenty-seven-year-old reported for service on 3 November 1977 and would spend the following year away from music, a period during which the band was also on hiatus.

During early 1982, as part of an event bringing together past and future Winter Olympic hosts, the band played in Innsbruck, Austria as representatives of the city of Sarajevo and SFR Yugoslavia, the site of the upcoming Winter Olympics. On return to Yugoslavia from Innsbruck, the band had its baggage confiscated by the Yugoslav customs after undeclared musical equipment was found among their luggage. Some six months later, during summer 1982, Bijelo Dugme went on an impromptu tour of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria, playing 41 shows throughout the country from 15 July until 31 August 1982. Despite the tour in support of their latest studio album &quot;Doživjeti stotu&quot; being over for more than a year, and having no new material to promote, the band reportedly accepted the tour of Bulgaria in order to recover some of the funds they had lost after getting fined by the Yugoslav customs over the attempt to bring undeclared musical equipment into the country.

In summer 1985, following a decade of continuous rejection for tours of the Soviet Union by the cultural attaché of the Soviet embassy in Yugoslavia, Bijelo Dugme was finally approved and booked to play in Moscow on 28 July 1985, on the same bill with fellow Yugoslav rock act Bajaga i Instruktori, at a huge open-air concert at Gorky Park as part of the 12th World Festival of Youth and Students. Ahead of the show, Bregović decided to sequester the band in Budva for two weeks in order to rehearse for the Moscow show, an indication of the seriousness with which they approached this particular concert. However, once in Moscow, due to overcrowding at Gorky Park and resulting safety concerns, the event was interrupted around 10 p.m. after the Bajaga i Instruktori set before Bijelo Dugme even had a chance to take the stage. Two days later on 30 July 1985, instead at the marquee Gorky Park in central Moscow, Bijelo Dugme got to play the Dynamo Arena on the city outskirts at an unpopular noon-hour time slot.

===Guest appearances, collaborations and business venture===
In between Bijelo Dugme&#x27;s studio releases and tours, in-demand Bregović worked on various side projects in Yugoslavia. These included releasing a solo record in 1976 and composing two movie soundtracks—1977&#x27;s &quot;Leptirov oblak&quot; and 1979&#x27;s &quot;Lične stvari&quot;.

He also tried his hand at music production, producing Idoli&#x27;s 1980 seven-inch single &quot;Maljčiki&quot; / &quot;Retko te viđam sa devojkama&quot; and co-producing, alongside Kornelije Kovač, Zdravko Čolić&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Malo pojačaj radio&quot; in 1981.

Bregović furthermore made guest appearances on guitar on various studio recordings by different Yugoslav pop, folk, and rock acts: Neda Ukraden&#x27;s track &quot;Tri djevojke&quot; (together with Bijelo Dugme bandmates Vlado Pravdić and Zoran Redžić) off her 1976 album &quot;Ko me to od nekud doziva&quot;, Hanka Paldum&#x27;s track &quot;Zbog tebe&quot; off her 1980 album &quot;Čežnja&quot;, &quot;Ne da/ne nego i/ili&quot; track by Kozmetika off their 1983 eponymous album, Valentino&#x27;s track &quot;Pazi na ritam&quot; off their 1983 debut album &quot;ValentiNo1&quot;, Riblja Čorba&#x27;s track &quot;Disko mišić&quot; off their 1985 album &quot;Istina&quot;, Merlin&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Teško meni sa tobom (a još teže bez tebe)&quot;, Mjesečari track &quot;Gdje izlaziš ovih dana&quot; off their 1988 album &quot;One šetaju od 1 do 2&quot;, and Piloti track &quot;Tiho, tiho&quot; off their 1990 album &quot;Nek te Bog čuva za mene&quot;.

During his time leading Bijelo Dugme, Bregović also became involved in the financial and organizational side of the music business. In 1984, dissatisfied with their respective financial terms at the state-owned Jugoton label, Bijelo Dugme bandleader Bregović and one of Yugoslavia&#x27;s biggest pop stars Zdravko Čolić got together to establish their own music label Kamarad, which—via a deal with state-owned Diskoton and later another newly established private label Komuna—would end up co-releasing all of Bijelo Dugme&#x27;s subsequent studio albums including three of Čolić&#x27;s studio albums from 1984 until 1990. Considered an unusual move at the time in a communist country with nearly across-the-board public ownership that had just recently began allowing certain modes of private entrepreneurship, starting a privately owned record label—combined with Bregović&#x27;s and Čolić&#x27;s high public profile in Yugoslavia—got them both a lot of additional attention in the country&#x27;s press. The company was registered in Radomlje near Domžale in SR Slovenia. Due to not having its own production facilities and distribution network, the new label entered into a co-releasing agreement with Diskoton thus essentially functioning as the legal entity that holds the licensing rights to the works of Bijelo Dugme and Zdravko Čolić. Kamarad&#x27;s debut co-release was Čolić&#x27;s 1984 studio album &quot;Ti si mi u krvi&quot; followed by Bijelo Dugme&#x27;s self-titled studio album later that year with new vocalist Mladen &quot;Tifa&quot; Vojičić. The label would also co-release many of Dugme&#x27;s and Čolić&#x27;s later &#x27;best of&#x27; compilations in addition to Bregović&#x27;s movie soundtrack albums as well as Vesna Zmijanac&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Ako me umiriš sad&quot;.

==Solo career==
During the late 1980s, a period that would turn out to be the final years of Bijelo Dugme, Bregović entered the world of film music. His first project was Emir Kusturica&#x27;s &quot;Time of the Gypsies&quot; (1989) and it turned out to be a great success (both the film and the soundtrack). Bregović&#x27;s collaboration with Kusturica continued as the musician composed the soundtrack (which was performed by Iggy Pop) for Kusturica&#x27;s next film &quot;Arizona Dream&quot; (1993). During the Bosnian War, Bregović relocated to Paris, but also lived in Belgrade. His next major project, music for Patrice Chéreau&#x27;s &quot;Queen Margot&quot; was a great success as well, and as a result, the film won two awards on the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. The next year&#x27;s Golden Palm award went to &quot;Underground&quot;, for which Goran Bregović composed the music.

In 1997, he worked with Turkish singer Sezen Aksu on her album &quot;Düğün ve Cenaze&quot; (&quot;Wedding and Funeral&quot;). After that album, he continued making composite albums with other musicians that were based on his music and singers&#x27; lyrics.

He made an album with George Dalaras in 1999 named &quot;Thessaloniki – Yannena with Two Canvas Shoes&quot;. In the same year, Bregović recorded an album called &quot;Kayah i Bregović&quot; (Kayah and Bregović) with popular Polish singer Kayah which sold over 700,000 copies in Poland (seven times platinum record).

In 2001, he recorded another album with another Polish singer, Krzysztof Krawczyk, titled &quot;Daj mi drugie życie&quot; (&quot;Give Me Second Life&quot;).

In 2005, Bregović took part in three large farewell concerts of Bijelo Dugme.

A number of works created by Bregović can be heard on the soundtrack to the 2006 film &quot;&quot;, most notably &quot;Đurđevdan&quot;. The film itself actually features more Bregović samples than the soundtrack.

Two musical numbers by Bregović, &quot;Ne Siam Kurve Tuke Sijam Prostitutke,&quot; and &quot;Gas, Gas&quot; were featured in the soundtrack of the 2012 Brazilian telenovela, &quot;Salve Jorge&quot;, on the television network Rede Globo.

===Wedding and Funeral Orchestra===
For many years Bregović performed with a large ensemble of musicians: a brass band, bagpipes, a string ensemble, a tuxedo-clad all-male choir from Belgrade, women wearing traditional Bulgarian costumes, and Roma singers make up his 40-piece band and orchestra.

Since 1998, and until about 2012, Bregović has been performing his music mainly in the form of concerts all over the world with his Wedding and Funeral Orchestra. This consists of 10 people (in the small version) or 37 (in the large version, although, in some instances, this number varies, depending on participants from the host country).

Since 2012 the orchestra consists of 9 people (in the small version) or 19 (in the large version), as it played in New York at the Lincoln Center on 15 and 16 July 2016.

The small orchestra consists of Muharem &quot;Muki&quot; Rexhepi (vocals, drums), Bokan Stanković (first trumpet), Dragić Velićović (second trumpet), Stojan Dimov (sax, clarinet), Aleksandar Rajković (first trombone, glockenspiel), Miloš Mihajlović (second trombone), female vocals Bulgarian singers Daniela Radkova-Aleksandrova and Ljudmila Radkova-Trajkova, and Goran himself. 
The large orchestra includes also string quartet: Ivana Mateijć (first violin), Bojana Jovanović-Jotić (second violin), Saša Mirković (viola), and Tatjana Jovanović-Mirković, as well as sextet of male voices: Dejan Pesić (first tenor), Milan Panić and Ranko Jović (second tenors), Aleksandar Novaković (baritone), Dušan Ljubinković and Siniša Dutina (basses).

In previous years, in the orchestra the following musicians have performed: Ogi Radivojević and Alen Ademović (vocals, drums), Dalibor Lukić (second trumpet), Dejan Manigodić (tuba), Vaska Jankovska (vocals).

In 2013, as part of his Asia-Pacific tour (including Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong), Bregović performed with a string quartet, a male choir, Bulgarian singers and half of a brass band. The other part of the brass band – including bass and percussions – were being played from his computer. In 2017, he was a guest artist on Puerto Rican rapper Residente&#x27;s album &quot;Residente&quot; on the song &quot;El Futuro Es Nuestro&quot; (Spanish for &quot;The Future is Ours&quot;).

===Eurovision===
During the Eurovision 2008 final in Belgrade Arena, Serbia, he played as the interval act. He also composed the Serbian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010; &#x27;Ovo Je Balkan&#x27; sung by Milan Stanković.

==Musical style==
Bregović&#x27;s compositions, extending Balkan musical inspirations to innovative extremes, draw upon European classicism and Balkan rhythms.

Bregović&#x27;s music carries: Yugoslav, Bulgarian, Romani, Greek, Romanian, Albanian, Italian, Turkish and Polish themes and is a fusion of popular music, with traditional polyphonic music from the Balkans, tango and brass bands.

==Personal life==
During the early 1970s, from a brief relationship with a Sarajevo-based dancer named Jasenka, Bregović&#x27;s first child, daughter Željka, was born out of wedlock. Željka lives in Austria where she gave birth to Goran&#x27;s granddaughter, Bianca.

With Bijelo Dugme&#x27;s mid-1970s breakout commercial success and Bregović&#x27;s increased public profile in Yugoslavia, details of his lifestyle and romantic relationships also became fodder for the country&#x27;s press. Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, various Yugoslav print media outlets documented his high-profile relationship with Serbian model Ljiljana Tica who reportedly inspired his song &quot;Bitanga i princeza&quot; off Bijelo Dugme&#x27;s eponymous 1979 album.

In 1993, Bregović married his long-time girlfriend Dženana Sudžuka, a Bosniak model. The wedding ceremony held in Paris featured film director Emir Kusturica as the groom&#x27;s best man and longtime Bijelo Dugme backing vocal Amila Sulejmanović as the bride&#x27;s maid of honour.

The couple has three daughters: Ema (born in March 1995), Una (February 2002), and Lulu (May 2004). Since the early 1990s, when not touring, Bregović&#x27;s primary residence has been in Paris, a city where he got married and his three daughters were born and raised. Additionally, he spends a lot of time in Belgrade where he does most of his musical work. During the 2000s, answering a question about where his home is, Bregović said: &quot;If you define &#x27;home&#x27; as the place where you keep your winter coat during summer and your swimming trunks during winter, then my home is my Paris apartment&quot;.

On 12 June 2008, fifty-eight-year-old Bregović sustained a spinal injury in Belgrade, breaking vertebrae by falling four meters from a cherry tree in the garden of his Senjak house. After being assessed by doctors, his condition was stated to be &quot;stable without neurological complications.&quot; Following surgery, he made a quick recovery and, within a month on 8 and 9 July, held two big concerts in New York City, proving for more than two hours each night his performance skills had not suffered from the accident.

Bregović&#x27;s siblings, brother Predrag and sister Dajana, live in New York City and Split, respectively.

===Political views===

In 1971, twenty-one-year-old Bregović—a student at the University of Sarajevo&#x27;s Faculty of Philosophy—got accepted into the Yugoslav Communist League (SKJ), the only party in SFR Yugoslavia&#x27;s political system.

Throughout the mid-to-late 1970s, by now a famous rock musician in SFR Yugoslavia, Bregović often publicly expressed personal support for the communist ideology while underscoring importance of being active in the party.

In 1990—with the dissolution of the SKJ and reinstatement of multi-party political system in Yugoslavia—Bregović expressed public support for Ante Marković&#x27;s Union of Reform Forces of Yugoslavia (SRSJ), a centre-left social-democrat political party opposing ethnic nationalism and advocating for reform of Yugoslav communism into liberal market capitalism. Furthermore, he actively participated in the party&#x27;s election campaign ahead of the general elections in the SR Bosnia and Herzegovina constituent unit of SFR Yugoslavia, lending his celebrity and contributing to the campaign in creative capacity. Despite securing public support, endorsements, and even active campaign participation from many prominent public figures in SR Bosnia and Herzegovina such as Emir Kusturica, Nele Karajlić, Branko Đurić, etc., the party got only 8.9% of the total vote.

On 2 April 1999—a week into the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia—alongside Greek performers George Dalaras, Stavros Kouyioumtzis, and Alkistis Protopsalti as well as a number of others from different parts of the Balkans, Bregović played at an anti-war open-air concert at Thessaloniki&#x27;s Aristotelous Square.

In the years following the Yugoslav Wars and breakup of Yugoslavia, Bregović has described himself as Yugonostalgic. In 2009, he stated: &quot;Yugoslavia is the intersection of so many worlds: Orthodox, Catholic, Muslim. With music, I don&#x27;t have to represent anyone, except myself – because I speak the first language of the world, the one everyone understands: music.&quot;

===Real estate===
Bregović owns real estate all over the world, but divides most of his time between Belgrade where he does most of his musical recording work and Paris where his spouse lives with their three daughters.

He reportedly owns properties in Paris, Istanbul, Belgrade, Zagreb, on Mount Jahorina, and Perast, many of which are used for commercial purposes such as touristic rentals, studio recording, and filming locations.

In Belgrade, Bregović owns multiple properties in the upscale Senjak neighbourhood. Some of his Belgrade properties in the neighbourhoods of Senjak and Dedinje were leased out as shooting locations for Serbian television series &#x27;, &#x27;, and &quot;&quot;.

==Controversy==
Bregović has frequently been accused of plagiarizing other performers&#x27; works, as well as republishing his own previously released material as new.

===Enrico Macias plagiarism lawsuit===
In the mid-2000s, French singer-songwriter Enrico Macias reportedly sued Bregović over Bregović&#x27;s song &quot;In the Deathcar&quot; off the &quot;Arizona Dream&quot; soundtrack album, claiming it plagiarized Macias&#x27; song &quot;Solenzara&quot;. Media outlets in the Balkans reported in 2015 that the French court ruled in Macias&#x27; favour, ordering Bregović to pay Macias €1 million in damages.

In response, via a press release distributed to media outlets throughout the Balkans, Bregović&#x27;s representative Svetlana Strunić claimed that there never was a plagiarism court process against Bregović in France.

===2015 cancelled concert in Poland===
In March 2015, Bregović performed a concert in Crimea after it was annexed by Russia in the previous year. The following month, the Life Festival in Oświęcim, Poland canceled an appearance by Bregović, saying that his statements were &quot;contrary to the values cherished by the Life Festival founders.&quot;

===2023 denial of entry into Moldova===
Because of his open support for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the 2015 performance in Crimea, in August 2023, Bregović was denied from entering Moldova. He intended to play in a music festival in the country.

<doc id="12312" wikidata="Q28627" url="?curid=12312" title="Gestation">
<text>Gestation is the period of development during the carrying of an embryo, and later fetus, inside viviparous animals (the embryo develops within the parent). It is typical for mammals, but also occurs for some non-mammals. Mammals during pregnancy can have one or more gestations at the same time, for example in a multiple birth.

The time interval of a gestation is called the &quot;gestation period&quot;. In obstetrics, &quot;gestational age&quot; refers to the time since the onset of the last menses, which on average is fertilization age plus two weeks.

==Mammals==
In mammals, pregnancy begins when a zygote (fertilized ovum) implants in the female&#x27;s uterus and ends once the fetus leaves the uterus during labor or an abortion (whether induced or spontaneous).

===Humans===
In humans, pregnancy can be defined clinically, biochemically or biologically. Clinically, pregnancy starts from first day of the mother&#x27;s last period. Biochemically, pregnancy starts when a woman&#x27;s human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels rise above 25 mIU/mL. Biologically, pregnancy starts at implantation of the fertilized egg.

Human pregnancy can be divided into three trimesters, each approximately three months long: the first, second, and third trimester. The first trimester is from the last menstrual period through the 13th week, the second trimester is 14th–28/29th week, and the third trimester is 29/30th–42nd week. Birth normally occurs at a gestational age of about 40 weeks, though it is common for births to occur from 37 to 42 weeks. Labor occurring prior to 37 weeks gestation is considered preterm labor and can result from multiple factors, including previous preterm deliveries.

Prenatal care is important for the maintenance of a healthy pregnancy and surveillance of related complications. In high-income countries, prenatal care typically involves monthly visits during the first two trimesters, with an increasing number of visits closer to delivery. At these visits, healthcare providers will evaluate a variety of parental and fetal metrics, including fetal growth and heart rate, birth defects, maternal blood pressure, among others.

After birth, health care providers will measure the baby&#x27;s weight, vital signs, reflexes, head circumference, muscle tone, and posture to help determine the gestational age.

Various factors can influence the duration of gestation, including diseases in pregnancy and adequate prenatal care. The rates of morbidity and pre-existing diseases that predispose mothers to life-threatening, pregnancy-related complications in the United States are increasing. Inaccessibility of prenatal care may partially explain this ongoing disparity. 

===Placental mammals===

During gestation in placental mammals, there is a gradual physiological increase in senescence in the maternal decidua (the specialized layer of endometrium that forms the base of the placental bed) and in placental cells. This increase in senescence is associated with a gradual physiological increase in DNA damage during gestation. A positive correlation between the gestation period and maximum lifespan was observed across 740 mammalian species. It was postulated that the rates of DNA damage and senescence may impact the gestation period as well as lifespan.

==Non-mammals==

In viviparous animals, the embryo develops inside the body of the mother, as opposed to outside in an egg (oviparity). The mother then gives live birth. The less developed form of viviparity is called ovoviviparity, in which the mother carries embryos inside eggs. Most vipers exhibit ovoviviparity. The more developed form of viviparity is called placental viviparity; mammals are the best example, but it has also evolved independently in other animals, such as in scorpions, some sharks, and in velvet worms. Viviparous offspring live independently and require an external food supply from birth. Certain lizards also employ this method such as the genera &quot;Tiliqua&quot; and &quot;Corucia.&quot; The placenta is attached directly to the mother in these lizards which is called viviparous matrotrophy.

Ovoviviparous animals develop within eggs that remain within the mother&#x27;s body up until they hatch or are about to hatch. It is similar to viviparity in that the embryo develops within the mother&#x27;s body. Unlike the embryos of viviparous species, ovoviviparous embryos are nourished by the egg yolk rather than by the mother&#x27;s body. However, the mother&#x27;s body does provide gas exchange. The young of ovoviviparous amphibians are sometimes born as larvae, and undergo metamorphosis outside the body of the mother.

The fish family Syngnathidae has the unique characteristic whereby females lay their eggs in a brood pouch on the male&#x27;s chest, and the male incubates the eggs. Fertilization may take place in the pouch or before implantation in the water. Included in Syngnathidae are seahorses, the pipefish, and the weedy and leafy sea dragons. Syngnathidae is the only family in the animal kingdom to which the term &quot;male pregnancy&quot; has been applied.

<doc id="12316" wikidata="Q190573" url="?curid=12316" title="Gamma function">
<text>In mathematics, the gamma function (represented by Γ, capital Greek letter gamma) is the most common extension of the factorial function to complex numbers. Derived by Daniel Bernoulli, the gamma function formula_1 is defined for all complex numbers formula_2 except non-positive integers, and for every positive integer formula_3, formula_4The gamma function can be defined via a convergent improper integral for complex numbers with positive real part:

formula_5The gamma function then is defined in the complex plane as the analytic continuation of this integral function: it is a meromorphic function which is holomorphic except at zero and the negative integers, where it has simple poles.

The gamma function has no zeros, so the reciprocal gamma function is an entire function. In fact, the gamma function corresponds to the Mellin transform of the negative exponential function:

formula_6

Other extensions of the factorial function do exist, but the gamma function is the most popular and useful. It appears as a factor in various probability-distribution functions and other formulas in the fields of probability, statistics, analytic number theory, and combinatorics.

== Motivation ==
The gamma function can be seen as a solution to the interpolation problem of finding a smooth curve formula_7 that connects the points of the factorial sequence: formula_8 for all positive integer values of formula_9. The simple formula for the factorial, is only valid when is a positive integer, and no elementary function has this property, but a good solution is the gamma function formula_10.

The gamma function is not only smooth but analytic (except at the non-positive integers), and it can be defined in several explicit ways. However, it is not the only analytic function that extends the factorial, as one may add any analytic function that is zero on the positive integers, such as formula_11 for an integer formula_12. Such a function is known as a pseudogamma function, the most famous being the Hadamard function.

A more restrictive requirement is the functional equation which interpolates the shifted factorial formula_13 :
formula_14

But this still does not give a unique solution, since it allows for multiplication by any periodic function formula_15 with formula_16 and formula_17, such as formula_18. 

One way to resolve the ambiguity is the Bohr–Mollerup theorem, which shows that formula_19 is the unique interpolating function for the factorial, defined over the positive reals, which is logarithmically convex, meaning that formula_20 is convex.

== Definition ==

=== Main definition ===
The notation formula_21 is due to Legendre. If the real part of the complex number  is strictly positive (formula_22), then the integral
formula_23
converges absolutely, and is known as the Euler integral of the second kind. (Euler&#x27;s integral of the first kind is the beta function.) Using integration by parts, one sees that:

formula_24

Recognizing that formula_25 as formula_26
formula_27

Then can be calculated as:
formula_28

Thus we can show that formula_29 for any positive integer by induction. Specifically, the base case is that formula_30, and the induction step is that formula_31

The identity formula_32 can be used (or, yielding the same result, analytic continuation can be used) to uniquely extend the integral formulation for formula_21 to a meromorphic function defined for all complex numbers , except integers less than or equal to zero. It is this extended version that is commonly referred to as the gamma function.

=== Alternative definitions ===
There are many equivalent definitions.

==== Euler&#x27;s definition as an infinite product ====
For a fixed integer formula_12, as the integer formula_9 increases, we have that
formula_36

If formula_12 is not an integer, then this equation is meaningless, since in this section the factorial of a non-integer has not been defined yet. However, let us assume that this equation continues to hold when formula_12 is replaced by an arbitrary complex number formula_2, in order to define the Gamma function for non integers:

formula_40
Multiplying both sides by formula_41 gives
formula_42This infinite product, which is due to Euler, converges for all complex numbers formula_2 except the non-positive integers, which fail because of a division by zero. In fact, the above assumption produces a unique definition of formula_1 as .

Intuitively, this formula indicates that formula_1 is approximately the result of computing formula_46 for some large integer formula_9, multiplying by formula_48 to approximate formula_49, and using the relationship formula_50 backwards formula_51 times to get an approximation for formula_1; and furthermore that this approximation becomes exact as formula_9 increases to infinity.

The infinite product for the reciprocal
formula_54
is an entire function, converging for every complex number .

==== Weierstrass&#x27;s definition ====
The definition for the gamma function due to Weierstrass is also valid for all complex numbers formula_2 except non-positive integers:
formula_56
where formula_57 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. This is the Hadamard product of formula_58 in a rewritten form. This definition appears in an important identity involving pi.
Equivalence of the integral definition and Weierstrass definition

By the integral definition, the relation formula_59 and Hadamard factorization theorem,
formula_60
for some constants formula_61 since formula_62 is an entire function of order formula_63. Since formula_64 as formula_65, formula_66 (or an integer multiple of formula_67) and since formula_68,
formula_69
where formula_70 for some integer formula_71. Since formula_72 for formula_73, we have formula_74 and
formula_75

Equivalence of the Weierstrass definition and Euler definition

formula_76
Let
formula_77
and
formula_78
Then
formula_79
and
formula_80
therefore
formula_81
Then
formula_82
and taking formula_83 gives the desired result.
== Properties ==

=== General ===

Besides the fundamental property discussed above:
formula_84
other important functional equations for the gamma function are Euler&#x27;s reflection formula
formula_85
which implies
formula_86
and the Legendre duplication formula
formula_87
Proof 1

With Euler&#x27;s infinite product
formula_88 compute
formula_89
where the last equality is a known result. A similar derivation begins with Weierstrass&#x27;s definition.

Proof 2

First prove that
formula_90
Consider the positively oriented rectangular contour formula_91 with vertices at formula_92, formula_93, formula_94 and formula_95 where formula_96. Then by the residue theorem,
formula_97
Let
formula_98
and let formula_99 be the analogous integral over the top side of the rectangle. Then formula_100 as formula_101 and formula_102. If formula_103 denotes the right vertical side of the rectangle, then
formula_104
for some constant formula_105 and since formula_106, the integral tends to formula_107 as formula_101. Analogously, the integral over the left vertical side of the rectangle tends to formula_107 as formula_101. Therefore
formula_111
from which
formula_112
Then
formula_113
and
formula_114
Proving the reflection formula for all formula_115 proves it for all formula_116 by analytic continuation.


The beta function can be represented as
formula_117

Setting formula_118 yields
formula_119

After the substitution formula_120:
formula_121

The function formula_122 is even, hence
formula_123

Now assume
formula_124

Then
formula_125

This implies
formula_126

Since
formula_127
the Legendre duplication formula follows:
formula_128

The duplication formula is a special case of the multiplication theorem (see  Eq. 5.5.6):
formula_129

A simple but useful property, which can be seen from the limit definition, is:
formula_130

In particular, with , this product is
formula_131

If the real part is an integer or a half-integer, this can be finitely expressed in closed form:
formula_132

First, consider the reflection formula applied to formula_133.
formula_134
Applying the recurrence relation to the second term:
formula_135
which with simple rearrangement gives
formula_136

Second, consider the reflection formula applied to formula_137.
formula_138

Formulas for other values of formula_2 for which the real part is integer or half-integer quickly follow by induction using the recurrence relation in the positive and negative directions.

Perhaps the best-known value of the gamma function at a non-integer argument is
formula_140
which can be found by setting formula_141 in the reflection or duplication formulas, by using the relation to the beta function given below with formula_142, or simply by making the substitution formula_143 in the integral definition of the gamma function, resulting in a Gaussian integral. In general, for non-negative integer values of formula_9 we have:
formula_145
where the double factorial formula_146. See Particular values of the gamma function for calculated values.

It might be tempting to generalize the result that formula_147 by looking for a formula for other individual values formula_148 where formula_149 is rational, especially because according to Gauss&#x27;s digamma theorem, it is possible to do so for the closely related digamma function at every rational value. However, these numbers formula_148 are not known to be expressible by themselves in terms of elementary functions. It has been proved that formula_151 is a transcendental number and algebraically independent of formula_152 for any integer formula_9 and each of the fractions formula_154. In general, when computing values of the gamma function, we must settle for numerical approximations.

The derivatives of the gamma function are described in terms of the polygamma function, :
formula_155
For a positive integer  the derivative of the gamma function can be calculated as follows:

formula_156
where H(m) is the mth harmonic number and is the Euler–Mascheroni constant.

For formula_157 the formula_9th derivative of the gamma function is:
formula_159
(This can be derived by differentiating the integral form of the gamma function with respect to formula_2, and using the technique of differentiation under the integral sign.)

Using the identity
formula_161
where formula_162 is the Riemann zeta function, and formula_163 is the formula_9-th Bell polynomial, we have in particular the Laurent series expansion of the gamma function 
formula_165

=== Inequalities ===
When restricted to the positive real numbers, the gamma function is a strictly logarithmically convex function. This property may be stated in any of the following three equivalent ways:
* For any two positive real numbers formula_166 and formula_167, and for any formula_168, formula_169
* For any two positive real numbers formula_166 and formula_167, and formula_167 &gt; formula_166formula_174
* For any positive real number formula_175, formula_176
The last of these statements is, essentially by definition, the same as the statement that formula_177, where formula_178 is the polygamma function of order 1. To prove the logarithmic convexity of the gamma function, it therefore suffices to observe that formula_178 has a series representation which, for positive real , consists of only positive terms.

Logarithmic convexity and Jensen&#x27;s inequality together imply, for any positive real numbers formula_180 and formula_181,
formula_182

There are also bounds on ratios of gamma functions. The best-known is Gautschi&#x27;s inequality, which says that for any positive real number and any ,
formula_183

=== Stirling&#x27;s formula ===

The behavior of formula_184 for an increasing positive real variable is given by Stirling&#x27;s formula
formula_185
where the symbol formula_186 means asymptotic convergence: the ratio of the two sides converges to 1 in the limit This growth is faster than exponential, formula_187, for any fixed value of formula_188.

Another useful limit for asymptotic approximations for formula_189 is:
formula_190

When writing the error term as an infinite product, Stirling&#x27;s formula can be used to define the gamma function: 
formula_191

=== Extension to negative, non-integer values ===
Although the main definition of the gamma function—the Euler integral of the second kind—is only valid (on the real axis) for positive arguments, its domain can be extended with analytic continuation to negative arguments by shifting the negative argument to positive values by using either the Euler&#x27;s reflection formula,
formula_192
or the fundamental property,
formula_193
when formula_194. 
For example,
formula_195

=== Residues ===
The behavior for non-positive formula_2 is more intricate. Euler&#x27;s integral does not converge for but the function it defines in the positive complex half-plane has a unique analytic continuation to the negative half-plane. One way to find that analytic continuation is to use Euler&#x27;s integral for positive arguments and extend the domain to negative numbers by repeated application of the recurrence formula,
formula_197
choosing formula_9 such that formula_199 is positive. The product in the denominator is zero when formula_2 equals any of the integers formula_201. Thus, the gamma function must be undefined at those points to avoid division by zero; it is a meromorphic function with simple poles at the non-positive integers.

For a function formula_202 of a complex variable formula_2, at a simple pole formula_204, the residue of formula_202 is given by:
formula_206

For the simple pole formula_207, the recurrence formula can be rewritten as:
formula_208
The numerator at formula_209 is
formula_210
and the denominator 
formula_211
So the residues of the gamma function at those points are:
formula_212The gamma function is non-zero everywhere along the real line, although it comes arbitrarily close to zero as . There is in fact no complex number formula_2 for which formula_214, and hence the reciprocal gamma function formula_215 is an entire function, with zeros at formula_216.

=== Minima and maxima ===
On the real line, the gamma function has a local minimum at where it attains the value . The gamma function rises to either side of this minimum. The solution to is and the common value is . The positive solution to is , the golden ratio, and the common value is .

The gamma function must alternate sign between its poles at the non-positive integers because the product in the forward recurrence contains an odd number of negative factors if the number of poles between formula_2 and formula_199 is odd, and an even number if the number of poles is even. The values at the local extrema of the gamma function along the real axis between the non-positive integers are:
: ,
: ,
: , etc.

=== Integral representations ===
There are many formulas, besides the Euler integral of the second kind, that express the gamma function as an integral. For instance, when the real part of is positive,
formula_219
and
formula_220
formula_221
where the three integrals respectively follow from the substitutions formula_222, formula_223 and formula_224 in Euler&#x27;s second integral. The last integral in particular makes clear the connection between the gamma function at half integer arguments and the Gaussian integral: if formula_225 we get
formula_226

Binet&#x27;s first integral formula for the gamma function states that, when the real part of is positive, then:
formula_227
The integral on the right-hand side may be interpreted as a Laplace transform. That is,
formula_228

Binet&#x27;s second integral formula states that, again when the real part of is positive, then:
formula_229

Let be a Hankel contour, meaning a path that begins and ends at the point on the Riemann sphere, whose unit tangent vector converges to at the start of the path and to at the end, which has winding number 1 around , and which does not cross . Fix a branch of formula_230 by taking a branch cut along and by taking formula_230 to be real when is on the negative real axis. Assume is not an integer. Then Hankel&#x27;s formula for the gamma function is:
formula_232
where formula_233 is interpreted as formula_234. The reflection formula leads to the closely related expression 
formula_235
again valid whenever is not an integer.

=== Continued fraction representation ===
The gamma function can also be represented by a sum of two continued fractions:
formula_236
where formula_237.

=== Fourier series expansion ===
The logarithm of the gamma function has the following Fourier series expansion for formula_238
formula_239
which was for a long time attributed to Ernst Kummer, who derived it in 1847. However, Iaroslav Blagouchine discovered that Carl Johan Malmsten first derived this series in 1842.

=== Raabe&#x27;s formula ===
In 1840 Joseph Ludwig Raabe proved that
formula_240
In particular, if formula_241 then
formula_242

The latter can be derived taking the logarithm in the above multiplication formula, which gives an expression for the Riemann sum of the integrand. Taking the limit for formula_243 gives the formula.

=== Pi function ===
An alternative notation introduced by Gauss is the formula_244-function, a shifted version of the gamma function:
formula_245
so that formula_246 for every non-negative integer formula_9.

Using the pi function, the reflection formula is:
formula_248
using the normalized sinc function; while the multiplication theorem becomes:
formula_249

The shifted reciprocal gamma function is sometimes denoted formula_250
an entire function.

The volume of an -ellipsoid with radii can be expressed as
formula_251

=== Relation to other functions ===
* In the first integral defining the gamma function, the limits of integration are fixed. The upper incomplete gamma function is obtained by allowing the lower limit of integration to vary:formula_252There is a similar lower incomplete gamma function.
* The gamma function is related to Euler&#x27;s beta function by the formula formula_253
* The logarithmic derivative of the gamma function is called the digamma function; higher derivatives are the polygamma functions.
* The analog of the gamma function over a finite field or a finite ring is the Gaussian sums, a type of exponential sum.
* The reciprocal gamma function is an entire function and has been studied as a specific topic.
* The gamma function also shows up in an important relation with the Riemann zeta function, formula_254. formula_255 It also appears in the following formula: formula_256 which is valid only for formula_257. The logarithm of the gamma function satisfies the following formula due to Lerch: formula_258 where formula_259 is the Hurwitz zeta function, formula_260 is the Riemann zeta function and the prime () denotes differentiation in the first variable.
* The gamma function is related to the stretched exponential function. For instance, the moments of that function are formula_261

=== Particular values ===

Including up to the first 20 digits after the decimal point, some particular values of the gamma function are:
formula_262
(These numbers can be found in the OEIS. The values presented here are truncated rather than rounded.)
The complex-valued gamma function is undefined for non-positive integers, but in these cases the value can be defined in the Riemann sphere as . The reciprocal gamma function is well defined and analytic at these values (and in the entire complex plane):
formula_263

== Log-gamma function ==

Because the gamma and factorial functions grow so rapidly for moderately large arguments, many computing environments include a function that returns the natural logarithm of the gamma function, often given the name codice_1 or codice_2 in programming environments or codice_3 in spreadsheets. This grows much more slowly, and for combinatorial calculations allows adding and subtracting logarithmic values instead of multiplying and dividing very large values. It is often defined as
formula_264

The digamma function, which is the derivative of this function, is also commonly seen.
In the context of technical and physical applications, e.g. with wave propagation, the functional equation
formula_265

is often used since it allows one to determine function values in one strip of width 1 in from the neighbouring strip. In particular, starting with a good approximation for a  with large real part one may go step by step down to the desired . Following an indication of Carl Friedrich Gauss, Rocktaeschel (1922) proposed for an approximation for large :
formula_266

This can be used to accurately approximate for with a smaller via (P.E.Böhmer, 1939)
formula_267

A more accurate approximation can be obtained by using more terms from the asymptotic expansions of and , which are based on Stirling&#x27;s approximation.
formula_268
: as at constant . (See sequences and in the OEIS.)

In a more &quot;natural&quot; presentation:
formula_269
: as at constant . (See sequences and in the OEIS.)

The coefficients of the terms with of in the last expansion are simply
formula_270
where the are the Bernoulli numbers.

The gamma function also has Stirling Series (derived by Charles Hermite in 1900) equal to
formula_271

=== Properties ===
The Bohr–Mollerup theorem states that among all functions extending the factorial functions to the positive real numbers, only the gamma function is log-convex, that is, its natural logarithm is convex on the positive real axis. Another characterisation is given by the Wielandt theorem.

The gamma function is the unique function that simultaneously satisfies
# formula_272,
# formula_273 for all complex numbers formula_2 except the non-positive integers, and,
# for integer , formula_275 for all complex numbers formula_2.

In a certain sense, the log-gamma function is the more natural form; it makes some intrinsic attributes of the function clearer. A striking example is the Taylor series of around 1:
formula_277
with denoting the Riemann zeta function at .

So, using the following property:
formula_278
an integral representation for the log-gamma function is:
formula_279
or, setting to obtain an integral for , we can replace the term with its integral and incorporate that into the above formula, to get:
formula_280

There also exist special formulas for the logarithm of the gamma function for rational . 
For instance, if formula_71 and formula_9 are integers with formula_283 and formula_284 then
formula_285This formula is sometimes used for numerical computation, since the integrand decreases very quickly.

=== Integration over log-gamma ===

The integral
formula_286
can be expressed in terms of the Barnes -function (see Barnes -function for a proof):
formula_287
where .

It can also be written in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function:
formula_288

When formula_289 it follows that
formula_290
and this is a consequence of Raabe&#x27;s formula as well. O. Espinosa and V. Moll derived a similar formula for the integral of the square of formula_291:
formula_292
where formula_293 is formula_294.

D. H. Bailey and his co-authors gave an evaluation for
formula_295
when formula_296 in terms of the Tornheim–Witten zeta function and its derivatives.

In addition, it is also known that
formula_297

== Approximations ==

Complex values of the gamma function can be approximated using Stirling&#x27;s approximation or the Lanczos approximation, 
formula_298
This is precise in the sense that the ratio of the approximation to the true value approaches 1 in the limit as goes to infinity.

The gamma function can be computed to fixed precision for formula_299 by applying integration by parts to Euler&#x27;s integral. For any positive number  the gamma function can be written
formula_300

When and formula_301, the absolute value of the last integral is smaller than formula_302. By choosing a large enough formula_175, this last expression can be made smaller than formula_304 for any desired value formula_305. Thus, the gamma function can be evaluated to formula_305 bits of precision with the above series.

A fast algorithm for calculation of the Euler gamma function for any algebraic argument (including rational) was constructed by E.A. Karatsuba.

For arguments that are integer multiples of , the gamma function can also be evaluated quickly using arithmetic–geometric mean iterations (see particular values of the gamma function).

== Practical implementations ==
Unlike many other functions, such as a Normal Distribution, no obvious fast, accurate implementation that is easy to implement for the Gamma Function formula_1 is easily found. Therefore, it is worth investigating potential solutions. For the case that speed is more important than accuracy, published tables for formula_1 are easily found in an Internet search, such as the Online Wiley Library. Such tables may be used with linear interpolation. Greater accuracy is obtainable with the use of cubic interpolation at the cost of more computational overhead. Since formula_1 tables are usually published for argument values between 1 and 2, the property formula_310 may be used to quickly and easily translate all real values formula_311 and formula_312 into the range formula_313, such that only tabulated values of formula_2 between 1 and 2 need be used.

If interpolation tables are not desirable, then the Lanczos approximation mentioned above works well for 1 to 2 digits of accuracy for small, commonly used values of z. If the Lanczos approximation is not sufficiently accurate, the Stirling&#x27;s formula for the Gamma Function may be used.

== Applications ==
One author describes the gamma function as &quot;Arguably, the most common special function, or the least &#x27;special&#x27; of them. The other transcendental functions […] are called &#x27;special&#x27; because you could conceivably avoid some of them by staying away from many specialized mathematical topics. On the other hand, the gamma function is most difficult to avoid.&quot;

=== Integration problems ===

The gamma function finds application in such diverse areas as quantum physics, astrophysics and fluid dynamics. The gamma distribution, which is formulated in terms of the gamma function, is used in statistics to model a wide range of processes; for example, the time between occurrences of earthquakes.

The primary reason for the gamma function&#x27;s usefulness in such contexts is the prevalence of expressions of the type formula_315 which describe processes that decay exponentially in time or space. Integrals of such expressions can occasionally be solved in terms of the gamma function when no elementary solution exists. For example, if is a power function and is a linear function, a simple change of variables formula_316 gives the evaluation

formula_317

The fact that the integration is performed along the entire positive real line might signify that the gamma function describes the cumulation of a time-dependent process that continues indefinitely, or the value might be the total of a distribution in an infinite space.

It is of course frequently useful to take limits of integration other than 0 and to describe the cumulation of a finite process, in which case the ordinary gamma function is no longer a solution; the solution is then called an incomplete gamma function. (The ordinary gamma function, obtained by integrating across the entire positive real line, is sometimes called the &quot;complete gamma function&quot; for contrast.)

An important category of exponentially decaying functions is that of Gaussian functions
formula_318
and integrals thereof, such as the error function. There are many interrelations between these functions and the gamma function; notably, the factor formula_319 obtained by evaluating formula_320 is the &quot;same&quot; as that found in the normalizing factor of the error function and the normal distribution.

The integrals discussed so far involve transcendental functions, but the gamma function also arises from integrals of purely algebraic functions. In particular, the arc lengths of ellipses and of the lemniscate, which are curves defined by algebraic equations, are given by elliptic integrals that in special cases can be evaluated in terms of the gamma function. The gamma function can also be used to calculate &quot;volume&quot; and &quot;area&quot; of -dimensional hyperspheres.

=== Calculating products ===
The gamma function&#x27;s ability to generalize factorial products immediately leads to applications in many areas of mathematics; in combinatorics, and by extension in areas such as probability theory and the calculation of power series. Many expressions involving products of successive integers can be written as some combination of factorials, the most important example perhaps being that of the binomial coefficient. For example, for any complex numbers and , with , we can write
formula_321
which closely resembles the binomial coefficient when is a non-negative integer,
formula_322

The example of binomial coefficients motivates why the properties of the gamma function when extended to negative numbers are natural. A binomial coefficient gives the number of ways to choose elements from a set of elements; if , there are of course no ways. If , is the factorial of a negative integer and hence infinite if we use the gamma function definition of factorials—dividing by infinity gives the expected value of 0.

We can replace the factorial by a gamma function to extend any such formula to the complex numbers. Generally, this works for any product wherein each factor is a rational function of the index variable, by factoring the rational function into linear expressions. If and are monic polynomials of degree and with respective roots and , we have
formula_323

If we have a way to calculate the gamma function numerically, it is very simple to calculate numerical values of such products. The number of gamma functions in the right-hand side depends only on the degree of the polynomials, so it does not matter whether equals 5 or 105. By taking the appropriate limits, the equation can also be made to hold even when the left-hand product contains zeros or poles.

By taking limits, certain rational products with infinitely many factors can be evaluated in terms of the gamma function as well. Due to the Weierstrass factorization theorem, analytic functions can be written as infinite products, and these can sometimes be represented as finite products or quotients of the gamma function. We have already seen one striking example: the reflection formula essentially represents the sine function as the product of two gamma functions. Starting from this formula, the exponential function as well as all the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions can be expressed in terms of the gamma function.

More functions yet, including the hypergeometric function and special cases thereof, can be represented by means of complex contour integrals of products and quotients of the gamma function, called Mellin–Barnes integrals.

=== Analytic number theory ===

An application of the gamma function is the study of the Riemann zeta function. A fundamental property of the Riemann zeta function is its functional equation:
formula_324

Among other things, this provides an explicit form for the analytic continuation of the zeta function to a meromorphic function in the complex plane and leads to an immediate proof that the zeta function has infinitely many so-called &quot;trivial&quot; zeros on the real line. Borwein &quot;et al.&quot; call this formula &quot;one of the most beautiful findings in mathematics&quot;. Another contender for that title might be
formula_325

Both formulas were derived by Bernhard Riemann in his seminal 1859 paper &quot;Ueber die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Größe&quot; (&quot;On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude&quot;), one of the milestones in the development of analytic number theory—the branch of mathematics that studies prime numbers using the tools of mathematical analysis.

== History ==
The gamma function has caught the interest of some of the most prominent mathematicians of all time. Its history, notably documented by Philip J. Davis in an article that won him the 1963 Chauvenet Prize, reflects many of the major developments within mathematics since the 18th century. In the words of Davis, &quot;each generation has found something of interest to say about the gamma function. Perhaps the next generation will also.&quot;

=== 18th century: Euler and Stirling ===
The problem of extending the factorial to non-integer arguments was apparently first considered by Daniel Bernoulli and Christian Goldbach in the 1720s. In particular, in a letter from Bernoulli to Goldbach dated 6 October 1729 Bernoulli introduced the product representation
formula_326
which is well defined for real values of other than the negative integers.

Leonhard Euler later gave two different definitions: the first was not his integral but an infinite product that is well defined for all complex numbers other than the negative integers,
formula_327
of which he informed Goldbach in a letter dated 13 October 1729. He wrote to Goldbach again on 8 January 1730, to announce his discovery of the integral representation
formula_328
which is valid when the real part of the complex number is strictly greater than (i.e., formula_329). By the change of variables , this becomes the familiar Euler integral. Euler published his results in the paper &quot;De progressionibus transcendentibus seu quarum termini generales algebraice dari nequeunt&quot; (&quot;On transcendental progressions, that is, those whose general terms cannot be given algebraically&quot;), submitted to the St. Petersburg Academy on 28 November 1729. Euler further discovered some of the gamma function&#x27;s important functional properties, including the reflection formula.

James Stirling, a contemporary of Euler, also attempted to find a continuous expression for the factorial and came up with what is now known as Stirling&#x27;s formula. Although Stirling&#x27;s formula gives a good estimate of , also for non-integers, it does not provide the exact value. Extensions of his formula that correct the error were given by Stirling himself and by Jacques Philippe Marie Binet.

=== 19th century: Gauss, Weierstrass and Legendre ===
Carl Friedrich Gauss rewrote Euler&#x27;s product as
formula_330
and used this formula to discover new properties of the gamma function. Although Euler was a pioneer in the theory of complex variables, he does not appear to have considered the factorial of a complex number, as instead Gauss first did. Gauss also proved the multiplication theorem of the gamma function and investigated the connection between the gamma function and elliptic integrals.

Karl Weierstrass further established the role of the gamma function in complex analysis, starting from yet another product representation,
formula_331
where is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. Weierstrass originally wrote his product as one for , in which case it is taken over the function&#x27;s zeros rather than its poles. Inspired by this result, he proved what is known as the Weierstrass factorization theorem—that any entire function can be written as a product over its zeros in the complex plane; a generalization of the fundamental theorem of algebra.

The name gamma function and the symbol were introduced by Adrien-Marie Legendre around 1811; Legendre also rewrote Euler&#x27;s integral definition in its modern form. Although the symbol is an upper-case Greek gamma, there is no accepted standard for whether the function name should be written &quot;gamma function&quot; or &quot;Gamma function&quot; (some authors simply write &quot;-function&quot;). The alternative &quot;pi function&quot; notation due to Gauss is sometimes encountered in older literature, but Legendre&#x27;s notation is dominant in modern works.

It is justified to ask why we distinguish between the &quot;ordinary factorial&quot; and the gamma function by using distinct symbols, and particularly why the gamma function should be normalized to instead of simply using &quot;&quot;. Consider that the notation for exponents, , has been generalized from integers to complex numbers without any change. Legendre&#x27;s motivation for the normalization is not known, and has been criticized as cumbersome by some (the 20th-century mathematician Cornelius Lanczos, for example, called it &quot;void of any rationality&quot; and would instead use ). Legendre&#x27;s normalization does simplify some formulae, but complicates others. From a modern point of view, the Legendre normalization of the gamma function is the integral of the additive character against the multiplicative character with respect to the Haar measure formula_332 on the Lie group . Thus this normalization makes it clearer that the gamma function is a continuous analogue of a Gauss sum.

=== 19th–20th centuries: characterizing the gamma function ===
It is somewhat problematic that a large number of definitions have been given for the gamma function. Although they describe the same function, it is not entirely straightforward to prove the equivalence. Stirling never proved that his extended formula corresponds exactly to Euler&#x27;s gamma function; a proof was first given by Charles Hermite in 1900. Instead of finding a specialized proof for each formula, it would be desirable to have a general method of identifying the gamma function.

One way to prove equivalence would be to find a differential equation that characterizes the gamma function. Most special functions in applied mathematics arise as solutions to differential equations, whose solutions are unique. However, the gamma function does not appear to satisfy any simple differential equation. Otto Hölder proved in 1887 that the gamma function at least does not satisfy any &quot;algebraic&quot; differential equation by showing that a solution to such an equation could not satisfy the gamma function&#x27;s recurrence formula, making it a transcendentally transcendental function. This result is known as Hölder&#x27;s theorem.

A definite and generally applicable characterization of the gamma function was not given until 1922. Harald Bohr and Johannes Mollerup then proved what is known as the Bohr–Mollerup theorem: that the gamma function is the unique solution to the factorial recurrence relation that is positive and &quot;logarithmically convex&quot; for positive and whose value at 1 is 1 (a function is logarithmically convex if its logarithm is convex). Another characterisation is given by the Wielandt theorem.

The Bohr–Mollerup theorem is useful because it is relatively easy to prove logarithmic convexity for any of the different formulas used to define the gamma function. Taking things further, instead of defining the gamma function by any particular formula, we can choose the conditions of the Bohr–Mollerup theorem as the definition, and then pick any formula we like that satisfies the conditions as a starting point for studying the gamma function. This approach was used by the Bourbaki group.

Borwein &amp; Corless review three centuries of work on the gamma function.

=== Reference tables and software ===

Although the gamma function can be calculated virtually as easily as any mathematically simpler function with a modern computer—even with a programmable pocket calculator—this was of course not always the case. Until the mid-20th century, mathematicians relied on hand-made tables; in the case of the gamma function, notably a table computed by Gauss in 1813 and one computed by Legendre in 1825.

Tables of complex values of the gamma function, as well as hand-drawn graphs, were given in &quot;Tables of Functions With Formulas and Curves&quot; by Jahnke and , first published in Germany in 1909. According to Michael Berry, &quot;the publication in J&amp;E of a three-dimensional graph showing the poles of the gamma function in the complex plane acquired an almost iconic status.&quot;

There was in fact little practical need for anything but real values of the gamma function until the 1930s, when applications for the complex gamma function were discovered in theoretical physics. As electronic computers became available for the production of tables in the 1950s, several extensive tables for the complex gamma function were published to meet the demand, including a table accurate to 12 decimal places from the U.S. National Bureau of Standards.

Double-precision floating-point implementations of the gamma function and its logarithm are now available in most scientific computing software and special functions libraries, for example TK Solver, Matlab, GNU Octave, and the GNU Scientific Library. The gamma function was also added to the C standard library (math.h). Arbitrary-precision implementations are available in most computer algebra systems, such as Mathematica and Maple. PARI/GP, MPFR and MPFUN contain free arbitrary-precision implementations. In some software calculators, e.g. Windows Calculator and GNOME Calculator, the factorial function returns Γ(&quot;x&quot; + 1) when the input &quot;x&quot; is a non-integer value.

<text>Georges Braque ( ; ; 13 May 1882 – 31 August 1963) was a major 20th-century French painter, collagist, draughtsman, printmaker and sculptor. His most notable contributions were in his alliance with Fauvism from 1905, and the role he played in the development of Cubism. Braque&#x27;s work between 1908 and 1912 is closely associated with that of his colleague Pablo Picasso. Their respective Cubist works were indistinguishable for many years, yet the quiet nature of Braque was partially eclipsed by the fame and notoriety of Picasso.

==Early life==
Georges Braque was born on 13 May 1882 in Argenteuil, Val-d&#x27;Oise. He grew up in Le Havre and trained to be a house painter and decorator like his father and grandfather. However, he also studied artistic painting during evenings at the École supérieure d&#x27;art et design Le Havre-Rouen, previously known as the École supérieure des Arts in Le Havre, from about 1897 to 1899. In Paris, he apprenticed with a decorator and was awarded his certificate in 1902. The next year, he attended the Académie Humbert, also in Paris, and painted there until 1904. It was here that he met Marie Laurencin and Francis Picabia.

==Fauvism==

Braque&#x27;s earliest works were impressionistic, but after seeing the work exhibited by the artistic group known as the &quot;Fauves&quot; (Beasts) in 1905, he adopted a Fauvist style. The Fauves, a group that included Henri Matisse and André Derain among others, used brilliant colors to represent emotional response. Braque worked most closely with the artists Raoul Dufy and Othon Friesz, who shared Braque&#x27;s hometown of Le Havre, to develop a somewhat more subdued Fauvist style. In 1906, Braque traveled with Friesz to L&#x27;Estaque, to Antwerp, and home to Le Havre to paint.

In May 1907, he successfully exhibited works of the Fauve style in the Salon des Indépendants. The same year, Braque&#x27;s style began a slow evolution as he became influenced by Paul Cézanne who had died in 1906 and whose works were exhibited in Paris for the first time in a large-scale, museum-like retrospective in September 1907. The 1907 Cézanne retrospective at the greatly affected the avant-garde artists of Paris, resulting in the advent of Cubism.

==Cubism==

Braque&#x27;s paintings of 1908–1912 reflected his new interest in geometry and simultaneous perspective. He conducted an intense study of the effects of light and perspective and the technical means that painters use to represent these effects, seeming to question the most standard of artistic conventions. In his village scenes, for example, Braque frequently reduced an architectural structure to a geometric form approximating a cube, yet rendered its shading so that it looked both flat and three-dimensional by fragmenting the image. He showed this in the painting &quot;Houses at l&#x27;Estaque&quot;.

Beginning in 1909, Braque began to work closely with Pablo Picasso who had been developing a similar proto-Cubist style of painting. At the time, Pablo Picasso was influenced by Gauguin, Cézanne, African masks and Iberian sculpture while Braque was interested mainly in developing Cézanne&#x27;s ideas of multiple perspectives. &quot;A comparison of the works of Picasso and Braque during 1908 reveals that the effect of his encounter with Picasso was more to accelerate and intensify Braque’s exploration of Cézanne’s ideas, rather than to divert his thinking in any essential way.&quot; Braque&#x27;s essential subject is the ordinary objects he has known practically forever. Picasso celebrates animation, while Braque celebrates contemplation. Thus, the invention of Cubism was a joint effort between Picasso and Braque, then residents of Montmartre, Paris. These artists were the style&#x27;s main innovators. After meeting in October or November 1907, Braque and Picasso, in particular, began working on the development of Cubism in 1908. Both artists produced paintings of monochromatic color and complex patterns of faceted form, now termed Analytic Cubism.

A decisive time of its development occurred during the summer of 1911, when Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso painted side by side in Céret in the French Pyrenees, each artist producing paintings that are difficult—sometimes virtually impossible—to distinguish from those of the other. In 1912, they began to experiment with collage and Braque invented the &quot;papier collé&quot; technique.

On 14 November 1908, the French art critic Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of Georges Braque&#x27;s exhibition at Kahnweiler&#x27;s gallery called Braque a daring man who despises form, &quot;reducing everything, places and a figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes&quot;.

Vauxcelles, on 25 March 1909, used the terms &quot;bizarreries cubiques&quot; (cubic oddities) after seeing a painting by Braque at the Salon des Indépendants.

The term &#x27;Cubism&#x27;, first pronounced in 1911 with reference to artists exhibiting at the Salon des Indépendants, quickly gained wide use but Picasso and Braque did not adopt it initially. Art historian Ernst Gombrich described Cubism as &quot;the most radical attempt to stamp out ambiguity and to enforce one reading of the picture—that of a man-made construction, a colored canvas.&quot; The Cubist style spread quickly throughout Paris and then Europe.

The two artists&#x27; productive collaboration continued and they worked closely together until the beginning of World War I in 1914, when Braque enlisted with the French Army. In May 1915, Braque received a severe head injury in battle at Carency and suffered temporary blindness. He was trepanned, and required a long period of recuperation.

==Later work==

Braque resumed painting in late 1916. Working alone, he began to moderate the harsh abstraction of cubism. He developed a more personal style characterized by brilliant color, textured surfaces, and—after his relocation to the Normandy seacoast—the reappearance of the human figure. He painted many still life subjects during this time, maintaining his emphasis on structure. One example of this is his 1943 work &quot;Blue Guitar&quot;, which hangs in the Allen Memorial Art Museum. During his recovery he became a close friend of the cubist artist Juan Gris.

He continued to work during the remainder of his life, producing a considerable number of paintings, graphics, and sculptures. Braque, along with Matisse, is credited for introducing Pablo Picasso to Fernand Mourlot, and most of the lithographs and book illustrations he himself created during the 1940s and &#x27;50s were produced at the Mourlot Studios. In 1952–53 he also produced &quot;The Birds&quot;, a ceiling painting for a room in the Louvre. In 1962 Braque worked with master printmaker Aldo Crommelynck to create his series of etchings and aquatints titled &quot;L’Ordre des Oiseaux&quot; (&quot;The Order of Birds&quot;), which was accompanied by the poet Saint-John Perse&#x27;s text.

Braque died on 31 August 1963 in Paris. He is buried in the cemetery of the Church of St. Valery in Varengeville-sur-Mer, Normandy whose windows he designed. Braque&#x27;s work is in most major museums throughout the world.

==Style==
Braque believed that an artist experienced beauty &quot;… in terms of volume, of line, of mass, of weight, and through that beauty [he] interpret[s] [his] subjective impression...&quot; He described &quot;objects shattered into fragments... [as] a way of getting closest to the object...Fragmentation helped me to establish space and movement in space&quot;. He adopted a monochromatic and neutral color palette in the belief that such a palette would emphasize the subject matter.

Although Braque began his career painting landscapes, during 1908 he, alongside Picasso, discovered the advantages of painting still lifes instead. Braque explained that he
&quot;... began to concentrate on still lifes, because in the still-life you have a tactile, I might almost say a manual space... This answered to the hankering I have always had to touch things and not merely see them... In tactile space you measure the distance separating you from the object, whereas in visual space you measure the distance separating things from each other. This is what led me, long ago, from landscape to still-life&quot; A still life was also more accessible, in relation to perspective, than landscape, and permitted the artist to see the multiple perspectives of the object. Braque&#x27;s early interest in still lifes revived during the 1930s.

During the period between the wars, Braque exhibited a freer, more relaxed style of Cubism, intensifying his color use and a looser rendering of objects. However, he still remained committed to the cubist method of simultaneous perspective and fragmentation. In contrast to Picasso, who continuously reinvented his style of painting, producing both representational and cubist images, and incorporating surrealist ideas into his work, Braque continued in the Cubist style, producing luminous, other-worldly still life and figure compositions. By the time of his death in 1963, he was regarded as one of the elder statesmen of the School of Paris, and of modern art.

==2010 theft==
On 20 May 2010, the Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris reported the overnight theft of five paintings from its collection. The paintings taken were &quot;Le pigeon aux petits pois&quot; (&quot;The Pigeon with the Peas&quot;) by Pablo Picasso, &quot;La Pastorale&quot; by Henri Matisse, &quot;L&#x27;Olivier Près de l&#x27;Estaque&quot; (&quot;Olive Tree near Estaque&quot;) by Georges Braque, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Woman with a Fan&quot;) by Amedeo Modigliani and &quot;Nature Morte aux Chandeliers&quot; (&quot;Still Life with Chandeliers&quot;) by Fernand Léger and were valued at ( ). A window had been smashed and CCTV footage showed a masked man taking the paintings. Authorities believe the thief acted alone. The man carefully removed the paintings from their frames, which he left behind.

<text>Gilbert Cesbron (13 January 1913, Paris – 12 August 1979, Paris) was a French novelist.

== Biography ==
Gilbert Cesbron (13 January 1913, Paris – 12 August 1979, Paris) was a French novelist. Born in Paris, Cesbron attended what is now known as Lycée Condorcet. In 1944 he published his first novel, &quot;Les innocents de Paris&quot; (&quot;&quot;The Innocent of Paris&quot;), in Switzerland. He first achieved wide public acclaim with the publication of &quot;Notre prison est un royaume&quot; (&quot;Our Prison is a Kingdom&quot;) in 1948 and &quot;Il est minuit, docteur Schweitzer&quot; (&quot;It is midnight, Doctor Schweitzer&quot;) in 1950.

In his works Cesbron tended to illustrate and describe relevant social topics such as juvenile delinquency in &quot;Chiens perdus sans collier&quot; (&quot;Lost Dogs Without Collars&quot;), violence in &quot;Entre chiens et loups&quot; (&quot;Between Dogs and Wolves&quot;), euthanasia in &quot;Il est plus tard que tu ne penses&quot; (&quot;It is Later than You Think&quot;) and working priests in &quot;Les Saints vont en enfer&quot; (&quot;Saints in Hell&quot;&quot;).

In 1955, Cesbron&#x27;s book &quot;Chiens perdus sans collier&quot;, the story of an orphan boy and a benevolent judge, was made into a movie starring Jean Gabin and Robert Dalban.

He died on 12 August 1979 at his home at 126 Boulevard Saint-Germain in the 6th arrondissement of Paris. He is buried in Bourré, Loir-et-Cher. His widow, Dominique, died in 2003.

<doc id="12323" wikidata="Q178940" url="?curid=12323" title="GNU Compiler Collection">
<text>The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is a collection of compilers from the GNU Project that support various programming languages, hardware architectures and operating systems. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) distributes GCC as free software under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL). GCC is a key component of the GNU toolchain which is used for most projects related to GNU and the Linux kernel. With roughly 15 million lines of code in 2019, GCC is one of the largest free programs in existence. It has played an important role in the growth of free software, as both a tool and an example.

When it was first released in 1987 by Richard Stallman, GCC 1.0 was named the GNU C Compiler since it only handled the C programming language. It was extended to compile C++ in December of that year. Front ends were later developed for Objective-C, Objective-C++, Fortran, Ada, D, Go and Rust, among others. The OpenMP and OpenACC specifications are also supported in the C and C++ compilers.

GCC has been ported to more platforms and instruction set architectures than any other compiler, and is widely deployed as a tool in the development of both free and proprietary software. GCC is also available for many embedded systems, including ARM-based and Power ISA-based chips.

As well as being the official compiler of the GNU operating system, GCC has been adopted as the standard compiler by many other modern Unix-like computer operating systems, including most Linux distributions. Most BSD family operating systems also switched to GCC shortly after its release, although since then, FreeBSD and Apple macOS have moved to the Clang compiler, largely due to licensing reasons. GCC can also compile code for Windows, Android, iOS, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and DOS.

== History ==
In late 1983, in an effort to bootstrap the GNU operating system, Richard Stallman asked Andrew S. Tanenbaum, the author of the Amsterdam Compiler Kit (also known as the &quot;Free University&quot; &quot;Compiler Kit&quot;) for permission to use that software for GNU. When Tanenbaum advised him that the compiler was not free, and that only the university was free, Stallman decided to work on a different compiler. His initial plan was to rewrite an existing compiler from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory from Pastel to C with some help from Len Tower and others. Stallman wrote a new C front end for the Livermore compiler, but then realized that it required megabytes of stack space, an impossibility on a 68000 Unix system with only 64 KB, and concluded he would have to write a new compiler from scratch. None of the Pastel compiler code ended up in GCC, though Stallman did use the C front end he had written.

GCC was first released March 22, 1987, available by FTP from MIT. Stallman was listed as the author but cited others for their contributions, including Tower for &quot;parts of the parser, RTL generator, RTL definitions, and of the Vax machine description&quot;, Jack Davidson and Christopher W. Fraser for the idea of using RTL as an intermediate language, and Paul Rubin for writing most of the preprocessor. Described as the &quot;first free software hit&quot; by Peter H. Salus, the GNU compiler arrived just at the time when Sun Microsystems was unbundling its development tools from its operating system, selling them separately at a higher combined price than the previous bundle, which led many of Sun&#x27;s users to buy or download GCC instead of the vendor&#x27;s tools. While Stallman considered GNU Emacs as his main project, by 1990 GCC supported thirteen computer architectures, was outperforming several vendor compilers, and was used commercially by several companies.

=== EGCS fork ===
As GCC was licensed under the GPL, programmers wanting to work in other directions—particularly those writing interfaces for languages other than C—were free to develop their own fork of the compiler, provided they meet the GPL&#x27;s terms, including its requirements to distribute source code. Multiple forks proved inefficient and unwieldy, however, and the difficulty in getting work accepted by the official GCC project was greatly frustrating for many, as the project favored stability over new features. The FSF kept such close control on what was added to the official version of GCC 2.x (developed since 1992) that GCC was used as one example of the &quot;cathedral&quot; development model in Eric S. Raymond&#x27;s essay &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;.

In 1997, a group of developers formed the &quot;Experimental/Enhanced GNU Compiler System (EGCS)&quot; to merge several experimental forks into a single project. The basis of the merger was a development snapshot of GCC (taken around the 2.7.2 and later followed up to 2.8.1 release). Mergers included g77 (Fortran), PGCC (P5 Pentium-optimized GCC), many C++ improvements, and many new architectures and operating system variants.

While both projects followed each other&#x27;s changes closely, EGCS development proved considerably more vigorous, so much so that the FSF officially halted development on their GCC 2.x compiler, blessed EGCS as the official version of GCC, and appointed the EGCS project as the GCC maintainers in April 1999. With the release of GCC 2.95 in July 1999 the two projects were once again united. GCC has since been maintained by a varied group of programmers from around the world under the direction of a steering committee.

GCC 3 (2002) removed a front-end for CHILL due to a lack of maintenance.

Before version 4.0 the Fortran front end was codice_1, which only supported FORTRAN 77, but later was dropped in favor of the new GNU Fortran front end that supports Fortran 95 and large parts of Fortran 2003 and Fortran 2008 as well.

As of version 4.8, GCC is implemented in C++.

Support for Cilk Plus existed from GCC 5 to GCC 7.

GCC has been ported to a wide variety of instruction set architectures, and is widely deployed as a tool in the development of both free and proprietary software. GCC is also available for many embedded systems, including Symbian (called &quot;gcce&quot;), ARM-based, and Power ISA-based chips. The compiler can target a wide variety of platforms, including video game consoles such as the PlayStation 2, Cell SPE of PlayStation 3, and Dreamcast. It has been ported to more kinds of processors and operating systems than any other compiler.

== Supported languages ==
 GCC includes front ends for C (codice_2), C++ (codice_3), Objective-C and Objective-C++, Fortran (codice_4), Ada (GNAT), Go (codice_5), D (codice_6, since 9.1), and Modula-2 (codice_7, since 13.1) programming languages, with the OpenMP and OpenACC parallel language extensions being supported since GCC 5.1. Versions prior to GCC 7 also supported Java (codice_8), allowing compilation of Java to native machine code.

Regarding language version support for C++ and C, since GCC 11.1 the default target is &quot;gnu++17&quot;, a superset of C++17, and &quot;gnu11&quot;, a superset of C11, with strict standard support also available. GCC also provides experimental support for C++20 and C++23.

Third-party front ends exist for many languages, such as Pascal (codice_9), Modula-3, and VHDL (codice_10). A few experimental branches exist to support additional languages, such as the GCC UPC compiler for Unified Parallel C or Rust.

== Design ==

GCC&#x27;s external interface follows Unix conventions. Users invoke a language-specific driver program (codice_2 for C, codice_3 for C++, etc.), which interprets command arguments, calls the actual compiler, runs the assembler on the output, and then optionally runs the linker to produce a complete executable binary.

Each of the language compilers is a separate program that reads source code and outputs machine code. All have a common internal structure. A per-language front end parses the source code in that language and produces an abstract syntax tree (&quot;tree&quot; for short).

These are, if necessary, converted to the middle end&#x27;s input representation, called &quot;GENERIC&quot; form; the middle end then gradually transforms the program towards its final form. Compiler optimizations and static code analysis techniques (such as FORTIFY_SOURCE, a compiler directive that attempts to discover some buffer overflows) are applied to the code. These work on multiple representations, mostly the architecture-independent GIMPLE representation and the architecture-dependent RTL representation. Finally, machine code is produced using architecture-specific pattern matching originally based on an algorithm of Jack Davidson and Chris Fraser.

GCC was written primarily in C except for parts of the Ada front end. The distribution includes the standard libraries for Ada and C++ whose code is mostly written in those languages. On some platforms, the distribution also includes a low-level runtime library, libgcc, written in a combination of machine-independent C and processor-specific machine code, designed primarily to handle arithmetic operations that the target processor cannot perform directly.

GCC uses many additional tools in its build, many of which are installed by default by many Unix and Linux distributions (but which, normally, aren&#x27;t present in Windows installations), including Perl, Flex, Bison, and other common tools. In addition, it currently requires three additional libraries to be present in order to build: GMP, MPC, and MPFR.

In May 2010, the GCC steering committee decided to allow use of a C++ compiler to compile GCC. The compiler was intended to be written mostly in C plus a subset of features from C++. In particular, this was decided so that GCC&#x27;s developers could use the destructors and generics features of C++.

In August 2012, the GCC steering committee announced that GCC now uses C++ as its implementation language. This means that to build GCC from sources, a C++ compiler is required that understands ISO/IEC C++03 standard.

On May 18, 2020, GCC moved away from ISO/IEC C++03 standard to ISO/IEC C++11 standard (i.e. needed to compile, bootstrap, the compiler itself; by default it however compiles later versions of C++).

=== Front ends ===

Each front end uses a parser to produce the abstract syntax tree of a given source file. Due to the syntax tree abstraction, source files of any of the different supported languages can be processed by the same back end. GCC started out using LALR parsers generated with Bison, but gradually switched to hand-written recursive-descent parsers for C++ in 2004, and for C and Objective-C in 2006. As of 2021 all front ends use hand-written recursive-descent parsers.

Until GCC 4.0 the tree representation of the program was not fully independent of the processor being targeted. The meaning of a tree was somewhat different for different language front ends, and front ends could provide their own tree codes. This was simplified with the introduction of GENERIC and GIMPLE, two new forms of language-independent trees that were introduced with the advent of GCC 4.0. GENERIC is more complex, based on the GCC 3.x Java front end&#x27;s intermediate representation. GIMPLE is a simplified GENERIC, in which various constructs are &quot;lowered&quot; to multiple GIMPLE instructions. The C, C++, and Java front ends produce GENERIC directly in the front end. Other front ends instead have different intermediate representations after parsing and convert these to GENERIC.

In either case, the so-called &quot;gimplifier&quot; then converts this more complex form into the simpler SSA-based GIMPLE form that is the common language for a large number of language- and architecture-independent global (function scope) optimizations.

=== GENERIC and GIMPLE ===
&quot;GENERIC&quot; is an intermediate representation language used as a &quot;middle end&quot; while compiling source code into executable binaries. A subset, called &quot;GIMPLE&quot;, is targeted by all the front ends of GCC.

The middle stage of GCC does all of the code analysis and optimization, working independently of both the compiled language and the target architecture, starting from the GENERIC representation and expanding it to register transfer language (RTL). The GENERIC representation contains only the subset of the imperative programming constructs optimized by the middle end.

In transforming the source code to GIMPLE, complex expressions are split into a three-address code using temporary variables. This representation was inspired by the SIMPLE representation proposed in the McCAT compiler by Laurie J. Hendren for simplifying the analysis and optimization of imperative programs.

=== Optimization ===
Optimization can occur during any phase of compilation; however, the bulk of optimizations are performed after the syntax and semantic analysis of the front end and before the code generation of the back end; thus a common, though somewhat self-contradictory, name for this part of the compiler is the &quot;middle end.&quot;

The exact set of GCC optimizations varies from release to release as it develops, but includes the standard algorithms, such as loop optimization, jump threading, common subexpression elimination, instruction scheduling, and so forth. The RTL optimizations are of less importance with the addition of global SSA-based optimizations on GIMPLE trees, as RTL optimizations have a much more limited scope, and have less high-level information.

Some of these optimizations performed at this level include dead-code elimination, partial-redundancy elimination, global value numbering, sparse conditional constant propagation, and scalar replacement of aggregates. Array dependence based optimizations such as automatic vectorization and automatic parallelization are also performed. Profile-guided optimization is also possible.

=== C++ Standard Library (libstdc++) ===
The GCC project includes an implementation of the C++ Standard Library called libstdc++, licensed under the GPLv3 License with an exception to link non-GPL applications when sources are built with GCC.

=== Other features ===
Some features of GCC include:

; Link-time optimization
: Link-time optimization optimizes across object file boundaries to directly improve the linked binary. Link-time optimization relies on an intermediate file containing the serialization of some &quot;Gimple&quot; representation included in the object file. The file is generated alongside the object file during source compilation. Each source compilation generates a separate object file and link-time helper file. When the object files are linked, the compiler is executed again and uses the helper files to optimize code across the separately compiled object files.
; Plugins
: Plugins extend the GCC compiler directly. Plugins allow a stock compiler to be tailored to specific needs by external code loaded as plugins. For example, plugins can add, replace, or even remove middle-end passes operating on &quot;Gimple&quot; representations. Several GCC plugins have already been published, notably:
:* The Python plugin, which links against libpython, and allows one to invoke arbitrary Python scripts from inside the compiler. The aim is to allow GCC plugins to be written in Python.
:* The MELT plugin provides a high-level Lisp-like language to extend GCC.
: The support of plugins was once a contentious issue in 2007.
; C++ transactional memory
: The C++ language has an active proposal for transactional memory. It can be enabled in GCC 6 and newer when compiling with codice_13.
; Unicode identifiers
: Although the C++ language requires support for non-ASCII Unicode characters in identifiers, the feature has only been supported since GCC 10. As with the existing handling of string literals, the source file is assumed to be encoded in UTF-8. The feature is optional in C, but has been made available too since this change.
; C extensions
: GNU C extends the C programming language with several non-standard-features, including nested functions.

The GCJ Java compiler can target either a native machine language architecture or the Java virtual machine&#x27;s Java bytecode. When retargeting GCC to a new platform, bootstrapping is often used. Motorola 68000, Zilog Z80, and other processors are also targeted in the GCC versions developed for various Texas Instruments, Hewlett Packard, Sharp, and Casio programmable graphing calculators.

<text>Aelius Galenus or Claudius Galenus (; September 129 – AD), often anglicized as Galen () or Galen of Pergamon, was a Roman and Greek physician, surgeon, and philosopher. Considered to be one of the most accomplished of all medical researchers of antiquity, Galen influenced the development of various scientific disciplines, including anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, and neurology, as well as philosophy and logic.

The son of Aelius Nicon, a wealthy Greek architect with scholarly interests, Galen received a comprehensive education that prepared him for a successful career as a physician and philosopher. Born in the ancient city of Pergamon (present-day Bergama, Turkey), Galen traveled extensively, exposing himself to a wide variety of medical theories and discoveries before settling in Rome, where he served prominent members of Roman society and eventually was given the position of personal physician to several emperors.

Galen&#x27;s understanding of anatomy and medicine was principally influenced by the then-current theory of the four humors: black bile, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm, as first advanced by the author of &quot;On the Nature of Man&quot; in the Hippocratic corpus. Galen&#x27;s views dominated and influenced Western medical science for more than 1,300 years. His anatomical reports were based mainly on the dissection of Barbary apes. However, when he discovered that their facial expressions were too much like those of humans, he switched to other animals, such as pigs. While dissections and vivisections on humans were practiced in Alexandria by Herophilus and Erasistratus in the 3rd century BCE under Ptolemaic permission, by Galen&#x27;s time these proceedures were strictly forbidden in the Roman Empire. Consequently, Galen had to resort to the dissection and vivisection of animals, particularly barbary apes and pigs, as Aristotle had done centuries earlier for the study of anatomy and physiology. Galen, like others, reasoned that animal anatomy had a strong conciliance with that of humans. Galen would encourage his students to go look at dead gladiators or bodies that washed up in order to get better acquainted with the human body.

Galen&#x27;s theory of the physiology of the circulatory system remained unchallenged until , when Ibn al-Nafis published his book &quot;Sharh tashrih al-qanun li&#x27; Ibn Sina&quot; (&quot;Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna&#x27;s Canon&quot;), in which he reported his discovery of pulmonary circulation. His anatomical reports remained uncontested until 1543, when printed descriptions and illustrations of human dissections were published in the seminal work &quot;De humani corporis fabrica&quot; by Andreas Vesalius, where Galen&#x27;s physiological theory was accommodated to these new observations.

Galen saw himself as both a physician and a philosopher, as he wrote in his treatise titled &quot;That the Best Physician Is Also a Philosopher&quot;. Galen was very interested in the debate between the rationalist and empiricist medical sects, and his use of direct observation, dissection, and vivisection represents a complex middle ground between the extremes of those two viewpoints. Many of his works have been preserved or translated from the original Greek, although many were destroyed and some credited to him are believed to be spurious. Although there is some debate over the date of his death, he was no younger than seventy when he died.

==Biography==
Galen&#x27;s Greek name (&quot;Galēnós&quot;) comes from the adjective (&quot;galēnós&quot;) &#x27;calm&#x27;. Galen&#x27;s Latin name (Aelius or Claudius) implies he had Roman citizenship.

Galen describes his early life in &quot;On the affections of the mind&quot;. He was born in September 129 AD. His father, Aelius Nicon, was a wealthy patrician, an architect and builder, with eclectic interests including philosophy, mathematics, logic, astronomy, agriculture and literature. Galen describes his father as a &quot;highly amiable, just, good and benevolent man&quot;. At that time Pergamon (modern-day Bergama, Turkey) was a major cultural and intellectual centre, noted for its library, second only to that in Alexandria, as well as being the site of a large temple to the healing god Asclepius. The city attracted both Stoic and Platonic philosophers, to whom Galen was exposed at age 14. His studies also took in each of the principal philosophical systems of the time, including Aristotelian and Epicurean. His father had planned a traditional career for Galen in philosophy or politics and took care to expose him to literary and philosophical influences. However, Galen states that in around 145 his father had a dream in which the god Asclepius appeared and commanded Nicon to send his son to study medicine.

===Medical education===
Following his earlier liberal education, Galen at age 16 began his studies at the prestigious local healing temple or asclepeion as a θεραπευτής (&quot;therapeutes&quot;, or attendant) for four years. There he came under the influence of men like Aeschrion of Pergamon, Stratonicus and Satyrus. Asclepiea functioned as spas or sanitoria to which the sick would come to seek the ministrations of the priesthood. Romans frequented the temple at Pergamon in search of medical relief from illness and disease. It was also the haunt of notable people such as the historian Claudius Charax, the orator Aelius Aristides, the sophist Polemo, and the consul Cuspius Rufinus.

Galen&#x27;s father died in 148, leaving Galen independently wealthy at the age of 19. He then followed the advice he found in Hippocrates&#x27; teaching and traveled and studied widely including such destinations as Smyrna (now İzmir), Corinth, Crete, Cilicia (now Çukurova), Cyprus, and finally the great medical school of Alexandria, exposing himself to the various schools of thought in medicine. In 157, aged 28, he returned to Pergamon as physician to the gladiators of the High Priest of Asia, one of the most influential and wealthy men in Asia. Galen claims that the High Priest chose him over other physicians after he eviscerated an ape and challenged other physicians to repair the damage. When they refused, Galen performed the surgery himself and in so doing won the favor of the High Priest of Asia. Over his four years there, he learned the importance of diet, fitness, hygiene, and preventive measures, as well as living anatomy, and the treatment of fractures and severe trauma, referring to their wounds as &quot;windows into the body&quot;. Only five deaths among the gladiators occurred while he held the post, compared to sixty in his predecessor&#x27;s time, a result that is in general ascribed to the attention he paid to their wounds. At the same time he pursued studies in theoretical medicine and philosophy.

===Rome===
Galen went to Rome in 162 and made his mark as a practicing physician. His public demonstrations and impatience with alternative views on medicine brought him into conflict with other doctors practicing in the city. When the Peripatetic philosopher Eudemus became ill with quartan fever, Galen felt obliged to treat him &quot;since he was my teacher and I happened to live nearby&quot;. He wrote: &quot;I return to the case of Eudemus. He was thoroughly attacked by the three attacks of quartan ague, and the doctors had given him up, as it was now mid-winter.&quot; Some Roman physicians criticized Galen for his use of the prognosis in his treatment of Eudemus. This practice conflicted with the then-current standard of care, which relied upon divination and mysticism. Galen retaliated against his detractors by defending his own methods. Garcia-Ballester quotes Galen as saying: &quot;In order to diagnose, one must observe and reason.&quot; This was the basis of his criticism of the doctors who proceeded alogos and askeptos.&quot;

However, Eudemus warned Galen that engaging in conflict with these physicians could lead to his assassination. &quot;Eudemus said this, and more to the same effect; he added that if they were not able to harm me by unscrupulous conduct they would proceed to attempts at poisoning. Among other things he told me that, some ten years before, a young man had come to the city and had given, like me practical demonstrations of the resources of our art; this young man was put to death by poison, together with two servants who accompanied him.&quot; When Galen&#x27;s animosity with the Roman medical practitioners became serious, he feared he might be exiled or poisoned, so he left the city.

Rome was engaged in foreign wars in 161; Marcus Aurelius and his then co-Emperor and adoptive brother Lucius Verus were in the north fighting the Marcomanni. During the autumn of 169 when Roman troops were returning to Aquileia, a great plague, most likely one of the first appearances of smallpox (then referred to as the Antonine Plague) in the Mediterranean world, broke out, and the emperor summoned Galen back to Rome. He was ordered to accompany Marcus and Verus to Germany as the court physician. The following spring Marcus was persuaded to release Galen after receiving a report that Asclepius was against the project. He was left behind to act as physician to the imperial heir Commodus. It was here in court that Galen wrote extensively on medical subjects. Ironically, Lucius Verus died in 169, and Marcus Aurelius himself died in 180, both victims of the plague.

Galen was the physician to Commodus for much of the emperor&#x27;s life and treated his common illnesses. According to Dio Cassius 72.14.3–4, in about 189, under Commodus&#x27; reign, a pestilence occurred which at its height killed 2,000 people a day in Rome. This was most likely the same plague (the so-called &quot;Antonine Plague&quot; and most likely smallpox) that struck Rome during Marcus Aurelius&#x27; reign. Galen was also physician to Septimius Severus during his reign in Rome. He complimented Severus and Caracalla on keeping a supply of drugs for their friends and mentioned three cases in which they had been of use in 198.

===The Antonine Plague===
The Antonine Plague was named after Marcus Aurelius&#x27; family name of Antoninus. It was also known as the Plague of Galen and held an important place in medicinal history because of its association with Galen. He had first-hand knowledge of the disease, and was present in Rome when it first struck in 166, and was also present in the winter of 168–69 during an outbreak among troops stationed at Aquileia. He had experience with the epidemic, referring to it as very long lasting, and described its symptoms and his treatment of it. His references to the plague are scattered and brief. Galen was not trying to present a description of the disease so that it could be recognized in future generations; he was more interested in the treatment and physical effects of the disease. For example, in his writings about a young man afflicted with the plague, he concentrated on the treatment of internal and external ulcerations. According to Niebuhr, &quot;this pestilence must have raged with incredible fury; it carried off innumerable victims. The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted upon it by the plague that visited it in the reign of M. Aurelius.&quot;
The mortality rate of the plague was 7–10 percent; the outbreak in 165–168 would have caused approximately 3.5 to 5 million deaths. Otto Seeck believes that over half the population of the empire perished. J. F. Gilliam believes that the Antonine plague probably caused more deaths than any other epidemic during the empire before the mid-3rd century. Although Galen&#x27;s description is incomplete, it is sufficient to enable a firm identification of the disease as related to smallpox.

Galen notes that the exanthema covered the victim&#x27;s entire body and was usually black. The exanthem became rough and scabby where there was no ulceration. He states that those who were going to survive developed a black exanthem. According to Galen, it was black because of a remnant of blood putrefied in a fever blister that was pustular. His writings state that raised blisters were present in the Antonine plague, usually in the form of a blistery rash. Galen states that the skin rash was close to the one Thucydides described. Galen describes symptoms of the alimentary tract via a patient&#x27;s diarrhea and stools. If the stool was very black, the patient died. He says that the amount of black stools varied. It depended on the severity of the intestinal lesions. He observes that in cases where the stool was not black, the black exanthema appeared. Galen describes the symptoms of fever, vomiting, fetid breath, catarrh, cough, and ulceration of the larynx and trachea.

===Later years===
Galen continued to work and write in his final years, finishing treatises on drugs and remedies as well as his compendium of diagnostics and therapeutics, which would have much influence as a medical text both in the Latin Middle Ages and Medieval Islam.

The 11th-century &quot;Suda&quot; lexicon states that Galen died at the age of 70, which would place his death in about the year 199. However, there is a reference in Galen&#x27;s treatise &quot;On Theriac to Piso&quot; (which may, however, be spurious) to events of 204. There are also statements in Arabic sources that he died in Sicily at age 87, after 17 years studying medicine and 70 practicing it, which would mean he died about 216. According to these sources, the tomb of Galenus in Palermo was still well preserved in the tenth century. Nutton believes that &quot;On Theriac to Piso&quot; is genuine, that the Arabic sources are correct, and that the &quot;Suda&quot; has erroneously interpreted the 70 years of Galen&#x27;s career in the Arabic tradition as referring to his whole lifespan. Boudon-Millot more or less concurs and favors a date of 216.

==Medicine==

Galen contributed a substantial amount to the understanding of pathology. Under the Hippocratic bodily humors theory, differences in human moods come as a consequence of imbalances in one of the four bodily fluids: blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. Galen promoted this theory and the typology of human temperaments. In Galen&#x27;s view, an imbalance of each humor corresponded with a particular human temperament (bloodsanguine, black bilemelancholic, yellow bilecholeric, and phlegmphlegmatic). Thus, individuals with sanguine temperaments are extroverted and social; choleric people have energy, passion, and charisma; melancholics are creative, kind, and considerate; and phlegmatic temperaments are characterised by dependability, kindness, and affection.

Galen was also a skilled surgeon, operating on human patients. Many of his procedures and techniques would not be used again for centuries, such as the procedures he performed on brains and eyes. His surgical experiments included ligating the arteries of living animals. Although many 20th-century historians have claimed that Galen believed the lens to be in the exact center of the eye, Galen actually understood that the crystalline lens is located in the anterior aspect of the human eye.

At first reluctantly but then with increasing vigor, Galen promoted Hippocratic teaching, including venesection and bloodletting, then unknown in Rome. This was sharply criticized by the Erasistrateans, who predicted dire outcomes, believing that it was not blood but &quot;pneuma&quot; that flowed in the veins. Galen, however, staunchly defended venesection in his three books on the subject and in his demonstrations and public disputations. Galen&#x27;s work on anatomy remained largely unsurpassed and unchallenged up until the 16th century in Europe. In the middle of the 16th century, the anatomist Andreas Vesalius challenged the anatomical knowledge of Galen by conducting dissections on human cadavers. These investigations allowed Vesalius to refute aspects of Galen&#x27;s theories regarding anatomy.

===Anatomy===
Galen&#x27;s interest in human anatomy ran afoul of Roman law that prohibited the dissection of human cadavers since roughly 150 BC. Because of this restriction, Galen performed anatomical dissections on living (vivisection) and dead animals, mostly focusing on primates. Galen believed that the anatomical structures of these animals closely mirrored those of humans. Galen clarified the anatomy of the trachea and was the first to demonstrate that the larynx generates the voice. In one experiment, Galen used bellows to inflate the lungs of a dead animal. Galen&#x27;s research on physiology was largely influenced by previous works of philosophers Plato and Aristotle, as well as from the physician Hippocrates. He was one of the first people to use experiments as a method of research for his medical findings. Doing so allowed him to explore various parts of the body and its functions.

Among Galen&#x27;s major contributions to medicine was his work on the circulatory system. He was the first to recognize that there are distinct differences between venous (dark) and arterial (bright) blood. In addition to these discoveries, Galen postulated much more about the nature of the circulatory system. He believed that blood originated in the liver, which follows the teachings of Hippocrates. The liver converted nutrients gathered from ingested food into blood to be used in the circulatory system. The blood created in the liver would eventually flow unidirectionally into the right ventricle of the heart via the great vein. Galen also proposed a theory on how blood receives air from the lungs to be distributed throughout the body. He declared that the venous artery carried air from the lungs into the left ventricle of the heart to mix with created blood from the liver. This same venous artery allowed for an exchange of waste products from the blood back into the lungs to be exhaled. In order to receive air from the lungs in the left ventricle, the new blood needed to get there from the right ventricle. Thus, Galen asserted that there are small holes in the septum dividing the left and right sides of the heart; these holes allowed the blood to pass through easily to receive air and exchange the aforementioned waste products. Although his anatomical experiments on animal models led him to a more complete understanding of the circulatory system, nervous system, respiratory system, and other structures, his work contained scientific errors. Galen believed the circulatory system to consist of two separate one-way systems of distribution, rather than a single unified system of circulation. He believed venous blood to be generated in the liver, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. He posited that arterial blood originated in the heart, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. The blood was then regenerated in either the liver or the heart, completing the cycle. Galen also believed in the existence of a group of blood vessels he called the rete mirabile in the carotid sinus. Both of these theories of the circulation of blood were later (beginning with works of Ibn al-Nafis published ) shown to be incorrect.

Galen was also a pioneer in research about the human spine. His dissections and vivisections of animals led to key observations that helped him accurately describe the human spine, spinal cord, and vertebral column. Galen also played a major role in the discoveries of the central nervous system. He was also able to describe the nerves that emerge from the spine, which is integral to his research about the nervous system. Galen went on to be the first physician to study what happens when the spinal cord is transected on multiple different levels. He worked with pigs and studied their neuroanatomy by severing different nerves either totally or partially to see how it affected the body. He even dealt with diseases affecting the spinal cord and nerves. In his work &quot;De motu musculorum&quot;, Galen explained the difference between motor and sensory nerves, discussed the concept of muscle tone, and explained the difference between agonists and antagonists.

Galen&#x27;s work on animals led to some inaccuracies, most notably his anatomy of the uterus which largely resembled a dog&#x27;s. Though incorrect in his studies of human reproduction and reproductive anatomy, he came very close to identifying the ovaries as analogous to the male testes. Reproduction was a controversial topic in Galen&#x27;s lifetime, as there was much debate over if the male was solely responsible for the seed, or if the woman was also responsible.

Through his vivisection practices, Galen also proved that the voice was controlled by the brain. One of the most famous experiments that he recreated in public was the squealing pig: Galen would cut open a pig, and while it was squealing he would tie off the recurrent laryngeal nerve, or vocal cords, showing they controlled the making of sound. He used the same method to tie off the ureters to prove his theories of kidney and bladder function. Galen believed the human body had three interconnected systems that allowed it to work. The first system that he theorized consisted of the brain and the nerves, responsible for thought and sensation. The second theorized system was the heart and the arteries, which Galen believed to be responsible for providing life-giving energy. The last theorized system was the liver and veins, which Galen theorized were responsible for nutrition and growth. Galen also theorized that blood was made in the liver and sent out around the body.

===Localization of function===
One of Galen&#x27;s major works, &quot;On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato&quot;, sought to demonstrate the unity of the two subjects and their views. Using their theories, combined with Aristotle&#x27;s, Galen developed a tripartite soul consisting of similar aspects. He used the same terms as Plato, referring to the three parts as rational, spiritual, and appetitive. Each corresponded to a localized area of the body. The rational soul was in the brain, the spiritual soul was in the heart, and the appetitive soul was in the liver. Galen was the first scientist and philosopher to assign specific parts of the soul to locations in the body because of his extensive background in medicine. This idea is now referred to as localization of function. Galen&#x27;s assignments were revolutionary for the time period, which set the precedent for future localization theories.

Galen believed each part of this tripartite soul controlled specific functions within the body and that the soul, as a whole, contributed to the health of the body, strengthening the &quot;natural functioning capacity of the organ or organs in question&quot;. The rational soul controlled higher level cognitive functioning in an organism, for example, making choices or perceiving the world and sending those signals to the brain. He also listed &quot;imagination, memory, recollection, knowledge, thought, consideration, voluntary motion, and sensation&quot; as being found within the rational soul. The functions of &quot;growing or being alive&quot; resided in the spirited soul. The spirited soul also contained our passions, such as anger. These passions were considered to be even stronger than regular emotions, and, as a consequence, more dangerous. The third part of the soul, or the appetitive spirit, controlled the living forces in our body, most importantly blood. The appetitive spirit also regulated the pleasures of the body and was moved by feelings of enjoyment. This third part of the soul is the animalistic, or more natural, side of the soul; it deals with the natural urges of the body and survival instincts. Galen proposed that when the soul is moved by too much enjoyment, it reaches states of &quot;incontinence&quot; and &quot;licentiousness&quot;, the inability to willfully cease enjoyment, which was a negative consequence of too much pleasure.

In order to unite his theories about the soul and how it operated within the body, he adapted the theory of the &quot;pneuma&quot;, which he used to explain how the soul operated within its assigned organs, and how those organs, in turn, interacted together. Galen then distinguished the vital &quot;pneuma&quot;, in the arterial system, from the psychic &quot;pneuma&quot;, in the brain and nervous system. Galen placed the vital &quot;pneuma&quot; in the heart and the psychic &quot;pneuma&quot; (&quot;spiritus animalis&quot;) within the brain. He conducted many anatomical studies on animals, most famously an ox, to study the transition from vital to psychic &quot;pneuma&quot;. Although highly criticized for comparing animal anatomy to human anatomy, Galen was convinced that his knowledge was abundant enough in both anatomies to base one on the other.
In his treatise &quot;On the usefulness of the parts of the body&quot;, Galen argued that the perfect suitability of each part of the body to its function indicated the role of an intelligent creator. His creationism was anticipated by the anatomical examples of Socrates and Empedocles.

==Philosophy==

Although the main focus of his work was on medicine, anatomy, and physiology, Galen also wrote about logic and philosophy. His writings were influenced by earlier Greek and Roman thinkers, including Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, and the Pyrrhonists. Galen was concerned to combine philosophical thought with medical practice, as in his brief work &quot;That the Best Physician is also a Philosopher&quot; he took aspects from each group and combined them with his original thought. He regarded medicine as an interdisciplinary field that was best practiced by utilizing theory, observation, and experimentation in conjunction.

Galen combined his observations of his dissections with Plato&#x27;s theory about the soul. Plato believed that the body and the soul were separate entities, rivaling the Stoics. Plato proclaimed that the soul is immortal, so it must exist before one is born, beyond the human body. This influenced Galen&#x27;s thinking that the soul had to be acquired because the soul does not always reside within the human body. Plato&#x27;s influence in Galen&#x27;s model showed itself most prominently in what Galen dubbed arterial blood, which is a mixture of nutritious blood from the liver and the vital spirit (the soul) which was attained from the lungs. The vital spirit within this medium was necessary for the body to function and eventually completely absorbed. This process was then repeated indefinitely, according to Galen, so that the body could be replenished with the soul, or the vital spirit.

Several schools of thought existed within the medical field during Galen&#x27;s lifetime, the main two being the Empiricists and Rationalists (also called Dogmatists or Philosophers), with the Methodists being a smaller group. The Empiricists emphasized the importance of physical practice and experimentation or &quot;active learning&quot; in the medical discipline. In direct opposition to the Empiricists were the Rationalists, who valued the study of established teachings in order to create new theories in the name of medical advancements. The Methodists formed somewhat of a middle ground, as they were not as experimental as the Empiricists, nor as theoretical as the Rationalists. The Methodists mainly utilized pure observation, showing greater interest in studying the natural course of ailments than making efforts to find remedies. Galen&#x27;s education had exposed him to the five major schools of thought (Platonists, Peripatetics, Stoics, Epicureans, Pyrrhonists), with teachers from the Rationalist sect and from the Empiricist sect.

===Opposition to the Stoics===
Galen was well known for his advancements in medicine and the circulatory system, but he was also concerned with philosophy. He developed his own tripartite soul model following the examples of Plato; some scholars refer to him as a Platonist. Galen developed a theory of personality based on his understanding of fluid circulation in humans, and he believed that there was a physiological basis for mental disorders. Galen connected many of his theories to the &quot;pneuma&quot; and he opposed the Stoics&#x27; definition of and use of the &quot;pneuma&quot;.

The Stoics, according to Galen, failed to give a credible answer for the localization of functions of the psyche, or the mind. Through his use of medicine, he was convinced that he came up with a better answer, the brain. The Stoics only recognized the soul as having one part, which was the rational soul and they claimed it would be found in the heart. Galen, following Plato&#x27;s idea, came up with two more parts to the soul.

Galen also rejected Stoic propositional logic and instead embraced a hypothetical syllogistic which was strongly influenced by the Peripatetics and based on elements of Aristotelian logic.

==Psychology==
===Mind–body problem===
Galen believed there is no sharp distinction between the mental and the physical. This was a controversial argument at the time, and Galen agreed with some Greek philosophical schools in believing that the mind and body were not separate faculties. He believed that this could be scientifically shown. This was where his opposition to the Stoics became most prevalent. Galen proposed organs within the body to be responsible for specific functions. According to Galen, the Stoics&#x27; lack of scientific justification discredited their claims of the separateness of mind and body, which is why he spoke so strongly against them. There is an intense scholarly debate about soul–body relations in Galen&#x27;s psychological writings. In his brief treatise &quot;Quod animi mores&quot;, Galen says both that the soul &quot;follows&quot; the mixtures of the body, and that the soul is a bodily mixture. Scholars have offered ways of reconciling these claims, arguing for a materialist reading of Galen&#x27;s philosophy of mind. According to this materialist reading, Galen identifies the soul with the mixtures of the body.

===Psychotherapy===
Another one of Galen&#x27;s major works, &quot;On the Diagnosis and Cure of the Soul&#x27;s Passion&quot;, discussed how to approach and treat psychological problems. This was Galen&#x27;s early attempt at what would later be called psychotherapy. His book contained directions on how to provide counsel to those with psychological issues to prompt them to reveal their deepest passions and secrets, and eventually cure them of their mental deficiency. The leading individual, or therapist, had to be a male, preferably of an older, wiser, age, as well as free from the control of the passions. These passions, according to Galen, caused the psychological problems that people experienced.

==Published works==

Galen may have produced more work than any author in antiquity, rivaling the quantity of work issued from Augustine of Hippo. So profuse was Galen&#x27;s output that the surviving texts represent nearly half of all the extant literature from ancient Greece. It has been reported that Galen employed twenty scribes to write down his words. Galen may have written as many as 500 treatises, amounting to some 10 million words. Although his surviving works amount to some 3 million words, this is thought to represent less than a third of his complete writings. In 191, or more likely in 192, a fire in the Temple of Peace destroyed many of his works, in particular treatises on philosophy.

Because Galen&#x27;s works were not translated into Latin in the ancient period, and because of the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West, the study of Galen, along with the Greek medical tradition as a whole, went into decline in Western Europe during the Early Middle Ages, when very few Latin scholars could read Greek. However, in general, Galen and the ancient Greek medical tradition continued to be studied and followed in the Eastern Roman Empire, commonly known as the Byzantine Empire. All of the extant Greek manuscripts of Galen were copied by Byzantine scholars.

In the Abbasid period (after 750) Arab Muslims began to be interested in Greek scientific and medical texts for the first time, and had some of Galen&#x27;s texts translated into Arabic, often by Syrian Christian scholars (see below). As a result, some texts of Galen exist only in Arabic translation, while others exist only in medieval Latin translations of the Arabic. In some cases scholars have even attempted to translate from the Latin or Arabic back into Greek where the original is lost. For some of the ancient sources, such as Herophilus, Galen&#x27;s account of their work is all that survives.

Even in his own time, forgeries and unscrupulous editions of his work were a problem, prompting him to write &quot;On His Own Books&quot;. Forgeries in Latin, Arabic or Greek continued until the Renaissance. Some of Galen&#x27;s treatises have appeared under many different titles over the years. Sources are often in obscure and difficult-to-access journals or repositories. Although written in Greek, by convention the works are referred to by Latin titles, and often by merely abbreviations of those. No single authoritative collection of his work exists, and controversy remains as to the authenticity of a number of works attributed to Galen. As a consequence, research on Galen&#x27;s work is fraught with hazard.

Various attempts have been made to classify Galen&#x27;s vast output. For instance Coxe (1846) lists a Prolegomena, or introductory books, followed by 7 classes of treatise embracing Physiology (28 vols.), Hygiene (12), Aetiology (19), Semeiotics (14), Pharmacy (10), Blood letting (4), and Therapeutics (17), in addition to 4 of aphorisms, and spurious works. The most complete compendium of Galen&#x27;s writings, surpassing even modern projects like the &quot;&quot;, is the one compiled and translated by Karl Gottlob Kühn of Leipzig between 1821 and 1833. This collection consists of 122 of Galen&#x27;s treatises, translated from the original Greek into Latin (the text is presented in both languages). Over 20,000 pages in length, it is divided into 22 volumes, with 676 index pages. Many of Galen&#x27;s works are included in the &quot;Thesaurus Linguae Graecae&quot;, a digital library of Greek literature started in 1972. Another useful modern source is the French Bibliothèque interuniversitaire de médecine (BIUM).

==Legacy==
===Late antiquity===
In his time, Galen&#x27;s reputation as both physician and philosopher was legendary, the emperor Marcus Aurelius describing him as &quot;Primum sane medicorum esse, philosophorum autem solum&quot; (first among doctors and unique among philosophers &quot;Praen 14: 660&quot;). Other contemporary authors in the Greek world confirm this including Theodotus the Shoemaker, Athenaeus and Alexander of Aphrodisias. The 7th-century poet George of Pisida went so far as to refer to Christ as a second and neglected Galen. Galen continued to exert an important influence over the theory and practice of medicine until the mid-17th century in the Byzantine and Arabic worlds and Europe. A few centuries after Galen, Palladius Iatrosophista stated in his commentary on Hippocrates that Hippocrates sowed and Galen reaped.

Galen summarized and synthesized the work of his predecessors, and it is in Galen&#x27;s words (Galenism) that Greek medicine was handed down to subsequent generations, such that Galenism became the means by which Greek medicine was known to the world. Often, this was in the form of restating and reinterpreting, such as in Magnus of Nisibis&#x27; 4th-century work on urine, which was in turn translated into Arabic. Yet the full importance of his contributions was not appreciated until long after his death. Galen&#x27;s rhetoric and prolificity were so powerful as to convey the impression that there was little left to learn. The term Galenism has subsequently taken on both a positive and pejorative meaning as one that transformed medicine in late antiquity yet so dominated subsequent thinking as to stifle further progress.

After the collapse of the Western Empire the study of Galen and other Greek works almost disappeared in the Latin West. In contrast, in the predominantly Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman empire (Byzantium), many commentators of the subsequent centuries, such as Oribasius, physician to the emperor Julian who compiled a &quot;Synopsis&quot; in the 4th century, preserved and disseminated Galen&#x27;s works, making them more accessible. Nutton refers to these authors as the &quot;medical refrigerators of antiquity&quot;. In late antiquity, medical writing veered increasingly in the direction of the theoretical at the expense of the practical, with many authors merely debating Galenism. Magnus of Nisibis was a pure theorist, as were John of Alexandria and Agnellus of Ravenna with their lectures on Galen&#x27;s &quot;De Sectis&quot;. So strong was Galenism that other authors such as Hippocrates began to be seen through Galen&#x27;s eyes, while his opponents became marginalised and other medical sects such as Asclepiadism slowly disappeared.

Greek medicine was part of Greek culture, and Syrian Christians came in contact with it while the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium) ruled Syria and western Mesopotamia, regions that were conquered in the 7th century by the Arabs. After 750, these Syrian Christians made the first translations of Galen into Syriac and Arabic. From then on, Galen and the Greek medical tradition in general became assimilated into the medieval and early modern Islamic Middle East. Job of Edessa is said to have translated 36 of Galen&#x27;s works into Syriac, some of which were later translated into Arabic by Hunain ibn Ishaq.

===Medieval Islam===

Galen&#x27;s approach to medicine became and remains influential in the Islamic world. The first major translator of Galen into Arabic was the Arab Christian Hunayn ibn Ishaq. He translated () 129 works of &quot;Jalinos&quot; into Arabic. Arabic sources, such as Muhammad ibn Zakarīya al-Rāzi (AD 865–925), continue to be the source of discovery of new or relatively inaccessible Galenic writings. One of Hunayn&#x27;s Arabic translations, &quot;Kitab ila Aglooqan fi Shifa al Amrad&quot;, which is extant in the Library of Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine &amp; Sciences, is regarded as a masterpiece of Galen&#x27;s literary works. A part of the Alexandrian compendium of Galen&#x27;s work, this 10th-century manuscript comprises two parts that include details regarding various types of fevers (Humyat) and different inflammatory conditions of the body. More important is that it includes details of more than 150 single and compound formulations of both herbal and animal origin. The book provides an insight into understanding the traditions and methods of treatment in the Greek and Roman eras. In addition, this book provides a direct source for the study of more than 150 single and compound drugs used during the Greco-Roman period.

As the title of &quot;Doubts on Galen&quot; by al-Rāzi implies, as well as the writings of physicians such as Ibn Zuhr and Ibn al-Nafis, the works of Galen were not accepted unquestioningly, but as a challengeable basis for further inquiry. A strong emphasis on experimentation and empiricism led to new results and new observations, which were contrasted and combined with those of Galen by writers such as al-Rāzi, Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi, Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Zuhr, and Ibn al-Nafis. For example, Ibn al-Nafis&#x27; discovery of the pulmonary circulation contradicted the Galenic theory on the heart.

The influence of Galen&#x27;s writings, including humorism, remains strong in modern Unani medicine, now closely identified with Islamic culture, and widely practiced from India (where it is officially recognized) to Morocco.
Maimonides was influenced by Galen, whom he cited most often in his medical works, and whom he considered to be the greatest physician of all time. In India many Hindu physicians studied Persian and Urdu languages and learnt Galenic medicine. This trend of studies among Hindu physicians began in the 17th century and lasted until the early 20th century (Speziale 2018).

===Middle Ages===
From the 11th century onwards, Latin translations of Islamic medical texts began to appear in the West, alongside the Salerno school of thought, and were soon incorporated into the curriculum at the universities of Naples and Montpellier. From that time, Galenism took on a new, unquestioned authority, Galen even being referred to as the &quot;Medical Pope of the Middle Ages&quot;. Constantine the African was amongst those who translated both Hippocrates and Galen from Arabic. In addition to the more numerous translations of Arabic texts in this period, there were a few translations of Galenic works directly from the Greek, such as Burgundio of Pisa&#x27;s translation of &quot;De complexionibus&quot;. Galen&#x27;s works on anatomy and medicine became the mainstay of the medieval physician&#x27;s university curriculum, alongside Ibn Sina&#x27;s &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;, which elaborated on Galen&#x27;s works. Unlike pagan Rome, Christian Europe did not exercise a universal prohibition of the dissection and autopsy of the human body and such examinations were carried out regularly from at least the 13th century. However, Galen&#x27;s influence was so great that when dissections discovered anomalies compared with Galen&#x27;s anatomy, the physicians often tried to fit these into the Galenic system. An example of this is Mondino de Liuzzi, who describes rudimentary blood circulation in his writings but still asserts that the left ventricle should contain air. Some cited these changes as proof that human anatomy had changed since the time of Galen.

The most important translator of Galen&#x27;s works into Latin was Niccolò di Deoprepio da Reggio, who spent several years working on Galen. Niccolò worked at the Angevin Court during the reign of king Robert of Naples. Among Niccolò&#x27;s translations is a piece from a medical treatise by Galen, of which the original text is lost.

===Renaissance===
The first edition of Galen&#x27;s complete works in Latin translation was edited by Diomede Bonardo of Brescia and printed at Venice by Filippo Pinzi in 1490.

The Renaissance, and the fall of the Byzantine Empire (1453), were accompanied by an influx of Greek scholars and manuscripts to the West, allowing direct comparison between the Arabic commentaries and the original Greek texts of Galen. This New Learning and the Humanist movement, particularly the work of Linacre, promoted &quot;literae humaniores&quot; including Galen in the Latin scientific canon, &quot;De Naturalibus Facultatibus&quot; appearing in London in 1523. Debates on medical science now had two traditions, the more conservative Arabian and the liberal Greek. The more extreme liberal movements began to challenge the role of authority in medicine, as exemplified by Paracelsus&#x27; symbolically burning the works of Avicenna and Galen at his medical school in Basel. Nevertheless, Galen&#x27;s pre-eminence amongst the great thinkers of the millennium is exemplified by a 16th-century mural in the refectory of the Great Lavra of Mt Athos. It depicts pagan sages at the foot of the Tree of Jesse, with Galen between the Sibyl and Aristotle.

Galenism&#x27;s final defeat came from a combination of the negativism of Paracelsus and the constructivism of the Italian Renaissance anatomists, such as Vesalius in the 16th century. In the 1530s, the Flemish anatomist and physician Andreas Vesalius took on a project to translate many of Galen&#x27;s Greek texts into Latin. Vesalius&#x27; most famous work, &quot;De humani corporis fabrica&quot;, was greatly influenced by Galenic writing and form. Seeking to examine critically Galen&#x27;s methods and outlook, Vesalius turned to human cadaver dissection as a means of verification. Galen&#x27;s writings were shown by Vesalius to describe details present in monkeys but not in humans, and he demonstrated Galen&#x27;s limitations through books and hands-on demonstrations despite fierce opposition from orthodox pro-Galenists such as Jacobus Sylvius. Since Galen states that he is using observations of monkeys (human dissection was prohibited) to give an account of what the body looks like, Vesalius could portray himself as using Galen&#x27;s approach of description of direct observation to create a record of the exact details of the human body, since he worked in a time when human dissection was allowed. Galen argued that monkey anatomy was close enough to humans for physicians to learn anatomy with monkey dissections and then make observations of similar structures in the wounds of their patients, rather than trying to learn anatomy only from wounds in human patients, as would be done by students trained in the Empiricist model. The examinations of Vesalius also disproved medical theories of Aristotle and Mondino de Liuzzi. One of the best known examples of Vesalius&#x27; overturning of Galenism was his demonstration that the interventricular septum of the heart was not permeable, as Galen had taught (&quot;Nat Fac III xv&quot;). However, this had been revealed two years before by Michael Servetus in his fateful &quot;Christianismi restitutio&quot; (1553) with only three copies of the book surviving, but these remained hidden for decades; the rest were burned shortly after its publication because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities.

Michael Servetus, using the name &quot;Michel de Villeneuve&quot; during his stay in France, was Vesalius&#x27; fellow student and the best Galenist at the University of Paris, according to Johann Winter von Andernach, who taught both. In the Galenism of the Renaissance, editions of the &quot;Opera Omnia&quot; by Galen were very important, beginning from the Aldine Press&#x27; editio princeps in Venice in 1525. It was followed in Venice in 1541–1542 by the Giunta. There were fourteen editions of the book from that date until 1625. Just one edition was produced from Lyon between 1548 and 1551. The Lyon edition has commentaries on breathing and blood streaming that correct the work of earlier renowned authors such as Vesalius, Caius, or Janus Cornarius. &quot;Michel De Villeneuve&quot; had contracts with Jean Frellon for that work, and the Servetus scholar-researcher Francisco Javier González Echeverría presented research that became an accepted communication in the International Society for the History of Medicine, which concluded that Michael De Villeneuve (Michael Servetus) is the author of the commentaries of this edition of Frellon, in Lyon.

Another convincing case where understanding of the body was extended beyond where Galen had left it came from these demonstrations of the nature of human circulation and the subsequent work of Andrea Cesalpino, Fabricio of Acquapendente, and William Harvey. Some Galenic teaching, such as his emphasis on bloodletting as a remedy for many ailments, however, remained influential until well into the 19th century.

===Contemporary scholarship===
Galenic scholarship remains an intense and vibrant field, with interest in Galen&#x27;s work bolstered by the German encyclopedia &quot;Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft&quot;.

Copies of his works translated by Robert M. Green are held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.

In 2018, the University of Basel discovered that a mysterious Greek papyrus with mirror writing on both sides, which is in the collection of Basilius Amerbach, a professor of jurisprudence at the university in the 16th century, is an unknown medical document of Galen or an unknown commentary on his work. The medical text describes the phenomenon of &quot;hysterical apnea&quot;.

<text>Speaking in tongues, also known as glossolalia, is an activity or practice in which people utter words or speech-like sounds, often thought by believers to be languages unknown to the speaker. One definition used by linguists is the fluid vocalizing of speech-like syllables that lack any readily comprehensible meaning. In some cases, as part of religious practice, some believe it to be a divine language unknown to the speaker. Glossolalia is practiced in Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity, as well as in other religions.

Sometimes a distinction is made between &quot;glossolalia&quot; and &quot;xenolalia&quot; or &quot;xenoglossy&quot;, which specifically relates to the belief that the language being spoken is a natural language previously unknown to the speaker.

==Etymology==
&quot;Glossolalia&quot; is a borrowing of the (), which is a compound of the () and () . The Greek expression (in various forms) appears in the New Testament in the books of Acts and First Corinthians. In Acts 2, the followers of Christ receive the Holy Spirit and speak in the languages of at least fifteen countries or ethnic groups.

The exact phrase &quot;speaking in tongues&quot; has been used at least since the translation of the New Testament into Middle English in the Wycliffe Bible in the 14th century. Frederic Farrar first used the word &quot;glossolalia&quot; in 1879.

==Linguistics==
In 1972, William J. Samarin, a linguist from the University of Toronto, published a thorough assessment of Pentecostal glossolalia that became a classic work on its linguistic characteristics. His assessment was based on a large sample of glossolalia recorded in public and private Christian meetings in Italy, the Netherlands, Jamaica, Canada, and the United States over the course of five years; his wide range of subjects included the Puerto Ricans of the Bronx, the snake handlers of the Appalachians and the spiritual Christians from Russia in Los Angeles (&quot;Pryguny, Dukh-i-zhizniki&quot;).

Samarin found that glossolalic speech does resemble human language in some respects. The speaker uses accent, rhythm, intonation and pauses to break up the speech into distinct units. Each unit is itself made up of syllables, the syllables being formed from consonants and vowels found in a language known to the speaker:

It is verbal behaviour that consists of using a certain number of consonants and vowels ... in a limited number of syllables that in turn are organized into larger units that are taken apart and rearranged pseudogrammatically ... with variations in pitch, volume, speed and intensity.

[Glossolalia] consists of strings of syllables, made up of sounds taken from all those that the speaker knows, put together more or less haphazardly but emerging nevertheless as word-like and sentence-like units because of realistic, language-like rhythm and melody.

That the sounds are taken from the set of sounds already known to the speaker is confirmed by others. Felicitas Goodman, a psychological anthropologist and linguist, also found that the speech of glossolalists reflected the patterns of speech of the speaker&#x27;s native language. These findings were confirmed by Kavan (2004).

Samarin found that the resemblance to human language was merely on the surface and so concluded that glossolalia is &quot;only a facade of language&quot;. He reached this conclusion because the syllable string did not form words, the stream of speech was not internally organized, and – most importantly of all – there was no systematic relationship between units of speech and concepts. Humans use language to communicate but glossolalia does not. Therefore, he concluded that glossolalia is not &quot;a specimen of human language because it is neither internally organized nor systematically related to the world man perceives&quot;. On the basis of his linguistic analysis, Samarin defined Pentecostal glossolalia as &quot;meaningless but phonologically structured human utterance, believed by the speaker to be a real language but bearing no systematic resemblance to any natural language, living or dead&quot;.

Felicitas Goodman studied a number of Pentecostal communities in the United States, the Caribbean, and Mexico; these included English-, Spanish- and Mayan-speaking groups. She compared what she found with recordings of non-Christian rituals from Africa, Borneo, Indonesia and Japan. She took into account both the segmental structure (such as sounds, syllables, phrases) and the supra-segmental elements (rhythm, accent, intonation) and concluded that there was no distinction between what was practised by the Pentecostal Protestants and the followers of other religions.

==History==

===Classical antiquity===
It was a commonplace idea within the Ancient world that divine beings spoke languages different from human languages, and historians of religion have identified references to esoteric speech in Greco-Roman literature that resemble glossolalia, sometimes explained as angelic or divine language. An example is the account in the Testament of Job, a non-canonical elaboration of the Book of Job, where the daughters of Job are described as being given sashes enabling them to speak and sing in angelic languages.

According to Dale B. Martin, glossolalia was accorded high status in the ancient world due to its association with the divine. Alexander of Abonoteichus may have exhibited glossolalia during his episodes of prophetic ecstasy. Neoplatonist philosopher Iamblichus linked glossolalia to prophecy, writing that prophecy was divine spirit possession that &quot;emits words which are not understood by those that utter them; for they pronounce them, as it is said, with an insane mouth (&quot;mainomenό stomati&quot;) and are wholly subservient, and entirely yield themselves to the energy of the predominating God&quot;.

In his writings on early Christianity, the Greek philosopher Celsus includes an account of Christian glossolalia. Celsus describes prophecies made by several Christians in Palestine and Phoenicia of which he writes, &quot;Having brandished these threats they then go on to add incomprehensible, incoherent, and utterly obscure utterances, the meaning of which no intelligent person could discover: for they are meaningless and nonsensical, and give a chance for any fool or sorcerer to take the words in whatever sense he likes&quot;.

References to speaking in tongues by the Church fathers are rare. Except for Irenaeus&#x27; 2nd-century reference to many in the church speaking all kinds of languages &quot;through the Spirit&quot;, and Tertullian&#x27;s reference in 207 AD to the spiritual gift of interpretation of tongues being encountered in his day, there are no other known first-hand accounts of glossolalia, and very few second-hand accounts among their writings.

===1100 to 1900===
* 12th century – Bernard of Clairvaux explained that speaking tongues was no longer present because there were greater miracles – the transformed lives of believers.
* 12th century – Hildegard of Bingen is said to have possessed the gift of visions and prophecy and to have been able to speak and write in Latin without having learned the language.
* 1265 – Thomas Aquinas wrote about the gift of tongues in the New Testament, which he understood to be an ability to speak every language, given for the purposes of missionary work. He explained that Christ did not have this gift because his mission was to the Jews, &quot;nor does each one of the faithful now speak save in one tongue&quot;; for &quot;no one speaks in the tongues of all nations, because the Church herself already speaks the languages of all nations&quot;.
* 15th century – The Moravians are referred to by detractors as having spoken in tongues. John Roche, a contemporary critic, claimed that the Moravians &quot;commonly broke into some disconnected Jargon, which they often passed upon the vulgar, &#x27;as the exuberant and resistless Evacuations of the Spirit&#x27;&quot;.
* 17th century – The French Prophets: The Camisards also spoke sometimes in languages that were unknown: &quot;Several persons of both Sexes&quot;, James Du Bois of Montpellier recalled, &quot;I have heard in their Extasies pronounce certain words, which seem&#x27;d to the Standers-by, to be some Foreign Language&quot;. These utterances were sometimes accompanied by the gift of interpretation exercised, in Du Bois&#x27; experience, by the same person who had spoken in tongues.
* 17th century – Early Quakers, such as Edward Burrough, make mention of tongues-speaking in their meetings: &quot;We spoke with new tongues, as the Lord gave us utterance, and His Spirit led us&quot;.
* 1817 – In Germany, Gustav von Below, an aristocratic officer of the Prussian Guard, and his brothers, founded a religious movement based on their estates in Pomerania, which may have included speaking in tongues.
* 19th century – Edward Irving and the Catholic Apostolic Church. Edward Irving, a minister in the Church of Scotland, writes of a woman who would &quot;speak at great length, and with superhuman strength, in an unknown tongue, to the great astonishment of all who heard, and to her own great edification and enjoyment in God&quot;. Irving further stated that &quot;tongues are a great instrument for personal edification, however mysterious it may seem to us&quot;.
* 19th century – The history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), contains extensive references to the practice of speaking in tongues by Brigham Young, Joseph Smith and many others. Sidney Rigdon had disagreements with Alexander Campbell regarding speaking in tongues, and later joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Speaking in tongues was recorded in contemporary sources, both hostile and sympathetic to Mormonism, by at least 1830. The practice was soon widespread amongst Mormons, with many rank and file church members believing they were speaking the language of Adam; some of the hostility towards Mormons stemmed from those of other faiths regarding speaking in tongues unfavorably, especially when practiced by children. At the 1836 dedication of the Kirtland Temple the dedicatory prayer asked that God grant them the gift of tongues and at the end of the service Brigham Young spoke in tongues, another elder interpreted it and then gave his own exhortation in tongues. Many other worship experiences in the Kirtland Temple prior to and after the dedication included references to people speaking and interpreting tongues. In describing the beliefs of the church in the Wentworth letter (1842), Joseph Smith identified a belief of the &quot;gift of tongues&quot; and &quot;interpretation of tongues&quot;. The practice of glossolalia by the Latter-day Saints was widespread but after an initial burst of enthusiastic growth circa 1830–34, seems to have been somewhat more restrained than in many other contemporary religious movements. Young, Smith, and numerous other early leaders frequently cautioned against the public exercise of glossolalia unless there be someone who could exercise the corresponding spiritual gift of interpretation of tongues, so that listeners could be edified by what had been said. Although the Latter-day Saints believe that speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues is alive and well in the Church, modern Mormons are much more likely to point to the way in which LDS missionaries are trained and learn foreign languages quickly, and are able to communicate rapidly on their missions, as evidence of the manifestation of this gift. This interpretation stems from a 1900 General Conference sermon by Joseph F. Smith which discouraged glossolalia; subsequent leaders echoed this recommendation for about a decade afterwards and subsequently the practice had largely died out amongst Mormons by the 1930s and &#x27;40s.

===20th century===
During the 20th century, glossolalia primarily became associated with Pentecostalism and the later charismatic movement. Preachers in the Holiness Movement preachers Charles Parham and William Seymour are credited as co-founders of the movement. Parham and Seymour taught that &quot;baptism of the Holy Spirit was not the blessing of sanctification but rather a third work of grace that was accompanied by the experience of tongues&quot;. It was Parham who formulated the doctrine of &quot;initial evidence&quot;. After studying the Bible, Parham came to the conclusion that speaking in tongues was the Bible evidence that one had received the baptism with the Holy Spirit.

In 1900, Parham opened Bethel Bible College in Topeka, Kansas, America, where he taught initial evidence, a Charismatic belief about how to initiate the practice. During a service on 1 January 1901, a student named Agnes Ozman asked for prayer and the laying on of hands to specifically ask God to fill her with the Holy Spirit. She became the first of many students to experience glossolalia, in the first hours of the 20th century. Parham followed within the next few days. Parham called his new movement the apostolic faith. In 1905, he moved to Houston and opened a Bible school there. One of his students was William Seymour, an African-American preacher. In 1906, Seymour traveled to Los Angeles where his preaching ignited the Azusa Street Revival. This revival is considered the birth of the global Pentecostal movement. According to the first issue of William Seymour&#x27;s newsletter, &quot;The Apostolic Faith&quot;, from 1906:

Parham and his early followers believed that speaking in tongues was xenoglossia, and some followers traveled to foreign countries and tried to use the gift to share the Gospel with non-English-speaking people. From the time of the Azusa Street revival and among early participants in the Pentecostal movement, there were many accounts of individuals hearing their own languages spoken &#x27;in tongues&#x27;. The majority of Pentecostals and Charismatics consider speaking in tongues to primarily be divine, or the &quot;language of angels&quot;, rather than human languages. In the years following the Azusa Street revival Pentecostals who went to the mission field found that they were unable to speak in the language of the local inhabitants at will when they spoke in tongues in strange lands.

The revival at Azusa Street lasted until around 1915. From it grew many new Pentecostal churches as people visited the services in Los Angeles and took their newfound beliefs to communities around the United States and abroad. During the 20th century, glossolalia became an important part of the identity of these religious groups. During the 1960s, the charismatic movement within the mainline Protestant churches and among charismatic Roman Catholics adopted some Pentecostal beliefs, and the practice of glossolalia spread to other Christian denominations. The discussion regarding tongues has permeated many branches of Protestantism, particularly since the widespread charismatic movement in the 1960s. Many books have been published either defending or attacking the practice.

==Christianity==

===Theological explanations===
In Christianity, a supernatural explanation for glossolalia is advocated by some and rejected by others. Proponents of each viewpoint use the biblical writings and historical arguments to support their positions.
* Glossolalists could, apart from those practicing glossolalia, also mean all those Christians who believe that the Pentecostal/charismatic glossolalia practiced today is the &quot;speaking in tongues&quot; described in the New Testament. They believe that it is a miraculous charism or spiritual gift. Glossolalists claim that these tongues can be both real, unlearned languages (i.e., xenoglossia) as well as a &quot;language of the spirit&quot;, a &quot;heavenly language&quot;, or perhaps the language of angels.
* Cessationists believe that all the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit ceased to occur early in Christian history, and therefore that the speaking in tongues as practiced by Charismatic Christians is the learned utterance of non-linguistic syllables. According to this belief, it is neither xenoglossia nor miraculous, but rather taught behavior, possibly self-induced. These believe that what the New Testament described as &quot;speaking in tongues&quot; was xenoglossia, a miraculous spiritual gift through which the speaker could communicate in natural languages not previously studied.
*A third position claims that glossolalia does exist, but it is a form of prelest, not the &quot;speaking in tongues&quot; described in the New Testament. It believes glossolalia is part of a mediumistic technique where practitioners are manifesting genuine spiritual power, but this power is not necessarily of the Holy Spirit.
* A fourth position conceivably exists, which believes the practice of &quot;glossolalia&quot; to be a folk practice and different from the legitimate New Testament spiritual gift of speaking/interpreting real languages. It is therefore not out of a belief that &quot;miracles have ceased&quot; (i.e., cessationism) that causes this group to discredit the supernatural origins of particular modern expressions of &quot;glossolalia&quot;, but it is rather out of a belief that glossolalists have misunderstood Scripture and wrongly attributed to the Holy Spirit something that may be explained naturalistically.

===Biblical practice===
There are five places in the New Testament where speaking in tongues is referred to explicitly:
* (though this is a disputed text), which records the instructions of Christ to the apostles, including his description that &quot;they will speak with new tongues&quot; as a sign that would follow &quot;them that believe&quot; in him.
* , which describes an occurrence of speaking in tongues in Jerusalem at Pentecost, though with various interpretations. Specifically, &quot;every man &quot;heard them&quot; speak in his own language&quot; and wondered &quot;how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?&quot;
* , when the household of Cornelius in Caesarea spoke in tongues, and those present compared it to the speaking in tongues that occurred at Pentecost.
* , when a group of approximately a dozen men spoke in tongues in Ephesus as they received the Holy Spirit while the apostle Paul laid his hands upon them.
* , , , where Paul discusses speaking in &quot;various kinds of tongues&quot; as part of his wider discussion of the gifts of the Spirit; his remarks shed some light on his own speaking in tongues as well as how the gift of speaking in tongues was to be used in the church.

Other verses by inference may be considered to refer to &quot;speaking in tongues&quot;, such as , and .

The biblical account of Pentecost in the second chapter of the book of Acts describes the sound of a mighty rushing wind and &quot;divided tongues like fire&quot; coming to rest on the apostles. The text further describes that &quot;they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other languages&quot;. It goes on to say in verses 5–11 that when the Apostles spoke, each person in attendance &quot;heard their own language being spoken&quot;. Therefore, the gift of speaking in tongues refers to the Apostles&#x27; speaking languages that the people listening heard as &quot;them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God&quot;. Glossolalists and cessationists both recognize this as xenoglossia, a miraculous ability that marked their baptism in the Holy Spirit. Something similar (although perhaps not xenoglossia) took place on at least two subsequent occasions, in Caesarea and Ephesus.

Glossolalists and cessationists generally agree that the primary purpose of the gift of speaking in tongues was to mark the Holy Spirit being poured out. At Pentecost the Apostle Peter declared that this gift, which was making some in the audience ridicule the disciples as drunks, be the fulfilment of the prophecy of Joel, which described that God would pour out his Spirit on all flesh ().

Despite these commonalities, there are significant variations in interpretation.
* Universal. The traditional Pentecostal view is that every Christian should expect to be baptized in the Holy Spirit, the distinctive mark of which is glossolalia. While most Protestants agree that baptism in the Holy Spirit is integral to being a Christian, others believe that it is not separable from conversion and no longer marked by glossolalia. Pentecostals appeal to the declaration of the Apostle Peter at Pentecost, that &quot;the gift of the Holy Spirit&quot; was &quot;for you and for your children and for all who are far off&quot; (). Cessationists reply that the gift of speaking in tongues was never for all (). In response to those who say that the baptism in the Holy Spirit be not a separate experience from conversion, Pentecostals appeal to the question asked by the Apostle Paul to the Ephesian believers &quot;Have ye received the Holy Ghost &quot;since&quot; ye believed?&quot; ().
* One gift. Different aspects of speaking in tongues appear in Acts and 1 Corinthians, such that the Assemblies of God declare that the gift in Acts &quot;is the same in essence as the gift of tongues&quot; in 1 Corinthians &quot;but different in purpose and use&quot;. They distinguish between (private) speech in tongues when receiving the gift of the Spirit, and (public) speech in tongues for the benefit of the church. Others assert that the gift in Acts was &quot;not a different phenomenon&quot; but the same gift being displayed under varying circumstances. The same description&quot;speaking in tongues&quot;is used in both Acts and 1 Corinthians, and in both cases the speech is in an unlearned language.
* Direction. The New Testament describes tongues largely as speech addressed to God, but also as something that can potentially be interpreted into human language, thereby &quot;edifying the hearers&quot; (). At Pentecost and Caesarea the speakers were praising God (; ). Paul referred to praying, singing praise, and giving thanks in tongues (), as well as to the interpretation of tongues (), and instructed those speaking in tongues to pray for the ability to interpret their tongues so that others could understand them (). While some people limit speaking in tongues to speech addressed to God&quot;prayer or praise&quot;, others claim that speaking in tongues be the revelation from God to the church, and when interpreted into human language by those embued with the gift of interpretation of tongues for the benefit of others present, may be considered equivalent to prophecy.
* Music. Musical interludes of glossolalia are sometimes described as singing in the Spirit. Some hold that singing in the Spirit is identified with singing in tongues in 1 Corinthians 14:13–19, which they hold to be &quot;spiritual or spirited singing&quot;, as opposed to &quot;communicative or impactive singing&quot; which Paul refers to as &quot;singing with the understanding&quot;.
* Sign for unbelievers (). Some assume that tongues are &quot;a sign for unbelievers that they might believe&quot;, and so advocate it as a means of evangelism. Others point out that Paul quotes Isaiah to show that &quot;when God speaks to people in language they cannot understand, it is quite evidently a sign of God&#x27;s judgment&quot;; so if unbelievers are baffled by a church service they cannot understand because tongues are spoken without being interpreted, that is a &quot;sign of God&#x27;s attitude&quot;, &quot;a sign of judgment&quot;. Some identify the tongues in Acts 2 as the primary example of tongues as signs for unbelievers.
* Comprehension. Some say that speaking in tongues was &quot;not understood by the speaker&quot;. Others assert that &quot;the tongues-speaker normally understood his own foreign-language message&quot;. This last comment seems to have been made by someone confusing the &quot;gift of tongues&quot; with the &quot;gift of the interpretation of tongues&quot; , which is specified as a different gift in the New Testament, but one that can be given to a person who also has the gift of tongues. In that case, a person understands a message in tongues that he has previously spoken in an unknown language.

===Pentecostal and charismatic practices===

Baptism with the Holy Spirit is regarded by the Holiness Pentecostals as being the third work of grace, following the new birth (first work of grace) and entire sanctification (second work of grace). Holiness Pentecostals teach that this third work of grace is accompanied with glossolalia.

Because Pentecostal and charismatic beliefs are not monolithic, there is not complete theological agreement on speaking in tongues. Generally, followers believe that speaking in tongues is a spiritual gift that can be manifested as either a human language or a heavenly supernatural language in three ways:
* The &quot;sign of tongues&quot; refers to xenoglossia, wherein followers believe someone is speaking a language they have never learned.
* The &quot;gift of tongues&quot; refers to a glossolalic utterance spoken by an individual and addressed to a congregation of, typically, other believers.
* &quot;Praying in the spirit&quot; is typically used to refer to glossolalia as part of personal prayer.
Many Pentecostals and charismatics quote Paul&#x27;s words in 1 Corinthians 14 which established guidelines on the public use of glossolalia in the church at Corinth although the exegesis of this passage and the extent to which these instructions are followed is a matter of academic debate.

The gift of tongues is often referred to as a &quot;message in tongues&quot;. Practitioners believe that this use of glossolalia requires an interpretation so that the gathered congregation can understand the message, which is accomplished by the interpretation of tongues. There are two schools of thought concerning the nature of a message in tongues:
* One school of thought believes it is always directed &quot;to&quot; God as prayer, praise, or thanksgiving but is spoken in for the hearing and edification of the congregation.
* The other school of thought believes that a message in tongues can be a prophetic utterance inspired by the Holy Spirit. In this case, the speaker delivers a message to the congregation on behalf of God.

In addition to praying in the Spirit, many Pentecostal and charismatic churches practice what is known as singing in the Spirit.

===Interpretation of tongues===

In Christian theology, the &quot;interpretation of tongues&quot; is one of the spiritual gifts listed in 1 Corinthians 12. This gift is used in conjunction with that of the gift of tonguesthe supernatural ability to speak in a language (tongue) unknown to the speaker. The gift of interpretation is the supernatural enablement to express in an intelligible language an utterance spoken in an unknown tongue. This is not learned but imparted by the Holy Spirit; therefore, it should not be confused with the acquired skill of language interpretation. While cessationist Christians believe that this miraculous charism has ceased, Charismatic and Pentecostal Christians believe that this gift continues to operate within the church. Much of what is known about this gift was recorded by St. Paul in 1 Corinthians 14. In this passage, guidelines for the proper use of the gift of tongues were given. In order for the gift of tongues to be beneficial to the edification of the church, such supernatural utterances were to be interpreted into the language of the gathered Christians. If no one among the gathered Christians possessed the gift of interpretation, then the gift of tongues was not to be publicly exercised. Those possessing the gift of tongues were encouraged to pray for the ability to interpret.

==Non-Christian practice==
Other religious groups have been observed to practice some form of theopneustic glossolalia. It is perhaps most commonly in Paganism, Shamanism, and other mediumistic religious practices. In Japan, the God Light Association believed that glossolalia could cause adherents to recall past lives.

Glossolalia has been postulated as an explanation for the Voynich manuscript.

In the 19th century, Spiritism was developed by the work of Allan Kardec, and the practice was seen as one of the self-evident manifestations of spirits. Spiritists argued that some cases were actually cases of xenoglossia.

==Medical research==
In most cases tongues speakers have no underlying neuropsychiatric disorder precipitating the manifestations, although it rarely occurs in neurogenic conditions. Speakers report finding personal meaning in the utterances, although they are unintelligible and have no linguistic structure. The link to psychopathology has been disproven - tongues speakers are not over-represented in those with depression or psychosis, nor other disorders and one study found tongues speaking negatively associated with neuroticism - emotional stability was greater amongst the speakers. Nevertheless the language spoken by the speakers is devoid of semantic meaning, although the utterances appear to be derived from the language of the speaker. Studies have thus suggested this could be learned behaviour by the speakers.

Neuroimaging of brain activity during glossolalia does not show activity in the language areas of the brain. In other words, it may be characterized by a specific brain activity.

A 1973 experimental study highlighted the existence of two basic types of glossolalia: a static form which tends to a somewhat coaction to repetitiveness and a more dynamic one which tends to free association of speech-like elements.

A study done by the &quot;American Journal of Human Biology&quot; found that speaking in tongues is associated with both a reduction in circulatory cortisol, and enhancements in alpha-amylase enzyme activitytwo common biomarkers of stress reduction that can be measured in saliva. Several sociological studies report various social benefits of engaging in Pentecostal glossolalia, such as an increase in self-confidence.

As of April 2021, further studies are needed to corroborate the 1980s view of glossolaly with more sensitive measures of outcome, by using the more recent techniques of neuroimaging. 

==Cessationism==
Various Christian groups have criticized the Pentecostal and charismatic movement for paying too much attention to mystical manifestations, such as glossolalia. In certain evangelical and other Protestant Churches, this experience was understood as a gift to speak foreign languages without having learned them (xenoglossy) for evangelization, and cessationism is the theological position that argues that this and other spiritual gifts were meant only for the apostolic age, and thereafter withdrawn.

<text>Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (; 12 March 1824 – 17 October 1887) was a German chemist, mathematician and physicist who contributed to the fundamental understanding of electrical circuits, spectroscopy and the emission of black-body radiation by heated objects. He also coined the term &quot;black body&quot; in 1860.

Several different sets of concepts are named &quot;Kirchhoff&#x27;s laws&quot; after him, which include Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws, Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation, and Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermochemistry.

The Bunsen–Kirchhoff Award for spectroscopy is named after Kirchhoff and his colleague, Robert Bunsen.

== Life and work ==
Gustav Kirchhoff was born on 12 March 1824 in Königsberg, Prussia, the son of Friedrich Kirchhoff, a lawyer, and Johanna Henriette Wittke. His family were Lutherans in the Evangelical Church of Prussia. He graduated from the Albertus University of Königsberg in 1847 where he attended the mathematico-physical seminar directed by Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, Franz Ernst Neumann and Friedrich Julius Richelot. In the same year, he moved to Berlin, where he stayed until he received a professorship at Breslau. Later, in 1857, he married Clara Richelot, the daughter of his mathematics professor Richelot. The couple had five children. Clara died in 1869. He married Luise Brömmel in 1872.
Kirchhoff formulated his circuit laws, which are now ubiquitous in electrical engineering, in 1845, while he was still a student. He completed this study as a seminar exercise; it later became his doctoral dissertation. He was called to the University of Heidelberg in 1854, where he collaborated in spectroscopic work with Robert Bunsen. In 1857, he calculated that an electric signal in a resistanceless wire travels along the wire at the speed of light. He proposed his law of thermal radiation in 1859, and gave a proof in 1861. Together Kirchhoff and Bunsen invented the spectroscope, which Kirchhoff used to pioneer the identification of the elements in the Sun, showing in 1859 that the Sun contains sodium. He and Bunsen discovered caesium and rubidium in 1861. At Heidelberg he ran a mathematico-physical seminar, modelled on Franz Ernst Neumann&#x27;s, with the mathematician Leo Koenigsberger. Among those who attended this seminar were Arthur Schuster and Sofia Kovalevskaya.

He contributed greatly to the field of spectroscopy by formalizing three laws that describe the spectral composition of light emitted by incandescent objects, building substantially on the discoveries of David Alter and Anders Jonas Ångström. In 1862, he was awarded the Rumford Medal for his researches on the fixed lines of the solar spectrum, and on the inversion of the bright lines in the spectra of artificial light. In 1875 Kirchhoff accepted the first chair dedicated specifically to theoretical physics at Berlin.

He also contributed to optics, carefully solving the wave equation to provide a solid foundation for Huygens&#x27; principle (and correct it in the process).

In 1864, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

In 1884, he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Kirchhoff died in 1887, and was buried in the St Matthäus Kirchhof Cemetery in Schöneberg, Berlin (just a few meters from the graves of the Brothers Grimm). Leopold Kronecker is buried in the same cemetery.

===Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws===

Kirchhoff&#x27;s first law is that the algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point (or node) is zero. The second law is that in a closed circuit, the directed sums of the voltages in the system is zero.

=== Kirchhoff&#x27;s three laws of spectroscopy ===
#A solid, liquid, or dense gas excited to emit light will radiate at all wavelengths and thus produce a continuous spectrum.
#A low-density gas excited to emit light will do so at specific wavelengths, and this produces an emission spectrum. 
# If light composing a continuous spectrum passes through a cool, low-density gas, the result will be an absorption spectrum.

Kirchhoff did not know about the existence of energy levels in atoms. The existence of discrete spectral lines had been known since Fraunhofer discovered them in 1814. That the lines formed a discrete mathematical pattern was described by Johann Balmer in 1885. Joseph Larmor explained the splitting of the spectral lines in a magnetic field known as the Zeeman Effect by the oscillation of electrons. These discrete spectral lines were not explained as electron transitions until the Bohr model of the atom in 1913, which helped lead to quantum mechanics.

=== Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation ===
It was Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation in which he proposed an unknown universal law for radiation that led Max Planck to the discovery of the quantum of action leading to quantum mechanics.

=== Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermochemistry ===

Kirchhoff showed in 1858 that, in thermochemistry, the variation of the heat of a chemical reaction is given by the difference in heat capacity between products and reactants:

:formula_1.

Integration of this equation permits the evaluation of the heat of reaction at one temperature from measurements at another temperature.

===Kirchhoff&#x27;s theorem in graph theory===
Kirchhoff also worked in the mathematical field of graph theory, in which he proved Kirchhoff&#x27;s matrix tree theorem.

<doc id="12333" wikidata="Q183167" url="?curid=12333" title="G. K. Chesterton">
<text>Gilbert Keith Chesterton (29 May 1874 – 14 June 1936) was an English author, philosopher, Christian apologist, and literary and art critic.

Chesterton created the fictional priest-detective Father Brown, and wrote on apologetics, such as his works &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; and &quot;The Everlasting Man&quot;. Chesterton routinely referred to himself as an orthodox Christian, and came to identify this position more and more with Catholicism, eventually converting from high church Anglicanism. Biographers have identified him as a successor to such Victorian authors as Matthew Arnold, Thomas Carlyle, John Henry Newman and John Ruskin.

He has been referred to as the &quot;prince of paradox&quot;. Of his writing style, &quot;Time&quot; observed: &quot;Whenever possible, Chesterton made his points with popular sayings, proverbs, allegories—first carefully turning them inside out.&quot; His writings were an influence on Jorge Luis Borges, who compared his work with that of Edgar Allan Poe.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===

Chesterton was born in Campden Hill in Kensington, London, on 29 May 1874. His father was Edward Chesterton, an estate agent, and his mother was Marie Louise, Grosjean, of Swiss-French origin. Chesterton was baptised at the age of one month into the Church of England, though his family themselves were irregularly practising Unitarians. According to his autobiography, as a young man he became fascinated with the occult and, along with his brother Cecil, experimented with Ouija boards. He was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, then attended the Slade School of Art to become an illustrator. The Slade is a department of University College London, where Chesterton also took classes in literature, but he did not complete a degree in either subject. He married Frances Blogg in 1901; the marriage lasted the rest of his life. Chesterton credited Frances with leading him back to Anglicanism, though he later considered Anglicanism to be a &quot;pale imitation&quot;. He entered in full communion with the Catholic Church in 1922. The couple were unable to have children.

A friend from schooldays was Edmund Clerihew Bentley, inventor of the clerihew, a whimsical four-line biographical poem. Chesterton himself wrote clerihews and illustrated his friend&#x27;s first published collection of poetry, &quot;Biography for Beginners&quot; (1905), which popularised the clerihew form. He became godfather to Bentley&#x27;s son, Nicolas, and opened his novel &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot; with a poem written to Bentley.

===Career===
In September 1895, Chesterton began working for the London publisher George Redway, where he remained for just over a year. In October 1896, he moved to the publishing house T. Fisher Unwin, where he remained until 1902. During this period he also undertook his first journalistic work, as a freelance art and literary critic. In 1902, &quot;The Daily News&quot; gave him a weekly opinion column, followed in 1905 by a weekly column in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, for which he continued to write for the next thirty years.

Early on Chesterton showed a great interest in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his writing shows a vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images. Father Brown is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks at the scene of the crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition, repentance and reconciliation. For example, in the story &quot;The Flying Stars&quot;, Father Brown entreats the character Flambeau to give up his life of crime: &quot;There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don&#x27;t fancy they will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man has ever been able to keep on one level of evil. That road goes down and down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills and lies about it. Many a man I&#x27;ve known started like you to be an honest outlaw, a merry robber of the rich, and ended stamped into slime.&quot;

Chesterton loved to debate, often engaging in friendly public disputes with such men as George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Bertrand Russell and Clarence Darrow. According to his autobiography, he and Shaw played cowboys in a silent film that was never released. On 7 January 1914 Chesterton (along with his brother Cecil and future sister-in-law Ada) took part in the mock-trial of John Jasper for the murder of Edwin Drood. Chesterton was Judge and George Bernard Shaw played the role of foreman of the jury.

Chesterton was a large man, standing tall and weighing around . His girth gave rise to an anecdote during the First World War, when a lady in London asked why he was not &quot;out at the Front&quot;; he replied, &quot;If you go round to the side, you will see that I am.&quot; On another occasion he remarked to his friend George Bernard Shaw, &quot;To look at you, anyone would think a famine had struck England.&quot; Shaw retorted, &quot;To look at you, anyone would think you had caused it.&quot; P. G. Wodehouse once described a very loud crash as &quot;a sound like G. K. Chesterton falling onto a sheet of tin&quot;. Chesterton usually wore a cape and a crumpled hat, with a swordstick in hand, and a cigar hanging out of his mouth. He had a tendency to forget where he was supposed to be going and miss the train that was supposed to take him there. It is reported that on several occasions he sent a telegram to his wife Frances from an incorrect location, writing such things as &quot;Am in Market Harborough. Where ought I to be?&quot; to which she would reply, &quot;Home&quot;. Chesterton himself told this story, omitting, however, his wife&#x27;s alleged reply, in his autobiography.

In 1931, the BBC invited Chesterton to give a series of radio talks. He accepted, tentatively at first. He was allowed (and encouraged) to improvise on the scripts. This allowed his talks to maintain an intimate character, as did the decision to allow his wife and secretary to sit with him during his broadcasts. The talks were very popular. A BBC official remarked, after Chesterton&#x27;s death, that &quot;in another year or so, he would have become the dominating voice from Broadcasting House.&quot; Chesterton was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1935.

Chesterton was part of the Detection Club, a society of British mystery authors founded by Anthony Berkeley in 1928. He was elected as the first president and served from 1930 to 1936 until he was succeeded by E. C. Bentley.

Chesterton was one of the dominating figures of the London literary scene in the early 20th century.

=== Death ===
Chesterton died of congestive heart failure on 14 June 1936, aged 62, at his home in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. His last words were a greeting of good morning spoken to his wife Frances. The sermon at Chesterton&#x27;s Requiem Mass in Westminster Cathedral, London, was delivered by Ronald Knox on 27 June 1936. Knox said, &quot;All of this generation has grown up under Chesterton&#x27;s influence so completely that we do not even know when we are thinking Chesterton.&quot; He is buried in Beaconsfield in the Catholic Cemetery. Chesterton&#x27;s estate was probated at £28,389, .

Near the end of Chesterton&#x27;s life, Pope Pius XI invested him as Knight Commander with Star of the Papal Order of St. Gregory the Great (KC*SG). The Chesterton Society has proposed that he be beatified.

==Writing==
Chesterton wrote around 80 books, several hundred poems, some 200 short stories, 4,000 essays (mostly newspaper columns), and several plays. He was a literary and social critic, historian, playwright, novelist, and Catholic theologian and apologist, debater, and mystery writer. He was a columnist for the &quot;Daily News&quot;, &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, and his own paper, &quot;G. K.&#x27;s Weekly&quot;; he also wrote articles for the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, including the entry on Charles Dickens and part of the entry on Humour in the 14th edition (1929). His best-known character is the priest-detective Father Brown, who appeared only in short stories, while &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot; is arguably his best-known novel. He was a convinced Christian long before he was received into the Catholic Church, and Christian themes and symbolism appear in much of his writing. In the United States, his writings on distributism were popularised through &quot;The American Review&quot;, published by Seward Collins in New York.

Of his nonfiction, &quot;Charles Dickens: A Critical Study&quot; (1906) has received some of the broadest-based praise. According to Ian Ker (&quot;The Catholic Revival in English Literature, 1845–1961&quot;, 2003), &quot;In Chesterton&#x27;s eyes Dickens belongs to Merry, not Puritan, England&quot;; Ker treats Chesterton&#x27;s thought in chapter 4 of that book as largely growing out of his true appreciation of Dickens, a somewhat shop-soiled property in the view of other literary opinions of the time. The biography was largely responsible for creating a popular revival for Dickens&#x27;s work as well as a serious reconsideration of Dickens by scholars.

Chesterton&#x27;s writings consistently displayed wit and a sense of humour. He employed paradox, while making serious comments on the world, government, politics, economics, philosophy, theology and many other topics.

T. S. Eliot summed up his work as follows:

Eliot commented further that &quot;His poetry was first-rate journalistic balladry, and I do not suppose that he took it more seriously than it deserved. He reached a high imaginative level with &quot;The Napoleon of Notting Hill&quot;, and higher with &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot;, romances in which he turned the Stevensonian fantasy to more serious purpose. His book on Dickens seems to me the best essay on that author that has ever been written. Some of his essays can be read again and again; though of his essay-writing as a whole, one can only say that it is remarkable to have maintained such a high average with so large an output.&quot;

In 2022, a three-volume bibliography of Chesterton was published, listing 9,000 contributions he made to newspapers, magazines, and journals, as well as 200 books and 3,000 articles about him.

==Contemporaries==

===&quot;Chesterbelloc&quot;===


Chesterton is often associated with his close friend, the poet and essayist Hilaire Belloc. George Bernard Shaw coined the name &quot;Chesterbelloc&quot; for their partnership, and this stuck. Though they were very different men, they shared many beliefs; in 1922, Chesterton joined Belloc in the Catholic faith, and both voiced criticisms of capitalism and socialism. They instead espoused a third way: distributism. &quot;G. K.&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, which occupied much of Chesterton&#x27;s energy in the last 15 years of his life, was the successor to Belloc&#x27;s &quot;New Witness&quot;, taken over from Cecil Chesterton, Gilbert&#x27;s brother, who died in World War I.

In his book &quot;On the Place of Gilbert Chesterton in English Letters&quot;, Belloc wrote that &quot;Everything he wrote upon any one of the great English literary names was of the first quality. He summed up any one pen (that of Jane Austen, for instance) in exact sentences; sometimes in a single sentence, after a fashion which no one else has approached. He stood quite by himself in this department. He understood the very minds (to take the two most famous names) of Thackeray and of Dickens. He understood and presented Meredith. He understood the supremacy in Milton. He understood Pope. He understood the great Dryden. He was not swamped as nearly all his contemporaries were by Shakespeare, wherein they drown as in a vast sea – for that is what Shakespeare is. Gilbert Chesterton continued to understand the youngest and latest comers as he understood the forefathers in our great corpus of English verse and prose.&quot;

=== Wilde===
In his book &quot;Heretics&quot;, Chesterton said this of Oscar Wilde: &quot;The same lesson [of the pessimistic pleasure-seeker] was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar Wilde. It is the carpe diem religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw.&quot; More briefly, and with a closer approximation to Wilde&#x27;s own style, he wrote in his 1908 book &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; concerning the necessity of making symbolic sacrifices for the gift of creation: &quot;Oscar Wilde said that sunsets were not valued because we could not pay for sunsets. But Oscar Wilde was wrong; we can pay for sunsets. We can pay for them by not being Oscar Wilde.&quot;

===Shaw===
Chesterton and George Bernard Shaw were famous friends and enjoyed their arguments and discussions. Although rarely in agreement, they each maintained good will toward, and respect for, the other. In his writing, Chesterton expressed himself very plainly on where they differed and why. In &quot;Heretics&quot; he writes of Shaw:

==Views==
=== Advocacy of Catholicism ===

Chesterton&#x27;s views, in contrast to Shaw and others, became increasingly focused towards the Church. In &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; he wrote: &quot;The worship of will is the negation of will... If Mr Bernard Shaw comes up to me and says, &#x27;Will something&#x27;, that is tantamount to saying, &#x27;I do not mind what you will&#x27;, and that is tantamount to saying, &#x27;I have no will in the matter.&#x27; You cannot admire will in general, because the essence of will is that it is particular.&quot;

Chesterton&#x27;s &quot;The Everlasting Man&quot; contributed to C. S. Lewis&#x27;s conversion to Christianity. In a letter to Sheldon Vanauken (14 December 1950), Lewis called the book &quot;the best popular apologetic I know&quot;, and to Rhonda Bodle he wrote (31 December 1947) &quot;the [very] best popular defence of the full Christian position I know is G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s &quot;The Everlasting Man&quot;&quot;. The book was also cited in a list of 10 books that &quot;most shaped his vocational attitude and philosophy of life&quot;.

Chesterton&#x27;s hymn &quot;O God of Earth and Altar&quot; was printed in &quot;The Commonwealth&quot; and then included in &quot;The English Hymnal&quot; in 1906. Several lines of the hymn appear in the beginning of the song &quot;Revelations&quot; by the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden on their 1983 album &quot;Piece of Mind&quot;. Lead singer Bruce Dickinson in an interview stated &quot;I have a fondness for hymns. I love some of the ritual, the beautiful words, &quot;Jerusalem&quot; and there was another one, with words by G. K. Chesterton &quot;O God of Earth and Altar&quot; – very fire and brimstone: &#x27;Bow down and hear our cry&#x27;. I used that for an Iron Maiden song, &quot;Revelations&quot;. In my strange and clumsy way I was trying to say look it&#x27;s all the same stuff.&quot;

Étienne Gilson praised Chesterton&#x27;s book on Thomas Aquinas: &quot;I consider it as being, without possible comparison, the best book ever written on Saint Thomas... the few readers who have spent twenty or thirty years in studying St. Thomas Aquinas, and who, perhaps, have themselves published two or three volumes on the subject, cannot fail to perceive that the so-called &#x27;wit&#x27; of Chesterton has put their scholarship to shame.&quot;

Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, the author of 70 books, identified Chesterton as the stylist who had the greatest impact on his own writing, stating in his autobiography &quot;Treasure in Clay&quot;, &quot;the greatest influence in writing was G. K. Chesterton who never used a useless word, who saw the value of a paradox, and avoided what was trite.&quot; Chesterton wrote the introduction to Sheen&#x27;s book &quot;God and Intelligence in Modern Philosophy; A Critical Study in the Light of the Philosophy of Saint Thomas&quot;.

===Common Sense===

Chesterton has been called &quot;The Apostle of Common Sense&quot;. He was critical of the thinkers and popular philosophers of the day, who though very clever, were saying things that he considered nonsensical. This is illustrated again in &quot;Orthodoxy&quot;: &quot;Thus when Mr H. G. Wells says (as he did somewhere), &#x27;All chairs are quite different&#x27;, he utters not merely a misstatement, but a contradiction in terms. If all chairs were quite different, you could not call them &#x27;all chairs&#x27;.&quot;

Chesterton was an early member of the Fabian Society but resigned at the time of the Boer War. He is often identified as a traditionalist conservative due to his staunch support of tradition, expressed in &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; and other works with Burkean quotes such as the following:
Chesterton also called himself &quot;the last liberal&quot;.

===On War===
Chesterton first emerged as a journalist just after the turn of the 20th century. His great, and very lonely, opposition to the Second Boer War, set him very much apart from most of the rest of the British press. Chesterton was a Little Englander, opposed to imperialism, British or otherwise. Chesterton thought that Great Britain betrayed her own principles in the Boer Wars. 

In vivid contrast to his opposition to the Boer Wars, Chesterton vigorously defended and encouraged the Allies in World War I. &quot;The war was in Chesterton&#x27;s eyes a crusade, and he was certain that England was right to fight as she had been wrong in fighting the Boers.&quot; Chesterton saw the roots of the war in Prussian militarism. He was deeply disturbed by Prussia&#x27;s unprovoked invasion and occupation of neutral Belgium and by reports of shocking atrocities the Imperial German Army was allegedly committing in Belgium. Over the course of the War, Chesterton wrote hundreds of essays defending it, attacking pacifism, and exhorting the public to persevere until victory. Some of these essays were collected in the 1916 work, &quot;The Barbarism of Berlin&quot;.

One of Chesterton&#x27;s most successful works in support of the War was his 1915 tongue-in-cheek &quot;The Crimes of England&quot;. The work is ironic, supposedly apologizing and trying to help a fictitious Prussian professor named Whirlwind make the case for Prussia in WWI, while actually attacking Prussia throughout. Part of the book&#x27;s humorous impact is the conceit that Professor Whirlwind never realizes how his supposed benefactor is undermining Prussia at every turn. Chesterton &quot;blames&quot; England for historically building up Prussia against Austria, and for its pacifism, especially among wealthy British Quaker political donors, who prevented Britain from standing up to past Prussian aggression.

===Accusations of antisemitism===

Chesterton faced accusations of antisemitism during his lifetime, saying in his 1920 book &quot;The New Jerusalem&quot; that it was something &quot;for which my friends and I were for a long period rebuked and even reviled&quot;. Despite his protestations to the contrary, the accusation continues to be repeated. An early supporter of Captain Dreyfus, by 1906 he had turned into an anti-Dreyfusard. From the early 20th century, his fictional work included caricatures of Jews, stereotyping them as greedy, cowardly, disloyal and communists. Martin Gardner suggests that &quot;Four Faultless Felons&quot; was allowed to go out of print in the United States because of the &quot;anti-Semitism which mars so many pages.&quot;

The Marconi scandal of 1912–1913 brought issues of anti-Semitism into the political mainstream. Senior ministers in the Liberal government had secretly profited from advance knowledge of deals regarding wireless telegraphy, and critics regarded it as relevant that some of the key players were Jewish. According to historian Todd Endelman, who identified Chesterton as among the most vocal critics, &quot;The Jew-baiting at the time of the Boer War and the Marconi scandal was linked to a broader protest, mounted in the main by the Radical wing of the Liberal Party, against the growing visibility of successful businessmen in national life and their challenge to what were seen as traditional English values.&quot;

In a work of 1917, titled &quot;A Short History of England&quot;, Chesterton considers the royal decree of 1290 by which Edward I expelled Jews from England, a policy that remained in place until 1655. Chesterton writes that popular perception of Jewish moneylenders could well have led Edward I&#x27;s subjects to regard him as a &quot;tender father of his people&quot; for &quot;breaking the rule by which the rulers had hitherto fostered their bankers&#x27; wealth&quot;. He felt that Jews, &quot;a sensitive and highly civilized people&quot; who &quot;were the capitalists of the age, the men with wealth banked ready for use&quot;, might legitimately complain that &quot;Christian kings and nobles, and even Christian popes and bishops, used for Christian purposes (such as the Crusades and the cathedrals) the money that could only be accumulated in such mountains by a usury they inconsistently denounced as unchristian; and then, when worse times came, gave up the Jew to the fury of the poor&quot;.

In &quot;The New Jerusalem,&quot; Chesterton dedicated a chapter to his views on the Jewish question: the sense that Jews were a distinct people without a homeland of their own, living as foreigners in countries where they were always a minority. He wrote that in the past, his position:

In the same place he proposed the thought experiment (describing it as &quot;a parable&quot; and &quot;a flippant fancy&quot;) that Jews should be admitted to any role in English public life on condition that they must wear distinctively Middle Eastern garb, explaining that &quot;The point is that we should know where we are; and he would know where he is, which is in a foreign land.&quot;

Chesterton, like Belloc, openly expressed his abhorrence of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rule almost as soon as it started. As Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise wrote in a posthumous tribute to Chesterton in 1937:

In &quot;The Truth About the Tribes,&quot; Chesterton attacked Nazi racial theories, writing: &quot;the essence of Nazi Nationalism is to preserve the purity of a race in a continent where all races are impure&quot;.

The historian Simon Mayers points out that Chesterton wrote in works such as &quot;The Crank&quot;, &quot;The Heresy of Race&quot;, and &quot;The Barbarian as Bore&quot; against the concept of racial superiority and critiqued pseudo-scientific race theories, saying they were akin to a new religion. In &quot;The Truth About the Tribes&quot; Chesterton wrote, &quot;the curse of race religion is that it makes each separate man the sacred image which he worships. His own bones are the sacred relics; his own blood is the blood of St. Januarius&quot;. Mayers records that despite &quot;his hostility towards Nazi antisemitism … [it is unfortunate that he made] claims that &#x27;Hitlerism&#x27; was a form of Judaism, and that the Jews were partly responsible for race theory&quot;. In &quot;The Judaism of Hitler&quot;, as well as in &quot;A Queer Choice&quot; and &quot;The Crank&quot;, Chesterton made much of the fact that the very notion of &quot;a Chosen Race&quot; was of Jewish origin, saying in &quot;The Crank&quot;: &quot;If there is one outstanding quality in Hitlerism it is its Hebraism&quot; and &quot;the new Nordic Man has all the worst faults of the worst Jews: jealousy, greed, the mania of conspiracy, and above all, the belief in a Chosen Race&quot;.

Mayers also shows that Chesterton portrayed Jews not only as culturally and religiously distinct, but racially as well. In &quot;The Feud of the Foreigner&quot; (1920) he said that the Jew &quot;is a foreigner far more remote from us than is a Bavarian from a Frenchman; he is divided by the same type of division as that between us and a Chinaman or a Hindoo. He not only is not, but never was, of the same race&quot;.

In &quot;The Everlasting Man&quot;, while writing about human sacrifice, Chesterton suggested that medieval stories about Jews killing children might have resulted from a distortion of genuine cases of devil worship. Chesterton wrote:

The American Chesterton Society has devoted a whole issue of its magazine, &quot;Gilbert&quot;, to defending Chesterton against charges of antisemitism. Likewise, Ann Farmer, author of &quot;Chesterton and the Jews: Friend, Critic, Defender&quot;, writes, &quot;Public figures from Winston Churchill to Wells proposed remedies for the &#x27;Jewish problem&#x27; – the seemingly endless cycle of anti-Jewish persecution – all shaped by their worldviews. As patriots, Churchill and Chesterton embraced Zionism; both were among the first to defend the Jews from Nazism&quot;, concluding that &quot;A defender of Jews in his youth – a conciliator as well as a defender – GKC returned to the defence when the Jewish people needed it most.&quot;

===Opposition to eugenics===

In &quot;Eugenics and Other Evils&quot;, Chesterton attacked eugenics as Parliament was moving towards passage of the Mental Deficiency Act 1913. Some backing the ideas of eugenics called for the government to sterilise people deemed &quot;mentally defective&quot;; this view did not gain popularity but the idea of segregating them from the rest of society and thereby preventing them from reproducing did gain traction. These ideas disgusted Chesterton who wrote, &quot;It is not only openly said, it is eagerly urged that the aim of the measure is to prevent any person whom these propagandists do not happen to think intelligent from having any wife or children.&quot; He condemned the proposed wording for such measures as being so vague as to apply to anyone, including &quot;Every tramp who is sulk, every labourer who is shy, every rustic who is eccentric, can quite easily be brought under such conditions as were designed for homicidal maniacs. That is the situation; and that is the point... we are already under the Eugenist State; and nothing remains to us but rebellion.&quot; He derided such ideas as founded on nonsense, &quot;as if one had a right to dragoon and enslave one&#x27;s fellow citizens as a kind of chemical experiment&quot;. Chesterton mocked the idea that poverty was a result of bad breeding: &quot;[it is a] strange new disposition to regard the poor as a race; as if they were a colony of Japs or Chinese coolies... The poor are not a race or even a type. It is senseless to talk about breeding them; for they are not a breed. They are, in cold fact, what Dickens describes: &#x27;a dustbin of individual accidents,&#x27; of damaged dignity, and often of damaged gentility.&quot;

===Chesterton&#x27;s fence===
&quot;Chesterton&#x27;s fence&quot; is the principle that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood. The quotation is from Chesterton&#x27;s 1929 book, &quot;The Thing: Why I Am a Catholic&quot;, in the chapter, &quot;The Drift from Domesticity&quot;:

===Distributism===
Inspired by Leo XIII&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;, Chesterton&#x27;s brother Cecil and his friend, Hilaire Belloc were instrumental in developing the economic philosophy of distributism, a word Belloc coined. Gilbert embraced their views and, particularly after Cecil&#x27;s death in World War I, became one of the foremost distributists and the newspaper whose care he inherited from Cecil, which ultimately came to be named &quot;G. K.&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, became its most consistent advocate. Distributism stands as a third way, against both unrestrained capitalism, and socialism, advocating a wide distribution of both property and political power.

=== Scottish and Irish nationalism ===

Despite his opposition to Nazism, Chesterton was not an opponent of nationalism in general and gave a degree of support to Scottish and Irish nationalism. He endorsed Cunninghame Graham and Compton Mackenzie for the post of Lord Rector of Glasgow University in 1928 and 1931 respectively and praised Scottish Catholics as &quot;patriots&quot; in contrast to Anglophile Protestants such as John Knox. Chesterton was also a supporter of the Irish Home Rule movement and maintained friendships with members of the Irish Parliamentary Party. This was in part due to his belief that Irish Catholics had a naturally distributist outlook on property ownership.

==Legacy==

James Parker, in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, gave a modern appraisal:

===Possible sainthood===
The Bishop Emeritus of Northampton, Peter Doyle, in 2012 had opened a preliminary investigation into possibly launching a cause for beatification and then canonization (for possible sainthood). but eventually decided not to open the cause. The current Bishop of Northampton, David Oakley, has agreed to preach at a Mass during a Chesterton pilgrimage in England (the route goes through London and Beaconsfield, which are both connected to his life), and some have speculated he may be more favourable to the idea. If the cause is actually opened at the diocesan level (the Vatican must also give approval, that nothing stands in the way – the &quot;nihil obstat&quot;), then he could be given the title &quot;Servant of God&quot;. It is not known if his alleged anti-Semitism (which would be considered a serious matter by the Church if it is true) may have played a role. His life and writings and views and what he did for others would be closely examined, in any case.

===Literary===
Chesterton&#x27;s socio-economic system of Distributism affected the sculptor Eric Gill, who established a commune of Catholic artists at Ditchling in Sussex. The Ditchling group developed a journal called &quot;The Game&quot;, in which they expressed many Chestertonian principles, particularly anti-industrialism and an advocacy of religious family life. His novel &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot; inspired the Irish Republican leader Michael Collins with the idea that &quot;If you didn&#x27;t seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out.&quot; Collins&#x27;s favourite work of Chesterton was &quot;The Napoleon of Notting Hill&quot;, and he was &quot;almost fanatically attached to it&quot;, according to his friend Sir William Darling. His in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; on 18 September 1909 had a profound effect on Mahatma Gandhi. P. N. Furbank asserts that Gandhi was &quot;thunderstruck&quot; when he read it, while Martin Green notes that &quot;Gandhi was so delighted with this that he told &quot;Indian Opinion&quot; to reprint it&quot;. Another convert was Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan, who said that the book &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong with the World&quot; (1910) changed his life in terms of ideas and religion. The author Neil Gaiman stated that he grew up reading Chesterton in his school&#x27;s library, and that &quot;The Napoleon of Notting Hill&quot; influenced his own book &quot;Neverwhere&quot;. Gaiman based the character Gilbert from the comic book &quot;The Sandman&quot; on Chesterton, and &quot;Good Omens&quot;, the novel Gaiman co-wrote with Terry Pratchett, is dedicated to Chesterton. The Argentine author and essayist Jorge Luis Borges cited Chesterton as influential on his fiction, telling interviewer Richard Burgin that &quot;Chesterton knew how to make the most of a detective story&quot;.

===Education===
Chesterton&#x27;s many references to education and human formation have inspired a variety of educators including the 69 schools of the Chesterton Schools Network, which includes the Chesterton Academy founded by Dale Ahlquist. and the Italian Scuola Libera G. K. Chesterton in San Benedetto del Tronto, Marche. The publisher and educator Christopher Perrin (who completed his doctoral work on Chesterton) makes frequent reference to Chesterton in his work with classical schools.

=== Namesakes ===
In 1974, Ian Boyd, founded &quot;The Chesterton Review&quot;, a scholarly journal devoted to Chesterton and his circle. The journal is published by the G. K. Chesterton Institute for Faith and Culture based in Seton Hall University, South Orange, New Jersey.

In 1996, Dale Ahlquist founded the American Chesterton Society to explore and promote Chesterton&#x27;s writings.

In 2008, a Catholic high school, Chesterton Academy, opened in the Minneapolis area. In the same year Scuola Libera Chesterton opened in San Benedetto del Tronto, Italy.

In 2012, a crater on the planet Mercury was named Chesterton after the author.

In 2014, G. K. Chesterton Academy of Chicago, a Catholic high school, opened in Highland Park, Illinois.

A fictionalised G. K. Chesterton is the central character in the &quot;Young Chesterton Chronicles&quot;, a series of young adult adventure novels by John McNichol, and in the &quot;G K Chesterton Mystery series&quot;, a series of detective novels by the Australian author Kel Richards.

Another fictional character named Gil Chesterton is a food and wine critic who works for KACL, the Seattle radio station featured in the American television series &quot;Frasier&quot;.
