<text>Galaxy groups and clusters are the largest known gravitationally bound objects to have arisen thus far in the process of cosmic structure formation. They form the densest part of the large-scale structure of the Universe. In models for the gravitational formation of structure with cold dark matter, the smallest structures collapse first and eventually build the largest structures, clusters of galaxies. Clusters are then formed relatively recently between 10 billion years ago and now. Groups and clusters may contain ten to thousands of individual galaxies. The clusters themselves are often associated with larger, non-gravitationally bound, groups called superclusters.

== Groups of galaxies ==

Groups of galaxies are the smallest aggregates of galaxies. They typically contain no more than 50 galaxies in a diameter of 1 to 2 megaparsecs (Mpc)(see 1022 m for distance comparisons). Their mass is approximately 1013 solar masses. The spread of velocities for the individual galaxies is about 150 km/s. However, this definition should be used as a guide only, as larger and more massive galaxy systems are sometimes classified as galaxy groups. Groups are the most common structures of galaxies in the universe, comprising at least 50% of the galaxies in the local universe. Groups have a mass range between those of the very large elliptical galaxies and clusters of galaxies.

Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is contained in the Local Group of more than 54 galaxies.

In July 2017 S. Paul, R. S. John et al. defined clear distinguishing parameters for classifying galaxy aggregations as ‘galaxy groups’ and ‘clusters’ on the basis of scaling laws that they followed. According to this paper, galaxy aggregations less massive than 8 × 1013 solar masses are classified as galaxy groups.

== Clusters of galaxies ==

Clusters are larger than groups, although there is no sharp dividing line between the two. When observed visually, clusters appear to be collections of galaxies held together by mutual gravitational attraction. However, their velocities are too large for them to remain gravitationally bound by their mutual attractions, implying the presence of either an additional invisible mass component, or an additional attractive force besides gravity. X-ray studies have revealed the presence of large amounts of intergalactic gas known as the intracluster medium. This gas is very hot, between 107K and 108K, and hence emits X-rays in the form of bremsstrahlung and atomic line emission.

The total mass of the gas is greater than that of the galaxies by roughly a factor of two. However, this is still not enough mass to keep the galaxies in the cluster. Since this gas is in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium with the overall cluster gravitational field, the total mass distribution can be determined. It turns out the total mass deduced from this measurement is approximately six times larger than the mass of the galaxies or the hot gas. The missing component is known as dark matter and its nature is unknown. In a typical cluster perhaps only 5% of the total mass is in the form of galaxies, maybe 10% in the form of hot X-ray emitting gas and the remainder is dark matter. Brownstein and Moffat use a theory of modified gravity to explain X-ray cluster masses without dark matter. Observations of the Bullet Cluster are the strongest evidence for the existence of dark matter; however, Brownstein and Moffat have shown that their modified gravity theory can also account for the properties of the cluster.

== Observational methods ==
Clusters of galaxies have been found in surveys by a number of observational techniques and have been studied in detail using many methods:
* Optical or infrared: The individual galaxies of clusters can be studied through optical or infrared imaging and spectroscopy. Galaxy clusters are found by optical or infrared telescopes by searching for overdensities, and then confirmed by finding several galaxies at a similar redshift. Infrared searches are more useful for finding more distant (higher redshift) clusters.
* X-ray: The hot plasma emits X-rays that can be detected by X-ray telescopes. The cluster gas can be studied using both X-ray imaging and X-ray spectroscopy. Clusters are quite prominent in X-ray surveys and along with AGN are the brightest X-ray emitting extragalactic objects.
* Radio: A number of diffuse structures emitting at radio frequencies have been found in clusters. Groups of radio sources (that may include diffuse structures or AGN) have been used as tracers of cluster location. At high redshift imaging around individual radio sources (in this case AGN) has been used to detect proto-clusters (clusters in the process of forming).
* Sunyaev-Zel&#x27;dovich effect: The hot electrons in the intracluster medium scatter radiation from the cosmic microwave background through inverse Compton scattering. This produces a &quot;shadow&quot; in the observed cosmic microwave background at some radio frequencies.
* Gravitational lensing: Clusters of galaxies contain enough matter to distort the observed orientations of galaxies behind them. The observed distortions can be used to model the distribution of dark matter in the cluster.

== Temperature and density ==
Clusters of galaxies are the most recent and most massive objects to have arisen in the hierarchical structure formation of the Universe and the study of clusters tells one about the way galaxies form and evolve. Clusters have two important properties: their masses are large enough to retain any energetic gas ejected from member galaxies and the thermal energy of the gas within the cluster is observable within the X-Ray bandpass. The observed state of gas within a cluster is determined by a combination of shock heating during accretion, radiative cooling, and thermal feedback triggered by that cooling. The density, temperature, and substructure of the intracluster X-Ray gas therefore represents the entire thermal history of cluster formation. To better understand this thermal history one needs to study the entropy of the gas because entropy is the quantity most directly changed by increasing or decreasing the thermal energy of intracluster gas.

<text>Grus (, or colloquially ) is a constellation in the southern sky. Its name is Latin for the crane, a type of bird. It is one of twelve constellations conceived by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. Grus first appeared on a celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and was depicted in Johann Bayer&#x27;s star atlas &quot;Uranometria&quot; of 1603. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille gave Bayer designations to its stars in 1756, some of which had been previously considered part of the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus. The constellations Grus, Pavo, Phoenix and Tucana are collectively known as the &quot;Southern Birds&quot;.

The constellation&#x27;s brightest star, Alpha Gruis, is also known as Alnair and appears as a 1.7-magnitude blue-white star. Beta Gruis is a red giant variable star with a minimum magnitude of 2.3 and a maximum magnitude of 2.0. Six star systems have been found to have planets: the red dwarf Gliese 832 is one of the closest stars to Earth to have a planetary system. Another—WASP-95—has a planet that orbits every two days. Deep-sky objects found in Grus include the planetary nebula IC 5148, also known as the Spare Tyre Nebula, and a group of four interacting galaxies known as the Grus Quartet.

==History==

The stars that form Grus were originally considered part of the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus (the southern fish), with Gamma Gruis seen as part of the fish&#x27;s tail. The stars were first defined as a separate constellation by the astronomer Petrus Plancius, who created twelve new constellations based on the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the &quot;Eerste Schipvaart&quot;, to the East Indies. Grus first appeared on a 35-centimetre-diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. Its first depiction in a celestial atlas was in the German cartographer Johann Bayer&#x27;s &quot;Uranometria&quot; of 1603. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name &quot;Den Reygher&quot;, &quot;The Heron&quot;, but Bayer followed Plancius and Hondius in using Grus.

An alternative name for the constellation, &quot;Phoenicopterus&quot; (Latin &quot;flamingo&quot;), was used briefly during the early 17th century, seen in the 1605 work &quot;Cosmographiae Generalis&quot; by Paul Merula of Leiden University and a c. 1625 globe by Dutch globe maker Pieter van den Keere. Astronomer Ian Ridpath has reported the symbolism likely came from Plancius originally, who had worked with both of these people. Grus and the nearby constellations Phoenix, Tucana and Pavo are collectively called the &quot;Southern Birds&quot;.

The stars that correspond to Grus were generally too far south to be seen from China. In Chinese astronomy, Gamma and Lambda Gruis may have been included in the tub-shaped asterism &quot;Bàijiù&quot;, along with stars from Piscis Austrinus. In Central Australia, the Arrernte and Luritja people living on a mission in Hermannsburg viewed the sky as divided between them, east of the Milky Way representing Arrernte camps and west denoting Luritja camps. Alpha and Beta Gruis, along with Fomalhaut, Alpha Pavonis and the stars of Musca, were all claimed by the Arrernte.

==Characteristics==
Grus is bordered by Piscis Austrinus to the north, Sculptor to the northeast, Phoenix to the east, Tucana to the south, Indus to the southwest, and Microscopium to the west. Bayer straightened the tail of Piscis Austrinus to make way for Grus in his &quot;Uranometria&quot;. Covering 366 square degrees, it ranks 45th of the 88 modern constellations in size and covers 0.887% of the night sky. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Gru&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined as a polygon of 6 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between −36.31° and −56.39°. Grus is located too far south to be seen by observers in the British Isles and the northern United States, though it can easily be seen from Florida or San Diego; the whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 33°N.

==Features==

===Stars===
Keyser and de Houtman assigned twelve stars to the constellation. Bayer depicted Grus on his chart, but did not assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Phi in 1756 with some omissions. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Gould added Kappa, Nu, Omicron and Xi, which had all been catalogued by Lacaille but not given Bayer designations. Lacaille considered them too faint, while Gould thought otherwise. Xi Gruis had originally been placed in Microscopium. Conversely, Gould dropped Lacaille&#x27;s Sigma as he thought it was too dim.

Grus has several bright stars. Marking the left wing is Alpha Gruis, a blue-white star of spectral type B6V and apparent magnitude 1.7, around 101 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name, Alnair, means &quot;the bright one&quot; and refers to its status as the brightest star in Grus (although the Arabians saw it as the brightest star in the Fish&#x27;s tail, as Grus was then depicted).Alnair Alnair is around 380 times as luminous and has over 3 times the diameter of the Sun. Lying 5 degrees west of Alnair, denoting the Crane&#x27;s heart is Beta Gruis (the proper name is Tiaki), a red giant of spectral type M5III. It has a diameter of 0.8 astronomical units (AU) (if placed in the Solar System it would extend to the orbit of Venus) located around 170 light-years from Earth. It is a variable star with a minimum magnitude of 2.3 and a maximum magnitude of 2.0. An imaginary line drawn from the Great Square of Pegasus through Fomalhaut will lead to Alnair and Beta Gruis.

Lying in the northwest corner of the constellation and marking the crane&#x27;s eye is Gamma Gruis, a blue-white subgiant of spectral type B8III and magnitude 3.0 lying around 211 light-years from Earth. Also known as Al Dhanab, it has finished fusing its core hydrogen and has begun cooling and expanding, which will see it transform into a red giant.

There are several double stars visible to the naked eye in Grus. Forming a triangle with Alnair and Beta, Delta Gruis is an optical double whose components—Delta1 and Delta2—are separated by 45 arcseconds. Delta1 is a yellow giant of spectral type G7III and magnitude 4.0, 309 light-years from Earth, and may have its own magnitude 12 orange dwarf companion. Delta2 is a red giant of spectral type M4.5III and semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 3.99 and 4.2, located 325 light-years from Earth. It has around 3 times the mass and 135 times the diameter of the Sun. Mu Gruis, composed of Mu1 and Mu2, is also an optical double—both stars are yellow giants of spectral type G8III around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun with surface temperatures of around 4900 K. Mu1 is the brighter of the two at magnitude 4.8 located around 275 light-years from Earth, while Mu2 the dimmer at magnitude 5.11 lies 265 light-years distant from Earth. Pi Gruis, an optical double with a variable component, is composed of Pi1 Gruis and Pi2. Pi1 is a semi-regular red giant of spectral type S5, ranging from magnitude 5.31 to 7.01 over a period of 191 days, and is around 532 light-years from Earth. One of the brightest S-class stars to Earth viewers, it has a companion star of apparent magnitude 10.9 with sunlike properties, being a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G0V. The pair make up a likely binary system. Pi2 is a giant star of spectral type F3III-IV located around 130 light-years from Earth, and is often brighter than its companion at magnitude 5.6. Marking the right wing is Theta Gruis, yet another double star, lying 5 degrees east of Delta1 and Delta2.

RZ Gruis is a binary system of apparent magnitude 12.3 with occasional dimming to 13.4, whose components—a white dwarf and main sequence star—are thought to orbit each other roughly every 8.5 to 10 hours. It belongs to the UX Ursae Majoris subgroup of cataclysmic variable star systems, where material from the donor star is drawn to the white dwarf where it forms an accretion disc that remains bright and outshines the two component stars. The system is poorly understood, though the donor star has been calculated to be of spectral type F5V. These stars have spectra very similar to novae that have returned to quiescence after outbursts, yet they have not been observed to have erupted themselves. The American Association of Variable Star Observers recommends watching them for future events. CE Gruis (also known as Grus V-1) is a faint (magnitude 18–21) star system also composed of a white dwarf and donor star; in this case the two are so close they are tidally locked. Known as polars, material from the donor star does not form an accretion disc around the white dwarf, but rather streams directly onto it.

Six star systems are thought to have planetary systems. Tau1 Gruis is a yellow star of magnitude 6.0 located around 106 light-years away. It may be a main sequence star or be just beginning to depart from the sequence as it expands and cools. In 2002 the star was found to have a planetary companion. HD 215456, HD 213240 and WASP-95 are yellow sunlike stars discovered to have two planets, a planet and a remote red dwarf, and a hot Jupiter, respectively; this last—WASP-95b—completes an orbit round its sun in a mere two days. Gliese 832 is a red dwarf of spectral type M1.5V and apparent magnitude 8.66 located only 16.1 light-years distant; hence it is one of the nearest stars to the Solar System. A Jupiter-like planet—Gliese 832 b—orbiting the red dwarf over a period of 9.4±0.4 years was discovered in 2008. WISE 2220−3628 is a brown dwarf of spectral type Y, and hence one of the coolest star-like objects known. It has been calculated as being around 26 light-years distant from Earth.

In July 2019, astronomers reported finding a star, S5-HVS1, traveling , faster that any other star detected so far. The star is in the Grus constellation in the southern sky, and about 29,000 light-years from Earth, and may have been propelled out of the Milky Way galaxy after interacting with Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.

===Deep-sky objects===

Nicknamed the spare-tyre nebula, IC 5148 is a planetary nebula located around 1 degree west of Lambda Gruis. Around 3000 light-years distant, it is expanding at 50 kilometres a second, one of the fastest rates of expansion of all planetary nebulae.

Northeast of Theta Gruis are four interacting galaxies known as the Grus Quartet. These galaxies are NGC 7552, NGC 7590, NGC 7599, and NGC 7582. The latter three galaxies occupy an area of sky only 10 arcminutes across and are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Grus Triplet,&quot; although all four are part of a larger loose group of galaxies called the IC 1459 Grus Group. NGC 7552 and 7582 are exhibiting high starburst activity; this is thought to have arisen because of the tidal forces from interacting. Located on the border of Grus with Piscis Austrinus, IC 1459 is a peculiar E3 giant elliptical galaxy. It has a fast counterrotating stellar core, and shells and ripples in its outer region. The galaxy has an apparent magnitude of 11.9 and is around 80 million light-years distant.

NGC 7424 is a barred spiral galaxy with an apparent magnitude of 10.4. located around 4 degrees west of the Grus Triplet. Approximately 37.5 million light-years distant, it is about 100,000 light-years in diameter, has well defined spiral arms and is thought to resemble the Milky Way. Two ultraluminous X-ray sources and one supernova have been observed in NGC 7424. SN 2001ig was discovered in 2001 and classified as a Type IIb supernova, one that initially showed a weak hydrogen line in its spectrum, but this emission later became undetectable and was replaced by lines of oxygen, magnesium and calcium, as well as other features that resembled the spectrum of a Type Ib supernova. A massive star of spectral type F, A or B is thought to be the surviving binary companion to SN 2001ig, which was believed to have been a Wolf–Rayet star.

Located near Alnair is NGC 7213, a face-on type 1 Seyfert galaxy located approximately 71.7 million light-years from Earth. It has an apparent magnitude of 12.1. Appearing undisturbed in visible light, it shows signs of having undergone a collision or merger when viewed at longer wavelengths, with disturbed patterns of ionized hydrogen including a filament of gas around 64,000 light-years long. It is part of a group of ten galaxies.

NGC 7410 is a spiral galaxy discovered by British astronomer John Herschel during observations at the Cape of Good Hope in October 1834. The galaxy has a visual magnitude of 11.7 and is approximately 122 million light-years distant from Earth.

<doc id="12576" wikidata="Q1414" url="?curid=12576" title="Galba">
<text>Galba ( ; born Servius Sulpicius Galba; 24 December 3 BC – 15 January AD 69) was Roman emperor, ruling for 7 months from 8 June AD 68 to 15 January 69. He was the first emperor in the Year of the Four Emperors and assumed the throne following Emperor Nero&#x27;s suicide.

Born into a wealthy family, Galba held at various times the positions of praetor, consul, and governor of the provinces of Gallia Aquitania, Germania Superior, and Africa during the first half of the first century AD. He retired from his positions during the latter part of Claudius&#x27; reign (with the advent of Agrippina the Younger), but Nero later granted him the governorship of Hispania. Taking advantage of the defeat of Vindex&#x27;s rebellion and Nero&#x27;s suicide, he became emperor with the support of the Praetorian Guard.

Galba&#x27;s physical weakness and general apathy led to his rule being dominated by favorites. Unable to gain popularity with the people or maintain the support of the Praetorian Guard, Galba was murdered on the orders of Otho, who became emperor in his place.

==Origins and family life==

Galba was not related to any of the emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, but he was a member of a distinguished noble family. The origin of the cognomen Galba is uncertain. Suetonius offers a number of possible explanations; the first member of the gens Sulpicia to bear the name might have gotten the name from the term &quot;galba&quot;, which the Romans used to describe the Gauls, or after an insect called &quot;galbae&quot;. One of Galba&#x27;s ancestors had been consul in 200 BC, and another of his ancestors was consul in 144 BC; the later emperor&#x27;s father and brother, both named Gaius, would hold the office in 5 BC and AD 22 respectively. 
Galba&#x27;s grandfather was a historian and his son was a barrister whose first marriage was to Mummia Achaica, granddaughter of Quintus Lutatius Catulus and great-granddaughter of Lucius Mummius Achaicus; Galba prided himself on his descent from his great-grandfather Catulus. According to Suetonius, he fabricated a genealogy of paternal descent from the god Jupiter and maternal descent from the legendary Pasiphaë, wife of Minos. Reportedly, Galba was distantly related to Livia to whom he had much respect and in turn by whom he was advanced in his career; in her will she left him fifty million sesterces; Emperor Tiberius however cheated Galba by reducing the amount to five hundred thousand sesterces and never even paid Galba the reduced amount.

Servius Sulpicius Galba was born near Terracina on 24 December 3 BC. His elder brother Gaius fled from Rome and committed suicide because the emperor Tiberius would not allow him to control a Roman province. Livia Ocellina became the second wife of Galba&#x27;s father, whom she may have married because of his wealth; he was short and hunchbacked. Ocellina adopted Galba, and he took the name &quot;Lucius Livius Ocella Sulpicius Galba&quot;, although he probably kept his original name in unofficial context, as evidenced by the fact that he reverted to it upon his accession as emperor. Galba preferred males over females in terms of sexual attraction; according to Suetonius, he &quot;preferred full-grown, strong men&quot;. Nevertheless, he married a woman named Aemilia Lepida and had two sons. Aemilia and their sons died during the early years of the reign of Claudius (r. 41–54). Galba would remain a widower for the rest of his life.

== Public service ==
Galba became praetor in about 30, then governor of Aquitania for about a year, then consul in 33. In 39 the emperor Caligula learned of a plot against himself in which Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus, the general of the legions of Germania Superior, was an important figure; Caligula installed Galba in the post held by Gaetulicus. According to one report Galba ran alongside Caligula&#x27;s chariot for twenty miles. As commander of the legions of Germania Superior, Galba gained a reputation as a disciplinarian. Suetonius writes that Galba was advised to take the throne following the assassination of Caligula in 41, but loyally served Caligula&#x27;s uncle and successor Claudius (r. 41–54); this story may simply be fictional. Galba was appointed as governor of Africa in 44 or 45. He retired at an uncertain time during the reign of Claudius, possibly in 49. He was recalled in 59 or 60 by the emperor Nero (r. 54–68) to govern Hispania.

A rebellion against Nero was orchestrated by Gaius Julius Vindex in Gaul on the anniversary of the death of Nero&#x27;s mother, Agrippina the Younger, in 68. Shortly afterwards Galba, in rebellion against Nero, rejected the title &quot;General of Caesar&quot; in favor of &quot;General of The Senate and People of Rome&quot;. He was supported by the imperial official Tigellinus. At midnight on 8 June, another imperial official, Nymphidius Sabinus, falsely announced to the Praetorian Guard that Nero had fled to Egypt, and the Senate proclaimed Galba emperor. Nero then committed assisted suicide with help from his secretary.

==Emperor==

===Rule (June 68-January 69)===

Upon becoming emperor, Galba was faced by the rebellion of Nymphidius Sabinus, who had his own aspirations for the imperial throne. However, Sabinus was killed by the Praetorians before he could take the throne. While Galba was arriving to Rome with the Lusitanian governor Marcus Salvius Otho, his army was attacked by a legion that had been organized by Nero; a number of Galba&#x27;s troops were killed in the fighting. Galba, who suffered from chronic gout by the time he came to the throne, was advised by a corrupt group which included the general Titus Vinius, commander of one of the legions in Hispania; the praetorian prefect Cornelius Laco, and Icelus, a freedman of Galba. Galba seized the property of Roman citizens, disbanded the Germanian legions, and did not pay the Praetorians and the soldiers who fought against Vindex. These actions caused him to become unpopular.

Suetonius wrote the following descriptions of Galba&#x27;s character and physical description:

Particularly bad was his becoming under the influence of Vinius, Laco and Icelus: 


In regard to his appointment of Vitellius to Germania Inferior:

Further on his physical appearance and end of reign:

Tacitus comments on the character of Galba: &quot;He seemed too great to be a subject so long as he was subject, and all would have agreed that he was equal to the imperial office if he had never held it.&quot;

Suetonius went on to say that Galba was visited by the Roman Goddess Fortuna in his dreams twice; on the latter occasion she &quot;withdrew her support&quot;. This happened right before his later downfall.

===Mutiny on the frontier and assassination===

On 1 January 69, the day Galba and Vinius took the office of consul, the fourth and twenty-second legions of Germania Superior refused to swear loyalty to Galba. They toppled his statues, demanding that a new emperor be chosen. On the following day, the soldiers of Germania Inferior also refused to swear their loyalty and proclaimed the governor of the province, Aulus Vitellius, as emperor. Galba tried to ensure his authority as emperor was recognised by adopting the nobleman Lucius Calpurnius Piso Licinianus as his successor. Nevertheless, Galba was killed by the Praetorians on 15 January. Otho was angry that he had been passed over for adoption, and organised a conspiracy with a small number of Praetorian Guards to murder the aged emperor and elevate himself. The soldiery in the capital, composed not just of Praetorians but of Galba&#x27;s legion from Hispania and several detachments of men from the Roman fleet, Illyria, Britannia, and Germania, were angered at not having received a donative. They also resented Galba&#x27;s purges of their officers and fellow soldiers (this was especially true of the men from the fleet). Many in the Praetorian Guard were shaken by the recent murder of their Prefect Nymphidius Sabinus – some of the waverers were convinced to come over to Otho&#x27;s side out of fear Galba might yet take revenge on them for their connection to Sabinus.

According to Suetonius, Galba put on a linen corset although remarking it was little protection against so many swords; when a soldier claimed to have killed Otho, Galba snapped &quot;On what authority?&quot;. He was lured out to the scene of his assassination in the Forum by a false report of the conspirators. Galba either tried to buy his life with a promise of the withheld bounty or asked that he be beheaded. The only help for him was a centurion in the Praetorian Guard named Sempronius Densus, who was killed trying to defend Galba with a pugio; one hundred and twenty persons later petitioned Otho that they had killed Galba; they would be executed by Vitellius. A company of Germanic soldiers to whom he had once done a kindness rushed to help him; however they took a wrong turn and arrived too late. He was killed near the Lacus Curtius. Vinius tried to run away, calling out that Otho had not ordered him killed, but was run through with a spear. Laco was banished to an island where he was later murdered by soldiers of Otho. Icelus was publicly executed. Piso was also killed; his head along with Galba&#x27;s and Vinius&#x27; were placed on poles and Otho was then acclaimed as emperor. Galba&#x27;s head was brought by a soldier to Otho&#x27;s camp where camp boys mocked it on a lance – Galba had angered them previously by remarking his vigor was still unimpeded. Vinius&#x27; head was sold to his daughter for 2500 drachmas; Piso&#x27;s head was given to his wife. Galba&#x27;s head was bought for 100 gold pieces by a freeman who threw it at Sessorium where his master Patrobius Neronianus had been killed by Galba. The body of Galba was taken up by Priscus Helvidius with the permission of Otho; at night Galba&#x27;s steward Argivus took both the head and body to a tomb in Galba&#x27;s private gardens on the Aurelian Way.

<doc id="12577" wikidata="Q108483" url="?curid=12577" title="Giga-">
<text>Giga- ( or ) is a unit prefix in the metric system denoting a factor of a short-scale billion or long-scale milliard (109 or 1,000,000,000). It has the symbol G.

&quot;Giga-&quot; is derived from the Greek word (&quot;gígas&quot;), meaning &quot;&quot;. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; reports the earliest written use of &quot;giga&quot; in this sense to be in the Reports of the IUPAC 14th Conférence Internationale de Chimie in 1947: &quot;The following prefixes to abbreviations for the names of units should be used: G giga 109×.&quot; However, it was already used in 1932 by the German organization &quot;Verband deutscher Elektrotechniker&quot;.

When referring to information units in computing, such as gigabyte, giga may sometimes mean (230); this causes ambiguity. Standards organizations discourage this and use giga- to refer to 109 in this context too. &quot;Gigabit&quot; is only rarely used with the binary interpretation of the prefix. The binary prefix gibi has been adopted for 230, while reserving &quot;giga&quot; exclusively for the metric definition.

==Pronunciation==
In English, the prefix &quot;giga&quot; can be pronounced (a hard &quot;g&quot; as in &quot;giggle&quot;), or (a soft &quot;g&quot; as in &quot;gigantic&quot;, which shares &quot;giga&quot; Ancient Greek root). A prominent example of this latter pronunciation is found in the pronunciation of &quot;gigawatts&quot; in the 1985 film &quot;Back to the Future&quot;.

According to the American writer Kevin Self, a German committee member of the International Electrotechnical Commission proposed &quot;giga&quot; as a prefix for 109 in the 1920s, drawing on a verse (evidently &quot;Anto-logie&quot;) by the German humorous poet Christian Morgenstern that appeared in the third (1908) edition of his (Gallows Songs). This suggests that a hard German was originally intended as the pronunciation. Self was unable to ascertain when the (soft &quot;g&quot;) pronunciation came into occasional use, but claimed that as of 1995 it had returned to (hard &quot;g&quot;).

In 1998, a poll by the phonetician John C. Wells found that 84% of Britons preferred the pronunciation of &quot;gigabyte&quot; starting with (as in &quot;gig&quot;), 9% with (as in &quot;jig&quot;), 6% with (&quot;guy&quot;), and 1% with (as in &quot;giant&quot;).

==Common usage==
* gigahertz—clock rate of a CPU, for instance, 3 GHz = 
* gigabit—bandwidth of a network link, for instance, 1 Gbit/s = .
* gigabyte—for instance, for hard disk capacity, 120 GB = ;
* gigayear or gigaannum—one billion (109) years, sometimes abbreviated Gyr, but the preferred usage is Ga or, for &quot;years ago&quot;, GA.

==Binary prefix==
The notation represents 1,000,000,000 bytes or, in deprecated usage, 1,073,741,824 (230) bytes. Per IEC 60027-2 A.2 and ISO/IEC 80000 standards, the correct notation of 230 is &quot;gibi&quot; (symbol Gi). One gibibyte () is 1,073,741,824 bytes or . Despite international standards, the use of = 230 B is widespread. A laptop advertised as having has 8,589,934,592 bytes of memory: , or .

<doc id="12578" wikidata="Q133614" url="?curid=12578" title="George Stephenson">
<text>George Stephenson (9 June 1781 – 12 August 1848) was an English civil engineer and mechanical engineer during the Industrial Revolution. Renowned as the &quot;Father of Railways&quot;, Stephenson was considered by the Victorians as a great example of diligent application and thirst for improvement. His chosen rail gauge, sometimes called &quot;Stephenson gauge&quot;, was the basis for the standard gauge used by most of the world&#x27;s railways.

Pioneered by Stephenson, rail transport was one of the most important technological inventions of the 19th century and a key component of the Industrial Revolution. Built by George and his son Robert&#x27;s company Robert Stephenson and Company, the &quot;Locomotion&quot; No. 1 was the first steam locomotive to carry passengers on a public rail line, the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825. George also built the first public inter-city railway line in the world to use locomotives, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which opened in 1830.

==Childhood==
George Stephenson was born on 9 June 1781 in Wylam, Northumberland, which is 9 miles (15 km) west of Newcastle upon Tyne. He was the second child of Robert and Mabel Stephenson, neither of whom could read or write. Robert was the fireman for Wylam Colliery pumping engine, earning a very low wage, so there was no money for schooling. At 17, Stephenson became an engineman at Water Row Pit in Newburn nearby. George realised the value of education and paid to study at night school to learn reading, writing and arithmetic – he was illiterate until the age of 18.

In 1801 he began work at Black Callerton Colliery south of Ponteland as a &#x27;brakesman&#x27;, controlling the winding gear at the pit. In 1802 he married Frances Henderson and moved to Willington Quay, east of Newcastle. There he worked as a brakesman while they lived in one room of a cottage. George made shoes and mended clocks to supplement his income.
Their first child Robert was born in 1803, and in 1804 they moved to Dial Cottage at West Moor, near Killingworth where George worked as a brakesman at Killingworth Pit. Their second child, a daughter, was born in July 1805. She was named Frances after her mother. The child died after just three weeks and was buried in St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, Long Benton north of Newcastle.

In 1806 George&#x27;s wife Frances died of consumption (tuberculosis). She was buried in the same churchyard as their daughter on 16 May 1806, though the location of the grave is lost.

George decided to find work in Scotland and left Robert with a local woman while he went to work in Montrose. After a few months he returned, probably because his father was blinded in a mining accident. He moved back into a cottage at West Moor and his unmarried sister Eleanor moved in to look after Robert. In 1811 the pumping engine at High Pit, Killingworth was not working properly and Stephenson offered to improve it. He did so with such success that he was promoted to enginewright for the collieries at Killingworth, responsible for maintaining and repairing all the colliery engines. He became an expert in steam-driven machinery.

== Early projects ==
===The Safety Lamp===

In 1815, aware of the explosions often caused in mines by naked flames, Stephenson began to experiment with a safety lamp that would burn in a gaseous atmosphere without causing an explosion. At the same time, the eminent scientist and Cornishman Humphry Davy was also looking at the problem. Despite his lack of scientific knowledge, Stephenson, by trial and error, devised a lamp in which the air entered via tiny holes, through which the flames of the lamp could not pass.

A month before Davy presented his design to the Royal Society, Stephenson demonstrated his own lamp to two witnesses by taking it down Killingworth Colliery and holding it in front of a fissure from which firedamp was issuing. The two designs differed; Davy&#x27;s lamp was surrounded by a screen of gauze, whereas Stephenson&#x27;s prototype lamp had a perforated plate containing a glass cylinder. For his invention Davy was awarded £2000, whilst Stephenson was accused of stealing the idea from Davy, because he was not seen as an adequate scientist who could have produced the lamp by any approved scientific method.

Stephenson, having come from the North-East, spoke with a broad Northumberland accent and not the &#x27;Language of Parliament,&#x27; which made him seem lowly. Realizing this, he made a point of educating his son Robert in a private school, where he was taught to speak in Standard English with a Received Pronunciation accent. It was due to this, in their future dealings with Parliament, that it became clear that the authorities preferred Robert to his father.

A local committee of enquiry gathered in support of Stephenson, exonerated him, proved he had been working separately to create the &#x27;Geordie Lamp&#x27;, and awarded him £1,000, but Davy and his supporters refused to accept their findings, and would not see how an uneducated man such as Stephenson could come up with the solution he had. In 1833 a House of Commons committee found that Stephenson had equal claim to having invented the safety lamp. Davy went to his grave believing that Stephenson had stolen his idea. The Stephenson lamp was used almost exclusively in North East England, whereas the Davy lamp was used everywhere else. The experience gave Stephenson a lifelong distrust of London-based, theoretical, scientific experts.

In his book &quot;George and Robert Stephenson&quot;, the author L.T.C. Rolt relates that opinion varied about the two lamps&#x27; efficiency: that the Davy Lamp gave more light, but the Geordie Lamp was thought to be safer in a more gaseous atmosphere. He made reference to an incident at Oaks Colliery in Barnsley where both lamps were in use. Following a sudden strong influx of gas the tops of all the Davy Lamps became red hot (which had in the past caused an explosion, and in so doing risked another), whilst all the Geordie Lamps simply went out.

There is a theory that it was Stephenson who indirectly gave the name of &quot;Geordies&quot; to the people of the North East of England. By this theory, the name of the Geordie Lamp attached to the North East pit men themselves. By 1866 any native of Newcastle upon Tyne could be called a Geordie.

===Locomotives===
Cornishman Richard Trevithick is credited with the first realistic design for a steam locomotive, the &quot;Puffing Devil&quot;, in 1801. Later, he visited Tyneside and built an engine there for a mine-owner. Several local men were inspired by this, and designed their own engines.
Stephenson designed his first locomotive in 1814, a travelling engine designed for hauling coal on the Killingworth wagonway named &quot;Blücher&quot; after the Prussian general Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher (It was suggested the name sprang from Blücher&#x27;s rapid march of his army in support of Wellington at Waterloo). &quot;Blücher&quot; was modelled on Matthew Murray&#x27;s locomotive &quot;Willington&quot;, which George studied at Kenton and Coxlodge colliery on Tyneside, and was constructed in the colliery workshop behind Stephenson&#x27;s home, Dial Cottage, on Great Lime Road. The locomotive could haul 30 tons of coal up a hill at , and was the first successful flanged-wheel adhesion locomotive: its traction depended on contact between its flanged wheels and the rail.

Altogether, Stephenson is said to have produced 16 locomotives at Killingworth, although it has not proved possible to produce a convincing list of all 16. Of those identified, most were built for use at Killingworth or for the Hetton colliery railway. A six-wheeled locomotive was built for the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway in 1817 but was withdrawn from service because of damage to the cast-iron rails. Another locomotive was supplied to Scott&#x27;s Pit railroad at Llansamlet, near Swansea, in 1819 but it too was withdrawn, apparently because it was under-boilered and again caused damage to the track.
The new engines were too heavy to run on wooden rails or plate-way, and iron edge rails were in their infancy, with cast iron exhibiting excessive brittleness. Together with William Losh, Stephenson improved the design of cast-iron edge rails to reduce breakage; rails were briefly made by Losh, Wilson and Bell at their Walker ironworks.

According to Rolt, Stephenson managed to solve the problem caused by the weight of the engine on the primitive rails. He experimented with a steam spring (to &#x27;cushion&#x27; the weight using steam pressure acting on pistons to support the locomotive frame), but soon followed the practice of &#x27;distributing&#x27; weight by using a number of wheels or bogies. For the Stockton and Darlington Railway Stephenson used wrought-iron malleable rails that he had found satisfactory, notwithstanding the financial loss he suffered by not using his own patented design.

=== Hetton Railway ===

Stephenson was hired to build the eight-mile (13-km) Hetton colliery railway in 1820. He used a combination of gravity on downward inclines and locomotives for level and upward stretches. This, the first railway using no animal power, opened in 1822. This line used a gauge of which Stephenson had used before at the Killingworth wagonway.

Other locomotives include:
* 1817–1824 &quot;The Duke&quot; for the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway

== The First Railways ==

===Stockton and Darlington Railway===

In 1821, a parliamentary bill was passed to allow the building of the Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&amp;DR). The railway connected collieries near Bishop Auckland to the River Tees at Stockton, passing through Darlington on the way. The original plan was to use horses to draw coal carts on metal rails, but after company director Edward Pease met Stephenson, he agreed to change the plans. Stephenson surveyed the line in 1821, and assisted by his 18-year-old son Robert, construction began the same year.
A manufacturer was needed to provide the locomotives for the line. Pease and Stephenson had jointly established a company in Newcastle to manufacture locomotives. It was set up as Robert Stephenson and Company, and George&#x27;s son Robert was the managing director. A fourth partner was Michael Longridge of Bedlington Ironworks. On an early trade card, Robert Stephenson &amp; Co was described as &quot;Engineers, Millwrights &amp; Machinists, Brass &amp; Iron Founders&quot;. In September 1825, the works at Forth Street, Newcastle, completed the first locomotive for the railway: originally named &quot;Active&quot;, it was renamed &quot;Locomotion&quot; and was followed by &quot;Hope&quot;, &quot;Diligence&quot; and &quot;Black Diamond&quot;. The Stockton and Darlington Railway opened on 27 September 1825. Driven by Stephenson, &quot;Locomotion&quot; hauled an 80-ton load of coal and flour in two hours, reaching a speed of on one stretch. The first purpose-built passenger car, &quot;Experiment&quot;, was attached and carried dignitaries on the opening journey. It was the first time passenger traffic had been run on a steam locomotive railway.

The rails used for the line were wrought-iron, produced by John Birkinshaw at the Bedlington Ironworks. Wrought-iron rails could be produced in longer lengths than cast-iron and were less liable to crack under the weight of heavy locomotives. William Losh of Walker Ironworks thought he had an agreement with Stephenson to supply cast-iron rails, and Stephenson&#x27;s decision caused a permanent rift between them. The gauge Stephenson chose for the line was which subsequently was adopted as the standard gauge for railways, not only in Britain, but throughout the world.

===Liverpool and Manchester Railway===
Stephenson had ascertained by experiments at Killingworth that half the power of the locomotive was consumed by a gradient as little as 1 in 260. He concluded that railways should be kept as level as possible. He used this knowledge while working on the Bolton and Leigh Railway, and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&amp;MR), executing a series of difficult cuttings, embankments and stone viaducts to level their routes. Defective surveying of the original route of the L&amp;MR caused by hostility from some affected landowners meant Stephenson encountered difficulty during Parliamentary scrutiny of the original bill, especially under cross-examination by Edward Hall Alderson. The bill was rejected and a revised bill for a new alignment was submitted and passed in a subsequent session. The revised alignment presented the problem of crossing Chat Moss, an apparently bottomless peat bog, which Stephenson overcame by unusual means, effectively floating the line across it. The method he used was similar to that used by John Metcalf who constructed many miles of road across marshes in the Pennines, laying a foundation of heather and branches, which became bound together by the weight of the passing coaches, with a layer of stones on top.

As the L&amp;MR approached completion in 1829, its directors arranged a competition to decide who would build its locomotives, and the Rainhill Trials were run in October 1829. Entries could weigh no more than six tons and had to travel along the track for a total distance of . Stephenson&#x27;s entry was &quot;Rocket&quot;, and its performance in winning the contest made it famous. George&#x27;s son Robert had been working in South America from 1824 to 1827 and returned to run the Forth Street Works while George was in Liverpool overseeing the construction of the line. Robert was responsible for the detailed design of &quot;Rocket&quot;, although he was in constant postal communication with his father, who made many suggestions. One significant innovation, suggested by Henry Booth, treasurer of the L&amp;MR, was the use of a fire-tube boiler, invented by French engineer Marc Seguin that gave improved heat exchange.

The opening ceremony of the L&amp;MR, on 15 September 1830, drew luminaries from the government and industry, including the Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington. The day started with a procession of eight trains setting out from Liverpool. The parade was led by &quot;Northumbrian&quot; driven by George Stephenson, and included &quot;Phoenix&quot; driven by his son Robert, &quot;North Star&quot; driven by his brother Robert and &quot;Rocket&quot; driven by assistant engineer Joseph Locke. The day was marred by the death of William Huskisson, the Member of Parliament for Liverpool, who was struck by &quot;Rocket&quot;. Stephenson evacuated the injured Huskisson to Eccles with a train, but he died from his injuries. Despite the tragedy, the railway was a resounding success. Stephenson became famous, and was offered the position of chief engineer for a wide variety of other railways.

===Stephenson&#x27;s skew arch bridge===

1830 also saw the grand opening of the skew bridge in Rainhill over the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The bridge was the first to cross any railway at an angle. It required the structure to be constructed as two flat planes (overlapping in this case by ) between which the stonework forms a parallelogram shape when viewed from above. It has the effect of flattening the arch and the solution is to lay the bricks forming the arch at an angle to the abutments (the piers on which the arches rest). The technique, which results in a spiral effect in the arch masonry, provides extra strength in the arch to compensate for the angled abutments.

The bridge is still in use at Rainhill station, and carries traffic on the A57 (Warrington Road). The bridge is a listed structure.

== Later life ==
===Life at Alton Grange===

George Stephenson moved to the parish of Alton Grange (now part of Ravenstone) in Leicestershire in 1830, originally to consult on the Leicester and Swannington Railway, a line primarily proposed to take coal from the western coal fields of the county to Leicester. The promoters of the line Mr William Stenson and Mr John Ellis, had difficulties in raising the necessary capital as the majority of local wealth had been invested in canals. Realising the potential and need for the rail link Stephenson himself invested £2,500 and raised the remaining capital through his network of connections in Liverpool. His son Robert was made chief engineer with the first part of the line opening in 1832.

During this same period the Snibston estate in Leicestershire came up for auction, it lay adjoining the proposed Swannington to Leicester route and was believed to contain valuable coal reserves. Stephenson realising the financial potential of the site, given its proximity to the proposed rail link and the fact that the manufacturing town of Leicester was then being supplied coal by canal from Derbyshire, bought the estate.

Employing a previously used method of mining in the midlands called tubbing to access the deep coal seams, his success could not have been greater. Stephenson&#x27;s coal mine delivered the first rail cars of coal into Leicester dramatically reducing the price of coal and saving the city some £40,000 per annum.

Stephenson remained at Alton Grange until 1838 before moving to Tapton House in Derbyshire.

===Later career===
The next ten years were the busiest of Stephenson&#x27;s life as he was besieged with requests from railway promoters. Many of the first American railroad builders came to Newcastle to learn from Stephenson and the first dozen or so locomotives utilised there were purchased from the Stephenson shops. Stephenson&#x27;s conservative views on the capabilities of locomotives meant he favoured circuitous routes and civil engineering that were more costly than his successors thought necessary. For example, rather than the West Coast Main Line taking the direct route favoured by Joseph Locke over Shap between Lancaster and Carlisle, Stephenson was in favour of a longer sea-level route via Ulverston and Whitehaven. Locke&#x27;s route was built.

Stephenson tended to be more casual in estimating costs and paperwork in general. He worked with Joseph Locke on the Grand Junction Railway with half of the line allocated to each man. Stephenson&#x27;s estimates and organising ability proved inferior to those of Locke and the board&#x27;s dissatisfaction led to Stephenson&#x27;s resignation causing a rift between them which was never healed.

Despite Stephenson&#x27;s loss of some routes to competitors due to his caution, he was offered more work than he could cope with, and was unable to accept all that was offered. He worked on the North Midland line from Derby to Leeds, the York and North Midland line from Normanton to York, the Manchester and Leeds, the Birmingham and Derby, the Sheffield and Rotherham among many others.

Stephenson became a reassuring name rather than a cutting-edge technical adviser. He was the first president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers on its formation in 1847. By this time he had settled into semi-retirement, supervising his mining interests in Derbyshire – tunnelling for the North Midland Railway revealed coal seams, and Stephenson put money into their exploitation.

===Personal life===

George first courted Elizabeth (Betty) Hindmarsh, a farmer&#x27;s daughter from Black Callerton, whom he met secretly in her orchard. Her father refused marriage because of Stephenson&#x27;s lowly status as a miner. George next paid attention to Anne Henderson where he lodged with her family, but she rejected him and he transferred his attentions to her sister Frances (Fanny), who was nine years his senior. George and Fanny married at Newburn Church on 28 November 1802. They had two children Robert (1803) and Fanny (1805) but the latter died within months. George&#x27;s wife died, probably of tuberculosis, the year after. While George was working in Scotland, Robert was brought up by a succession of neighbours and then by George&#x27;s unmarried sister Eleanor (Nelly), who lived with them in Killingworth on George&#x27;s return.

On 29 March 1820, George (now considerably wealthier) married Betty Hindmarsh at Newburn. The marriage seems to have been happy, but there were no children and Betty died on 3 August 1845.

On 11 January 1848, at St Chad&#x27;s Church in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, George married for the third time, to Ellen Gregory, another farmer&#x27;s daughter originally from Bakewell in Derbyshire, who had been his housekeeper. Seven months after his wedding, George contracted pleurisy and died, aged 67, at noon on Saturday 12 August 1848 at Tapton House in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. He was buried at Holy Trinity Church, Chesterfield, alongside his second wife.

Described by Rolt as a generous man, Stephenson financially supported the wives and families of several who had died in his employment, due to accident or misadventure, some within his family, and some not. He was also a keen gardener throughout his life; during his last years at Tapton House, he built hothouses in the estate gardens, growing exotic fruits and vegetables in a &#x27;not too friendly&#x27; rivalry with Joseph Paxton, head gardener at nearby Chatsworth House, twice beating the master of the craft.

====Descendants====
George Stephenson had two children. His son Robert was born on 16 October 1803. Robert married Frances Sanderson, daughter of a City of London professional John Sanderson, on 17 June 1829. Robert died in 1859 having no children. Robert Stephenson expanded on the work of his father and became a major railway engineer himself. Abroad, Robert was involved in the Alexandria–Cairo railway that later connected with the Suez Canal. George Stephenson&#x27;s daughter was born in 1805 but died within weeks of her birth. Descendants of the wider Stephenson family continue to live in Wylam (Stephenson&#x27;s birthplace) today. Also relatives connected by his marriage live in Derbyshire. Some descendants later emigrated to Perth, Australia, and Minnesota, with later generations remaining to this day.

This Stephenson engineering family is not to be confused with the lighthouse-building engineering family of Robert Stevenson, which was active in the same era. Note the spelling difference.

=== Influence ===

Britain led the world in the development of railways which acted as a stimulus for the Industrial Revolution by facilitating the transport of raw materials and manufactured goods. George Stephenson, with his work on the Stockton and Darlington Railway and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, paved the way for the railway engineers who followed, such as his son Robert, his assistant Joseph Locke who carried out much work on his own account and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Stephenson was farsighted in realising that the individual lines being built would eventually be joined, and would need to have the same gauge. The standard gauge used throughout much of the world is due to him. In 2002, Stephenson was named in the BBC&#x27;s television show and list of the &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot; following a UK-wide vote, placing at no. 65.

The Victorian self-help advocate Samuel Smiles had published his first biography of George Stephenson in 1857, and although attacked as biased in the favour of George at the expense his rivals as well as his son, it was popular and 250,000 copies were sold by 1904. The Band of Hope were selling biographies of George in 1859 at a penny a sheet, and at one point there was a suggestion to move George&#x27;s body to Westminster Abbey. The centenary of George&#x27;s birth was celebrated in 1881 at Crystal Palace by 15,000 people, and it was George who was featured on the reverse of the Series E five pound note issued by the Bank of England between 1990 and 2003. The Stephenson Railway Museum in North Shields is named after George and Robert Stephenson.

===Memorials===
George Stephenson&#x27;s Birthplace is an 18th-century historic house museum in the village of Wylam, and is operated by the National Trust. Dial Cottage at West Moor, his home from 1804, remains but the museum that once operated there has closed.

Chesterfield Museum in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, has a gallery of Stephenson memorabilia, including straight thick glass tubes he invented for growing straight cucumbers. The museum is in the Stephenson Memorial Hall not far from both Stephenson&#x27;s final home at Tapton House and Holy Trinity Church within which is his vault. In Liverpool, where he lived at 34 Upper Parliament Street, a City of Liverpool Heritage Plaque is situated next to the front door.

Stephenson College, founded in 2001 on the Durham University&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Campus in Stockton-on-Tees (relocated to Durham in 2018), is named after him. Also named after him and his son is George Stephenson High School in Killingworth, Stephenson Memorial Primary School in Howdon, the Stephenson Railway Museum in North Shields, the Stephenson Locomotive Society, the Stephenson Centre, an SEBD Unit of Beaumont Hill School in Darlington, and the Stephenson Building, home of the school of engineering at Newcastle University. His last home in Tapton, Chesterfield is now part of Chesterfield College and is called Tapton House Campus.

As a tribute to his life and works, a bronze statue of Stephenson was unveiled at Chesterfield railway station (in the town where Stephenson spent the last ten years of his life) on 28 October 2005, marking the completion of improvements to the station. At the event a full-size working replica of the &quot;Rocket&quot; was on show, which then spent two days on public display at the Chesterfield Market Festival. A statue of him dressed in classical robes stands in Neville Street, Newcastle, facing the buildings that house the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne and the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers, near Newcastle railway station. The statue was sculpted in 1862 by John Graham Lough and is listed Grade II.

From 1990 until 2003, Stephenson&#x27;s portrait appeared on the reverse of Series E £5 notes issued by the Bank of England. Stephenson&#x27;s face is shown alongside an engraving of the &quot;Rocket&quot; steam engine and the Skerne Bridge on the Stockton to Darlington Railway.

Stephenson&#x27;s profile is carved in the facade of Lisbon&#x27;s Victorian railway station.

North-western Milan has the street Via Giorgio Stephenson in his honour.

===In popular culture===
Stephenson was portrayed by actor Gawn Grainger on television in the 1985 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot;.

Harry Turtledove&#x27;s alternate history short story &quot;The Iron Elephant&quot; depicts a race between a newly invented steam engine and a mammoth-drawn train in 1782. A station master called George Stephenson features as a minor character alongside an American steam engineer called Richard Trevithick, likely indicating that they were analogous rather than historical characters.

<doc id="12579" wikidata="Q2545446" url="?curid=12579" title="Grapheme">
<text>In linguistics, a grapheme is the smallest functional unit of a writing system.
The word &quot;grapheme&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek (&#x27;write&#x27;), and the suffix &quot;-eme&quot; by analogy with &quot;phoneme&quot; and other emic units. The study of graphemes is called &quot;graphemics&quot;. The concept of graphemes is abstract and similar to the notion in computing of a character. By comparison, a specific shape that represents any particular grapheme in a given typeface is called a glyph.

==Conceptualization==
There are two main opposing grapheme concepts.

In the so-called &quot;referential conception&quot;, graphemes are interpreted as the smallest units of writing that correspond with sounds (more accurately phonemes). In this concept, the &quot;sh&quot; in the written English word &quot;shake&quot; would be a grapheme because it represents the phoneme /ʃ/. This referential concept is linked to the &quot;dependency hypothesis&quot; that claims that writing merely depicts speech.

By contrast, the &quot;analogical concept&quot; defines graphemes analogously to phonemes, i.e. via written minimal pairs such as &quot;shake&quot; vs. &quot;snake&quot;. In this example, &quot;h&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are graphemes because they distinguish two words. This analogical concept is associated with the autonomy hypothesis which holds that writing is a system in its own right and should be studied independently from speech. Both concepts have weaknesses.

Some models adhere to both concepts simultaneously by including two individual units, which are given names such as &quot;graphemic grapheme&quot; for the grapheme according to the analogical conception (&quot;h&quot; in &quot;shake&quot;), and &quot;phonological-fit grapheme&quot; for the grapheme according to the referential concept (&quot;sh&quot; in &quot;shake&quot;).

In newer concepts, in which the grapheme is interpreted semiotically as a dyadic linguistic sign, it is defined as a minimal unit of writing that is both lexically distinctive and corresponds with a linguistic unit (phoneme, syllable, or morpheme).

==Notation==

Graphemes are often notated within angle brackets: e.g. . This is analogous to the slash notation used for phonemes. Analogous to the square bracket notation used for phones, glyphs are sometimes denoted with vertical lines, e.g. .

==Glyphs==

In the same way that the surface forms of phonemes are speech sounds or phones (and different phones representing the same phoneme are called allophones), the surface forms of graphemes are glyphs (sometimes &quot;graphs&quot;), namely concrete written representations of symbols (and different glyphs representing the same grapheme are called allographs).

Thus, a grapheme can be regarded as an abstraction of a collection of glyphs that are all functionally equivalent.

For example, in written English (or other languages using the Latin alphabet), there are two different physical representations of the lowercase Latin letter &quot;a&quot;: &quot;a&quot; and &quot;ɑ&quot;. Since, however, the substitution of either of them for the other cannot change the meaning of a word, they are considered to be allographs of the same grapheme, which can be written . Similarly, the grapheme corresponding to &quot;Arabic numeral zero&quot; has a unique semantic identity and Unicode value but exhibits variation in the form of slashed zero. Italic and bold face forms are also allographic, as is the variation seen in serif (as in Times New Roman) versus sans-serif (as in Helvetica) forms.

There is some disagreement as to whether capital and lower case letters are allographs or distinct graphemes. Capitals are generally found in certain triggering contexts that do not change the meaning of a word: a proper name, for example, or at the beginning of a sentence, or all caps in a newspaper headline. In other contexts, capitalization can determine meaning: compare, for example Polish and polish: the former is a language, the latter is for shining shoes.

Some linguists consider digraphs like the in &quot;ship&quot; to be distinct graphemes, but these are generally analyzed as sequences of graphemes. Non-stylistic ligatures, however, such as , are distinct graphemes, as are various letters with distinctive diacritics, such as .

Identical glyphs may not always represent the same grapheme. For example, the three letters , and appear identical but each has a different meaning: in order, they are the Latin letter A, the Cyrillic letter Azǔ/Азъ and the Greek letter Alpha. Each has its own code point in Unicode: , and .

==Types of grapheme==

The principal types of graphemes are logograms (more accurately termed morphograms), which represent words or morphemes (for example Chinese characters, the ampersand &quot;&amp;&quot; representing the word &quot;and&quot;, Arabic numerals); syllabic characters, representing syllables (as in Japanese kana); and alphabetic letters, corresponding roughly to phonemes (see next section). For a full discussion of the different types, see .

There are additional graphemic components used in writing, such as punctuation marks, mathematical symbols, word dividers such as the space, and other typographic symbols. Ancient logographic scripts often used silent determinatives to disambiguate the meaning of a neighboring (non-silent) word.

==Relationship with phonemes==

As mentioned in the previous section, in languages that use alphabetic writing systems, many of the graphemes stand in principle for the phonemes (significant sounds) of the language. In practice, however, the orthographies of such languages entail at least a certain amount of deviation from the ideal of exact grapheme–phoneme correspondence. A phoneme may be represented by a multigraph (sequence of more than one grapheme), as the digraph &quot;sh&quot; represents a single sound in English (and sometimes a single grapheme may represent more than one phoneme, as with the Russian letter я or the Spanish c). Some graphemes may not represent any sound at all (like the &quot;b&quot; in English &quot;debt&quot; or the &quot;h&quot; in all Spanish words containing the said letter), and often the rules of correspondence between graphemes and phonemes become complex or irregular, particularly as a result of historical sound changes that are not necessarily reflected in spelling. &quot;Shallow&quot; orthographies such as those of standard Spanish and Finnish have relatively regular (though not always one-to-one) correspondence between graphemes and phonemes, while those of French and English have much less regular correspondence, and are known as deep orthographies.

Multigraphs representing a single phoneme are normally treated as combinations of separate letters, not as graphemes in their own right. However, in some languages a multigraph may be treated as a single unit for the purposes of collation; for example, in a Czech dictionary, the section for words that start with comes after that for .

<doc id="12581" wikidata="Q11469" url="?curid=12581" title="Glass">
<text>Glass is an amorphous (non-crystalline) solid. Because it is often transparent and chemically inert, glass has found widespread practical, technological, and decorative use in window panes, tableware, and optics. Some common objects made of glass are named after the material, e.g., a &quot;glass&quot; for drinking, &quot;glasses&quot; for vision correction, and a &quot;magnifying glass&quot;.

Glass is most often formed by rapid cooling (quenching) of the molten form. Some glasses such as volcanic glass are naturally occurring, and obsidian has been used to make arrowheads and knives since the Stone Age. Archaeological evidence suggests glassmaking dates back to at least 3600 BC in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or Syria. The earliest known glass objects were beads, perhaps created accidentally during metalworking or the production of faience, which is a form of pottery using lead glazes.

Due to its ease of formability into any shape, glass has been traditionally used for vessels, such as bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. Soda–lime glass, containing around 70% silica, accounts for around 90% of modern manufactured glass. Glass can be coloured by adding metal salts or painted and printed with vitreous enamels, leading to its use in stained glass windows and other glass art objects.

The refractive, reflective and transmission properties of glass make glass suitable for manufacturing optical lenses, prisms, and optoelectronics materials. Extruded glass fibres have applications as optical fibres in communications networks, thermal insulating material when matted as glass wool to trap air, or in glass-fibre reinforced plastic (fibreglass).

== Microscopic structure ==

The standard definition of a &quot;glass&quot; (or vitreous solid) is a non-crystalline solid formed by rapid melt quenching. However, the term &quot;glass&quot; is often defined in a broader sense, to describe any non-crystalline (amorphous) solid that exhibits a glass transition when heated towards the liquid state.

Glass is an amorphous solid. Although the atomic-scale structure of glass shares characteristics of the structure of a supercooled liquid, glass exhibits all the mechanical properties of a solid. As in other amorphous solids, the atomic structure of a glass lacks the long-range periodicity observed in crystalline solids. Due to chemical bonding constraints, glasses do possess a high degree of short-range order with respect to local atomic polyhedra. The notion that glass flows to an appreciable extent over extended periods well below the glass transition temperature is not supported by empirical research or theoretical analysis (see viscosity in solids). Though atomic motion at glass surfaces can be observed, and viscosity on the order of 1017–1018 Pa s can be measured in glass, such a high value reinforces the fact that glass would not change shape appreciably over even large periods of time.

=== Formation from a supercooled liquid ===
For melt quenching, if the cooling is sufficiently rapid (relative to the characteristic crystallization time) then crystallization is prevented and instead, the disordered atomic configuration of the supercooled liquid is frozen into the solid state at Tg. The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass-forming ability. This ability can be predicted by the rigidity theory. Generally, a glass exists in a structurally metastable state with respect to its crystalline form, although in certain circumstances, for example in atactic polymers, there is no crystalline analogue of the amorphous phase.

Glass is sometimes considered to be a liquid due to its lack of a first-order phase transition
where certain thermodynamic variables such as volume, entropy and enthalpy are discontinuous through the glass transition range. The glass transition may be described as analogous to a second-order phase transition where the intensive thermodynamic variables such as the thermal expansivity and heat capacity are discontinuous. However, the equilibrium theory of phase transformations does not hold for glass, and hence the glass transition cannot be classed as one of the classical equilibrium phase transformations in solids.

== Occurrence in nature ==
Glass can form naturally from volcanic magma. Obsidian is a common volcanic glass with high silica (SiO2) content formed when felsic lava extruded from a volcano cools rapidly. Impactite is a form of glass formed by the impact of a meteorite, where Moldavite (found in central and eastern Europe), and Libyan desert glass (found in areas in the eastern Sahara, the deserts of eastern Libya and western Egypt) are notable examples. Vitrification of quartz can also occur when lightning strikes sand, forming hollow, branching rootlike structures called fulgurites. Trinitite is a glassy residue formed from the desert floor sand at the Trinity nuclear bomb test site. Edeowie glass, found in South Australia, is proposed to originate from Pleistocene grassland fires, lightning strikes, or hypervelocity impact by one or several asteroids or comets.

== History ==
Naturally occurring obsidian glass was used by Stone Age societies as it fractures along very sharp edges, making it ideal for cutting tools and weapons.

Glassmaking dates back at least 6000 years, long before humans had discovered how to smelt iron. Archaeological evidence suggests that the first true synthetic glass was made in Lebanon and the coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or ancient Egypt. The earliest known glass objects, of the mid-third millennium BC, were beads, perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of metalworking (slags) or during the production of faience, a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing.

Early glass was rarely transparent and often contained impurities and imperfections, and is technically faience rather than true glass, which did not appear until the 15th century BC. However, red-orange glass beads excavated from the Indus Valley Civilization dated before 1700 BC (possibly as early as 1900 BC) predate sustained glass production, which appeared around 1600 BC in Mesopotamia and 1500 BC in Egypt.

During the Late Bronze Age, there was a rapid growth in glassmaking technology in Egypt and Western Asia. Archaeological finds from this period include coloured glass ingots, vessels, and beads.

Much early glass production relied on grinding techniques borrowed from stoneworking, such as grinding and carving glass in a cold state.

The term &quot;glass&quot; has its origins in the late Roman Empire, in the Roman glass making centre at Trier (located in current-day Germany) where the late-Latin term &quot;glesum&quot; originated, likely from a Germanic word for a transparent, lustrous substance. Glass objects have been recovered across the Roman Empire in domestic, funerary, and industrial contexts, as well as trade items in marketplaces in distant provinces. Examples of Roman glass have been found outside of the former Roman Empire in China, the Baltics, the Middle East, and India. The Romans perfected cameo glass, produced by etching and carving through fused layers of different colours to produce a design in relief on the glass object.

In post-classical West Africa, Benin was a manufacturer of glass and glass beads.
Glass was used extensively in Europe during the Middle Ages. Anglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. From the 10th century onwards, glass was employed in stained glass windows of churches and cathedrals, with famous examples at Chartres Cathedral and the Basilica of Saint-Denis. By the 14th century, architects were designing buildings with walls of stained glass such as Sainte-Chapelle, Paris, (1203–1248) and the East end of Gloucester Cathedral. With the change in architectural style during the Renaissance period in Europe, the use of large stained glass windows became much less prevalent, although stained glass had a major revival with Gothic Revival architecture in the 19th century.

During the 13th century, the island of Murano, Venice, became a centre for glass making, building on medieval techniques to produce colourful ornamental pieces in large quantities. Murano glass makers developed the exceptionally clear colourless glass cristallo, so called for its resemblance to natural crystal, which was extensively used for windows, mirrors, ships&#x27; lanterns, and lenses. In the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries, enamelling and gilding on glass vessels were perfected in Egypt and Syria. Towards the end of the 17th century, Bohemia became an important region for glass production, remaining so until the start of the 20th century. By the 17th century, glass in the Venetian tradition was also being produced in England. In about 1675, George Ravenscroft invented lead crystal glass, with cut glass becoming fashionable in the 18th century. Ornamental glass objects became an important art medium during the Art Nouveau period in the late 19th century.

Throughout the 20th century, new mass production techniques led to the widespread availability of glass in much larger amounts, making it practical as a building material and enabling new applications of glass. In the 1920s a mould-etch process was developed, in which art was etched directly into the mould so that each cast piece emerged from the mould with the image already on the surface of the glass. This reduced manufacturing costs and, combined with a wider use of coloured glass, led to cheap glassware in the 1930s, which later became known as Depression glass. In the 1950s, Pilkington Bros., England, developed the float glass process, producing high-quality distortion-free flat sheets of glass by floating on molten tin. Modern multi-story buildings are frequently constructed with curtain walls made almost entirely of glass. Laminated glass has been widely applied to vehicles for windscreens. Optical glass for spectacles has been used since the Middle Ages. The production of lenses has become increasingly proficient, aiding astronomers as well as having other applications in medicine and science. Glass is also employed as the aperture cover in many solar energy collectors.

In the 21st century, glass manufacturers have developed different brands of chemically strengthened glass for widespread application in touchscreens for smartphones, tablet computers, and many other types of information appliances. These include Gorilla Glass, developed and manufactured by Corning, AGC Inc.&#x27;s Dragontrail and Schott AG&#x27;s Xensation.

== Physical properties ==
=== Optical ===

Glass is in widespread use in optical systems due to its ability to refract, reflect, and transmit light following geometrical optics. The most common and oldest applications of glass in optics are as lenses, windows, mirrors, and prisms. The key optical properties refractive index, dispersion, and transmission, of glass are strongly dependent on chemical composition and, to a lesser degree, its thermal history. Optical glass typically has a refractive index of 1.4 to 2.4, and an Abbe number (which characterises dispersion) of 15 to 100. The refractive index may be modified by high-density (refractive index increases) or low-density (refractive index decreases) additives.

Glass transparency results from the absence of grain boundaries which diffusely scatter light in polycrystalline materials. Semi-opacity due to crystallization may be induced in many glasses by maintaining them for a long period at a temperature just insufficient to cause fusion. In this way, the crystalline, devitrified material, known as Réaumur&#x27;s glass porcelain is produced. Although generally transparent to visible light, glasses may be opaque to other wavelengths of light. While silicate glasses are generally opaque to infrared wavelengths with a transmission cut-off at 4 μm, heavy-metal fluoride and chalcogenide glasses are transparent to infrared wavelengths of 7 to 18 μm. The addition of metallic oxides results in different coloured glasses as the metallic ions will absorb wavelengths of light corresponding to specific colours.

=== Other ===
In the manufacturing process, glasses can be poured, formed, extruded and moulded into forms ranging from flat sheets to highly intricate shapes. The finished product is brittle but can be laminated or tempered to enhance durability. Glass is typically inert, resistant to chemical attack, and can mostly withstand the action of water, making it an ideal material for the manufacture of containers for foodstuffs and most chemicals. Nevertheless, although usually highly resistant to chemical attack, glass will corrode or dissolve under some conditions. The materials that make up a particular glass composition affect how quickly the glass corrodes. Glasses containing a high proportion of alkali or alkaline earth elements are more susceptible to corrosion than other glass compositions.

The density of glass varies with chemical composition with values ranging from for fused silica to for dense flint glass. Glass is stronger than most metals, with a theoretical tensile strength for pure, flawless glass estimated at due to its ability to undergo reversible compression without fracture. However, the presence of scratches, bubbles, and other microscopic flaws lead to a typical range of in most commercial glasses. Several processes such as toughening can increase the strength of glass. Carefully drawn flawless glass fibres can be produced with a strength of up to .
=== Reputed flow ===
The observation that old windows are sometimes found to be thicker at the bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view that glass flows over a timescale of centuries, the assumption being that the glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another. This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing. The sags and ripples observed in old glass were already there the day it was made; manufacturing processes used in the past produced sheets with imperfect surfaces and non-uniform thickness (the near-perfect float glass used today only became widespread in the 1960s).

A 2017 study computed the rate of flow of the medieval glass used in Westminster Abbey from the year 1268. The study found that the room temperature viscosity of this glass was roughly 1024Pa·s which is about 1016 times less viscous than a previous estimate made in 1998, which focused on soda-lime silicate glass. Even with this lower viscosity, the study authors calculated that the maximum flow rate of medieval glass is 1 nm per billion years, making it impossible to observe in a human timescale.

== Types ==
=== Silicate glasses ===

Silicon dioxide (SiO2) is a common fundamental constituent of glass. Fused quartz is a glass made from chemically pure silica. It has very low thermal expansion and excellent resistance to thermal shock, being able to survive immersion in water while red hot, resists high temperatures (1000–1500 °C) and chemical weathering, and is very hard. It is also transparent to a wider spectral range than ordinary glass, extending from the visible further into both the UV and IR ranges, and is sometimes used where transparency to these wavelengths is necessary. Fused quartz is used for high-temperature applications such as furnace tubes, lighting tubes, melting crucibles, etc. However, its high melting temperature (1723 °C) and viscosity make it difficult to work with. Therefore, normally, other substances (fluxes) are added to lower the melting temperature and simplify glass processing.

==== Soda–lime glass ====

Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, &quot;soda&quot;) is a common additive and acts to lower the glass-transition temperature. However, sodium silicate is water-soluble, so lime (CaO, calcium oxide, generally obtained from limestone), along with magnesium oxide (MgO), and aluminium oxide (Al2O3), are commonly added to improve chemical durability. Soda–lime glasses (Na2O) + lime (CaO) + magnesia (MgO) + alumina (Al2O3) account for over 75% of manufactured glass, containing about 70 to 74% silica by weight. Soda–lime–silicate glass is transparent, easily formed, and most suitable for window glass and tableware. However, it has a high thermal expansion and poor resistance to heat. Soda–lime glass is typically used for windows, bottles, light bulbs, and jars.

==== Borosilicate glass ====

Borosilicate glasses (e.g. Pyrex, Duran) typically contain 5–13% boron trioxide (B2O3). Borosilicate glasses have fairly low coefficients of thermal expansion (7740 Pyrex CTE is 3.25/°C as compared to about 9/°C for a typical soda–lime glass). They are, therefore, less subject to stress caused by thermal expansion and thus less vulnerable to cracking from thermal shock. They are commonly used for e.g. labware, household cookware, and sealed beam car head lamps.

==== Lead glass ====

The addition of lead(II) oxide into silicate glass lowers the melting point and viscosity of the melt. The high density of lead glass (silica + lead oxide (PbO) + potassium oxide (K2O) + soda (Na2O) + zinc oxide (ZnO) + alumina) results in a high electron density, and hence high refractive index, making the look of glassware more brilliant and causing noticeably more specular reflection and increased optical dispersion. Lead glass has a high elasticity, making the glassware more workable and giving rise to a clear &quot;ring&quot; sound when struck. However, lead glass cannot withstand high temperatures well. Lead oxide also facilitates the solubility of other metal oxides and is used in coloured glass. The viscosity decrease of lead glass melt is very significant (roughly 100 times in comparison with soda glass); this allows easier removal of bubbles and working at lower temperatures, hence its frequent use as an additive in vitreous enamels and glass solders. The high ionic radius of the Pb2+ ion renders it highly immobile and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than soda–lime glass (108.5 vs 106.5 Ω⋅cm, DC at 250 °C).

==== Aluminosilicate glass ====
Aluminosilicate glass typically contains 5–10% alumina (Al2O3). Aluminosilicate glass tends to be more difficult to melt and shape compared to borosilicate compositions but has excellent thermal resistance and durability. Aluminosilicate glass is extensively used for fibreglass, used for making glass-reinforced plastics (boats, fishing rods, etc.), top-of-stove cookware, and halogen bulb glass.

==== Other oxide additives ====
The addition of barium also increases the refractive index. Thorium oxide gives glass a high refractive index and low dispersion and was formerly used in producing high-quality lenses, but due to its radioactivity has been replaced by lanthanum oxide in modern eyeglasses. Iron can be incorporated into glass to absorb infrared radiation, for example in heat-absorbing filters for movie projectors, while cerium(IV) oxide can be used for glass that absorbs ultraviolet wavelengths. Fluorine lowers the dielectric constant of glass. Fluorine is highly electronegative and lowers the polarizability of the material. Fluoride silicate glasses are used in the manufacture of integrated circuits as an insulator.

==== Glass-ceramics ====
Glass-ceramic materials contain both non-crystalline glass and crystalline ceramic phases. They are formed by controlled nucleation and partial crystallisation of a base glass by heat treatment. Crystalline grains are often embedded within a non-crystalline intergranular phase of grain boundaries. Glass-ceramics exhibit advantageous thermal, chemical, biological, and dielectric properties as compared to metals or organic polymers.

The most commercially important property of glass-ceramics is their imperviousness to thermal shock. Thus, glass-ceramics have become extremely useful for countertop cooking and industrial processes. The negative thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive CTE of the glassy phase. At a certain point (~70% crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net CTE near zero. This type of glass-ceramic exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000 °C.

==== Fibreglass ====

Fibreglass (also called glass fibre reinforced plastic, GRP) is a composite material made by reinforcing a plastic resin with glass fibres. It is made by melting glass and stretching the glass into fibres. These fibres are woven together into a cloth and left to set in a plastic resin.
Fibreglass has the properties of being lightweight and corrosion resistant and is a good insulator enabling its use as building insulation material and for electronic housing for consumer products. Fibreglass was originally used in the United Kingdom and United States during World War II to manufacture radomes. Uses of fibreglass include building and construction materials, boat hulls, car body parts, and aerospace composite materials.

Glass-fibre wool is an excellent thermal and sound insulation material, commonly used in buildings (e.g. attic and cavity wall insulation), and plumbing (e.g. pipe insulation), and soundproofing. It is produced by forcing molten glass through a fine mesh by centripetal force and breaking the extruded glass fibres into short lengths using a stream of high-velocity air. The fibres are bonded with an adhesive spray and the resulting wool mat is cut and packed in rolls or panels.

=== Non-silicate glasses ===

Besides common silica-based glasses many other inorganic and organic materials may also form glasses, including metals, aluminates, phosphates, borates, chalcogenides, fluorides, germanates (glasses based on GeO2), tellurites (glasses based on TeO2), antimonates (glasses based on Sb2O3), arsenates (glasses based on As2O3), titanates (glasses based on TiO2), tantalates (glasses based on Ta2O5), nitrates, carbonates, plastics, acrylic, and many other substances. Some of these glasses (e.g. Germanium dioxide (GeO2, Germania), in many respects a structural analogue of silica, fluoride, aluminate, phosphate, borate, and chalcogenide glasses) have physicochemical properties useful for their application in fibre-optic waveguides in communication networks and other specialised technological applications.

Silica-free glasses may often have poor glass-forming tendencies. Novel techniques, including containerless processing by aerodynamic levitation (cooling the melt whilst it floats on a gas stream) or splat quenching (pressing the melt between two metal anvils or rollers), may be used to increase the cooling rate or to reduce crystal nucleation triggers.

==== Amorphous metals ====
In the past, small batches of amorphous metals with high surface area configurations (ribbons, wires, films, etc.) have been produced through the implementation of extremely rapid rates of cooling. Amorphous metal wires have been produced by sputtering molten metal onto a spinning metal disk.

Several alloys have been produced in layers with thicknesses exceeding 1 millimetre. These are known as bulk metallic glasses (BMG). Liquidmetal Technologies sells several zirconium-based BMGs.

Batches of amorphous steel have also been produced that demonstrate mechanical properties far exceeding those found in conventional steel alloys.

Experimental evidence indicates that the system Al-Fe-Si may undergo a &quot;first-order transition&quot; to an amorphous form (dubbed &quot;q-glass&quot;) on rapid cooling from the melt. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images indicate that q-glass nucleates from the melt as discrete particles with uniform spherical growth in all directions. While x-ray diffraction reveals the isotropic nature of q-glass, a nucleation barrier exists implying an interfacial discontinuity (or internal surface) between the glass and melt phases.

==== Polymers ====
Important polymer glasses include amorphous and glassy pharmaceutical compounds. These are useful because the solubility of the compound is greatly increased when it is amorphous compared to the same crystalline composition. Many emerging pharmaceuticals are practically insoluble in their crystalline forms. Many polymer thermoplastics familiar to everyday use are glasses. For many applications, like glass bottles or eyewear, polymer glasses (acrylic glass, polycarbonate or polyethylene terephthalate) are a lighter alternative to traditional glass.

=== Molecular liquids and molten salts ===
Molecular liquids, electrolytes, molten salts, and aqueous solutions are mixtures of different molecules or ions that do not form a covalent network but interact only through weak van der Waals forces or transient hydrogen bonds. In a mixture of three or more ionic species of dissimilar size and shape, crystallization can be so difficult that the liquid can easily be supercooled into a glass. Examples include LiCl:&quot;R&quot;H2O (a solution of lithium chloride salt and water molecules) in the composition range 4&lt;&quot;R&quot;&lt;8. sugar glass, or Ca0.4K0.6(NO3)1.4. Glass electrolytes in the form of Ba-doped Li-glass and Ba-doped Na-glass have been proposed as solutions to problems identified with organic liquid electrolytes used in modern lithium-ion battery cells.

== Production ==

Following the glass batch preparation and mixing, the raw materials are transported to the furnace. Soda–lime glass for mass production is melted in glass-melting furnaces. Smaller-scale furnaces for speciality glasses include electric melters, pot furnaces, and day tanks.
After melting, homogenization and refining (removal of bubbles), the glass is . This may be achieved manually by glassblowing, which involves gathering a mass of hot semi-molten glass, inflating it into a bubble using a hollow blowpipe, and forming it into the required shape by blowing, swinging, rolling, or moulding. While hot, the glass can be worked using hand tools, cut with shears, and additional parts such as handles or feet attached by welding.
Flat glass for windows and similar applications is formed by the float glass process, developed between 1953 and 1957 by Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK&#x27;s Pilkington Brothers, who created a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity. The top surface of the glass is subjected to nitrogen under pressure to obtain a polished finish. Container glass for common bottles and jars is formed by blowing and pressing methods. This glass is often slightly modified chemically (with more alumina and calcium oxide) for greater water resistance.

Once the desired form is obtained, glass is usually annealed for the removal of stresses and to increase the glass&#x27;s hardness and durability. Surface treatments, coatings or lamination may follow to improve the chemical durability (glass container coatings, glass container internal treatment), strength (toughened glass, bulletproof glass, windshields), or optical properties (insulated glazing, anti-reflective coating).

New chemical glass compositions or new treatment techniques can be initially investigated in small-scale laboratory experiments. The raw materials for laboratory-scale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because the cost factor has a low priority. In the laboratory mostly pure chemicals are used. Care must be taken that the raw materials have not reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment (such as alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides, or boron oxide), or that the impurities are quantified (loss on ignition). Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during the selection of the raw materials, e.g., sodium selenite may be preferred over easily evaporating selenium dioxide (SeO2). Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively inert ones, such as aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH)3) over alumina (Al2O3). Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material. Glass homogeneity is achieved by homogenizing the raw materials mixture (glass batch), stirring the melt, and crushing and re-melting the first melt. The obtained glass is usually annealed to prevent breakage during processing.

=== Colour ===
Colour in glass may be obtained by addition of homogenously distributed electrically charged ions (or colour centres). While ordinary soda–lime glass appears colourless in thin section, iron(II) oxide (FeO) impurities produce a green tint in thick sections. Manganese dioxide (MnO2), which gives glass a purple colour, may be added to remove the green tint given by FeO. FeO and chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3) additives are used in the production of green bottles. Iron (III) oxide, on the other-hand, produces yellow or yellow-brown glass. Low concentrations (0.025 to 0.1%) of cobalt oxide (CoO) produce rich, deep blue cobalt glass. Chromium is a very powerful colouring agent, yielding dark green.
Sulphur combined with carbon and iron salts produces amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. A glass melt can also acquire an amber colour from a reducing combustion atmosphere. Cadmium sulfide produces imperial red, and combined with selenium can produce shades of yellow, orange, and red. Addition of copper(II) oxide (CuO) produces a turquoise colour in glass, in contrast to copper(I) oxide (Cu2O) which gives a dull red-brown colour.


== Uses ==
=== Architecture and windows ===

Soda–lime sheet glass is typically used as a transparent glazing material, typically as windows in external walls of buildings. Float or rolled sheet glass products are cut to size either by scoring and snapping the material, laser cutting, water jets, or diamond-bladed saw. The glass may be thermally or chemically tempered (strengthened) for safety and bent or curved during heating. Surface coatings may be added for specific functions such as scratch resistance, blocking specific wavelengths of light (e.g. infrared or ultraviolet), dirt-repellence (e.g. self-cleaning glass), or switchable electrochromic coatings.

Structural glazing systems represent one of the most significant architectural innovations of modern times, where glass buildings now often dominate the skylines of many modern cities. These systems use stainless steel fittings countersunk into recesses in the corners of the glass panels allowing strengthened panes to appear unsupported creating a flush exterior. Structural glazing systems have their roots in iron and glass conservatories of the nineteenth century

=== Tableware ===

Glass is an essential component of tableware and is typically used for water, beer and wine drinking glasses. Wine glasses are typically stemware, i.e. goblets formed from a bowl, stem, and foot. Crystal or Lead crystal glass may be cut and polished to produce decorative drinking glasses with gleaming facets. Other uses of glass in tableware include decanters, jugs, plates, and bowls.
=== Packaging ===

The inert and impermeable nature of glass makes it a stable and widely used material for food and drink packaging as glass bottles and jars. Most container glass is soda–lime glass, produced by blowing and pressing techniques. Container glass has a lower magnesium oxide and sodium oxide content than flat glass, and a higher silica, calcium oxide, and aluminium oxide content. Its higher content of water-insoluble oxides imparts slightly higher chemical durability against water, which is advantageous for storing beverages and food. Glass packaging is sustainable, readily recycled, reusable and refillable.

For electronics applications, glass can be used as a substrate in the manufacture of integrated passive devices, thin-film bulk acoustic resonators, and as a hermetic sealing material in device packaging, including very thin solely glass based encapsulation of integrated circuits and other semiconductors in high manufacturing volumes.

=== Laboratories ===

Glass is an important material in scientific laboratories for the manufacture of experimental apparatus because it is relatively cheap, readily formed into required shapes for experiment, easy to keep clean, can withstand heat and cold treatment, is generally non-reactive with many reagents, and its transparency allows for the observation of chemical reactions and processes. Laboratory glassware applications include flasks, Petri dishes, test tubes, pipettes, graduated cylinders, glass-lined metallic containers for chemical processing, fractionation columns, glass pipes, Schlenk lines, gauges, and thermometers. Although most standard laboratory glassware has been mass-produced since the 1920s, scientists still employ skilled glassblowers to manufacture bespoke glass apparatus for their experimental requirements.
=== Optics ===
Glass is a ubiquitous material in optics because of its ability to refract, reflect, and transmit light. These and other optical properties can be controlled by varying chemical compositions, thermal treatment, and manufacturing techniques. The many applications of glass in optics include glasses for eyesight correction, imaging optics (e.g. lenses and mirrors in telescopes, microscopes, and cameras), fibre optics in telecommunications technology, and integrated optics. Microlenses and gradient-index optics (where the refractive index is non-uniform) find application in e.g. reading optical discs, laser printers, photocopiers, and laser diodes.

=== Modern Art ===

The 19th century saw a revival in ancient glassmaking techniques including cameo glass, achieved for the first time since the Roman Empire, initially mostly for pieces in a neo-classical style. The Art Nouveau movement made great use of glass, with René Lalique, Émile Gallé, and Daum of Nancy in the first French wave of the movement, producing coloured vases and similar pieces, often in cameo glass or lustre glass techniques.

Louis Comfort Tiffany in America specialised in stained glass, both secular and religious, in panels and his famous lamps. The early 20th century saw the large-scale factory production of glass art by firms such as Waterford and Lalique. Small studios may hand-produce glass artworks. Techniques for producing glass art include blowing, kiln-casting, fusing, slumping, pâte de verre, flame-working, hot-sculpting and cold-working. Cold work includes traditional stained glass work and other methods of shaping glass at room temperature. Objects made out of glass include vessels, paperweights, marbles, beads, sculptures and installation art.

<text>Gel electrophoresis is an electrophoresis method for separation and analysis of biomacromolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, etc.) and their fragments, based on their size and charge through a gel. It is used in clinical chemistry to separate proteins by charge or size (IEF agarose, essentially size independent) and in biochemistry and molecular biology to separate a mixed population of DNA and RNA fragments by length, to estimate the size of DNA and RNA fragments, or to separate proteins by charge.

Nucleic acid molecules are separated by applying an electric field to move the negatively charged molecules through a gel matrix of agarose, polyacrylamide, or other substances. Shorter molecules move faster and migrate farther than longer ones because shorter molecules migrate more easily through the pores of the gel. This phenomenon is called sieving. Proteins are separated by the charge in agarose because the pores of the gel are too large to sieve proteins. Gel electrophoresis can also be used for the separation of nanoparticles.

Gel electrophoresis uses a gel as an anticonvective medium or sieving medium during electrophoresis. Gels suppress the thermal convection caused by the application of the electric field and can also serve to maintain the finished separation so that a post-electrophoresis stain can be applied. DNA gel electrophoresis is usually performed for analytical purposes, often after amplification of DNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but may be used as a preparative technique for other methods such as mass spectrometry, RFLP, PCR, cloning, DNA sequencing, or southern blotting for further characterization.

==Physical basis==
Electrophoresis is a process that enables the sorting of molecules based on charge, size, or shape. Using an electric field, molecules such as DNA can be made to move through a gel made of agarose or polyacrylamide. The electric field consists of a negative charge at one end which pushes the molecules through the gel and a positive charge at the other end that pulls the molecules through the gel. The molecules being sorted are dispensed into a well in the gel material. The gel is placed in an electrophoresis chamber, which is then connected to a power source. When the electric field is applied, the larger molecules move more slowly through the gel while the smaller molecules move faster. The different sized molecules form distinct bands on the gel.

The term &quot;gel&quot; in this instance refers to the matrix used to contain, then separate the target molecules. In most cases, the gel is a crosslinked polymer whose composition and porosity are chosen based on the specific weight and composition of the target to be analyzed. When separating proteins or small nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotides), the gel is usually composed of different concentrations of acrylamide and a cross-linker, producing different sized mesh networks of polyacrylamide. When separating larger nucleic acids (greater than a few hundred bases), the preferred matrix is purified agarose. In both cases, the gel forms a solid yet porous matrix. Acrylamide, in contrast to polyacrylamide, is a neurotoxin and must be handled using appropriate safety precautions to avoid poisoning. Agarose is composed of long unbranched chains of uncharged carbohydrates without cross-links, resulting in a gel with large pores allowing for the separation of macromolecules and macromolecular complexes.

Electrophoresis refers to the electromotive force (EMF) that is used to move the molecules through the gel matrix. By placing the molecules in wells in the gel and applying an electric field, the molecules will move through the matrix at different rates, determined largely by their mass when the charge-to-mass ratio (Z) of all species is uniform. However, when charges are not uniform, the electrical field generated by the electrophoresis procedure will cause the molecules to migrate differentially according to charge. Species that are net positively charged will migrate towards the cathode (which is negatively charged because this is an electrolytic rather than galvanic cell), whereas species that are net negatively charged will migrate towards the positively charged anode. Mass remains a factor in the speed with which these non-uniformly charged molecules migrate through the matrix toward their respective electrodes.

If several samples have been loaded into adjacent wells in the gel, they will run parallel in individual lanes. Depending on the number of different molecules, each lane shows the separation of the components from the original mixture as one or more distinct bands, one band per component. Incomplete separation of the components can lead to overlapping bands, or indistinguishable smears representing multiple unresolved components. Bands in different lanes that end up at the same distance from the top contain molecules that passed through the gel at the same speed, which usually means they are approximately the same size. There are molecular weight size markers available that contain a mixture of molecules of known sizes. If such a marker was run on one lane in the gel parallel to the unknown samples, the bands observed can be compared to those of the unknown to determine their size. The distance a band travels is approximately inversely proportional to the logarithm of the size of the molecule. (Equivalently, the distance traveled is inversely proportional to the log of the samples&#x27;s molecular weight).

There are limits to electrophoretic techniques. Since passing a current through a gel causes heating, gels may melt during electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is performed in buffer solutions to reduce pH changes due to the electric field, which is important because the charge of DNA and RNA depends on pH, but running for too long can exhaust the buffering capacity of the solution. There are also limitations in determining the molecular weight by SDS-PAGE, especially when trying to find the MW of an unknown protein. Certain biological variables are difficult or impossible to minimize and can affect electrophoretic migration. Such factors include protein structure, post-translational modifications, and amino acid composition. For example, tropomyosin is an acidic protein that migrates abnormally on SDS-PAGE gels. This is because the acidic residues are repelled by the negatively charged SDS, leading to an inaccurate mass-to-charge ratio and migration. Further, different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other, for morphological or other reasons.

==Types of gel==

The types of gel most typically used are agarose and polyacrylamide gels. Each type of gel is well-suited to different types and sizes of the analyte. Polyacrylamide gels are usually used for proteins and have very high resolving power for small fragments of DNA (5-500 bp). Agarose gels, on the other hand, have lower resolving power for DNA but a greater range of separation, and are therefore usually used for DNA fragments of 50–20,000 bp in size. (The resolution of over 6 Mb is possible with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).) Polyacrylamide gels are run in a vertical configuration while agarose gels are typically run horizontally in a submarine mode. They also differ in their casting methodology, as agarose sets thermally, while polyacrylamide forms in a chemical polymerization reaction.

===Agarose===

Agarose gels are made from the natural polysaccharide polymers extracted from seaweed.
Agarose gels are easily cast and handled compared to other matrices because the gel setting is a physical rather than chemical change. Samples are also easily recovered. After the experiment is finished, the resulting gel can be stored in a plastic bag in a refrigerator.

Agarose gels do not have a uniform pore size, but are optimal for electrophoresis of proteins that are larger than 200 kDa. Agarose gel electrophoresis can also be used for the separation of DNA fragments ranging from 50 base pair to several megabases (millions of bases), the largest of which require specialized apparatus. The distance between DNA bands of different lengths is influenced by the percent agarose in the gel, with higher percentages requiring longer run times, sometimes days. Instead high percentage agarose gels should be run with a pulsed field electrophoresis (PFE), or field inversion electrophoresis.

&quot;Most agarose gels are made with between 0.7% (good separation or resolution of large 5–10kb DNA fragments) and 2% (good resolution for small 0.2–1kb fragments) agarose dissolved in electrophoresis buffer. Up to 3% can be used for separating very tiny fragments but a vertical polyacrylamide gel is more appropriate in this case. Low percentage gels are very weak and may break when you try to lift them. High percentage gels are often brittle and do not set evenly. 1% gels are common for many applications.&quot;

===Polyacrylamide===
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) is used for separating proteins ranging in size from 5 to 2,000 kDa due to the uniform pore size provided by the polyacrylamide gel. Pore size is controlled by modulating the concentrations of acrylamide and bis-acrylamide powder used in creating a gel. Care must be used when creating this type of gel, as acrylamide is a potent neurotoxin in its liquid and powdered forms.

Traditional DNA sequencing techniques such as Maxam-Gilbert or Sanger methods used polyacrylamide gels to separate DNA fragments differing by a single base-pair in length so the sequence could be read. Most modern DNA separation methods now use agarose gels, except for particularly small DNA fragments. It is currently most often used in the field of immunology and protein analysis, often used to separate different proteins or isoforms of the same protein into separate bands. These can be transferred onto a nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane to be probed with antibodies and corresponding markers, such as in a western blot.

Typically resolving gels are made in 6%, 8%, 10%, 12% or 15%. Stacking gel (5%) is poured on top of the resolving gel and a gel comb (which forms the wells and defines the lanes where proteins, sample buffer, and ladders will be placed) is inserted. The percentage chosen depends on the size of the protein that one wishes to identify or probe in the sample. The smaller the known weight, the higher the percentage that should be used. Changes in the buffer system of the gel can help to further resolve proteins of very small sizes.

===Starch===

Partially hydrolysed potato starch makes for another non-toxic medium for protein electrophoresis. The gels are slightly more opaque than acrylamide or agarose. Non-denatured proteins can be separated according to charge and size. They are visualised using Napthal Black or Amido Black staining. Typical starch gel concentrations are 5% to 10%.

==Gel conditions==

===Denaturing===
Denaturing gels are run under conditions that disrupt the natural structure of the analyte, causing it to unfold into a linear chain. Thus, the mobility of each macromolecule depends only on its linear length and its mass-to-charge ratio. Thus, the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary levels of biomolecular structure are disrupted, leaving only the primary structure to be analyzed.

Nucleic acids are often denatured by including urea in the buffer, while proteins are denatured using sodium dodecyl sulfate, usually as part of the SDS-PAGE process. For full denaturation of proteins, it is also necessary to reduce the covalent disulfide bonds that stabilize their tertiary and quaternary structure, a method called reducing PAGE. Reducing conditions are usually maintained by the addition of beta-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol. For a general analysis of protein samples, reducing PAGE is the most common form of protein electrophoresis.

Denaturing conditions are necessary for proper estimation of molecular weight of RNA. RNA is able to form more intramolecular interactions than DNA which may result in change of its electrophoretic mobility. Urea, DMSO and glyoxal are the most often used denaturing agents to disrupt RNA structure. Originally, highly toxic methylmercury hydroxide was often used in denaturing RNA electrophoresis, but it may be method of choice for some samples.

Denaturing gel electrophoresis is used in the DNA and RNA banding pattern-based methods temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).

===Native===

Native gels are run in non-denaturing conditions so that the analyte&#x27;s natural structure is maintained. This allows the physical size of the folded or assembled complex to affect the mobility, allowing for analysis of all four levels of the biomolecular structure. For biological samples, detergents are used only to the extent that they are necessary to lyse lipid membranes in the cell. Complexes remain—for the most part—associated and folded as they would be in the cell. One downside, however, is that complexes may not separate cleanly or predictably, as it is difficult to predict how the molecule&#x27;s shape and size will affect its mobility. Addressing and solving this problem is a major aim of preparative native PAGE.

Unlike denaturing methods, native gel electrophoresis does not use a charged denaturing agent. The molecules being separated (usually proteins or nucleic acids) therefore differ not only in molecular mass and intrinsic charge, but also the cross-sectional area, and thus experience different electrophoretic forces dependent on the shape of the overall structure. For proteins, since they remain in the native state they may be visualized not only by general protein staining reagents but also by specific enzyme-linked staining.

A specific experiment example of an application of native gel electrophoresis is to check for enzymatic activity to verify the presence of the enzyme in the sample during protein purification. For example, for the protein alkaline phosphatase, the staining solution is a mixture of 4-chloro-2-2methylbenzenediazonium salt with 3-phospho-2-naphthoic acid-2&#x27;-4&#x27;-dimethyl aniline in Tris buffer. This stain is commercially sold as a kit for staining gels. If the protein is present, the mechanism of the reaction takes place in the following order: it starts with the de-phosphorylation of 3-phospho-2-naphthoic acid-2&#x27;-4&#x27;-dimethyl aniline by alkaline phosphatase (water is needed for the reaction). The phosphate group is released and replaced by an alcohol group from water. The electrophile 4- chloro-2-2 methylbenzenediazonium (Fast Red TR Diazonium salt) displaces the alcohol group forming the final product Red Azo dye. As its name implies, this is the final visible-red product of the reaction. In undergraduate academic experimentation of protein purification, the gel is usually run next to commercial purified samples to visualize the results and conclude whether or not purification was successful.

Native gel electrophoresis is typically used in proteomics and metallomics. However, native PAGE is also used to scan genes (DNA) for unknown mutations as in single-strand conformation polymorphism.

==Buffers==
Buffers in gel electrophoresis are used to provide ions that carry a current and to maintain the pH at a relatively constant value.
These buffers have plenty of ions in them, which is necessary for the passage of electricity through them. Something like distilled water or benzene contains few ions, which is not ideal for the use in electrophoresis. There are a number of buffers used for electrophoresis. The most common being, for nucleic acids Tris/Acetate/EDTA (TAE), Tris/Borate/EDTA (TBE). Many other buffers have been proposed, e.g. lithium borate, which is rarely used, based on Pubmed citations (LB), isoelectric histidine, pK matched goods buffers, etc.; in most cases the purported rationale is lower current (less heat) matched ion mobilities, which leads to longer buffer life. Borate is problematic; Borate can polymerize, or interact with cis diols such as those found in RNA. TAE has the lowest buffering capacity but provides the best resolution for larger DNA. This means a lower voltage and more time, but a better product. LB is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp; However, with its low conductivity, a much higher voltage could be used (up to 35 V/cm), which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis. As low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3% agarose gel with an extremely low conductivity medium (1 mM Lithium borate).

Most SDS-PAGE protein separations are performed using a &quot;discontinuous&quot; (or DISC) buffer system that significantly enhances the sharpness of the bands within the gel. During electrophoresis in a discontinuous gel system, an ion gradient is formed in the early stage of electrophoresis that causes all of the proteins to focus on a single sharp band in a process called isotachophoresis. Separation of the proteins by size is achieved in the lower, &quot;resolving&quot; region of the gel. The resolving gel typically has a much smaller pore size, which leads to a sieving effect that now determines the electrophoretic mobility of the proteins.

==Visualization==
After the electrophoresis is complete, the molecules in the gel can be stained to make them visible. DNA may be visualized using ethidium bromide which, when intercalated into DNA, fluoresce under ultraviolet light, while protein may be visualised using silver stain or Coomassie brilliant blue dye. Other methods may also be used to visualize the separation of the mixture&#x27;s components on the gel. If the molecules to be separated contain radioactivity, for example in a DNA sequencing gel, an autoradiogram can be recorded of the gel. Photographs can be taken of gels, often using a Gel Doc system. Gels are then commonly labelled for presentation and scientific records on the popular figure-creation website, SciUGo.

==Downstream processing==

After separation, an additional separation method may then be used, such as isoelectric focusing or SDS-PAGE. The gel will then be physically cut, and the protein complexes extracted from each portion separately. Each extract may then be analysed, such as by peptide mass fingerprinting or de novo peptide sequencing after in-gel digestion. This can provide a great deal of information about the identities of the proteins in a complex.

==Applications==
*Estimation of the size of DNA molecules following restriction enzyme digestion, e.g. in restriction mapping of cloned DNA.
*Analysis of PCR products, e.g. in molecular genetic diagnosis or genetic fingerprinting
*Separation of restricted genomic DNA prior to Southern transfer, or of RNA prior to Northern transfer.

Gel electrophoresis is used in forensics, molecular biology, genetics, microbiology and biochemistry. The results can be analyzed quantitatively by visualizing the gel with UV light and a gel imaging device. The image is recorded with a computer-operated camera, and the intensity of the band or spot of interest is measured and compared against standard or markers loaded on the same gel. The measurement and analysis are mostly done with specialized software.

Depending on the type of analysis being performed, other techniques are often implemented in conjunction with the results of gel electrophoresis, providing a wide range of field-specific applications.

===Nucleic acids===


In the case of nucleic acids, the direction of migration, from negative to positive electrodes, is due to the naturally occurring negative charge carried by their sugar-phosphate backbone.

Double-stranded DNA fragments naturally behave as long rods, so their migration through the gel is relative to their size or, for cyclic fragments, their radius of gyration. Circular DNA such as plasmids, however, may show multiple bands, the speed of migration may depend on whether it is relaxed or supercoiled. Single-stranded DNA or RNA tends to fold up into molecules with complex shapes and migrate through the gel in a complicated manner based on their tertiary structure. Therefore, agents that disrupt the hydrogen bonds, such as sodium hydroxide or formamide, are used to denature the nucleic acids and cause them to behave as long rods again.

Gel electrophoresis of large DNA or RNA is usually done by agarose gel electrophoresis. See the &quot;chain termination method&quot; page for an example of a polyacrylamide DNA sequencing gel. Characterization through ligand interaction of nucleic acids or fragments may be performed by mobility shift affinity electrophoresis.

Electrophoresis of RNA samples can be used to check for genomic DNA contamination and also for RNA degradation. RNA from eukaryotic organisms shows distinct bands of 28s and 18s rRNA, the 28s band being approximately twice as intense as the 18s band. Degraded RNA has less sharply defined bands, has a smeared appearance, and the intensity ratio is less than 2:1.

===Proteins===

Proteins, unlike nucleic acids, can have varying charges and complex shapes, therefore they may not migrate into the polyacrylamide gel at similar rates, or all when placing a negative to positive EMF on the sample. Proteins, therefore, are usually denatured in the presence of a detergent such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) that coats the proteins with a negative charge. Generally, the amount of SDS bound is relative to the size of the protein (usually 1.4g SDS per gram of protein), so that the resulting denatured proteins have an overall negative charge, and all the proteins have a similar charge-to-mass ratio. Since denatured proteins act like long rods instead of having a complex tertiary shape, the rate at which the resulting SDS coated proteins migrate in the gel is relative only to their size and not their charge or shape.

Proteins are usually analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), by native gel electrophoresis, by preparative native gel electrophoresis (QPNC-PAGE), or by 2-D electrophoresis.

Characterization through ligand interaction may be performed by electroblotting or by affinity electrophoresis in agarose or by capillary electrophoresis as for estimation of binding constants and determination of structural features like glycan content through lectin binding.

===Nanoparticles===

A novel application for gel electrophoresis is the separation or characterization of metal or metal oxide nanoparticles (e.g. Au, Ag, ZnO, SiO2) regarding the size, shape, or surface chemistry of the nanoparticles. The scope is to obtain a more homogeneous sample (e.g. narrower particle size distribution), which then can be used in further products/processes (e.g. self-assembly processes). For the separation of nanoparticles within a gel, the key parameter is the ratio of the particle size to the mesh size, whereby two migration mechanisms were identified: the unrestricted mechanism, where the particle size « mesh size, and the restricted mechanism, where particle size is similar to mesh size.

A 1959 book on electrophoresis by Milan Bier cites references from the 1800s. However, Oliver Smithies made significant contributions. Bier states: &quot;The method of Smithies ... is finding wide application because of its unique separatory power.&quot; Taken in context, Bier clearly implies that Smithies&#x27; method is an improvement.

<doc id="12583" wikidata="Q47778" url="?curid=12583" title="Gary Lineker">
<text>Gary Winston Lineker ( ; born 30 November 1960) is an English sports broadcaster and former professional footballer who played as a striker. Lineker is the only player to have been the top goalscorer in England with three clubs: Leicester City, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur. He also played for Barcelona in Spain, and won 80 caps for England. His media career began with the BBC, where he has presented the flagship football programme &quot;Match of the Day&quot; since the late 1990s, the longest tenure of any MOTD presenter. Lineker is also the BBC&#x27;s lead presenter for live football matches, including coverage of international tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup. He has also worked for Al Jazeera Sports, Eredivisie Live, NBC Sports Network, and BT Sport&#x27;s coverage of the UEFA Champions League.

Lineker began his football career at Leicester City in 1978, and finished as the First Division&#x27;s joint top goalscorer in 1984–85. He then moved to league champions Everton, where he won both the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards in his debut season, before moving to Spanish club Barcelona, where he won the 1987–88 Copa del Rey and the 1989 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. He joined Tottenham Hotspur in 1989, and won his second FWA Footballer of the Year and the FA Cup, his first and only major trophy in English football. Lineker&#x27;s final club was Nagoya Grampus Eight; he retired in 1994 after two seasons at the Japanese side.

Lineker made his England debut in 1984, earning 80 caps and scoring 48 goals over an eight-year international career, which made him England&#x27;s second-highest goalscorer on his retirement. He remains England&#x27;s fourth-highest scorer, behind Harry Kane, Wayne Rooney and Bobby Charlton, and his goals-to-games ratio remains one of the best for the country. His six goals in the 1986 World Cup made him the tournament&#x27;s top scorer, receiving the Golden Boot, and he came second in the 1986 Ballon d&#x27;Or. Lineker was again integral to England&#x27;s progress to the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup, scoring another four goals. He still holds England&#x27;s record for goals in the World Cup.

Lineker never received a yellow or red card during his career, and he also never won a top-flight league title. He was honoured in 1990 with the FIFA Fair Play Award. In a senior career which spanned 16 years and 654 competitive games, Lineker scored a total of 331 goals, including 283 goals at club level. After his retirement from football he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame. A keen supporter of Leicester City, he led a consortium in 2002 that invested in his old club, saving it from bankruptcy, and was appointed honorary vice-president.

==Early life==
Gary Winston Lineker was born on 30 November 1960 in Leicester, the son of Margaret P. (Abbs) and Barry Lineker. He was given his middle name in honour of Winston Churchill, with whom he shares a birthday. He has one brother, Wayne, who is two years his junior. Lineker grew up with his family in the city, playing football with Wayne. Their father was a greengrocer, as were their grandfather William and great-grandfather George, in Leicester. Barry Lineker ran Lineker&#x27;s fruit and veg stall in Leicester Market, and as a child and a young player Gary regularly helped out on the stall. Lineker, who is white, received racial abuse as a child for his dark features.

Lineker first attended Caldecote Road School (Caldecote Juniors), Braunstone in Leicester (east of the Meridian Centre). He then went to the City of Leicester Boys&#x27; Grammar School (now City of Leicester College) on Downing Drive in Evington, owing to his preference for football rather than rugby, which was the main sport of most schools near his home. Lineker was equally talented at both football and cricket. From the ages of 11 to 16 he captained the Leicestershire Schools cricket team, and had felt that he had a higher chance of succeeding at it rather than football. He later stated on &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot; that as a teenager he idolised former England captain David Gower, who was playing for Leicestershire at the time. During his youth he played for Aylestone Park Youth, later becoming the club&#x27;s president.

Lineker left school with four O Levels. One of his teachers wrote on his report card that he &quot;concentrates too much on football&quot; and that he would &quot;never make a living at that&quot;. He then joined the youth academy at Leicester City in 1976.

==Club career==
===Leicester City===
Lineker began his career at his hometown club Leicester City after leaving school in 1977, turning professional in the 1978–79 season and making his senior debut on New Year&#x27;s Day 1979 in a 2–0 win at Filbert Street over Oldham Athletic in the Second Division. He earned a Second Division title medal a year later with 19 appearances, but played just nine league games in 1980–81 as Leicester went straight back down.

Lineker became a regular player in 1981–82, scoring 19 goals in all competitions that season. Although Leicester missed out on promotion, they reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, and clinched promotion a year later as Lineker scored 26 times in the Second Division. In 1983–84, he enjoyed regular First Division action for the first time and was the division&#x27;s second-highest scorer with 22 goals, although Leicester failed to finish anywhere near the top of the league. He was the First Division&#x27;s joint top scorer in 1984–85 with 24 goals, and was enjoying a prolific partnership with Alan Smith. By this stage he was attracting the attention of bigger clubs, and a move from Filbert Street was looking certain.

===Everton===
In the 1985 close season, defending league champions Everton signed Lineker for £800,000; he scored 40 goals in 57 games for his new team in the 1985–86 season. Lineker&#x27;s first game for Everton happened to be away to Leicester City; at half time, he walked into the Leicester dressing room by mistake. He was again the First Division&#x27;s leading goalscorer, this time with 30 goals (including three hat-tricks), and helped Everton finish second in the league. While at Everton, they reached the FA Cup final for the third consecutive year but lost 3–1 to Liverpool, despite Lineker giving them an early lead when he outpaced Alan Hansen to score. Liverpool had also pipped Everton to the title by just two points. &quot;I was only on Merseyside a short time, nine or 10 months in total really, but it was still a happy time personally, while professionally it was one of the most successful periods of my career&quot;, he says. &quot;I still have an affinity towards Everton.&quot;

Lineker scored three hat-tricks for Everton; at home to Birmingham City in a 4–1 league win on 31 August 1985, at home to Manchester City in a 4–0 win on 11 February 1986, and then in the penultimate league game of the season on 3 May 1986, when they kept their title hopes alive with a 6–1 home win over Southampton. On his final league appearance, he scored twice in a 3–1 home win over West Ham United whose own title hopes had just disappeared. Lineker and his colleagues were denied title glory as Liverpool also won their final league game of the season at Chelsea. Lineker has said since retiring from football that this Everton team was the best club side he ever played in.

===Barcelona===
After winning the Golden Boot at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, Lineker was signed by Barcelona for £2.8 million. Barcelona were being managed by former Queens Park Rangers manager Terry Venables, who had also brought in Manchester United and Wales striker Mark Hughes. Barcelona gave Lineker his first chance of European football, as Leicester had never qualified for Europe while he played for them, and Everton were denied a place in the European Cup for 1985–86 due to the ban on English clubs in European competitions following the Heysel disaster.

Lineker&#x27;s Golden Boot-winning performance at the World Cup generated much anticipation of success at the Camp Nou, and he scored 21 goals in 41 games during his first season, including a hat-trick in a 3–2 win over archrivals Real Madrid. He made his Barcelona debut against Racing Santander, scoring twice. Barcelona went on to win the Copa del Rey in 1988 and the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1989. Lineker played in Barcelona&#x27;s shock home and away defeats to Dundee United. Barcelona manager Johan Cruyff decided to play Lineker on the right of the midfield and he was eventually no longer an automatic choice in the team.

With 42 goals in 103 La Liga appearances, Lineker became the highest scoring British player in the competition&#x27;s history, but was later surpassed by Gareth Bale in March 2016.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson attempted to sign Lineker to partner his ex-Barcelona teammate Mark Hughes in attack, but Lineker instead signed for Tottenham Hotspur in July 1989 for £1.1 million. Over three seasons, he scored 67 goals in 105 league games and won the FA Cup while playing for the club. He finished as top scorer in the First Division in the 1989–90 season, scoring 24 goals as Spurs finished third.

Lineker finally collected an English trophy when he won the 1991 FA Cup Final with Spurs, who beat Nottingham Forest 2–1. This was despite Lineker having a goal controversially disallowed for offside and also having a penalty saved by goalkeeper Mark Crossley. Lineker had contributed to Tottenham&#x27;s run to the final. In the semi-final he scored twice in a 3–1 win over North London rivals Arsenal.

Lineker was the top division&#x27;s second-highest goalscorer in 1991–92 with 28 goals from 35 games, behind Ian Wright, who scored 29 times in 42 games. Despite Lineker&#x27;s personal performance, Tottenham finished this final pre-Premier League season in 15th place. His last goal in English football came on the last day of the season in a 3–1 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford.

===Nagoya Grampus Eight===
In November 1991, Lineker accepted an offer of a two-year contract from J1 League club Nagoya Grampus Eight. The transfer fee paid to Tottenham Hotspur was £2 million. He officially joined Nagoya Grampus Eight after playing his final game for Spurs on 2 May 1992, when he scored the consolation goal in a 3–1 defeat by Manchester United on the last day of the season. Shortly before accepting the offer from Nagoya Grampus Eight, Tottenham had rejected an offer from ambitious Second Division club Blackburn Rovers, who had recently been taken over by steel baron Jack Walker.

Having scored 9 goals in 23 appearances over two injury impacted seasons for Nagoya Grampus Eight, he announced his retirement from playing in September 1994. The English national media had previously reported that he would be returning to England to complete his playing career at Middlesbrough or Southampton.

==International career==
Lineker was capped once by the England B national team, playing in a 2–0 home win over New Zealand&#x27;s B team on 13 November 1984. He first played for the full England team against Scotland in 1984. He played five games in the 1986 World Cup and was top scorer of the tournament with six goals, winning the Golden Boot, making him the first English player to have done so. He scored the second quickest hat-trick ever at a FIFA World Cup tournament against Poland, the second English player to score a hat-trick at a World Cup, and scored two goals against Paraguay in the second round. He played most of the tournament wearing a lightweight cast on his forearm. He scored for England in the World Cup quarter-final against Argentina, but the game ended in defeat as Diego Maradona scored twice for the opposition (the first goal being the &quot;Hand of God&quot; handball, and the second being the &quot;Goal of the Century&quot;). In 1988, Lineker played in Euro 88, but failed to score as England lost all three Group games. It was later established that he had been suffering from hepatitis.

In the 1990 World Cup, he scored four goals to help England reach the semi-finals. He was unwell during the tournament, and accidentally defecated in his shorts during the opening group game against the Republic of Ireland. After Andreas Brehme sent England 1–0 down in the semi-final, Lineker received a pass from Paul Parker and escaped two West German defenders on his way to scoring the equaliser, but the West Germans triumphed in the penalty shoot-out and went on to win the trophy. Later he said: &quot;Football is a simple game; 22 men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans win.&quot; Lineker&#x27;s equaliser appears in the popular England national team anthem, &quot;Three Lions&quot;, with the lyric &quot;When Lineker scored&quot;.

He retired from international football with eighty caps and forty-eight goals, one fewer goal than Sir Bobby Charlton&#x27;s England record (which Charlton accrued over 106 caps). In what proved to be his last England match, against Sweden at Euro 92, he was substituted by England coach Graham Taylor in favour of Arsenal striker Alan Smith, ultimately denying him the chance to equal—or even better—Charlton&#x27;s record. He had earlier missed a penalty that would have brought him level, in a pre-tournament friendly against Brazil. He was visibly upset at the decision, not looking at Taylor as he took the bench.

He scored four goals in an England match on two occasions and is one of very few players never to have been given a yellow card or a red card in any type of game.

==Media career==
=== Sports presenting ===
Following retirement from professional football, Lineker developed a career in the media, initially on the BBC for Radio 5 Live and as a football pundit. He appeared as a team captain on the sports game show &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot; from 1995 to 2003. He also presented &quot;Grandstand&quot; in the London studio while then-presenter Desmond Lynam was in Aintree when the Grand National was abandoned because of a bomb alert at the racecourse in 1997. In 1999, he replaced Lynam as the BBC&#x27;s anchorman for football coverage, including its flagship football television programme &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, becoming BBC Sport&#x27;s highest paid presenter. Following the departure of Steve Rider from the BBC in 2005, Lineker, who is a keen recreational golfer with a handicap of four, became the new presenter for the corporation&#x27;s golf coverage. Despite receiving some criticism from his peers, he continued to front the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the Masters and The Open.

In 2005, Lineker was sued for defamation by Australian footballer Harry Kewell over comments Lineker had made writing in his column in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; about Kewell&#x27;s transfer from Leeds United to Liverpool. However, the jury was unable to reach a verdict. It became known during the case that the article had actually been ghost-written by a journalist at &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; following a telephone interview with Lineker.

In May 2010, Lineker resigned from his role as columnist for &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; in protest over the sting operation against Lord Triesman that reportedly jeopardised England&#x27;s bid to host the 2018 World Cup. Triesman resigned as chairman of the bid and the FA on 16 May 2010 after the publication of a secret recording of a conversation between the peer and a former ministerial aide, during which he claimed that Spain and Russia were planning to bribe referees at the World Cup in South Africa. Lineker then began working as an anchor for the English language football coverage for Al Jazeera Sport, which is broadcast throughout most of the Middle East. He left the Qatar-based network in 2012.

In 2013, Lineker began working for NBCSN as part of their Premier League coverage and contributing to the US version of &quot;Match of the Day&quot;. On 9 June 2015, Lineker was unveiled as the lead presenter of BT Sport&#x27;s Champions League coverage. On 13 August 2016, Lineker presented the first &quot;Match of the Day&quot; of the 2016–17 season wearing only boxer shorts. Believing it would simply not happen, he had promised in a tweet from December 2015 that if Leicester City won the Premier League, he would &quot;present Match of the Day in just my undies&quot;.

As of July 2022, Lineker is the highest-paid BBC presenter and has been for several years; receiving payments of £1.75–1.76 million each year between 2016 and 2020, and approximately £1.35 million in 2020–21. His pay has been criticised by Julian Knight, chair of the parliamentary Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, and Dame Esther Rantzen. The BBC&#x27;s Director General, Tim Davie, stated that Lineker&#x27;s pay was justified &quot;because of the value of analysis to the viewing audience&quot;.

In March 2023, Lineker was required to step back from presenting on the BBC for three days due to a controversy over his criticism of the British government&#x27;s immigration policy on Twitter.

On 11 November 2024, Lineker who was hosting Match of the Day since 1999 announced that he would be stepping down from presenting the program, following the conclusion of the 2024–25 Premier League season in May 2025. He will also leave the BBC after covering the 2026 FIFA World Cup which will take place in Canada, the United States and Mexico and the 2025–26 FA Cup.

=== Walkers commercials ===
Lineker has appeared in television commercials for the Leicester-based snack company Walkers. Originally signing a £200,000 deal in 1994, his first advert was 1995&#x27;s &quot;Welcome Home&quot; (Lineker had recently returned to England having played in Japan). Walkers temporarily named their salt and vinegar crisps after Lineker, labelling them &#x27;Salt &amp; Lineker&#x27;, in the late 1990s. In 2000, Lineker&#x27;s Walkers commercials were ranked ninth in Channel 4&#x27;s poll of &quot;The 100 Greatest TV Ads&quot;.

=== Other media appearances ===
Lineker participated in Prince Edward&#x27;s charity television special &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot; in 1987. He also appeared in the 1991 play &quot;An Evening with Gary Lineker&quot; by Arthur Smith and Chris England, which was adapted for television in 1994. He presented a six-part TV series for the BBC in 1998 (directed by Lloyd Stanton) called &quot;Golden Boots&quot;, with other football celebrities. It was an extensive history of the World Cup focusing on the &#x27;Golden Boots&#x27; (top scorers).

In 2006, Lineker took on an acting role as the voice of &quot;Underground Ernie&quot; on the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s channel, CBeebies. In December 2008, Lineker appeared on the ITV1 television programme &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; where he and English rugby union player Austin Healey won £50,000 for the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation. In 2009, Lineker and his wife Danielle hosted a series of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, following on from Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen from the previous year in visiting and showcasing locations throughout Northern Ireland.

Lineker has made a number of cameo appearances in TV shows and movies, such as the 2002 film &quot;Bend It Like Beckham,&quot; the 2014 BBC TV film &quot;Marvellous&quot;, and a number of appearances in the Apple TV+ football comedy TV series &quot;Ted Lasso&quot;. In 2013, Lineker participated in the genealogical programme &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; during which he discovered an ancestor who was a poacher, and another who was a legal clerk. In 2021, Lineker started hosting the ITV game show &quot;Sitting on a Fortune&quot;.

===Goalhanger Films and Podcasts===
In May 2014, Lineker established his own production company Goalhanger Films Ltd. with former ITV Controller Tony Pastor. During the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Lineker presented several short videos produced by Goalhanger Films on YouTube with the title &quot;Blahzil&quot;. In May 2015, the company produced a 60-minute-long documentary presented by Lineker titled &quot;Gary Lineker on the Road to FA Cup Glory&quot; for the BBC.

He also operates Goalhanger Podcasts, which produces &quot;Leading&quot;, &quot;The Rest is History&quot;, &quot;The Rest is Politics&quot; and his own podcast, &quot;The Rest is Football&quot;, which he hosts with Alan Shearer and Micah Richards.

==Personal life==
Lineker married Michelle Cockayne in 1986. In May 2006, Cockayne filed for divorce on the grounds of her husband&#x27;s alleged &quot;unreasonable behaviour&quot;, with documents submitted to the court claiming that Lineker&#x27;s actions in their marriage had caused her &quot;stress and anxiety&quot;. Lineker and she have four sons. The couple subsequently stated that the situation was amicable.

In November 1991, Lineker&#x27;s eldest son survived a rare form of leukaemia whilst he was a baby, and was treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. Lineker now supports children&#x27;s cancer charity CLIC Sargent and has appeared in promotional clips encouraging people to give blood. Lineker has been actively involved with other cancer charities such as Leukaemia Busters, where between 1994 and 2005 Gary and Michelle were the charity&#x27;s patrons. He has also been involved with the Fight for Life and Cancer Research UK charities.

Lineker was made a freeman of the City of Leicester in 1995 and he has been referred to as &quot;Leicester&#x27;s favourite son&quot;.

In October 2002, Lineker backed a £5 million bid to rescue his former club Leicester City, which had recently gone into administration, describing his involvement as &quot;charity&quot; rather than an &quot;ego trip&quot;. He stated that he would invest a six-figure sum and that other members of his consortium would invest a similar amount. Lineker met with fans&#x27; groups to persuade them to try and raise money to rescue his former club. The club was eventually saved from liquidation. He is now honorary Vice President of Leicester City F.C.

Lineker married Danielle Bux on 2 September 2009, in Ravello, Italy. On 13 January 2016, Lineker and Bux announced they were divorcing, after six years of marriage, the reason given being Gary not wanting more children.

In 1985, Lineker was best man at snooker player Willie Thorne&#x27;s wedding and their close friendship was the subject of the VHS production, &quot;Best of Friends – The Official Story of Gary Lineker &amp; Willie Thorne&quot;.

In November 2017, Lineker was named in the Paradise Papers in connection with a tax avoidance scheme relating to property owned in Barbados and a company set up in the British Virgin Islands.

Lineker speaks Spanish, which he learnt during his time playing for FC Barcelona, and is an advocate for the teaching of foreign languages in schools.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Lineker announced that he was donating £140,000 to the British Red Cross towards research into the virus.

On 28 March 2023 he won an appeal against HM Revenue and Customs over a bill that totalled £4.9 million. The authority had pursued him over taxes on income from BBC and BT Sport from 2013–14 to 2017–18 on the grounds he was an employee of both organisations at the time. A judge ruled he was a freelancer and had contracts with both broadcasters.

===Political views===
Lineker has been noted for political views which he shares on Twitter. In December 2016, he was described by Angus Harrison of Vice News as &quot;the British Left&#x27;s Loudest Voice&quot; for being &quot;both staunchly liberal and resolutely unafraid of making his views known&quot;. Using a football analogy, Lineker defined his ideological position as &quot;I make more runs to the left than the right, but never felt comfortable on the wing&quot;. After the 2017 United Kingdom general election, in which Theresa May led the Conservatives and Jeremy Corbyn led Labour, Lineker wrote &quot;Anyone else feel politically homeless? Everything seems far right or way left. Something sensibly centrist might appeal?&quot;

Lineker endorsed a Remain vote in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. In July 2018, he announced his support for People&#x27;s Vote, a campaign group calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union.

On 18 October 2016, Lineker tweeted a rebuttal to a statement made by MP David Davies where Davies suggested refugees entering the UK should undergo dental checks to verify their age: &quot;The treatment by some towards these young refugees is hideously racist and utterly heartless. What&#x27;s happening to our country?&quot; This led &quot;The Sun&quot; to call for Lineker&#x27;s sacking from &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, accusing him of breaching BBC impartiality guidelines.

In December 2018, Lineker was criticised by the BBC&#x27;s cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew for expressing his political views on Twitter. Agnew said, &quot;You are the face of BBC Sport. Please observe BBC editorial guidelines and keep your political views, whatever they are and whatever the subject, to yourself. I&#x27;d be sacked if I followed your example.&quot; A BBC spokesperson said, &quot;Gary is not involved in any news or political output for the BBC and as such, any expression of his personal political views does not affect the BBC&#x27;s impartiality.&quot;

In October 2022, a complaint about a tweet from Lineker that referred to donations to the Conservative Party was upheld by the BBC, on the grounds that it breached social media use guidelines and failed to meet editorial standards of impartiality. During the 2022 World Cup, Qatari lawyer Hassan Al-Thawadi criticised Lineker for covering human rights violations in Qatar by stating that he did not talk about such issues with other host countries. In response, Lineker countered on &quot;The News Agents&quot; podcast that he covered issues in other host countries, and characterised the United States, one of the countries co-hosting the 2026 World Cup, as an &quot;extraordinarily racist country&quot;. His statements on the United States were criticised by Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan in January 2023, who said they were &quot;very derogatory questionable comments&quot;.

==== 2023 controversy and suspension from &quot;Match of the Day&quot; ====

In March 2023, Lineker criticised the British government&#x27;s asylum policy via Twitter. Commenting on a video message by the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, about stopping migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats, he said the message was &quot;beyond awful&quot; and called the government&#x27;s policy &quot;an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s&quot;. The comments received condemnation from some Conservative politicians, including Braverman herself, and a spokesperson for Labour leader Keir Starmer said comparisons with 1930s Germany &quot;aren&#x27;t always the best way&quot; to make an argument. Lineker received support from other political figures, including Baron Dubs, Alastair Campbell, and Angela Rayner. A BBC source said the corporation was taking the matter &quot;seriously&quot; and expected to have a &quot;frank conversation&quot; with Lineker. The BBC&#x27;s culture and media editor Katie Razzall wrote, &quot;As the UK&#x27;s most scrutinised media organisation in increasingly polarised times, to say Gary Lineker&#x27;s recent tweets cause difficulty for the BBC is an understatement.&quot; Lineker said he stood by his comments and did not fear suspension from his BBC work.

On 10 March, the BBC said Lineker would step back from his job on &quot;Match of the Day&quot; because it considered &quot;his recent social media activity to be a breach of our guidelines&quot;. It added it had &quot;decided Lineker will not present &quot;Match of the Day&quot; until there&#x27;s an agreed and clear position on his use of social media&quot;. Lineker&#x27;s BBC Sport colleagues Ian Wright, Alan Shearer, Steve Wilson, Conor McNamara, Robyn Cowen, Steven Wyeth, Alex Scott, Jason Mohammad, Mark Chapman, Jermaine Jenas, Dion Dublin and Jermain Defoe all pulled out of their respective roles in BBC programmes in the next hours in solidarity with him. As a result, the broadcaster was forced to reduce its sports-related schedules for 11 and 12 March, with &quot;Match of the Day&quot; going ahead without any hosts or studio presentation, thus featuring only match footage. It also affected the BBC World Service&#x27;s English-language programme &quot;Sportsworld&quot;, which was not aired on that day and was instead replaced with alternative programming. The BBC and Lineker issued coordinated statements on 13 March. Lineker&#x27;s suspension was ended and the BBC announced it would initiate an independent review of its social media guidelines and how they apply to freelancers outside news. The BBC&#x27;s director-general, Tim Davie, stated that Lineker had agreed to abide by the corporation&#x27;s editorial guidelines until the review into them has been completed.

Since the controversy, Lineker has continued to use Twitter to comment on political issues. On 21 November 2023, he tweeted: &quot;Worth 13 minutes of anyone&#x27;s time.&quot; The tweet was accompanied by a link to an interview between Owen Jones and Raz Segal, in which Segal stated that Israel&#x27;s actions in the Israel–Hamas war were &quot;a textbook case of genocide&quot;. Lineker&#x27;s tweet was interpreted by some to be an endorsement of Segal&#x27;s views. 

In December 2023, Lineker signed an open letter criticising the government&#x27;s proposal to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps, Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, and Jonathan Gullis accused him of violating impartiality and lodged a complaint with the BBC.

==Career statistics==

===International===


Lineker earned his first cap for England in 1984 against Scotland during the 1983–84 British Home Championship. He played his last game for England in a 2–1 loss against Sweden in a Euro 1992 group stage match. He almost equalled the England goalscoring record, held at the time by Bobby Charlton, in a pre-tournament friendly against Brazil, but he missed a penalty kick, leaving him one goal short of Charlton&#x27;s total, which was overtaken by Wayne Rooney in 2015.

<doc id="12584" wikidata="Q83181" url="?curid=12584" title="Golgi apparatus">
<text>The Golgi apparatus (), also known as the Golgi complex, Golgi body, or simply the Golgi, is an organelle found in most eukaryotic cells. Part of the endomembrane system in the cytoplasm, it packages proteins into membrane-bound vesicles inside the cell before the vesicles are sent to their destination. It resides at the intersection of the secretory, lysosomal, and endocytic pathways. It is of particular importance in processing proteins for secretion, containing a set of glycosylation enzymes that attach various sugar monomers to proteins as the proteins move through the apparatus.

The Golgi apparatus was identified in 1898 by the Italian biologist and pathologist Camillo Golgi. The organelle was later named after him in the 1910s.

== Discovery ==
Because of its large size and distinctive structure, the Golgi apparatus was one of the first organelles to be discovered and observed in detail. It was discovered in 1898 by Italian physician Camillo Golgi during an investigation of the nervous system. After first observing it under his microscope, he termed the structure as &quot;apparato reticolare interno&quot; (&quot;internal reticular apparatus&quot;). Some doubted the discovery at first, arguing that the appearance of the structure was merely an optical illusion created by Golgi’s observation technique. With the development of modern microscopes in the twentieth century, the discovery was confirmed. Early references to the Golgi apparatus referred to it by various names, including the Golgi–Holmgren apparatus, Golgi–Holmgren ducts, and Golgi–Kopsch apparatus. The term Golgi apparatus was used in 1910 and first appeared in scientific literature in 1913, while &quot;Golgi complex&quot; was introduced in 1956.

== Subcellular localization ==

The subcellular localization of the Golgi apparatus varies among eukaryotes. In mammals, a single Golgi apparatus is usually located near the cell nucleus, close to the centrosome. Tubular connections are responsible for linking the stacks together. Localization and tubular connections of the Golgi apparatus are dependent on microtubules. In experiments it is seen that as microtubules are depolymerized the Golgi apparatuses lose mutual connections and become individual stacks throughout the cytoplasm. In yeast, multiple Golgi apparatuses are scattered throughout the cytoplasm (as observed in &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;). In plants, Golgi stacks are not concentrated at the centrosomal region and do not form Golgi ribbons. Organization of the plant Golgi depends on actin cables and not microtubules. The common feature among Golgi is that they are adjacent to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites.

== Structure ==
In most eukaryotes, the Golgi apparatus is made up of a series of compartments and is a collection of fused, flattened membrane-enclosed disks known as cisternae (singular: &quot;cisterna&quot;, also called &quot;dictyosomes&quot;), originating from vesicular clusters that bud off the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A mammalian cell typically contains 40 to 100 stacks of cisternae. Between four and eight cisternae are usually present in a stack; however, in some protists as many as sixty cisternae have been observed. This collection of cisternae is broken down into &quot;cis&quot;, medial, and &quot;trans&quot; compartments, making up two main networks: the cis Golgi network (CGN) and the trans Golgi network (TGN). The CGN is the first cisternal structure, and the TGN is the final, from which proteins are packaged into vesicles destined to lysosomes, secretory vesicles, or the cell surface. The TGN is usually positioned adjacent to the stack, but can also be separate from it. The TGN may act as an early endosome in yeast and plants.

There are structural and organizational differences in the Golgi apparatus among eukaryotes. In some yeasts, Golgi stacking is not observed. &quot;Pichia pastoris&quot; does have stacked Golgi, while &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; does not. In plants, the individual stacks of the Golgi apparatus seem to operate independently.

The Golgi apparatus tends to be larger and more numerous in cells that synthesize and secrete large amounts of substances; for example, the antibody-secreting plasma B cells of the immune system have prominent Golgi complexes.

In all eukaryotes, each cisternal stack has a &quot;cis&quot; entry face and a &quot;trans&quot; exit face. These faces are characterized by unique morphology and biochemistry. Within individual stacks are assortments of enzymes responsible for selectively modifying protein cargo. These modifications influence the fate of the protein. The compartmentalization of the Golgi apparatus is advantageous for separating enzymes, thereby maintaining consecutive and selective processing steps: enzymes catalyzing early modifications are gathered in the &quot;cis&quot; face cisternae, and enzymes catalyzing later modifications are found in &quot;trans&quot; face cisternae of the Golgi stacks.

== Function ==

The Golgi apparatus is a major collection and dispatch station of protein products received from the endoplasmic reticulum. Proteins synthesized in the ER are packaged into vesicles, which then fuse with the Golgi apparatus. These cargo proteins are modified and destined for secretion via exocytosis or for use in the cell. 
In this respect, the Golgi can be thought of as similar to a post office: it packages and labels items which it then sends to different parts of the cell or to the extracellular space. The Golgi apparatus is also involved in lipid transport and lysosome formation.

The structure and function of the Golgi apparatus are intimately linked. Individual stacks have different assortments of enzymes, allowing for progressive processing of cargo proteins as they travel from the cisternae to the trans Golgi face. Enzymatic reactions within the Golgi stacks occur exclusively near its membrane surfaces, where enzymes are anchored. This feature is in contrast to the ER, which has soluble proteins and enzymes in its lumen. Much of the enzymatic processing is post-translational modification of proteins. For example, phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on lysosomal proteins occurs in the early CGN. &quot;Cis&quot; cisterna are associated with the removal of mannose residues. Removal of mannose residues and addition of N-acetylglucosamine occur in medial cisternae. Addition of galactose and sialic acid occurs in the &quot;trans&quot; cisternae. Sulfation of tyrosines and carbohydrates occurs within the TGN. Other general post-translational modifications of proteins include the addition of carbohydrates (glycosylation) and phosphates (phosphorylation). Protein modifications may form a signal sequence that determines the final destination of the protein. For example, the Golgi apparatus adds a mannose-6-phosphate label to proteins destined for lysosomes. Another important function of the Golgi apparatus is in the formation of proteoglycans. Enzymes in the Golgi append proteins to glycosaminoglycans, thus creating proteoglycans. Glycosaminoglycans are long unbranched polysaccharide molecules present in the extracellular matrix of animals.

== Vesicular transport ==
The vesicles that leave the rough endoplasmic reticulum are transported to the &quot;cis&quot; face of the Golgi apparatus, where they fuse with the Golgi membrane and empty their contents into the lumen. Once inside the lumen, the molecules are modified, then sorted for transport to their next destinations.

Those proteins destined for areas of the cell other than either the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus are moved through the Golgi cisternae towards the &quot;trans&quot; face, to a complex network of membranes and associated vesicles known as the &quot;trans-Golgi network&quot; (TGN). This area of the Golgi is the point at which proteins are sorted and shipped to their intended destinations by their placement into one of at least three different types of vesicles, depending upon the signal sequence they carry.

== Current models of vesicular transport and trafficking ==

=== Model 1: Anterograde vesicular transport between stable compartments ===
* In this model, the Golgi is viewed as a set of stable compartments that work together. Each compartment has a unique collection of enzymes that work to modify protein cargo. Proteins are delivered from the ER to the &quot;cis&quot; face using COPII-coated vesicles. Cargo then progress toward the &quot;trans&quot; face in COPI-coated vesicles. This model proposes that COPI vesicles move in two directions: anterograde vesicles carry secretory proteins, while retrograde vesicles recycle Golgi-specific trafficking proteins.
** Strengths: The model explains observations of compartments, polarized distribution of enzymes, and waves of moving vesicles. It also attempts to explain how Golgi-specific enzymes are recycled.
** Weaknesses: Since the amount of COPI vesicles varies drastically among types of cells, this model cannot easily explain high trafficking activity within the Golgi for both small and large cargoes. Additionally, there is no convincing evidence that COPI vesicles move in both the anterograde and retrograde directions.
* This model was widely accepted from the early 1980s until the late 1990s.

===Model 2: Cisternal progression/maturation===
* In this model, the fusion of COPII vesicles from the ER begins the formation of the first &quot;cis&quot;-cisterna of the Golgi stack, which progresses later to become mature TGN cisternae. Once matured, the TGN cisternae dissolve to become secretory vesicles. While this progression occurs, COPI vesicles continually recycle Golgi-specific proteins by delivery from older to younger cisternae. Different recycling patterns may account for the differing biochemistry throughout the Golgi stack. Thus, the compartments within the Golgi are seen as discrete kinetic stages of the maturing Golgi apparatus.
** Strengths: The model addresses the existence of Golgi compartments, as well as differing biochemistry within the cisternae, transport of large proteins, transient formation and disintegration of the cisternae, and retrograde mobility of native Golgi proteins, and it can account for the variability seen in the structures of the Golgi.
** Weaknesses: This model cannot easily explain the observation of fused Golgi networks, tubular connections among cisternae, and differing kinetics of secretory cargo exit.

===Model 3: Cisternal progression/maturation with heterotypic tubular transport===
* This model is an extension of the cisternal progression/maturation model. It incorporates the existence of tubular connections among the cisternae that form the Golgi ribbon, in which cisternae within a stack are linked. This model posits that the tubules are important for bidirectional traffic in the ER-Golgi system: they allow for fast anterograde traffic of small cargo and/or the retrograde traffic of native Golgi proteins.
** Strengths: This model encompasses the strengths of the cisternal progression/maturation model that also explains rapid trafficking of cargo, and how native Golgi proteins can recycle independently of COPI vesicles.
** Weaknesses: This model cannot explain the transport kinetics of large protein cargo, such as collagen. Additionally, tubular connections are not prevalent in plant cells. The roles that these connections have can be attributed to a cell-specific specialization rather than a universal trait. If the membranes are continuous, that suggests the existence of mechanisms that preserve the unique biochemical gradients observed throughout the Golgi apparatus.

===Model 4: Rapid partitioning in a mixed Golgi===
* This rapid partitioning model is the most drastic alteration of the traditional vesicular trafficking point of view. Proponents of this model hypothesize that the Golgi works as a single unit, containing domains that function separately in the processing and export of protein cargo. Cargo from the ER move between these two domains, and randomly exit from any level of the Golgi to their final location. This model is supported by the observation that cargo exits the Golgi in a pattern best described by exponential kinetics. The existence of domains is supported by fluorescence microscopy data.
** Strengths: Notably, this model explains the exponential kinetics of cargo exit of both large and small proteins, whereas other models cannot.
** Weaknesses: This model cannot explain the transport kinetics of large protein cargo, such as collagen. This model falls short on explaining the observation of discrete compartments and polarized biochemistry of the Golgi cisternae. It also does not explain formation and disintegration of the Golgi network, nor the role of COPI vesicles.

===Model 5: Stable compartments as cisternal model progenitors===
* This is the most recent model. In this model, the Golgi is seen as a collection of stable compartments defined by Rab (G-protein) GTPases.
** Strengths: This model is consistent with numerous observations and encompasses some of the strengths of the cisternal progression/maturation model. Additionally, what is known of the Rab GTPase roles in mammalian endosomes can help predict putative roles within the Golgi. This model is unique in that it can explain the observation of &quot;megavesicle&quot; transport intermediates.
** Weaknesses: This model does not explain morphological variations in the Golgi apparatus, nor define a role for COPI vesicles. This model does not apply well for plants, algae, and fungi in which individual Golgi stacks are observed (transfer of domains between stacks is not likely). Additionally, megavesicles are not established to be intra-Golgi transporters.

Though there are multiple models that attempt to explain vesicular traffic throughout the Golgi, no individual model can independently explain all observations of the Golgi apparatus. Currently, the cisternal progression/maturation model is the most accepted among scientists, accommodating many observations across eukaryotes. The other models are still important in framing questions and guiding future experimentation. Among the fundamental unanswered questions are the directionality of COPI vesicles and role of Rab GTPases in modulating protein cargo traffic.

== Brefeldin A ==
Brefeldin A (BFA) is a fungal metabolite used experimentally to disrupt the secretion pathway as a method of testing Golgi function. BFA blocks the activation of some ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs). ARFs are small GTPases which regulate vesicular trafficking through the binding of COPs to endosomes and the Golgi. BFA inhibits the function of several guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that mediate GTP-binding of ARFs. Treatment of cells with BFA thus disrupts the secretion pathway, promoting disassembly of the Golgi apparatus and distributing Golgi proteins to the endosomes and ER.

<text>Grace Brewster Hopper (; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist, mathematician, and United States Navy rear admiral. She was a pioneer of computer programming. Hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages, and used this theory to develop the FLOW-MATIC programming language and COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today. She was also one of the first programmers on the Harvard Mark I computer. She is credited with writing the first computer manual, &quot;A Manual of Operation for the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator.&quot;

Before joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in both mathematics and mathematical physics from Yale University and was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College. She left her position at Vassar to join the United States Navy Reserve during World War II. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 as a member of the Harvard Mark I team, led by Howard H. Aiken. In 1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer. At Eckert–Mauchly she managed the development of one of the first COBOL compilers.

She believed that programming should be simplified with an English-based computer programming language. Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper had finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was written for the A-0 System. In 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, helping to create a machine-independent programming language called COBOL, which was based on English words. Hopper promoted the use of the language throughout the 60s.

The U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 &quot;Hopper&quot; supercomputer at NERSC, and the Nvidia GPU architecture &quot;Hopper&quot;. During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world. A college at Yale University was renamed in her honor. In 1991, she received the National Medal of Technology. On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama. In 2024, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) dedicated a marker in honor of Grace Hopper at the University of Pennsylvania for her role in inventing the A-0 compiler during her time as a Lecturer in the School of Engineering, citing her inspirational impact on young engineers.

== Early life and education ==
Grace Brewster Murray was born in New York City. She was the eldest of three children. Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne, were of Scottish and Dutch descent, and attended West End Collegiate Church. Her great-grandfather, Alexander Wilson Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War.

Grace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock). Later in life, she was known for keeping a clock that ran backward, she explained, &quot;Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, &#x27;We&#x27;ve always done it this way.&#x27; I try to fight that. That&#x27;s why I have a clock on my wall that runs counterclockwise.&quot; For her preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey. Grace was initially rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (because her test scores in Latin were too low), but she was admitted the next year. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master&#x27;s degree at Yale University in 1930.

In 1930, Grace Murray married New York University professor Vincent Foster Hopper (1906–1976); they divorced in 1945. She did not marry again and retained his surname.

In 1934, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale under the direction of Øystein Ore. Her dissertation, &quot;New Types of Irreducibility Criteria&quot;, was published that same year. She began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate professor in 1941.

== Career ==
=== World War II ===

Hopper tried to be commissioned in the Navy early in World War II, however she was turned down. At age 34, she was too old to enlist and her weight-to-height ratio was too low. She was also denied on the basis that her job as a mathematician and mathematics professor at Vassar College was valuable to the war effort. During the war in 1943, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve; she was one of many women who volunteered to serve in the WAVES.

She had to get an exemption to be commissioned; she was below the Navy minimum weight of . She reported in December and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen&#x27;s School at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade. She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by Howard H. Aiken.

Hopper and Aiken co-authored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. Hopper&#x27;s request to transfer to the regular Navy at the end of the war was declined due to her advanced age of 38. She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve. Hopper remained at the Harvard Computation Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship at Vassar in favor of working as a research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard.

=== UNIVAC ===
In 1949, Hopper became an employee of the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation as a senior mathematician and joined the team developing the UNIVAC I. Hopper also served as UNIVAC director of Automatic Programming Development for Remington Rand. The UNIVAC was the first known large-scale electronic computer to be on the market in 1951, and was more competitive at processing information than the Mark I.

When Hopper recommended the development of a new programming language that would use entirely English words, she &quot;was told very quickly that [she] couldn&#x27;t do this because computers didn&#x27;t understand English.&quot; Still, she persisted. &quot;It&#x27;s much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols&quot;, she explained. &quot;So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code.&quot;

Her idea was not accepted for three years. In the meantime, she published her first paper on the subject, compilers, in 1952. In the early 1950s, the company was taken over by the Remington Rand corporation, and it was while she was working for them that her original compiler work was done. The program was known as the A compiler and its first version was A-0.

In 1952, she had an operational link-loader, which at the time was referred to as a compiler. She later said that &quot;Nobody believed that&quot;, and that she &quot;had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic.&quot;

In 1954 Hopper was named the company&#x27;s first director of automatic programming. Beginning in 1954, Hopper&#x27;s work was influenced by the Laning and Zierler system, which was the first compiler to accept algebraic notation as input. Her department released some of the first compiler-based programming languages, including MATH-MATIC and FLOW-MATIC.

Hopper said that her compiler A-0, &quot;translated mathematical notation into machine code. Manipulating symbols was fine for mathematicians but it was no good for data processors who were not symbol manipulators. Very few people are really symbol manipulators. If they are, they become professional mathematicians, not data processors. It&#x27;s much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. I could say &#x27;Subtract income tax from pay&#x27; instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols. COBOL is the major language used today in data processing.&quot;

=== COBOL ===

In the spring of 1959, computer experts from industry and government were brought together in a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL). Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language COBOL (an acronym for COmmon Business-Oriented Language). The new language extended Hopper&#x27;s FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the IBM equivalent, COMTRAN. Hopper&#x27;s belief that programs should be written in a language that was close to English (rather than in machine code or in languages close to machine code, such as assembly languages) was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date. Among the members of the committee that worked on COBOL was Mount Holyoke College alumna Jean E. Sammet.

From 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the Navy&#x27;s Office of Information Systems Planning and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1973. She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy.

=== Standards ===
In the 1970s, Hopper advocated for the Defense Department to replace large, centralized systems with networks of small, distributed computers. Any user on any computer node could access common databases on the network. She developed the implementation of standards for testing computer systems and components, most significantly for early programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL. The Navy tests for conformance to these standards led to significant convergence among the programming language dialects of the major computer vendors. In the 1980s, these tests (and their official administration) were assumed by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), known today as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

== Retirement ==

In accordance with Navy attrition regulations, Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve with the rank of commander at age 60 at the end of 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlAttrition/Retirement&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She was recalled to active duty in August 1967 for a six-month period that turned into an indefinite assignment. She again retired in 1971 but was again asked to return to active duty in 1972. She was promoted to captain in 1973 by Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr.

After Republican Representative Philip Crane saw her on a March 1983 segment of &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, he championed a joint resolution to promote Hopper to commodore on the retired list; the resolution was referred to, but not reported out of, the Senate Armed Services Committee. Hopper was instead promoted to commodore on December 15, 1983, via the Appointments Clause by President Ronald Reagan. She remained on active duty for several years beyond mandatory retirement by special approval of Congress. Effective November 8, 1985, the rank of commodore was renamed rear admiral (lower half) and Hopper became one of the Navy&#x27;s few female admirals.

After a career that spanned more than 42 years, Hopper retired from the Navy on August 14, 1986. At the time, she was the oldest serving member of the Navy. At a celebration held in Boston on the to commemorate her retirement, Hopper was awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the highest non-combat decoration awarded by the Department of Defense.

At the time of her retirement, she was the oldest active-duty commissioned officer in the United States Navy (79 years, eight months and five days), and had her retirement ceremony aboard the oldest commissioned ship in the United States Navy (188 years, 9 months, 23 days).

== Post-retirement ==
After her retirement from the Navy, Hopper was hired as a senior consultant to Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Hopper was initially offered a position by Rita Yavinsky, but she insisted on going through the typical formal interview process. She then proposed in jest that she would be willing to accept a position which made her available on alternating Thursdays, exhibited at their museum of computing as a pioneer, in exchange for a generous salary and unlimited expense account. Instead, she was hired as a full-time Principal Corporate Consulting Engineer, a tech-track SVP-equivalent. In this position, Hopper represented the company at industry forums, serving on various industry committees, along with other obligations. She retained that position until her death at age 85 in 1992.

At DEC Hopper served primarily as a goodwill ambassador. She lectured widely about the early days of computing, her career, and on efforts that computer vendors could take to make life easier for their users. She visited most of Digital&#x27;s engineering facilities, where she generally received a standing ovation at the conclusion of her remarks. Although no longer a serving officer, she always wore her Navy full dress uniform to these lectures contrary to U.S. Department of Defense policy. In 2016 Hopper received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honor, in recognition of her remarkable contributions to the field of computer science.

&quot;The most important thing I&#x27;ve accomplished, other than building the compiler&quot;, she said, &quot;is training young people. They come to me, you know, and say, &#x27;Do you think we can do this?&#x27; I say, &#x27;Try it.&#x27; And I back &#x27;em up. They need that. I keep track of them as they get older and I stir &#x27;em up at intervals so they don&#x27;t forget to take chances.&quot;

== Anecdotes ==

Throughout much of her later career, Hopper was much in demand as a speaker at various computer-related events. She was well known for her lively and irreverent speaking style, as well as a rich treasury of early war stories. She also received the nickname &quot;Grandma COBOL&quot;.

While Hopper was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University in 1947, her associates discovered a moth that was stuck in a relay and impeding the operation of the computer. Upon extraction, the insect was affixed to a log sheet for that day with the notation, &quot;First actual case of bug being found&quot;. While neither she nor her crew members mentioned the exact phrase, &quot;debugging&quot;, in their log entries, the case is held as a historical instance of &quot;debugging&quot; a computer and Hopper is credited with popularizing the term in computing. For many decades, the term &quot;bug&quot; for a malfunction had been in use in several fields before being applied to computers. The remains of the moth can be found taped into the group&#x27;s log book at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.

Hopper became known for her &quot;nanoseconds&quot; visual aid. People (such as generals and admirals) used to ask her why satellite communication took so long. She started handing out pieces of wire that were just under one foot long——the distance that light travels in one nanosecond. She gave these pieces of wire the metonym &quot;nanoseconds&quot;. She was careful to tell her audience that the length of her nanoseconds was actually the maximum distance the signals would travel in a vacuum in a nanosecond, and that signals would travel more slowly through the actual wires that were her teaching aids. Later she used the same pieces of wire to illustrate why computers had to be small to be fast. At many of her talks and visits, she handed out &quot;nanoseconds&quot; to everyone in the audience, contrasting them with a coil of wire long, representing a microsecond. Later, while giving these lectures while working for DEC, she passed out packets of pepper, calling the individual grains of ground pepper picoseconds.

Jay Elliot described Hopper as appearing to be &quot;&#x27;all Navy&#x27;, but when you reach inside, you find a &#x27;Pirate&#x27; dying to be released&quot;.

==Death==
On New Year&#x27;s Day 1992, Hopper died in her sleep of natural causes at her home in Arlington County, Virginia; she was 85 years of age. She was interred with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>The GNU Manifesto is a call-to-action by Richard Stallman encouraging participation and support of the GNU Project&#x27;s goal in developing the GNU free computer operating system. The GNU Manifesto was published in March 1985 in &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal of Software Tools&quot;. It is held in high regard within the free software movement as a fundamental philosophical source.

The full text is included with GNU software such as Emacs, and is publicly available.

== Background ==
Some parts of the &quot;GNU Manifesto&quot; began as an announcement of the GNU Project posted by Richard Stallman on September 27, 1983, in form of an email on Usenet newsgroups. The project&#x27;s aim was to give computer users freedom and control over their computers by collaboratively developing and providing software that is based on Stallman&#x27;s idea of software freedom (although the written definition had not existed until February 1986). The manifesto was written as a way to familiarize more people with these concepts, and to find more support in form of work, money, programs and hardware.

The &quot;GNU Manifesto&quot; possessed its name and full written form in 1985 but was updated in minor ways in 1987.

==Summary==
The &quot;GNU Manifesto&quot; opens with an explanation of what the GNU Project is, and what is the current, at the time, progress in creation of the GNU operating system. The system, although based on, and compatible with Unix, is meant by the author to have many improvements over it, which are listed in detail in the manifesto.

One of the major driving points behind the GNU project, according to Stallman, was the rapid (at the time) trend toward Unix and its various components becoming proprietary (i.e. closed-source and non-libre) software.

The manifesto lays a philosophical basis for launching the project, and importance of bringing it to fruition — proprietary software is a way to divide users, who are no longer able to help each other. Stallman refuses to write proprietary software as a sign of solidarity with them.

The author provides many reasons for why the project and software freedom is beneficial to users, although he agrees that its wide adoption will make the work of programmers less profitable.

A large part of the &quot;GNU Manifesto&quot; is focused on rebutting possible objections to GNU Project&#x27;s goals. They include the programmer&#x27;s need to make a living, the issue of advertising and distributing free software, and the perceived need of a profit incentive.

==Inspired by GNU Manifesto==
Throughout history, the &quot;GNU Manifesto&quot; has inspired various other UNIX-related manifestos. Based on it, 10 years later, a popular magazine Linux Focus released its manifesto. 20 years later, a popular illustrations publisher has published their Linux developer manifesto.

<text>Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the total market value of all the final goods and services produced and rendered in a specific time period by a country or countries. GDP is often used to measure the economic performance of a country or region. Several national and international economic organizations maintain definitions of GDP, such as the OECD and the International Monetary Fund.

The ratio of GDP to the total population of the region is the GDP per capita and can approximate a concept of a standard of living. Nominal GDP does not reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries; therefore, using a basis of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) may be more useful when comparing living standards between nations, while nominal GDP is more useful comparing national economies on the international market. Total GDP can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy.

GDP is often used as a metric for international comparisons as well as a broad measure of economic progress. It is often considered to be the world&#x27;s most powerful statistical indicator of national development and progress. However, critics of the growth imperative often argue that GDP measures were never intended to measure progress, and leave out key other externalities, such as resource extraction, environmental impact and unpaid domestic work. Alternative economic indicators such as doughnut economics use other measures, such as the Human Development Index or Better Life Index, as better approaches to measuring the effect of the economy on human development and well being.

== History ==

William Petty came up with a concept of GDP, to calculate the tax burden, and argue landlords were unfairly taxed during warfare between the Dutch and the English between 1652 and 1674. Charles Davenant developed the method further in 1695.

The modern concept of GDP was first developed by Simon Kuznets for a 1934 U.S. Congress report, where he warned against its use as a measure of welfare (see below under &quot;limitations and criticisms&quot;). After the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, GDP became the main tool for measuring a country&#x27;s economy. At that time gross national product (GNP) was the preferred estimate, which differed from GDP in that it measured production by a country&#x27;s citizens at home and abroad rather than its &quot;resident institutional units&quot; (see OECD definition above). The switch from GNP to GDP in the United States occurred in 1991. The role that measurements of GDP played in World War II was crucial to the subsequent political acceptance of GDP values as indicators of national development and progress. A crucial role was played here by the U.S. Department of Commerce under Milton Gilbert where ideas from Kuznets were embedded into institutions.

The history of the concept of GDP should be distinguished from the history of changes in many ways of estimating it. The value added by firms is relatively easy to calculate from their accounts, but the value added by the public sector, by financial industries, and by intangible asset creation is more complex. These activities are increasingly important in developed economies, and the international conventions governing their estimation and their inclusion or exclusion in GDP regularly change in an attempt to keep up with industrial advances. In the words of one academic economist, &quot;The actual number for GDP is, therefore, the product of a vast patchwork of statistics and a complicated set of processes carried out on the raw data to fit them to the conceptual framework.&quot;

China officially adopted GDP in 1993 as its indicator of economic performance. Previously, China had relied on a Marxist-inspired national accounting system.

== Determining gross domestic product (GDP) ==
GDP can be determined in three ways, all of which should, theoretically, give the same result. They are the production (or output or value added) approach, the income approach, and the speculated expenditure approach. It is representative of the total output and income within an economy.

The most direct of the three is the production approach, which sums the outputs of every class of enterprise to arrive at the total. The expenditure approach works on the principle that all of the products must be bought by somebody, therefore the value of the total product must be equal to people&#x27;s total expenditures in buying things. The income approach works on the principle that the incomes of the productive factors (&quot;producers&quot;, colloquially) must be equal to the value of their product, and determines GDP by finding the sum of all producers&#x27; incomes.

=== Production approach ===
Also known as the Value Added Approach, it calculates how much value is contributed at each stage of production.

This approach mirrors the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) definition given above.
# Estimate the gross value of domestic output out of the many various economic activities;
# Determine the intermediate consumption, i.e., the cost of material, supplies and services used to produce final goods or services.
# Deduct intermediate consumption from gross value to obtain the gross value added.

Gross value added = gross value of output – value of intermediate consumption.

Value of output = value of the total sales of goods and services plus the value of changes in the inventory.

The sum of the gross value added in the various economic activities is known as &quot;GDP at factor cost&quot;.

GDP at factor cost plus indirect taxes less subsidies on products = &quot;GDP at producer price&quot;.

For measuring the output of domestic product, economic activities (i.e. industries) are classified into various sectors. After classifying economic activities, the output of each sector is calculated by any of the following two methods:
# By multiplying the output of each sector by their respective market price and adding them together
# By collecting data on gross sales and inventories from the records of companies and adding them together

The value of output of all sectors is then added to get the gross value of output at factor cost. Subtracting each sector&#x27;s intermediate consumption from gross output value gives the GVA (=GDP) at factor cost. Adding indirect tax minus subsidies to GVA (GDP) at factor cost gives the &quot;GVA (GDP) at producer prices&quot;.

=== Income approach ===

The second way of estimating GDP is to use &quot;the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units&quot;.

If GDP is calculated this way it is sometimes called gross domestic income (GDI), or GDP (I). GDI should provide the same amount as the expenditure method described later. By definition, GDI is equal to GDP. In practice, however, measurement errors will make the two figures slightly off when reported by national statistical agencies.

This method measures GDP by adding incomes that firms pay households for factors of production they hire – wages for labour, interest for capital, rent for land and profits for entrepreneurship.

The US &quot;National Income and Product Accounts&quot; divide incomes into five categories:
# Wages, salaries, and supplementary labor income
# Corporate profits
# Interest and miscellaneous investment income
# Income earned by sole proprietors and from the Housing subsector (net of expenses)
# Net income from transfer payments from businesses
These five income components sum to net domestic income at factor cost.

Two adjustments must be made to get GDP:
# Taxes on production and imports minus subsidies are added to get from factor cost to market prices.
# Depreciation (or capital consumption allowance) is added to get from net domestic product to gross domestic product.

Total income can be subdivided according to various schemes, leading to various formulae for GDP measured by the income approach. A common one is:
: GDP = + + + 
* Compensation of employees (COE) measures the total remuneration to employees for work done. It includes wages and salaries, as well as employer contributions to social security and other such programs.
* Gross operating surplus (GOS) is the surplus due to owners of incorporated businesses. Often called profits, although only a subset of total costs are subtracted from gross output to calculate GOS.
* Gross mixed income (GMI) is the same measure as GOS, but for unincorporated businesses. This often includes most small businesses.

The sum of COE, GOS and GMI is called total factor income; it is the income of all of the factors of production in society. It measures the value of GDP at factor (basic) prices. The difference between basic prices and final prices (those used in the expenditure calculation) is the total taxes and subsidies that the government has levied or paid on that production. So adding taxes less subsidies on production and imports converts GDP(I) at factor cost to GDP(I) at final prices.

Total factor income is also sometimes expressed as:
: &quot;Total factor income&quot; = &quot;employee compensation&quot; + &quot;corporate profits&quot; + &quot;proprietor&#x27;s income&quot; + &quot;rental income&quot; + &quot;net interest&quot;

=== Expenditure approach ===
The third way to estimate GDP is to calculate the sum of the final uses of goods and services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured in purchasers&#x27; prices.

Market goods that are produced are purchased by someone. In the case where a good is produced and unsold, the standard accounting convention is that the producer has bought the good from themselves. Therefore, measuring the total expenditure used to buy things is a way of measuring production. This is known as the expenditure method of calculating GDP.

==== Components of GDP by expenditure ====
GDP (Y) is the sum of consumption (C), investment (I), government expenditures (G) and net exports (X − M).
: Y = C + I + G + (X − M)

Here is a description of each GDP component:
* C (consumption) is normally the largest GDP component in the economy, consisting of private expenditures in the economy (household final consumption expenditure). These personal expenditures fall under one of the following categories: durable goods, nondurable goods, and services. Examples include food, rent, jewelry, gasoline, and medical expenses, but not the purchase of new housing.
* I (investment) includes, for instance, business investment in equipment, but does not include exchanges of existing assets. Examples include the construction of a new mine, the purchase of software, or the purchase of machinery and equipment for a factory. Spending by households (not the government) on new houses is also included in investment. In contrast to its colloquial meaning, &quot;investment&quot; in GDP does not mean purchases related to financial investments. Buying financial products is classed as &#x27;saving&#x27;, as opposed to investment. This avoids double-counting: if one buys shares in a company, and the company uses the money received to build a plant, purchase equipment, etc., the amount will be counted toward GDP when the company spends the money on those things; to also count it when one gives it to the company would be to count two times an amount that only corresponds to one group of products. Buying bonds or companies&#x27; equity shares is a swapping of deeds, a transfer of claims on future production, not directly an expenditure on products; buying an existing building will involve a positive investment by the buyer and a negative investment by the seller, netting to zero overall investment.
* G (government spending) is the sum of government expenditures on final goods and services. It includes salaries of public servants, purchases of weapons for the military and any investment expenditure by a government. It does not include any transfer payments, such as social security or unemployment benefits. Analyses outside the US will often treat government investment as part of &quot;investment&quot; rather than &quot;government spending&quot;.
* X (exports) represents gross exports. GDP captures the amount a country produces, including goods and services produced for other nations&#x27; consumption, therefore exports are added.
* M (imports) represents gross imports. Imports are subtracted since imported goods will be included in the terms G, I, or C, and must be deducted to avoid counting foreign supply as domestic.

C, I, and G are expenditures on final goods and services; expenditures on intermediate goods and services do not count. (Intermediate goods and services are those used by businesses to produce other goods and services within the accounting year.) So for example if a car manufacturer buys auto parts, assembles the car and sells it, only the final car sold is counted towards the GDP. Meanwhile, if a person buys replacement auto parts to install them on their car, those are counted towards the GDP.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, which is responsible for calculating the national accounts in the United States, &quot;In general, the source data for the expenditures components are considered more reliable than those for the income components [see income method, above].&quot;

Encyclopedia Britannica records an alternate way of measuring exports minus imports: notating it as the single variable NX.

=== National measurement ===

Within each country GDP is normally measured by a national government statistical agency, as private sector organizations normally do not have access to the information required (especially information on expenditure and production by governments).

==== International standards ====
The international standard for measuring GDP is contained in the book &quot;System of National Accounts&quot; (2008), which was prepared by representatives of the International Monetary Fund, European Union, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, United Nations and World Bank. The publication is normally referred to as SNA2008 to distinguish it from the previous edition published in 1993 (SNA93) or 1968 (called SNA68)

SNA2008 provides a set of rules and procedures for the measurement of national accounts. The standards are designed to be flexible, to allow for differences in local statistical needs and conditions.

== Nominal GDP and real GDP ==
The raw GDP figure given by the equations above is called the nominal, historical, or current GDP. When comparing GDP figures from one year to another, compensating for changes in the value of money—for the effects of inflation or deflation is desirable. To make it more meaningful for year-to-year comparisons, a nominal GDP may be multiplied by the ratio between the value of money in the year the GDP was measured and the value of money in a base year.

For example, suppose a country&#x27;s GDP in 1990 was and its GDP in 2000 was . Suppose also that inflation had halved the value of its currency over that period. To meaningfully compare its GDP in 2000 to its GDP in 1990, we could multiply the GDP in 2000 by one-half, to make it relative to 1990 as a base year. The result would be that the GDP in 2000 equals × = , &quot;in 1990 monetary terms.&quot; We would see that the country&#x27;s GDP had realistically increased 50 percent over that period, not 200 percent, as it might appear from the raw GDP data. The GDP adjusted for changes in money value in this way is called the real GDP.

The factor used to convert GDP from current to constant values in this way is called the &quot;GDP deflator&quot;. Unlike consumer price index, which measures inflation or deflation in the price of household consumer goods, the GDP deflator measures changes in the prices of all domestically produced goods and services in an economy including investment goods and government services, as well as household consumption goods.

== GDP per capita ==

GDP can be adjusted for population growth, also called &quot;Per-capita GDP&quot; or &quot;GDP per person&quot;. This measures the average production of a person in the country. Lists of GDP per capita:
* List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita
* List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita

The major advantage of GDP per capita as an indicator of the standard of living is that it is measured frequently, widely, and consistently. It is measured frequently in that most countries provide information on GDP every quarter, allowing trends to be seen quickly. It is measured widely in that some measure of GDP is available for almost every country in the world, allowing inter-country comparisons. It is measured consistently in that the technical definition of GDP is relatively consistent among countries.

It can be argued that GDP per capita is an indicator of standard of living. As a result, GDP per capita as a standard of living is a continued usage because most people have a fairly accurate idea of what it is and know it is tough to come up with quantitative measures for such constructs as happiness, quality of life, and well-being. From the perspective of environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures, GDP per capita trends can be influenced by factors such as gender parity and elements of regulatory quality. The change in number of MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) in the Philippines from 2008 through 2021 would be an example of elements such as the per capita gross domestic product and unemployment rate having significant effect on a developing country with mixed economy.

== Economic growth ==

Real GDP can be used to calculate the GDP growth rate, which indicates how much a country&#x27;s production has increased (or decreased, if the growth rate is negative) compared to the previous year, typically expressed as percentage change. The economic growth can be expressed as real GDP growth rate or real GDP per capita growth rate.

== Relation to GNI ==
GDP can be contrasted with gross national product (GNP) or, as it is now known, gross national income (GNI). The difference is that GDP defines its scope according to location, while GNI defines its scope according to ownership. In a global context, world GDP and world GNI are, therefore, equivalent terms.

GDP is a product produced within a country&#x27;s borders; GNI is product produced by enterprises owned by a country&#x27;s citizens. The two would be the same if all of the productive enterprises in a country were owned by its own citizens and those citizens did not own productive enterprises in any other countries. In practice, however, foreign ownership makes GDP and GNI non-identical. Production within a country&#x27;s borders, but by an enterprise owned by somebody outside the country, counts as part of its GDP but not its GNI; on the other hand, production by an enterprise located outside the country, but owned by one of its citizens, counts as part of its GNI but not its GDP.

For example, the GNI of the US is the value of output produced by American-owned firms, regardless of where the firms are located. Similarly, if a country becomes increasingly in debt, and spends large amounts of income servicing this debt this will be reflected in a decreased GNI but not a decreased GDP. Similarly, if a country sells off its resources to entities outside their country this will also be reflected over time in decreased GNI, but not decreased GDP. This would make the use of GDP more attractive for politicians in countries with increasing national debt and decreasing assets.

Gross national income (GNI) equals GDP plus income receipts from the rest of the world minus income payments to the rest of the world.

In 1991, the United States switched from using GNP to using GDP as its primary measure of production. The relationship between United States GDP and GNP is shown in table 1.7.5 of the &quot;National Income and Product Accounts&quot;.

You find other examples that amplify differences between GDP and GNI by comparing indicators of developed and developing countries. The GDP of Japan for 2020 was 5.05559 trillion. Predictably, as a developed country, we see a higher GNI of 5.16915 trillion for the same year. An increase of 113.560 million. This being indicative of the production level in the country being higher than that of national production. On the other hand, the case with Armenia is the opposite with its GNI in 2023 being lower than its GDP by 3.85 billion. This shows us countries receive investments and foreign aid from abroad.

== Limitations and criticisms ==
Simon Kuznets, the economist who developed the first comprehensive set of measures of national income, stated in his second report to the U.S. Congress in 1937, in a section titled &quot;Uses and Abuses of National Income Measurements&quot;:
 The valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria. With quantitative measurements especially, the definiteness of the result suggests, often misleadingly, a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured. Measurements of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse, especially since they deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification. [...]

All these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare. But in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values. Economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known. And no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income, that is, the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income. The welfare of a nation can, therefore, scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above. In 1962, Kuznets stated:Distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between costs and returns, and between the short and long run. Goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what.

GDP as initially defined includes spending on goods and services that would shrink if underlying problems were solved or reduced - for example, medical care, crime-fighting, and the military. During World War II, Kuznets came to argue that military spending should be excluded during peacetime. This idea did not become popular; these activities are tracked because they fit into macroeconomic models (e.g. military spending uses up capital and labor).

Ever since the development of GDP, multiple observers have pointed out limitations of using GDP as the overarching measure of economic and social progress. Furthermore, the GDP does not consider human health nor the educational aspect of a population.

Instances of GDP measures have been considered numbers that are artificial constructs. American politician Robert F. Kennedy criticized GDP (or GNP), listing many examples of bad things it does count and good things it does not count:
===Unpaid work===
GDP excludes the value of household and other unpaid work. Some, including Martha Nussbaum, argue that this value should be included in measuring GDP, as household labor is largely a substitute for goods and services that would otherwise be purchased with money. Even under conservative estimates, the value of unpaid labor in Australia has been calculated to be over 50% of the country&#x27;s GDP. A later study analyzed this value in other countries, with results ranging from a low of about 15% in Canada (using conservative estimates) to high of nearly 70% in the United Kingdom (using more liberal estimates). For the United States, the value was estimated to be between about 20% on the low end to nearly 50% on the high end, depending on the methodology being used. Because many public policies are shaped by GDP calculations and by the related field of national accounts, public policy might differ if unpaid work were included in total GDP. Some economists have advocated for changes in the way public policies are formed and implemented.

Some have pointed out that GDP did not adapt to sociotechnical changes to give a more accurate picture of the modern economy and does not encapsulate the value of new activities such as delivering price-free information and entertainment on social media. In 2017 Diane Coyle explained that GDP excludes much unpaid work, writing that &quot;many people contribute free digital work such as writing open-source software that can substitute for marketed equivalents, and it clearly has great economic value despite a price of zero&quot;, which constitutes a common criticism &quot;of the reliance on GDP as the measure of economic success&quot; especially after the emergence of the digital economy.

===GDP and assets===
The UK&#x27;s Natural Capital Committee highlighted the shortcomings of GDP in its advice to the UK Government in 2013, pointing out that GDP &quot;focuses on flows, not stocks. As a result, an economy can run down its assets yet, at the same time, record high levels of GDP growth, until a point is reached where the depleted assets act as a check on future growth&quot;. They then went on to say that &quot;it is apparent that the recorded GDP growth rate overstates the sustainable growth rate. Broader measures of wellbeing and wealth are needed for this and there is a danger that short-term decisions based solely on what is currently measured by national accounts may prove to be costly in the long-term&quot;.

===Health===
In 2013 scientists reported that large improvements in health only lead to modest long-term increases in GDP per capita. After developing an abstract metric similar to GDP, the Center for Partnership Studies highlighted that GDP &quot;and other metrics that reflect and perpetuate them&quot; may not be useful for facilitating the production of products and provision of services that are useful – or comparatively more useful – to society, and instead may &quot;actually encourage, rather than discourage, destructive activities&quot;. The number of obese adults was approximately 600 million (12%) in 2015.

===Environment===

Many environmentalists argue that GDP is a poor measure of social progress because it does not take into account harm to the environment.

In the language of economics, everything comes down to its monetary value. In essence, GDP rewards behaviors that are detrimental to the environment. GDP also does not capture certain phenomena impacting citizens&#x27; well-being. For example, traffic jams could cause GDP to increase as there is a higher consumption of gasoline, however, GDP fails to consider citizens&#x27; well-being in terms of the quality of air due to air pollution from the traffic jams. Various alternatives have been developed(see below).

A 2020 study found that &quot;poor regions&#x27; GDP grows faster by attracting more polluting production after connection to China&#x27;s expressway system. GDP may not be a tool capable of recognizing how much natural capital agents of the economy are building or protecting.
In 2020 scientists, as part of a World Scientists&#x27; Warning to Humanity-associated series, warned that worldwide growth in affluence in terms of GDP-metrics has increased resource use and pollutant emissions with affluent citizens of the world – in terms of e.g. resource-intensive consumption – being responsible for most negative environmental impacts and central to a transition to safer, sustainable conditions. They summarised evidence, presented solution approaches and stated that far-reaching lifestyle changes need to complement technological advancements and that existing societies, economies and cultures incite consumption expansion and that the structural imperative for growth in competitive market economies inhibits societal change. Sarah Arnold, Senior Economist at the New Economics Foundation (NEF) stated that &quot;GDP includes activities that are detrimental to our economy and society in the long term, such as deforestation, strip mining, overfishing and so on&quot;. The number of trees that are net lost annually is estimated to be approximately 10 billion. The global average annual deforested land in the 2015–2020 demi-decade was 10 million hectares and the average annual net forest area loss in the 2000–2010 decade 4.7 million hectares, according to the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020. According to one study, depending on the level of wealth inequality, higher GDP-growth can be associated with more deforestation. In 2019 &quot;agriculture and agribusiness&quot; accounted for 24% of the GDP of Brazil, where a large share of annual net tropical forest loss occurred and is associated with sizable portions of this economic activity domain.

Steve Cohen of the Earth Institute elucidated that while GDP does not distinguish between different activities (or lifestyles), &quot;all consumption behaviors are not created equal and do not have the same impact on environmental sustainability&quot;. Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, noted that &quot;it&#x27;s difficult to see if the current G.D.P.-based model of economic growth can go hand-in-hand with rapid cutting of emissions&quot;, which nations have agreed to attempt under the Paris Agreement in order to mitigate real-world impacts of climate change.

In 1989, John B. Cobb and Herman Daly introduced Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) by taking into account other factors such as consumption of nonrenewable resources and degradation of the environment. ISEW is roughly defined as: personal consumption + public non-defensive expenditures − private defensive expenditures + capital formation + services from domestic labour − costs of environmental degradation − depreciation of natural capital.
In 2005, Med Jones, an American Economist, at the International Institute of Management, introduced the first secular Gross National Happiness Index a.k.a. Gross National Well-being framework and Index to complement GDP economics with additional seven dimensions, including environment, education, and government, work, social and health (mental and physical) indicators. The proposal was inspired by the King of Bhutan&#x27;s GNH philosophy.
In 2019, Serge Pierre Besanger published a &quot;GDP 3.0&quot; proposal which combines an expanded GNI formula which he calls GNIX, with a Palma ratio and a set of environmental metrics based on the Daly Rule.

=== Standard of living ===
Although a high or rising level of GDP is often associated with increased economic and social progress, the opposite sometimes occurs. For example, Jean Drèze and Amartya Sen have pointed out that an increase in GDP or in GDP growth does not necessarily lead to a higher standard of living, particularly in areas such as healthcare and education. Another important area that does not necessarily improve along with GDP is political liberty, which is most notable in China, where GDP growth is strong yet political liberties are heavily restricted. GDP does not account for the distribution of income among the residents of a country, because GDP is merely an aggregate measure. An economy may be highly developed or growing rapidly, but also contain a wide gap between the rich and the poor in a society. These inequalities often occur on the lines of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or other minority status within countries. This can lead to misleading characterizations of economic well-being if the income distribution is heavily skewed toward the high end, as the poorer residents will not directly benefit from the overall level of wealth and income generated in their country (their purchasing power can decline, even as the mean GDP per capita rises). GDP per capita measures (like aggregate GDP measures) do not account for income distribution (and tend to overstate the average income per capita). For example, South Africa during apartheid ranked high in terms of GDP per capita, but the benefits of this immense wealth and income were not shared equally among its citizens. The United Nations has aimed in its Sustainable Development Goals, amongst other global initiatives, to address wealth inequality.

GDP does not include several factors that influence the standard of living. In particular, it fails to account for:
* Externalities – Economic growth may entail an increase in negative externalities that are not directly measured in GDP. Increased industrial output might grow GDP, but any pollution is not counted.
* Non-market transactions – GDP excludes activities that are not provided through the market, such as household production, bartering of goods and services, and volunteer or unpaid services.
* Non-monetary economy – GDP omits economies where no money comes into play at all, resulting in inaccurate or abnormally low GDP figures. For example, in countries with major business transactions occurring informally, portions of local economy are not easily registered. Bartering may be more prominent than the use of money, even extending to services.
* Quality improvements and inclusion of new products – by not fully adjusting for quality improvements and new products, GDP understates true economic growth. For instance, although computers today are less expensive and more powerful than computers from the past, GDP treats them as the same products by only accounting for their monetary value. The introduction of new products is also difficult to measure accurately and is not reflected in GDP although it may increase the standard of living. For example, even the richest person in 1900 could not purchase standard products, such as antibiotics and cell phones, that an average consumer can buy today, since such modern conveniences did not exist then.
* Sustainability of growth – GDP is a measurement of economic historic activity and is not necessarily a projection.
* Income distribution – GDP does not account for variances in incomes of various demographic groups. See income inequality metrics for discussion of a variety of inequality-based economic measures.

=== Proposals to overcome GDP limitations ===
In response to these and other limitations of using GDP, alternative approaches have emerged.
* In the 1980s, Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum developed the capability approach, which focuses on the functional capabilities enjoyed by people within a country, rather than the aggregate wealth held within a country. These capabilities consist of the functions that a person is able to achieve.
* In 1990, Mahbub ul Haq, a Pakistani economist at the United Nations, introduced the Human Development Index (HDI). The HDI is a composite index of life expectancy at birth, adult literacy rate and standard of living measured as a logarithmic function of GDP, adjusted to purchasing power parity.
* In 2009 the European Union released a communication titled &quot;GDP and beyond: Measuring progress in a changing world&quot; that identified five actions to improve indicators of progress in ways that make them more responsive to the concerns of its citizens.
* In 2009 Professors Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen, and Jean-Paul Fitoussi at the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress (CMEPSP), formed by French President, Nicolas Sarkozy published a proposal to overcome the limitation of GDP economics to expand the focus to well-being economics with a well-being framework consisting of health, environment, work, physical safety, economic safety, and political freedom. This has been adopted in a number of countries as a wellbeing economy policy.
* In 2008, the Centre for Bhutan Studies began publishing the Bhutan Gross National Happiness (GNH) Index, whose contributors to happiness include physical, mental, and spiritual health; time balance; social and community vitality; cultural vitality; education; living standards; good governance; and ecological vitality.
* In 2013, the OECD Better Life Index was published by the OECD. The dimensions of the index included health, economic, workplace, income, jobs, housing, civic engagement, and life satisfaction.
* Since 2012, John Helliwell, Richard Layard and Jeffrey Sachs have edited an annual World Happiness Report which reports a national measure of subjective well-being, derived from a single survey question on satisfaction with life. GDP explains some of the cross-national variation in life satisfaction, but more of it is explained by other, social variables (See 2013 World Happiness Report).
* In 2019, Erik Brynjolfsson and Avinash Collis argued that GDP does not reflect the growing value of many digital goods because they have zero price. Along with several coauthors, they proposed an alternative approach, GDP-B, which is based on measuring the &quot;benefits&quot; of goods and services, rather than their price or cost.
* At the beginning of the 21st century the World Economic Forum published a series of analyses and propositions to create economic measurement tools more effective than GDP.
* China launched the Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) in 2020. It measures the contribution of ecosystems to the economy, including by regulating climate. It spread widely across the country. The first province to issue local rules about GEP was Zhejiang , and a year later it has already decided the fate of a project in the Deqing region. For example, the GEP of Chengtian Radon Spring Nature Reserve has been calculated as US$43 million.

=== Problems with GDP data ===

A peer-reviewed study published in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; in October 2022 found signs of manipulation of economic growth statistics in the majority of countries. According to the study, this mainly applied to countries that were governed semi-authoritarian/authoritarian or did not have a functioning separation of powers. The study took the annual growth in the brightness of lights at night, as measured by satellites, and compared it to officially reported economic growth. Authoritarian states had consistently higher reported growth in GDP than their growth in night lights would suggest. An effect that also cannot be explained by different economic structures, sector composition or other factors. Incorrect growth statistics can also falsify indicators such as GDP or GDP per capita.

It has been suggested that countries that have authoritarian governments, such as the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and Russia, inflate their GDP figures.

Corporate havens can have a distorted GDP.

<doc id="12598" wikidata="Q9235" url="?curid=12598" title="Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel">
<text>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (27 August 1770 – 14 November 1831) was a German philosopher and one of the most influential figures of German idealism and 19th-century philosophy. His influence extends across the entire range of contemporary philosophical topics, from metaphysical issues in epistemology and ontology, to political philosophy, the philosophy of history, philosophy of art, philosophy of religion, and the history of philosophy.

Born in 1770 in Stuttgart, Holy Roman Empire, during the transitional period between the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement in the Germanic regions of Europe, Hegel lived through and was influenced by the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars. His fame rests chiefly upon &quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;, &quot;The Science of Logic&quot;, his teleological account of history, and his lectures at the University of Berlin on topics from his &quot;Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences&quot;.

Throughout his work, Hegel strove to address and correct the problematic dualisms of modern philosophy, Kantian and otherwise, typically by drawing upon the resources of ancient philosophy, particularly Aristotle. Hegel everywhere insists that reason and freedom, despite being natural potentials, are historical achievements. His dialectical-speculative procedure is grounded in the principle of immanence, that is, in assessing claims always according to their own internal criteria. Taking skepticism seriously, he contends that people cannot presume any truths that have not passed the test of experience; even the &quot;a priori&quot; categories of the &quot;Logic&quot; must attain their &quot;verification&quot; in the natural world and the historical accomplishments of humankind.

Guided by the Delphic imperative to &quot;know thyself&quot;, Hegel presents free self-determination as the essence of humankind – a conclusion from his 1806–07 &quot;Phenomenology&quot; that he claims is further verified by the systematic account of the interdependence of logic, nature, and spirit in his later &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;. He asserts that the &quot;Logic&quot; at once preserves and overcomes the dualisms of the material and the mental – that is, it accounts for both the continuity and difference marking the domains of nature and culture – as a metaphysically necessary and coherent &quot;identity of identity and non-identity&quot;.

== Life ==
===Formative years===
====Stuttgart, Tübingen, Berne, Frankfurt (1770–1800)====
 Hegel was born on 27 August 1770 in Stuttgart, capital of the Duchy of Württemberg in the Holy Roman Empire (now southwestern Germany). Christened Georg Wilhelm Friedrich, he was known as Wilhelm to his close family. His father, Georg Ludwig Hegel (1733–1799), was secretary to the revenue office at the court of Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg. Hegel&#x27;s mother, Maria Magdalena Louisa Hegel, née Fromm (1741–1783), was the daughter of a lawyer at the High Court of Justice at the Württemberg court Ludwig Albrecht Fromm (1696–1758). She died of bilious fever when Hegel was thirteen. Hegel and his father also caught the disease but narrowly survived. Hegel had a sister, (1773–1832); and a brother, Georg Ludwig (1776–1812), who perished as an officer during Napoleon&#x27;s 1812 Russian campaign. At the age of three, Hegel went to the German School. When he entered the Latin School two years later, he already knew the first declension, having been taught it by his mother. In 1776, he entered Stuttgart&#x27;s Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium and during his adolescence read voraciously, copying lengthy extracts in his diary. Authors he read include the poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock and writers associated with the Enlightenment, such as Christian Garve and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. In 1844, Hegel&#x27;s first biographer, Karl Rosenkranz described the young Hegel&#x27;s education there by saying that it &quot;belonged entirely to the Enlightenment with respect to principle, and entirely to classical antiquity with respect to curriculum.&quot; His studies at the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; concluded with his graduation speech, &quot;The abortive state of art and scholarship in Turkey.&quot;
At the age of eighteen, Hegel entered the Tübinger Stift, a Protestant seminary attached to the University of Tübingen, where he had as roommates the poet and philosopher Friedrich Hölderlin and the future philosopher Friedrich Schelling. Sharing a dislike for what they regarded as the restrictive environment of the Seminary, the three became close friends and mutually influenced each other&#x27;s ideas. (It is mostly likely that Hegel attended the &quot;Stift&quot; because it was state-funded, for he had &quot;a profound distaste for the study of orthodox theology&quot; and never wanted to become a minister.) All three greatly admired Hellenic civilization, and Hegel additionally steeped himself in Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Lessing during this time. They watched the unfolding of the French Revolution with shared enthusiasm. Although the violence of the 1793 Reign of Terror dampened Hegel&#x27;s hopes, he continued to identify with the moderate Girondin faction and never lost his commitment to the principles of 1789, which he expressed by drinking a toast to the storming of the Bastille every fourteenth of July. Schelling and Hölderlin immersed themselves in theoretical debates on Kantian philosophy, from which Hegel remained aloof. Hegel, at this time, envisaged his future as that of a &quot;Popularphilosoph&quot; (a &quot;man of letters&quot;) who serves to make the abstruse ideas of philosophers accessible to a wider public; his own felt need to engage critically with the central ideas of Kantianism would not come until 1800.
Having received his theological certificate from the Tübingen Seminary, Hegel became &quot;Hofmeister&quot; (house tutor) to an aristocratic family in Berne (1793–1796). During this period, he composed the text which has become known as the &quot;Life of Jesus&quot; and a book-length manuscript titled &quot;The Positivity of the Christian Religion.&quot; His relations with his employers becoming strained, Hegel accepted an offer mediated by Hölderlin to take up a similar position with a wine merchant&#x27;s family in Frankfurt in 1797. There, Hölderlin exerted an important influence on Hegel&#x27;s thought. In Berne, Hegel&#x27;s writings had been sharply critical of orthodox Christianity, but in Frankfurt, under the influence of early Romanticism, he underwent a sort of reversal, exploring, in particular, the mystical experience of love as the true essence of religion. Also in 1797, the unpublished and unsigned manuscript of &quot;The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism&quot; was written. It was written in Hegel&#x27;s hand, but may have been authored by Hegel, Schelling, or Hölderlin. While in Frankfurt, Hegel composed the essay &quot;Fragments on Religion and Love.&quot; In 1799, he wrote another essay titled &quot;The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate&quot;, unpublished during his lifetime.

===Career years===
====Jena, Bamberg, Nuremberg (1801–1816)====

In 1801, Hegel came to Jena at the encouragement of Schelling, who held the position of Extraordinary Professor at the University of Jena. Hegel secured a position at the University of Jena as a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; (unsalaried lecturer) after submitting the inaugural dissertation &quot;De Orbitis Planetarum&quot;, in which he briefly criticized mathematical arguments that assert that there must exist a planet between Mars and Jupiter. Later in the year, Hegel&#x27;s essay &quot;The Difference Between Fichte&#x27;s and Schelling&#x27;s System of Philosophy&quot; was completed. He lectured on &quot;Logic and Metaphysics&quot; and gave lectures with Schelling on an &quot;Introduction to the Idea and Limits of True Philosophy&quot; and facilitated a &quot;philosophical disputorium.&quot; In 1802, Schelling and Hegel founded the journal &quot;Kritische Journal der Philosophie&quot; (&quot;Critical Journal of Philosophy&quot;) to which they contributed until the collaboration ended when Schelling left for Würzburg in 1803. In 1805, the university promoted Hegel to the unsalaried position of extraordinary professor after he wrote a letter to the poet and minister of culture Johann Wolfgang von Goethe protesting the promotion of his philosophical adversary Jakob Friedrich Fries ahead of him. Hegel attempted to enlist the help of the poet and translator Johann Heinrich Voß to obtain a post at the renascent University of Heidelberg, but he failed. To his chagrin, Fries was, in the same year, made ordinary professor (salaried). The following February marked the birth of Hegel&#x27;s illegitimate son, Georg Ludwig Friedrich Fischer (1807–1831), as the result of an affair with Hegel&#x27;s landlady Christiana Burkhardt née Fischer. With his finances drying up quickly, Hegel was under great pressure to deliver his book, the long-promised introduction to his philosophical system. Hegel was putting the finishing touches to it, &quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;, as Napoleon engaged Prussian troops on 14 October 1806 in the Battle of Jena on a plateau outside the city. On the day before the battle, Napoleon entered the city of Jena. Hegel recounted his impressions in a letter to his friend Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer:

I saw the Emperor – this world-soul [&quot;Weltseele&quot;] – riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it. 

Hegel biographer Terry Pinkard notes that Hegel&#x27;s comment to Niethammer &quot;is all the more striking since he had already composed the crucial section of the &quot;Phenomenology&quot; in which he remarked that the Revolution had now officially passed to another land (Germany) that would complete &#x27;in thought&#x27; what the Revolution had only partially accomplished in practice.&quot; Although Napoleon had spared the University of Jena from much of the destruction of the surrounding city, few students returned after the battle and enrollment suffered, making Hegel&#x27;s financial prospects even worse. Hegel traveled in the winter to Bamberg and stayed with Niethammer to oversee the proofs of the &quot;Phenomenology&quot;, which was being printed there. Although Hegel tried to obtain another professorship, even writing Goethe in an attempt to help secure a permanent position replacing a professor of botany, he was unable to find a permanent position. In 1807, he had to move to Bamberg since his savings and the payment from the &quot;Phenomenology&quot; were exhausted and he needed money to support his illegitimate son Ludwig. There, he became the editor of the local newspaper, &quot;&quot;, a position he obtained with the help of Niethammer. Ludwig Fischer and his mother stayed behind in Jena.
In Bamberg, as editor of the &quot;&quot;, which was a pro-French newspaper, Hegel extolled the virtues of Napoleon and often editorialized the Prussian accounts of the war. Being the editor of a local newspaper, Hegel also became an important person in Bamberg social life, often visiting with the local official , and becoming involved in local gossip and pursued his passions for cards, fine eating, and the local Bamberg beer. However, Hegel bore contempt for what he saw as &quot;old Bavaria&quot;, frequently referring to it as &quot;Barbaria&quot; and dreaded that &quot;hometowns&quot; like Bamberg would lose their autonomy under new the Bavarian state. After being investigated in September 1808 by the Bavarian state for potentially violating security measures by publishing French troop movements, Hegel wrote to Niethammer, now a high official in Munich, pleading for Niethammer&#x27;s help in securing a teaching position. With the help of Niethammer, Hegel was appointed headmaster of a &quot;gymnasium&quot; in Nuremberg in November 1808, a post he held until 1816. While in Nuremberg, Hegel adapted his recently published &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; for use in the classroom. Part of his remit was to teach a class called &quot;Introduction to Knowledge of the Universal Coherence of the Sciences.&quot; In 1811, Hegel married Marie Helena Susanna von Tucher (1791–1855), the eldest daughter of a Senator. This period saw the publication of his second major work, the &quot;Science of Logic&quot; (&quot;Wissenschaft der Logik&quot;; 3 vols., 1812, 1813 and 1816), and the birth of two sons, Karl Friedrich Wilhelm (1813–1901) and Immanuel Thomas Christian (1814–1891).

====Heidelberg, Berlin (1816–1831)====
 Having received offers of a post from the Universities of Erlangen, Berlin and Heidelberg, Hegel chose Heidelberg, where he moved in 1816. Soon after, his illegitimate son Ludwig Fischer (now ten years old) joined the Hegel household in April 1817, having spent time in an orphanage after the death of his mother Christiana Burkhardt. In 1817, Hegel published &quot;The Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences in Outline&quot; as a summary of his philosophy for students attending his lectures at Heidelberg. It is also while in Heidelberg that Hegel first lectured on the philosophy of art. In 1818, Hegel accepted the renewed offer of the chair of philosophy at the University of Berlin, which had remained vacant since Johann Gottlieb Fichte&#x27;s death in 1814. Here, Hegel published his &quot;Elements of the Philosophy of Right&quot; (1821). Hegel devoted himself primarily to delivering lectures; his lectures on the philosophy of fine art, the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of history, and the history of philosophy were published posthumously from students&#x27; notes. In spite of his notoriously terrible delivery, his fame spread and his lectures attracted students from all over Germany and beyond. Meanwhile, Hegel and his pupils, such as Leopold von Henning, Friedrich Wilhelm Carové, were harassed and put under the surveillance of Prince Sayn-Wittgenstein, the interior minister of Prussia and his reactionary circles in the Prussian court. In the remainder of his career, he made two trips to Weimar, where he met with Goethe for the last time, and to Brussels, the Northern Netherlands, Leipzig, Vienna, Prague, and Paris.
During the last ten years of his life, Hegel did not publish another book but thoroughly revised the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; (second edition, 1827; third, 1830). In his political philosophy, he criticized Karl Ludwig von Haller&#x27;s reactionary work, which claimed that laws were not necessary. A number of other works on the philosophy of history, religion, aesthetics and the history of philosophy were compiled from the lecture notes of his students and published posthumously.

Hegel was appointed University Rector of the university in October 1829, but his term ended in September 1830. Hegel was deeply disturbed by the riots for reform in Berlin in that year. In 1831 Frederick William III decorated him with the Order of the Red Eagle, 3rd Class for his service to the Prussian state. In August 1831, a cholera epidemic reached Berlin and Hegel left the city, taking up lodgings in Kreuzberg. Now in a weak state of health, Hegel seldom went out. As the new semester began in October, Hegel returned to Berlin in the mistaken belief that the epidemic had largely subsided. By 14 November, Hegel was dead. The physicians pronounced the cause of death as cholera, but it is likely he died from another gastrointestinal disease. His last words are said to have been, &quot;There was only one man who ever understood me, and even he didn&#x27;t understand me.&quot; He was buried on 16 November. In accordance with his wishes, Hegel was buried in the Dorotheenstadt cemetery next to Fichte and Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand Solger.

Hegel&#x27;s illegitimate son, Ludwig Fischer, had died shortly before while serving with the Dutch army in Batavia and the news of his death never reached his father. Early the following year, Hegel&#x27;s sister Christiane committed suicide by drowning. Hegel&#x27;s two remaining sons – Karl, who became a historian; and , who followed a theological path – lived long and safeguarded their father&#x27;s manuscripts and letters, and produced editions of his works.

== Influences ==
As H. S. Harris recounts, when Hegel entered the Tübingen seminary in 1788, &quot;he was a typical product of the German Enlightenment – an enthusiastic reader of Rousseau and Lessing, acquainted with Kant (at least at second hand), but perhaps more deeply devoted to the classics than to any thing modern.&quot; During this early period of his life &quot;the Greeks – especially Plato – came first.&quot; Although he later elevated Aristotle above Plato, Hegel never abandoned his love of ancient philosophy, the imprint of which is everywhere in his thought.

Hegel&#x27;s concern with various forms of cultural unity (Judaic, Greek, medieval, and modern) during this early period would remain with him throughout his career. In this way, he was also a typical product of early German romanticism. &quot;Unity of life&quot; was the phrase used by Hegel and his generation to express their concept of the highest good. It encompasses unity &quot;with oneself, with others, and with nature. The main threat to such unity consists in division (&quot;Entzweiung&quot;) or alienation (&quot;Entfremdung&quot;).&quot;

In this respect, Hegel was particularly taken with the phenomenon of &quot;love&quot; as a kind of &quot;unity-in-difference,&quot; this both in the ancient articulation provided by Plato and in the Christian religion&#x27;s doctrine of &quot;agape&quot;, which Hegel at this time viewed as &quot;already &#x27;grounded on universal Reason. This interest, as well as his theological training, would continue to mark his thought, even as it developed in a more theoretical or metaphysical direction.

According to Glenn Alexander Magee, Hegel&#x27;s thought (in particular, the tripartite structure of his system) also owes much to the hermetic tradition, in particular, the work of Jakob Böhme. The conviction that philosophy must take the form of a system Hegel owed, most particularly, to his Tübingen roommates, Schelling and Hölderlin.

Hegel also read widely and was much influenced by Adam Smith and other theorists of the political economy.

It was Kant&#x27;s critical philosophy that provided what Hegel took as the definitive modern articulation of the divisions that must be overcome. This led to his engagement with the philosophical programs of Fichte and Schelling, as well as his attention to Spinoza and the Pantheism controversy. The influence of Johann Gottfried von Herder, however, would lead Hegel to a qualified rejection of the universality claimed by the Kantian program in favor of a more culturally, linguistically, and historically informed account of reason.

== &quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; ==
&quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; was published in 1807. This is the first time that, at the age of thirty-six, Hegel lays out &quot;his own distinctive approach&quot; and adopts an &quot;outlook that is recognizably &#x27;Hegelian&#x27; to the philosophical problems of post-Kantian philosophy&quot;. Yet, the book was poorly understood even by Hegel&#x27;s contemporaries and received mostly negative reviews. To this day, the &quot;Phenomenology&quot; is infamous for, among other things, its conceptual and allusive density, idiosyncratic terminology, and confusing transitions. Its most comprehensive commentary, scholar H. S. Harris&#x27;s two-volume &quot;Hegel&#x27;s Ladder&quot; (&quot;The Pilgrimage of Reason&quot; and &quot;The Odyssey of Spirit&quot;), runs more than three times the length of the text itself.

The fourth chapter of the &quot;Phenomenology&quot; includes Hegel&#x27;s first presentation of the lord-bondsman dialectic, the section of the book that has been most influential in general culture. What is at stake in the conflict Hegel presents is the practical (not theoretical) recognition or acknowledgement [&quot;Anerkennung&quot;, &quot;anerkennen&quot;] of the universality – i.e., personhood, humanity – of each of two opposed self-consciousnesses. What the readers learn, but what the self-consciousnesses described do not yet realize, is that recognition can only be successful and actual as reciprocal or mutual. This is the case for the simple reason that the recognition of someone you do not recognize as properly human cannot count as genuine recognition. Hegel can also be seen here as criticizing the individualist worldview of people and society as a collection of atomized individuals, instead taking a holistic view of human self-consciousness as requiring the recognition of others, and people&#x27;s view of themselves as being shaped by the views of others.

Hegel describes &quot;The Phenomenology&quot; as both the &quot;introduction&quot; to his philosophical system and also as the &quot;first part&quot; of that system as the &quot;science of the experience of consciousness.&quot; Yet it has long been controversial in both respects; indeed, Hegel&#x27;s own attitude changed throughout his life.

Nevertheless, however complicated the details, the basic strategy by which it attempts to make good on its introductory claim is not difficult to state. Beginning with only the most basic &quot;certainties of consciousness itself,&quot; &quot;the most immediate of which is the certainty that &quot;I&quot; am conscious of &quot;this&quot; object, &quot;here&quot; and &quot;now&quot;,&quot; Hegel aims to show that these &quot;certainties of natural consciousness&quot; have as their consequence the standpoint of speculative logic.

This does not, however, make the &quot;Phenomenology&quot; a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;. It is not the consciousness under observation that learns from its experience. Only &quot;we,&quot; the phenomenological observers, are in a position to profit from Hegel&#x27;s logical reconstruction of the science of experience.

The ensuing dialectic is long and hard. It is described by Hegel himself as a &quot;path of despair,&quot; in which self-consciousness finds itself to be, over and again, in error. It is the self-concept of consciousness itself that is tested in the domain of experience, and where that concept is not adequate, self-consciousness &quot;suffers this violence at its own hands, and brings to ruin its own restricted satisfaction.&quot; For, as Hegel points out, one cannot learn how to swim without getting into the water. By progressively testing its concept of knowledge in this way, by &quot;making experience his standard of knowledge, Hegel is embarking upon nothing less than a &quot;transcendental deduction&quot; of metaphysics.&quot;

In the course of its dialectic, the &quot;Phenomenology&quot; purports to demonstrate that – because consciousness always includes self-consciousness – there are no &#x27;given&#x27; objects of direct awareness not already mediated by thought. Further analysis of the structure of self-consciousness reveals that both the social and conceptual stability of the experiential world depend upon networks of reciprocal recognition. Failures of recognition, then, demand reflection upon the past as a way &quot;to understand what is required of us at the present.&quot; For Hegel, this ultimately involves rethinking an interpretation of &quot;religion as the collective reflection of the modern community on what ultimately counts for it.&quot; He contends, finally, that this &quot;historically, socially construed philosophical account of that whole process&quot; elucidates the genesis of a distinctly &quot;modern&quot; standpoint.

Another way of putting this is to say that the &quot;Phenomenology&quot; takes up Kant&#x27;s philosophical project of investigating the capacities and limits of reason. Under the influence of Herder, however, Hegel proceeds historically, instead of altogether a priori. Yet, although proceeding historically, Hegel resists the relativistic consequences of Herder&#x27;s own thought. In the words of one scholar, &quot;It is Hegel&#x27;s insight that reason itself has a history, that what counts as reason is the result of a development. This is something that Kant never imagines and that Herder only glimpses.&quot;

&quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; shows that the search for an externally objective criterion of truth is a fool&#x27;s errand. The constraints on knowledge are necessarily internal to spirit itself. Yet, although theories and self-conceptions may always be reevaluated, renegotiated, and revised, this is not a merely imaginative exercise. Claims to knowledge must always prove their own adequacy in real historical experience.

Although Hegel seemed during his Berlin years to have abandoned &quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;, at the time of his unexpected death, he was in fact making plans to revise and republish it. As Hegel was no longer in need of money or credentials, H. S. Harris argues that &quot;the only rational conclusion that can be drawn from his decision to republish the book… is that he still regarded the &#x27;science of experience&#x27; as a valid project in itself&quot; and one for which later system has no equivalent. There is, however, no scholarly consensus about the &quot;Phenomenology&quot; with respect to either of the systematic roles asserted by Hegel at the time of its publication.

== Philosophical system ==

Hegel&#x27;s philosophical system is divided into three parts: the science of logic, the philosophy of nature, and the philosophy of spirit (the latter two of which together constitute the real philosophy). This structure is adopted from Proclus&#x27;s Neoplatonic triad of remaining-procession-return&#x27; and from the Christian Trinity.&quot; Although evident in draft writings dating back as early as 1805, the system was not completed in published form until the 1817 &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; (1st ed.).

Historian of philosophy Frederick C. Beiser argues that the position of the logic with respect to the real philosophy is best understood in terms of Hegel&#x27;s appropriation of Aristotle&#x27;s distinction between &quot;the order of explanation&quot; and &quot;the order of being.&quot; To Beiser, Hegel is neither a Platonist who believes in abstract logical entities, nor a nominalist according to whom the particular is first in the orders of explanation and being alike. Rather, Hegel is a holist. For Hegel, the universal is always first in the order of explanation even if what is naturally particular is first in the order of being. With respect to the system as a whole, that universal is supplied by the logic.

Scholar Michael J. Inwood states, &quot;The logical idea is non-temporal and therefore does not exist at any time apart from its manifestations.&quot; To ask &quot;when&quot; it divides into nature and spirit is analogous to asking &quot;when&quot; 12 divides into 5 and 7. The question does not have an answer because it is predicated upon a fundamental misunderstanding of its terms. The task of the logic (at this high systemic level) is to articulate what Hegel calls &quot;the identity of identity and non-identity&quot; of nature and spirit. Put another way, it aims to overcome subject-object dualism. This is to say that, among other things, Hegel&#x27;s philosophical project endeavors to provide the metaphysical basis for an account of spirit that is continuous with, yet distinct from, the &quot;merely&quot; natural world – without thereby reducing either term to the other.

Furthermore, the final sections of Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; suggest that to give priority to any one of its three parts is to have an interpretation that is &quot;one-sided,&quot; incomplete or otherwise inaccurate. As Hegel declares, &quot;The true is the whole.&quot;

=== &quot;Science of Logic&quot; ===

Hegel&#x27;s concept of logic differs greatly from that of the ordinary English sense of the term. This can be seen, for instance, in such metaphysical definitions of logic as &quot;the science of &quot;things&quot; grasped in [the] &quot;thoughts&quot; that used to be taken to express the &quot;essentialities&quot; of the &quot;things&quot;.&quot; As Michael Wolff explains, Hegel&#x27;s logic is a continuation of Kant&#x27;s distinctive logical program. Its occasional engagement with the familiar Aristotelian conception of logic is only incidental to Hegel&#x27;s project. Twentieth-century developments by such logicians as Frege and Russell likewise remain logics of formal validity and so are likewise irrelevant to Hegel&#x27;s project, which aspires to provide a metaphysical logic of truth.

There are two texts of Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Logic&quot;. The first, &quot;The Science of Logic&quot; (1812, 1813, 1816; bk.I revised 1831), is sometimes also called the &quot;Greater Logic.&quot; The second is the first volume of Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; and is sometimes known as the &quot;Lesser Logic.&quot; The &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; Logic is an abbreviated or condensed presentation of the same dialectic. Hegel composed it for use with students in the lecture hall, not as a substitute for its proper, book-length exposition.

Hegel presents logic as a presuppositionless science that investigates the most fundamental thought-determinations [&quot;Denkbestimmungen&quot;], or categories, and so constitutes the basis of philosophy. In putting something into question, one already presupposes logic; in this regard, it is the only field of inquiry that must constantly reflect upon its own mode of functioning. &quot;The Science of Logic&quot; is Hegel&#x27;s attempt to meet this foundational demand. As he puts it, &quot;&quot;logic&quot; coincides with &quot;metaphysics&quot;.&quot; In the words of scholar Glenn Alexander Magee, the logic provides &quot;an account of pure categories or ideas which are timelessly true&quot; and which make up &quot;the formal structure of reality itself&quot;.

This is not, however, a return to the Leibnizian-Wolffian rationalism critiqued by Kant, which is a criticism Hegel accepts. Hegel rejects any form of metaphysics as speculation about the transcendent. His procedure, an appropriation of Aristotle&#x27;s concept of form, is fully immanent. More generally, Hegel agrees with Kant&#x27;s rejection of all forms of dogmatism and also agrees that any future metaphysics must pass the test of criticism.

Philosopher Béatrice Longuenesse holds that this project may be understood, on analogy to Kant, as &quot;inseparably a metaphysical and a transcendental deduction of the categories of metaphysics.&quot; This approach insists, and claims to demonstrate, that the insights of logic cannot be judged by standards external to thought itself, that is, that &quot;thought... is not the mirror of nature.&quot; Yet, she argues, this does not imply that these standards are arbitrary or subjective. Hegel&#x27;s translator and scholar of German idealism George di Giovanni likewise interprets the &quot;Logic&quot; as (drawing upon, yet also in opposition to, Kant) &quot;immanently&quot; transcendental; its categories, according to Hegel, are built into &quot;life itself&quot;, and define what it is to be &quot;an object in general.&quot;

Books one and two of the &quot;Logic&quot; are the doctrines of &quot;Being&quot; and &quot;Essence.&quot; Together they comprise the Objective Logic, which is largely occupied with overcoming the assumptions of traditional metaphysics. Book three is the final part of the &quot;Logic&quot;. It discusses the doctrine of &quot;the Concept,&quot; which is concerned with reintegrating those categories of objectivity into a thoroughly idealistic account of reality. Simplifying greatly, Being describes its concepts just as they appear, Essence attempts to explain them with reference to opposites, and the Concept explains and unites them both in terms of an internal teleology. The categories of Being &quot;pass over&quot; from one to the next as denoting thought-determinations only extrinsically connected to one another. The categories of Essence reciprocally &quot;shine&quot; into one another. Finally, in the Concept, thought has shown itself to be fully self-referential, and so its categories organically &quot;develop&quot; from one to the next.

In Hegel&#x27;s technical sense of the term, the concept (&quot;Begriff&quot;, sometimes also rendered &quot;notion,&quot; capitalized by some translators but not others) is not a psychological concept. When deployed with the definitive article (&quot;the&quot;) and sometimes modified by the term &quot;logical,&quot; Hegel is referring to the intelligible structure of reality as articulated in the Subjective Logic. (When used in the plural, however, Hegel&#x27;s sense is much closer to the ordinary dictionary sense of the term.)

Hegel&#x27;s inquiry into thought is concerned to systematize thought&#x27;s own internal self-differentiation, that is, how pure concepts (logical categories) differ from one another in their various relations of implication and interdependence. For instance, in the opening dialectic of the &quot;Logic&quot;, Hegel claims to display that the thought of &quot;&quot;being, pure being&quot; – without further determination&quot; is indistinguishable from the concept of &quot;nothing&quot;, and that, in this &quot;passing back and forth&quot; of being and nothing, &quot;&quot;each&quot; immediately &quot;vanishes in its opposite.&quot;&quot; This movement is neither one concept nor the other, but the category of &quot;becoming&quot;. There is not a difference here to which one can &quot;refer,&quot; only a dialectic that one can observe and describe.

The final category of the &quot;Logic&quot; is &quot;the idea.&quot; As with &quot;the concept&quot;, the sense of this term for Hegel is not psychological. Rather, following Kant in &quot;The Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, Hegel&#x27;s usage harks back to the Greek &quot;eidos&quot;, Plato&#x27;s concept of form that is fully existent and universal: &quot;Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Idee&quot; (like Plato&#x27;s idea) is the product of an attempt to fuse ontology, epistemology, evaluation, etc., into a single set of concepts.&quot;

The &quot;Logic&quot; accommodates within itself the necessity of the realm of natural-spiritual &quot;contingency&quot;, that which cannot be determined in advance: &quot;To go further, it must abandon thinking altogether and let itself go, opening itself to that which is other than thought in pure receptivity.&quot; Simply put, logic realizes itself only in the domain of nature and spirit, in which it attains its &quot;verification.&quot; Hence the conclusion of the &quot;Science of Logic&quot; with &quot;the idea &quot;freely discharging&quot; [entläßt] itself&quot; into &quot;objectivity and external life&quot; – and, so too, the systematic transition to the &quot;Realphilosophie&quot;.

=== Philosophy of the real ===
In contrast to the first, logical part of Hegel&#x27;s system, the second, real-philosophical part – the philosophy of nature and of spirit – is an ongoing project with respect to its historical content, which continues to change and develop. For instance, although Hegel regards &quot;the basic structure&quot; of the philosophy of nature as complete, he was &quot;aware that science is not &#x27;finished&#x27; and will continue to make new discoveries&quot;. Philosophy is, as Hegel puts it, &quot;&quot;its own time comprehended in thoughts&quot;.&quot;

He expands upon this definition:

A further word on the subject of &quot;issuing instructions&quot; on how the world ought to be: philosophy, at any rate, always comes too late to perform this function. As the &quot;thought&quot; of the world, it appears only at a time when actuality has gone through its formative process and attained its completed state [&quot;sich fertig gemacht&quot;]. This lesson of the concept is necessarily also apparent from history, namely that it is only when actuality [&quot;Wirklichkeit&quot;] has reached maturity that the ideal appears opposite the real and reconstructs this real world, which it has grasped in its substance, in the shape of an intellectual realm. When philosophy paints its gray in gray, a shape of life has grown old, and it cannot be rejuvenated, but only recognized, by the gray in gray of philosophy; the owl of Minerva begins its flight only with the onset of dusk.

This frequently has been read as an expression of the impotence of philosophy, political or otherwise, and a rationalization of the status quo. Scholar Allegra de Laurentiis, however, points out that the German expression &quot;sich fertig machen&quot;, translated as &quot;getting ready&quot; or &quot;to get ready&quot;, does not only imply completion, but also preparedness. This additional meaning is important because it better reflects Hegel&#x27;s Aristotelian concept of actuality. He characterizes actuality as being-at-work-staying-itself that can never be once-and-for-all completed or finished.

Hegel describes the relationship between the logical and the real-philosophical parts of his system in this way: &quot;If philosophy does not stand above its time in content, it does so in form, because, as the thought and knowledge of that which is the substantial spirit of its time, it makes that spirit its object.&quot;

This is to say that what makes the philosophy of the real &quot;scientific&quot; in Hegel&#x27;s technical sense is the systematically coherent logical form it uncovers in its natural-historical material – and so also displays in its presentation.

=== &quot;The Philosophy of Nature&quot; ===
The philosophy of nature organizes the contingent material of the natural sciences systematically. As part of the philosophy of the real, in no way does it presume to &quot;tell nature what it must be like.&quot; Historically, various interpreters have questioned Hegel&#x27;s understanding of the natural sciences of his time. However, this claim has been largely refuted by recent scholarship.

One of the very few ways in which the philosophy of nature might correct claims made by the natural sciences themselves is to combat reductive explanations; that is, to discredit accounts employing categories not adequate to the complexity of the phenomena they purport to explain, as for instance, attempting to explain life in strictly chemical terms.

Although Hegel and other &quot;Naturphilosophen&quot; aim to revive a teleological understanding of nature, they argue that their strictly &quot;internal&quot; or &quot;immanent&quot; concept of teleology is &quot;limited to the ends observable within nature itself.&quot; Hence, they claim, it does not violate the Kantian critique. Even more strongly, Hegel and Schelling claim that Kant&#x27;s restriction of teleology to regulative status effectively undermines his own critical project of explaining the possibility of knowledge. Their argument is that &quot;only under the assumption that &quot;there is&quot; an organism is it possible to explain the &quot;actual interaction&quot; between the subjective and the objective, the ideal and the real.&quot; Hence the organism must be acknowledged to have constitutive status.

Introducing Hegel&#x27;s philosophy of nature for a 21st-century audience, observes that &quot;contemporary philosophy of science&quot; has lost sight of &quot;the ontological issue at stake, namely, the question of an intrinsically lawful nature&quot;: &quot;Consider, for example, the problem of what constitutes a law of nature. This problem is central to our understanding of nature. Yet philosophy of science has not provided a definitive response to it up to now. Nor can we expect to have such an answer from that quarter in future.&quot; It is back to Hegel that Wandschneider would direct philosophers of science for guidance in the philosophy of nature.

Recent scholars have also argued that Hegel&#x27;s approach to the philosophy of nature provides valuable resources for theorizing and confronting recent environmental challenges entirely unforeseen by Hegel. These philosophers point to such aspects of his philosophy as its distinctive metaphysical grounding and the continuity of its conception of the nature-spirit relationship.

=== &quot;The Philosophy of Spirit&quot; ===
The German &quot;Geist&quot; has a wide range of meanings. In its most general Hegelian sense, however, &quot;&quot;Geist&quot; denotes the human mind and its products, in contrast to nature and also the logical idea.&quot; (Some older translations render it as &quot;mind,&quot; rather than &quot;spirit.&quot;)

As is especially evident in the Anthropology, Hegel&#x27;s concept of spirit is an appropriation and transformation of the self-referential Aristotelian concept of &quot;energeia&quot;. Spirit is not something above or otherwise external to nature. It is &quot;the highest organization and development&quot; of nature&#x27;s powers.

According to Hegel, &quot;the &quot;essence&quot; of spirit is &quot;freedom&quot;.&quot; The &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; Philosophy of Spirit charts the progressively determinate stages of this freedom until spirit fulfills the Delphic imperative with which Hegel begins: &quot;&quot;Know thyself&quot;.&quot;

As becomes clear, Hegel&#x27;s concept of freedom is not (or not merely) the capacity for arbitrary choice, but has as its &quot;core notion&quot; that &quot;something, especially a person, is free if and only if, it is independent and self-determining, not determined by or dependent upon something other than itself.&quot; It is, in other words, (at least predominantly, dialectically) an account of what Isaiah Berlin would later term positive liberty.

==== Subjective spirit ====
Standing at the transition from nature to spirit, the role of the Philosophy of Subjective Spirit is to analyze &quot;the elements necessary for or presupposed by such relations [of objective spirit], namely, the structures characteristic of and necessary to the individual rational agent.&quot; It does this by elaborating &quot;the fundamental nature of the biological/spiritual human individual along with the cognitive and the practical prerequisites of human social interaction.&quot;

This section, particularly its first part, contains various comments that were commonplace in Hegel&#x27;s day and can now be recognized as openly racist, such as unfounded claims about the &quot;naturally&quot; lower intellectual and emotional development of Black people. In his perspective, these racial differences are related to &quot;climate&quot;: according to Hegel, it is not racial characteristics, but the climactic conditions in which a people lives that variously limit or enable its capacity for free self-determination. He believes that race is not destiny: any group could, in principle, improve and transform its condition by migrating to friendlier climes.

Hegel divides his philosophy of the subjective spirit into three parts: anthropology, phenomenology, and psychology. Anthropology &quot;deals with &#x27;soul&#x27;, which is spirit still mired in nature: all that within us which precedes our self-conscious mind or intellect.&quot; In the section &quot;Phenomenology&quot;, Hegel examines the relation between consciousness and its object and the emergence of intersubjective rationality. Psychology &quot;deals with a great deal that would be categorized as epistemology (or &#x27;theory of knowledge&#x27;) today. Hegel discusses, among other things, the nature of attention, memory, imagination and judgement.&quot;

Throughout this section, but especially in the Anthropology, Hegel appropriates and develops Aristotle&#x27;s hylomorphic approach to what is today theorized as the mind–body problem: &quot;The solution to the mind–body problem [according to this theory] hinges upon recognizing that mind does not act upon the body as cause of effects but rather acts upon itself as an embodied living subjectivity. As such, mind develops itself, progressively attaining more and more of a self-determined character.&quot;

Its final section, Free Spirit, develops the concept of &quot;free will,&quot; which is foundational for Hegel&#x27;s philosophy of right.

==== Objective spirit ====
In the broadest terms, Hegel&#x27;s philosophy of objective spirit &quot;is his social philosophy, his philosophy of how the human spirit objectifies itself in its social and historical activities and productions.&quot; Or, put differently, it is an account of the institutionalization of freedom. Besier declares this a rare instance of unanimity in Hegel scholarship: &quot;all scholars agree there is no more important concept in Hegel&#x27;s political theory than freedom.&quot; This is because it is the foundation of right, the essence of spirit, and the &quot;telos&quot; of history.

This part of Hegel&#x27;s philosophy is presented first in his 1817 &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; (revised 1827 and 1830) and then at greater length in the 1821 &quot;Elements of the Philosophy of Right, or Natural Law and Political Science in Outline&quot; (like the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;, intended as a textbook), upon which he also frequently lectured. Its final part, the philosophy of world history, was additionally elaborated in Hegel&#x27;s lectures on the subject.

Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Elements of the Philosophy of Right&quot; has been controversial from the date of its original publication. It is not, however, a straightforward defense of the autocratic Prussian state, as some have alleged, but is rather a defense of &quot;Prussia as it was to have become under [proposed] reform administrations.&quot;

The German &quot;Recht&quot; in Hegel&#x27;s title does not have a direct English equivalent (though it does correspond to the Latin &quot;ius&quot; and the French &quot;droit&quot;). As a first approximation, Michael Inwood distinguishes three senses:

*a right, claim or title
*justice (as in, e.g., &#x27;to administer justice&#x27;...but not justice as a virtue...)
*&#x27;the law&#x27; as a principle, or &#x27;the laws&#x27; collectively.

Beiser observes that Hegel&#x27;s theory is &quot;his attempt to rehabilitate the natural law tradition while taking into account the criticisms of the historical school.&quot; He adds that &quot;without a sound interpretation of Hegel&#x27;s theory of natural law, we have very little understanding of the very foundation of his social and political thought.&quot; Consistent with Beiser&#x27;s position, scholar Adriaan T. Peperzak documents Hegel&#x27;s arguments against social contract theory and stresses the metaphysical foundations of Hegel&#x27;s philosophy of right.

Observing that &quot;analyzing the structure of Hegel&#x27;s argument in the &quot;Philosophy of Right&quot; shows that achieving political autonomy is fundamental to Hegel&#x27;s analysis of the state and government,&quot; philosopher Kenneth R. Westphal provides this brief outline:

*Abstract Right,&#x27; treats principles governing property, its transfer, and wrongs against property.&quot;
*Morality,&#x27; treats the rights of moral subjects, responsibility for one&#x27;s actions, and a priori theories of right.&quot;
*Ethical Life&#x27; (&quot;Sittlichkeit&quot;), analyzes the principles and institutions governing central aspects of rational social life, including the family, civil society, and the state as a whole, including the government.&quot;

Hegel describes the state of his time, a constitutional monarchy, as rationally embodying three cooperative and mutually inclusive elements. These elements are &quot;democracy (rule of the many, who are involved in legislation), aristocracy (rule of the few, who apply, concretize, and execute the laws), and monarchy (rule of the one, who heads and encompasses all power).&quot; It is what Aristotle called a &quot;mixed&quot; form of government, which is designed to include what is best of each of the three classical forms. The division of powers &quot;prevents an single power from dominating others.&quot; Hegel is particularly concerned to bind the monarch to the constitution, limiting his authority so that he can do little more than to declare of what his ministers have already decided that it is to be so.

The relation of Hegel&#x27;s philosophy of right to modern liberalism is complex. He sees liberalism as a valuable and characteristic expression of the modern world. However, it carries the danger within itself to undermine its own values. This self-destructive tendency may be avoided by measuring &quot;the subjective goals of individuals by a larger objective and collective good.&quot; Moral values, then, have only a &quot;limited place in the total scheme of things.&quot; Yet, although it is not without reason that Hegel is widely regarded as a major proponent of what Isaiah Berlin would later term positive liberty, he was just as &quot;unwavering and unequivocal&quot; in his defense of negative liberty.

If Hegel&#x27;s ideal sovereign is much weaker than was typical in monarchies his time, so too is his democratic element much weaker than is typical in democracies of modern times. Although he insists upon the importance of public participation, Hegel severely limits suffrage and follows the English bicameral model, in which only members of the lower house, that of commoners and bourgeoisie, are elected officials. Nobles in the upper house, like the monarch, inherit their positions.

The final part of the Philosophy of Objective Spirit is entitled &quot;World History.&quot; In this section, Hegel argues that &quot;this immanent principle [the Stoic &quot;logos&quot;] produces with logical inevitability an expansion of the species&#x27; capacities for self determination (&#x27;freedom&#x27;) and a deepening of its self understanding (&#x27;self-knowing&#x27;).&quot; In Hegel&#x27;s own words: &quot;World history is progress in the consciousness of freedom – a progress that we must comprehend conceptually.&quot;

==== Absolute spirit ====

Hegel&#x27;s use of the term &quot;absolute&quot; is easily misunderstood. Inwood, however, clarifies: derived from the Latin &quot;absolutus&quot;, it means &quot;not dependent on, conditional on, relative to or restricted by anything else; self-contained, perfect, complete.&quot; For Hegel, this means that absolute knowing can only denote &quot;an &#x27;absolute relation&#x27; in which the ground of experience and the experiencing agent are one and the same: the object known is explicitly the subject who knows.&quot; That is, the only &quot;thing&quot; (which is really an activity) that is truly absolute is that which is entirely self-conditioned, and, according to Hegel, this only occurs when spirit takes itself up as its own object. The final section of his Philosophy of Spirit presents the three modes of such absolute knowing: art, religion, and philosophy.

It is with reference to different modalities of consciousness – intuition, representation, and comprehending thinking – that Hegel distinguishes the three modes of absolute knowing. Frederick Beiser summarizes: &quot;art, religion and philosophy all have the same object, the absolute or truth itself; but they consist in different forms of knowledge of it. Art presents the absolute in the form of immediate intuition (&quot;Anschauung&quot;); religion presents it in the form of representation (&quot;Vorstellung&quot;); and philosophy presents it in the form of concepts (&quot;Begriffe&quot;).&quot;

The scholar Rüdiger Bubner additionally clarifies that the increase in conceptual transparency according to which these spheres are systematically ordered is not hierarchical in any evaluative sense.

Although Hegel&#x27;s discussion of absolute spirit in the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; is quite brief, he develops his account at length in lectures on the philosophy of fine art, the philosophy of religion, and the history of philosophy.

== Philosophy of art ==


In the &quot;Phenomenology&quot;, and even in the 1817 edition of the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;, Hegel discusses art only as it figures in what he terms the &quot;Art-Religion&quot; of the ancient Greeks. In 1818, however, Hegel begins lecturing on the philosophy of art as an explicitly autonomous domain.

Although H. G. Hotho titled his edition of the Lectures &quot;Vorlesungen über die Ästhetik&quot; [&quot;Lectures on Aesthetics&quot;], Hegel directly states that his topic is not &quot;the spacious realm of the beautiful,&quot; but &quot;art, or, rather, fine art.&quot; He doubles down on this in the next paragraph by explicitly distinguishing his project from the broader philosophical projects pursued under the heading of &quot;aesthetics&quot; by Christian Wolff and Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten.

Some critics – most canonically, Benedetto Croce, in 1907 – have attributed to Hegel some form of the thesis that art is &quot;dead.&quot; Hegel, however, never said any such thing, nor can such a view be plausibly attributed to him. Indeed, one commentator places that debate in perspective with the observation that Hegel&#x27;s claim that &quot;art no longer serves our highest aims&quot; is &quot;radical not for the suggestion that art now fails to do so but for the suggestion that it ever did.&quot;

Hegel&#x27;s detailed and systematic treatment of the various arts over such a great span has even led art historian Ernst Gombrich to present Hegel as &quot;the father of art history.&quot; For most of their history, Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Lectures&quot; were largely ignored by philosophers and received most of their attention from literary critics and art historians.

The more narrowly conceptual project of the philosophy of art, however, is to articulate and defend &quot;the &quot;autonomy&quot; of art, making possible an account of the &quot;special individuality&quot; distinguishing works of aesthetic worth.&quot;

According to Hegel, artistic beauty reveals absolute truth through perception.&#x27; He holds that the best art conveys metaphysical knowledge by revealing, through sense perception, what is unconditionally true,&quot; that is, &quot;what his metaphysical theory affirms to be unconditional or absolute.&quot; So, while Hegel &quot;ennobles art insofar as it conveys metaphysical knowledge,&quot; &quot;he tempers his assessment in view of his belief that art&#x27;s sensory media can never adequately convey what completely transcends the contingency of sensation.&quot; This is why, according to Hegel, art can only be one of three mutually complementary modes of absolute spirit.

== Christianity ==
Although his understanding of Christianity evolved over time, Hegel identified as a Lutheran his entire life. One constant was his profound appreciation for the Christian insight into the intrinsic worth and freedom of every individual.

=== Early Romantic writings ===
Hegel&#x27;s earliest writings on Christianity date between 1783 and 1800. He was still working out his ideas at this time, and everything from this period was abandoned as fragments or unfinished drafts. Hegel was very much dissatisfied with the dogmatism and positivity of the Christian religion, to which he opposed the spontaneous religion of the Greeks. In &quot;The Spirit of Christianity&quot;, he proposes a sort of resolution by aligning the universality of Kantian moral philosophy with the universality of the teachings of Jesus; in paraphrase: &quot;The moral principle of the Gospel is charity, or love, and love is the beauty of the heart, a spiritual beauty which combines the Greek Soul and Kant&#x27;s Moral Reason.&quot; Although he did not return to this Romantic formulation, the unification of Greek and Christian thought would remain a preoccupation throughout his life.

=== &quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; ===

Religion is a major theme throughout the 1807 &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; well before it emerges as the explicit topic of the penultimate Religion chapter. This is seen most directly in the metaphysical &quot;unhappiness&quot; of the Augustinian consciousness in chapter IV and in Hegel&#x27;s depiction of the struggle of the Church of the Faithful with Enlightenment philosophes in chapter VI.

Hegel&#x27;s proper account of Christianity, however, is to be found in the final section of the &quot;Phenomenology&quot; just prior to the closing chapter, Absolute Knowing. It is presented under the heading The Revelatory Religion [&quot;die offenbare Religion&quot;]. By means of philosophical exposition of Christian doctrines such as Incarnation and Resurrection, Hegel claims to demonstrate or to make &quot;manifest&quot; the conceptual truth of Christianity, and so to overcome what has only been positively revealed [&quot;geöffenbarte&quot;] by explication of its underlying, revelatory truth.

The heart of Hegel&#x27;s interpretation of Christianity can be seen in his interpretation of the Trinity. God the Father must give Himself existence as finitely human Son, the death of whom discloses His essential being as Spirit – and, crucially, according to Hegel, his [Hegel&#x27;s] own philosophical &quot;concept&quot; of spirit makes transparent what is only obscurely &quot;represented&quot; in the Christian concept of the Trinity. And so it makes manifest the philosophical &quot;truth&quot; of religion, which now is &quot;known&quot;.

In an essay on the &quot;Phenomenology&quot;, George di Giovanni contrasts Kant&#x27;s rational faith with Hegel&#x27;s rational religion. On his view, the modern role of religion consists in &quot;expressing and nurturing spirit in its most individual forms&quot; rather than in explaining reality. There is no longer any place for faith in opposition to knowledge. Instead, faith assumes such forms as the trust placed &quot;in individuals close to us, or in the time and place in which we happen to live.&quot;

In other words, according to Hegel&#x27;s philosophical interpretation, Christianity does not require faith in any doctrine that is not fully justified by reason. What is left, then, is the religious community, free to minister to individual needs and to celebrate the absolute freedom of spirit.

=== The Berlin lectures ===
Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; includes a section on the Revealed Religion, but it is quite short. It is his Berlin Lectures that contain his next presentation of Christianity, which he variously refers to as the &quot;consummate,&quot; &quot;absolute,&quot; or &quot;revelatory&quot; religion (all equivalent terms in this context). Transcripts of three of Hegel&#x27;s four courses have been preserved, and they show him to be continually adjusting his emphases and exposition. The interpretation of Christianity that he advances, however, is still very much that which he presented in the &quot;Phenomenology&quot; – only now he is able to expound at greater length and with greater clarity upon what he had covered earlier in such a condensed fashion.

=== Issues of interpretation ===

Walter Jaeschke questions whether Luther would have recognized Hegel&#x27;s claim to Protestantism. Hegel embraces the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers with his concept of spirit, but rejects the core Lutheran doctrines of &quot;sola gratia&quot; and &quot;sola scriptura&quot;. Instead, he affirms as the &quot;fundamental principle&quot; of Protestantism &quot;the obstinacy that does honor to mankind, to refuse to recognize in conviction anything not ratified by thought.&quot; On similar grounds, Frederick Beiser, while acknowledging Hegel&#x27;s apparently sincere profession of Lutheranism, describes Hegel&#x27;s theology as effectively &quot;the very opposite of Luther&#x27;s.&quot;

Discussing the &quot;Hegel Renaissance&quot; in late 20th-century Anglo-American philosophy, Beiser expresses surprise – given today&#x27;s highly secular academic culture – at such a surge of interest in Hegel. For, according to Hegel, the divine is the centerpoint of philosophy. Hegel&#x27;s concept of God differs from theistic conceptions found in orthodox Christianity and from deistic conceptions suggested by eighteenth-century philosophers. Nonetheless, Hegel conceptualizes God as the infinite or absolute, in agreement with the classical definition given by St. Anselm as &quot;that of which nothing greater can be conceived.&quot;

Just how to most properly characterize Hegel&#x27;s distinctive articulation of Christianity was a matter of intense debate even in his own life and, among his students, after his death. So it is likely to remain. Neither theistic, nor deistic, Hegel&#x27;s god can only be articulated in the philosophical terms of the concept of spirit or his own distinctive logical vocabulary. Nevertheless, Hegel everywhere insists that his is the Christian God.

==Philosophy of history==
&quot;History,&quot; Frederick Beiser writes, &quot;is central to Hegel&#x27;s conception of philosophy.&quot; Philosophy is only possible &quot;if it is historical, only if the philosopher is aware of the origins, context, and development of his doctrines.&quot; In this 1993 essay, titled &quot;Hegel&#x27;s Historicism,&quot; Beiser declares this to be &quot;nothing less than a revolution in the history of philosophy.&quot; In a 2011 monograph, however, Beiser excludes Hegel from his treatment of the German historicist tradition for the reason that Hegel is more interested in the philosophy of history than in the epistemological project of justifying its status as a science. Moreover, against the relativistic implications of historicism narrowly construed, Hegel&#x27;s metaphysics of spirit supplies a &quot;telos&quot;, internal to history itself, in terms of which progress can be measured and assessed. This is the self-consciousness of freedom. The more that awareness of this essential freedom of spirit permeates a culture, the more advanced Hegel claims it to be.

Because freedom, according to Hegel, is the essence of spirit, the developing self-awareness of this is just as much a development in truth as it is in political life. Thinking presupposes an &quot;instinctive belief&quot; in truth, and the history of philosophy, as recounted by Hegel, is a progressive sequence of &quot;system-identifying&quot; concepts of truth.

Whether or not Hegel is a historicist simply depends upon how one defines the term. The importance of history in Hegel&#x27;s philosophy, however, cannot be denied.

German has two words for &quot;history,&quot; &quot;Historie&quot; and &quot;Geschichte&quot;. The first refers to &quot;the narrative organization of empirical material.&quot; The second &quot;includes an account of the underlying developmental logic (the &#x27;intrinsic ground&#x27;) of deeds and events.&quot; Only the latter procedure can supply a properly universal or philosophical history, and this is the procedure Hegel adopts in all of his historical writings. According to Hegel, humans are distinctly historical creatures because, not only do they exist in time, they also internalize temporal events so that they become, in a profound sense, part of what and who people are, &quot;integral to humanity&#x27;s self-understanding and self-knowledge.&quot; This is why the history of philosophy, for instance, is integral to philosophy itself, it being literally impossible for early philosophers to think what later philosophers, afforded all the riches of their predecessors, could think – and perhaps, with this distance, work through more thoroughly or consistently. From a later perspective, for instance, it becomes apparent that the concept of personhood includes the implication of universality such as renders contradictory any interpretation or implementation that extends it to some people, but not to others.

In the Introduction to his &quot;Lectures on the Philosophy of World History&quot;, simplifying his own account, Hegel divides human history into three epochs. In what he calls the &quot;Oriental&quot; world, &quot;one&quot; person (the pharaoh or emperor) was free. In the Greco-Roman world, &quot;some&quot; people (moneyed citizens) were free. In the &quot;Germanic&quot; world (that is, European Christendom) &quot;all&quot; persons are free.

In his discussion of the ancient world, Hegel provides a heavily qualified defense of slavery. As he puts it elsewhere, &quot;slavery occurs in a transitional phase between the natural human existence and the truly ethical condition; it occurs in a world where a wrong is still right. Here, the wrong &quot;is valid&quot;, so that the position it occupies is a necessary one.&quot; Hegel is clear, however, that there is an unconditional moral demand to reject the institution of slavery, and that slavery is incompatible with the rational state and the essential freedom of every individual.

Some commentators – most notably, Alexandre Kojève and Francis Fukuyama – have understood Hegel to claim that, having achieved a fully universal concept of freedom, history is complete, that it has reached its conclusion. Against this, however, it can be objected that freedom may yet be expanded in terms both of its &quot;scope&quot; and its &quot;content&quot;. Since Hegel&#x27;s day, the scope of the concept of freedom has been expanded to acknowledge the rightful inclusion of women, formerly enslaved or colonized peoples, the mentally ill, and those who do not conform to conservative norms with respect to sexual preference or gender identity, among others. As to the content of freedom, the United Nations&#x27; International Bill of Human Rights, just for instance, expands the concept of freedom beyond what Hegel himself articulates. Additionally, although Hegel consistently presents his philosophical histories as East-to-West narratives, scholars such as J. M. Fritzman argue that, not only is this prejudice quite incidental to the substance of Hegel&#x27;s philosophical position, but that – with India now the world&#x27;s largest democracy, for instance, or with South Africa&#x27;s mighty efforts to transcend apartheid – the movement of freedom back to the East may already have begun.

==Dialectics, speculation, idealism==
Hegel is often credited with proceeding according to a &quot;dialectical method&quot;; in point of fact, however, Hegel characterizes his philosophy as &quot;speculative&quot; (&quot;spekulativ&quot;), rather than dialectical, and uses the term &quot;dialectical&quot; only &quot;quite rarely&quot;. This is because, although &quot;&quot;Dialektik&quot; sometimes stands for the entire movement of the self-articulation of meaning or thought, this term refers more specifically to the self-negation of the determinations of the understanding (&quot;Verstand&quot;), when they are thought through in their fixedness and opposition.&quot;

By contrast, &quot;Hegel describes correct thinking as the methodical interplay of three moments[:] 
:(a) abstract and intellectual (&quot;verständig&quot;), 
:(b) dialectical or negatively rational (&quot;negativvernünftig&quot;), and 
:(c) speculative or positively rational (&quot;positivvernünftig&quot;).&quot;

For example, self-consciousness is &quot;the concept that consciousness has of itself. Thus in this case concept and referent coincide:... &#x27;self-consciousness&#x27; refers to mind&#x27;s taking on the self-contradictory (and thus also self-negating) role of being subject and object of one and the same act of cognition – simultaneously and in the same respect.&quot; Hence it is a speculative concept.

According to Beiser, &quot;if Hegel has any methodology at all, it appears to be an anti-methodology, a method to suspend all methods.&quot; Hegel&#x27;s term &quot;dialectic&quot; must be understood with reference to the &quot;concept&quot; of the object of investigation. What must be grasped is &quot;the &#x27;self-organization&#x27; of the subject matter, its &#x27;inner necessity&#x27; and &#x27;inherent movement. Hegel renounces all external methods such as could be &quot;applied&quot; to some subject matter.

The dialectical character of Hegel&#x27;s speculative procedure often makes his position on any given issue quite difficult to characterize. Instead of seeking to answer a question or solve a problem directly, he frequently recasts it by showing, for instance, &quot;how the dichotomy underlying the dispute is false, and that it is therefore possible to integrate elements from both positions.&quot; Speculative thought preserves what is true from apparently opposing theories in a process that Hegel terms &quot;sublation&quot;.

To &quot;sublate&quot; (&quot;aufheben&quot;) has three main senses:
*&#x27;to raise, to hold, lift up&#x27;;
*&#x27;to annul, abolish, destroy, cancel, suspend&#x27;; and,
*&#x27;to keep, save, preserve.&#x27;

Hegel generally uses the term in all three senses, with particular emphasis on the second and third, in which apparent contradictions are speculatively overcome. His word for what is sublated is &quot;moment&quot; (&quot;das Moment&quot;, in the neuter), which denotes &quot;an essential feature or aspect of a whole conceived as a static system, and an essential phase in a whole conceived as a dialectical movement or process.&quot; (When Hegel describes something as &quot;contradictory,&quot; what he means is that it is not independently self-sustaining on its own terms, and so it can only be comprehended [&quot;begreifen&quot;] as a moment of a larger whole.)

According to Hegel, to think of the finite as a moment of the whole, rather than an independently self-determined existent, is what it means to grasp it as idealized (&quot;das Ideelle&quot;). Idealism, then, &quot;is the doctrine that finite entities are ideal (&quot;ideell&quot;): they depend not on themselves for their existence but on some larger self-sustaining entity [i.e., the whole] that underlies or embraces them.&quot;

The pronoun-expressions – moment, sublate, and idealize – are characteristic of Hegel&#x27;s account of idealism. They can be understood as stages of thought in which the &quot;object is conceptually present first in mere adumbration, then according to circumstances both internal and external to it, and finally standing completely on its own.&quot; This phenomenological and conceptual analysis distinguishes Hegel&#x27;s idealism from Kant&#x27;s transcendental idealism and Berkeley&#x27;s mentalistic idealism. In contrast to those positions, Hegel&#x27;s idealism is entirely compatible with realism and non-mechanistic naturalism. This position rejects empiricism as an a priori account of knowledge, but it is in no way opposed to the philosophical legitimacy of empirical knowledge. Hegel&#x27;s idealistic contention, which he claims to demonstrate, is that &quot;being itself&quot; is rational.

Although it is not incorrect to refer to Hegel&#x27;s philosophy as &quot;absolute idealism,&quot; this moniker was at the time more associated with Schelling, and Hegel himself is documented as employing it with reference to his own philosophy only three times.

According to Hegel, &quot;every philosophy is essentially idealism.&quot; This claim is based on the assumption, which Hegel claims to demonstrate, that conceptualization is present at all cognitive levels. For to completely deny this would undermine trust in the conceptual capacities necessary for objective knowledge—and so would lead to total skepticism. Hence, according to Robert Stern, Hegel&#x27;s idealism, &quot;amounts to a form of &quot;conceptual realism&quot;, understood as &#x27;the belief that concepts are part of the structure of reality.

=== Thesis–antithesis–synthesis ===
This terminology, largely developed earlier by Fichte, was spread by Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus in accounts of Hegel&#x27;s philosophy that have since been broadly discredited. Walter Kaufmann, for instance, reports:

Fichte introduced into German philosophy the three-step of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, using these three terms. Schelling took up this terminology. &quot;Hegel did not.&quot; He never once used these three terms together to designate three stages in an argument or account in any of his books. And they do not help us understand his &quot;Phenomenology&quot;, his &quot;Logic&quot;, or his philosophy of history; they impede any open-minded comprehension of what he does by forcing it into a scheme which was available to him and which he deliberately spurned.

More modestly, it has been said that this account is &quot;only a partial comprehension that requires correction.&quot; What it gets right is that, according to Hegel, &quot;truth emerges from error&quot; in the course of historical development in a way that implies a &quot;holism in which partial truths are progressively corrected so that their one-sidedness is overcome.&quot; What it distorts is that such a description is possible only after the process has unfolded. The &quot;thesis&quot; and &quot;antithesis&quot; are not &quot;alien&quot; to one another. Inasmuch as there can be said to be such a &quot;dialectical method,&quot; it is not an external one such as could be &quot;applied&quot; to some subject matter.

Similarly, Stephen Houlgate argues that, in whatever limited sense Hegel might be said to have a &quot;method,&quot; it is a strictly &quot;immanent&quot; method; that is, it emerges from thoughtful immersion in the subject-matter itself. If this leads to dialectics, that is only because there is a contradiction in the object itself, not because of any external methodological procedure.

== Legacy ==
Hegel&#x27;s influence on subsequent philosophical developments has been enormous. In late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century England, a school known as British idealism propounded a version of absolute idealism in direct engagement with Hegel&#x27;s texts. Prominent members included J. M. E. McTaggart, R. G. Collingwood, and G. R. G. Mure. Separately, some philosophers such as Marx, Dewey, Derrida, Adorno, and Gadamer have selectively developed Hegelian ideas into their own philosophical programs. Others have developed their positions in opposition to Hegel&#x27;s system. These include, for instance, such diverse philosophers as Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Russell, G. E. Moore, and Foucault. In theology, Hegel&#x27;s influence marks the work of Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer. These names, however, constitute only a small sample of some of the more important figures who have developed their thought in engagement with the philosophy of Hegel.

=== &quot;Right&quot; vs. &quot;Left&quot; Hegelianism ===

Some historians present Hegel&#x27;s early influence in Germanic philosophy as divided into two opposing camps, right and left. The Right Hegelians, the allegedly direct disciples of Hegel at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität, advocated a Protestant orthodoxy and the political conservatism of the post-Napoleon Restoration period. The Left Hegelians, also known as the Young Hegelians, interpreted Hegel in a revolutionary sense, leading to an advocation of atheism in religion and liberal democracy in politics. Recent studies, however, have questioned this paradigm.

The Right Hegelians &quot;were quickly forgotten&quot; and &quot;today mainly known only to specialists&quot;; the Left Hegelians, by contrast, &quot;included some of the most important thinkers of the period,&quot; and &quot;through their emphasis on practice, some of these thinkers have remained exceedingly influential,&quot; primarily through the Marxist tradition.

Among the first followers to take an expressly critical view of Hegel&#x27;s system were those in the 19th-century German group known as the Young Hegelians, which included Feuerbach, Marx, Engels, and their followers. The primary thrust of their criticism is concisely expressed in the eleventh of Marx&#x27;s &quot;Theses on Feuerbach&quot; from his 1845 &quot;German Ideology&quot;: &quot;The philosophers have only &quot;interpreted&quot; the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to &quot;change&quot; it.&quot;

In the twentieth century, a Hegelian-inflected interpretation of Marx was further developed in the work of critical theorists of the Frankfurt School. This was due to (a) the rediscovery and re-evaluation of Hegel as a possible philosophical progenitor of Marxism by philosophically oriented Marxists; (b) a resurgence of Hegel&#x27;s historical perspective; and (c) an increasing recognition of the importance of his dialectical method. György Lukács&#x27; &quot;History and Class Consciousness&quot; (1923), in particular, helped to reintroduce Hegel into the Marxist canon.

=== In France ===
It has become commonplace to identify &quot;French Hegel&quot; with the lectures of Alexandre Kojève, who emphasized the master-servant [&quot;Herrschaft und Knechtschaft&quot;] dialectic (which he mistranslated as master-slave [&quot;maître et l&#x27;esclave&quot;]) and Hegel&#x27;s philosophy of history. This perspective, however, overlooks over sixty years of French writing on Hegel, according to which Hegelianism was identified with the &quot;system&quot; presented in the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;. The later reading, drawing instead upon the &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;, was in many ways a reaction against the earlier. After 1945, &quot;this &#x27;dramatic&#x27; Hegelianism, which centered on the theme of historical becoming through conflict, [came] to be seen as compatible with existentialism and Marxism.&quot;

By confining the dialectic to history, the dominant French readings of Jean Wahl, Alexandre Kojève, and Jean Hyppolite effectively presented Hegel as providing &quot;a philosophical anthropology instead of a general metaphysics.&quot; This reading took the topic of &quot;desire&quot; as its focal point of intervention. A major theme was that &quot;a reason that seeks to be all-inclusive falsifies reality by suppressing or repressing its &#x27;other. Although it cannot be attributed entirely to Kojève, this reading of Hegel shaped the thought and interpretations of thinkers such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Claude Levi-Strauss, Jacques Lacan, and Georges Bataille.

Kojève&#x27;s interpretation of the &quot;master-slave dialectic&quot; as the basic model of historical development also influenced the feminism of Simone de Beauvoir and the anti-racist and anti-colonial work of Frantz Fanon.

=== American pragmatism ===

As documented by Richard J. Bernstein, the influence of Hegel on American Pragmatism can be divided into three moments: the late nineteenth century, the mid-twentieth, and the present. The first is to be found in early issues of &quot;The Journal of Speculative Philosophy&quot; (founded 1867). The second is evident in the acknowledged influence upon major figures including John Dewey, Charles Peirce, and William James.

As Dewey himself describes the attraction, &quot;There were, however, also &#x27;subjective&#x27; reasons for the appeal that Hegel&#x27;s thought made to me; it supplied a demand for unification that was doubtless an intense emotional craving, and yet was a hunger that only an intellectualized subject-matter could satisfy.&quot; Dewey accepted much of Hegel&#x27;s account of history and society, but rejected his conception of Hegel&#x27;s account of absolute knowing.

Two philosophers, John McDowell and Robert Brandom (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Pittsburgh Hegelians&quot;), constitute, per Bernstein, the third moment of Hegel&#x27;s influence on pragmatism. However, while openly acknowledging the influence, neither claims to explicate Hegel&#x27;s views according to his own self-understanding. In addition, each is avowedly influenced by Wilfrid Sellars. McDowell is particularly interested in dispelling the &quot;myth of the given,&quot; the dichotomy between concept and intuition, whereas Brandom is concerned mostly to develop Hegel&#x27;s social account of reason-giving and normative implication. These appropriations of Hegel&#x27;s thought are two among several &quot;non-metaphysical&quot; readings.

<text>A grid network is a computer network consisting of a number of computer systems connected in a grid topology.

In a regular grid topology, each node in the network is connected with two neighbors along one or more dimensions. If the network is one-dimensional, and the chain of nodes is connected to form a circular loop, the resulting topology is known as a ring. Network systems such as FDDI use two counter-rotating token-passing rings to achieve high reliability and performance. In general, when an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional grid network is connected circularly in more than one dimension, the resulting network topology is a torus, and the network is called &quot;toroidal&quot;. When the number of nodes along each dimension of a toroidal network is 2, the resulting network is called
a hypercube.

A parallel computing cluster or multi-core processor is often connected in regular interconnection network such as a
de Bruijn graph,
a hypercube graph,
a hypertree network,
a fat tree network,
a torus, or cube-connected cycles.

A grid network is not the same as a grid computer or a computational grid, although the nodes in a grid network are usually computers, and grid computing requires some kind of computer network or &quot;universal coding&quot; to interconnect the computers.

<doc id="12601" wikidata="Q610669" url="?curid=12601" title="Governor-General of Australia">
<text>The governor-general of Australia is the federal representative of the monarch of Australia, currently Charles III. The governor-general has many constitutional and ceremonial roles in the Australian political system, in which they have independent agency. However, they are generally bound by convention to act on the advice of the prime minister and the Federal Executive Council. They also have a significant community role, through recognising meritorious individuals and groups, and representing the nation as a whole. The current governor-general is Sam Mostyn.

Significant functions of the governor-general include giving royal assent to bills passed by the houses of parliament, issuing writs for elections, exercising executive power on the advice of the Federal Executive Council, formally appointing government officials (including the prime minister, other ministers, judges and ambassadors), acting as commander-in-chief of the Australian Defence Force, and bestowing Australian honours. However, in almost all instances the governor-general only exercises &quot;de jure&quot; power in accordance with the principles of the Westminster system and responsible government. This requires them to remain politically neutral and to only act in accordance with Parliament (such as when selecting the prime minister and providing royal assent) or on the advice of ministers (when performing executive actions). However, in certain limited circumstances, the governor-general can exercise reserve powers (powers that may be exercised without or against formal advice), most notably during the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis. These situations are often controversial and the use of and continued existence of these powers remains highly debated.

In their ceremonial and community roles, the governor-general represents the nation as a whole. Domestically, this role entails attending services and commemorations, sponsoring community organisations and hosting events at one of the two official residences (Government House in Canberra and Admiralty House in Sydney). Internationally, the governor-general represents Australia by travelling to significant events and by performing and receiving state visits. The governor-general is supported by a staff (of 80 in 2018) headed by the official secretary.

The governor-general is selected by the prime minister, but formally appointed by the monarch of Australia on the prime minister&#x27;s advice. Their term is not fixed, but they typically serve for five years. From Federation in 1901 until 1965, 11 out of the 15 governors-general were British aristocrats; however all since then have been Australian citizens. The current governor-general, Samantha Mostyn, is the second woman to hold the post, after Dame Quentin Bryce (2008–2014).

==Appointment==
The governor-general is formally appointed by the monarch of Australia with a commission made under the authority of section 2 of the Constitution and regulated by letters patent issued by the monarch. When a new governor-general is to be appointed, the current prime minister recommends a name to the monarch, who by convention accepts that recommendation. Prior to the 1940s, the recommendation was made and decided by the Cabinet as a whole. The incoming governor-general is publicly announced usually several months before the end of the existing governor-general&#x27;s term. After receiving their commission, the new governor-general takes an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the monarch and an oath or affirmation of office. These oaths are administered by the chief justice of Australia or another justice of the High Court. Traditionally, the ceremony takes place in the Senate chamber.

=== Tenure ===
The Constitution does not set a term of office, so a governor-general may continue to hold office for any agreed length of time. In recent decades the typical term of office has been five years. Some early governors-general were appointed to terms of just one year (Lord Tennyson) or two years (Lord Forster; later extended). At the end of this initial term, a commission may be extended for a short time, usually to avoid conflict with an election or during political difficulties.

Three governors-general have resigned their commission. The first governor-general, Lord Hopetoun, asked to be recalled to Britain in 1903 over a dispute about funding for the post. Sir John Kerr resigned in 1977, with his official reason being his decision to accept the position of Australian ambassador to UNESCO in Paris, a post which ultimately he did not take up, but the resignation also being motivated by the 1975 constitutional controversy. In 2003, ex-archbishop Peter Hollingworth voluntarily stood aside while controversial allegations against him were managed, and the letters patent of the office were amended to take account of this circumstance. He later stepped down over the church&#x27;s handling of allegations of sexual abuse of boys, for which he apologised before the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in 2016. In 1961, Lord Dunrossil became the first and, to date, only governor-general to die while holding office.

A vacancy occurs on the resignation, death, or incapacity of the governor-general. A temporary vacancy occurs when the governor-general is overseas on official business representing Australia. A temporary vacancy also occurred in 2003 when Peter Hollingworth stood aside.

Section 4 of the Constitution allows the monarch to appoint an administrator to carry out the role of governor-general when there is a vacancy. By convention, the longest-serving state governor holds a dormant commission, allowing an assumption of office to commence whenever a vacancy occurs. In 1975, Labor prime minister Gough Whitlam advised the Queen that Sir Colin Hannah, then governor of Queensland, should have his dormant commission revoked for having made public and partisan anti-Whitlam government political statements, in violation of the convention that vice-regal representatives remain neutral and above politics.

=== Dismissal ===
A governor-general may be recalled or dismissed by the monarch before their term is complete. By convention, this may only be upon advice from the prime minister, who retains responsibility for selecting an immediate replacement or letting the vacancy provisions take effect. The constitutional crisis of 1975 raised the possibility of the prime minister and the governor-general attempting to dismiss each other at the same time. According to William McMahon, Harold Holt considered having Lord Casey dismissed from the governor-generalship, and went as far as to have the necessary documents drawn up. Casey had twice called McMahon into Yarralumla to give him a &quot;dressing down&quot; over his poor relationship with deputy prime minister John McEwen, which he believed was affecting the government. Holt believed that this was an improper use of his authority, but no further action was taken.

==Constitutional role==

The governor-general has a key role in performing constitutional duties in all branches of government.

===Role in the Australian Parliament===
The Constitution defines the Parliament of the Commonwealth as consisting of the monarch, the Senate and the House of Representatives. However, the monarch&#x27;s role is no more than titular, with the governor-general responsible under the Constitution for most of the functions undertaken by the monarch in regard to the UK parliament. These include the power to summon, dissolve and prorogue the Parliament, to issue writs for lower house elections, to convene a joint sitting, as well as the power to give royal assent to bills in the monarch&#x27;s name.

The governor-general also has a ceremonial role in swearing in and accepting the resignations of members of Parliament. All members must make an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the King in the presence of the governor-general or someone appointed by them before they take their seats. On the day parliament opens, the governor-general makes a speech in the Senate (similar to the King&#x27;s Speech in the UK), entirely written by the government, explaining the government&#x27;s proposed legislative program.

One of the most significant powers of the governor-general is the power to grant royal assent in the King&#x27;s name. This assent gives bills that have been passed by the houses of parliament the force of law, with effect either 28 days after being signed, on a date to be fixed later by proclamation or otherwise as provided in the act. The government does not formally advise the governor-general to grant assent, but it is expected that they will act in accordance with the democratically elected houses of Parliament and assent has never been refused.

Apart from assenting to a bill, the governor-general can also reserve a bill for the King&#x27;s pleasure, that is allow the monarch to give royal assent personally to a proposed bill. When the governor-general acted as a representative of the British government, this provision allowed for the governor-general to refer a bill back to the British government for review, which would then advise the monarch whether or not to grant assent. The British government could also advise the monarch to disallow a law passed within the last two years, which would annul the law on the governor-general&#x27;s proclamation or message to the houses. However, since the assumption of full sovereignty and the emergence of an independent Crown of Australia, the British government no longer has these powers and the reservation power has only occasionally been used for bills that affect the monarch personally, such as the &quot;Royal Styles and Titles Act&quot; (1953 and 1973) and other bills of national significance such as the &quot;Flags Act 1953&quot; and the &quot;Australia Act 1986&quot;.

Finally, the governor-general can refer a bill back to the houses with suggested changes. This has only happened when once passed, the government has realised a bill requires further amendment and requests the governor-general return the bill to the house.

===Role in executive government===
Under the Constitution, the executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the monarch, but is exercisable by the governor-general. However, such power is only exercised on the advice of ministers in accordance with the principles of responsible government. This occurs formally through the Federal Executive Council, a body of all current (and technically former) ministers that advises the governor-general. Such advice is generally the result of decisions already made in Cabinet, the &quot;de facto&quot; highest executive body in Australia. While some provisions in the Constitution refer the &quot;Governor-General&quot; and others to the &quot;Governor-General in Council&quot;, this does not mean that there is in element of discretion in the former; this distinction merely indicates that the former powers were those that were historically classified as belonging to the prerogative of the monarch alone.

Many executive powers are also bestowed on the governor-general by statute. This allows the government of the day (acting through the governor-general) to perform certain acts that would otherwise require legislation. Such provision are often made where legislating may be too slow, as for the declaration of emergencies. An example this was the declaration on the advice of the health minister of a human biosecurity emergency under the &quot;Biosecurity Act 2015&quot; in March 2020, due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Formally, the governor-general may exercise the traditional rights of the monarch as identified by Bagehot: the right to be consulted, to encourage and to warn. However, the practical ability to exercise this right is limited. Unlike in Canada or the UK, there is no tradition of regular weekly meetings between the governor-general and the prime minister, with meetings instead sporadically held at the request or either party. There is a greater capacity to exercise influence at the regular meetings of the Federal Executive Council at Government House; however this requires the governor-general to have existing legal experience due to the volume of material, the lack of any requirement for executive-councillors to be briefed or otherwise senior in the government, and the expectation by some governments that the governor-general should only act as a rubber stamp.

===Reserve powers===
The reserve powers are those powers that the governor-general may exercise independently, that is in the absence of or against ministerial advice. While most of these powers are listed in the Constitution, the circumstances in which they can be used with discretion is not prescribed and is a matter of convention.

The reserve powers that are generally accepted are:
* the discretion to select a prime minister if an election results in a parliament in which no party or coalition has a clear majority
* the power to dismiss a prime minister that has lost the support of the House of Representatives
* the power to refuse to dissolve the House of Representatives

The reserve powers that are the subject of greater debate are:

* the power to refuse a double-dissolution
* the power to refuse a prorogation
* the discretion to select a prime minister following the dismissal of a prime minister that has lost the support of the House of Representatives
* the power to dismiss a prime minister who is unable to obtain supply and refuses to resign or advise a dissolution
* the power to dismiss a prime minister that has broken the law
* the power to refuse royal assent

The most prominent use of the reserve powers occurred in the course of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, in which governor-general Sir John Kerr dismissed the government of Gough Whitlam and appointed opposition leader Malcolm Fraser as prime minister while an election was held. Kerr acted following the blocking of supply by the opposition controlled Senate, arguing that this gave him both the right and duty to dismiss the government when they did not resign or advise an election. The event remains one of the most highly debated and controversial in Australian political history.

==Ceremonial role==
In addition to the formal constitutional role, the governor-general has a representative and ceremonial role, though the extent and nature of that role has depended on the expectations of the time, the individual in office at the time, the wishes of the incumbent government, and the individual&#x27;s reputation in the wider community. Governors-general generally become patrons of various charitable institutions, present honours and awards, host functions for various groups of people including ambassadors to and from other countries, and travel widely throughout Australia. Sir William Deane (governor-general 1996–2001) described one of his functions as being &quot;Chief Mourner&quot; at prominent funerals. In &quot;Commentaries on the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia&quot;, Robert Garran wrote that, since the Australian executive is national in nature (being dependent on the nationally elected House of Representatives, rather than the Senate), &quot;the Governor-General, as the official head of the Executive, does not in the smallest degree represent any federal element; if he represents anything he is the image and embodiment of national unity and the outward and visible representation of the Imperial relationship of the Commonwealth&quot;.

That role can become controversial, however, if the governor-general becomes unpopular with sections of the community. The public role adopted by Sir John Kerr was curtailed considerably after the constitutional crisis of 1975; Sir William Deane&#x27;s public statements on political issues produced some hostility towards him; and some charities disassociated themselves from Peter Hollingworth after the issue of his management of sex abuse cases during his time as Anglican archbishop of Brisbane became a matter of controversy.

===Diplomatic role===
The governor-general makes state visits overseas on behalf of Australia, during which an administrator of the government is appointed. The right of governors-general to make state visits was confirmed at the 1926 Imperial Conference, as it was deemed not feasible for the sovereign to pay state visits on behalf of countries other than the United Kingdom. However, an Australian governor-general did not exercise that right until 1971, when Paul Hasluck visited New Zealand. Hasluck&#x27;s successor John Kerr made state visits to eight countries, but Kerr&#x27;s successor Zelman Cowen made only a single state visit – to Papua New Guinea – as he wished to concentrate on travelling within Australia. All subsequent governors-general have travelled widely while in office and made multiple state visits. Occasionally governors-general have made extended tours visiting multiple countries, notably in 2009 when Quentin Bryce visited nine African countries in 19 days.

The governor-general accredits (i.e. formally validates) Australia&#x27;s ambassadors through sending a formal letter of credence (and a letter of recall at the end of a tenure) to heads of state and government and similarly formally receives foreign letters during credentials ceremonies for heads of mission on their arrival in Canberra. Before 1987, ambassador and high commissioner appointments were formally made by the monarch instead.

===Military role===

Under section 68 of the Constitution, the command-in-chief of Australia&#x27;s military forces is &quot;vested in the Governor‑General as the Queen&#x27;s representative&quot;. Views on the effect of this section vary, from merely making the governor-general &quot;in effect no more than a glorified Patron of the Defence Forces&quot; to alternatively making the governor-general the ultimate head of military chain of command who may influence or deny the use of the military if it is to be used for domestic political ends. Ex-governor-general Sir Ninian Stephen stated that his view of the section was that it vests command of the military in the governor-general personally, but only to the extent that the power to give orders or call out the military does not require formal advice from the Federal Executive Council but instead the direct advice of the relevant minister. Other powers exist in the &quot;Defence Force Act 1903&quot;, such as the power to appoint the chief of the Defence Force, to call out the Defence Force, and declare a time of war, exercised as ordinary executive powers on advice. Additionally, all officers are appointed by the governor-general on behalf of the monarch with a personally signed commission.

Historically, the power to declare war and make peace rested with the monarch (as advised by the British government) in their role as head of the British Empire. This was the position of Robert Menzies in 1939, who assumed that the declaration of war by the United Kingdom in World War II automatically applied to Australia. However, in 1941 opinion had shifted and the Curtin government advised the governor-general to declare war on several Axis powers. However, it was still unclear whether the governor-general had the constitutional power to declare war, so in addition to requesting the assignment of powers by the monarch to the governor-general, the government also requested King George VI make similar proclamations of war on Australia&#x27;s behalf. No formal declarations of war have been made since World War II, although other declarations on the start and end of time of &quot;active service&quot; have been made in other conflicts.

The powers of command-in-chief are vested in the governor-general rather than the &quot;Governor-General in Council&quot;, however this does not denote an element of personal discretion in their exercise. However, in 1970 governor-general Paul Hasluck refused prime minister John Gorton&#x27;s request to authorise a Pacific Islands Regiment peacekeeping mission in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, on the grounds that cabinet had not been consulted. Gorton agreed to put the matter to his ministers, and a cabinet meeting agreed that troops should only be called out if requested by the territory&#x27;s administrator; this did not occur. Defence minister Malcolm Fraser, who opposed the call out, was responsible for informing Hasluck of the prime minister&#x27;s lack of consultation. The incident contributed to Fraser&#x27;s resignation from cabinet in 1971 and Gorton&#x27;s subsequent loss of the prime ministership.

==Community role==
The governor-general is generally invited to become patron of various charitable and service organisations. Historically the governor-general has also served as Chief Scout of Australia. The chief scout is nominated by the Scouting Association&#x27;s National Executive Committee and is invited by the president of the Scout Association to accept the appointment. Bill Hayden declined the office on the grounds of his atheism, which was incompatible with the Scout Promise. He did however serve as the association&#x27;s patron during his term of office.

==Relationship with the monarch==

While the governor-general is the monarch&#x27;s representative, as provided by section 2 of the Constitution, the powers they exercise are solely granted by the Constitution. This was not always seen to be the case however, with section 2 also providing that the governor-general may exercise other powers, subject to the Constitution, that the monarch may assign them. Additionally, the initial letters patent of Queen Victoria purported to create and empower the office of governor-general, despite their assignment already in the Constitution. This was raised as early as 1901, by John Quick and Garran in their authoritative commentary of the Constitution, noting that the governor-general of Australia was distinguished from other imperial governors-general by the fact that &quot;[t]he principal and most important of his powers and functions, legislative as well as executive, are expressly conferred on him by the terms of the Constitution itself ... not by Royal authority, but by statutory authority&quot;. This view was also held by Andrew Inglis Clark, senior judge of the Supreme Court of Tasmania, who with W. Harrison Moore (a contributor to the first draft of the constitution put before the 1897 Adelaide Convention and professor of law at the University of Melbourne), postulating that the letters patent and the royal instructions issued by Queen Victoria were unnecessary &quot;or even of doubtful legality&quot;.

Additionally, it was also previously believed that the monarch retained certain powers, such as the power to declare war, appoint diplomatic officers and to grant charters of incorporation and as such these powers were assigned separately to the governor-general under section 2. However, the current interpretation of the Constitution is that all royal prerogatives are exercisable by the governor-general under section 61 and in recognition of this, the vesting of additional powers ended in 1987. While separate letters-patent still exist for the governor-general, these merely provide for the appointment of administrator in the case of the governor-general&#x27;s absence or incapacity and requires the governor-general to make an oath or affirmation of allegiance and one of office.

Commonwealth Solicitor-General Maurice Byers stated in 1974: &quot;The constitutional prescription is that executive power is exercisable by the governor-general although vested in the Queen. What is exercisable is original executive power: that is, the very thing vested in the Queen by section 61. And it is exercisable by the Queen&#x27;s representative, not her delegate or agent.&quot;

The 1988 Constitutional Commission report explained: &quot;the governor-general is in no sense a delegate of the Queen. The independence of the office is highlighted by changes which have been made in recent years to the Royal Instruments relating to it&quot;. The changes occurred in 1984 when Queen Victoria&#x27;s letters patent and instructions were revoked and replaced with new letters patent, on prime minister Bob Hawke&#x27;s advice, who stated that this would clarify the governor-general&#x27;s position under the constitution.

This remains the case even when the sovereign is in the country: solicitor-general Kenneth Bailey, prior to the first tour of Australia by its reigning monarch in 1954, explained the position by saying: 
The monarch did not overturn the actions of governor-general Sir John Kerr in his dismissal of the prime ministership and government of Gough Whitlam during the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, with the Queen&#x27;s private secretary arguing that the power to commission the prime minister was &quot;clearly placed within the jurisdiction of the governor-general, and The Queen has no part in the decisions which the Governor-General must take in accordance with the Constitution&quot;. In an address to the Sydney Institute, January 2007, in connection with that event, Sir David Smith, a retired official secretary to the governor-general of Australia who had been Kerr&#x27;s official secretary in 1975, described the constitution as conferring the powers and functions of Australia&#x27;s head of state on the governor-general in &quot;his own right&quot;. He stated that the governor-general was more than a representative of the sovereign, explaining: &quot;under section 2 of the Constitution the Governor-General is the Queen&#x27;s representative and exercises certain royal prerogative powers and functions; under section 61 of the Constitution the Governor-General is the holder of a quite separate and independent office created, not by the Crown, but by the Constitution, and empowered to exercise, in his own right as Governor-General... all the powers and functions of Australia&#x27;s head of state&quot;.

==Privileges ==
Governors-general are entitled to various privileges by virtue of holding the office. These include the right to live in Government House (also known as Yarralumla), or Admiralty House, Sydney the two official residences of the office-holder. For transportation, the governor-general has access to a Rolls-Royce Phantom VI limousine for ceremonial occasions or an armoured BMW 7 Series for ordinary official business. These cars fly the flag of the governor-general of Australia and display the Tudor Crown instead of number plates. Originally, two Phantoms were available after being purchased in the 1970s to be used for royal tours. One of these cars was sold in 1995 to a Sydney doctor, having previously carried the Queen during a royal tour and later being pelted with eggs when it carried Sir John Kerr following the Dismissal in 1975. The car was then entered into the almost 15,000 km long Peking to Paris rally, where it became known as &quot;Lizzie&#x27;s Taxi&quot; and secured fourth place. The car is now owned by Lindsay Fox and is often on display as a part of the Fox Classic Car Collection at Queens Warehouse, Melbourne.

===Salary===
The salary of the governor-general was initially set by the Constitution, which fixed an annual amount of A£10,000 until the parliament decided otherwise. The Constitution also provides that the salary of the governor-general cannot be changed during their term of office. Their pay is now set by &quot;Governor-General Act 1974&quot;, which has been amended on each new commission to set the governor-general&#x27;s salary to an amount slightly higher than the average salary of the chief justice of the High Court over the next five years. Since 1995, this has been reduced to take into account any existing pension the incoming governor-general currently receives. This provision led to the salary increase of current governor-general Samantha Mostyn (of $495,000 to $709,017) being significantly greater than other new governors-general, as unlike previous governor-general David Hurley, she does not receive a military pension.

The governor-general also receives a generous pension. Until 2001, governors-general did not pay income tax on their salary; this was changed after Elizabeth II agreed to pay tax.

===Official dress===
Governors-general before the 1970s wore traditional court uniforms, consisting of a dark navy wool double-breasted coatee with silver oak leaf and fern embroidery on the collar and cuffs trimmed with silver buttons embossed with the Royal Arms and with bullion edged epaulettes on the shoulders, dark navy trousers with a wide band of silver oak-leaf braid down the outside seam, silver sword belt with ceremonial sword, bicorne cocked hat with plume of ostrich feathers, black patent leather Wellington boots with spurs, etc., that is worn on ceremonial occasions. There is also a tropical version made of white tropical wool cut in a typical military fashion worn with a plumed helmet. However, that custom fell into disuse during the tenure of Sir Paul Hasluck with governors-general now observing informal wear day-to-day. Tasmanian governor Sir Stanley Burbury extensively lobbied his government in an attempt to regain the right to wear a uniform, going as far to contact Sir John Kerr in desperation, hoping he could contact the Palace directly. However, it does not appear that he was successful.

===Titles and honours===
Governors-general have during their tenure the style &quot;His/Her Excellency the Honourable&quot; and their spouses have the style &quot;His/Her Excellency&quot;. Since May 2013, the style used by a former governor-general is &quot;the Honourable&quot;; it was at the same time retrospectively granted for life to all previous holders of the office.

From the creation of the Order of Australia in 1975, the governor-general was, &quot;ex officio&quot;, Chancellor and Principal Companion of the order, and therefore became entitled to the post-nominal AC. In 1976, the letters patent for the order were amended to introduce the rank of Knight and Dame to the order, and from that time the governor-general became, ex officio, the Chancellor and Principal Knight of the order. In 1986 the letters patent were amended again, and governors-general appointed from that time were again, ex officio, entitled to the post-nominal AC (although if they already held a knighthood in the order that superior rank was retained).

Until 1989, all governors-general were members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and thus held the additional style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life. The same individuals were also usually either peers, knights, or both (the only Australian peer to be appointed as governor-general was Lord Casey; and Sir William McKell was knighted only in 1951, some years into his term, but he was entitled to the style &quot;The Honourable&quot; during his tenure as premier of New South Wales, an office he held until almost immediately before his appointment). In 1989, Bill Hayden, a republican, declined appointment to the British Privy Council and any imperial honours. From that time until 2014, governors-general did not receive automatic titles or honours, other than the post-nominal AC by virtue of being Chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order of Australia. Quentin Bryce was the first governor-general to have had no prior title or pre-nominal style. She was in office when, on 19 March 2014, then prime minister Tony Abbott advised the Queen to amend the letters patent of the Order of Australia to reinstate knighthoods into the Order, with the governor-general becoming the Principal Knight or Dame of the order. However, in 2015 knighthoods were once again abolished by new prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, with all subsequent governors-general appointed as Companions.

Spouses of governors-general have no official duties but carry out the role of a vice-regal consort. They are entitled to the courtesy style &quot;Her Excellency&quot; or &quot;His Excellency&quot; during the office-holder&#x27;s term of office. Most spouses of governors-general have been content to be quietly supportive. Some, however, have been notable in their own right, such as Dame Alexandra Hasluck, Lady Casey and Michael Bryce.

==History==
Other offices named &quot;governor-general&quot; were previously used in Australia in the mid-19th century. Sir Charles FitzRoy (governor of New South Wales from 1846 to 1855) and Sir William Denison (governor of New South Wales from 1855 to 1861) also carried the additional title of governor-general because their jurisdiction extended to other colonies in Australia.
The office of governor-general of Australia was conceived during the debates and conventions leading up to federation. The first governor-general, John Hope, 7th Earl of Hopetoun, was a previous governor of Victoria. He was selected in July 1900, returning to Australia shortly before the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901. After the initial confusion of the Hopetoun Blunder, he appointed the first prime minister of Australia, Edmund Barton, to a caretaker government, with the inaugural 1901 federal election not occurring until March.

Early governors-general were British and were appointed by the king on the recommendation of the Colonial Office. The Australian government was merely asked, as a matter of courtesy, whether they approved of the choice or not. Governors-general were expected to exercise a supervisory role over the Australian government in the manner of a colonial governor. In a very real sense, they represented the British government. They had the right to reserve legislation passed by the Parliament of Australia: in effect, to ask the Colonial Office in London for an opinion before giving the royal assent. They exercised this power several times. The monarch, acting upon advice of the British government, could also disallow any Australian legislation up to a year after the governor-general had given it the assent; although this power has never been used. These powers remain in section 59 of the Constitution of Australia, but today are regarded as dead letters.

The early governors-general frequently sought advice on the exercise of their powers from judges of the High Court of Australia, Sir Samuel Griffith and Sir Edmund Barton.

In 1919, prime minister Billy Hughes sent a memorandum to the Colonial Office in which he requested &quot;a real and effective voice in the selection of the King&#x27;s representative&quot;. He further proposed that the Dominions be able to nominate their own candidates and that &quot;the field of selection should not exclude citizens of the Dominion itself&quot;. The memorandum met with strong opposition within the Colonial Office and was dismissed by Lord Milner, the Colonial Secretary; no response was given. The following year, as Ronald Munro Ferguson&#x27;s term was about to expire, Hughes cabled the Colonial Office and asked that the appointment be made in accordance with the memorandum. To mollify Hughes, Milner offered him a choice between three candidates. After consulting his cabinet he chose Henry Forster, 1st Baron Forster. In 1925, under prime minister Stanley Bruce, the same practice was followed for the appointment of Forster&#x27;s successor John Baird, 1st Viscount Stonehaven, with the Australian government publicly stating that his name &quot;had been submitted, with others, to the Commonwealth ministry, who had selected him&quot;.

During the 1920s, the importance of the position declined. As a result of decisions made at the 1926 Imperial Conference, the governor-general ceased to represent the British government diplomatically, and the British right of supervision over Australian affairs was abolished. As a result of the Balfour Declaration of 1926, which declared that the UK and the Dominions to be &quot;autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another&quot;, the declaration further stated:

However, it remained unclear just whose prerogative it now became to decide who new governors-general would be. In 1930, King George V and the Australian prime minister James Scullin discussed the appointment of a new governor-general to replace Lord Stonehaven, whose term was coming to an end. The King maintained that it was now his sole prerogative to choose a governor-general, and he wanted Field-Marshal Sir William Birdwood for the Australian post. Scullin recommended the Australian jurist Sir Isaac Isaacs, and he insisted that George V act on the advice of his Australian prime minister in this matter. Scullin was partially influenced by the precedent set by the government of the Irish Free State, which always insisted upon having an Irishman as the governor-general of the Irish Free State.

Scullin&#x27;s proposed appointment of Sir Isaac Isaacs was fiercely opposed by the British government. This was not because of any lack of regard for Isaacs personally, but because the British government considered that the choice of governors-general was, since the 1926 Imperial Conference, a matter for the monarch&#x27;s decision alone. (However, it became very clear in a conversation between Scullin and King George V&#x27;s private secretary, Lord Stamfordham, on 11 November 1930, that this was merely the official reason for the objection, with the real reason being that an Australian, no matter how highly regarded personally, was not considered appropriate to be a governor-general.) Scullin was equally insistent that the monarch must act on the relevant prime minister&#x27;s direct advice (the practice until 1926 was that Dominion prime ministers advised the monarch indirectly, through the British government, which effectively had a veto over any proposal it did not agree with). Scullin cited the precedents of the prime minister of South Africa, J. B. M. Hertzog, who had recently insisted on his choice of George Villiers, 6th Earl of Clarendon as governor-general of that country, and the selection of an Irishman as governor-general of the Irish Free State. Both of these appointments had been agreed to despite British government objections.

Despite these precedents, George V remained reluctant to accept Scullin&#x27;s recommendation of Isaacs and asked him to consider Birdwood. However, Scullin stood firm, saying he would be prepared to fight a general election on the issue of whether an Australian should be prevented from becoming governor-general because he was Australian. On 29 November, the King agreed to Isaacs&#x27;s appointment, but made it clear that he did so only because he felt he had no option. Lord Stamfordham had complained that Scullin had &quot;put a gun to the King&#x27;s head&quot;.

The usual wording of official announcements of this nature read &quot;The King has been pleased to appoint ...&quot;, but on this occasion the announcement said merely &quot;The King has appointed ...&quot;, and Lord Stamfordham asked the Australian solicitor-general, Sir Robert Garran, to make sure that Scullin was aware of the exact wording. The opposition Nationalist Party of Australia denounced the appointment as &quot;practically republican&quot;, but Scullin had set a precedent. The convention gradually became established throughout the British Commonwealth that the governor-general is a citizen of the country concerned, and is appointed on the advice of the government of that country.

At the same time as the appointment of Isaacs as the first Australian-born governor-general, a separate role of British Representative in Australia (as the representative of the British government) was established, with Ernest Crutchley the first appointee. 1935 saw the appointment of the first British High Commissioner to Australia, Geoffrey Whiskard (in office 1936–1941).

This right not only to advise the monarch directly, but also to expect that advice to be accepted, was soon taken up by all the other Dominion prime ministers. This, among other things, led to the &quot;Statute of Westminster 1931&quot; and to the formal separation of the Crowns of the Dominions.

After Scullin&#x27;s defeat in 1931, non-Labor governments continued to recommend British people for appointment as governor-general, but such appointments remained solely a matter between the Australian government and the monarch. In 1947, Labor appointed a second Australian governor-general, William McKell, who was in office as the Labor premier of New South Wales. The then leader of the Opposition, Robert Menzies, called McKell&#x27;s appointment &quot;shocking and humiliating&quot;.

In 1965 the Menzies conservative government appointed an Australian, Lord Casey, and thereafter only Australians have held the position. However, when the Palace papers were released in 2020, it was revealed that the Fraser government in 1976 considered it &quot;highly desirable&quot; that Prince Charles become governor-general; however the Queen strongly indicated her disapproval of her son taking up the role until &quot;such time as he has a settled married life&quot;. Additionally, in 2007 media outlets reported that Prince William might become governor-general of Australia. However, both the prime minister, John Howard, and Clarence House repudiated the suggestion.

===Backgrounds of governors-general===
All the governors-general until 1965 were British-born, except for Australian-born Sir Isaac Isaacs (1931–1936) and Sir William McKell (1947–1953). They included six barons, two viscounts, two earls, and one prince. There have been only Australian occupants since then, although Sir Ninian Stephen (1982–1989) had been born in Britain. Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, was a senior member of the royal family. Dame Quentin Bryce (2008–2014) was the first woman to be appointed to the office. Sir Isaac Isaacs and Sir Zelman Cowen were Jewish; Bill Hayden was an avowed atheist during his term and he made an affirmation rather than swear an oath at the beginning of his commission; the remaining governors-general have been Christian.

Various governors-general had previously served as governors of an Australian state or colony: John Hope, 7th Earl of Hopetoun (Victoria 1889–1895); Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson (South Australia 1899–1902); Alexander Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie (South Australia 1928–34; and New South Wales 1935–1936); Major General Michael Jeffery (Western Australia 1993–2000); Dame Quentin Bryce (Queensland 2003–2008); General David Hurley (New South Wales 2014–2019). Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson had been offered the governorship of South Australia in 1895 and of Victoria in 1910, but refused both appointments. Henry Northcote, 1st Baron Northcote was governor of Bombay. Lord Casey was governor of Bengal in between his periods of service to the Commonwealth Parliament.

Former leading politicians and members of the judiciary have figured prominently. William Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1902–1905). John Baird, 1st Viscount Stonehaven (as John Baird) was minister for Transport in the cabinets of Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin; and after his return to Britain he became chairman of the UK Conservative Party. Sir Isaac Isaacs was successively Commonwealth attorney-general, a High Court judge, and chief justice. Sir William McKell was premier of New South Wales. William Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil (as William Morrison) was Speaker of the UK House of Commons. William Sidney, 1st Viscount De L&#x27;Isle was secretary of State for Air in Winston Churchill&#x27;s cabinet from 1951 to 1955. More recent governors-general in this category include Lord Casey, Sir Paul Hasluck, Sir John Kerr, Sir Ninian Stephen, Bill Hayden and Sir William Deane.

Of the eleven Australians appointed governor-general since 1965, Lord Casey, Sir Paul Hasluck and Bill Hayden were former federal parliamentarians; Sir John Kerr was the chief justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales; Sir Ninian Stephen and Sir William Deane were appointed from the bench of the High Court; Sir Zelman Cowen was a vice-chancellor of the University of Queensland and constitutional lawyer; Peter Hollingworth was the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane; and Major General Michael Jeffery was a retired military officer and former governor of Western Australia. Quentin Bryce&#x27;s appointment was announced during her term as governor of Queensland; she had previously been the Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner. General David Hurley was a retired chief of Defence Force and former governor of New South Wales.

Significant post-retirement activities of earlier governors-general have included: Lord Tennyson was appointed deputy governor of the Isle of Wight; Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson (by now Lord Novar) became secretary of State for Scotland; and Lord Gowrie became chairman of the Marylebone Cricket Club (Henry Forster, 1st Baron Forster had also held this post, before his appointment as governor-general).

<doc id="12607" wikidata="Q173100" url="?curid=12607" title="Glasnost">
<text>Glasnost ( ; , ) is a concept relating to openness and transparency. It has several general and specific meanings, including a policy of maximum openness in the activities of state institutions and freedom of information and the inadmissibility of hushing up problems. In Russian, the word &quot;glasnost&quot; has long been used to mean &#x27;openness&#x27; and &#x27;transparency&#x27;. In the mid-1980s, it was popularised by Mikhail Gorbachev as a political slogan for increased government transparency in the Soviet Union within the framework of &quot;perestroika&quot;, and the word came to be used in English in the latter meaning.

==Historical usage==
In the Russian Empire of the late-19th century, the term was used in its direct meanings of &quot;openness&quot; and &quot;publicity&quot; and applied to politics and the judicial system. Some reforms were introduced towards reforms permitting attendance of the press and the public at trials. After some liberalization under Alexander II of Russia, the openness of trials started to be restricted again. Human rights activist Lyudmila Alexeyeva writes that the word &quot;glasnost&quot; has been in the Russian language for several hundred years as a common term: &quot;It was in the dictionaries and lawbooks as long as there had been dictionaries and lawbooks. It was an ordinary, hardworking, non-descript word that was used to refer to a process, any process of justice or governance, being conducted in the open.&quot; In the mid-1960s it acquired a revived topical importance in discourse about the necessity of changing the Cold War era internal policy of the Soviet Union.

==In the USSR==

===The dissidents===
On 5 December 1965 the Glasnost rally took place in Moscow, considered to be a key event in the emergence of the Soviet civil rights movement. Protesters on Pushkin Square led by Alexander Yesenin-Volpin demanded access to the closed trial of Yuly Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky. The protestors made specific requests for &quot;glasnost&quot;, herein referring to the specific admission of the public, independent observers and foreign journalists, to the trial that had been legislated in the then newly issued Code of Criminal Procedure. With a few specified exceptions, Article 111 of the Code stated that judicial hearings in the USSR should be held in public.

Such protests against closed trials continued throughout the post-Stalin era. Andrei Sakharov, for example, did not travel to Oslo to receive his Nobel Peace Prize due to his public protest outside a Vilnius court building demanding access to the 1976 trial of Sergei Kovalev, an editor of the &quot;Chronicle of Current Events&quot; and prominent rights activist.

===Gorbachev===
In 1986, Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev and his advisers adopted &quot;glasnost&quot; as a political slogan, together with the term &quot;perestroika&quot;. Alexander Yakovlev, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, is considered to be the intellectual force behind Gorbachev&#x27;s reform program.

Glasnost was taken to mean increased openness and transparency in government institutions and activities in the Soviet Union (USSR). &quot;Glasnost&quot; reflected a commitment of the Gorbachev administration to allowing Soviet citizens to discuss publicly the problems of their system and potential solutions. Gorbachev encouraged popular scrutiny and criticism of leaders, as well as a certain level of exposure by the mass media.

Some critics, especially among legal reformers and dissidents, regarded the Soviet authorities&#x27; new slogans as vague and limited alternatives to more basic liberties. Alexei Simonov, president of the Glasnost Defence Foundation, makes a critical definition of the term in suggesting it was &quot;a tortoise crawling towards Freedom of Speech&quot;.

====Various meanings====
Between 1986 and 1991, during an era of reforms in the USSR, glasnost was frequently linked with other generalised concepts such as perestroika (literally: restructuring or regrouping) and demokratizatsiya (democratisation). Gorbachev often appealed to glasnost when promoting policies aimed at reducing corruption at the top of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, and moderating the abuse of administrative power in the Central Committee. The ambiguity of &quot;glasnost&quot; defines the distinctive five-year period (1986–1991) at the end of the USSR&#x27;s existence. There was decreasing pre-publication and pre-broadcast censorship and greater freedom of information.

The &quot;Era of Glasnost&quot; saw greater contact between Soviet citizens and the Western world, particularly the United States: restrictions on travel were loosened for many Soviet citizens which further eased pressures on international exchange between the Soviet Union and the West.

====International relations====
Gorbachev&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;glasnost&quot; can best be summarised in English as &quot;openness&quot;. While associated with freedom of speech, the main goal of this policy was to make the country&#x27;s management transparent, and circumvent the holding of near-complete control of the economy and bureaucracy of the Soviet Union by a concentrated body of officials and bureaucratic personnel.

During Glasnost, Soviet history under Stalin was re-examined; censored literature in the libraries was made more widely available; and there was a greater freedom of speech for citizens and openness in the media. It was in the late 1980s when most people in the Soviet Union began to learn about the atrocities of Stalin, and learned about previously suppressed events.

Information about the supposedly higher quality of consumer goods and quality of life in the United States and Western Europe began to be transmitted to the Soviet population, along with western popular culture.

==Outside the Soviet Union==
Glasnost received mixed reception in communist states, especially outside the Eastern Bloc.

===Support===
Glasnost had a trickle-down effect on Eastern Europe and led to democratic reforms, namely in Poland and Czech Republic. Glasnost and similar reforms were applied in the following communist states:
* Bulgaria
* Czechoslovakia
* East Germany
* Hungary
* Mongolia
* Poland
* Vietnam (see đổi mới)

Furthermore, in the socialist state of Yugoslavia, similar reforms also existed, with the first major reforms beginning in Slovenia.

===Opposition===
Glasnost or similar reforms were not applied in the following communist states:
* China (had its own non-Soviet-inspired reforms)
* Cuba
* Laos
* North Korea
* Romania (opposed by Nicolae Ceaușescu)

==In Russia since 1991==
The outright prohibition of censorship was enshrined in Article 29 of the new 1993 Constitution of the Russian Federation. This however has been the subject of ongoing controversy in contemporary Russia owing to heightened governmental interventions restricting access to information for Russian citizens, including internet censorship. There has also been pressure on government-operated media outlets to not publicize or discuss certain events or subjects in recent years. Monitoring of the infringement of media rights in the years from 2004 to 2013 found that instances of censorship were the most commonly reported type of violation.

<text>Geodesy or geodetics is the science of measuring and representing the geometry, gravity, and spatial orientation of the Earth in temporally varying 3D. It is called planetary geodesy when studying other astronomical bodies, such as planets or circumplanetary systems. Geodesy is an earth science and many consider the study of Earth&#x27;s shape and gravity to be central to that science. It is also a discipline of applied mathematics.

Geodynamical phenomena, including crustal motion, tides, and polar motion, can be studied by designing global and national control networks, applying space geodesy and terrestrial geodetic techniques, and relying on datums and coordinate systems. Geodetic job titles include geodesist and geodetic surveyor.

== History ==

Geodesy began in pre-scientific antiquity, so the very word geodesy comes from the Ancient Greek word or &quot;geodaisia&quot; (literally, &quot;division of Earth&quot;).

Early ideas about the figure of the Earth held the Earth to be flat and the heavens a physical dome spanning over it. Two early arguments for a spherical Earth were that lunar eclipses appear to an observer as circular shadows and that Polaris appears lower and lower in the sky to a traveler headed South.

== Definition ==
In English, geodesy refers to the science of measuring and representing geospatial information, while geomatics encompasses practical applications of geodesy on local and regional scales, including surveying.

In German, geodesy can refer to either &quot;higher geodesy&quot; ( or , literally &quot;geomensuration&quot;) — concerned with measuring Earth on the global scale, or &quot;engineering geodesy&quot; () that includes surveying — measuring parts or regions of Earth.

For the longest time, geodesy was the science of measuring and understanding Earth&#x27;s geometric shape, orientation in space, and gravitational field; however, geodetic science and operations are applied to other astronomical bodies in our Solar System also.

To a large extent, Earth&#x27;s shape is the result of rotation, which causes its equatorial bulge, and the competition of geological processes such as the collision of plates, as well as of volcanism, resisted by Earth&#x27;s gravitational field. This applies to the solid surface, the liquid surface (dynamic sea surface topography), and Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. For this reason, the study of Earth&#x27;s gravitational field is called physical geodesy.

== Geoid and reference ellipsoid ==


The geoid essentially is the figure of Earth abstracted from its topographical features. It is an idealized equilibrium surface of seawater, the mean sea level surface in the absence of currents and air pressure variations, and continued under the continental masses. Unlike a reference ellipsoid, the geoid is irregular and too complicated to serve as the computational surface for solving geometrical problems like point positioning. The geometrical separation between the geoid and a reference ellipsoid is called &quot;geoidal &quot;, and it varies globally between ±110 m based on the GRS 80 ellipsoid.

A reference ellipsoid, customarily chosen to be the same size (volume) as the geoid, is described by its semi-major axis (equatorial radius) &quot;a&quot; and flattening &quot;f&quot;. The quantity &quot;f&quot; = , where &quot;b&quot; is the semi-minor axis (polar radius), is purely geometrical. The mechanical ellipticity of Earth (dynamical flattening, symbol &quot;J&quot;2) can be determined to high precision by observation of satellite orbit perturbations. Its relationship with geometrical flattening is indirect and depends on the internal density distribution or, in simplest terms, the degree of central concentration of mass.

The 1980 Geodetic Reference System (GRS 80), adopted at the XVII General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG), posited a 6,378,137 m semi-major axis and a 1:298.257 flattening. GRS 80 essentially constitutes the basis for geodetic positioning by the Global Positioning System (GPS) and is thus also in widespread use outside the geodetic community. Numerous systems used for mapping and charting are becoming obsolete as countries increasingly move to global, geocentric reference systems utilizing the GRS 80 reference ellipsoid.

The geoid is a &quot;realizable&quot; surface, meaning it can be consistently located on Earth by suitable simple measurements from physical objects like a tide gauge. The geoid can, therefore, be considered a physical (&quot;real&quot;) surface. The reference ellipsoid, however, has many possible instantiations and is not readily realizable, so it is an abstract surface. The third primary surface of geodetic interest — the topographic surface of Earth — is also realizable.

== Coordinate systems in space ==

The locations of points in 3D space most conveniently are described by three cartesian or rectangular coordinates, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot;. Since the advent of satellite positioning, such coordinate systems are typically geocentric, with the Z-axis aligned to Earth&#x27;s (conventional or instantaneous) rotation axis.

Before the era of satellite geodesy, the coordinate systems associated with a geodetic datum attempted to be geocentric, but with the origin differing from the geocenter by hundreds of meters due to regional deviations in the direction of the plumbline (vertical). These regional geodetic datums, such as ED 50 (European Datum 1950) or NAD 27 (North American Datum 1927), have ellipsoids associated with them that are regional &quot;best fits&quot; to the geoids within their areas of validity, minimizing the deflections of the vertical over these areas.

It is only because GPS satellites orbit about the geocenter that this point becomes naturally the origin of a coordinate system defined by satellite geodetic means, as the satellite positions in space themselves get computed within such a system.

Geocentric coordinate systems used in geodesy can be divided naturally into two classes:
# The inertial reference systems, where the coordinate axes retain their orientation relative to the fixed stars or, equivalently, to the rotation axes of ideal gyroscopes. The &quot;X&quot;-axis points to the vernal equinox.
# The co-rotating reference systems (also ECEF or &quot;Earth Centred, Earth Fixed&quot;), in which the axes are &quot;attached&quot; to the solid body of Earth. The &quot;X&quot;-axis lies within the Greenwich observatory&#x27;s meridian plane.

The coordinate transformation between these two systems to good approximation is described by (apparent) sidereal time, which accounts for variations in Earth&#x27;s axial rotation (length-of-day variations). A more accurate description also accounts for polar motion as a phenomenon closely monitored by geodesists.

=== Coordinate systems in the plane ===


In geodetic applications like surveying and mapping, two general types of coordinate systems in the plane are in use:

# Plano-polar, with points in the plane defined by their distance, &quot;s&quot;, from a specified point along a ray having a direction &quot;α&quot; from a baseline or axis.
# Rectangular, with points defined by distances from two mutually perpendicular axes, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. Contrary to the mathematical convention, in geodetic practice, the &quot;x&quot;-axis points North and the &quot;y&quot;-axis East.

One can intuitively use rectangular coordinates in the plane for one&#x27;s current location, in which case the &quot;x&quot;-axis will point to the local north. More formally, such coordinates can be obtained from 3D coordinates using the artifice of a map projection. It is impossible to map the curved surface of Earth onto a flat map surface without deformation. The compromise most often chosen — called a conformal projection — preserves angles and length ratios so that small circles get mapped as small circles and small squares as squares.

An example of such a projection is UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator). Within the map plane, we have rectangular coordinates &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. In this case, the north direction used for reference is the &quot;map&quot; north, not the &quot;local&quot; north. The difference between the two is called meridian convergence.

It is easy enough to &quot;translate&quot; between polar and rectangular coordinates in the plane: let, as above, direction and distance be &quot;α&quot; and &quot;s&quot; respectively; then we have:

:formula_1

The reverse transformation is given by:

:formula_2

== Heights ==

In geodesy, point or terrain &quot;heights&quot; are &quot;above sea level&quot; as an irregular, physically defined surface.
Height systems in use are:

# Orthometric heights
# Dynamic heights
# Geopotential heights
# Normal heights

Each system has its advantages and disadvantages. Both orthometric and normal heights are expressed in metres above sea level, whereas geopotential numbers are measures of potential energy (unit: m2 s−2) and not metric. The reference surface is the geoid, an equigeopotential surface approximating the mean sea level as described above. For normal heights, the reference surface is the so-called &quot;quasi-geoid&quot;, which has a few-metre separation from the geoid due to the density assumption in its continuation under the continental masses.

One can relate these heights through the geoid undulation concept to &quot;ellipsoidal heights&quot; (also known as &quot;geodetic heights&quot;), representing the height of a point above the reference ellipsoid. Satellite positioning receivers typically provide ellipsoidal heights unless fitted with special conversion software based on a model of the geoid.

== Geodetic datums ==

Because coordinates and heights of geodetic points always get obtained within a system that itself was constructed based on real-world observations, geodesists introduced the concept of a &quot;geodetic datum&quot; (plural &quot;datums&quot;): a physical (real-world) realization of a coordinate system used for describing point locations. This realization follows from &quot;choosing&quot; (therefore conventional) coordinate values for one or more datum points. In the case of height data, it suffices to choose &quot;one&quot; datum point — the reference benchmark, typically a tide gauge at the shore. Thus we have vertical datums, such as the NAVD 88 (North American Vertical Datum 1988), NAP (Normaal Amsterdams Peil), the Kronstadt datum, the Trieste datum, and numerous others.

In both mathematics and geodesy, a coordinate system is a &quot;coordinate system&quot; per ISO terminology, whereas the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) uses the term &quot;reference system&quot; for the same. When coordinates are realized by choosing datum points and fixing a geodetic datum, ISO speaks of a &quot;coordinate reference system&quot;, whereas IERS uses a &quot;reference frame&quot; for the same. The ISO term for a datum transformation again is a &quot;coordinate transformation&quot;.

== Positioning ==


General geopositioning, or simply positioning, is the determination of the location of points on Earth, by myriad techniques. Geodetic positioning employs geodetic methods to determine a set of precise geodetic coordinates of a point on land, at sea, or in space. It may be done within a coordinate system (point positioning or absolute positioning) or relative to another point (relative positioning). One computes the position of a point in space from measurements linking terrestrial or extraterrestrial points of known location (&quot;known points&quot;) with terrestrial ones of unknown location (&quot;unknown points&quot;). The computation may involve transformations between or among astronomical and terrestrial coordinate systems. Known points used in point positioning can be GNSS continuously operating reference stations or triangulation points of a higher-order network.

Traditionally, geodesists built a hierarchy of networks to allow point positioning within a country. The highest in this hierarchy were triangulation networks, densified into the networks of traverses (polygons) into which local mapping and surveying measurements, usually collected using a measuring tape, a corner prism, and the red-and-white poles, are tied.

Commonly used nowadays is GPS, except for specialized measurements (e.g., in underground or high-precision engineering). The higher-order networks are measured with static GPS, using differential measurement to determine vectors between terrestrial points. These vectors then get adjusted in a traditional network fashion. A global polyhedron of permanently operating GPS stations under the auspices of the IERS is the basis for defining a single global, geocentric reference frame that serves as the &quot;zero-order&quot; (global) reference to which national measurements are attached.

Real-time kinematic positioning (RTK GPS) is employed frequently in survey mapping. In that measurement technique, unknown points can get quickly tied into nearby terrestrial known points.

One purpose of point positioning is the provision of known points for mapping measurements, also known as (horizontal and vertical) control. There can be thousands of those geodetically determined points in a country, usually documented by national mapping agencies. Surveyors involved in real estate and insurance will use these to tie their local measurements.

== Geodetic problems ==


In geometrical geodesy, there are two main problems:

* First geodetic problem (also known as &quot;direct&quot; or &quot;forward geodetic problem&quot;): given the coordinates of a point and the directional (azimuth) and distance to a second point, determine the coordinates of that second point.
* Second geodetic problem (also known as &quot;inverse&quot; or &quot;reverse geodetic problem&quot;): given the coordinates of two points, determine the azimuth and length of the (straight, curved, or geodesic) line connecting those points.

The solutions to both problems in plane geometry reduce to simple trigonometry and are valid for small areas on Earth&#x27;s surface; on a sphere, solutions become significantly more complex as, for example, in the inverse problem, the azimuths differ going between the two end points along the arc of the connecting great circle.

The general solution is called the geodesic for the surface considered, and the differential equations for the geodesic are solvable numerically. On the ellipsoid of revolution, geodesics are expressible in terms of elliptic integrals, which are usually evaluated in terms of a series expansion — see, for example, Vincenty&#x27;s formulae.

== Observational concepts ==

As defined in geodesy (and also astronomy), some basic observational concepts like angles and coordinates include (most commonly from the viewpoint of a local observer):

* Plumbline or vertical: (the line along) the direction of local gravity.
* Zenith: the (direction to the) intersection of the upwards-extending gravity vector at a point and the celestial sphere.
* Nadir: the (direction to the) antipodal point where the downward-extending gravity vector intersects the (obscured) celestial sphere.
* Celestial horizon: a plane perpendicular to the gravity vector at a point.
* Azimuth: the direction angle within the plane of the horizon, typically counted clockwise from the north (in geodesy and astronomy) or the south (in France).
* Elevation: the angular height of an object above the horizon; alternatively: zenith distance equal to 90 degrees minus elevation.
* Local topocentric coordinates: azimuth (direction angle within the plane of the horizon), elevation angle (or zenith angle), distance.
* North celestial pole: the extension of Earth&#x27;s (precessing and nutating) instantaneous spin axis extended northward to intersect the celestial sphere. (Similarly for the south celestial pole.)
* Celestial equator: the (instantaneous) intersection of Earth&#x27;s equatorial plane with the celestial sphere.
* Meridian plane: any plane perpendicular to the celestial equator and containing the celestial poles.
* Local meridian: the plane which contains the direction to the zenith and the celestial pole.

== Measurements ==

The reference surface (level) used to determine height differences and height reference systems is known as mean sea level. The traditional spirit level directly produces such (for practical purposes most useful) heights above sea level; the more economical use of GPS instruments for height determination requires precise knowledge of the figure of the geoid, as GPS only gives heights above the GRS80 reference ellipsoid. As geoid determination improves, one may expect that the use of GPS in height determination shall increase, too.

The theodolite is an instrument used to measure horizontal and vertical (relative to the local vertical) angles to target points. In addition, the tachymeter determines, electronically or electro-optically, the distance to a target and is highly automated or even robotic in operations. Widely used for the same purpose is the method of free station position.

Commonly for local detail surveys, tachymeters are employed, although the old-fashioned rectangular technique using an angle prism and steel tape is still an inexpensive alternative. As mentioned, also there are quick and relatively accurate real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS techniques. Data collected are tagged and recorded digitally for entry into Geographic Information System (GIS) databases.

Geodetic GNSS (most commonly GPS) receivers directly produce 3D coordinates in a geocentric coordinate frame. One such frame is WGS84, as well as frames by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS). GNSS receivers have almost completely replaced terrestrial instruments for large-scale base network surveys.

To monitor the Earth&#x27;s rotation irregularities and plate tectonic motions and for planet-wide geodetic surveys, methods of very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) measuring distances to quasars, lunar laser ranging (LLR) measuring distances to prisms on the Moon, and satellite laser ranging (SLR) measuring distances to prisms on artificial satellites, are employed.

Gravity is measured using gravimeters, of which there are two kinds. First are &quot;absolute gravimeter&quot;s, based on measuring the acceleration of free fall (e.g., of a reflecting prism in a vacuum tube). They are used to establish vertical geospatial control or in the field. Second, &quot;relative gravimeter&quot;s are spring-based and more common. They are used in gravity surveys over large areas — to establish the figure of the geoid over these areas. The most accurate relative gravimeters are called &quot;superconducting gravimeter&quot;s, which are sensitive to one-thousandth of one-billionth of Earth-surface gravity. Twenty-some superconducting gravimeters are used worldwide in studying Earth&#x27;s tides, rotation, interior, oceanic and atmospheric loading, as well as in verifying the Newtonian constant of gravitation.

In the future, gravity and altitude might become measurable using the special-relativistic concept of time dilation as gauged by optical clocks.

== Units and measures on the ellipsoid ==


Geographical latitude and longitude are stated in the units degree, minute of arc, and second of arc. They are &quot;angles&quot;, not metric
measures, and describe the &quot;direction&quot; of the local normal to the reference ellipsoid of revolution. This direction is &quot;approximately&quot; the same as the direction of the plumbline, i.e., local gravity, which is also the normal to the geoid surface. For this reason, astronomical position determination – measuring the direction of the plumbline by astronomical means – works reasonably well when one also uses an ellipsoidal model of the figure of the Earth.

One geographical mile, defined as one minute of arc on the equator, equals 1,855.32571922 m. One nautical mile is one minute of astronomical latitude. The radius of curvature of the ellipsoid varies with latitude, being the longest at the pole and the shortest at the equator same as with the nautical mile.

A metre was originally defined as the 10-millionth part of the length from the equator to the North Pole along the meridian through Paris (the target was not quite reached in actual implementation, as it is off by 200 ppm in the current definitions). This situation means that one kilometre roughly equals (1/40,000) * 360 * 60 meridional minutes of arc, or 0.54 nautical miles. (This is not exactly so as the two units had been defined on different bases, so the international nautical mile is 1,852 m exactly, which corresponds to rounding the quotient from 1,000/0.54 m to four digits).

== Temporal changes ==


Various techniques are used in geodesy to study temporally changing surfaces, bodies of mass, physical fields, and dynamical systems. Points on Earth&#x27;s surface change their location due to a variety of mechanisms:

* Continental plate motion, plate tectonics
* The episodic motion of tectonic origin, especially close to fault lines
* Periodic effects due to tides and tidal loading
* Postglacial land uplift due to isostatic adjustment
* Mass variations due to hydrological changes, including the atmosphere, cryosphere, land hydrology, and oceans
* Sub-daily polar motion
* Length-of-day variability
* Earth&#x27;s center-of-mass (geocenter) variations
* Anthropogenic movements such as reservoir construction or petroleum or water extraction

Geodynamics is the discipline that studies deformations and motions of Earth&#x27;s crust and its solidity as a whole. Often the study of Earth&#x27;s irregular rotation is included in the above definition. Geodynamical studies require terrestrial reference frames realized by the stations belonging to the Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS).

Techniques for studying geodynamic phenomena on global scales include:

* Satellite positioning by GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou
* Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI)
* Satellite laser ranging (SLR) and lunar laser ranging (LLR)
* DORIS
* Regionally and locally precise leveling
* Precise tachymeters
* Monitoring of gravity change using land, airborne, shipborne, and spaceborne gravimetry
* Satellite altimetry based on microwave and laser observations for studying the ocean surface, sea level rise, and ice cover monitoring
* Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) using satellite images.

<text>A Eurogame, also called a German-style board game, German game, or Euro-style game (generally just referred to as board games in Europe), is a class of tabletop games that generally features indirect player interaction, lacks player elimination, and provides multiple ways to score points. Eurogames are sometimes contrasted with American-style board games, which generally involve more luck, conflict, and drama. They are usually less abstract than chess or Go, but more abstract than wargames. Likewise, they generally require more thought and planning than party games such as &quot;Pictionary&quot; or &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;.

== History ==

Due in part to postwar aversion to products which glorified conflict, the 3M series of strategy and economic games, including &quot;Acquire&quot;, became popular in Germany. They offered a style of gameplay without direct conflict or warfare and led the way for designs that focused on resource management and competitive strategy through more peaceful means. 

=== German family board games ===
The genre developed as a more concentrated design movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Germany. The genre has spread to other European countries such as France, the Netherlands, and Sweden. During this time, board games in Europe often featured shorter play times than their American counterparts, along with rules that encouraged all players to remain engaged until the end, thereby reducing the risk of early elimination.

=== Settlers of Catan: A Worldwide Phenomenon ===
Although German-style designs were already popular within Germany, &quot;The Settlers of Catan&quot;, first published in 1995, paved the way for the genre outside Europe. While it was not the first Eurogame and not the first to achieve popularity outside Germany, it became more successful than any of its predecessors. Millions of copies were sold in Germany alone. The game&#x27;s success brought new interest, investment, and attention to this genre of board games emphasizing planning and negotiation rather than direct conflict. Game designers like Reiner Knizia became popular globally. Knizia&#x27;s notable designs include &quot;Amun-Re&quot;, &quot;Blue Moon City&quot;, &quot;Ingenious&quot;, &quot;Keltis&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Medici&quot;, &quot;Modern Art&quot;, &quot;Ra&quot;, &quot;Taj Mahal&quot;, &quot;Tigris and Euphrates&quot;, and &quot;Through the Desert&quot;. Many of his designs incorporate mathematical principles, such as his repeated use of auction mechanics.

=== Growth in the 21st Century ===
As the market expanded, some designers began creating deeper, more complex games often referred to as “gamer’s games” or “expert games.” Titles such as &quot;Agricola&quot; (2007) by Uwe Rosenberg and &quot;Terra Mystica&quot; (2012) by Helge Ostertag and Jens Drögemüller introduced more detailed resource management, longer playing times, and heightened decision depth. These games often came with multiple paths to victory, ensuring replay value and a variety of strategies for enthusiasts. Residents of Germany purchased more board games per capita than any other country . While many Eurogames are published and played in Anglophone markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom, they occupy a niche status there. Other games in the genre to achieve widespread popularity include &quot;Carcassonne&quot;, &quot;Puerto Rico&quot;, &quot;TransAmerica&quot;, &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;, &quot;Alhambra&quot;, &quot;Brass,&quot; and &quot;Terraforming Mars&quot;. Today, Eurogames remain an important segment of the board gaming industry, appreciated for their emphasis on strategy, thoughtful interaction, and lack of player elimination that allows all participants to remain engaged. While Germany still leads in per capita board game purchases, the popularity of Eurogames has spread worldwide, and many titles now receive international distribution and acclaim. Conventions such as &quot;Essen Spiel&quot; in Germany gather thousands of fans annually.

== Characteristics ==

Eurogames tend to be focused on presenting a complex challenge to players. They feature economics and the acquisition of resources rather than direct conflict, and have a limited amount of luck. They also differ from abstract strategy games like chess by using themes tied to specific locales, and emphasize individual development and comparative achievement rather than direct conflict. Eurogames also emphasize the mechanical challenges of their systems over having the systems match the theme of the game. They are generally simpler than the wargames that flourished in the 1970s and 1980s from publishers such as SPI and Avalon Hill, but still often have a considerable depth of play.

One consequence of the increasing popularity of this genre has been an expansion upwards in complexity. Games such as &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; that were considered quite complex when Eurogames proliferated in the U.S. after the turn of the millennium are now the norm, with newer high-end titles like &quot;Terra Mystica&quot; and &quot;Tzolkin&quot; being significantly more difficult to master.

=== Incentive for social play ===

While many titles (especially the strategically heavier ones) are enthusiastically played by gamers as a hobby, most Eurogames are well-suited to social play. In keeping with this social function, various characteristics of the games tend to support that aspect well, and these have become quite common across the genre. In contrast to games such as &quot;Risk&quot; or &quot;Monopoly&quot;, in which a close game can extend indefinitely, Eurogames usually have a mechanism to stop the game within its stated playing time. Common mechanisms include a predetermined winning score, a set number of game turns, or depletion of limited game resources. Playing time varies from a half-hour to a few hours, with one to two hours being typical. Generally, Eurogames do not have a fixed number of players like chess or bridge. Although there is a sizeable body of Eurogames that are designed for exactly two players, most games can accommodate between two to six players (with varying degrees of suitability). Six-player games are somewhat rare; examples include &quot;Power Grid&quot; and &quot;Caverna&quot; (the latter supporting seven-player games). Some require expansions, such as &quot;The Settlers of Catan&quot; or &quot;Carcassonne&quot;. Players usually play for themselves, rather than in a partnership or team.

A growing number of Eurogames support solo play with modified rulesets. To win, the player either has to achieve specific single-player campaign goals or beat the score of a simulated opponent that takes actions according to special rules outlined in the scenario. Recent Eurogames suitable for solo play include &quot;Wingspan&quot;, &quot;Terraforming Mars&quot;, and &quot;Spirit Island&quot;.
=== No player elimination ===
Another prominent characteristic of these games is the lack of player elimination. Eliminating players before the end of the game is seen as contrary to the social aspect of such games. Most of these games are designed to keep all players in the game as long as possible, so it is rare to be certain of victory or defeat until relatively late in the game. Related to no-player-elimination, Eurogame scoring systems are often designed so that hidden scoring or end-of-game bonuses can catapult a player who appears to be in a lagging position at end of play into the lead. A second-order consequence is that Eurogames tend to have multiple paths to victory (dependent on aiming at different end-of-game bonuses) and it is often not obvious to other players which strategic path a player is pursuing. Balancing mechanisms are often integrated into the rules, giving slight advantages to lagging players and slight hindrances to the leaders. This helps to keep the game competitive to the very end, an example of which is Power Grid, where the turn order is determined by number of cities (and biggest power plant as the tie-breaker), such that players further ahead are handicapped in their option of plays.

=== Game mechanics ===

A wide variety of often innovative mechanisms or mechanics are used, and familiar mechanics such as rolling dice and moving, capture, or trick-taking are avoided. If a game has a board, the board is usually irregular rather than uniform or symmetric (such as &quot;Risk&quot; rather than chess or &quot;Scrabble&quot;). The board is often random (as in &quot;The Settlers of Catan&quot;) or has random elements (such as &quot;Tikal&quot;). Some boards are merely mnemonic or organizational and contribute only to ease of play, such as a cribbage board; examples of this include &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; and &quot;Princes of Florence&quot;. Random elements are often present but do not usually dominate the game. While rules are light to moderate, they allow depth of play, usually requiring thought, planning, and a shift of tactics through the game and featuring a chess- or backgammon-like opening game, middle game, and end game.

Stewart Woods&#x27; &quot;Eurogames&quot; cites six examples of mechanics common to eurogames:

*Tile placement – spatial placement of game components on the playing board.
*Auctions – includes open and hidden auctions of both resources and actions from other players and the game system itself.
*Trading/negotiation – not simply trading resources of equivalent values, but allowing players to set markets.
*Set collection – collecting resources in specific groups that are then cashed in for points or other currency.
*Area control – also known as area majority or influence, this involves controlling a game element or board space through allocation of resources.
*Worker placement or role selection – players choose specific game actions in sequential order, with players disallowed from choosing a previously selected action.

=== Low randomness ===
Eurogame designs tend to de-emphasize luck and random elements. Often, the only random element of the game will be resource or terrain distribution in the initial setup, or (less frequently) the random order of a set of event or objective cards. The role played by deliberately random mechanics in other styles of game is instead fulfilled by the unpredictability of the behavior of other players.

=== Themes ===

Examples of themes are:
* &quot;Carcassonne&quot; – build a medieval landscape complete with walled cities, monasteries, roads, and fields.
* &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; – develop plantations on the island of Puerto Rico, set in the 18th century.
* &quot;Power Grid&quot; – expand a power company&#x27;s network and buy better plants.
* &quot;Imperial&quot; – as an international investor, influence the politics of pre-World War I European empires.
* &quot;Bruxelles 1893&quot; – take the role of an Art Nouveau architect during the late 19th century and try to become the most famous architect in Belgium.

=== Game designer as author ===
Although not relevant to actual play, the name of the game&#x27;s designer is often prominently mentioned on the box, or at least in the rule book. Top designers enjoy considerable following among enthusiasts of Eurogames. For this reason, the name &quot;designer games&quot; is often offered as a description of the genre. Recently, there has also been a wave of games designed as spin-offs of popular novels, such as the games taking their style from the German bestsellers &quot;Der Schwarm&quot; and &quot;Tintenherz&quot;.

=== Events ===

The Internationale Spieltage, also known as Essen Spiel, or the Essen Games Fair, is the largest non-digital game convention in the world, and the place where the largest number of Eurogames are released each year. Founded in 1983 and held annually in Essen, Germany, the fair was founded with the objective of providing a venue for people to meet and play board games, and show gaming as an integral part of German culture.

A &quot;World Boardgaming Championships&quot; is held annually in July in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The event is nine days long and includes tournament tracks of over a hundred games; while traditional wargames are played there, the most popular tournaments are Eurogames and it is generally perceived as a Eurogame-centered event. Attendance is international, though players from the U.S. and Canada predominate.

=== Awards ===
The most prestigious German board game award is the Spiel des Jahres (&quot;Game of the Year&quot;). The award is very family-oriented, with shorter, more approachable games such as &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; and &quot;Elfenland&quot; usually preferred by the award committee.

In 2011, the jury responsible for the Spiel des Jahres created the Kennerspiel des Jahres, or connoisseur&#x27;s game of the year, for more complex games.

The Deutscher Spiele Preis (&quot;German game prize&quot;) is also awarded to games that are more complex and strategic, such as &quot;Puerto Rico&quot;. A few games have had broad enough appeal to win both awards: &quot;The Settlers of Catan&quot; (published 1995), &quot;Carcassonne&quot; (published 2000), and &quot;Dominion&quot; (published 2008).

== Influence ==
Xbox Live Arcade has included popular games from the genre, with &quot;Catan&quot; being released to strong sales on May 13, 2007, &quot;Carcassonne&quot; being released on June 27, 2007. &quot;Lost Cities&quot; and &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; soon followed. &quot;Alhambra&quot; was due to follow later in 2007 until being cancelled.

The iPhone received versions of The Settlers of Catan and &quot;Zooloretto&quot; in 2009. Carcassonne was added to the iPhone App Store in June 2010. Later, Ticket to Ride was developed for both the iPhone and the iPad, significantly boosting sales of the board game.

<doc id="12610" wikidata="Q382037" url="?curid=12610" title="Grand Unified Theory">
<text>A Grand Unified Theory (GUT) is any model in particle physics that merges the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces (the three gauge interactions of the Standard Model) into a single force at high energies. Although this unified force has not been directly observed, many GUT models theorize its existence. If the unification of these three interactions is possible, it raises the possibility that there was a grand unification epoch in the very early universe in which these three fundamental interactions were not yet distinct.

Experiments have confirmed that at high energy, the electromagnetic interaction and weak interaction unify into a single combined electroweak interaction. GUT models predict that at even higher energy, the strong and electroweak interactions will unify into one electronuclear interaction. This interaction is characterized by one larger gauge symmetry and thus several force carriers, but one unified coupling constant. Unifying gravity with the electronuclear interaction would provide a more comprehensive theory of everything (TOE) rather than a Grand Unified Theory. Thus, GUTs are often seen as an intermediate step towards a TOE.

The novel particles predicted by GUT models are expected to have extremely high masses—around the GUT scale of formula_1 GeV (just three orders of magnitude below the Planck scale of formula_2 GeV)—and so are well beyond the reach of any foreseen particle hadron collider experiments. Therefore, the particles predicted by GUT models will be unable to be observed directly, and instead the effects of grand unification might be detected through indirect observations of the following:

* proton decay, 
* electric dipole moments of elementary particles, 
* or the properties of neutrinos.

Some GUTs, such as the Pati–Salam model, predict the existence of magnetic monopoles.

While GUTs might be expected to offer simplicity over the complications present in the Standard Model, realistic models remain complicated because they need to introduce additional fields and interactions, or even additional dimensions of space, in order to reproduce observed fermion masses and mixing angles. This difficulty, in turn, may be related to the existence of family symmetries beyond the conventional GUT models. Due to this and the lack of any observed effect of grand unification so far, there is no generally accepted GUT model.

Models that do not unify the three interactions using one simple group as the gauge symmetry but do so using semisimple groups can exhibit similar properties and are sometimes referred to as Grand Unified Theories as well.

==History==
Historically, the first true GUT, which was based on the simple Lie group , was proposed by Howard Georgi and Sheldon Glashow in 1974. The Georgi–Glashow model was preceded by the semisimple Lie algebra Pati–Salam model by Abdus Salam and Jogesh Pati also in 1974, who pioneered the idea to unify gauge interactions.

The acronym GUT was first coined in 1978 by CERN researchers John Ellis, Andrzej Buras, Mary K. Gaillard, and Dimitri Nanopoulos, however in the final version of their paper they opted for the less anatomical GUM (Grand Unification Mass). Nanopoulos later that year was the first to use the acronym in a paper.

==Motivation==
The fact that the electric charges of electrons and protons seem to cancel each other exactly to extreme precision is essential for the existence of the macroscopic world as we know it, but this important property of elementary particles is not explained in the Standard Model of particle physics. While the description of strong and weak interactions within the Standard Model is based on gauge symmetries governed by the simple symmetry groups and which allow only discrete charges, the remaining component, the weak hypercharge interaction is described by an abelian symmetry which in principle allows for arbitrary charge assignments. The observed charge quantization, namely the postulation that all known elementary particles carry electric charges which are exact multiples of one-third of the &quot;elementary&quot; charge, has led to the idea that hypercharge interactions and possibly the strong and weak interactions might be embedded in one Grand Unified interaction described by a single, larger simple symmetry group containing the Standard Model. This would automatically predict the quantized nature and values of all elementary particle charges. Since this also results in a prediction for the relative strengths of the fundamental interactions which we observe, in particular, the weak mixing angle, grand unification ideally reduces the number of independent input parameters but is also constrained by observations.

Grand unification is reminiscent of the unification of electric and magnetic forces by Maxwell&#x27;s field theory of electromagnetism in the 19th century, but its physical implications and mathematical structure are qualitatively different.

==Unification of matter particles==

===SU(5)===


 is the simplest GUT. The smallest simple Lie group which contains the standard model, and upon which the first Grand Unified Theory was based, is

:formula_3.

Such group symmetries allow the reinterpretation of several known particles, including the photon, W and Z bosons, and gluon, as different states of a single particle field. However, it is not obvious that the simplest possible choices for the extended &quot;Grand Unified&quot; symmetry should yield the correct inventory of elementary particles. The fact that all currently known matter particles fit perfectly into three copies of the smallest group representations of and immediately carry the correct observed charges, is one of the first and most important reasons why people believe that a Grand Unified Theory might actually be realized in nature.

The two smallest irreducible representations of are (the defining representation) and . (These bold numbers indicate the dimension of the representation.) In the standard assignment, the contains the charge conjugates of the right-handed down-type quark color triplet and a left-handed lepton isospin doublet, while the contains the six up-type quark components, the left-handed down-type quark color triplet, and the right-handed electron. This scheme has to be replicated for each of the three known generations of matter. It is notable that the theory is anomaly free with this matter content.

The hypothetical right-handed neutrinos are a singlet of , which means its mass is not forbidden by any symmetry; it doesn&#x27;t need a spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking which explains why its mass would be heavy (see seesaw mechanism).

===SO(10)===


The next simple Lie group which contains the standard model is

:formula_4.

Here, the unification of matter is even more complete, since the irreducible spinor representation contains both the and of and a right-handed neutrino, and thus the complete particle content of one generation of the extended standard model with neutrino masses. This is already the largest simple group that achieves the unification of matter in a scheme involving only the already known matter particles (apart from the Higgs sector).

Since different standard model fermions are grouped together in larger representations, GUTs specifically predict relations among the fermion masses, such as between the electron and the down quark, the muon and the strange quark, and the tau lepton and the bottom quark for and . Some of these mass relations hold approximately, but most don&#x27;t (see Georgi-Jarlskog mass relation).

The boson matrix for is found by taking the matrix from the representation of and adding an extra row and column for the right-handed neutrino. The bosons are found by adding a partner to each of the 20 charged bosons (2 right-handed W bosons, 6 massive charged gluons and 12 X/Y type bosons) and adding an extra heavy neutral Z-boson to make 5 neutral bosons in total. The boson matrix will have a boson or its new partner in each row and column. These pairs combine to create the familiar 16D Dirac spinor matrices of .

===E6===

In some forms of string theory, including E8 × E8 heterotic string theory, the resultant four-dimensional theory after spontaneous compactification on a six-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold resembles a GUT based on the group E6. Notably E6 is the only exceptional simple Lie group to have any complex representations, a requirement for a theory to contain chiral fermions (namely all weakly-interacting fermions). Hence the other four (G2, F4, E7, and E8) can&#x27;t be the gauge group of a GUT.

===Extended Grand Unified Theories===
Non-chiral extensions of the Standard Model with vectorlike split-multiplet particle spectra which naturally appear in the higher SU(N) GUTs considerably modify the desert physics and lead to the realistic (string-scale) grand unification for conventional three quark-lepton families even without using supersymmetry (see below). On the other hand, due to a new missing VEV mechanism emerging in the supersymmetric SU(8) GUT the simultaneous solution to the gauge hierarchy (doublet-triplet splitting) problem and problem of unification of flavor can be argued.

GUTs with four families / generations, SU(8): Assuming 4 generations of fermions instead of 3 makes a total of types of particles. These can be put into representations of . This can be divided into which is the theory together with some heavy bosons which act on the generation number.

GUTs with four families / generations, O(16): Again assuming 4 generations of fermions, the 128 particles and anti-particles can be put into a single spinor representation of .

===Symplectic groups and quaternion representations===
Symplectic gauge groups could also be considered. For example, (which is called in the article symplectic group) has a representation in terms of quaternion unitary matrices which has a dimensional real representation and so might be considered as a candidate for a gauge group. has 32 charged bosons and 4 neutral bosons. Its subgroups include so can at least contain the gluons and photon of . Although it&#x27;s probably not possible to have weak bosons acting on chiral fermions in this representation. A quaternion representation of the fermions might be:

:formula_5

A further complication with quaternion representations of fermions is that there are two types of multiplication: left multiplication and right multiplication which must be taken into account. It turns out that including left and right-handed quaternion matrices is equivalent to including a single right-multiplication by a unit quaternion which adds an extra SU(2) and so has an extra neutral boson and two more charged bosons. Thus the group of left- and right-handed quaternion matrices is which does include the standard model bosons:

:formula_6

If formula_7 is a quaternion valued spinor, formula_8 is quaternion hermitian matrix coming from and formula_9 is a pure vector quaternion (both of which are 4-vector bosons) then the interaction term is:

::formula_10

===Octonion representations===
It can be noted that a generation of 16 fermions can be put into the form of an octonion with each element of the octonion being an 8-vector. If the 3 generations are then put in a 3x3 hermitian matrix with certain additions for the diagonal elements then these matrices form an exceptional (Grassmann) Jordan algebra, which has the symmetry group of one of the exceptional Lie groups (, , , or ) depending on the details.

:formula_11

:formula_12

Because they are fermions the anti-commutators of the Jordan algebra become commutators. It is known that has subgroup and so is big enough to include the Standard Model. An gauge group, for example, would have 8 neutral bosons, 120 charged bosons and 120 charged anti-bosons. To account for the 248 fermions in the lowest multiplet of , these would either have to include anti-particles (and so have baryogenesis), have new undiscovered particles, or have gravity-like (spin connection) bosons affecting elements of the particles spin direction. Each of these possesses theoretical problems.

===Beyond Lie groups===
Other structures have been suggested including Lie 3-algebras and Lie superalgebras. Neither of these fit with Yang–Mills theory. In particular Lie superalgebras would introduce bosons with incorrect statistics. Supersymmetry, however, does fit with Yang–Mills.

==Unification of forces and the role of supersymmetry==
The unification of forces is possible due to the energy scale dependence of force coupling parameters in quantum field theory called renormalization group &quot;running&quot;, which allows parameters with vastly different values at usual energies to converge to a single value at a much higher energy scale.

The renormalization group running of the three gauge couplings in the Standard Model has been found to nearly, but not quite, meet at the same point if the hypercharge is normalized so that it is consistent with or GUTs, which are precisely the GUT groups which lead to a simple fermion unification. This is a significant result, as other Lie groups lead to different normalizations. However, if the supersymmetric extension MSSM is used instead of the Standard Model, the match becomes much more accurate. In this case, the coupling constants of the strong and electroweak interactions meet at the grand unification energy, also known as the GUT scale:

:formula_13.

It is commonly believed that this matching is unlikely to be a coincidence, and is often quoted as one of the main motivations to further investigate supersymmetric theories despite the fact that no supersymmetric partner particles have been experimentally observed. Also, most model builders simply assume supersymmetry because it solves the hierarchy problem—i.e., it stabilizes the electroweak Higgs mass against radiative corrections.

==Neutrino masses==
Since Majorana masses of the right-handed neutrino are forbidden by symmetry, GUTs predict the Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos to be close to the GUT scale where the symmetry is spontaneously broken in those models. In supersymmetric GUTs, this scale tends to be larger than would be desirable to obtain realistic masses of the light, mostly left-handed neutrinos (see neutrino oscillation) via the seesaw mechanism. These predictions are independent of the Georgi–Jarlskog mass relations, wherein some GUTs predict other fermion mass ratios.

==Proposed theories==
Several theories have been proposed, but none is currently universally accepted. An even more ambitious theory that includes &quot;all&quot; fundamental forces, including gravitation, is termed a theory of everything. Some common mainstream GUT models are:

* Pati–Salam model — 
* Georgi–Glashow model — ; and Flipped — 
* model; and Flipped — 
* model; and Trinification — 
* minimal left-right model — 
* 331 model — 
* chiral color

Not quite GUTs:

* Technicolor models
* Little Higgs
* String theory
* Causal fermion systems
* M-theory
* Preons
* Loop quantum gravity
* Causal dynamical triangulation theory

&quot;Note&quot;: These models refer to Lie algebras not to Lie groups. The Lie group could be formula_14 just to take a random example.

The most promising candidate is .
(Minimal) does not contain any exotic fermions (i.e. additional fermions besides the Standard Model fermions and the right-handed neutrino), and it unifies each generation into a single irreducible representation. A number of other GUT models are based upon subgroups of . They are the minimal left-right model, , flipped and the Pati–Salam model. The GUT group contains , but models based upon it are significantly more complicated. The primary reason for studying models comes from heterotic string theory.

GUT models generically predict the existence of topological defects such as monopoles, cosmic strings, domain walls, and others. But none have been observed. Their absence is known as the monopole problem in cosmology. Many GUT models also predict proton decay, although not the Pati–Salam model. As of now, proton decay has never been experimentally observed. The minimal experimental limit on the proton&#x27;s lifetime pretty much rules out minimal and heavily constrains the other models. The lack of detected supersymmetry to date also constrains many models.

Some GUT theories like and suffer from what is called the doublet-triplet problem. These theories predict that for each electroweak Higgs doublet, there is a corresponding colored Higgs triplet field with a very small mass (many orders of magnitude smaller than the GUT scale here). In theory, unifying quarks with leptons, the Higgs doublet would also be unified with a Higgs triplet. Such triplets have not been observed. They would also cause extremely rapid proton decay (far below current experimental limits) and prevent the gauge coupling strengths from running together in the renormalization group.

Most GUT models require a threefold replication of the matter fields. As such, they do not explain why there are three generations of fermions. Most GUT models also fail to explain the little hierarchy between the fermion masses for different generations.

==Ingredients==
A GUT model consists of a gauge group which is a compact Lie group, a connection form for that Lie group, a Yang–Mills action for that connection given by an invariant symmetric bilinear form over its Lie algebra (which is specified by a coupling constant for each factor), a Higgs sector consisting of a number of scalar fields taking on values within real/complex representations of the Lie group and chiral Weyl fermions taking on values within a complex rep of the Lie group. The Lie group contains the Standard Model group and the Higgs fields acquire VEVs leading to a spontaneous symmetry breaking to the Standard Model. The Weyl fermions represent matter.

==Current evidence==
The discovery of neutrino oscillations indicates that the Standard Model is incomplete, but there is currently no clear evidence that nature is described by any Grand Unified Theory. Neutrino oscillations have led to renewed interest toward certain GUT such as .

One of the few possible experimental tests of certain GUT is proton decay and also fermion masses. There are a few more special tests for supersymmetric GUT. However, minimum proton lifetimes from research (at or exceeding the ~ year range) have ruled out simpler GUTs and most non-SUSY models.

The maximum upper limit on proton lifetime (if unstable), is calculated at 6× years for SUSY models and 1.4× years for minimal non-SUSY GUTs.

The gauge coupling strengths of QCD, the weak interaction and hypercharge seem to meet at a common length scale called the GUT scale and equal approximately to  GeV (slightly less than the Planck energy of  GeV), which is somewhat suggestive. This interesting numerical observation is called the &quot;gauge coupling unification&quot;, and it works particularly well if one assumes the existence of superpartners of the Standard Model particles. Still, it is possible to achieve the same by postulating, for instance, that ordinary (non supersymmetric) models break with an intermediate gauge scale, such as the one of Pati–Salam group.

<text>GTE Corporation, formerly General Telephone &amp; Electronics Corporation (1955–1982), was the largest independent telephone company in the United States during the days of the Bell System. The company operated from 1926, with roots tracing further back than that, until 2000, when it was acquired by Bell Atlantic, which changed its name to Verizon.

The Wisconsin-based Associated Telephone Utilities Company was founded in 1926; it went bankrupt in 1933 during the Great Depression, and was reorganized as General Telephone in 1934. In 1991, it acquired the third largest independent, Continental Telephone (ConTel). It owned Automatic Electric, a telephone equipment supplier similar in many ways to Western Electric, and Sylvania Lighting, the only non-communications-oriented company under GTE ownership. GTE provided local telephone service to many areas of the U.S. through operating companies, much as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph provided local telephone service through its 22 Bell Operating Companies.

The company acquired BBN Planet, one of the earliest Internet service providers, in 1997. That division became known as GTE Internetworking, and was later spun off into the independent company Genuity (a name recycled from another Internet company GTE acquired in 1997) to satisfy Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requirements regarding the GTE–Bell Atlantic merger that created Verizon.

GTE operated in Canada via large interests in subsidiary companies such as BC Tel and Quebec-Téléphone. When foreign ownership restrictions on telecommunications companies were introduced, GTE&#x27;s ownership was grandfathered. When BC Tel merged with Telus (the name given to the privatized Alberta Government Telephones (AGT)) to create BCT.Telus, GTE&#x27;s Canadian subsidiaries were merged into the new parent, making it the second-largest telecommunications carrier in Canada. As such, GTE&#x27;s successor, Verizon Communications, was the only foreign telecommunications company with a greater than 20% interest in a Canadian carrier, until Verizon completely divested itself of its shares in 2004.

In the Caribbean, CONTEL purchased several major stakes in the newly independent countries of the British West Indies (namely in Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago).

Prior to GTE&#x27;s merger with Bell Atlantic, GTE also maintained an interactive television service joint-venture called GTE mainStreet (sometimes also called mainStreet USA) as well as an interactive entertainment and video game publishing operation, GTE Interactive Media.

==History==
===General Telephone===
In 1934, General Telephone Corporation was established with John Winn as president. The following year, the company created General Telephone Directory Company as a division. During World War II, General Telephone helped install phone service for military facilities. From 1946 to 1950, General Telephone obtained over 100,000 telephone lines and bought out Leich Electric Company.

General Telephone&#x27;s holdings included 15 telephone companies across 20 states by 1951, when Donald C. Power was named president of the company under chairman and long-time GT executive Morris F. LaCroix, replacing the retiring Harold Bozell (president 1940 – 1951). Power proceeded to expand the company through the 1950s principally through two acquisitions.

In 1955, Theodore Gary &amp; Company became a part of General Telephone and allowed the company to hold over 2 million telephone lines after the companies merged. It also had a subsidiary, named the General Telephone and Electric Corporation, formed in 1930 with the Transamerica Corporation and British investors to compete against ITT.

In 1959, Sylvania Electric Products merged into General Telephone and was renamed to General Telephone &amp; Electronics Corporation (GT&amp;E). Power also obtained the purchases of multiple companies. such as Lenkurt Electric Company, Inc and Peninsular Telephone Company. In 1960, GT&amp;E International Incorporated was created as a branch company. Power was named C.E.O. and chairman in 1961, making way for Leslie H. Warner, formerly of Theodore Gary, to become president. Simultaneously, GT&amp;E went on to buy Community Antenna Television providers.

In 1964, Western Utilities Corporation became part of GT&amp;E. Additional purchases during the 1960s included Hawaiian Telephone Company and Northern Ohio Telephone Company. At the end of the decade, ten million GT&amp;E phones were active.

In the late 1960s, GT&amp;E joined in the search for a railroad car Automatic Car Identification system. It designed the KarTrak optical system, which won over other manufacturer&#x27;s systems in field trials, but ultimately proved to need too much maintenance. In the late 1970s the system was abandoned.

After a 1970 bomb attack to the company&#x27;s headquarters in New York City, the company relocated to Stamford, Connecticut for their new headquarters. In 1971 GT&amp;E undertook an identity change and became simply GTE, while Sylvania Electric Products became GTE Sylvania. The same year, Donald C. Power retired and Leslie H. Warner became chairman of the board. Theodore F. Brophy was brought in as president.

In 1974, GTE worked with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph in a project to create satellite stations. A few years later, the company&#x27;s international branch was replaced by a GTE products company in 1976. Their products company remained until 1979.
In 1979, GTE purchased Telenet to establish a presence in the growing packet switching data communications business. GTE Telenet was later included in the US Telecom joint venture.

===1980s===
In December 1983 Vanderslice stepped down as the company&#x27;s president and chief operating officer.
In April 1988, after the retirement of Theodore F. Brophy, James L. &quot;Rocky&quot; Johnson was promoted from his position as president and chief operating officer to CEO of GTE; he was appointed chairman in 1991.

Under Johnson&#x27;s leadership, GTE divested its 50% ownership of US Sprint, the nation&#x27;s third largest long-distance company. He also orchestrated the sale of Sylvania and the merger with Contel, creating the 2nd largest telephone company in the United States. 
In 1989, GTE reorganized into six operating groups, focusing on its core businesses of telephone operations, information services, and publishing of telephone directories. With previous job cuts and announced future job cuts, Johnson was able to return GTE to profitability. 
Other new services provided under his leadership were GTE Mobilenet cellular telephone operations, Airfone air-to-ground telephone services, and the first voice, video, and data services community in Cerritos, California to test home banking, at-home shopping, home security, and pay-per-view television in 16,000 homes and 2,000 businesses.

===1990s===
In April 1992, James L. &quot;Rocky&quot; Johnson retired after 43 years at GTE, remaining on the GTE board of directors as chairman emeritus. Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Lee was named to succeed Johnson. In 1994, Lee sold the company&#x27;s satellite provider, Spacenet, to General Electric and Contel of Maine to Oxford Networks, which placed the company into a newly created subsidiary, Oxford West Telephone.

==Merger with Bell Atlantic ==

Bell Atlantic merged with GTE on June 30, 2000, and named the new entity Verizon Communications. The GTE operating companies retained by Verizon became collectively known as Verizon West division of Verizon (including east coast service territories). The remaining smaller operating companies were sold off or transferred into the remaining ones. Additional properties were sold off within a few years after the merger to CenturyTel, Alltel, and Hawaiian Telcom.

On July 1, 2010, Verizon sold many former GTE properties to Frontier Communications. Additional ex-GTE territories in California, Florida, and Texas were sold to Frontier in 2015 and transferred in 2016, ending Verizon&#x27;s landline operations outside of the historic Bell Atlantic footprint.

Verizon still operates phone service in non-Bell System areas in Pennsylvania under Verizon North, and in non-Bell System areas in Virginia and Knotts Island, North Carolina under Verizon South.

In September 2024, Verizon announced a deal to acquire Frontier, which will return much of the former GTE network to Verizon ownership.
==Operating companies==
Prior to the merger with Bell Atlantic, GTE owned the following operating companies in the US:
*Contel of Minnesota, Inc.
*Contel of the South, Inc. (Alabama, Indiana, Michigan)
*GTE Alaska Incorporated
*GTE Arkansas Incorporated
*GTE California Incorporated (Arizona, California, Nevada)
*GTE Florida Incorporated
*GTE Hawaiian Telephone Company, Inc.
*GTE Midwest Incorporated (Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska)
*GTE North Incorporated (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin)
*GTE Northwest Incorporated (Idaho, Oregon, Washington)
*GTE South Incorporated (Illinois, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Wisconsin)
*GTE Southwest Incorporated (Arkansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas)
*GTE West Coast Incorporated (California)

Following the merger of GTE and Bell Atlantic, some of these companies and/or access lines have been sold off to other companies, such as Alltel, ATEAC, The Carlyle Group, CenturyTel, Citizens/Frontier Communications, and Valor Telecom.

<text>General aviation (GA) is defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as all civil aviation aircraft operations except for commercial air transport or aerial work, which is defined as specialized aviation services for other purposes. However, for statistical purposes, ICAO uses a definition of general aviation which includes aerial work.

General aviation thus represents the &quot;private transport&quot; and recreational components of aviation, most of which is accomplished with light aircraft.

==Definition==


The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines civil aviation aircraft operations in three categories: General Aviation (GA), Aerial Work (AW) and Commercial Air Transport (CAT). Aerial work operations are separated from general aviation by ICAO by this definition. Aerial work is when an aircraft is used for specialized services such as agriculture, construction, photography, surveying, observation and patrol, search and rescue, and aerial advertisement. However, for statistical purposes ICAO includes aerial work within general aviation, and has proposed officially extending the definition of general aviation to include aerial work, to reflect common usage. The proposed ICAO classification includes instructional flying as part of general aviation (non-aerial-work).

The International Council of Aircraft Owner and Pilot Associations (IAOPA) refers to the category as general aviation/aerial work (GA/AW) to avoid ambiguity. Their definition of general aviation includes:

*Corporate aviation: company own-use flight operations
*Fractional ownership operations: aircraft operated by a specialized company on behalf of two or more co-owners
*Business aviation (or travel): self-flown for business purposes
*Personal/private travel: travel for personal reasons/personal transport
*Air tourism: self-flown incoming/outgoing tourism
*Recreational flying: powered/powerless leisure flying activities
*Air sports: aerobatics, air races, competitions, rallies, etc.

General aviation thus includes both commercial and non-commercial activities.

IAOPA&#x27;s definition of aerial work includes, but is not limited to: 

*Agricultural flights, including crop dusting
*Banner towing
*Aerial firefighting
*Medical evacuation
*Pilot training
*Search and rescue
*Sight seeing flights
*Skydiving flights
*Organ transplant transport flights

Commercial air transport includes:

*Scheduled air services
*Non-scheduled air transport
*Air cargo services
*Air taxi operations

However, in some countries, air taxi is regarded as being part of GA/AW.

Private flights are made in a wide variety of aircraft: light and ultra-light aircraft, sport aircraft, homebuilt aircraft, business aircraft (like private jets), gliders and helicopters. Flights can be carried out under both visual flight and instrument flight rules, and can use controlled airspace with permission.

The majority of the world&#x27;s air traffic falls into the category of general aviation, and most of the world&#x27;s airports serve GA exclusively. Flying clubs are considered a part of general aviation.

==Geography==
===Europe===

In 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency was established as the central EU regulator, taking over responsibility for legislating airworthiness and environmental regulation from the national authorities.

====United Kingdom====

Of the 21,000 civil aircraft registered in the United Kingdom, 96 percent are engaged in GA operations, and annually the GA fleet accounts for between 1.25 and 1.35 million hours flown. There are 28,000 private pilot licence holders, and 10,000 certified glider pilots. Some of the 19,000 pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in GA activities. GA operates from more than 1,800 airports and landing sites or aerodromes, ranging in size from large regional airports to farm strips.

GA is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority. The main focus is on standards of airworthiness and pilot licensing, and the objective is to promote high standards of safety.

===North America===
General aviation is particularly popular in North America, with over 6,300 airports available for public use by pilots of general aviation aircraft (around 5,200 airports in the U.S. and over 1,000 in Canada). In comparison, scheduled flights operate from around 560 airports in the U.S. According to the U.S. Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, general aviation provides more than one percent of the United States&#x27; GDP, accounting for 1.3 million jobs in professional services and manufacturing.

==Regulation==
Most countries have a civil aviation authority that oversees all civil aviation, including general aviation, adhering to the standardized codes of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

==Safety==
Aviation accident rate statistics are necessarily estimates. According to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, general aviation in the United States (excluding charter) suffered 1.31 fatal accidents for every 100,000 hours of flying in 2005, compared to 0.016 for scheduled airline flights. In Canada, recreational flying accounted for 0.7 fatal accidents for every 1000 aircraft, while air taxi accounted for 1.1 fatal accidents for every 100,000 hours. More experienced GA pilots appear generally safer, although the relationship between flight hours, accident frequency, and accident rates are complex and often difficult to assess.

A small number of commercial aviation accidents in the United States have involved collisions with general aviation flights, notably TWA Flight 553, Piedmont Airlines Flight 22, Allegheny Airlines Flight 853, PSA Flight 182 and Aeroméxico Flight 498.

<doc id="12615" wikidata="Q3135206" url="?curid=12615" title="Gracchi brothers">
<text>The Gracchi brothers were two brothers who lived during the beginning of the late Roman Republic: Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus. They served in the plebeian tribunates of 133 BC and 122–121 BC, respectively. They have been received as well-born and eloquent advocates for social reform who were both killed by a reactionary political system; their terms in the tribunate precipitated a series of domestic crises which are viewed as unsettling the Roman Republic and contributing to its collapse.

Tiberius Gracchus passed legislation which established a commission to survey Roman public land, reassert state claims to it, and redistribute it to poor rural farmers. These reforms were a reaction to a perceived decline in Italy&#x27;s rural population. A decade later, Gaius Gracchus&#x27; reforms, among other things, attempted to buttress Tiberius&#x27; land commission and start Roman colonisation outside of Italy. They also were far more broad, touching on many topics such as assignment of provincial commands, composition of juries for the permanent courts, and letting of state tax farming contracts. Both brothers were killed during or shortly after the conclusion of their respective tribunician terms.

More recent scholarship on the Roman economy has viewed the Gracchi agrarian reforms as less impactful than claimed in the ancient sources. It is also clear that the vast majority of their reformist legislation was left intact rather than repealed. Some modern scholars also connect the agrarian reforms to degrading Rome&#x27;s relations with its Italian allies and the Social War, as the reforms were a reassertion of Roman claims on public land that had been for decades largely occupied without title by Rome&#x27;s Italian allies. Gracchan claims of Italian rural depopulation also are contradicted by archaeological evidence. The impact of the violent reaction to the two brothers, however, is of substantial import: it set a dangerous precedent that violence was an acceptable tool against political enemies.

The Gracchi exerted a substantial influence on later politics. They were viewed alternately as popular martyrs or dangerous demagogues through the late republic. They were also portrayed as social revolutionaries and proto-socialists during the French Revolution and afterwards; in that vein, they motivated social revolutionaries such as François-Noël &quot;Gracchus&quot; Babeuf and opposition to enclosure in Britain. Scholars today view these socialist comparisons as unapt.

== Background ==

It used to be standard view that through the second century BC, the number of free farmers in rural Italy suffered a precipitous decline. This traditional view, transmitted from the ancient sources, &quot;has been much overstated&quot;; the narrative connecting military service to the decline of the yeomanry, moreover, &quot;has to be rejected&quot;. The main driver for this reevaluation is archaeological evidence of Italian settlement patterns from the 1980s onwards: &quot;impressive methodological advances that have been achieved in survey archaeology have ... done much to undermine the credibility of earlier claims concerning the spread of slave-staffed estates and the survival or otherwise of subsistence-oriented smallholders&quot;.

=== Rural conditions, 159–33 BC ===

Through the second century, there is documented some difficulty in raising men and some resistance against levies. This starts in the Third Macedonian War and continues through Roman campaigns in Spain from 151 BC. Roman censuses – which were conducted largely to tally men for conscription – starting in 159 BC also began to note a reduction in the free population of Italy, falling from 328,316 in 159–58 BC down to a low of 317,933 in the census of 136–35 BC. Politicians reacted to these constraints by securing volunteers for service; the reforms of the Gracchi were related to solving this problem and also minimising the impacts of conscription.

However, state difficulties in raising men for war did not mean that there were actual quantitative reductions in the populations of rural Italy. While the census &quot;reported&quot; a reduction in the republic&#x27;s citizen population through the 130s BC, these population reductions were not at the time connected to unwillingness to serve in Rome&#x27;s unpopular campaigns in Spain. Because the easiest way to dodge the draft was to avoid registration by the censors, no &quot;actual&quot; decline in population is necessary to explain censorial reports thereto. The later results of the censuses of 125–24 BC and 115–14 BC, indicate large increases which are incompatible with any actual decline in Italian rural populations.

Archaeological evidence of small farms attested all over Italy in the second century and the general need for free labour during harvest time has led scholars to conclude that &quot;there are no good grounds for inferring a general decline of the small independent farmer in the second century&quot;. The Gracchan narrative of rural population decline through 133 BC – &quot;long since... shown to be false&quot; – likely emerged not from a general and actual decline in rural free-holding, but rather, generalisation from a local decline in coastal Etruria where commercial slave plantations were dominant. And while Gracchan observations of rural poverty were likely true; this, however, was not a result of slave-dominated plantations crowding out poor farmers, but overpopulation under Malthusian conditions.

In rural areas closer to Rome, expanding population and partible inheritance led to the splitting of previously modest farms into plots too small to support families. Many of these small farms were not economically viable. Coupled with the high price of land near Rome, many of these farmers sold their lands to rich men and engaged instead in wage labour. &quot;There is ample evidence to show that the temporary labour of free men was very important to large estates&quot; especially around harvest-time. In the years before 133 BC, a pause in construction of large public monuments also reduced demand for urban labour, triggering a prolonged period of poor labour market conditions. This general economic downturn was likely compounded by years of high food prices due to the ongoing slave revolt in Sicily, an island from which substantial amounts of grain were shipped to Rome.

=== Public land ===
Through the conquests of Italy in the fourth and third centuries BC, the Roman state had acquired legal rights to large amounts of land ceded by the subjugated Italian allies. Their former lands, the &quot;ager publicus&quot;, were not heavily exploited by the Roman state. Rather, the land &quot;had been regarded as a sort of to the allies, who had been allowed to continue to work the land which had been confiscated from them&quot;. Through Roman conquests, the Italians who were allied to Rome were &quot;de facto&quot; confirmed in their lands and also gained substantially from the influx of booty and wealth from Roman conquest.

The traditional narratives in the ancient sources which described the emergence of commercial (enormous slave-staffed plantations owned by the elite) on the public land itself is also largely unattested to by the archaeological evidence in this period. Moreover, evidence indicates that the was largely located outside of the traditional farmlands close to Rome and instead located in non-Roman Italy closer to the Italian allies. Public land redistribution was therefore necessarily at the expense of the allies, who would be evicted from ancestral lands still occupied.

=== Early life of the Gracchi ===

Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus was born 163 BC. His younger brother Gaius was born 154 BC. They were the sons of the Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus who had been consul 177 and 163 BC as well as censor in 169 BC. He had triumphed twice in 178 and 175 BC. Their mother was Cornelia, the daughter of the renowned general Scipio Africanus, the hero of the Second Punic War. Their sister Sempronia also was the wife of Scipio Aemilianus, another important general and politician. Later Roman historians painted Cornelia as an &quot;archetypical Roman matron&quot;, &quot;heavily idealised and inevitably quite distance from the historical Cornelia&quot;, which may be a product of her son Gaius&#x27; own political presentation.

Tiberius&#x27; military career started in 147 BC, serving as a legate or military tribune under his brother-in-law, Scipio Aemilianus during his campaign to take Carthage during the Third Punic War. Tiberius, along with Gaius Fannius, was among the first to scale Carthage&#x27;s walls, serving through to the next year. A decade later, in 137 BC, he was quaestor under the consul Gaius Hostilius Mancinus in Hispania Citerior. The campaign was part of the Numantine War and was unsuccessful; Mancinus and his army lost several skirmishes outside the city before a confused night-time retreat that led them to the site of a camp from a former consular campaign in 153 BC where they were surrounded. Tiberius negotiated a treaty of surrender, aided in part by his father&#x27;s positive reputation built during a praetorship in 179–78 BC; Tiberius&#x27; treaty, however, was later humiliatingly rejected by the senate after his return to Rome.

== Reforms ==

Various reforms had been attempted in the years prior to 133 BC. One of the ones that was successful was the establishment of a secret ballot in 139 BC by the tribune Aulus Gabinius. The circumstances of the reform are no longer known: it was probably presented as an expansion of public liberty and a check against corruption (no longer would those who bribed be able to ensure that recipients voted as instructed). Legislation extending the secret ballot was passed in 137, the , extending the secret ballot to capital cases after Scipio Aemilianus convinced an opposing tribune to heed the people and withdraw his veto.

The introduction of secret ballot was probably one of the necessary conditions for the later Gracchan programme since it insulated the popular assemblies from elite control. For this reason, the historian Harriet Flower, in the 2010 book &quot;Roman republics&quot;, demarcates a political watershed and new phase of the Roman republic at 139 BC. Shortly before Gabinius&#x27; law, in 140 BC, agrarian reforms were proposed by the consul Gaius Laelius Sapiens; but he withdrew his proposals after an invasion (he was assigned as consul to lead the response) and the opposition of the senate, earning him the cognomen .

The ancient historians, especially Plutarch, viewed the Gracchan reforms and brothers as a single unit. Modern scholars have started to view them separately and in their own political contexts.

=== Tiberius ===
Views on Gracchus&#x27; motives differ. Favourable ancient sources attribute his reforms to spirited advocacy for the poor. Less favourable ancient sources, such as Cicero, instead attribute his actions to an attempt to win back and standing after the embarrassing treaty he was forced to negotiate after defeat in Spain. It cannot be doubted that, even if he was a true believer in the need for reform, Tiberius hoped to further his fame and political standing among the elite.

==== Agrarian reforms ====


The main goal of Tiberius&#x27; agrarian proposal was three-fold:
* establish a commission to investigate, survey, and catalogue the land owned by the state,
* limit the amount of public land any one possessor could hold to about 500 , possibly up to 1,000 for those with two children, and
* privatise all remaining land by distributing it to poor Roman citizens (Italians were excluded).

The purpose of the reform was to stimulate population growth and expand the number of people who would meet the property qualifications for service in the Roman army. The inclusion of the limit of 500 was for the purpose of painting the law as a return to and the Sextian-Licinian rogations so to avoid any charges of novelty. Whether the Sextian-Licinian rogations in fact had such a clause is unclear; what mattered to Tiberius and his allies was that they believed it did.

Land distributed was likely done so with a prohibition on alienation and a (rent). Alienation was prohibited to prevent recipients from simply reselling the land. The served to allow the land to revert to the state if a citizen walked away from the allotment; reversion would then allow the state to settle someone else on the land. The (old possessors) also would receive security of tenure over their lands, up to the 500 or 1,000 limit.

Tiberius was supported in his endeavour by likeminded aristocrats who also viewed the perceived problem of rural depopulation seriously – among those in support of the proposal were the consul of 133 BC, Publius Mucius Scaevola, and Scaevola&#x27;s brother, Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus, – he may have been put up to pass the proposals by those allied statesmen. He was also successful in rallying large numbers of rural plebs to Rome to vote in favour of the plan. The proposals were likely not appealing to the urban plebs, who would not have had the agricultural skills necessary to capitalise on the programme.

He was opposed in the assembly by one of the other tribunes, Marcus Octavius. There were largely three grounds for opposition: first, the dispossession would harm the ruling classes of both Rome and the Italian allies; second, the law unfairly dispossessed people who had put money into the improvement of the land; third, that dispossession also would unsettle dowries pledged against the land and inheritances made under the assumption tenure was secure. When the vote arrived and Octavius interposed his tribunician veto, the matter was brought before the senate, but no settlement was reached. Unwilling to back down, Tiberius – unprecedentedly – had the assembly depose Octavius from office and vote the legislation through.

==== Death ====
Violent opposition to Tiberius&#x27; agrarian policy did not come to a head until he moved legislation to use the inheritance of Attalus III of Pergamon for the land commission. The ancient sources differ on the question of what Attalus&#x27; bequest was to be dedicated: Plutarch claims it was to be used to help land recipients purchase farm equipment; Livy, via epitome, claims that it was to be used to purchase more land for distribution after there turned out to be little land available.

This second proposal infringed on senatorial prerogatives over foreign policy and public finances. Senators also feared that these financial handouts would give Tiberius substantial personal political power. Tiberius then announced his intention to stand for re-election; according to Livy, this was illegal, due to a law which forbade holding the same magistracy within ten years. The sources allege that Tiberius also announced plans for a significantly more broad set of reforms, but these may be retrojections of his brother Gaius&#x27; later-consummated proposals. On the day of the election, Tiberius seized the Capitoline hill, possibly to intimidate the voters; Tiberius&#x27; opponents accused him of having kingly aspirations and attempted to induce the consul in the senate to use force to stop his re-election. The consul refused to act extralegally, but one of the other senators, Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio, found this reply unacceptable and led an impromptu military levy of senators, which included one of Tiberius&#x27; colleagues in the plebeian tribunate; with Nasica, who was &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, reenacting an archaic sacrificial ritual, they then stormed the Capitoline and bludgeoned Tiberius and a number of his supporters to death.

It was largely constitutional issues which impelled the violent reaction, not the agrarian laws. The reaction was motivated in part by Greek constitutional thought which created a narrative of popular mobilisation leading inexorably to popular tyranny. Such beliefs were compounded by the recent example of tyranny in Sparta, led by Nabis, which had come to power with a reform programme of cancelling debts and redistributing lands.

==== Effects ====
Tiberius&#x27; and the commission survived his death. Opposition was to Tiberius&#x27; methods rather than his policies; it is likely that most senators agreed with the reform programme in principle. Archaeologists have recovered the commission&#x27;s boundary stones (), which documenting the three commissioners&#x27; activities from 133 to 130 BC. The boundary locations and descriptions imply the distribution over just a few years of some 3,268 square kilometres of land to Roman citizens, concentrated in southern Italy and benefitting some 15,000 households.

The largely name Tiberius&#x27; younger brother Gaius, Appius Claudius Pulcher, and Publius Licinius Crassus. Tiberius appointed himself to the commission, but after his death, Crassus was elected in his place. After the natural deaths of Appius Claudius and Crassus by 130 BC, Marcus Fulvius Flaccus and Gaius Papirius Carbo were elected in their place.

Because one of the commission&#x27;s goals was in reasserting Roman claims to land which by that time had long been occupied by the Italian allies, the allies started to complain of unfairness and inaccurate rushed surveying. In 129, those complaints were heard by the senate, who also took the opportunity to limit the agrarian commission&#x27;s powers. Scipio Aemilianus proposed and received from the senate a decree which assigned the power to determine contested ownership to the consuls. By 129 BC, the commission had over some three years already distributed all the available uncontested land. Archaeological finds of Gracchan largely stop after 129 BC.

=== Gaius ===
Discontent among the Italian allies had grown between Tiberius&#x27; land commission and the later 120s BC. One of the land commissioners elected in the early 120s BC, Marcus Fulvius Flaccus had served as consul in 125 BC and – according to Appian – proposed a compromise giving the allies Roman citizenship in exchange for acquiescence to Roman reassertion of claims to the . This proposal, however, fell through when Flaccus was dispatched to war in Transalpine Gaul; relations with the allies were also not helped by the revolt and destruction of the Latin colony of Fregellae when Flaccus&#x27; proposals were withdrawn.

Gaius positioned himself politically as the inheritor of Tiberius&#x27; popularity and political programme. After a quaestorship, he was elected fourth in the tribunician elections of 124 BC; after his election, he cast his brother&#x27;s death as &quot;a failure by the plebeians to maintain their tradition of defending their tribunes&quot;. Unlike his brother, Gaius&#x27; proposals largely did not relate to land. Over two years, he proposed broad legislation touching all parts of Roman government, from tax collection to senatorial provincial assignments.

==== Reforms ====
During his first tribunate, he proposed a number of laws. First, he proposed legislation to bar anyone who the people had deposed from office from further office. This was, however, dropped at the instigation of his mother Cornelia. The proposal was likely meant to intimidate the other tribunes so they would not exercise their vetoes. He then passed legislation reaffirming &quot;provocatio&quot; rights and retroactively extending them to the sentences of exile which the consular commission in 132 BC had passed against Tiberius&#x27; supporters. Publius Popillius Laenas, the consul who had led the commission and was thereby opened to prosecution for violating those rights, immediately left the city for exile in Campania.

Gaius also moved legislation which would benefit the rich equestrians, especially those who served as Rome&#x27;s public contractors (the &quot;publicani&quot;):
* Gaius changed the bidding location of public tax farming contracts from the provinces to Rome, which increased oversight and favoured high-ranking equites in the capital rather than provincial elites.
* He also passed legislation to build roads, which he would oversee, with contracts let out to the equestrians.
* He also made the dominant body for juries for the permanent court on corruption. After, however, the acquittal of a corrupt consul that year, Gaius, with the support of an allied tribune, made the the sole class staffing the juries.

Gaius also recognised the weakness of Tiberius&#x27; coalition, which relied only on the rural plebs, and therefore sought to expand it. To do so, he courted the urban plebs with legislation establishing Roman colonies both in Italy and abroad at Carthage. He also carried legislation to stop deduction of soldier pay for equipment and to establish a minimum age for conscription at 17. In this package, Gaius also introduced the grain subsidy which allowed all citizens to purchase grain at a subsidised price of six and two-thirds sesterces per .

Further legislation also regulated the magistrates and the senate. Even though the ancient sources generally cast these reforms as part of &quot;an elaborate plot against the authority of the senate... he showed no sign of wanting to replace the senate in its normal functions&quot;. Nor were his reforms meant to undermine the senate indirectly or establish a democracy. Rather, Gaius was seeking to have the senators act more in the public interest rather than in their own private interests. To that end, with an ally in the tribunate, Manlius Acilius Glabrio, he also moved legislation reforming the provincial corruption laws. Also importantly, he passed the , which required the senate to assign consular provinces prior to the elections of the consuls and insulated this decision from tribunician veto.

Some ancient sources claim that Gaius wanted to change voting procedures in the to make it more democratic. However, this claim is dubious and largely rejected.

Gaius made an extremely controversial proposal to improve the state of the Latins and the other Italian allies: the Latins would receive full Roman citizenship with the Italians upgraded to Latin rights. Doing so further extended to Italians, via Latin rights, the right to vote if present in Rome during elections. This proposal died: the specifics are not entirely clear, it may have been vetoed or otherwise simply withdrawn; recent scholarship now trends towards a veto from Livius Drusus. Gaius, after taking some leave to set up a colony near Carthage, attempted to stand for a third tribunate, but was unsuccessful. It is said that he had sufficient popular support to have been elected, but was not returned because the ten tribunician offices had already been filled.

==== Death ====

Early in the year 121 BC, attempts were made to repeal portions of Gaius&#x27; legislation. The main point of repeal, however, was not agrarian legislation or his subsidised grain bill, but the comparatively minor question of the proposed colony at Carthage. After an attendant was killed in the streets by Gaius&#x27; supporters, Gaius and his ally Flaccus were summoned to defend themselves before the senate; they refused and barricaded themselves with armed followers on the Aventine hill. Their refusal was tantamount to rebellion. A &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot; was then moved, instructing the consul Lucius Opimius to ensure the state came to no harm and urging him to suppress Gaius and Flaccus on the Aventine. With a force of militia and Cretan archers, Opimius stormed the Aventine, killing Flaccus and his sons; Gaius was either killed or forced to commit suicide. Opimius then presided over drumhead courts investigating and executing many of Gaius and Flaccus&#x27; supporters.

In the end, most of Gaius&#x27; reforms were preserved; archaeology has discovered evidence of Gracchan land colonial activities in Africa and the land commission remained in operation until 111 BC. By that point, almost all land available to distribute had already been distributed. In the whole, &quot;the aristocracy&#x27;s reaction resembled that of a general dealing with a mutiny, who accedes to most of the demands but executes the ringleaders to preserve discipline&quot;.

== Aftermath ==

=== Gracchan ===

Tiberius&#x27; reforms were focused on the rural peasantry. They were not, however, &quot;so much oppressed as eager (quite justifiably) to share in the increased economic prosperity brought by Roman imperialism&quot;. In general, more recent scholarship has stressed that the ancient sources have exaggerated the extent to which the Roman yeoman farmers were in fact in decline. Tiberius&#x27; reform law was not revolutionary, but his tactics in pursuit of it were, especially when they mobilised the assemblies which gave some genuine expression of the popular will. Those tactics threatened &quot;to break the oligarchic stranglehold on Rome&#x27;s political system, thus leading to his demise&quot;. This was exacerbated by Tiberius&#x27; use of social justice rhetoric, which further set him aside from his aristocratic brethren.

While substantial acreage was distributed as a whole, more than 3,268 square kilometres in the first few years of operation, there is some debate to the extent to which the Gracchan land allotments were actually economically viable for the families placed atop them. However, there are some indications that the lands distributed were used for pasture rather than intensive agriculture, even if they were suitable for farming.

Gaius&#x27; role in land reform is more obscure; the sources are largely unclear on it except in mentioning offhandedly that he brought legislation on the matter. By the time of his tribunate, the census results of 125–24 BC had been published and belief in a depopulation crisis had disappeared. His agrarian reforms likely did little more than grant the agrarian commission – of which he was still a member – the necessary jurisdiction stripped in 129 BC. He was, however, sufficiently visionary to see that further land exactions from Rome&#x27;s allies would seriously damage their interests (and be politically infeasible). This led him, &quot;one of the first to realise that the amount of land in Italy was insufficient to provide for all inhabitants of the peninsula&quot;, to pursue extra-Italian colonisation. This change in scope proved long-lasting and by the time of Caesar, it would be standard policy to establish citizen colonies outside the Italian peninsula, which &quot;would in time prove the only adequate method of finding enough land&quot; for Italy&#x27;s growing populations.

The Gracchan continued in operation through their deaths until 111 BC, which again overhauled Roman policy with public lands. Much of this law survives to the present. Building upon those laws, it abolished the rents that Tiberius&#x27; law passed, making the lands fully private and alienable. By 111 BC, most of the lands that could be distributed already had been; what was left over was &quot;mostly pasture or land which had been assigned to specific people&quot; through long-term leases or set aside for the purpose of providing money for road maintenance. The continuing increase of the Italian population, however, would trigger later proposals for land redistribution; especially notable is Caesar&#x27;s during his consulship in 59 BC, which gave away the to some 20,000 settlers, albeit on less generous terms. After this, it became increasingly clear that there was simply insufficient land in Italy to accommodate demand.

Reassessments of the causes of the Social War have also trended toward viewing the as a major contributing factor. Land holdings in Roman-dominated Italy gave the Roman state a latent title to large swaths of land which had never been formally surveyed. While the Gracchan land commission quickly parcelled and redistributed lands in southern Italy that had been confiscated from the allies that had defected to Hannibal during the Second Punic War, the older lands had been occupied for centuries. Attempts, through to the start of the Social War, to press Roman claims on those lands – which &quot;the allies assumed that they would be able to keep... as long as they did not rebel&quot; – may have greatly undermined allied support for Roman hegemony.

=== Gaius&#x27; urban and administrative reforms ===

Gaius&#x27; reforms were broad and covered large portions of the republic&#x27;s administration. Their main purpose was to advance the quality of Roman government, reducing extortion and corruption among the senatorial governors while acting within the bounds of what his contemporaries would have considered due process.

One of the elements best attested to is Gaius&#x27; , which reformed the on provincial corruption with an equestrian jury to check senatorial governors. The law is preserved on a bronze tablet once owned by Cardinal Pietro Bembo. While, in the long run, the equestrian jury would prove a political issue for the next half century, these reforms were not meant to set the senate and equites into conflict. Nor were they some kind of programme at true popular oversight, as moving the jury from the senators to the equites &quot;merely reallocated influence from one section of the elite to another&quot;. Ernst Badian, writing in the &quot;Oxford Classical Dictionary&quot;, gave the assessment:

His , which created a subsidised grain supply at around what he considered to be a &quot;normal&quot; price, set up an influential model for welfare in Rome. It was a reaction to corn disruptions in recent times that likely developed from army service, but his idea to have the Roman state smooth much of the variability of agriculture put the population less at the mercy of speculators and less dependent on magisterial largesse. The lowered incentives for magistrates giving food away for popularity at home had the added effect of reducing their proclivity to extort corn from provincials. These provisions continued in force after the death of Gaius, suggesting an emerging consensus at Rome that there was a &quot;right of the people to enjoy the rewards of the empire [and that] [were useful] to divert the interest and support of the urban plebs from the prospect of agrarian reform&quot;. After a period of abrogation by Sulla, the dole in the future would expand, however, both in cost and generosity, as later generations of politicians acted with or without senatorial support to do so.

Gaius&#x27; was a similar policy to reduce senatorial corruption and was &quot;far from being revolutionary&quot;: his purpose with the law &quot;was to prevent sitting consuls from using their position to influence provincial assignments improperly (and perhaps to Rome’s detriment)&quot; by requiring provinces to be assigned before the consuls took office. To further insulate such decisions from political meddling, he even made senatorial decisions on consular provinces immune from tribunician veto.

=== Political violence ===

The impact of Tiberius&#x27; murder started a cycle of increased political violence: &quot;the oligarchy had introduced violence into the political system with the murder of Tiberius Gracchus and over the years the use of violence became increasingly acceptable as various political disputes in Rome led to more and more bloody discord&quot;. The use of force to suppress reform also suggested that the republic itself was temperamentally unsuited for producing the types of economic reforms wanted or needed, as in the Gracchi&#x27;s framing, by the people.

In terms of periodisation, the death of Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BC is widely viewed as the start of the &quot;late republic&quot; and the beginning of the republic&#x27;s eventual collapse. For example, in &quot;The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic&quot;, Jürgen von Ungern-Sternberg writes:

Even in ancient times, Cicero remarked as much in saying &quot;the death of Tiberius Gracchus, and even before that the whole rationale behind his tribunate, divided a united people into two distinct groups&quot;. However, scholars such as Mary Beard also warn that Cicero is exaggerating for rhetorical effect and that &quot;the idea there had been a calm consensus at Rome between rich and poor until [133 BC] is at best a nostalgic fiction&quot;.

The death of Gaius as well inaugurated a new tool for the senate in upholding the current order by force: the so-called . Opimius was prosecuted in 120 BC for violating Gaius&#x27; law against extralegal punishment. The ex-consul, however, was able to successfully defend himself by appealing to the senate&#x27;s decree and by arguing that Gaius and Flaccus deserved to be treated as seditious enemies rather than citizens. Opimius&#x27; acquittal set the precedent that the – which was merely advice from the senate: &quot;the senate could pass any decree it liked, it was the magistrate who was responsible for any illegal actions&quot; – was an acceptable ground to vitiate citizen rights extralegally.

== Reception and historiography ==

Views of the Gracchi have changed over time. In the ancient world, the two brothers were largely viewed as an organised force acting in concert. During the early modern period, the Gracchan land programme was widely misconstrued as a socialistic restructuring of Roman society where public and private land ownership would be capped. Modern historians, however, largely view the two brothers&#x27; political activities as separate and dismiss their identification as social revolutionaries.

=== Ancient reception ===

There was a positive and a negative tradition related to the Gracchi brothers. Many of the ancient sources are late – there is a lack of contemporary sources – and are coloured by the positive tradition: many scholars believe that Plutarch&#x27;s biographies of the two men, along with Appian&#x27;s &quot;Civil wars&quot;, are largely based on Gaius Gracchus and his supporters&#x27; narratives; in this, most of what is known of Tiberius is filtered through his brother&#x27;s self-presentation. Plutarch&#x27;s narrative, guided by his literary agenda, &quot;drastically simplifies the [complex] history of this period&quot;. On the whole, Appian&#x27;s narrative is more reliable, but is still marred with significant anachronisms, clear inaccuracies, and schematic features – that the agrarian reform eventually fails and that Tiberius and Gaius pursued the same objectives – which emerge from Appian&#x27;s historiographical agenda.

Some modern scholars speculate that these Gracchan narratives were transmitted through the centuries to the imperial authors by plays which dramatised the tragedy of their deaths. Two major themes stand out. First, the specifics of Gaius&#x27; death are &quot;a dog&#x27;s breakfast&quot; of varying details and involve a Lucius Vitellius, which was a common name during the republic for traitors (according to legend, the Vitellii were the first to betray the republic to the Tarquins shortly after the expulsion of the kings). Second, the stress on friendship and betrayal in these last hours is seen as replacing a more anodyne political drama for heightened pathos. Other scholars, however, disagree, arguing that the hypothesis of lost tragedies is too speculative and instead credit Plutarch or his sources with the dramatisation of the narrative. Regardless, in later generations, the death of the Gracchi became a common rhetorical &quot;topos&quot; in Roman oratorical schools.

The negative tradition, however, is transmitted through other sources, such as Cicero and Valerius Maximus. In these narratives, the Gracchi are painted as seditious tribunes who inaugurated the use of force and intimidation which then required the Roman state to use violence to re-establish order. The confluence of these traditions was common in late republican politics. For example, Cicero modulated his opinions on the Gracchi brothers to meet his audience. Before the senate, he spoke of them negatively and focused on their alleged attempts to take over the republic; before the people, he instead praised their good faith, moral virtues, and quality as orators (especially in comparison to the tribunes of his day).

=== Modern reception ===

By the 17th and 18th centuries, many books on ancient history repeated a false notion that Rome had limited all men to only 500 of land. The incorrect understanding emerged in 1734 with the publication of Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;Considerations on the causes of the greatness of the Romans and their decline&quot;, which furthered this mistaken notion of large scale land reform rather than redistribution of state-owned lots. This led to the characterisation of the Gracchi as &quot;socialists&quot;. Through the later 18th century, the waters became further muddied, until the matter was largely re-cleared by Barthold Georg Niebuhr in his &quot;History of Rome&quot;.

During the French Revolution, the revolutionary François-Noël Babeuf named himself &quot;Gracchus&quot; after the Gracchi brothers, in an attempt to connect his desire for large scale land redistribution with the Gracchan programme for agrarian reform. Babeuf&#x27;s plans, however, differed substantially from the Gracchan programme in ways that exemplify how the reception of the Gracchi had deviated from their actual historical policies. First, Babeuf envisioned the nationalisation and communal ownership of lands, which was incompatible with the Gracchan programme of privatising already state-owned lands. Second, Babeuf&#x27;s choice of name was made under the prevailing assumption at the time that the Gracchi acted to place a limit on &quot;private&quot; land holdings. Finally, Babeuf&#x27;s name demonstrated his belief that a comparison was apt, consistent with contemporary beliefs that the Gracchi were revolutionaries. However, &quot;the truth of the matter was otherwise[:] the Gracchi sought to strengthen and uphold the Roman republic; Babeuf wished to overthrow and radicalise the French republic&quot;.

During the 19th century, the use of the Gracchi in then-current politics continued. The process of enclosure in England, for example, led to the formation of a large body of poor urban workers; many of their leaders were likened to the Gracchi and proposed reforms were compared with reference to the Roman land crisis as described in the ancient sources.

Some 19th and early 20th century scholarship argued that the Gracchi were to some extent influenced by Greek political philosophy, especially in the extent to which Greek democratic principles could be applied at Rome. These influences are largely attributed to Tiberius&#x27; interactions with Stoic egalitarian philosophy through Blossius of Cumae. This is no longer believed, however, as there is little evidence for Tiberius being a Stoic or for Stoicism justfying democratic policies.

<doc id="12616" wikidata="Q854648" url="?curid=12616" title="Gossip">
<text>Gossip is idle talk or rumor, especially about the personal or private affairs of others; the act is also known as dishing or tattling.

==Etymology==
The word is from Old English &quot;godsibb&quot;, from &quot;god&quot; and &quot;sibb&quot;, the term for the godparents of one&#x27;s child or the parents of one&#x27;s godchild, generally very close friends. In the 16th century, the word assumed the meaning of a person, mostly a woman, one who delights in idle talk, a newsmonger, a tattler. In the early 19th century, the term was extended from the talker to the conversation of such persons. The verb &quot;to gossip&quot;, meaning &quot;to be a gossip&quot;, first appears in Shakespeare.

The term originates from the bedroom at the time of childbirth. Giving birth used to be a social event exclusively attended by women. The pregnant woman&#x27;s female relatives and neighbours would congregate and idly converse. Over time, gossip came to mean talk of others.

==Functions==
Gossip can:
* reinforceor punish the lack ofmorality and accountability
* reveal passive aggression, isolating and harming others
* build and maintain a sense of community with shared interests, information, and values
* begin a courtship that helps one find their desired mate, by counseling others
* provide a peer-to-peer mechanism for disseminating information

==Workplace gossip==
Mary Gormandy White, a human resource expert, gives the following &quot;signs&quot; for identifying workplace gossip: 
* Animated people become silent (&quot;Conversations stop when you enter the room&quot;)
* People begin staring at someone
* Workers indulge in inappropriate topics of conversation. 
White suggests &quot;five tips ... [to] handle the situation with aplomb:
# Rise above the gossip
# Understand what causes or fuels the gossip
# Do not participate in workplace gossip.
# Allow for the gossip to go away on its own
# If it persists, &quot;gather facts and seek help.&quot;

Peter Vajda identifies gossip as a form of workplace violence, noting that it is &quot;essentially a form of attack.&quot; Gossip is thought by many to &quot;empower one person while disempowering another&quot; (Hafen).Accordingly, many companies have formal policies in their employee handbooks against gossip. Sometimes there is room for disagreement on exactly what constitutes unacceptable gossip, since workplace gossip may take the form of offhand remarks about someone&#x27;s tendencies such as &quot;He always takes a long lunch,&quot; or &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, that&#x27;s just how she is.&quot;

TLK Healthcare cites as examples of gossip, &quot;tattletaling to the boss without intention of furthering a solution or speaking to co-workers about something someone else has done to upset us.&quot; Corporate email can be a particularly dangerous method of gossip delivery, as the medium is semi-permanent and messages are easily forwarded to unintended recipients; accordingly, a Mass High Tech article advised employers to instruct employees against using company email networks for gossip. Low self-esteem and a desire to &quot;fit in&quot; are frequently cited as motivations for workplace gossip.

There are five essential functions that gossip has in the workplace (according to DiFonzo &amp; Bordia):
* Helps individuals learn social information about other individuals in the organization (often without even having to meet the other individual)
* Builds social networks of individuals by bonding co-workers together and affiliating people with each other.
* Breaks existing bonds by ostracizing individuals within an organization.
* enhances one&#x27;s social status/power/prestige within the organization.
* Inform individuals as to what is considered socially acceptable behavior within the organization.

According to Kurkland and Pelled, workplace gossip can be very serious depending upon the amount of power that the gossiper has over the recipient, which will in turn affect how the gossip is interpreted. There are four types of power that are influenced by gossip:
* Coercive: when a gossiper tells negative information about a person, their recipient might believe that the gossiper will also spread negative information about them. This causes the gossiper&#x27;s coercive power to increase.
* Reward: when a gossiper tells positive information about a person, their recipient might believe that the gossiper will also spread positive information about them. This causes the gossiper&#x27;s reward power to increase.
* Expert: when a gossiper seems to have very detailed knowledge of either the organization&#x27;s values or about others in the work environment, their expert power becomes enhanced.
* Referent: this power can either be reduced OR enhanced to a point. When people view gossiping as a petty activity done to waste time, a gossiper&#x27;s referent power can decrease along with their reputation. When a recipient is thought of as being invited into a social circle by being a recipient, the gossiper&#x27;s referent power can increase, but only to a high point where then the recipient begins to resent the gossiper (Kurland &amp; Pelled).

=== Negative consequences of the gossip ===
Some serious negative consequences of gossip may include:
* Lost productivity and time wasting
* Erosion of trust and morale between members of the working community
* Increased anxiety among employees as rumors circulate without any clear information as to what is fact and what is not
* Growing divisiveness among employees as people &quot;take sides&quot;, risks of &quot;infighting&quot; that may further deteriorate unity
* Hurt feelings and reputations
* Jeopardized chances for the gossipers&#x27; advancement as they are perceived as unprofessional, and
* Attrition: good employees tend leave the company due to the unhealthy work atmosphere and lack of trust
Turner and Weed theorize that among the three main types of responders to workplace conflict are attackers who cannot keep their feelings to themselves and express their feelings by attacking whatever they can. Attackers are further divided into up-front attackers and behind-the-back attackers. Turner and Weed note that the latter &quot;are difficult to handle because the target person is not sure of the source of any criticism, nor even always sure that there is criticism.&quot;

It is possible however, that there may be illegal, unethical, or disobedient behavior happening at the workplace and this may be a case where reporting the behavior may be viewed as gossip. It is then left up to the authority in charge to fully investigate the matter and not simply look past the report and assume it to be workplace gossip.

Informal networks through which communication occurs in an organization are sometimes called the &quot;grapevine&quot;. In a study done by Harcourt, Richerson, and Wattier, it was found that middle managers in several different organizations believed that gathering information from the grapevine was a much better way of learning information than through formal communication with their subordinates (Harcourt, Richerson &amp; Wattier).

==Various views==
Some see gossip as trivial, hurtful and socially, spiritually
and/or intellectually unproductive. Some people view gossip as a lighthearted way of spreading information. Authorities or would-be authorities may have a negative view of gossip as something undesirable or dangerous.
Philosophical analysis by Emrys Westacott points to the role of gossip in (for example) cementing friendships and combatting abuses of power.
A feminist definition of gossip presents it as &quot;a way of talking between women, intimate in style, personal and domestic in scope and setting, a female cultural event which springs from and perpetuates the restrictions of the female role, but also gives the comfort of validation.&quot; (Jones, 1990:243)

===In early modern England===
In early modern England, the word &quot;gossip&quot; referred to companions in childbirth, not limited to the midwife. It also became a term for women-friends generally, with no necessary derogatory connotations. (OED n. definition 2. a. &quot;A familiar acquaintance, friend, chum&quot;, supported by references from 1361 to 1873). It commonly referred to an informal local sorority or social group, who could enforce socially acceptable behavior through private censure or through public rituals, such as &quot;rough music&quot;, the cucking stool and the skimmington ride.

In Thomas Harman&#x27;s &quot;Caveat for Common Cursitors&quot; 1566 a &#x27;walking mort&#x27; relates how she was forced to agree to meet a man in his barn, but informed his wife. The wife arrived with her &quot;five furious, sturdy, muffled gossips&quot; who catch the errant husband with &quot;his hosen [trousers] about his legs&quot; and give him a sound beating. The story clearly functions as a morality tale in which the gossips uphold the social order.

Sir Herbert Maxwell Bart, in &quot;The Chevalier of the Splendid Crest&quot; [1900] at the end of chapter three portrays the king as referring to his loyal knight &quot;Sir Thomas de Roos&quot; in kindly terms as &quot;my old gossip&quot;. Whilst a historical novel of that time the reference implies a continued use of the term &quot;Gossip&quot; as a childhood friend as late as 1900.

===In Judaism===

Judaism considers gossip spoken without a constructive purpose (known in Hebrew as &quot;evil tongue&quot;, &quot;lashon hara&quot;) to be a sin. Speaking negatively about people, even if retelling true facts, counts as sinful, as it demeans the dignity of man — both the speaker and the subject of the gossip.
According to &quot;Proverbs&quot; 18:8: &quot;The words of a gossip are like choice morsels: they go down to a man&#x27;s innermost parts.&quot;

===In Christianity===
The Christian perspective on gossip typically aligns with modern cultural assumptions of the phenomenon, especially with the assumption that generally speaking, gossip is negative speech. However, due to the complexity of the phenomenon, biblical scholars have more precisely identified the form and function of gossip, even identifying a socially positive role for the social process as it is described in the New Testament. Of course, this does not mean that there are &quot;not&quot; numerous texts in the New Testament that see gossip as dangerous negative speech.

Thus, for example, the Epistle to the Romans associates gossips (&quot;backbiters&quot;) with a list of sins including sexual immorality and with murder:
:28: And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;
:29: Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
:30: Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
:31: Without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
:32: Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. (Romans 1:28-32)
According to Matthew 18, Jesus also taught that conflict-resolution among church members ought to begin with the aggrieved party attempting to resolve their dispute with the offending party alone. Only if this did not work would the process escalate to the next step, in which another church member would become involved. After that if the person at fault still would not &quot;hear&quot;, the matter was to be fully investigated by the church elders, and if not resolved to be then exposed publicly.

Based on texts like these portraying gossip negatively, many Christian authors generalize on the phenomenon. So, in order to gossip, writes Phil Fox Rose, we &quot;must harden our heart towards the &#x27;out&#x27; person. We draw a line between ourselves and them; define them as being outside the rules of Christian charity... We create a gap between ourselves and God&#x27;s Love.&quot; As we harden our heart towards more people and groups, he continues, &quot;this negativity and feeling of separateness will grow and permeate our world, and we&#x27;ll find it more difficult to access God&#x27;s love in any aspect of our lives.&quot;

The New Testament is also in favor of group accountability (Ephesians 5:11; 1st Tim 5:20; James 5:16; Gal 6:1-2; 1 Cor 12:26), which may be associated with gossip.

Gossip as a breach of secrecy has parallels with confession: the medieval Christian church sought to control both from its position as a powerful regulator.

===In Islam===

Islam regards backbiting as the equivalent of eating the flesh of one&#x27;s dead brother. According to Muslims, backbiting harms its victims without offering them any chance of defense, just as dead people cannot defend against their flesh being eaten. Muslims are expected to treat others like brothers (regardless of their beliefs, skin-color, gender, or ethnic origin), deriving from Islam&#x27;s concept of brotherhood amongst its believers.

===In the Baháʼí Faith===

The Baháʼí Faith labels backbiting as the &quot;worst human quality and the most great sin...&quot; In their faith, murder would be considered less negative than backbiting. Bahá’u’lláh, the Prophet-Founder of the Baháʼí Faith stated: &quot;Backbiting quencheth the light of the heart, and extinguished the life of the soul.&quot;

==In psychology==

===Evolutionary view===

From Robin Dunbar&#x27;s evolutionary theories, gossip originated to help bond the groups that were constantly growing in size. To survive, individuals need alliances; but as these alliances grew larger, it was difficult if not impossible to physically connect with everyone. Conversation and language were able to bridge this gap. Gossip became a social interaction that helped the group gain information about other individuals without personally speaking to them.  

It enabled people to keep up with what was going on in their social network. It also creates a bond between the teller and the hearer, as they share information of mutual interest and spend time together. It also helps the hearer learn about another individual&#x27;s behavior and helps them have a more effective approach to their relationship. Dunbar (2004) found that 65% of conversations consist of social topics.

Dunbar (1994) argues that gossip is the equivalent of social grooming often observed in other primate species. Anthropological investigations indicate that gossip is a cross-cultural phenomenon, providing evidence for evolutionary accounts of gossip.

There is very little evidence to suggest meaningful sex differences in the proportion of conversational time spent gossiping, and when there is a difference, women are only very slightly more likely to gossip compared with men. Further support for the evolutionary significance of gossip comes from a recent study published in the peer-reviewed journal, Science Anderson and colleagues (2011) found that faces paired with negative social information dominate visual consciousness to a greater extent than positive and neutral social information during a binocular rivalry task.

Binocular rivalry occurs when two different stimuli are presented to each eye simultaneously and the two percepts compete for dominance in visual consciousness. While this occurs, an individual will consciously perceive one of the percepts while the other is suppressed. After a time, the other percept will become dominant and an individual will become aware of the second percept. Finally, the two percepts will alternate back and forth in terms of visual awareness.

The study by Anderson and colleagues (2011) indicates that higher order cognitive processes, like evaluative information processing, can influence early visual processing. That only negative social information differentially affected the dominance of the faces during the task alludes to the unique importance of knowing information about an individual that should be avoided. Since the positive social information did not produce greater perceptual dominance of the matched face indicates that negative information about an individual may be more salient to our behavior than positive.

Gossip also gives information about social norms and guidelines for behavior, usually commenting on how appropriate a behavior was, and the mere act of repeating it signifies its importance. In this sense, gossip is effective regardless of whether it is positive or negative Some theorists have proposed that gossip is actually a pro-social behavior intended to allow an individual to correct their socially prohibitive behavior without direct confrontation of the individual. By gossiping about an individual&#x27;s acts, other individuals can subtly indicate that said acts are inappropriate and allow the individual to correct their behavior (Schoeman 1994).

===Perception of those who gossip===
Individuals who are perceived to engage in gossiping regularly are seen as having less social power and being less liked than those who gossip less frequently. The type of gossip being exchanged also affects likeability, whereby those who engage in negative gossip are less liked than those who engage in positive gossip. In a study done by Turner and colleagues (2003), having a prior relationship with a gossiper was not found to protect the gossiper from less favorable personality-ratings after gossip was exchanged. In the study, pairs of individuals were brought into a research lab to participate. Either the two individuals were friends prior to the study or they were strangers scheduled to participate at the same time. One of the individuals was a confederate of the study, and they engaged in gossiping about the research assistant after she left the room. The gossip exchanged was either positive or negative. Regardless of gossip type (positive versus negative) or relationship type (friend versus stranger) the gossipers were rated as less trustworthy after sharing the gossip.

Walter Block has suggested that while gossip and blackmail both involve the disclosure of unflattering information, the blackmailer is arguably ethically superior to the gossip. Block writes: &quot;In a sense, the gossip is much &quot;worse&quot; than the blackmailer, for the blackmailer has given the blackmailed a chance to silence him. The gossip exposes the secret without warning.&quot; The victim of a blackmailer is thus offered choices denied to the subject of gossip, such as deciding if the exposure of his or her secret is worth the cost the blackmailer demands. Moreover, in refusing a blackmailer&#x27;s offer one is in no worse a position than with the gossip. Adds Block, &quot;It is indeed difficult, then, to account for the vilification suffered by the blackmailer, at least compared to the gossip, who is usually dismissed with slight contempt and smugness.&quot;

Contemporary critiques of gossip may concentrate on or become subsumed in the discussion of social media such as Facebook.

<text>A guitarist (or a guitar player) is a person who plays the guitar. Guitarists may play a variety of guitar family instruments such as classical guitars, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and bass guitars. Some guitarists accompany themselves on the guitar by singing or playing the harmonica, or both.

==Techniques==
The guitarist may employ any of several methods for sounding the guitar, including finger-picking, depending on the type of strings used (either nylon or steel), and including strumming with the fingers, or a guitar pick made of bone, horn, plastic, metal, felt, leather, or paper, and melodic flatpicking and finger-picking.

The guitarist may also employ various methods for selecting notes and chords, including fingering, thumbing, the barre (a finger lying across many or all strings at a particular fret), and guitar slides, usually made of glass or metal. These left- and right-hand techniques may be intermixed in performance.

==Notable guitarists==
===Rock, metal, jazz, country and blues===
Several magazines and websites have compiled what they intend as lists of the greatest guitarists—for example &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, or &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; by &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine.

==== Rolling Stone ====
The first in this list is the American guitarist Jimi Hendrix, introduced by Pete Townshend, guitarist for the Who, who was, in his turn, ranked at #10 in the list.

In describing the list to readers, Paul MacInnes from British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;Surprisingly enough for an American magazine, the top 10 is fair jam-packed with Yanks&quot;, though he also noted three exceptions in the top 10. The online magazine &quot;Blogcritics&quot; criticized the list for introducing some allegedly undeserving guitarists while forgetting some artists the writer considered perhaps more worthy, such as Johnny Marr, Al Di Meola, Phil Keaggy or John Petrucci.

In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; updated the list, which this time was chosen by a panel of guitarists and other experts with the top 100 consisting of Eric Clapton, Eddie Van Halen, Keith Richards and Tony Iommi. Artists who had not been included in the previous list were added. Rory Gallagher, for example, was ranked in 57th place.

&quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; is mentioned in many biographies about artists who appear in the list.

====&quot;Guitar World&quot;====
&quot;Guitar World&quot;, a monthly music magazine devoted to the guitar, also published their list of 100 greatest guitarists in the book &quot;Guitar World Presents the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time from the Pages of Guitar World Magazine&quot;. Different from the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list, which listed guitarists in descending order, &quot;Guitar World&quot; divided guitarists by music genre—such as &quot;Lords of Hard Rock&quot; for hard rock artists or &quot;Jazzmen&quot; for jazz players. Despite the appearance in other magazines like &quot;Billboard&quot;, this publication by &quot;Guitar World&quot; was criticized for including no female musicians within its selection. However, &quot;Guitar World&quot; recently published a list of &quot;Eight Amazing Female Acoustic Players&quot;, including Kaki King, Muriel Anderson and Sharon Isbin.

====&quot;Time&quot; and others====
Following the death of Les Paul, &quot;Time&quot; website presented their list of 10 greatest artists in electric guitar. As in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list, Jimi Hendrix was chosen as the greatest guitarist followed by Slash from Guns N&#x27; Roses, B.B. King, Keith Richards, Jimmy Page, and Eric Clapton. &quot;Gigwise.com&quot;, an online music magazine, also ranks Jimi Hendrix as the greatest guitarist ever, followed by Jimmy Page, B.B. King, Keith Richards and Kirk Hammett.

===Other genres===

The classical guitar is traditionally strung with gut or nylon strings for the treble notes, and wound strings for the bass. Often adorned with mother-of-pearl inlays, the instrument was once primarily played using the fingertips alone. Over time, however, guitarists began to use a combination of fingernail and flesh to achieve a clearer, more expressive sound, and allowing for many different changes in sound quality (or timbre). This guitar tradition dates back at least to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when a four course instrument was popular among aristocrats. In the early nineteenth century there the guitar enjoyed a surge of popularity when composer/performers such as Fernando Sor, Napoléon Coste, Mauro Giuliani, and many others published thousands of pieces for the concert hall and home gatherings. The classical guitar enjoyed another period of popularity in the twentieth century when recordings amplified the relatively quiet instrument. There are many classical guitarists listed as &quot;notable&quot; in their respective epochs.

One of the most renowned flamenco guitarists in recent decades was Paco de Lucía. Flamenco music is a popular traditional music associated with the Andalucia region of southern Spain. It is characterized by intricate syncopated rhythms intimately informed by a gypsy dance style. Flamenco guitarists also often accompany flamenco singers performing &quot;cante jondo&quot; (deep song). De Lucía was also one of the first to have successfully crossed over into other genres of music such as classical and jazz.

The cuatro guitar is a family of Latin American string instruments played in Puerto Rico, Venezuela and other Latin American countries. It is derived from the Spanish guitar. Although some have viola-like shapes, most cuatros resemble a small to mid-sized classical guitar. In Puerto Rico and Venezuela, the cuatro is an ensemble instrument for secular and religious music, and is played at parties and traditional gatherings. Christian Nieves is a Puerto Rican cuatro player and is recognized by the Institute of Puerto Rican culture as the most talented young of their national instrument, the Puerto Rican cuatro.
