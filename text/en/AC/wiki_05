<text>In microeconomics, economies of scale are the cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to their scale of operation, and are typically measured by the amount of output produced per unit of cost (production cost). A decrease in cost per unit of output enables an increase in scale that is, increased production with lowered cost. At the basis of economies of scale, there may be technical, statistical, organizational or related factors to the degree of market control.

Economies of scale arise in a variety of organizational and business situations and at various levels, such as a production, plant or an entire enterprise. When average costs start falling as output increases, then economies of scale occur. Some economies of scale, such as capital cost of manufacturing facilities and friction loss of transportation and industrial equipment, have a physical or engineering basis. The economic concept dates back to Adam Smith and the idea of obtaining larger production returns through the use of division of labor. Diseconomies of scale are the opposite.

Economies of scale often have limits, such as passing the optimum design point where costs per additional unit begin to increase. Common limits include exceeding the nearby raw material supply, such as wood in the lumber, pulp and paper industry. A common limit for a low cost per unit weight raw materials is saturating the regional market, thus having to ship products uneconomic distances. Other limits include using energy less efficiently or having a higher defect rate.

Large producers are usually efficient at long runs of a product grade (a commodity) and find it costly to switch grades frequently. They will, therefore, avoid specialty grades even though they have higher margins. Often smaller (usually older) manufacturing facilities remain viable by changing from commodity-grade production to specialty products. Economies of scale must be distinguished from economies stemming from an increase in the production of a given plant. When a plant is used below its optimal production capacity, increases in its degree of utilization bring about decreases in the total average cost of production. Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (1966) and Nicholas Kaldor (1972) both argue that these economies should not be treated as economies of scale.

==Overview==
The simple meaning of economies of scale is doing things more efficiently with increasing size. Common sources of economies of scale are purchasing (bulk buying of materials through long-term contracts), managerial (increasing the specialization of managers), financial (obtaining lower-interest charges when borrowing from banks and having access to a greater range of financial instruments), marketing (spreading the cost of advertising over a greater range of output in media markets), and technological (taking advantage of returns to scale in the production function). Each of these factors reduces the long run average costs (LRAC) of production by shifting the short-run average total cost (SRATC) curve down and to the right.

Economies of scale is a concept that may explain patterns in international trade or in the number of firms in a given market. The exploitation of economies of scale helps explain why companies grow large in some industries. It is also a justification for free trade policies, since some economies of scale may require a larger market than is possible within a particular country—for example, it would not be efficient for Liechtenstein to have its own carmaker if they only sold to their local market. A lone carmaker may be profitable, but even more so if they exported cars to global markets in addition to selling to the local market. Economies of scale also play a role in a &quot;natural monopoly&quot;. There is a distinction between two types of economies of scale: internal and external. An industry that exhibits an internal economy of scale is one where the costs of production fall when the number of firms in the industry drops, but the remaining firms increase their production to match previous levels. Conversely, an industry exhibits an external economy of scale when costs drop due to the introduction of more firms, thus allowing for more efficient use of specialized services and machinery.

Economies of scale exist whenever the total cost of producing two quantities of a product X is lower when a single firm instead of two separate firms produce it. See Economies of scope#Economics.

==Determinants of economies of scale==
===Physical and engineering basis: economies of increased dimension===
Some of the economies of scale recognized in engineering have a physical basis, such as the square–cube law, by which the surface of a vessel increases by the square of the dimensions while the volume increases by the cube. This law has a direct effect on the capital cost of such things as buildings, factories, pipelines, ships and airplanes.

In structural engineering, the strength of beams increases with the cube of the thickness.

Drag loss of vehicles like aircraft or ships generally increases less than proportional with increasing cargo volume, although the physical details can be quite complicated. Therefore, making them larger usually results in less fuel consumption per ton of cargo at a given speed.

Heat loss from industrial processes vary per unit of volume for pipes, tanks and other vessels in a relationship somewhat similar to the square–cube law. In some productions, an increase in the size of the plant reduces the average variable cost, thanks to the energy savings resulting from the lower dispersion of heat.

Economies of increased dimension are often misinterpreted because of the confusion between indivisibility and three-dimensionality of space. This confusion arises from the fact that three-dimensional production elements, such as pipes and ovens, once installed and operating, are always technically indivisible. However, the economies of scale due to the increase in size do not depend on indivisibility but exclusively on the three-dimensionality of space. Indeed, indivisibility only entails the existence of economies of scale produced by the balancing of productive capacities, considered above; or of increasing returns in the utilisation of a single plant, due to its more efficient use as the quantity produced increases. However, this latter phenomenon has nothing to do with the economies of scale which, by definition, are linked to the use of a larger plant.

===Economies in holding stocks and reserves===
At the base of economies of scale there are also returns to scale linked to statistical factors. In fact, the greater of the number of resources involved, the smaller, in proportion, is the quantity of reserves necessary to cope with unforeseen contingencies (for instance, machine spare parts, inventories, circulating capital, etc.).

===Transaction economies===
One of the reasons firms appear is to reduce transaction costs. A larger scale generally determines greater bargaining power over input prices and therefore benefits from pecuniary economies in terms of purchasing raw materials and intermediate goods compared to companies that make orders for smaller amounts. In this case, we speak of pecuniary economies, to highlight the fact that nothing changes from the &quot;physical&quot; point of view of the returns to scale. Furthermore, supply contracts entail fixed costs which lead to decreasing average costs if the scale of production increases. This is of important utility in the study of corporate finance.

===Economies deriving from the balancing of production capacity===
Economies of productive capacity balancing derives from the possibility that a larger scale of production involves a more efficient use of the production capacities of the individual phases of the production process. If the inputs are indivisible and complementary, a small scale may be subject to idle times or to the underutilization of the productive capacity of some sub-processes. A higher production scale can make the different production capacities compatible. The reduction in machinery idle times is crucial in the case of a high cost of machinery.

===Economies resulting from the division of labour and the use of superior techniques===
A larger scale allows for a more efficient division of labour. The economies of division of labour derive from the increase in production speed, from the possibility of using specialized personnel and adopting more efficient techniques. An increase in the division of labour inevitably leads to changes in the quality of inputs and outputs.

===Managerial economics===
Many administrative and organizational activities are mostly cognitive and, therefore, largely independent of the scale of production. When the size of the company and the division of labour increase, there are a number of advantages due to the possibility of making organizational management more effective and perfecting accounting and control techniques. Furthermore, the procedures and routines that turned out to be the best can be reproduced by managers at different times and places.

===Learning and growth economies===
Learning and growth economies are at the base of dynamic economies of scale, associated with the process of growth of the scale dimension and not to the dimension of scale per se. Learning by doing implies improvements in the ability to perform and promotes the introduction of incremental innovations with a progressive lowering of average costs. Learning economies are directly proportional to the cumulative production (experience curve).
Growth economies emerge if a company gains an added benefit by expanding its size. These economies are due to the presence of some resource or competence that is not fully utilized, or to the existence of specific market positions that create a differential advantage in expanding the size of the firms. That growth economies disappear once the scale size expansion process is completed. For example, a company that owns a supermarket chain benefits from an economy of growth if, opening a new supermarket, it gets an increase in the price of the land it owns around the new supermarket. The sale of these lands to economic operators, who wish to open shops near the supermarket, allows the company in question to make a profit, making a profit on the revaluation of the value of building land.

===Capital and operating cost===
Overall costs of capital projects are known to be subject to economies of scale. A crude estimate is that if the capital cost for a given sized piece of equipment is known, changing the size will change the capital cost by the 0.6 power of the capacity ratio (the point six to the power rule).

In estimating capital cost, it typically requires an insignificant amount of labor, and possibly not much more in materials, to install a larger capacity electrical wire or pipe having significantly greater capacity.

The cost of a unit of capacity of many types of equipment, such as electric motors, centrifugal pumps, diesel and gasoline engines, decreases as size increases. Also, the efficiency increases with size.

===Crew size and other operating costs for ships, trains and airplanes===

Operating crew size for ships, airplanes, trains, etc., does not increase in direct proportion to capacity. (Operating crew consists of pilots, co-pilots, navigators, etc. and does not include passenger service personnel.) Many aircraft models were significantly lengthened or &quot;stretched&quot; to increase payload.

Many manufacturing facilities, especially those making bulk materials like chemicals, refined petroleum products, cement and paper, have labor requirements that are not greatly influenced by changes in plant capacity. This is because labor requirements of automated processes tend to be based on the complexity of the operation rather than production rate, and many manufacturing facilities have nearly the same basic number of processing steps and pieces of equipment, regardless of production capacity.

===Economical use of byproducts===

Karl Marx noted that large scale manufacturing allowed economical use of products that would otherwise be waste. Marx cited the chemical industry as an example, which today along with petrochemicals, remains highly dependent on turning various residual reactant streams into salable products. In the pulp and paper industry, it is economical to burn bark and fine wood particles to produce process steam and to recover the spent pulping chemicals for conversion back to a usable form.

===Economies of scale and the size of exporter===
Large and more productive firms typically generate enough net revenues abroad to cover the fixed costs associated with exporting. However, in the event of trade liberalization, resources will have to be reallocated toward the more productive firm, which raises the average productivity within the industry. 

Firms differ in their labor productivity and the quality of their products, so more efficient firms are more likely to generate more net income abroad and thus become exporters of their goods or services. There is a correlating relationship between a firm&#x27;s total sales and underlying efficiency. Firms with higher productivity will always outperform a firm with lower productivity which will lead to lower sales. Through trade liberalization, organizations are able to drop their trade costs due to export growth. However, trade liberalization does not account for any tariff reduction or shipping logistics improvement. However, total economies of scale is based on the exporters individual frequency and size. So large-scale companies are more likely to have a lower cost per unit as opposed to small-scale companies. Likewise, high trade frequency companies are able to reduce their overall cost attributed per unit when compared to those of low-trade frequency companies.

==Economies of scale and returns to scale==

Economies of scale is related to and can easily be confused with the theoretical economic notion of returns to scale. Where economies of scale refer to a firm&#x27;s costs, returns to scale describe the relationship between inputs and outputs in a long-run (all inputs variable) production function. A production function has &quot;constant&quot; returns to scale if increasing all inputs by some proportion results in output increasing by that same proportion. Returns are &quot;decreasing&quot; if, say, doubling inputs results in less than double the output, and &quot;increasing&quot; if more than double the output. If a mathematical function is used to represent the production function, and if that production function is homogeneous, returns to scale are represented by the degree of homogeneity of the function. Homogeneous production functions with constant returns to scale are first degree homogeneous, increasing returns to scale are represented by degrees of homogeneity greater than one, and decreasing returns to scale by degrees of homogeneity less than one.

If the firm is a perfect competitor in all input markets, and thus the per-unit prices of all its inputs are unaffected by how much of the inputs the firm purchases, then it can be shown that at a particular level of output, the firm has economies of scale if and only if it has increasing returns to scale, has diseconomies of scale if and only if it has decreasing returns to scale, and has neither economies nor diseconomies of scale if it has constant returns to scale. In this case, with perfect competition in the output market the long-run equilibrium will involve all firms operating at the minimum point of their long-run average cost curves (i.e., at the borderline between economies and diseconomies of scale).

If, however, the firm is not a perfect competitor in the input markets, then the above conclusions are modified. For example, if there are increasing returns to scale in some range of output levels, but the firm is so big in one or more input markets that increasing its purchases of an input drives up the input&#x27;s per-unit cost, then the firm could have diseconomies of scale in that range of output levels. Conversely, if the firm is able to get bulk discounts of an input, then it could have economies of scale in some range of output levels even if it has decreasing returns in production in that output range.

In essence, returns to scale refer to the variation in the relationship between inputs and output. This relationship is therefore expressed in &quot;physical&quot; terms. But when talking about economies of scale, the relation taken into consideration is that between the average production cost and the dimension of scale. Economies of scale therefore are affected by variations in input prices. If input prices remain the same as their quantities purchased by the firm increase, the notions of increasing returns to scale and economies of scale can be considered equivalent. However, if input prices vary in relation to their quantities purchased by the company, it is necessary to distinguish between returns to scale and economies of scale. The concept of economies of scale is more general than that of returns to scale since it includes the possibility of changes in the price of inputs when the quantity purchased of inputs varies with changes in the scale of production.

The literature assumed that due to the competitive nature of reverse auctions, and in order to compensate for lower prices and lower margins, suppliers seek higher volumes to maintain or increase the total revenue. Buyers, in turn, benefit from the lower transaction costs and economies of scale that result from larger volumes. In part as a result, numerous studies have indicated that the procurement volume must be sufficiently high to provide sufficient profits to attract enough suppliers, and provide buyers with enough savings to cover their additional costs.

However, Shalev and Asbjornse found, in their research based on 139 reverse auctions conducted in the public sector by public sector buyers, that the higher auction volume, or economies of scale, did not lead to better success of the auction. They found that auction volume did not correlate with competition, nor with the number of bidders, suggesting that auction volume does not promote additional competition. They noted, however, that their data included a wide range of products, and the degree of competition in each market varied significantly, and offer that further research on this issue should be conducted to determine whether these findings remain the same when purchasing the same product for both small and high volumes. Keeping competitive factors constant, increasing auction volume may further increase competition.

==Economies of scale in the history of economic analysis==
===Economies of scale in classical economists===
The first systematic analysis of the advantages of the division of labour capable of generating economies of scale, both in a static and dynamic sense, was that contained in the famous First Book of Wealth of Nations (1776) by Adam Smith, generally considered the founder of political economy as an autonomous discipline.

John Stuart Mill, in Chapter IX of the First Book of his Principles, referring to the work of Charles Babbage (On the economics of machines and manufactories), widely analyses the relationships between increasing returns and scale of production all inside the production unit.

===Economies of scale in Marx and distributional consequences ===
In (1867), Karl Marx, referring to Charles Babbage, extensively analyzed economies of scale and concludes that they are one of the factors underlying the ever-increasing concentration of capital. Marx observes that in the capitalist system the technical conditions of the work process are continuously revolutionized in order to increase the surplus by improving the productive force of work. According to Marx, with the cooperation of many workers brings about an economy in the use of the means of production and an increase in productivity due to the increase in the division of labour. Furthermore, the increase in the size of the machinery allows significant savings in construction, installation and operation costs. The tendency to exploit economies of scale entails a continuous increase in the volume of production which, in turn, requires a constant expansion of the size of the market. However, if the market does not expand at the same rate as production increases, overproduction crises can occur. According to Marx the capitalist system is therefore characterized by two tendencies, connected to economies of scale: towards a growing concentration and towards economic crises due to overproduction.

In his 1844 &quot;Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts&quot;, Karl Marx observes that economies of scale have historically been associated with an increasing concentration of private wealth and have been used to justify such concentration. Marx points out that concentrated private ownership of large-scale economic enterprises is a historically contingent fact, and not essential to the nature of such enterprises. In the case of agriculture, for example, Marx calls attention to the nature of the arguments used to justify the system of concentrated ownership of land:

: As for large landed property, its defenders have always sophistically identified the economic advantages offered by large-scale agriculture with large-scale landed property, as if it were not precisely as a result of the abolition of property that this advantage, for one thing, received its greatest possible extension, and, for another, only then would be of social benefit.

Instead of concentrated private ownership of land, Marx recommends that economies of scale should instead be realized by associations:

:Association, applied to land, shares the economic advantage of large-scale landed property, and first brings to realization the original tendency inherent in land-division, namely, equality. In the same way association re-establishes, now on a rational basis, no longer mediated by serfdom, overlordship and the silly mysticism of property, the intimate ties of man with the earth, for the earth ceases to be an object of huckstering, and through free labor and free enjoyment becomes once more a true personal property of man.

===Economies of scale in Marshall===
Alfred Marshall notes that Antoine Augustin Cournot and others have considered &quot;the internal economies [...] apparently without noticing that their premises lead inevitably to the conclusion that, whatever firm first gets a good start will obtain a monopoly of the whole business of its trade … &quot;. Marshall believes that there are factors that limit this trend toward monopoly, and in particular:
* the death of the founder of the firm and the difficulty that the successors may have inherited his/her entrepreneurial skills;
* the difficulty of reaching new markets for one&#x27;s goods;
* the growing difficulty of being able to adapt to changes in demand and to new techniques of production;
* The effects of external economies, that is the particular type of economies of scale connected not to the production scale of an individual production unit, but to that of an entire sector.

===Sraffa&#x27;s critique===
Piero Sraffa observes that Marshall, in order to justify the operation of the law of increasing returns without it coming into conflict with the hypothesis of free competition, tended to highlight the advantages of external economies linked to an increase in the production of an entire sector of activity. However, &quot;those economies which are external from the point of view of the individual firm, but internal as regards the industry in its aggregate, constitute precisely the class which is most seldom to be met with.&quot; &quot;In any case - Sraffa notes – in so far as external economies of the kind in question exist, they are not linked to be called forth by small increases in production,&quot; as required by the marginalist theory of price. Sraffa points out that, in the equilibrium theory of the individual industries, the presence of external economies cannot play an important role because this theory is based on marginal changes in the quantities produced.

Sraffa concludes that, if the hypothesis of perfect competition is maintained, economies of scale should be excluded. He then suggests the possibility of abandoning the assumption of free competition to address the study of firms that have their own particular market. This stimulated a whole series of studies on the cases of imperfect competition in Cambridge. However, in the succeeding years Sraffa followed a different path of research that brought him to write and publish his main work &quot;Production of commodities by means of commodities&quot; . In this book, Sraffa determines relative prices assuming no changes in output, so that no question arises as to the variation or constancy of returns.

=== Rule of six-tenths ===
In 1947, DuPont engineer Roger Williams, Jr. (1930-2005) published a rule of thumb that costs of chemical process are roughly proportional to the tonnage in power ~0.6. In the following decades it became widely adopted other engineering industries and terrestrial mining, sometimes (e. g., in electrical power generation) with modified exponential scaling factors.

===Economies of scale and the tendency towards monopoly: &quot;Cournot&#x27;s dilemma&quot;===
It has been noted that in many industrial sectors there are numerous companies with different sizes and organizational structures, despite the presence of significant economies of scale. This contradiction, between the empirical evidence and the logical incompatibility between economies of scale and competition, has been called the &#x27;Cournot dilemma&#x27;. As Mario Morroni observes, Cournot&#x27;s dilemma appears to be unsolvable if we only consider the effects of economies of scale on the dimension of scale. If, on the other hand, the analysis is expanded, including the aspects concerning the development of knowledge and the organization of transactions, it is possible to conclude that economies of scale do not always lead to monopoly. In fact, the competitive advantages deriving from the development of the firm&#x27;s capabilities and from the management of transactions with suppliers and customers can counterbalance those provided by the scale, thus counteracting the tendency towards a monopoly inherent in economies of scale. In other words, the heterogeneity of the organizational forms and of the size of the companies operating in a sector of activity can be determined by factors regarding the quality of the products, the production flexibility, the contractual methods, the learning opportunities, the heterogeneity of preferences of customers who express a differentiated demand with respect to the quality of the product, and assistance before and after the sale. Very different organizational forms can therefore co-exist in the same sector of activity, even in the presence of economies of scale, such as, for example, flexible production on a large scale, small-scale flexible production, mass production, industrial production based on rigid technologies associated with flexible organizational systems and traditional artisan production. The considerations regarding economies of scale are therefore important, but not sufficient to explain the size of the company and the market structure. It is also necessary to take into account the factors linked to the development of capabilities and the management of transaction costs.

==External economies of scale==
External economies of scale tend to be more prevalent than internal economies of scale. Through the external economies of scale, the entry of new firms benefits all existing competitors as it creates greater competition and also reduces the average cost for all firms as opposed to internal economies of scale which only allows benefits to the individual firm. Advantages that arise from external economies of scale include; 
* Expansion of the industry.
* Benefits most or all of the firms within the industry. 
* Can lead to rapid growth of local governments.
==Sources==
===Purchasing===
Firms are able to lower their average costs by buying their inputs required for the production process in bulk or from special wholesalers. 

===Managerial===
Firms might be able to lower their average costs by improving their management structure within the firm. This can range from hiring better skilled or more experienced managers from the industry.

===Technological===
Technological advancements change production processes and subsequently reduce the overall cost per unit. Tim Hindle argues that the rollout of the internet &quot;has completely reshaped the assumptions underlying economies of scale&quot;.

<text>Eliezer &quot;Elie&quot; Wiesel (September 30, 1928 – July 2, 2016) was a Romanian-born American writer, professor, political activist, Nobel laureate, and Holocaust survivor. He authored 57 books, written mostly in French and English, including &quot;Night&quot;, a work based on his experiences as a Jewish prisoner in the Auschwitz and Buchenwald concentration camps.

In his political activities Wiesel became a regular speaker on the subject of the Holocaust and remained a strong defender of human rights during his lifetime. He also advocated for victims of oppression including Soviet and Ethiopian Jews, the apartheid in South Africa, the Bosnian genocide, Sudan, the Kurds and the Armenian genocide, Argentina&#x27;s Desaparecidos or Nicaragua&#x27;s Miskito people. He was a strong supporter of the state of Israel and was personally close to Benjamin Netanyahu.

He was a professor of the humanities at Boston University, which created the Elie Wiesel Center for Jewish Studies in his honor. He helped establish the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.

Wiesel received awards including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986. He was a founding board member of the New York Human Rights Foundation and remained active in it throughout his life.

==Early life==

Eliezer Wiesel was born in Sighet (now Sighetu Marmației), Maramureș, in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania. His parents were Sarah Feig and Shlomo Wiesel. At home, Wiesel&#x27;s family spoke Yiddish most of the time, but also German, Hungarian, and Romanian. Wiesel&#x27;s mother, Sarah, was the daughter of Dodye Feig, a Vizhnitz Hasid and farmer from the nearby village of Bocskó. Dodye was active and trusted within the community.

Wiesel&#x27;s father, Shlomo, instilled a strong sense of humanism in his son, encouraging him to learn Hebrew and to read literature, whereas his mother encouraged him to study the Torah. Wiesel said his father represented reason, while his mother Sarah promoted faith. Wiesel was instructed that his genealogy traced back to Rabbi Schlomo Yitzhaki (Rashi), and was a descendant of Rabbi Yeshayahu ben Abraham Horovitz ha-Levi.

Wiesel had three siblings—older sisters Beatrice and Hilda, and younger sister Tzipora. Beatrice and Hilda survived the war, and were reunited with Wiesel at a French orphanage. They eventually emigrated to North America, with Beatrice moving to Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Tzipora, Shlomo, and Sarah did not survive the Holocaust.

==Imprisonment and orphaning during the Holocaust==
In March 1944, Germany occupied Hungary, thus extending the Holocaust into Northern Transylvania as well. Wiesel was 15, and he, with his family, along with the rest of the town&#x27;s Jewish population, was placed in one of the two confinement ghettos set up in Máramarossziget (Sighet), the town where he had been born and raised. In May 1944, the Hungarian authorities, under German pressure, began to deport the Jewish community to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where up to 90 percent of the people were murdered on arrival.

Immediately after they were sent to Auschwitz, his mother and his younger sister were murdered in the gas chambers. Wiesel and his father were selected to perform labor so long as they remained able-bodied, after which they were to be murdered in the gas chambers. Wiesel and his father were later deported to the concentration camp at Buchenwald. Until that transfer, he admitted to Oprah Winfrey, his primary motivation for trying to survive Auschwitz was knowing that his father was still alive: &quot;I knew that if I died, he would die.&quot; After they were taken to Buchenwald, his father died before the camp was liberated. In &quot;Night&quot;, Wiesel recalled the shame he felt when he heard his father being beaten and was unable to help.

Wiesel was tattooed with inmate number &quot;A-7713&quot; on his left arm. The camp was liberated by the U.S. Third Army on April 11, 1945, when they were just prepared to be evacuated from Buchenwald.

== March of the Living ==
The March of the Living is an annual educational program that has brought over 300,000 participants from around the world to Poland, where they visit historical sites of the Holocaust, make a two-mile trek from Auschwitz to the former extermination site of Birkenau. Students learn about the experience through live testimony from survivors. Wiesel participated in the first March of the Living in 1988, during its founding year. Wiesel also attended in 1990, and in 2005, during the 60th anniversary of the end of WWII. Wiesel addressed over 18,000 in attendance. It was the biggest event in the program&#x27;s history .

On the 1990 March of the Living, Elie Wiesel addressed the participants at Auschwitz about his concerns about antisemitism. He stated, &quot;We were convinced that antisemitism perished here. Antisemitism did not perish here; its victims perished here.&quot; He started to share a story of a young girl, paused, and left the stage. The footage stated Wiesel was simply unable to continue the story. The corroborating article from Eli Rubenstein, who was in attendance that day described that even &quot;the world&#x27;s most eloquent witness to the Holocaust,&quot; was not able to convey the story that led to the fate of this young girl. 

in 2017, Wiesel&#x27;s son, Elisha participated in the March of the Living in memory of his father, honoring his legacy. Since his father&#x27;s passing, he has spoken at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum and Auschwitz, and has begun working on his late father&#x27;s foundation, the Elie Wiesel Foundation.

Wiesel is included in the publication &quot;.&quot; Along with his picture from when he was imprisoned at Buchenwald, he was quoted from the 1990 March of the Living: 

==Post-war career as a writer==
===France===
After World War II ended and Wiesel was freed, he joined a transport of 1,000 child survivors of Buchenwald to Ecouis, France, where the Œuvre de secours aux enfants (OSE) had established a rehabilitation center. Wiesel joined a smaller group of 90 to 100 boys from Orthodox homes who wanted kosher facilities and a higher level of religious observance; they were cared for in a home in Ambloy under the directorship of Judith Hemmendinger. This home was later moved to Taverny and operated until 1947.

Afterwards, Wiesel traveled to Paris where he learned French and studied literature, philosophy and psychology at the Sorbonne. He heard lectures by philosopher Martin Buber and existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre and he spent his evenings reading works by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Franz Kafka, and Thomas Mann.

By the time he was 19, he had begun working as a journalist, writing in French, while also teaching Hebrew and working as a choirmaster. He wrote for Israeli and French newspapers, including &quot;Tsien in Kamf&quot; (in Yiddish).

In 1946, after learning of the Irgun&#x27;s bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, Wiesel made an unsuccessful attempt to join the underground Zionist movement. In 1948, he translated articles from Hebrew into Yiddish for Irgun periodicals, but never became a member of the organization. In 1949, he traveled to Israel as a correspondent for the French newspaper &quot;L&#x27;arche&quot;. He then was hired as Paris correspondent for the Israeli newspaper &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot;, subsequently becoming its roaming international correspondent.

For ten years after the war, Wiesel refused to write about or discuss his experiences during the Holocaust. He began to reconsider his decision after a meeting with the French author François Mauriac, the 1952 Nobel Laureate in Literature who eventually became Wiesel&#x27;s close friend. Mauriac was a devout Christian who had fought in the French Resistance during the war. He compared Wiesel to &quot;Lazarus rising from the dead&quot;, and saw from Wiesel&#x27;s tormented eyes, &quot;the death of God in the soul of a child&quot;. Mauriac persuaded him to begin writing about his harrowing experiences.

Wiesel first wrote the 900-page memoir &quot;Un di velt hot geshvign&quot; (&quot;And the World Remained Silent&quot;) in Yiddish, which was published in abridged form in Buenos Aires. Wiesel rewrote a shortened version of the manuscript in French, &quot;La Nuit&quot;, in 1955. It was translated into English as &quot;Night&quot; in 1960. The book sold few copies after its initial publication, but still attracted interest from reviewers, leading to television interviews with Wiesel and meetings with writers such as Saul Bellow.

As its profile rose, &quot;Night&quot; was eventually translated into 30 languages with ten million copies sold in the United States. At one point film director Orson Welles wanted to make it into a feature film, but Wiesel refused, feeling that his memoir would lose its meaning if it were told without the silences in between his words. Oprah Winfrey made it a spotlight selection for her book club in 2006.

===United States===
In 1955, Wiesel moved to New York as foreign correspondent for the Israel daily, &quot;Yediot Ahronot&quot;. In 1969, he married Austrian Marion Erster Rose, who also translated many of his books. They had one son, Shlomo Elisha Wiesel, named after Wiesel&#x27;s father.

In the U.S., he eventually wrote over 40 books, most of them non-fiction Holocaust literature, and novels. As an author, he was awarded a number of literary prizes and is considered among the most important in describing the Holocaust from a highly personal perspective. As a result, some historians credited Wiesel with giving the term &quot;&quot; its present meaning, although he did not feel that the word adequately described that historical event. In 1975, he co-founded the magazine &quot;Moment&quot; with writer Leonard Fein.

The 1979 book and play &quot;The Trial of God&quot; are said to have been based on his real-life Auschwitz experience of witnessing three Jews who, close to death, conduct a trial against God, under the accusation that He has been oppressive towards the Jewish people.

Wiesel also played a role in the initial success of &quot;The Painted Bird&quot; by Jerzy Kosinski by endorsing it before it became known the book was fiction and, in the sense that it was presented as all Kosinski&#x27;s true experience, a hoax.

Wiesel published two volumes of memoirs. The first, &quot;All Rivers Run to the Sea&quot;, was published in 1994 and covered his life up to the year 1969. The second, titled &quot;And the Sea is Never Full&quot; and published in 1999, covered the years from 1969 to 1999.

==Political activism==
Wiesel and his wife, Marion, started the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity in 1986. He served as chairman of the President&#x27;s Commission on the Holocaust (later renamed the US Holocaust Memorial Council) from 1978 to 1986, spearheading the building of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. Sigmund Strochlitz was his close friend and confidant during these years.

The Holocaust Memorial Museum gives the Elie Wiesel Award to &quot;internationally prominent individuals whose actions have advanced the Museum&#x27;s vision of a world where people confront hatred, prevent genocide, and promote human dignity&quot;. The Foundation had invested its endowment in money manager Bernard L. Madoff&#x27;s investment Ponzi scheme, costing the Foundation $15 million and Wiesel and his wife much of their own personal savings.

===Support for Israeli government policy===
In 1982, at the request of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Wiesel agreed to resign from his position as chairman of a planned international conference on the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide. Wiesel then worked with the Foreign Ministry in its attempts to get the conference either canceled or to remove all discussion of the Armenian genocide from it, and to those ends he provided the Foreign Ministry with internal documents on the conference&#x27;s planning and lobbied fellow academics to not attend the conference.

During his lifetime, Wiesel had deflected questions on the topic of the Israeli settlements, claiming to abstain from commenting on Israel&#x27;s internal debates. According to Hussein Ibish, despite this position, Wiesel had gone on record as supporting the idea of expanding Jewish settlements into the Palestinian territories conquered by Israel during the 6 Day War; such settlements are considered illegal by the international community.

=== Awards and other activism===
Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986 for speaking out against violence, repression, and racism. The Norwegian Nobel Committee described Wiesel as &quot;one of the most important spiritual leaders and guides in an age when violence, repression, and racism continue to characterize the world&quot; and called him a &quot;messenger to mankind&quot;. It also stressed that Wiesel&#x27;s commitment originated in the sufferings of the Jewish people but that he expanded it to embrace all repressed peoples and races.

In his acceptance speech he delivered a message &quot;of peace, atonement, and human dignity&quot;. He explained his feelings: &quot;Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere. When human lives are endangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant.&quot;

He received many other prizes and honors for his work, including the Congressional Gold Medal in 1985, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and The International Center in New York&#x27;s Award of Excellence. 
He was also elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1996.

Wiesel co-founded &quot;Moment&quot; magazine with Leonard Fein in 1975. They founded the magazine to provide a voice for American Jews. He was also a member of the International Advisory Board of NGO Monitor.

A staunch opponent of the death penalty, Wiesel stated that he thought that even Adolf Eichmann should not have been executed.

Wiesel, a supporter of immigrant&#x27;s rights, popularized the slogan &quot;No human being is illegal&quot;. stating &quot;you who are so-called illegal aliens should know that no human being is illegal. That is a contradiction in terms Human beings can be beautiful or more beautiful, they can be fat or skinny, they can be right or wrong, but illegal? How can a human being be illegal?&quot;

In April 1999, Wiesel delivered the speech &quot;The Perils of Indifference&quot; in Washington D.C., criticizing the people and countries who chose to be indifferent while the Holocaust was happening. He defined indifference as being neutral between two sides, which, in this case, amounts to overlooking the victims of the Holocaust. Throughout the speech, he expressed the view that a little bit of attention, either positive or negative, is better than no attention at all.

In 2003, he discovered and publicized the fact that at least 280,000 Romanian and Ukrainian Jews, along with other groups, were massacred in Romanian-run death camps.

In 2005, he gave a speech at the opening ceremony of the new building of Yad Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust History Museum:
I know what people say – it is so easy. Those that were there won&#x27;t agree with that statement. The statement is: it was man&#x27;s inhumanity to man. NO! It was man&#x27;s inhumanity to Jews! Jews were not killed because they were human beings. In the eyes of the killers they were not human beings! They were Jews!

In early 2006, Wiesel accompanied Oprah Winfrey as she visited Auschwitz, a visit which was broadcast as part of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. The trip was organized by International March of the Living&#x27;s Vice Chair, &quot;David Machlis.&quot; On November 30, 2006, Wiesel received a knighthood in London in recognition of his work toward raising Holocaust education in the United Kingdom.

In September 2006, he appeared before the UN Security Council with actor George Clooney to call attention to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. When Wiesel died, Clooney wrote, &quot;We had a champion who carried our pain, our guilt, and our responsibility on his shoulders for generations.&quot;

In 2007, Wiesel was awarded the Dayton Literary Peace Prize&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award. That same year, the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity issued a letter condemning Armenian genocide denial, a letter that was signed by 53 Nobel laureates including Wiesel. Wiesel repeatedly called Turkey&#x27;s 90-year-old campaign to downplay its actions during the Armenian genocide a double killing.

In 2009, Wiesel criticized the Vatican for lifting the excommunication of controversial bishop Richard Williamson, a member of the Society of Saint Pius X. The excommunication was later reimposed.

In June 2009, Wiesel accompanied US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel as they toured the Buchenwald concentration camp. Wiesel was an adviser at the Gatestone Institute. In 2010, Wiesel accepted a five-year appointment as a Distinguished Presidential Fellow at Chapman University in Orange County, California. In that role, he made a one-week visit to Chapman annually to meet with students and offer his perspective on subjects ranging from Holocaust history to religion, languages, literature, law and music.

In July 2009, Wiesel announced his support to the minority Tamils in Sri Lanka. He said that, &quot;Wherever minorities are being persecuted, we must raise our voices to protest ... The Tamil people are being disenfranchised and victimized by the Sri Lanka authorities. This injustice must stop. The Tamil people must be allowed to live in peace and flourish in their homeland.&quot;

In 2009, Wiesel returned to Hungary for his first visit since the Holocaust. During this visit, Wiesel participated in a conference at the Upper House Chamber of the Hungarian Parliament, met Prime Minister Gordon Bajnai and President László Sólyom, and made a speech to the approximately 10,000 participants of an anti-racist gathering held in Faith Hall. However, in 2012, he protested against &quot;the whitewashing&quot; of Hungary&#x27;s involvement in the Holocaust, and he gave up the Great Cross award he had received from the Hungarian government.

Wiesel was active in trying to prevent Iran from making nuclear weapons, stating that, &quot;The words and actions of the leadership of Iran leave no doubt as to their intentions&quot;. He also condemned Hamas for the &quot;use of children as human shields&quot; during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict by running an ad in several large newspapers. &quot;The Times&quot; refused to run the advertisement, saying, &quot;The opinion being expressed is too strong, and too forcefully made, and will cause concern amongst a significant number of &quot;Times&quot; readers.&quot;

Wiesel often emphasized the Jewish connection to Jerusalem, and criticized the Obama administration for pressuring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt East Jerusalem Israeli settlement construction. He stated that &quot;Jerusalem is above politics. It is mentioned more than six hundred times in Scripture—and not a single time in the Koran ... It belongs to the Jewish people and is much more than a city&quot;.

==Teaching==
Wiesel held the position of Andrew Mellon Professor of the Humanities at Boston University from 1976, teaching in both its religion and philosophy departments. He became a close friend of the president and chancellor John Silber. The university created the Elie Wiesel Center for Jewish Studies in his honor. From 1972 to 1976 Wiesel was a Distinguished Professor at the City University of New York and member of the American Federation of Teachers.

In 1982 he served as the first Henry Luce Visiting Scholar in Humanities and Social Thought at Yale University. He also co-instructed Winter Term (January) courses at Eckerd College, St. Petersburg, Florida. From 1997 to 1999 he was Ingeborg Rennert Visiting professor of Judaic Studies at Barnard College of Columbia University.

==Personal life==

In 1969 he married Marion Erster Rose, who originally was from Austria and also translated many of his books. They had one son, Shlomo Elisha Wiesel, named after Wiesel&#x27;s father. The family lived in Greenwich, Connecticut.

Wiesel was attacked in a San Francisco hotel by 22-year-old Holocaust denier Eric Hunt in February 2007, but was not injured. Hunt was arrested the following month and charged with multiple offenses.

In May 2011, Wiesel served as the Washington University in St. Louis commencement speaker.

In February 2012, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints performed a posthumous baptism for Simon Wiesenthal&#x27;s parents without proper authorization. After his own name was submitted for proxy baptism, Wiesel spoke out against the unauthorized practice of posthumously baptizing Jews and asked presidential candidate and Latter-day Saint Mitt Romney to denounce it. Romney&#x27;s campaign declined to comment, directing such questions to church officials.

==Death and aftermath==
Wiesel died on the morning of July 2, 2016, at his home in Manhattan, aged 87. After a private funeral service was conducted in honor of him at the Fifth Avenue Synagogue, he was buried at the Sharon Gardens Cemetery in Valhalla, New York, on July 3.

Utah senator Orrin Hatch paid tribute to Wiesel in a speech on the Senate floor the following week, in which he said that &quot;With Elie&#x27;s passing, we have lost a beacon of humanity and hope. We have lost a hero of human rights and a luminary of Holocaust literature.&quot;

In 2018, antisemitic graffiti was found on the house where Wiesel was born.

Marion Wiesel died on February 2, 2025, at the age of 94.

<doc id="10520" wikidata="Q221843" url="?curid=10520" title="Ed Wood">
<text>Edward Davis Wood Jr. (October 10, 1924 – December 10, 1978) was an American filmmaker, actor, and pulp novelist.

In the 1950s, Wood directed several low-budget science fiction, crime and horror films that later became cult classics, notably &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot; (1953), &quot;Jail Bait&quot; (1954), &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot; (1955), &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot; (1957) and &quot;Night of the Ghouls&quot; (1959). In the 1960s and 1970s, he moved towards sexploitation and pornographic films such as &quot;The Sinister Urge&quot; (1960), &quot;Orgy of the Dead&quot; (1965) and &quot;Necromania&quot; (1971), and wrote over 80 lurid pulp crime and sex novels.

Notable for their campy aesthetics, technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, use of poorly-matched stock footage, eccentric casts, idiosyncratic stories and non sequitur dialogue, Wood&#x27;s films remained largely obscure until he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Director of All Time in 1980, renewing public interest in his life and work.

Following the publication of Rudolph Grey&#x27;s 1992 oral biography &quot;Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr.&quot;, a biopic of his life, &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (1994), was directed by Tim Burton. Starring Johnny Depp as Wood and Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, the film received critical acclaim and various awards, including two Academy Awards.

==Early years==
Wood&#x27;s father worked for the United States Post Office as a custodian, and his family relocated numerous times around the United States. Eventually, they settled in Poughkeepsie, New York, where Wood was born in 1924. According to his second wife, Kathy O&#x27;Hara, Wood&#x27;s mother Lillian would dress him in girl&#x27;s clothing when he was a child because she had always wanted a daughter (Wood had one brother, several years younger than himself). For the rest of his life, Wood crossdressed, infatuated with the feel of angora on his skin.

During his childhood, Wood was interested in the performing arts and pulp fiction. He collected comic books and pulp magazines, and adored movies, especially Westerns, serials, and the occult. Buck Jones and Bela Lugosi were two of his earliest childhood idols. He often skipped school in order to watch motion pictures at the local movie theater, where stills from last week&#x27;s films would often be thrown into the trash by theater staff, allowing Wood to salvage the images, and to add to his extensive collection.

On his 12th birthday, in 1936, Wood received as a gift his first movie camera, a Kodak &quot;Cine Special&quot;. One of his first pieces of footage showed the airship &quot;Hindenburg&quot; passing over the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie, shortly before its disastrous crash at Lakehurst, New Jersey. One of Wood&#x27;s first paid jobs was as a cinema usher, and he also sang and played drums in a band. Subsequently, he formed a quartet called &quot;Eddie Wood&#x27;s Little Splinters&quot; in which he sang and played multiple stringed instruments.

===Military service===
In 1942, Wood enlisted at age 17 in the United States Marine Corps, just months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Assigned to the 2nd Defense Battalion, he reached the rank of corporal before he was discharged in 1946 at age 21. Although Wood reportedly claimed to have faced strenuous combat, including having his front teeth knocked out by a Japanese soldier, his military records reveal that to be false, apart from recovering bodies on Betio following the Battle of Tarawa, and experiencing minor Japanese bombing raids on Betio and the Ellice Islands. A recurring filariasis infection left him performing clerical work for the remainder of his enlistment. His dental extractions were carried out over several months by Navy dentists, unconnected to any combat. Wood had false teeth that he would slip out from his mouth when he wanted to make his wife Kathy laugh, showing her a big toothless grin. Wood later claimed that he feared being wounded in battle more than he feared being killed, mainly because he was afraid a combat medic would discover him wearing a pink bra and panties under his uniform during the Battle of Tarawa.

==Career==
===Directing and screenwriting===
In 1947, Wood moved to Hollywood, California, where he wrote scripts and directed television pilots, commercials and several forgotten micro-budget westerns, most of which failed to sell. Wood biographer Rudolph Grey states that Ed Wood made approximately 125 commercials for Story-Ad films and approximately 30 commercials for Play-Ad Films, in addition to a few commercials for &quot;Pie-Quick&quot;.

In 1948, Wood wrote, produced, directed, and starred in &quot;The Casual Company&quot;, a play derived from his own unpublished novel which was based on his service in the United States Marine Corps. It opened at the Village Playhouse to negative reviews on October 25. That same year, he wrote and directed a low-budget western called &quot;Crossroads of Laredo&quot; with the aid of a young producer he met named Crawford John Thomas. The film was shot silent and was not completed during Wood&#x27;s lifetime.

In 1949, Wood and Thomas acted together in a play called &quot;The Blackguard Returns&quot; at the Gateway Theatre (Wood played the Sheriff and Thomas was the villain). Wood joined the Screen Actors Guild in 1951, and worked very briefly as a stuntman among other things. When writing, Wood used a number of different pen names, including Ann Gora (in reference to Angora, his favorite textile) and Akdov Telmig (the backwards spelling of his favorite drink, the vodka gimlet).

In 1952, Wood was introduced to actor Bela Lugosi by friend and fellow writer-producer Alex Gordon (Wood&#x27;s roommate at the time who was later involved in creating American International Pictures). Lugosi&#x27;s son, Bela George Lugosi Jr., has been among those who felt Wood exploited the senior Lugosi&#x27;s stardom, taking advantage of the fading actor when he could not afford to refuse any work. However, most documents and interviews with other Wood associates in &quot;Nightmare of Ecstasy&quot; suggest that Wood and Lugosi were genuine friends and that Wood helped Lugosi through the worst days of his clinical depression and drug addiction. Lugosi had become dependent on morphine as a way of controlling his debilitating sciatica over the years, and was in a poor mental state caused by his recent divorce.

====&quot;Glen or Glenda&quot;====
In 1953, Wood wrote and directed the semi-documentary film &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot; (originally titled &quot;I Changed My Sex!&quot;) with producer George Weiss. The film starred Wood (under the alias &quot;Daniel Davis&quot;) as a transvestite, his girlfriend Dolores Fuller, Timothy Farrell, Lyle Talbot, Conrad Brooks and Bela Lugosi as the narrator/scientist. Fuller was shocked when she learned soon afterward that Wood actually was a cross-dresser.

In 1953, Wood wrote and directed a stage show for Lugosi called &quot;The Bela Lugosi Review&quot; (a take-off on &quot;Dracula&quot;) that was put on at the Silver Slipper in Las Vegas. When Lugosi appeared on the TV show &quot;You Asked For It&quot; that same year, he announced that Ed Wood was producing a &quot;Dr. Acula&quot; TV show for him, but it never materialized. Wood acted as Lugosi&#x27;s dialogue coach when he guest-starred on &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; in 1954, alongside Lon Chaney Jr. and Vampira (aka Maila Nurmi).

====&quot;Jail Bait&quot;====
Wood co-produced and directed a crime film, &quot;Jail Bait&quot; (1954, originally titled &quot;The Hidden Face&quot;), along with his co-writer/roommate Alex Gordon, which starred Herbert Rawlinson (as the plastic surgeon), Lyle Talbot, Dolores Fuller, Timothy Farrell, Theodora Thurman and Steve Reeves (in one of his first acting jobs). Bela Lugosi was supposed to play the lead role of the plastic surgeon, but was busy with another project when filming started and had to bow out. His replacement, Herbert Rawlinson, died the day after he filmed his scenes. Distributor Ron Ormond changed the title from &quot;The Hidden Face&quot; to &quot;Jail Bait&quot; just before releasing it.

====&quot;Bride of the Monster&quot;====
Wood produced and directed the horror film &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot; (1955, originally titled &quot;Bride of the Atom&quot; or &quot;The Monster of the Marshes&quot;), based on an original story idea by Alex Gordon which he had originally called &quot;The Atomic Monster&quot;. It starred Bela Lugosi as the mad scientist, Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson as mute manservant &quot;Lobo&quot;, Paul Marco, Billy Benedict (&quot;Whitey&quot; of &quot;The Bowery Boys&quot;), Harvey B. Dunn and Loretta King. Soon after the film was completed, Bela Lugosi committed himself to the Norwalk State Hospital for three months, to be treated for drug addiction. The film premiered on May 11, 1955, at the Paramount theater in Hollywood while Lugosi was institutionalized, but a special screening was arranged for him upon his release, pleasing him greatly.

====&quot;The Violent Years&quot;====

In 1956, Wood wrote the screenplay (uncredited) for the film &quot;The Violent Years&quot; (originally titled &quot;Teenage Girl Gang&quot;), which was directed by William M. Morgan, starring &quot;Playboy&quot; model Jean Moorhead, Timothy Farrell, and serial star I. Stanford Jolley (as a judge).

Wood began filming a juvenile delinquency film called &quot;Rock and Roll Hell&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Hellborn&quot;) in 1956, but producer George Weiss pulled the plug on the project after only ten minutes of footage had been completed. Wood&#x27;s friend Conrad Brooks purchased the footage from Weiss, and some scenes were later incorporated as stock footage into Wood&#x27;s later &quot;Night of the Ghouls&quot; (1959). (The entire ten minutes of footage was later released complete on VHS in 1993, as &quot;Hellborn&quot;.)

====&quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;====

In late 1956, Wood co-produced, wrote, and directed his science fiction opus &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot; (his screenplay was originally titled &quot;Grave Robbers from Outer Space&quot;), which featured Bela Lugosi in a small role. (Although Lugosi died in August 1956 before production began, Wood used footage he had shot of Lugosi in 1955–1956.) The film also starred Tor Johnson, Vampira (Maila Nurmi), Tom Mason (who doubled for Lugosi in some scenes), and the Amazing Criswell as the film&#x27;s narrator. &quot;Plan 9&quot; premiered on March 15, 1957, at the Carlton Theatre in Hollywood, and later went into general release in July 1958 (retitled &quot;Plan Nine from Outer Space&quot;) in Texas and a number of other Southern states. It was finally sold to late night television in 1961, thereby finding its audience over the years. It became Wood&#x27;s best-known film and found a cult following in 1980 when Michael Medved declared this film &quot;the worst film ever made&quot; in his book &quot;The Golden Turkey Awards&quot;.

====&quot;Final Curtain&quot;====
In 1957, Wood wrote and directed a pilot for a suspense-horror TV series called &quot;Portraits in Terror&quot; that ultimately failed to sell. The pilot, entitled &quot;Final Curtain&quot;, sees an old and world-weary actor wandering in an empty theatre, imagining ghosts and a living mannequin haunting the backstage area, until he realizes that he himself is dead. The episode has no dialogue, and Dudley Manlove narrates the thoughts of Duke Moore as the actor. Lugosi would have starred in this short film had he lived. Parts of the unsold pilot were later recycled for use in Wood&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Ghouls&quot; (1959). The episode was thought to be lost until a complete print was located . It was remastered and given its first ever cinema showing in a theater in February 2012. Today it is widely available online and on DVD.

====&quot;Night of the Ghouls&quot;====
In 1958, Wood wrote, produced, and directed &quot;Night of the Ghouls&quot; (originally titled &quot;Revenge of the Dead&quot;), starring Kenne Duncan, Tor Johnson (reprising his role as &quot;Lobo&quot; from &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot;), Criswell, Duke Moore, and Valda Hansen. The film premiered at the Vista Theatre in Hollywood on a double bill with the Lana Turner movie &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; on March 17, 1959, and then promptly vanished from circulation. For many years, it was thought to be a lost film, but distribution of the film was held up for 25 years because Wood had not paid the lab bill. Video producer Wade Williams paid the bill and released the film on videocassette in 1984, copyrighting the film in his own name.

In 1958, Wood also wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Bride and the Beast&quot; (1958), which was directed by Adrian Weiss. Wood&#x27;s screenplay was based on Weiss&#x27; plot.

Wood also wrote the screenplay (as &quot;Peter LaRoche&quot;) for a 1959 &quot;nudie cutie&quot; film called &quot;Revenge of the Virgins&quot;, which was directed by Peter Perry Jr.

====&quot;The Sinister Urge&quot;====
Wood wrote and directed the exploitation film &quot;The Sinister Urge&quot; (1960), starring Kenne Duncan, Duke Moore, Dino Fantini, Harvey B. Dunn and Carl Anthony. Filmed in just five days, this is the last mainstream film Wood directed, although it has exploitation elements. The film contains an &quot;eerily prescient&quot; scene, in which Carl Anthony&#x27;s character states, &quot;I look at this slush, and I try to remember, at one time, I made good movies&quot;. The scenes of the teenagers at the pizzeria had been previously shot in 1956 for Wood&#x27;s unfinished juvenile delinquency film, &quot;Rock and Roll Hell&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Hellborn&quot;).

Also in 1960, Wood wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Peeper&quot;, which he intended as a direct sequel to his 1960 film &quot;The Sinister Urge&quot;, but it was never produced.

Wood also contributed to the plot of Jane Mann&#x27;s 1961 screenplay &quot;Anatomy of a Psycho&quot;. The film was directed by Mann&#x27;s husband Boris Petroff.

In 1963, Wood wrote the screenplay for &quot;Shotgun Wedding&quot; (an exploitation film directed by Boris Petroff about hillbillies marrying child brides in the Ozarks). Wood wrote the screenplay from a story idea by Jane Mann. Wood&#x27;s friend, cameraman William C. Thompson, died around this time.

====&quot;Orgy of the Dead&quot;====
Wood&#x27;s 1965 transitional film &quot;Orgy of the Dead&quot; (originally titled &quot;Nudie Ghoulies&quot;) combined the horror and sexploitation genres. Wood handled various production details while Stephen C. Apostolof directed under the pseudonym A. C. Stephen. The film begins with a recreation of the opening scene from &quot;Night of the Ghouls&quot;. Criswell, wearing one of Lugosi&#x27;s old capes, rises from his coffin to deliver an introduction taken almost word-for-word from the previous film. Set in a misty graveyard, the Lord of the Dead (Criswell) and his sexy consort, the Black Ghoul (a Vampira look-alike), preside over a series of macabre performances by topless dancers from beyond the grave (recruited by Wood from local strip clubs). Together, Wood and Apostolof went on to make a string of sexploitation films up to 1977. Wood co-wrote the screenplays with Apostolof and occasionally even acted in some of the films.

In 1969, Wood appeared in &quot;The Photographer&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Love Feast&quot; or &quot;Pretty Models All in a Row&quot;), the first of two films produced by a Marine buddy, Joseph F. Robertson, with Wood portraying a photographer using his position to engage in sexual antics with his models.

Wood had a smaller role in Robertson&#x27;s second film, &quot;Mrs. Stone&#x27;s Thing&quot; (1970), as a transvestite who spends his time at a party trying on lingerie in a bedroom.

In 1969, Wood adapted his own novel &quot;Mama&#x27;s Diary&quot; written under the pseudonym Dick Trent into &quot;Operation Red Light&quot; for Jacques Descent Production. Over half the footage was destroyed in a film-processing accident and the film is considered lost.

&quot;Venus Flytrap&quot; (1970) aka &quot;The Revenge of Dr. X&quot;, a US/Japanese co-production, was based on an unproduced Ed Wood screenplay from the 1950s. The film was produced and directed by Sci-Fi pulp writer Norman Earl Thomson. The film involves a mad scientist who uses lightning to transform plants into man-eating monsters. Wood did not participate in the actual making of the movie.

====&quot;Take It Out in Trade&quot;====
In 1970, Wood wrote and directed his own pornographic film, &quot;Take It Out in Trade&quot;, starring Duke Moore and Nona Carver. Wood played a transvestite named Alecia in the film.

In 1970, Wood produced a 45 rpm record which featured Tor Johnson on one side, reading &quot;The Day The Mummy Returned&quot;, and Criswell reading &quot;The Final Curtain&quot; on the other. It has never been determined whether or not the record was actually released, but many of them were definitely produced.

====&quot;Necromania&quot;====
In 1971, Wood produced, wrote and directed &quot;Necromania&quot; (subtitled &quot;A Tale of Weird Love&quot;) under the pseudonym &quot;Don Miller&quot;. The film was an early entry to the new subgenre of hardcore pornographic films. Thought lost for years, it resurfaced in edited form on Mike Vraney&#x27;s Something Weird imprint in the late 1980s and was re-released later on DVD by Fleshbot Films in 2005. In the Rudolph Grey biography &quot;Nightmare of Ecstasy&quot;, Maila Nurmi (&quot;Vampira&quot;) said she declined Wood&#x27;s offer to do a nude scene sitting in a coffin for &quot;Necromania&quot;, claiming she was recovering from a stroke at the time.

From 1971 to 1972, Wood directed an unknown number of short X-rated films produced by the Swedish Erotica film company. These were short 12-minute loops that were silent films with subtitles. Wood was paid $100 for every ten loops he subtitled.

Wood&#x27;s friends Kenne Duncan and Tor Johnson both passed away during this period. (Wood was named executor of Kenne Duncan&#x27;s estate, and following Duncan&#x27;s death, Wood held a small memorial funeral for him with his wife and some friends in his backyard around the swimming pool where they eulogized the departed Western film star.) Wood&#x27;s friend Duke Moore died in 1976.
Throughout the 1970s, Wood worked with his friend Stephen C. Apostolof, usually co-writing scripts with him, but also serving as an assistant director and an associate producer. (Together they had made Wood&#x27;s &quot;Orgy of the Dead&quot; back in 1965.) Wood&#x27;s last known on-screen appearance (a dual role) was in Apostolof&#x27;s 1974 film &quot;Fugitive Girls&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Five Loose Women&quot;), in which he played both a gas station attendant called &quot;Pops&quot; and a sheriff on the fugitive women&#x27;s trail. In 1974, Wood was allegedly on the set of an ultra-low budget film called &quot;Meatcleaver Massacre&quot; (1977) and is said to have co-directed at least one scene in the film (uncredited), but his involvement is dubious.

At the time of his death, Wood was working on a biographical screenplay based on the last years of actor Bela Lugosi to be called &quot;Lugosi Post Mortem&quot;, which was supposed to star actor Peter Coe as Lugosi and Karl Johnson as his father Tor Johnson. The nearly completed script was left behind the last time Wood was evicted and is presumed to have been discarded in the trash. Wood was also working on a screenplay for a film called &quot;Venus De Milo&quot;, a mystery that would explain the famous statue&#x27;s missing arms.

Technically, Wood&#x27;s last acting job was in the 1978 Stephen Apostolof film &quot;Hot Ice&quot;. Ed Wood played a janitor in the film, but his scene was cut out at the last minute due to his drunkenness on the set. Wood died soon after this film was made in 1978, at age 54. Apostolof himself stopped making films as well at this time.

===Books and novels===

Beginning in 1963 up until his death, Wood wrote at least 80 lurid crime and sex novels in addition to hundreds of short stories and non-fiction pieces for magazines and daily newspapers.

His novels include &quot;Black Lace Drag&quot; (1963) (reissued in 1965 as &quot;Killer in Drag&quot;), &quot;Orgy of the Dead&quot; (1965), &quot;Parisian Passions&quot; (1966), &quot;Watts the Difference&quot; (1966), &quot;Side-Show Siren&quot; (1966), &quot;Drag Trade&quot; (1967), &quot;Watts After&quot; (1967), &quot;Devil Girls&quot; (1967), &quot;It Takes One to Know One&quot; (1967), &quot;Death of a Transvestite&quot; (1967), &quot;Suburbia Confidential&quot; (1967), &quot;Night Time Lez&quot; (1968), &quot;The Perverts&quot; (1968), &quot;Bye Bye Broadie&quot; (1968), &quot;Raped in the Grass&quot; (1968), &quot;Sex, Shrouds and Caskets&quot; (1968), &quot;Love of the Dead&quot; (1968), &quot;The Sexecutives&quot; (1968), &quot;Young, Black and Gay&quot; (1968), &quot;Hell Chicks&quot; (1968), &quot;The Gay Underworld&quot; (1968), &quot;Carnival Piece&quot; (1969), &quot;Toni, Black Tigress&quot; (1969), &quot;Mama&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1969), &quot;To Make a Homo&quot; (1969), &quot;Mary-Go-Round&quot; (1969), &quot;The Sexual Woman&quot; (1971), &quot;The Only House&quot; (1972), &quot;A Study of Fetishes and Fantasies&quot; (1973), &quot;Tales for a Sexy Night Part 1 and 2&quot; (1973), &quot;Sex Star&quot; (1973), &quot;Death of a Transvestite Hooker&quot; (1974). &quot;Forced Entry&quot; (1974), and &quot;TV Lust&quot; (1977).

In 1965, Wood wrote the quasi-memoir &quot;Hollywood Rat Race&quot;, which was only published years later in 1998. In it, Wood advises new writers to &quot;just keep on writing. Even if your story gets worse, you&#x27;ll get better&quot;, and also recounts tales of dubious authenticity, such as how he and Bela Lugosi entered the world of nightclub cabaret.

Thirty-two short stories known to be written by Wood (he sometimes wrote under pseudonyms such as &quot;Ann Gora&quot; and &quot;Dr. T.K. Peters&quot;) are collected in an anthology &quot;Blood Splatters Quickly&quot;, published by OR Books in 2014.

===Unrealized projects===
* Dr. Acula – Wood was supposed to write and direct this proposed 1953 TV series in which Bela Lugosi was supposed to play a mysterious investigator of the supernatural, to be produced by Ted Allan. (Lugosi mentioned it when he appeared that year on &quot;You Asked for It&quot;.)
* &quot;Sequel to &quot;Mother Riley Meets the Vampire – Lugosi was offered the lead role in a proposed 1953 sequel to the Mother Riley comedy film he made in England in 1951, provided he travel back to England to appear in it. This sequel was never made however as Lugosi was too ill at the time to travel. In 1953, Ed Wood&#x27;s friend producer Alex Gordon proposed creating an extended version of the 1951 film to be called &quot;King Robot&quot; which would incorporate newly filmed footage of Lugosi. The project was abandoned since by that time, Lugosi appeared too ill to match the earlier footage.
* The Six Arms of Siva – This was a 1953 adventure novel written by Walter C. Brown which Wood and Lugosi were considering buying the film rights to, but the deal fell through.
* 3-D Remake of &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931) – Ed Wood and teenage Lugosi fan Richard Sheffield petitioned Universal Studios in 1953 to make a Color/ 3-D remake of the 1931 classic &quot;Dracula&quot;, starring Lugosi in the lead. Although they gathered hundreds of signatures, nothing came of their efforts.
* The Vampire&#x27;s Tomb – This was a planned July, 1954 horror film starring Bela Lugosi as the &quot;Dr. Acula&quot; character again. The cast would also have included Loretta King, Bobby Jordan (of &quot;The Bowery Boys&quot;), Dolores Fuller, Lyle Talbot, Duke Moore, Tom Keene and a Vampira-lookalike named &quot;Devila&quot;. Wood&#x27;s plot was very similar to that of Tod Browning&#x27;s &quot;London After Midnight&quot;, only with a female vampire. Wood shelved this project and filmed &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot; instead. Wood however did film some test footage of Lugosi wearing his Dracula cape in a local graveyard for this project which became part of the stock footage which was later incorporated into Wood&#x27;s 1957 &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot; film.
* The Bowery Boys Meet The Monsters – Lugosi was initially considered for the role of the mad scientist in this 1954 horror-comedy, but he was replaced in the cast by John Dehner at the last minute.
* Bela Lugosi Comics – In March 1954, Wood tried to interest a number of comic book publishers in a monthly Bela Lugosi title, to no avail. Among the companies he contacted were DC Comics, Dell, Fiction House, Ziff-Davis, Quality and Toby Press.
* Doctor Voodoo (a.k.a. &quot;Voodoo Doctor&quot;) – A projected 1954 horror film (similar in plot to the 1934 Universal film &quot;The Black Cat&quot;) that was supposed to have starred both Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff, but Allied Artists rejected the script. It is said Karloff really wanted no part of the project anyway.
* The Terror Radio Program – Wood wrote a list of story ideas for this proposed 1954 15-minute radio program which was supposed to star Bela Lugosi, but it never materialized.
* The Ghoul Goes West (or &quot;The Phantom Ghoul&quot;) – Wood worked on this script for two years, and had planned to produce it in Color/ Widescreen (and possibly 3-D). It was a proposed 1955 Western/Horror film that would have starred Gene Autry, Bela Lugosi, Tor Johnson, Lon Chaney Jr. and John Carradine, with Harold Daniels slated to direct. The plot was very similar to that of &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot;, only in a Western setting. Gene Autry dropped out, and Wood tried to replace him with either Bob Steele or Ken Maynard, to no avail. Lugosi was reading the script the whole time he was confined to the Norwalk State Hospital in 1955, where he was being treated for drug addiction. Coincidentally, Lugosi, Chaney, Tor Johnson and Carradine all appeared together the following year in &quot;The Black Sleep&quot; (a project that did not involve Ed Wood).
* Repeat Performance – This was a 1956 movie script that was written by Richard Sheffield, a Hollywood teenager who was a close personal friend of Bela Lugosi. He sold the script to Ed Wood for $1.00, but the film was never made since Wood was unable to interest financiers. The plot involved a &quot;poor, retired actor of horror films&quot; who is cast aside and rejected by the four film producers he once worked for, and he winds up murdering all four of them &quot;in a gruesome manner similar to the way he was killed in many of his horror films&quot;. This may have been Wood&#x27;s inspiration for his 1958 proposal to Sam Arkoff, which Wood claimed was stolen from him and later became AIP&#x27;s &quot;How To Make A Monster&quot;. (see below under 1958).
* Rock and Rock Hell (or &quot;Hellborn&quot;) – Wood&#x27;s version of &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, it was supposed to have starred Conrad Brooks, Duke Moore, Tom Mason and Wood himself, to be produced by George Weiss. It began shooting in June 1956, but Weiss decided to abandon the project and sold the ten minutes of footage they shot to Conrad Brooks. Footage from this film was later incorporated into Wood&#x27;s 1959 &quot;Night of the Ghouls&quot;.
* The Dead Never Die – Criswell and Paul Marco came up with the story for this 1957 project, which Wood was slated to direct. It would&#x27;ve starred Criswell, Paul Marco, Bunny Breckinridge and Vampira (&quot;Maila Nurmi&quot;), but it never got off the ground.
* How To Make a Monster – Wood&#x27;s widow Kathy claimed in a 1992 interview that her husband always felt that the idea for &quot;How to Make a Monster (1958 film)&quot; was stolen from him by AIP producer Sam Arkoff. She said, &quot;Eddie condemned Arkoff, he really hated him. Eddie gave (AIP) a script for approval, and they changed the characters a little bit around. Eddie had written it for Lugosi (circa 1956). It was about this old horror actor who couldn&#x27;t get work anymore, so he took his vengeance out on the studio. They changed it to a make-up man who takes revenge on a studio.&quot; Arkoff always denied Wood&#x27;s claim was true, stating Herman Cohen originated the entire project.
* Ghouls of the Moon – Another attempt to build a horror film around a reel of unused silent footage that had been taken of Lugosi before he died in 1956, but nothing came of it since by 1958, Wood discovered the film in the can had degraded into an unusable sludge due to bad storage conditions.
* Masquerade into Eternity – A 1959 Cold War political drama that Wood was supposed to write and direct, about a troupe of actors who get stranded in post-Revolution Cuba; it was to be produced by Ben Frommer, who was slated to play a Communist Colonel, but the project fell through.
* The Peeper (1960) Wood wrote the screenplay for The Peeper, intending it to be a direct sequel to his 1960 film &quot;The Sinister Urge (film)&quot;, but it was never produced.
* House of Horrors – Kenne Duncan and Tor Johnson were supposed to star in this 1960 film, which never materialized. Kenne Duncan was to play a mad artist who paints pictures of kidnapped women he confines in a dungeon, while Tor played a Lobo-like henchman.
* Portraits in Terror – A 1960 made-for-TV trilogy consisting of three episodes; it was to include &quot;The Final Curtain&quot;, &quot;The Night the Banshee Cried&quot; and &quot;Into My Grave&quot; (all written and directed by Wood), but the project fell through.
* Attack of the Giant Salami – A proposed 1964 horror film spoof that would&#x27;ve starred Boris Karloff, Joe E. Brown and Valda Hansen. Wood was inspired by the 1963 Brown/Karloff collaboration &quot;The Comedy of Terrors&quot;. The film was never made, probably due to Karloff&#x27;s disinterest.
* Tangier – A 1966 proposed action-adventure TV series that was supposed to be produced by Wood&#x27;s friend Stephen Apostoloff. Wood wrote a sample screenplay for the series which was never produced.
* 69 Rue Pigalle – In 1966, Stephen Apostoloff was set to produce and direct a film called &quot;69 Rue Pigalle&quot;, based on Ed Wood&#x27;s novel &quot;Parisian Passions&quot;, but the financing never materialized. The plot was supposed to be about a transvestite who solves a series of murders in Paris, and Lon Chaney Jr. was supposed to have been in the cast.
* The Enchanted Isle – An unfilmed 1966 Ed Wood screenplay for a film that was supposed to feature Lon Chaney Jr., Dana Andrews and John Ireland, about a Mafia princess stranded on a South Sea island and a mystery involving black pearls. (Wood originally wrote the screenplay back in 1954 and had tried at that time to interest producer Ron Ormond in the project, unsuccessfully.)
* Devil Girls – An unrealized 1967 Crime Drama about a drug-smuggling teenage girl gang who hang out at a seedy hamburger joint. Tor Johnson was to have played the brutish &quot;Chief&quot;, a goon who works for a retired race car driver named &quot;Jockey&quot;. It was based on Wood&#x27;s eponymous novel.
* The Life of Mickey Cohen – A 1967 proposed Crime Drama Wood was working on, in which Paul Marco was supposed to play the infamous gangster (a full decade after Marco appeared in &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot;). (At this point, Wood&#x27;s career became primarily focused on the pornographic industry.)
* The Day the Mummies Danced – A 1976 unproduced Ed Wood script that was supposed to be Wood&#x27;s long-awaited return to directing horror films; it was set to star John Agar (a long-time drinking buddy of Wood&#x27;s), Aldo Ray and Dudley Manlove (who was also supposed to produce the film). The filming was set to take place in Guanajuato, Mexico at the famous Mexican mummies exhibit there, but it never happened.

Wood&#x27;s list of unrealized film projects also included scripts called &quot;Piranhas&quot; (1957), &quot;Trial by Terror&quot; (1958), &quot;The Peeper&quot; (a proposed 1960 sequel to &quot;The Sinister Urge&quot;), &quot;Silent Night&quot; (1961), &quot;Joaquin Murieta&quot; (a 1965 biopic about the infamous bandit of the Old West), &quot;Mice on a Cold Cellar Floor&quot; (1973), &quot;Epitaph for the Town Drunk&quot; (1973), &quot;To Kill a Saturday Night&quot; (1973, which was set to star John Carradine), &quot;The Teachers&quot; (1973), &quot;The Basketballers&quot; (1973), &quot;The Airline Hostesses&quot; (1973), &quot;I Awoke Early the Day I Died&quot; (1974, a rewrite of Wood&#x27;s 1961 &quot;Silent Night&quot;), &quot;Heads, No Tails&quot; (1974, a take-off on Sweeney Todd), and &quot;Shoot Seven&quot; (1977, Wood&#x27;s proposed musical based on the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre).

==Personal life==

===Relationships and marriages===

Wood was in a long-term relationship with actress and songwriter Dolores Fuller, whom he met in late 1952. She was in the process of divorcing her first husband Donald Fuller, with whom she had had two sons. Wood and Fuller shared an apartment for three years, and Wood cast her in three of his films: &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot;, &quot;Jail Bait&quot; and, in a very brief cameo, in &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot;. Fuller later said she initially had no idea that Wood was a crossdresser and was mortified when she saw Wood dressed as a woman for the first time in &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot;. The couple broke up in 1955 after Wood cast another actress for the lead role in &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot; (Wood originally wrote the part for Fuller but later reduced her part to a brief cameo appearance) and because of Wood&#x27;s excessive drinking. Fuller relocated to New York City where she embarked on a successful songwriting career, writing for famous singers like Elvis Presley and Nat King Cole. Fuller died on May 9, 2011, at age 88.

In 1956, soon after his breakup with Fuller, Wood married actress Norma McCarty. McCarty appeared as Edie, the airplane stewardess, in &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;, and was recently divorced with two sons, Mike and John McCarty, from her earlier marriage. The marriage took Wood&#x27;s friends by surprise; one night, Wood called everyone to the sound stage for what they thought was a cast party, but when everyone was present, Wood brought out a huge wedding cake and a preacher, and announced he was getting married. The marriage ended approximately one month later after McCarty discovered that Wood was a crossdresser, and while it has been reported that their marriage was annulled, according to film archivist Wade Williams, they neither annulled the marriage nor legally divorced. McCarty died on June 27, 2014, at age 93.

Wood moved in with Paul Marco for a short while after McCarty left him. Later in 1956, Wood met Kathy O&#x27;Hara in a bar one night where he was drinking with Bela Lugosi. O&#x27;Hara fell in love with Wood immediately; they were married in Las Vegas a short while later, and Wood always considered O&#x27;Hara his legal wife despite the fact that his first marriage had not been legally annulled. Wood and O&#x27;Hara remained together until Wood&#x27;s death in December 1978. O&#x27;Hara never got along with his mother Lillian, calling her &quot;a strict disciplinarian&quot; who damaged Wood psychologically from early childhood. Wood occasionally sent money to his mom in the mail without O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s knowledge.

===Alleged daughter===

Wood was shocked to learn he had fathered a child out of wedlock after World War II with a young woman he had dated while he was in the Marines. According to Conrad Brooks, Wood and his wife Kathy only met the woman (also named Kathy) in 1967 when she was already 21 years old. Born on May 23, 1946, she had been living in Lancaster, California, and had managed to trace her father&#x27;s whereabouts. Wood&#x27;s mother Lillian said she had been contacted by the girl back in 1963 when she sent his mother a photo and introduced herself to Lillian as her granddaughter. Lillian said she sent the girl a watch for her graduation in 1964, but never heard back from her.

There is a photo of the young woman in Rudolph Grey&#x27;s biography on Wood.
She visited the Woods and stayed over at their house for a couple of days, but apparently the two women did not get along well. In fact, Wood&#x27;s wife physically threw her out of the house on the second day when she found her sleeping on their sofa.

Wood&#x27;s wife Kathy never believed that the girl was Wood&#x27;s daughter, saying in an interview, &quot;There was never any proof, only the woman&#x27;s statement on a birth certificate.&quot; Wood told Kathy that the woman he had sex with in 1946 used to sleep around regularly &quot;with 10 or 20 other Marines at the base&quot;, so he probably wasn&#x27;t the girl&#x27;s father. She said, &quot;She&#x27;s &quot;not&quot; your daughter, that bitch lied to you! The father could have been anyone. There&#x27;s only her accusation.&quot;

Actress Valda Hansen said, &quot;I met Ed&#x27;s daughter at his house in the Valley. She looked just like him. Beautiful, delicate. Green eyes, dark chocolate brown hair. She was very sweet.&quot; Art director Bob Derteno, who worked with Wood on &quot;Orgy of the Dead&quot;, said that Wood later travelled to attend his daughter&#x27;s wedding in New York and was later told that he had become a grandfather.

===Cross-dressing===

In Rudolph Grey&#x27;s 1992 biography &quot;Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr.&quot;, Wood&#x27;s wife Kathy O&#x27;Hara recalls that Wood told her that his mother dressed him in girls&#x27; clothing as a child. O&#x27;Hara stated that Wood&#x27;s cross-dressing was not a sexual inclination, but rather a neomaternal comfort derived mainly from angora fabric (angora is featured in many of Wood&#x27;s films). Even in his later years, Wood was not shy about going out in public dressed in drag as &quot;Shirley&quot;, his female alter ego (a name that appeared in many of his screenplays and stories). In his partly autobiographical film &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot;, the heterosexual Wood takes pains to emphasize that a male cross-dresser is not automatically also a homosexual. Wood directed many of his pornographic films in drag, but usually would not take the time to shave, which made for a bizarre sight, according to his friends. Wood always swore that he had never had a single homosexual relationship in his life, and was even considered quite a womanizer by many of his acquaintances. He once said that if he could have anything in life, it would be reincarnation as a blonde woman.

==Later years==
During the last 15 years of his life, Wood depended almost entirely on writing pornography novels to earn a living, receiving between $700 to $1,000 per novel which he spent almost immediately on alcohol at the local liquor store. Friends have stated how, in his final years, he eventually stopped bathing, and that his apartment became so filthy that he eventually would not allow friends to come over and visit because he knew they would be horrified to see how unkempt it had become. Paul Marco said Wood was constantly moaning, &quot;My God, I&#x27;ve given everything away. I should be a millionaire. I should have a million bucks right now!&quot;

Actor John Agar, an alcoholic himself, was drinking at Wood&#x27;s apartment one day in the late 1960s when the afternoon news program erroneously announced Agar&#x27;s obituary. Wood called the studio and told them that Agar was not dead. He told them &quot;He&#x27;s alive... he&#x27;s sitting right here with me now!&quot;. The story was corrected shortly thereafter.

Ed Wood and his wife were routinely evicted from their apartments for non-payment of rent. Each time they moved, Wood would immediately establish credit with the liquor store nearest his new address. Their last apartment was in a high-crime ghetto area &quot;at the corner of Yucca and Cahuenga&quot; in Hollywood inhabited by drug addicts, gamblers and prostitutes. Wood, who regularly pawned his typewriters for cash, was mugged regularly when he would stumble down the street to the liquor store. Eventually he had his publisher send his paychecks directly to the various liquor store owners so that he would not have to carry cash when he went there.

The Woods&#x27; apartment was always in danger of being burglarized. One night, a cross-dresser was beaten to death in the hallway just outside Wood&#x27;s apartment door and the sound of gunshots outside the building was a nightly occurrence.

According to friends, Wood and his wife often became violent when they drank. Stories abound of the two beating each other; Wood sometimes knocked Kathy unconscious. Criswell commented once, &quot;I always had the feeling that one would kill the other. And if you were there, the killer would say you did it!&quot; Nonetheless, years after Wood&#x27;s death, his wife always professed to love him dearly.

Bela Lugosi biographer Robert Cremer interviewed Wood once in his Yucca apartment for his 1976 book &quot;Lugosi: The Man Behind the Cape&quot; two years before Wood died. Cremer said Wood began the interview sober, but quickly became intoxicated over the next hour as the interview proceeded. Cremer said, &quot;He started getting really angry at me because he felt he was the person who should be writing (the book)... He went out in the kitchen, grabbed a bottle of Wild Turkey... He smashed the bottle on the kitchen counter and then came after me with it. He lunged at me, but he was so drunk, I just pushed him against the wall, and he collapsed. I just walked out the door and said &#x27;Okay Ed, I guess that was our last interview. I&#x27;ll see you.&#x27;&quot;

==Death==
By 1978, Wood&#x27;s depression had worsened as he and his wife Kathy O&#x27;Hara had both succumbed to alcoholism. They were evicted from their Hollywood apartment on Yucca Street on December 7, 1978, in total poverty by two sheriff&#x27;s deputies called by their landlord for failure to pay their overdue rent and had to leave behind all of his scrapbooks and unfinished screenplays, which the landlord allegedly threw into a garbage dumpster. Wood&#x27;s large film collection of his early commercials were also thrown out following his eviction. The couple moved into the small North Hollywood apartment of their friend, actor Peter Coe, located at 5635 Laurel Canyon Boulevard. Wood spent the weekend drinking vodka and desperately calling old friends for money, but to no avail.

Around noon on Sunday, December 10, Wood felt ill and went to lie down in Coe&#x27;s bedroom while Coe, O&#x27;Hara and a few friends were watching a football game on TV. From the bedroom, he asked O&#x27;Hara to bring him a drink, which she refused to do. A few minutes later, he yelled out, &quot;Kathy, I can&#x27;t breathe!&quot;, a plea O&#x27;Hara ignored as she later said she was tired of Wood bossing her around. After hearing no movement in the bedroom for twenty minutes, O&#x27;Hara sent a female friend to check on Wood, who discovered him dead on the bed from a heart attack. O&#x27;Hara later said, &quot;I still remember when I went into that room that afternoon and he was dead, his eyes and mouth were wide open. I&#x27;ll never forget the look in his eyes. He clutched at the sheets. It looked like he&#x27;d seen hell.&quot;

Wood was cremated at the Utter-McKinley mortuary, and his ashes were scattered at sea. Paul Marco, O&#x27;Hara, David DeMering and The Amazing Criswell attended Wood&#x27;s makeshift memorial service which was held at Peter Coe&#x27;s apartment following the cremation. Marco recalled how devastated O&#x27;Hara was at the time.

==Legacy and homages==

At the time of his death, Wood&#x27;s name and career had become so obscure that most local Los Angeles newspapers, including the entertainment magazine &quot;Variety&quot;, did not run an obituary about him.

The 1982 film &quot;It Came from Hollywood&quot; featured a &quot;Tribute to Ed Wood&quot; segment.

In 1986 in an essay paying homage to Wood in &quot;Incredibly Strange Films&quot;, Jim Morton wrote: &quot;Eccentric and individualistic, Edward D. Wood Jr. was a man born to film. [...] Lesser men, if forced to make movies under the conditions Wood faced, would have thrown up their hands in defeat&quot;.

In 1994, director Tim Burton released the biopic &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, starring Johnny Depp in the title role and Martin Landau, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi. It also won an Academy Award for Best Makeup for Rick Baker. Conrad Brooks appeared in the movie in a cameo role as &quot;Barman&quot;, along with Gregory Walcott in the role of a potential backer. The film premiered on September 30, 1994, just ten days before what would have been Wood&#x27;s 70th birthday. Despite receiving critical acclaim, the movie did poorly at the box office; however, it has since developed a cult following.

In 1996, Reverend Steve Galindo of Seminole, Oklahoma, created a legally recognized religion with Wood as its official savior. Founded as a joke, the Church of Ed Wood now boasts more than 3,500 baptized followers. Woodites, as Galindo&#x27;s followers are called, celebrate &quot;Woodmas&quot; on October 10, which was Wood&#x27;s birthday. Numerous parties and concerts are held worldwide to celebrate Woodmas. On October 4–5, 2003, horror host Mr. Lobo was canonized as the &quot;Patron Saint of late night movie hosts and insomniacs&quot; in the Church of Ed Wood.

In 1997 the University of Southern California began holding an annual &quot;Ed Wood Film Festival&quot;, in which student teams are challenged to write, film, and edit an Ed Wood-inspired short film based on a preassigned theme. Past themes have included &quot;Rebel Without a Bra&quot; (2004), &quot;What&#x27;s That in Your Pocket?&quot; (2005), and &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; (2006).

===Documentaries===

* The Incredibly Strange Film Show (Season 2, Episode 4), presented by Jonathan Ross. It was first broadcast Oct. 13, 1989. Guests interviewed included actors Vampira (aka Maila Nurmi), Norma McCarty, Paul Marco, Dolores Fuller, biographer Rudolph Grey and critic Harry Medved.
* Flying Saucers Over Hollywood: The Plan 9 Companion, was released in 1992. This exhaustive two-hour documentary by Mark Patrick Carducci chronicles the making of &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot; and features interviews with Vampira, Paul Marco, Conrad Brooks, Joe Dante, Valda Hansen, artist Drew Friedman, Forrest J. Ackerman, Gary Gerani, Sam Raimi, Kathy Wood, Carl Anthony, Harry Thomas, Gregory Walcott, Stephen Apostolof, Martha Mason, Norma McCarty, Dolores Fuller, et al.

* The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood Jr., written and directed by Brett Thompson, came out in 1995. This 90-minute documentary—about the life and films of Ed Wood—features interviews with Wood&#x27;s friends and co-workers, and closely resembles Wood&#x27;s own style albeit with slightly better miniatures. People interviewed included Maila Nurmi, Bela Lugosi Jr., Dolores Fuller, Paul Marco, Conrad Brooks, Loretta King, Lyn Lemon, Norma McCarty and her son Mike, Mona McKinnon, Lyle Talbot, Gregory Walcott, Crawford John Thomas, makeup man Harry Thomas and Ed Wood himself.
* Dad Made Dirty Movies (2011) Wood biographer Rudolph Grey produced this one-hour documentary about the life and career of 1960s porn film producer Stephen Apostolof, detailing his x-rated co-productions with Wood.

===Lost films===
Wood&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;The Undergraduate&quot; was a lost film, as was his 1970 film &quot;Take It Out in Trade&quot;, but they both eventually turned up years later. (Both films in their entirety are now available on DVD.)

An 80-minute print of &quot;Take It Out in Trade&quot; was discovered and publicly exhibited at Anthology Film Archives in New York City in September 2014. Silent outtakes from the film were released by Something Weird Video.

Wood&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;Necromania&quot; was also believed lost for years, until an edited version resurfaced at a yard sale in 1992, followed in 2001 by a complete, unedited print.

A complete print of Wood&#x27;s lost 1972 pornographic film &quot;The Young Marrieds&quot; was discovered in 2004. It was released by Alpha Blue Archives in July 2014 as a part of the four-DVD set &quot;The Lost Sex Films of Ed Wood Jr.&quot;.

Wood is said to have filmed some scenes of Lon Chaney Jr. in a werewolf costume in Hollywood in 1964 that were said to have been incorporated into Jerry Warren&#x27;s film &quot;Face of the Screaming Werewolf&quot; (1965). Chaney biographer Don G. Smith however has stated that this story was never substantiated.

<text>EDIF (Electronic Design Interchange Format) is a vendor-neutral format based on S-expressions in which to store electronic netlists and schematics. It was one of the first attempts to establish a neutral data exchange format for the electronic design automation (EDA) industry. The goal was to establish a common format from which the proprietary formats of the EDA systems could be derived. When customers needed to transfer data from one system to another, it was necessary to write translators from one format to other. As the number of formats (&quot;N&quot;) multiplied, the translator issue became an &quot;N&quot;-squared problem. The expectation was that with EDIF the number of translators could be reduced to the number of involved systems.

Representatives of the EDA companies Daisy Systems, Mentor Graphics, Motorola, National Semiconductor, Tektronix, Texas Instruments and the University of California, Berkeley established the &quot;EDIF Steering Committee&quot; in November 1983. Later Hilary Kahn, a computer science professor at the University of Manchester, joined the team and led the development from version EDIF 2 0 0 till the final version 4 0 0.

== Syntax ==

The general format of EDIF involves using parentheses to delimit data definitions, and in this way it superficially resembles Lisp. The basic tokens of EDIF 2.0.0 were keywords (like &quot;library&quot;, &quot;cell&quot;, &quot;instance&quot;, etc.), strings (delimited with double quotes), integer numbers, symbolic constants (e.g. &quot;GENERIC&quot;, &quot;TIE&quot;, &quot;RIPPER&quot; for cell types) and &quot;Identifiers&quot;, which are reference labels formed from a very restricted set of characters. 
EDIF 3.0.0 and 4.0.0 dropped the symbolic constants entirely, using keywords instead.
So, the syntax of EDIF has a fairly simple foundation. A typical EDIF file looks like this: 

(edif fibex (edifVersion 2 0 0)
 (edifLevel 0) (keywordMap (keywordLevel 0))
 (status (written (timeStamp 1995 1 1 1 1 1) (program &quot;xxx&quot; (version &quot;v1&quot;))))
 (library xxx (edifLevel 0)
 (technology (numberDefinition (scale 1 (e 1 -6) (unit distance))))
 (cell dff_4 (cellType generic)
 (view view1 (viewType netlist)
 (interface
 (port aset (direction INPUT))
 (port clok (direction INPUT))
 (cell yyy (cellType generic)
 (view schematic_ (viewType netlist)
 (interface
 (port CLEAR (direction INPUT))
 (port CLOCK (direction INPUT)) ... )
 (contents
 (instance I_36_1 (viewRef view1 (cellRef dff_4)))
 (instance (rename I_36_3 &quot;I$3&quot;) (viewRef view1 (cellRef addsub_4)))
 (net CLEAR
 (joined
 (portRef CLEAR)
 (portRef aset (instanceRef I_36_1))
 (portRef aset (instanceRef I_36_3))))


== Revision history ==

EDIF Version 1 0 0 in 1985

EDIF Version 1 1 0 in 1986

=== EDIF 2 0 0 ===
The first &quot;real&quot; public release of EDIF was version 2 0 0, which was approved in March 1988 as the standard ANSI/EIA-548-1988. It is published in a single volume. This version has no formal scope statement but what it tries to capture is covered by the defined viewTypes:
* &quot;BEHAVIOR to describe the behavior of a cell&quot;
* &quot;DOCUMENT to describe the documentation of a cell&quot;
* &quot;GRAPHIC to describe a &quot;dumb&quot; graphics and text representation of displayable or printable information&quot;
* &quot;LOGICMODEL to describe the logic-simulation model of the cell&quot;
* &quot;MASKLAYOUT to describe an integrated circuit layout&quot;
* &quot;NETLIST to describe a netlist&quot;
* &quot;PCBLAYOUT to describe a printed circuit board&quot;
* &quot;SCHEMATIC to describe the schematic representation and connectivity of a cell&quot;
* &quot;STRANGER to describe an as yet unknown representation of a cell&quot;
* &quot;SYMBOLIC to describe a symbolic layout&quot;
The industry tested this release for several years, but finally only the NETLIST view was the one widely used and some EDA tools are still supporting it today for EDIF 2 0 0.

To overcome problems with the main 2 0 0 standard several further documents got released:
* Electronic Industries Association
** &quot;EDIF Monograph Series, Volume 1, Introduction to EDIF&quot;, EIA/EDIF-1, Sept. 1988
** &quot;EDIF Monograph Series, Volume 2, EDIF Connectivity&quot;, EIA/EDIF-2, June 1989
** &quot;Using EDIF 2 0 0 for schematic transfer&quot;, EIA/EDIF/AG-1, July 1989
* Documentation from Hilary J. Kahn, Department of Computer Science, University of Manchester
** &quot;EDIF 2 0 0, An Introductory Tutorial&quot;, September 1989
** &quot;EDIF Questions and answers, volume one&quot;, November 1988
** &quot;EDIF Questions and answers, volume two&quot;, February 1989
** &quot;EDIF Questions and answers, volume three&quot;, July 1989
** &quot;EDIF Questions and answers, volume four&quot;, November 1989
** &quot;EDIF Questions and answers, volume five&quot;, June 1991

=== EDIF 2 9 0 ===
Released on 15 September 1992.

=== EDIF 3 0 0 ===
Because of some fundamental weaknesses in the 2 0 0 release a new not compatible release 3 0 0 was released in September 1993, given the designation of EIA standard EIA-618. It later achieved ANSI and ISO designations. It is published in 4 volumes. The main focus of this version were the viewTypes NETLIST and SCHEMATIC from 2 0 0. MASKLAYOUT, PCBLAYOUT and some other views were dropped from this release and shifted for later releases because the work for these views was not fully completed.

EDIF 3 0 0 is available from the International Electrotechnical Commission as IEC 61690-1

=== EDIF 4 0 0 ===
EDIF 4 0 0 was released in late August 1996, mainly to add &quot;Printed Circuit Board&quot; extensions (the original PCBLAYOUT view) to EDIF 3 0 0. This more than doubled the size of EDIF 3 0 0, and is published in HTML format on CD.

EDIF 4 0 0 is available from the International Electrotechnical Commission as IEC 61690-2

== Evolution ==
=== Problems with 2 0 0 ===

To understand the problems users and vendors encountered with EDIF 2 0 0, one first has to picture all the elements and dynamics of the electronics industry. The people who needed this standard were mainly design engineers, who worked for companies whose size ranged from a house garage to multi-billion dollar facilities with thousands of engineers. These engineers worked mainly from schematics and netlists in the late 1980s, and the big push was to generate the netlists from the schematics automatically. The first suppliers were Electronic Design Automation vendors (e.g., Daisy, Mentor, and Valid formed the earliest predominating set). These companies competed vigorously for their shares of this market.

One of the tactics used by these companies to &quot;capture&quot; their customers was their proprietary databases. Each had special features that the others did not. Once a decision was made to use a particular vendor&#x27;s software to enter a design, the customer was ever after constrained to use no other software. To move from vendor A&#x27;s to vendor B&#x27;s systems usually meant a very expensive re-entry of almost all design data by hand into the new system. This expense of &quot;migration&quot; was the main factor that locked design engineers into using a single vendor.

But the &quot;customers&quot; had a different desire. They saw immediately that while vendor A might have a really nice analog simulation environment, vendor B had a much better PCB or silicon layout auto-router. And they wished that they could pick and choose amongst the different vendors.

EDIF was mainly supported by the electronics design end-users, and their companies. The EDA vendors were involved also, but their motivation was more along the lines of wanting to not alienate their customers. Most of the EDA vendors produced EDIF 2 0 0 translators, but they were definitely more interested in generating high-quality EDIF readers, and they had absolutely no motivation at all to write any software that generated EDIF (an EDIF Writer), beyond threats from customers of mass migration to another vendor&#x27;s software.

The result was rather interesting. Hardly any software vendor wrote EDIF 2 0 0 output that did not have severe violations of syntax or semantics. The semantics were just loose enough that there might be several ways to describe the same data. This began to be known as &quot;flavors&quot; of EDIF. The vendor companies did not always feel it important to allocate many resources to EDIF products, even if they sold a large number of them. There were several stories of active products with virtually no-one to maintain them for years. User complaints were merely gathered and prioritized. The harder it became to export customer data to EDIF, the more the vendors seemed to like it. Those who did write EDIF translators found they spent a huge amount of time and effort on generating sufficiently powerful, forgiving, artificially intelligent readers, that could handle and piece together the poor-quality code produced by the extant EDIF 2 0 0 writers of the day.

In designing EDIF 3 0 0, the committees were well aware of the faults of the language, the calumny heaped on EDIF 2 0 0 by the vendors and the frustration of the end users. So, to tighten the semantics of the language, and provide a more formal description of the standard, the revolutionary approach was taken to provide an information model for EDIF, in the information modeling language EXPRESS. This helped to better document the standard, but was done more as an afterthought, as the syntax crafting was done independently of the model, instead of being generated from the model. Also, even though the standard says that if the syntax and model disagree, the model is the standard, this is not the case in practice. The BNF description of the syntax is the foundation of the language inasmuch as the software that does the day-to-day work of producing design descriptions is based on a fixed syntax. The information model also suffered from the fact that it was not (and is not) ideally suited to describing EDIF. It does not describe such concepts as name spaces very well at all, and the differences between a definition and a reference is not clearly describable either. Also, the constructs in EXPRESS for describing constraints might be formal, but constraint description is a fairly complicated matter at times. So, most constraints ended up just being described as comments. Most of the others became elaborate formal descriptions which most readers will never be able to decipher, and therefore may not stand up to automated debugging/compiling, just as a program might look good in review, but a compiler might find some interesting errors, and actually running the program written might find even more interesting errors. (Additionally, analogous EXPRESS compilers/executors didn&#x27;t exist when the standard was written, and may not still exist today!)

=== Solutions to EDIF 2 0 0 problems ===

The solution to the &quot;flavor&quot; problem of EDIF 2 0 0 was to develop a more specific semantic description in EDIF 3 0 0 (1993). Indeed, reported results of people generating EDIF 3 0 0 translators was that the writers were now &quot;much&quot; more difficult to get right, due to the great number of semantic restrictions, and the readers are comparatively trivial to develop.

The solution to vendor &quot;conflict of interest&quot; was neutral third-party companies, who could provide EDIF products based on vendor interfaces. This separation of the EDIF products from direct vendor control was critical to providing the end-user community with tools that worked well. It formed naturally and without comment. Engineering DataXpress was perhaps the first such company in this realm, with Electronic Tools Company seeming to have captured the market in the mid to late 1990s. Another dynamic in this industry is EDIF itself. Since they have grown to a rather large size, generating readers and writers has become a very expensive proposition. Usually the third-party companies have congregated the necessary specialists and can use this expertise to more efficiently generate the software. They are also able to leverage code sharing and other techniques an individual vendor could not. By 2000, almost no major vendor produced its own EDIF tools, choosing instead to OEM third-party tools.

Since the release of EDIF 4 0 0, the entire EDIF standards organisation has essentially dissolved. There have been no published meetings of any of the technical subcommittees, the EDIF Experts group, etc. Most of the individuals involved have moved on to other companies or efforts. The newsletter was abandoned, and the Users&#x27; Group no longer holds yearly meetings. EDIF 3 0 0 and 4 0 0 are now ANSI, IEC and European (EN) standards. EDIF Version 3 0 0 is IEC/EN 61690-1, and EDIF Version 4 0 0 is IEC/EN 61690-2.

=== EDIF descendants ===
* LKSoft took major concepts from EDIF 2 0 0 to create a proprietary data format with the default extension &quot;.cam&quot; for their CircuitCAM system offered originally by LPKF Laser &amp; Electronics AG in Garbsen/Hannover, Germany and today owned by DCT Co., Ltd. in Tianjn, China. To efficiently work on EDIF like formats LKSoft has developed the &quot;EDIF Procedural Interface&quot;, an API for the C programming language.
* Zuken, formerly Racal-Redac Ltd., took concepts from the early EDIF 4 0 0 development to create a new proprietary format called CADIF for their Visula PCB-CAD system. This format is also widely used by 3rd party vendors.
* STEP-AP210, a part of ISO 10303, practically inherited all of the EDIF 4 0 0 functionality except for schematics.

<doc id="10528" wikidata="Q693519" url="?curid=10528" title="Essential tremor">
<text>Essential tremor (ET), also called benign tremor, familial tremor, and idiopathic tremor, is a medical condition characterized by involuntary rhythmic contractions and relaxations (oscillations or twitching movements) of certain muscle groups in one or more body parts of unknown cause. It is typically symmetrical, and affects the arms, hands, or fingers; but sometimes involves the head, vocal cords, or other body parts. Essential tremor is either an &quot;action&quot; (intention) tremor—it intensifies when one tries to use the affected muscles during voluntary movements such as eating and writing—or it is a &quot;postural&quot; tremor, which occurs when holding arms outstretched and against gravity. This means that it is distinct from a resting tremor, such as that caused by Parkinson&#x27;s disease, which is not correlated with movement. Unlike Parkinson&#x27;s disease, essential tremor may worsen with action.

Essential tremor is a progressive neurological disorder, and the most common movement disorder. Though not life-threatening, it can certainly be debilitating. Its onset is usually between 40 and 50 years of age, but it can occur at any age. The cause is poorly understood. Diagnosis is made by observing the typical pattern of the tremor coupled with the exclusion of known causes of such a tremor. There is currently no medical test available to identify an essential tremor.

While essential tremor is distinct from Parkinson&#x27;s disease, which causes a resting tremor, essential tremor is nevertheless sometimes misdiagnosed as Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Some patients have been found to have both essential tremors and resting tremors.

Treatments for essential tremor include medications, typically given sequentially to determine which provides the most efficacy with least side effects. &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot; toxin (Botox) injections and ultrasound are also sometimes used for cases refractory to medications.

==Signs and symptoms==
The tremors linked with essential tremor are generally action tremors, which means they occur during intentional movements rather than when the body is at rest.

In mild cases, ET can manifest as the inability to stop the tongue or hands from shaking, the ability to sing only in vibrato, and difficulty doing small, precise tasks such as threading a needle. Even simple tasks such as cutting in a straight line or using a ruler can range from difficult to impossible, depending on the severity of the condition. In disabling cases, ET can interfere with a person&#x27;s activities of daily living, including feeding, dressing, and taking care of personal hygiene. Essential tremor generally presents as a rhythmic tremor (4–12 Hz) that occurs only when the affected muscle is exerting effort. Any sort of physical or mental stress tends to make the tremor worse.

The tremor may also occur in the head (neck), jaw, and voice, as well as other body regions, with the general pattern being that the tremor begins in the arms and then spreads to these other regions in some people. Women are more likely to develop the head tremor than are men, and it is also found to be more severe in women than men. In people with essential tremor (ET), the head tremor can be either vertical (&quot;yes-yes&quot;) or horizontal (&quot;no-no&quot;) and is typically accompanied by tremors in the hands or voice. Other types of tremor may also occur, including postural tremor of the outstretched arms, intention tremor of the arms, and rest tremor in the arms. In one study, men had more severe postural hand tremor when compared to women. Some people may have unsteadiness and problems with gait and balance. Abnormal tandem gait was more commonly observed in older ET people and those with more than 5 years of disease duration.

ET-related tremors do not occur during sleep, but people with ET sometimes complain of an especially coarse tremor upon awakening that becomes noticeably less coarse within the first few minutes of wakefulness. Tremor and disease activity can intensify in response to fatigue, strong emotions, low blood sugar, extreme cold and heat, caffeine, lithium salts, some antidepressants, stress, and other factors.

Parkinson&#x27;s disease and parkinsonism can also occur simultaneously with ET. The degree of tremor, rigidity, and functional disability did not differ from patients with idiopathic Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Hand tremor predominated (as it did in Parkinson&#x27;s disease), and occurred in nearly all cases, followed by head tremor, voice tremor, neck, face, leg, tongue, and trunk tremor. Most other tremors occurred in association with hand tremor. More severe tremors, a lower sleep disorder frequency, and a similar prevalence of other non-motor symptoms also can occur. A non-motor feature such as hearing impairment has been shown to have higher prevalence in those with ET compared with those that are healthy or with Parkinson&#x27;s. Cochlear pathologies which affect the inner ear are proposed as the potential cause, but there is still insufficient information regarding retrocochlear pathologies (affects central or neural nerve) and central auditory processing.

Walking difficulties in essential tremor are common. About half of patients have associated dystonia, including cervical dystonia, writer&#x27;s cramp, spasmodic dysphonia, and cranial dystonia, and 20% of the patients had associated parkinsonism. Olfactory dysfunction (loss of sense of smell) is common in Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and has also been reported to occur in patients with essential tremor. A number of patients with essential tremor also exhibit many of the same neuropsychiatric disturbances seen in idiopathic Parkinson&#x27;s disease. The similarity in characteristics between parkinsonism and essential tremor can make it difficult to distinguish between the two at times.

Essential tremor with tremor onset after the age of 65 has been associated with mild cognitive impairment, as well as dementia, although the link between these conditions, if any, is still not understood. Familial cases of ET tend to present at younger ages, whereas older ages of onset are linked to faster progression of the disease.

Essential tremor has two tremor components, central and peripheral. These two tremor components were identified by measuring the tremor of ET patients once with no weights on their hands and then with 1-pound weights on their hands. The addition of the weights resulted in a tremor spectrum with two peaks, one that maintained the same frequency (the central tremor) and one that decreased in frequency (the peripheral tremor). Only with the addition of the weights was the peripheral tremor distinguishable from the central tremor.

The frequency of essential tremor is 4 to 12 Hz, depending on which body segment is affected. Previously, it was 4 to 11 Hz according to the American Family Physician on Classification of Tremors and Treatment Update. Proximal segments are affected at lower frequencies, and distal segments are affected at higher frequencies.

==Cause==
Essential Tremor was once thought to be a single disease state, however, research shows that there are multiple factors that are associated with causing Essential Tremor. This leads to the consideration that Essential Tremor is more akin to a family of diseases, due to the presence of both genetic (familial) and sporadic Essential Tremors. Currently, there are multiple main hypotheses behind Essential Tremor, being the degeneration of the cerebellum, inheriting the tremor, ingestion of toxins, or the presence of Lewy Bodies in the brainstem. However, &quot;post mortem&quot; studies showed that only a small number of patients had Lewy Bodies, and was more common for patients not to exhibit them.

Cerebellar

It is unknown how the degeneration of the cerebellum leads to Essential Tremor, however, it is hypothesized that it may be due to the loss of Purkinje cells, as they release gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter meant to control the firing of neurons in the cerebellum. In certain Essential Tremor clinical studies which augment the GABA pathway, only some participants exhibited a reduction of tremor. Some patients have responded to alcohol, claiming alcohol has reduced the tremor, however the reduction is only short term. However, alcohol might only be beneficial for those with an impacted GABA pathway, and may not be benefit patients who developed the tremor via other pathways.

===Genetic===
The main underlying cause of essential tremor is not clear, but many cases seem to be familial. About half of the cases are due to a genetic mutation and the pattern of inheritance is most consistent with autosomal dominant transmission, meaning patients with Essential Tremor have around a 50% chance to pass it on to their children. There are multiple gene mutations and presentations on various chromosomes that lead to Essential Tremor. These include genes present on chromosomes 1–3, 6, 11, and 16. Each presentation or mutation of different genes were associated with families from different regions. For example, presentation of a gene associated with Essential Tremor on chromosome 6 has been noted in North American families, while a Canadian family was noted with mutations in the fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS) gene. Other mutations in genes such as the HTRA Serine Peptidase 2 (HTRA2) and the teneurin transmembrane protein 4 (TENM4), have been observed in a Turkish family and the Spanish population respectively. Recent &quot;post mortem&quot; studies have displayed alterations in the leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing protein 1 (&quot;LINGO1&quot;) gene and GABA receptors in the cerebellum of people with essential tremor. &quot;HAPT1 &quot;mutations have also been linked to ET, as well as to Parkinson&#x27;s disease, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy.

===Poisons and toxins===
Some environmental poisons, including toxins, are also under active investigation, as they may play a role in the disease&#x27;s cause. Exposure to heavy metals, specifically lead, has been associated with causation of ET. Lead is a heavy metal that can cross the central nervous system&#x27;s (CNS) main line of defense, the blood–brain barrier, even increasing its permeability, allowing other harmful substances to access the CNS. This allows lead access to the CNS, permitting it to disturb processes that utilize calcium, including synaptic activity, and causes intracellular disruption, both of which may lead to irreversible damage to the CNS. This would include cerebellar damage which could cause ET. There are other poisons that work in a similar manner to lead such as other heavy metals like mercury and aluminum, as well as toxic chemicals like certain pesticides and alcohol. In particular, excessive alcohol consumption can worsen essential tremor due to damage to the cerebellum.

==Pathophysiology==
Essential tremor is one of the most prevalent and poorly-understood neurological disorders. Clinical, physiological and imaging studies point to involvement of the cerebellum and/or cerebellothalamocortical circuits. The traditional model for essential tremor, the olivary hypothesis, suggests that ET is caused by abnormal electrical activity in the inferior olivary nucleus. This activity makes neurons fire in a regular, synchronized way, which then disrupts signals to the cerebellum and leads to tremors. However, recent studies, especially those examining brain tissue, propose a new hypothesis that ET may be a neurodegenerative disease focused in the cerebellum, differing from the old theory. Changes in the cerebellum could also be mediated by alcoholic beverage consumption. Purkinje cells are especially susceptible to ethanol excitotoxicity. Impairment of Purkinje synapses is a component of cerebellar degradation that could underlie essential tremor. Some cases have Lewy bodies in the locus ceruleus. ET cases that progress to Parkinson&#x27;s disease are less likely to have had cerebellar problems. Recent neuroimaging studies have suggested that the efficiency of the overall brain functional network in ET is disrupted.

In 2012, the National Toxicology Program concluded that sufficient evidence exists of an association between blood lead exposure at levels &gt;10 μg/dl and essential tremor in adults, and limited evidence at blood lead levels &gt;5 μg/dl.

==Diagnosis==
Usually, the diagnosis is established on clinical grounds. Although ET was long considered a single-symptom illness, recent studies have shown that some patients also experience other additional motor symptoms and non-motor features. According to recent medical literature, besides isolated essential tremor, there are two additional classifications: &#x27;ET plus&#x27; and &#x27;ET-PD.&#x27; &#x27;ET plus&#x27; is diagnosed when patients show cognitive impairments or other motor symptoms like ataxia, dystonia, or resting tremor. &#x27;ET-PD&#x27; is used for those who meet the criteria for both ET and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. The clinical features of tremor in a patient include medical history (such as age of onset, family history, progression over time, and exposure to drugs or toxins), tremor characteristics (like which parts of the body are affected, when the tremor occurs, and its frequency), and any associated signs(such as signs of systemic illness, neurological signs, and soft signs). For some types of tremors, additional tests like recording tremor frequency, imaging for lesions, receptor imaging, and biomarkers in blood or tissue may help identify the cause. Tremors can start at any age, from birth through advanced ages (senile tremor). Any voluntary muscle in the body may be affected, although the tremor is most commonly seen in the hands and arms and slightly less commonly in the neck (causing the person&#x27;s head to shake), tongue, and legs. A resting tremor of the hands is sometimes present. Tremor occurring in the legs might be diagnosable as orthostatic tremor. Tremors in the lower limbs are quite rare in ET and are more likely to indicate Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

ET occurs within multiple neurological disorders besides Parkinson&#x27;s disease. This includes migraine disorders, where co-occurrences between ET and migraines have been examined.

==Treatment==
===Treatment approaches===
Currently, most treatments and therapies available for essential tremors are only treating symptoms since there is no cure available. Medical treatments for tremors are based on shared decisions between patients and their providers. The choices of treatments depended on tremor severity, affected body parts, and the impacts of tremor on the patient&#x27;s physical, psychological, and quality of life. People with mild tremors that do not interfere with daily activities and psychological well-being do not require pharmacological treatments. People with persistent tremors which impact daily functions and social interactions should be treated with the appropriate pharmacological therapies.

==== Non-pharmacological Treatment ====
&quot;Focused Ultrasound&quot; is a treatment that was approved for coverage in the U.S. in 2022 for those with Medicare insurance. Totally non-surgical, the treatment process is performed on a conscious patient and takes 2 to 3 hours.

The first approach in helping people to improve tremor symptoms is the discontinuation of triggering and exacerbating factors like medications including certain antidepressants, anti-epileptics, beta-agonists; or substances like caffeine. In addition, getting adequate sleep and utilizing relaxation techniques can also help improve and reduce tremor symptoms in individuals who reported an increase in tremors following physical activities.

Since tremors can affect different parts of the body (like limbs, head, chin/jaw, and vocal), different non-pharmacological therapeutic techniques are available that can support patients with the management of tremors including occupational therapy, speech therapy, and psychotherapy. Occupational therapy provides support to help people manage everyday tasks more easily through different approaches and interventions. Speech therapy is helpful in people with vocal tremor to help manage and maintain the vocal changes associated with tremor symptoms. Psychological impacts like embarrassment and anxiety are also important concerns of many people with ET which can lead to social isolation and depression. Psychotherapy can be very beneficial and play a key role in helping people to improve the mental health of ET people.

==== Alcohol ====
Alcohol had been known to help provide short-term relief of tremor symptoms in some people, however, the therapeutic effects of alcohol on ET had not been studied in many clinical trials. It has been proposed that alcohol can help reduce tremors through the agonism mechanism of the gamma-aminobutyric acid GABAergic. Since GABA can decrease neural activity, it is believed that alcohol can increase the activity of GABA which then can reduce involuntary muscle movements or tremors. However, the duration of action of alcohol on ET is around 3–4 hours, alcohol also had been associated with the rebound of tremor, not to mention the risk of development of long-term alcohol consumption and abuse. The use of alcohol as a possible treatment for ET is not recommended by healthcare providers.

===Pharmacological Treatments===
Currently, The available pharmacological therapy options for ET are Beta-adrenergic blockers, Anticonvulsants, Benzodiazepines/GABAergic agents, Calcium channel blockers, and Atypical neuroleptic agents. The two most effective medications which had been approved by the FDA as first line agents for the treatment of ET are propranolol and primidone.
====Beta-adrenergic Blockers====

When symptoms are sufficiently troublesome to warrant treatment, the first choice medication is propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, which has been shown effective in reducing tremor by 70% in 50% of patients in clinical studies. Based on the guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and the Italian Movement Disorders Association, propranolol is most effective in limb tremors, also there is little to no effect on head tremors. The recommended doses of propranolol range from 60 to 360 mg daily, and it is based on the patient&#x27;s specific factors. The commonly reported side effects of propranolol are bradycardia, bronchospasm, fatigue, and hypotension. In patients that have contraindicated comorbidities to propranolol, other beta-blockers such as Atenolol, pindolol, Sotalol, and nadolol have shown some potential efficacy, but they are not very well studied and have limited evidence in their efficacy on the treatment of ET.

==== Anticonvulsants ====

Primidone is another first line agent recommended in the treatment of ET. Primidone is an anticonvulsant which metabolized into phenobarbital and phenylethymalnonamide. This medication has shown the same beneficial effects in reducing tremors as propranolol and is recommended for use based on guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and the MDS Task Force on Tremor. The initial dose of primidone is recommended at 25 mg per day and should be increased up to the maximum dose of 250 mg per day. This strategy was recommended to help avoid the possible side effects of nausea, vomiting, and excessive sedation of primidone. Primidone is the preferred medication for the treatment of ET in the geriatric population compared to propranolol. In addition, Combination therapy of both Propranolol and Primidone is recommended for people who do not show benefits from either propranolol or primidone as monotherapy.

Topiramate is an antiepileptic medication which had been studied to assess the efficacy and safety in the treatment of ET. Overall, it is considered a second-line therapy alone or in combination with other medications when first-line treatments fail to show improvement or medication intolerance. Topiramate has been shown effective in reducing limb tremors at the maximum dose of 200 mg, however, there was a higher risk for the development of adverse effects including weight loss, anorexia, cognitive impairment, and kidney stones.

====Other second-line medications====
Additional medications that have been reported to show efficacy in treating ET are gabapentin, benzodiazepines such as alprazolam, clonazepam, and zonisamide, and pregabalin. However, most of the medications have limited evidence-based to support their clinical usage as treatments for ET. Some systematic reviews of medications for the treatment of ET have been conducted. A 2017 review of topiramate found limited data and low-quality evidence to support its efficacy and the occurrence of treatment-limiting adverse effects, a 2017 review of zonisamide found insufficient information to assess efficacy and safety, and a 2016 review of pregabalin determined the effects to be uncertain due to the low quality of evidence.

==== Botulinum Toxin (BoNT) ====
Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin produced by a gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria called Clostridium botulinum. BoNT works by inhibiting acetylcholine release at the presynaptic terminal by inactivating the SNARE proteins (SNAP-25), which interfere with muscle contraction. BoNT type A injections have shown benefits in several clinical trials for the treatments of limb, voice, and head. However, the associated side effects included muscle weakness, stiffness reported within studies of limb tremors, and neck muscle pain, weakness, and dysphagia in clinical trials of head tremors. Botulinum toxin type A has been found to be helpful in treating voice tremors.

=== Additional procedures ===

====Ultrasound====

Additionally, MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound is a nonsurgical treatment option for people with essential tremor who are medication refractory. MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound does not achieve healing, but can improve the quality of life by reducing the tremor manifestation. While its long-term effects are not yet established, the improvement in tremor score from baseline was durable at 1 year and 2 years following the treatment. To date, reported adverse events and side effects have been mild to moderate. Possible adverse events include gait difficulties, balance disturbances, paresthesias, headache, skin burns with ulcerations, skin retraction, scars, and blood clots. This procedure is contraindicated in pregnant women, persons who have non-MRI compatible implanted metallic devices, allergy to MR contrast agents, cerebrovascular disease, abnormal bleeding, hemorrhage and/or blood clotting disorders, advanced kidney disease or on dialysis, heart conditions, severe hypertension, and ethanol or substance abuse, among others. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Insightec&#x27;s Exablate Neuro system to treat essential tremor in 2016.

==== Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) ====

Another invasive surgical treatment of essential tremor is deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is a surgical procedure that involves the placement of a permanent electrode with 4-8 contacts within the brain with connecting wires connected to a pulse stimulator implanted near the patient&#x27;s collarbone. In the treatment of tremor, the electrodes are placed in the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus.

The pulse stimulator delivers constant electrical pulses to the target area, which interfere with activity of the target area, which has been shown to improve tremor symptoms. At one year following the surgical intervention with DBS, patients showed 66% improvement and 48% improvement at 10 years. DBS is considering an effective surgical treatment of ET, but there are associated side effects and complications that have been reported with DBS in clinical trials, including imbalance or gait instability, dystonia, paresthesia, hemorrhage.

== Prognosis ==
Although essential tremor is often mild, people with severe tremor have difficulty performing many of their routine activities of daily living. ET is generally progressive in most cases (sometimes rapidly, sometimes very slowly), and can be disabling in severe cases.

== Epidemiology ==
Essential tremor (ET) is a common neurological disorder, affecting up to 5% of the global population, with approximately 24.91 million people affected worldwide in 2020. The prevalence of ET increases significantly with age, particularly in individuals aged 60 and above. It affects around 4% of people aged 40 and older, and the prevalence rises to 2.87% in those over 80, reaching up to 20% in individuals in their 90s and beyond. ET is more common in males than females across all age groups.

Family history plays a significant role in the development of ET, with around 50% of cases being hereditary and a 90% concordance rate in identical twins. While the likelihood of developing ET increases with age, it can also occur in younger individuals, especially if there is a family history of the disorder. ET is one of the most common types of tremor, aside from enhanced physiological tremor, and is among the most frequently observed movement disorders.

== Society and culture ==
Actress Katharine Hepburn (1907–2003) had an essential tremor, possibly inherited from her grandfather, that caused her head—and sometimes her hands—to shake. The tremor was noticeable by the time of her performance in the 1979 film &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot;, when critics mentioned the &quot;palsy that kept her head trembling&quot;. Hepburn&#x27;s tremor worsened in her later life.

Charles M. Schulz, American cartoonist and creator of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip, was affected during the last two decades of his life.

West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd also had essential tremor.

In 2010, musician Daryl Dragon of The Captain and Tennille was diagnosed with essential tremor; the condition became so severe that he was no longer able to play the keyboards.

Director-writer-producer-comedian Adam McKay was diagnosed with essential tremor.

&quot;Downton Abbey&quot; creator Julian Fellowes has the condition, as does the show&#x27;s character Charlie Carson.

In 2022, Matthew Caws of Nada Surf and his son made a PSA called &quot;Living with a Mild Essential Tremor&quot;.

==Research==
Harmaline is a widely used model of essential tremor (ET) in rodents. Harmaline is thought to act primarily on neurons in the inferior olive. Olivocerebellar neurons exhibit rhythmic excitatory action when harmaline is applied locally. Harmane or harmaline has been implicated not only in essential tremors, but is also found in greater quantities in the brain fluid of people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and cancer. Higher levels of the neurotoxin are associated with greater severity of the tremors. Harmane is particularly abundant in meats, and certain cooking practices (e.g., long cooking times) increase its concentration, but at least one study has shown that harmane blood concentrations do not go up after meat consumption in ET patients with already elevated harmane levels, whereas the control group&#x27;s harmane levels increase accordingly, suggesting that another factor, such as a metabolic defect, may be responsible for the higher harmane levels in ET patients.

Caprylic acid is being researched as a possible treatment for essential tremor. It has currently been approved by the FDA and designated as GRAS, and is used as a food additive and has been studied as part of a ketogenic diet for treatment of epilepsy in children. Research on caprylic acid as a possible treatment for ET began because researchers recognized that ethanol was effective in reducing tremor, and because of this, they looked into longer-chain alcohols reducing tremor. They discovered that 1-octanol reduced tremor and did not have the negative side effects of ethanol. Pharmacokinetic research on 1-octanol lead to the discovery that 1-octanol metabolized into caprylic acid in the body and that caprylic acid actually was the tremor-reducing agent. Many studies of the effects of caprylic acid on essential tremor have been done, including a dose-escalation study on ET patients and a study testing the effects of caprylic acid on central and peripheral tremor. The dose-escalation study examined doses of 8 mg/kg to 128 mg/kg and determined that these concentrations were safe with mild side effects. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached in this study. The study testing the effects of caprylic acid on central and peripheral tremors determined that caprylic acid reduced both.

== Terminology ==
This type of tremor is often referred to as &quot;kinetic tremor&quot;. Essential tremor has been known as &quot;benign essential tremor&quot;, but the adjective &quot;benign&quot; has been removed in recognition of the sometimes disabling nature of the disorder.

<doc id="10529" wikidata="Q2638457" url="?curid=10529" title="Book of Enos">
<text>The Book of Enos () is the fourth book in the Book of Mormon and is a portion of the small plates of Nephi. According to the text it was written by Enos, a Nephite prophet. Most scholars believe it to be a 19th century work by Joseph Smith.

Identity of Enos According to the Book of Mormon, Jacob had a son named &quot;Enos&quot; (see Jacob 7:27) and the Book of Enos follows immediately after the Book of Jacob in the manuscripts of the Book of Mormon and all printed editions. (See Jacob 7:27 to Enos 1:1.) However, in the opening verse of the Book of Enos (Enos 1:1), Enos mentions only his &quot;father&quot; and does not expressly affirm that his father was Jacob or that his uncle was Nephi. It is a reasonable assumption that Enos was the son of Jacob (of Jacob 7:27); but that relationship is not established in the text.

Given the issues that have been debated about how it could have been fully 179 years between the time when Lehi (and Nephi) left Jerusalem and when Enos &quot;began to be old&quot; (Enos 1:25) and was &quot;soon&quot; to &quot;go to the place of [his] rest&quot; (Enos 1:27), it is possible either that Jacob and Enos each lived to about 95 years of age, with Jacob fathering Enos late in life, or that Jacob had one son named Enos (as stated in Jacob 7:27) and yet that the Enos of the Book of Enos was another Enos altogether, perhaps, for example, a grandson or even great-grandson of Jacob. The identity of Enos of the Book of Enos is not necessarily established as the son of Jacob and grandson of Lehi and Sariah. Clearly, however, Enos&#x27;s ancestry leads directly to Lehi and Sariah through Jacob.

Summary of the Book of Enos This short book consists of a single chapter, relating Enos&#x27; conversion after praying all day and all night, following with his subsequent dialogue with the Lord. It also discusses the redemption of the Nephites and their enemies, the Lamanites, and contains prophecies of future Nephite and Lamanite generations. Additionally, it contains descriptions of the Lamanites. The style of Enos resembles that of Erich Auerbach in his &quot;&quot; and that of Nephi, Enos&#x27;s ancestor and the Book of Mormon&#x27;s opening narrator.

== Narrative ==
Enos hunts in the woods and remembers the gospel that his father taught him; as a result, he kneels and cries all day and during the night for the salvation of his soul. Then the voice of God tells Enos that he is forgiven of his sins. Enos believes the voice, but he wonders how the forgiveness is actually accomplished. In response, God explains that Enos is forgiven because he has faith in Jesus Christ, even though he has never seen or heard Christ.

Enos then prays for the salvation of the Nephites, but God says they will be blessed or punished according to their obedience. Enos, fearing that the Nephites will refuse to obey the commandments of God, then prays for the Lamanites who oppress them; he asks God for the Lamanites&#x27; preservation. Additionally, he prays that God will preserve a record of the Nephites so that someday the Lamanites too might be brought to salvation. Only faith in Christ will save them, but God makes a covenant with Enos that he will bring the records of the Nephites to the Lamanites in due time.

After this experience, Enos takes up the mantle of prophet and preaches among the Nephites, fearing their destruction. In the record, Enos does not say whether he is successful at converting the Nephites, but he does say the Nephites fail to convert the Lamanites. Before Enos dies he gives the records to his son Jarom.

== Portrayal of Lamanites ==
Throughout the narrative, Enos characterizes the Lamanites as possessing an unmoving hatred. According to Enos, the Lamanites become a wild, idolatrous, and bloodthirsty people, eating predatory animals. They live in tents, wander around in the wilderness, wear loincloths, shave their heads, and often eat raw meat. Enos explains that they are skilled with bows, cimeters, and axes and continually seek to destroy the Nephites.

Fatimah Salleh and Margaret Olsen Hemming noticed that Enos implies that Lamanite practices, like eating raw meat, connote corruption, even though the same behavior had no negative connotations earlier in the Book of Mormon when the Nephites and Lamanites were still one people. Thus, Enos demonstrates &quot;writer&#x27;s bias.&quot; Hemming and Salleh concluded that Enos&#x27;s criticism of the Lamanites is based more on prejudice and what is culturally acceptable to the Nephite rather than based on a charge from God.

== Book of Enos interpretation ==

Enos begins his account in a manner that is similar to Nephi&#x27;s: he mentions parental influence, passed on through religious counsel. The narrative not only begins with this but also ends with it. A difference from the style of Nephi is that Enos does not quote scripture in his narrative. Terryl L. Givens also argues that Enos&#x27; intended literary audience leans toward the Lamanites, as the Nephites will eventually be destroyed.

According to author Dennis Largey, the style of the Book of Enos implies that Enos did not narrate it over a long period of time but may have narrated it shortly before he died. On another note, literary critic Richard Rust compares the style and syntax of the Book of Enos and that of Erich Auerbach&#x27;s &quot;&quot; account of when Abraham is about to sacrifice Isaac. Specifically, Rust noticed in both accounts similar uses of modifiers as well as “and.” Additionally, Enos fills his narrative with words such as &quot;wrestling&quot; that generally appeal to a reader&#x27;s emotions, says Protestant theologian John Christopher Thomas. The familial and covenantal responsibilities that Enos feels bring a serious but personal flavor into the narrative, according to BYU English professor Sharon J. Harris.

<text>Environmental skepticism is the belief that statements by environmentalists, and the environmental scientists who support them, are false or exaggerated. The term is also applied to those who are critical of environmentalism in general. It can additionally be defined as doubt about the authenticity or severity of environmental degradation. Environmental skepticism is closely linked with anti-environmentalism and climate change denial. Environmental skepticism can also be the result of cultural and lived experiences.

== About ==

Environmental skeptics have argued that the extent of harm coming from human activities is less certain than scientists and scientific bodies say, or that it is too soon to be introducing curbs in these activities on the basis of existing evidence, or that further discussion is needed regarding who should pay for such environmental initiatives. One of the themes the movement focuses on is the idea that environmentalism is a growing threat to social and economic progress and the civil liberties.

The popularity of the term was enhanced by Bjørn Lomborg&#x27;s 2001 book &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot;. Lomborg approached environmental claims from a statistical and economic standpoint, and concluded that often the claims made by environmentalists were overstated. Lomborg argued, on the basis of cost–benefit analysis, that few environmentalist claims warranted serious concern. The book came under criticism by scientists noting that Lomborg misinterpreted or misrepresented data, criticized misuse of data while committing similar mistakes himself, examined issues supporting his thesis while ignoring information contrary to it, cherry picks literature, oversimplifies, fails to discuss uncertainty or subjectivity, cites mostly media sources, and largely ignores ecology.

Michael Shermer, who debated Lomborg on several topics from his book, notes that despite the scientific consensus many people are driven to environmental skepticism by the extremism inherent in both sides of the debate and not having been exposed to a sufficiently succinct and visual presentation of the available evidence.

In 2010, Lomborg refined his position and stated that he believes in the need for &quot;tens of billions of dollars a year to be invested in tackling climate change&quot; and declared global warming to be &quot;undoubtedly one of the chief concerns facing the world today&quot; and &quot;a challenge humanity must confront&quot;. He summarized his position, saying &quot;Global warming is real - it is man-made and it is an important problem. But it is not the end of the world.&quot;

A 2014 study of individuals from 32 countries found that environmental skepticism stems from insufficient education, self-assessed knowledge, religious/conservative values, lack of trust in society, mistrust of science, and other concerns trumping environmental concern.

=== Climate change skepticism ===

According to an annual poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, global warming has been a low public priority, ranking 29 out of 30 in the top priorities for the United States President and Congress. Additionally, in a list of 20 policy priorities, it ranks 19th.

Climate skeptics represent about a third of Americans according to national polls. This number makes it challenging for decision-makers who hesitate to implement environmental policies related to global warming and climate change. Anthony Leiserowitz, a professor from Yale, determined that the American community&#x27;s attitude towards climate change fall on a scale from concerned or alarmed to disengaged or dismissive. The term climate skeptic is made up of numerous components such as dubious, doubtful, dismissive, and denial. It does not describe simply a non-believer. In a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 61% of the public believed there was evidence of global warming. However, 35% of the public still believed there was no significant evidence for global temperature rise.

Climate skepticism is considered to be strictly an American belief constructed of governmental fear, scientific distrust, and interests in resource extraction that support a dominant Western lifestyle. Academics argue that we need to understand Americans underlying ideologies before we denote someone as a skeptic.

A cultural study on Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore helped discern some of the differing beliefs of Americans about environmental change. The study included three groups of residents who are dependent on the Eastern Shore of Maryland: commercial fishermen, farmers, and recent migrants. The research conducted was determined to gain a consensus of shared knowledge between the subgroups in regard to the changing environment. Along the scale from denial to concerned, it was found that a majority of respondents noticed climate change but believed that humans were not the cause of it. About a third of the respondents were unaware of it, while the rest of the interlocutors were either dismissive of it or somewhat concerned.

One of the cultural models found in this research was that climate change was natural. The respondents interpreted the changes such as rising sea-levels and drought as cycles of nature. They explained them as natural processes in the Earth&#x27;s evolution not affected by humans. They expressed doubt about human induced climate change but acknowledged the changing environment around them. The residents of the Eastern Shore question the legitimacy of the buildup of greenhouse gases from our use of fossil fuels, which cause sea level rise or glacial melting. Part of this hesitation comes from the knowledge passed down through their families and the stories of weather cycles from previous relatives, all who lived in the same area for generations. This concept of nature going through cycles is culturally significant to the groups living in the area.

The respondents also make note that climate change may have been newly identified by scientists but has been a phenomenon that has been with us from the beginning of time and not with the onset of the industrial revolution. This reinforces the belief that climate change is happening, just not because of humans. Therefore, when contemporary theories of climate change challenge respondents’ longstanding traditional cultural models, the latter tends to emerge as the more likely outcome.

The respondents also believe that if climate change becomes apparent to politicians as a human-induced problem, that will lead to regulations being placed on them. They do not believe that climate policies will benefit them and are therefore unlikely to support such programs. They are concerned more with policies and regulations rather than climate change in the area. They see themselves as living with the climate instead of the common approach of overcoming or conquering it. Living with the climate is viewed as nature and society being connected and sharing a relationship where humans must change their activities to fit the changing climate.

Communicating with people who are labeled as skeptics can help create policies that may not be rejected. These beliefs are deeply rooted in longstanding traditions and not influenced by right wing think tanks or other media platforms. Therefore, communicating and working with these people may help reduce the amount of time it will take for policies to be accepted and approved by them. For policy makers to be effective, they should consider the knowledge that these people have and work with them instead of imposing a top-down approach for climate change policy.

==Criticism==
According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, such widespread skeptical doubts have not developed independently, but have been &quot;encouraged by lobbying and PR campaigns financed by the polluting industries&quot;. Supporters of environmentalists argue that &quot;skepticism&quot; implies a form of denialism, and that, in the US particularly, &quot;large donations [have been made] to Senators and Congressmen and [have] sponsored neoliberal think tanks and contrarian scientific research. ExxonMobil, the oil major, has been accused by Friends of the Earth and others of giving millions of dollars to a long list of think-tanks and lobbyists opposed to Kyoto.&quot;

A study from 2008 showed that the overwhelming majority of environmentally skeptical books published since the 1970s were either written or published by authors or institutions affiliated with right-wing think tanks. It concludes that &quot;scepticism is a tactic of an elite-driven counter-movement designed to combat environmentalism, and that the successful use of this tactic has contributed to the weakening of US commitment to environmental protection.&quot;

Peter Jacques wrote, &quot;The skeptical environmental counter-movement is a civic problem and in dealing with the propositions from the counter-movement we are forced to reach down to the bedrock issues of epistemology, identities, articulation and other core work for politics. To use scientism as a hammer against the screw of skepticism will split the wood of public life into splinters or it will immobilize the hammer. Scientism is a modernist tool that will haplessly reshuffle the old excursions - and we all know the &#x27;master&#x27;s tools will not dismantle the master&#x27;s house&quot;

<doc id="10553" wikidata="Q11405" url="?curid=10553" title="Flute">
<text>The flute is a member of a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group. Like all woodwinds, flutes are aerophones, producing sound with a vibrating column of air. Flutes produce sound when the player&#x27;s air flows across an opening. In the Hornbostel–Sachs classification system, flutes are edge-blown aerophones. A musician who plays the flute is called a flautist or flutist.

Paleolithic flutes with hand-bored holes are the earliest known identifiable musical instruments. A number of flutes dating to about 53,000 to 45,000 years ago have been found in the Swabian Jura region of present-day Germany, indicating a developed musical tradition from the earliest period of modern human presence in Europe. While the oldest flutes currently known were found in Europe, Asia also has a long history with the instrument. A playable bone flute discovered in China is dated to about 9,000 years ago. The Americas also had an ancient flute culture, with instruments found in Caral, Peru, dating back 5,000 years and in Labrador dating back about 7,500 years.

The bamboo flute has a long history, especially in China and India. Flutes have been discovered in historical records and artworks starting in the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BC). The oldest written sources reveal the Chinese were using the kuan (a reed instrument) and hsio (or xiao, an end-blown flute, often of bamboo) in the 12th–11th centuries BC, followed by the chi (or ch&#x27;ih) in the 9th century BC and the yüeh in the 8th century BC. Of these, the bamboo chi is the oldest documented transverse flute.

Musicologist Curt Sachs called the cross flute (Sanskrit: vāṃśī) &quot;the outstanding wind instrument of ancient India&quot;, and said that religious artwork depicting &quot;celestial music&quot; instruments was linked to music with an &quot;aristocratic character&quot;. The Indian bamboo cross flute, Bansuri, was sacred to Krishna, who is depicted with the instrument in Hindu art. In India, the cross flute appeared in reliefs from the 1st century AD at Sanchi and Amaravati from the 2nd–4th centuries AD.

According to historian Alexander Buchner, there were flutes in Europe in prehistoric times, but they disappeared from the continent until flutes arrived from Asia by way of &quot;North Africa, Hungary, and Bohemia&quot;. The end-blown flute began to be seen in illustration in the 11th century. Transverse flutes entered Europe through Byzantium and were depicted in Greek art about 800 AD. The transverse flute had spread into Europe by way of Germany, and was known as the German flute.

==Etymology and terminology==
The word &quot;flute&quot; first appeared in the English language during the Middle English period, as &quot;floute&quot;, &quot;flowte&quot;, or &quot;flo(y)te&quot;, possibly from Old French &quot;flaute&quot; and Old Provençal &quot;flaüt&quot;, or possibly from Old French &quot;fleüte&quot;, &quot;flaüte&quot;, &quot;flahute&quot; via Middle High German &quot;floite&quot; or Dutch &quot;fluit&quot;. The English verb &quot;flout&quot; has the same linguistic root, and the modern Dutch verb &quot;fluiten&quot; still shares the two meanings. Attempts to trace the word back to the Latin &quot;flare&quot; (to blow, inflate) have been called &quot;phonologically impossible&quot; or &quot;inadmissable&quot;. The first known use of the word &quot;flute&quot; was in the 14th century. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, this was in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Hous of Fame&quot;, .

A musician who plays any instrument in the flute family can be called a flutist, flautist, or flute player. &quot;Flutist&quot; dates back to at least 1603, the earliest quotation cited by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. &quot;Flautist&quot; was used in 1860 by Nathaniel Hawthorne in &quot;The Marble Faun&quot;, after being adopted during the 18th century from Italy (&quot;flautista&quot;, itself from &quot;flauto&quot;), like many musical terms in England since the Italian Renaissance. Other English terms, now virtually obsolete, are &quot;fluter&quot; (15th–19th centuries) and &quot;flutenist&quot; (17th and 18th centuries).

==History==


A fragment of a juvenile cave bear&#x27;s femur, with two to four holes, was found at Divje Babe in Slovenia and dated to about 43,000 years ago. It may be the oldest flute discovered, but this has been disputed. In 2008, a flute dated to at least 35,000 years ago was discovered in Hohle Fels cave near Ulm, Germany. It is a five-holed flute with a V-shaped mouthpiece and was made from a vulture wing bone. The discovery was published in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, in August 2009. This was the oldest confirmed musical instrument ever found, until a redating of flutes found in Geißenklösterle cave revealed them to be older, at 42,000 to 43,000 years.

The Hohle Fels flute is one of several found in the Hohle Fels cavern next to the Venus of Hohle Fels and a short distance from the oldest known human carving. On announcing the discovery, scientists suggested that the &quot;finds demonstrate the presence of a well-established musical tradition at the time when modern humans colonized Europe&quot;. Scientists have also suggested that this flute&#x27;s discovery may help to explain &quot;the probable behavioural and cognitive gulf between&quot; Neanderthals and early modern human.
An 18.7 cm flute with three holes, made from a mammoth tusk and dated to 30,000–37,000 years ago, was found in 2004 in the Geißenklösterle cave near Ulm, in the southern German Swabian Alb. Two flutes made from swan bones were excavated a decade earlier from the same cave and dated to about 36,000 years ago.

A playable 9,000-year-old Chinese Gudi (literally, &quot;bone flute&quot;) was excavated from a tomb in Jiahu along with 29 similar specimens. They were made from the wing bones of red-crowned cranes and each has five to eight holes.
The earliest extant Chinese transverse flute is a &quot;chi&quot; () flute discovered in the Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng at the Suizhou site, Hubei province, China, dating from 433 BC, during the later Zhou dynasty. It is fashioned of lacquered bamboo with closed ends and has five stops on the flute&#x27;s side instead of the top. &quot;Shi Jing&quot;, traditionally said to have been compiled and edited by Confucius, mentions chi flutes. 

The earliest written reference to a flute is from a Sumerian-language cuneiform tablet dated to c. 2600–2700 BC.
Flutes are mentioned in a recently translated tablet of the Epic of Gilgamesh, an epic poem whose development spanned the period from about 2100–600 BC. A set of cuneiform tablets knows as the &quot;&quot;musical texts&quot; provide precise tuning instructions for seven scales of a stringed instrument (assumed to be a Babylonian lyre). One of those scales is named &quot;embūbum&quot;&quot;, which is an Akkadian word for &quot;flute&quot;.

The Bible, in Genesis 4:21, cites Jubal as being the &quot;father of all those who play the &quot;ugab&quot; and the &quot;kinnor&quot;&quot;. The former Hebrew term is believed by some to refer to a wind instrument, or wind instruments in general, the latter to a stringed instrument, or stringed instruments in general. As such, Jubal is regarded in the Judeo-Christian tradition as the inventor of the flute (a word used in some translations of this biblical passage). In other sections of the Bible (1 Samuel 10:5, 1 Kings 1:40, Isaiah 5:12 and 30:29, and Jeremiah 48:36) the flute is referred to as &quot;chalil&quot;, from the root word for &quot;hollow&quot;. Archeological digs in the Holy Land have discovered flutes from the Bronze Age ( 4000–1200 BC) and the Iron Age (1200–586 BC), the latter era &quot;witness[ing] the creation of the Israelite kingdom and its separation into the two kingdoms of Israel and Judea.&quot;

Some early flutes were made out of tibias (shin bones). The flute has also always been an essential part of Indian culture, and the cross flute believed by several accounts to originate in India as Indian literature from 1500 BC has made vague references to the cross flute.

==Acoustics==

A flute produces sound when a stream of air directed across a hole in the instrument creates a vibration of air at the hole. The airstream creates a Bernoulli or siphon. This excites the air contained in the resonant cavity (usually cylindrical) within the flute. The flutist changes the pitch of the sound produced by opening and closing holes in the body of the instrument, thus changing the effective length of the resonator and its corresponding resonant frequency. By varying the air pressure, a flutist can also change the pitch by causing the air in the flute to resonate at a harmonic rather than the fundamental frequency without opening or closing any of the holes.

Head joint geometry appears particularly critical to acoustic performance and tone, but there is no clear consensus among manufacturers on a particular shape. Acoustic impedance of the embouchure hole appears the most critical parameter. Critical variables affecting this acoustic impedance include: the length of the chimney (the hole between the lip-plate and the head tube), chimney diameter, and radii or curvature of the ends of the chimney and any designed restriction in the &quot;throat&quot; of the instrument, such as that in the Japanese Nohkan flute.

A study in which professional flutists were blindfolded could find no significant differences between flutes made from a variety of metals. In two different sets of blind listening, no flute was correctly identified in a first listening, and in a second, only the silver flute was identified. The study concluded that there was &quot;no evidence that the wall material has any appreciable effect on the sound color or dynamic range&quot;.

== Materials ==
Historically, flutes were most commonly made of reed, bamboo, wood, or other organic materials. They were also made of glass, bone, and nephrite. Most modern flutes are made of metal, primarily silver and nickel. Silver is less common than silver alloys. Other materials used for flutes include gold, platinum, grenadilla and copper.

==Types==
In its most basic form, a flute is an open tube which is blown into. After focused study and training, players use controlled air-direction to create an airstream in which the air is aimed downward into the tone hole of the flute&#x27;s headjoint. There are several broad classes of flutes. With most flutes, the musician blows directly across the edge of the mouthpiece, with 1/4 of their bottom lip covering the embouchure hole. However, some flutes, such as the whistle, gemshorn, flageolet, recorder, tin whistle, tonette, fujara, and ocarina have a duct that directs the air onto the edge (an arrangement that is termed a &quot;fipple&quot;). These are known as fipple flutes. The fipple gives the instrument a distinct timbre which is different from non-fipple flutes and makes the instrument easier to play, but takes a degree of control away from the musician.

Another division is between side-blown (or transverse) flutes, such as the Western concert flute, piccolo, fife, dizi and bansuri; and end-blown flutes, such as the ney, xiao, kaval, danso, shakuhachi, Anasazi flute and quena. The player of a side-blown flute uses a hole on the side of the tube to produce a tone, instead of blowing on an end of the tube. End-blown flutes should not be confused with fipple flutes such as the recorder, which are also played vertically but have an internal duct to direct the air flow across the edge of the tone hole.

Flutes may be open at one or both ends. The ocarina, xun, pan pipes, police whistle, and bosun&#x27;s whistle are closed-ended. Open-ended flutes such as the concert flute and the recorder have more harmonics, and thus more flexibility for the player, and brighter timbres. An organ pipe may be either open or closed, depending on the sound desired.

Flutes may have any number of pipes or tubes, though one is the most common number. Flutes with multiple resonators may be played one resonator at a time (as is typical with pan pipes) or more than one at a time (as is typical with double flutes).

Flutes can be played with several different air sources. Conventional flutes are blown with the mouth, although some cultures use nose flutes. The flue pipes of organs, which are acoustically similar to duct flutes, are blown by bellows or fans.

===Western transverse===

====Wooden one-keyed====
Usually in D, wooden transverse flutes were played in European classical music mainly in the period from the early 18th century to the early 19th century. As such, the instrument is often indicated as baroque flute. Gradually marginalized by the Western concert flute in the 19th century, baroque flutes were again played from the late 20th century as part of the historically informed performance practice.

====Concert====

The Western concert flute, a descendant of the medieval German flute, is a transverse treble flute that is closed at the top. An &quot;embouchure hole&quot; is positioned near the top, and the flutist blows across it. The flute has circular tone holes larger than the finger holes of its baroque predecessors. The size and placement of tone holes, key mechanism, and fingering system used to produce the notes in the flute&#x27;s range were evolved from 1832 to 1847 by Theobald Boehm, who helped greatly improve the instrument&#x27;s dynamic range and intonation over its predecessors. With some refinements (and the rare exception of the Kingma system and other custom adapted fingering systems), Western concert flutes typically conform to Boehm&#x27;s design, known as the Boehm system. Beginner&#x27;s flutes are made of nickel, silver, or brass that is silver-plated, while professionals use solid silver, gold, and sometimes even platinum flutes. There are also modern wooden-bodied flutes usually with silver or gold keywork. The wood is usually African Blackwood.

The standard concert flute is pitched in C and has a range of three octaves starting from middle C or one half step lower when a B foot is attached. This means that the concert flute is one of the highest-pitched common orchestra and concert band instruments.
====Concert variants====

The piccolo plays an octave higher than the regular treble flute. Lower members of the flute family include the G alto and C bass flutes that are used occasionally, and are pitched a perfect fourth and an octave below the concert flute, respectively. The contra-alto, contrabass, subcontrabass, double contrabass, and hyperbass flutes are other rare forms of the flute pitched up to four octaves below middle C.

Other sizes of flutes and piccolos are used from time to time. A rarer instrument of the modern pitching system is the G treble flute. Instruments made according to an older pitch standard, used principally in wind-band music, include D piccolo, E soprano flute (Keyed a minor 3rd above the standard C flute), F alto flute, and B bass flute.

===Indian===

The bamboo flute is an important instrument in Indian classical music, and developed independently of the Western flute. The Hindu God Lord Krishna is traditionally considered a master of the bamboo flute. The Indian flutes are very simple compared to the Western counterparts; they are made of bamboo and are keyless.

Two main varieties of Indian flutes are currently used. The first, the Bansuri (बांसुरी), has six finger holes and one embouchure hole, and is used predominantly in the Hindustani music of Northern India. The second, the Venu or Pullanguzhal, has eight finger holes, and is played predominantly in the Carnatic music of Southern India. Presently, the eight-holed flute with cross-fingering technique is common among many Carnatic flutists. Prior to this, the South Indian flute had only seven finger holes, with the fingering standard developed by Sharaba Shastri, of the Palladam school, at the beginning of the 20th century.

The quality of the flute&#x27;s sound depends somewhat on the specific bamboo used to make it, and it is generally agreed that the best bamboo grows in the Nagercoil area of South India.

In 1998 Bharata Natya Shastra Sarana Chatushtai, Avinash Balkrishna Patwardhan developed a methodology to produce perfectly tuned flutes for the ten &#x27;thatas&#x27; currently present in Indian Classical Music.

In a regional dialect of Gujarati, a flute is also called Pavo. Some people can also play pair of flutes (Jodiyo Pavo) simultaneously.

===Chinese===

In China there are many varieties of dizi (笛子), or Chinese flute, with different sizes, structures (with or without a resonance membrane) and number of holes (from 6 to 11) and intonations (different keys). Most are made of bamboo, but can come in wood, jade, bone, and iron. One peculiar feature of the Chinese flute is the use of a resonance membrane mounted on one of the holes that vibrates with the air column inside the tube. This membrane is called a &quot;di mo&quot;, which is usually a thin tissue paper. It gives the flute a bright sound.

Commonly seen flutes in the modern Chinese orchestra are the bangdi (梆笛), qudi (曲笛), xindi (新笛), and dadi (大笛). The bamboo flute played vertically is called the xiao (簫), which is a different category of wind instrument in China.

=== Korean ===

The Korean flute, called the daegeum, 대금, is a large bamboo transverse flute used in traditional Korean music. It has a buzzing membrane that gives it a unique timbre.

===Japanese===
The Japanese flute, called the fue, (hiragana: ), encompasses a large number of musical flutes from Japan, include the end-blown shakuhachi and hotchiku, as well as the transverse gakubue, komabue, ryūteki, nōkan, shinobue, kagurabue and minteki.

===Sodina and suling===
The sodina is an end-blown flute found throughout the island state of Madagascar, located in the Indian Ocean off southeastern Africa. One of the oldest instruments on the island, it bears close resemblance to end-blown flutes found in Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia, where it is known as the &quot;suling&quot;, suggesting the predecessor to the sodina was carried to Madagascar in outrigger canoes by the island&#x27;s original settlers emigrating from Borneo. An image of the most celebrated contemporary sodina flutist, Rakoto Frah (d. 2001), was featured on the local currency.

===Sring===
The sring (also called &quot;blul&quot;) is a relatively small, end-blown flute with a nasal tone quality found in the Caucasus region of Eastern Armenia. It is made of wood or cane, usually with seven finger holes and one thumb hole, producing a diatonic scale. One Armenian musicologist believes the sring to be the most characteristic of national Armenian instruments.

===Ọjà===

The Ọjà is a traditional musical instrument utilized by the Igbo people, who are indigenous to Nigeria. The ọjà (flute) is used during cultural activities or events where Igbo music is played. It is skillfully carved from wood/bamboo or metal and is played by blowing air into one end while covering and uncovering holes along the body to create different notes.

==Breathing techniques==
There are several means by which flautists breathe to blow air through the instrument and produce sound. They include diaphragmatic breathing and circular breathing. Diaphragmatic breathing optimizes inhalation, minimizing the number of breaths. Circular breathing brings air in through the nose and out through the mouth, enabling a continuous sound.

<doc id="10568" wikidata="Q2736" url="?curid=10568" title="Association football">
<text>Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each, who almost exclusively use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world&#x27;s most popular sport.

The game of association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886. The game is played with a football that is in circumference. The two teams compete to score goals by getting the ball into the other team&#x27;s goal (between the posts, under the bar, and fully across the goal line). When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may also use any other part of their body, such as their head, chest, and thighs, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball. Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and that only within the penalty area. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner. There are situations where a goal can be disallowed, such as an offside call or a foul in the build-up to the goal. Depending on the format of the competition, an equal number of goals scored may result in a draw being declared with 1 point awarded to each team, or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shoot-out.

Internationally, association football is governed by FIFA. Under FIFA, there are six continental confederations: AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC, and UEFA. Of these confederations, CONMEBOL is the oldest one, being founded in 1916. National associations (e.g. the FA in England) are responsible for managing the game in their own countries both professionally and at an amateur level, and coordinating competitions in accordance with the Laws of the Game. 

The most prestigious senior international competition is the FIFA World Cup. The men&#x27;s World Cup is the most-viewed sporting event in the world, surpassing the Olympic Games. The two most prestigious competitions in club football are the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League, which attract an extensive television audience worldwide. The final of the men&#x27;s tournament is the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.

== Name ==

Association football is one of a family of football codes that emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity. Within the English-speaking world, the sport is now usually called &quot;football&quot; in Great Britain and most of Ulster in the north of Ireland, whereas people usually call it &quot;soccer&quot; in regions and countries where other codes of football are prevalent, such as Australia, Canada, South Africa, most of Ireland (excluding Ulster), and the United States. A notable exception is New Zealand, where in the first two decades of the 21st century, under the influence of international television, &quot;football&quot; has been gaining prevalence, despite the dominance of other codes of football, namely rugby union and rugby league.

The term &quot;soccer&quot; comes from Oxford &quot;-er&quot; slang, which was prevalent at the University of Oxford in England from about 1875, and is thought to have been borrowed from the slang of Rugby School. Initially spelt &quot;assoccer&quot; (a shortening of &quot;association&quot;), it was later reduced to the modern spelling. This form of slang also gave rise to &quot;rugger&quot; for rugby football, &quot;fiver&quot; and &quot;tenner&quot; for five pound and ten pound notes, and the now-archaic &quot;footer&quot; that was also a name for association football. The word &quot;soccer&quot; arrived at its current form in 1895 and was first recorded in 1889 in the earlier form of &quot;socca&quot;.

== History ==


Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures. The Chinese competitive game &quot;&quot; (, literally &quot;kickball&quot;; also known as &quot;tsu chu&quot;) resembles modern association football as well as a mix of basketball, and volleyball.
 This is the earliest form of a kicking game for which there is historical evidence. The game was first recorded as in exercise in the Zhan Guo Ce, a military history from the Han dynasty. &#x27; players would pass the ball around, having to avoid it touching the ground at any point. It was then passed to a designated player, who attempted to kick it through the &quot;fengliu yan&quot;, a circular goal atop 10–11 meter poles. During the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), &#x27; games were standardised and rules were established. The Silk Road facilitated the transmission of &quot;cuju&quot; outside of China, especially the form of the game popular in the Tang dynasty, the period when the inflatable ball was invented and replaced the stuffed ball. Other East Asian games include &#x27; in Japan and &#x27; in Korea, both influenced by &quot;cuju&quot;. &quot;&quot; originated after the year 600 during the Asuka period. It was a ceremonial rather than a competitive game, and involved the kicking of a &quot;mari&quot;, a ball made of animal skin. In North America, was a ball game played by the Algonquians; it was described as &quot;almost identical to the kind of folk football being played in Europe at the same time, in which the ball was kicked through goals&quot;.

&#x27; and &#x27; were Greek ball games. An image of an &#x27; player depicted in low relief on a stele of in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens appears on the UEFA European Championship trophy. Athenaeus, writing in 228 CE, mentions the Roman ball game &#x27;. &#x27; and &#x27; were played involving hands and violence. They all appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling, and volleyball more than what is recognisable as modern football. As with pre-codified mob football, the antecedent of all modern football codes, these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking it.

Association football in itself does not have a classical history. Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world, FIFA has described that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe. The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century. The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England.
The Cambridge rules, first drawn up at the University of Cambridge in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857, which led to the formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.

These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons&#x27; Tavern in Great Queen Street, London. The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse. The Freemasons&#x27; Tavern was the setting for five more meetings of The FA between October and December 1863; the English FA eventually issued the first comprehensive set of rules named , forming modern football. The laws included bans on running with the ball in hand and hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Eleven clubs, under the charge of FA secretary Ebenezer Cobb Morley, ratified the original thirteen laws of the game. The sticking point was hacking, which a twelfth club at the meeting, Blackheath FC, had wanted to keep, resulting in them withdrawing from the FA. Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA, and instead in 1871, along with Blackheath, formed the Rugby Football Union. The FA rules included handling of the ball by &quot;marks&quot; and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules football being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s, with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.

The world&#x27;s oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by the footballer and cricketer Charles W. Alcock, and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The first official international football match also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in Glasgow, again at the instigation of Alcock. England is also home to the world&#x27;s first football league, which was founded in Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor. The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and Northern England.

Laws of the Game are determined by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). The board was formed in 1886 after a meeting in Manchester of the Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales, and the Irish Football Association. FIFA, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to the Laws of the Game of the Football Association. The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the IFAB in 1913. The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.

For most of the 20th century, Europe and South America were the dominant regions in association football. The FIFA World Cup, inaugurated in 1930, became the main stage for players of both continents to show their worth and the strength of their national teams. In the second half of the century, the European Cup and the Copa Libertadores were created, and the champions of these two club competitions would contest the Intercontinental Cup to prove which team was the best in the world.

In the 21st century, South America has continued to produce some of the best footballers in the world, but its clubs have fallen behind the still dominant European clubs, which often sign the best players from Latin America and elsewhere. Meanwhile, football has improved in Africa, Asia and North America, and nowadays, these regions are at least on equal grounds with South America in club football, although countries in the Caribbean and Oceania regions (except Australia) have yet to make a mark in international football. When it comes to men&#x27;s national teams, Europeans and South Americans continue to dominate the FIFA World Cup, as no team from any other region has managed to even reach the final. These regional trends do not hold true for the women&#x27;s game, as the United States women&#x27;s national team has won the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup four times, more than any other women&#x27;s team.

Football is played at a professional level all over the world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams, while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet. A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football. Football has the highest global television audience in sport.

In many parts of the world, football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans, local communities, and even nations. Ryszard Kapuściński says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games. The Ivory Coast national football team helped secure a truce to the nation&#x27;s civil war in 2006 and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouaké, an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time. By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras. The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.

=== Women&#x27;s association football ===
Women&#x27;s association football has historically seen opposition, with national associations severely curbing its development and several outlawing it completely. Women may have been playing football for as long as the game has existed. Evidence shows that a similar ancient game (&quot;cuju&quot;, or &quot;tsu chu&quot;) was played by women during the Han dynasty (25–220 CE), as female figures are depicted in frescoes of the period playing &quot;tsu chu&quot;. There are also reports of annual football matches played by women in Midlothian, Scotland, during the 1790s.
Association football, the modern game, has documented early involvement of women. In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit violence on the pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play. The first match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in 1892 in Glasgow. In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895. Women&#x27;s football has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom.

Association football continued to be played by women since the time of the first recorded women&#x27;s games in the late 19th century. The best-documented early European team was founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies&#x27; Football Club. Honeyball is quoted as, &quot;I founded the association late last year [1894], with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the &#x27;ornamental and useless&#x27; creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most.&quot; Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women&#x27;s football. However, the women&#x27;s game was frowned upon by the British football associations and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the &quot;masculinity&quot; of the game.

Women&#x27;s football became popular on a large scale at the time of the First World War, when female employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men 50 years earlier. The most successful team of the era was Dick, Kerr Ladies F.C. of Preston, England. The team played in one of the first women&#x27;s international matches against a French XI team in 1920, and also made up most of the England team against a Scottish Ladies XI in the same year, winning 22–0.

Despite being more popular than some men&#x27;s football events, with one match seeing a 53,000 strong crowd in 1920, women&#x27;s football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on association members&#x27; pitches, stating that &quot;the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged.&quot; Players and football writers have argued that this ban was, in fact, due to envy of the large crowds that women&#x27;s matches attracted, and because the FA had no control over the money made from the women&#x27;s game. The FA ban led to the formation of the short-lived English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds. Women&#x27;s football also faced bans in several other countries, notably in Brazil from 1941 to 1979, in France from 1941 to 1970, and in Germany from 1955 to 1970.

Restrictions began to be reduced in the 1960s and 1970s. The Italian women&#x27;s football league was established in 1968. In December 1969, the Women&#x27;s Football Association was formed in England, with the sport eventually becoming the most prominent team sport for women in the United Kingdom. Two unofficial women&#x27;s World Cups were organised by the FIEFF in 1970 and in 1971. Also in 1971, UEFA members voted to officially recognise women&#x27;s football, while The Football Association rescinded the ban that prohibited women from playing on association members&#x27; pitches in England.

Women&#x27;s football still faces many struggles, but its worldwide growth has seen major competitions being launched at both the national and international levels, mirroring the men&#x27;s competitions. The FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup was inaugurated in 1991: the first tournament was held in China, featuring 12 teams from the respective six confederations. The World Cup has been held every four years since; by 2019, it had expanded to 24 national teams, and 1.12 billion viewers watched the competition. Four years later, FIFA targeted the 32-team 2023 Women&#x27;s World Cup at an audience of 2 billion, while about 1.4 million tickets were sold, setting a Women&#x27;s World Cup record. Women&#x27;s football has been an Olympic event since 1996.

North America is the dominant region in women&#x27;s football, with the United States winning the most FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cups and Olympic tournaments. Europe and Asia come second and third in terms of international success, and the women&#x27;s game has been improving in South America.

== Gameplay ==
Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the . The game is played using a spherical ball of circumference, known as the &quot;football&quot; (or &quot;soccer ball&quot;). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team&#x27;s goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss before kick-off or penalty kicks.

The primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a throw-in restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around, they may use any part of their body (notably, &quot;heading&quot; with the forehead) other than their hands or arms. Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though players may not pass to teammates who are in an offside position.

During gameplay, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.
At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the 2022–23 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.85 goals per match. The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, but a number of specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper.

These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends the most time. For example, there are central defenders and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team&#x27;s play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of a team&#x27;s players is known as a &quot;formation&quot;. Defining the team&#x27;s formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team&#x27;s manager.

== Laws ==

There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulations and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football for both sexes, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the IFAB. In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of association football. Within the United States, Major League Soccer used a distinct ruleset during the 1990s and the National Federation of State High School Associations and NCAA still use rulesets that are comparable to, but different from, the IFAB Laws.

=== Players, equipment, and officials ===
Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.

The basic equipment or &quot;kit&quot; players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards. An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals. Headgear is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury. Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.

A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is five in 90 minutes, with each team being allowed one more if the game should go into extra-time; the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches. Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or timewasting at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match. IFAB recommends &quot;that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team&quot;. Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations.
A game is officiated by a referee, who has &quot;full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed&quot; (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two assistant referees. In many high-level games there is also a fourth official who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.

Goal line technology is used to measure if the whole ball has crossed the goal-line thereby determining whether a goal has been scored or not; this was brought in to prevent controversy. Video assistant referees (VAR) have also been increasingly introduced in high-level matches to assist officials through video replays to correct clear and obvious mistakes. There are four types of calls that can be reviewed: mistaken identity in awarding a red or yellow card, goals and whether there was a violation during the buildup, direct red card decisions, and penalty decisions.

=== Ball ===
The ball is spherical with a circumference of between , a weight in the range of , and a pressure between at sea level. In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurisation, but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic.

=== Pitch ===
As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.

The length of the pitch, or field, for international adult matches is in the range of and the width is in the range of . Fields for non-international matches may be in length and in width, provided the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of long and wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches; however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.

The longer boundary lines are &quot;touchlines&quot;, while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are &quot;goal lines&quot;. A rectangular goal is positioned on each goal line, midway between the two touchlines. The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.

In front of the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line from the goalposts and extending into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.

=== Duration and tie-breaking methods ===

==== 90-minute ordinary time ====
A standard adult football match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called &quot;additional time&quot; in FIFA documents, but is most commonly referred to as &quot;stoppage time&quot; or &quot;injury time&quot;, while &quot;lost time&quot; can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. Stoppage time does not fully compensate for the time in which the ball is out of play, and a 90-minute game typically involves about an hour of &quot;effective playing time&quot;. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, towards the end of the half, the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time they intend to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1–0 with two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty kick. Villa&#x27;s goalkeeper deliberately kicked the ball far out of play; by the time it was recovered, the clock had run out and the game was over, leaving Stoke unable to attempt the penalty. The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until a penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed; thus, no game can end with an uncompleted penalty.

==== Tie-breaking ====
In league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required, various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock; some competitions may invoke replays. A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of penalty shoot-outs (known officially in the Laws of the Game as &quot;kicks from the penalty mark&quot;) to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament or be the champion. Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament, with goals scored in a penalty shoot-out not making up part of the final score.

In competitions using two-legged matches, each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shoot-out are required.

=== Ball in and out of play ===
Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are &quot;ball in play&quot; and &quot;ball out of play&quot;. From the beginning of each playing period with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:

* Kick-off: following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play.
* Throw-in: when the ball has crossed the touchline; awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball.
* Goal kick: when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the attacking team; awarded to defending team.
* Corner kick: when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the defending team; awarded to attacking team.
* Indirect free kick: awarded to the opposing team following &quot;non-penal&quot; fouls, certain technical infringements, or when play is stopped to caution or dismiss an opponent without a specific foul having occurred. A goal may not be scored directly (without the ball first touching another player) from an indirect free kick.
* Direct free kick: awarded to fouled team following certain listed &quot;penal&quot; fouls. A goal may be scored directly from a direct free kick.
* Penalty kick: awarded to the fouled team following a foul usually punishable by a direct free kick but that has occurred within their opponent&#x27;s penalty area.
* Dropped-ball: occurs when the referee has stopped play for any other reason, such as a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective.

=== Misconduct ===
==== On-field ====

A foul occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of &quot;penal fouls&quot;, punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick.

The referee may punish a player&#x27;s or substitute&#x27;s misconduct by a caution (yellow card) or dismissal (red card). A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, which results in a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been &quot;booked&quot;, the referee writing the player&#x27;s name in their official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player may not participate in further play. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of &quot;unsporting behaviour&quot; may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute, substituted player, and to non-players such as managers and support staff.

Rather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as &quot;playing an advantage&quot;. The referee may &quot;call back&quot; play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within &quot;a few seconds&quot;. Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.

The referee&#x27;s decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final. The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including awards/non-awards of goals) were incorrect.

==== Off-field ====

Along with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs&#x27; financial management, doping, age fraud and match fixing. Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game. Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card. Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.

Sanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, point deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the English Football League deduct 12 points from any team that enters financial administration. Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win.

== Governing bodies ==
The recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as futsal and beach soccer) is FIFA. The FIFA headquarters are located in Zürich, Switzerland. Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are:
* Asia: Asian Football Confederation (AFC)
* Africa: Confederation of African Football (CAF)
* Europe: Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)
* North/Central America &amp; Caribbean: Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF)
* Oceania: Oceania Football Confederation (OFC)
* South America: Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol (South American Football Confederation; CONMEBOL)

National associations (or national federations) oversee football within individual countries. These are generally synonymous with sovereign states (for example, the Cameroonian Football Federation in Cameroon), but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example, the Scottish Football Association in Scotland). 211 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations. Other national associations may be members of continental confederations but otherwise not participate in FIFA competitions.

While FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the IFAB, where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes.

== International competitions ==
International competitions in association football principally consist of two varieties: competitions involving representative national teams or those involving clubs based in multiple nations and national leagues. &quot;International football&quot;, without qualification, most often refers to the former. In the case of international club competition, it is the country of origin of the clubs involved, not the nationalities of their players, that renders the competition international in nature.

The major international competition in football and the most prestigious is the World Cup, organised by FIFA. This competition has taken place every four years since 1930, with the exception of the 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were cancelled because of World War II. As of 2022, over 200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament involved 32 national teams (expanding to 48 teams for the 2026 tournament) competing over a four-week period. The World Cup is the world&#x27;s most widely viewed and most followed sporting event, with the 2022 tournament estimated to be watched by 5 billion people, more than 60% of the global population. The 1958 World Cup saw the emergence of Pelé as a global sporting star, a period that coincided with &quot;the explosive spread of television, which massively amplified his presence everywhere&quot;. The current champions are Argentina, who won their third title at the 2022 tournament in Qatar. The FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup has been held every four years since 1991. Under the tournament&#x27;s current format that was expanded in 2023, national teams vie for 31 slots in a three-year qualification phase, while the host nation&#x27;s team enters automatically as the 32nd slot. The current champions are Spain, after winning their first title in the 2023 tournament.

There has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles when FIFA and the International Olympic Committee had disagreed over the status of amateur players. Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) were the most prestigious international event. Originally, the tournament was for amateurs only. As professionalism spread around the world, the gap in quality between the World Cup and the Olympics widened. The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. Between 1948 and 1980, 23 out of 27 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only Sweden (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), Denmark (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and Japan (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance. For the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the IOC allowed professional players to compete. Since 1992, male competitors must be under 23 years old, although since 1996, three players over the age of 23 have been allowed per squad. A women&#x27;s tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men&#x27;s event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women&#x27;s Olympic tournament.
After the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the European Championship (UEFA), the Copa América (CONMEBOL), the Africa Cup of Nations (CAF), the Asian Cup (AFC), the Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the Nations Cup (OFC). These competitions are not strictly limited to members of the continental confederations, with guest teams from other continents sometimes invited to compete. The FIFA Confederations Cup was contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current FIFA World Cup champions, and the country which was hosting the next World Cup. This was generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and did not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself. The tournament was discontinued following the 2017 edition with its calendar slot replaced by an expanded FIFA Club World Cup. The UEFA Nations League and the CONCACAF Nations League were introduced in the late 2010s to replace international friendlies during the two-year cycle between major tournaments.

The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example, the UEFA Champions League in Europe and the Copa Libertadores in South America. The winners of each continental competition contest the FIFA Intercontinental Cup, held annually, and the FIFA Club World Cup, held once every four years.

== Domestic competitions ==

The governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season, normally comprising several divisions, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into tables, placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a round-robin tournament. At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division.

The teams finishing at the top of a country&#x27;s league may also be eligible to play in international club competitions in the following season. The main exceptions to this system occur in some Latin American leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named Apertura and Clausura (Spanish for &quot;Opening&quot; and &quot;Closing&quot;), awarding a champion for each. Most countries supplement the league system with one or more &quot;cup&quot; competitions organised on a knock-out basis. These include the domestic cup, which may be open to all eligible teams in a country&#x27;s league system—both professional and amateur—and is organised by the national federation.

Some countries&#x27; top divisions feature highly-paid star players; in smaller countries, lower divisions, and many women&#x27;s clubs, players may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs. The five top European leagues – Premier League (England), Bundesliga (Germany), La Liga (Spain), Serie A (Italy), and Ligue 1 (France) – attract most of the world&#x27;s best players and, during the 2006–07 season, each of these leagues had a total wage cost in excess of €600 million. These leagues also generated a combined €17.2 billion in revenue in the 2021–22 season from television contracts, matchday tickets, sponsorships, and other sources.

== Variants and casual play ==
Variants of football have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. five-a-side football) play in non-field environments (i.e. beach soccer, indoor soccer, and futsal) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. paralympic association football).

Street football can be played with only minimal equipment – a basic game can be played on almost any open area of reasonable size with just a ball and items to mark the positions of two sets of goalposts. Such games can have team sizes that vary from eleven-a-side, can use a limited or modified subset of the official rules, and can be self-officiated by the players.

<text>The Fox Film Corporation (also known as Fox Studios) was an American independent company that produced motion pictures and was formed in 1915 by the theater &quot;chain&quot; pioneer William Fox. It was the corporate successor to his earlier Greater New York Film Rental Company and Box Office Attraction Company (founded 1913).

The company&#x27;s first film studios were set up in Fort Lee, New Jersey, but in 1917, William Fox sent Sol M. Wurtzel to Hollywood, California to oversee the studio&#x27;s new West Coast production facilities, where the climate was more hospitable for filmmaking. On July 23, 1926, Fox Studios bought the patents of the Movietone sound system for recording sound onto film.

After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, William Fox lost control of the company in 1930, during a hostile takeover. Under new president Sidney R. Kent, the new owners merged the company with Twentieth Century Pictures to form 20th Century-Fox in 1935.

==History==

===Background===

William Fox entered the film industry in 1904 when he purchased a one-third share of a Brooklyn nickelodeon for $1,667. He reinvested his profits from that initial location, expanding to fifteen similar venues in the city, and purchasing prints from the major studios of the time: Biograph, Essanay, Kalem, Lubin, Pathé, Selig, and Vitagraph. After experiencing further success presenting live vaudeville routines along with motion pictures, he expanded into larger venues beginning with his purchase of the disused Gaiety theater, and continuing with acquisitions throughout New York City and New Jersey, including the Academy of Music.

Fox invested further in the film industry by founding the Greater New York Film Rental Company as a film distributor. The major film studios responded by forming the Motion Picture Patents Company in 1908 and the General Film Company in 1910, in an effort to create a monopoly on the creation and distribution of motion pictures. Fox refused to sell out to the monopoly, and sued under the Sherman Antitrust Act, eventually receiving a $370,000 settlement, and ending restrictions on the length of films and the prices that could be paid for screenplays.

In 1914, reflecting the broader scope of his business, he renamed it the Box Office Attraction Company He entered into a contract with the Balboa Amusement Producing Company film studio, purchasing all of their films for showing in his New York area theaters and renting the prints to other exhibitors nationwide. He also continued to distribute material from other sources, such as Winsor McCay&#x27;s early animated film &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot;. Later that year, Fox concluded that it was unwise to be so dependent on other companies, so he purchased the Éclair studio facilities in Fort Lee, New Jersey, along with property in Staten Island, and arranged for actors and crew. The company became a film studio, using the name Box Office Attraction Company; its first release was &quot;Life&#x27;s Shop Window&quot;.

===Fox Film Corporation===
Always more of an entrepreneur than a showman, Fox concentrated on acquiring and building theaters; pictures were secondary. The company&#x27;s first film studios were set up in Fort Lee where it and many other early film studios in America&#x27;s first motion picture industry were based at the beginning of the 20th century.

That same year, in 1914, Fox Film began making motion pictures in California, and in 1915 decided to build its own permanent studio. The company leased the Los Angeles Edendale studio of the Selig Polyscope Company until its own studio, located at Western Avenue and Sunset Boulevard, was completed in 1916. In 1917, William Fox sent Sol M. Wurtzel to Hollywood to oversee the studio&#x27;s West Coast production facilities where a more hospitable and cost-effective climate existed for filmmaking. Between 1915 and 1919, Fox Films earned millions of dollars through films featuring Theda Bara, known as &quot;The Vamp&quot; due to her unique ability to display exoticism. Fox also produced 85 films featuring lead Western actor Tom Mix, who joined Fox in 1917. The popularity of Mix&#x27;s Western films earned Fox large sums of money, and he eventually was paid $17,000 per week.

With the introduction of sound technology, Fox moved to acquire the rights to a sound-on-film process. In the years 1925–26, Fox purchased the rights to the work of Freeman Harrison Owens, the U.S. rights to the Tri-Ergon system invented by three German inventors, and the work of Theodore Case. This resulted in the Movietone sound system later known as &quot;Fox Movietone&quot; developed at the Movietone Studio. Later that year, the company began offering films with a music-and-effects track, and the following year Fox began the weekly &quot;Fox Movietone News&quot; feature, that ran until 1963. The growing company needed space, and in 1926 Fox acquired 300 acres (1.2 km2) in the open country west of Beverly Hills and built &quot;Movietone City&quot;, the best-equipped studio of its time.

Because William Fox opted to remain in New York, much of the Hollywood filmmaking at the Fox Film Corporation was instead managed by Fox&#x27;s movie makers. Janet Gaynor would also become one of the company&#x27;s most prominent stars by the late 1920s.

===Decline===
When rival Marcus Loew died in 1927, Fox offered to buy the Loew family&#x27;s holdings. Loew&#x27;s Inc. controlled more than 200 theaters, as well as the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio. The Loew family agreed to the sale, and the merger of Fox and Loew&#x27;s Inc. was announced in 1929; MGM studio bosses Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg were not included in the deal, and fought back. Using powerful political connections, Mayer called upon the Justice Department&#x27;s antitrust unit to delay giving final approval to the merger. William Fox was badly injured in a car crash in the summer of 1929, and by the time he recovered, he had lost most of his fortune in the stock market crash of 1929, ending any chance of the Fox/Loew&#x27;s merger being approved, even without the Justice Department&#x27;s objections.

Overextended and close to bankruptcy, Fox was stripped of his empire in 1930 and later ended up in jail on bribery and perjury charges. Fox Film, with more than 500 theatres, was placed in receivership. A bank-mandated reorganization propped the company up for a time, but it soon became apparent that despite its size, Fox could not stand on its own. William Fox resented the way he was forced out of his company and portrayed it as an active conspiracy against him in the 1933 book &quot;Upton Sinclair Presents William Fox&quot;.

===Merger===

Under new president Sidney Kent, the new owners began negotiating with the upstart, but powerful independent Twentieth Century Pictures in the early spring of 1935. Twentieth Century had begun in the Samuel Goldwyn Studios in 1932 under founders Joseph Schenck and Darryl F. Zanuck. 
The two companies merged that spring of 1935 and became 20th Century-Fox. The company was purchased by News Corporation in 1985, becoming &quot;20th Century Fox&quot; without the hyphen, and in 2020 was purchased by The Walt Disney Company and renamed 20th Century Studios. For many years, 20th Century-Fox claimed to have been founded in 1915; for instance, it marked 1945 as its 30th anniversary. However, in recent years it has claimed the 1935 merger as its founding, marking its 75th rather than 95th anniversary in 2010.

==Products==

===Feature films===
A 1937 fire in a Fox film storage facility destroyed over 40,000 reels of negatives and prints, including the best-quality copies of every Fox feature produced prior to 1932; although copies located elsewhere allowed many to survive in some form, over 75% of Fox&#x27;s feature films from before 1930 are completely lost.

===Newsreels===

In 1919, Fox began a series of silent newsreels, competing with existing series such as &quot;Hearst Metrotone News&quot;, &quot;International Newsreel&quot;, and &quot;Pathé News&quot;. &quot;Fox News&quot; premiered on October 11, 1919, with subsequent issues released on the Wednesday and Sunday of each week. &quot;Fox News&quot; gained an advantage over its more established competitors when President Woodrow Wilson endorsed the newsreel in a letter, in what may have been the first time an American president commented on a film. In subsequent years, &quot;Fox News&quot; remained one of the major names in the newsreel industry by providing often-exclusive coverage of major international events, including reporting on Pancho Villa, the airship &quot;Roma&quot;, the Ku Klux Klan, and a 1922 eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The silent newsreel series continued until 1930.

In 1926, a subsidiary, Fox Movietone Corporation, was created, tasked with producing newsreels using Fox&#x27;s recently acquired sound-on-film technology. The first of these newsreels debuted on January 21, 1927. Four months later, the May 25 release of a sound recording of Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s departure on his transatlantic flight was described by film historian Raymond Fielding as the &quot;first sound news film of consequence&quot;. &quot;Movietone News&quot; was launched as a regular newsreel feature December 3 of that year. Production of the series continued after the merger with Twentieth Century Pictures, until 1963, and continued to serve 20th Century Fox after that, as a source for film industry stock footage.

Unlike Fox&#x27;s early feature films, the &quot;Fox News&quot; and &quot;Fox Movietone News&quot; libraries have largely survived. The earlier series and some parts of its sound successor are now held by the University of South Carolina, with the remaining &quot;Fox Movietone News&quot; still held by the company.

===Serials===
Fox Film briefly experimented with serial films, releasing the 15-episode &quot;Bride 13&quot; and the 20-episode &quot;Fantômas&quot; in 1920. William Fox was unwilling to compromise on production quality in order to make serials profitable, however, and none were produced subsequently.

===Short films===
Hundreds of one- and two-reel short films of various types were also produced by Fox. Beginning in 1916, the Sunshine Comedy division created two-reel comedy shorts. Many of these, beginning with 1917&#x27;s &quot;Roaring Lions and Wedding Bliss&quot;, starring Lloyd Hamilton, were slapstick, intended to compete with Mack Sennett&#x27;s popular offerings. Sunshine releases continued until the introduction of sound. Other short film series included &quot;Imperial Comedies&quot;, &quot;Van Bibber Comedies&quot; (with Earle Foxe), &quot;O&#x27;Henry&quot;, &quot;Married Life of Helen and Warren&quot;, and &quot;Fox Varieties&quot;. Fox&#x27;s expansion into Spanish-language films in the early 1930s also included shorts.

<text>First National Pictures was an American motion picture production and distribution company. It was founded in 1917 as First National Exhibitors&#x27; Circuit, Inc., an association of independent theatre owners in the United States, and became the country&#x27;s largest theater chain. Expanding from exhibiting movies to distributing them, the company reincorporated in 1919 as &quot;Associated First National Theatres, Inc.&quot; and &quot;Associated First National Pictures, Inc.&quot; In 1924 it expanded to become a motion picture production company as &quot;First National Pictures, Inc.&quot;, and became an important studio in the film industry. In September 1928, control of First National passed to Warner Bros., into which it was completely absorbed on November 4, 1929. A number of Warner Bros. films were thereafter branded First National Pictures until July 1936, when First National Pictures, Inc., was dissolved.
== Early history ==
The First National Exhibitors&#x27; Circuit was founded in 1917 by the merger of 26 of the biggest first-run cinema chains in the United States. It eventually controlled over 600 cinemas, more than 200 of them first-run houses (as opposed to the less lucrative second-run or neighbourhood theatres to which films moved when their initial box office receipts dwindled).

First National was the brainchild of Thomas L. Tally, who was reacting to the overwhelming influence of Paramount Pictures, which dominated the market. In 1912, he thought that a conglomerate of theatres throughout the nation could buy or produce and distribute its own films. In 1917 Tally and J. D. Williams formed First National Exhibitors&#x27; Circuit.

The first film released through First National was the 1916 British film &quot;The Mother of Dartmoor&quot;. Between 1917 and 1918, the company made contracts with Mary Pickford and Charlie Chaplin, the first million-dollar deals in the history of film.

Chaplin&#x27;s contract allowed him to produce his films without a set release schedule. However, the production of the feature film &quot;The Kid&quot; ran so long that the company started to complain.

To address their concerns, Chaplin invited the exhibitors to the studio, and they were so impressed by the project and charmed by the players, especially co-star Jackie Coogan, that they agreed to be patient. That patience was ultimately rewarded when &quot;The Kid&quot; became a major critical and box office success.

First National&#x27;s distribution of films by independent producers is credited with launching careers including that of Louis B. Mayer.

First National Exhibitors&#x27; Circuit was reincorporated in 1919 as Associated First National Pictures, Inc., and its subsidiary, Associated First National Theatres, Inc., with 5,000 independent theater owners as members.

Associated First National Pictures expanded from only distributing films to producing them in 1924 and changed its corporate name to First National Pictures, Inc. It built its studio lot in Burbank in 1926. The Motion Picture Theatre Owners of America and the Independent Producers&#x27; Association declared war in 1925 on what they termed a common enemy—the &quot;film trust&quot; of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount, and First National, which they claimed dominated the industry not only by producing and distributing motion pictures but also by entering into exhibition as well.

== Acquisition by Warner Bros. ==

The financial success of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; and &quot;The Singing Fool&quot; enabled Warner Bros. to purchase a majority interest in First National in September 1928. Warner Bros. held 42,000 shares of common stock out of 72,000 outstanding shares while Fox Pictures held 21,000 shares; 12,000 shares were publicly held. Warner Bros. acquired access to First National&#x27;s affiliated chain of theatres, while First National acquired access to Vitaphone sound equipment. Warner Bros. and First National continued to operate as separate entities.

On November 4, 1929, Fox sold its interest in First National to Warner Bros. for $10 million. The First National studio in Burbank became the official home of Warner Bros.–First National Pictures. Thereafter, First National Pictures became a trade name for the distribution of a designated segment of Warner Bros. product. 45 of the 86 Warner Bros. feature films released in 1929 were branded as First National Pictures. Half of the 60 feature films Warner Bros. announced for release in 1933–1934 were to be First National Pictures.

Although both studios produced &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; budget pictures, generally the prestige productions, costume dramas, and musicals were made by Warner Bros., while First National specialized in modern comedies, dramas, and crime stories. Short subjects were made by yet another affiliated company, The Vitaphone Corporation (which took its name from the sound process).

In July 1936, stockholders of First National Pictures, Inc. (primarily Warner Bros.) voted to dissolve the corporation and distribute its assets among the stockholders in line with a new tax law which provided for tax-free consolidations between corporations. Although the 1939 release, &quot;Confessions of a Nazi Spy,&quot; was released as a First National Picture.

From 1929 to 1958, most Warner Bros. films and promotional posters bore the trademark and copyright credits &quot;A Warner Bros.–First National Picture&quot; in their opening and closing sequences.

<text>Francis Ford Coppola ( ; born April 7, 1939) is an American filmmaker. He is considered one of the leading figures of the New Hollywood and one of the greatest directors of all time. Coppola is the recipient of five Academy Awards, a BAFTA Award, six Golden Globe Awards, and two Palmes d&#x27;Or as well as nominations for two Emmy Awards and a Grammy Award.

Coppola started his career directing &quot;The Rain People&quot; (1969) and co-writing &quot;Patton&quot; (1970), the later of which earned him the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay along with Edmund H. North. Coppola&#x27;s reputation as a filmmaker was cemented with the release of &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974) which both earned Academy Awards for Best Picture, and the later earned him Best Director. The films revolutionized the gangster genre. Coppola released the thriller &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974), which received the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. 

His next film, the Vietnam War epic &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979), had a notoriously lengthy and strenuous production and also won the Palme d&#x27;Or, making Coppola one of only ten filmmakers to have won the award twice. He later directed films such as &quot;The Outsiders&quot; and &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; (both 1983), &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984), &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; (1986), &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (1990), &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992), &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (1997), and &quot;Megalopolis&quot; (2024). He also produced &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973), &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; (1979), and &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (1993).

Coppola&#x27;s father Carmine was a composer whose music featured in his son&#x27;s films. Many of his relatives have found success in film: his sister Talia Shire is an actress, his daughter Sofia is a director, his son Roman is a screenwriter and his nephews Jason Schwartzman and Nicolas Cage are actors. In 1997, he cofounded the literary magazine &quot;&quot; with Adrienne Brodeur. Coppola resides in Napa, California, and since the 2010s has been a vintner, owning a family-branded winery of his own. In 2024, Coppola was a Kennedy Center Honoree.

==Early life and education==
Francis Ford Coppola was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1939, to father Carmine Coppola (1910–1991), a flautist with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and mother Italia Coppola (née Pennino; 1912–2004), a family of second-generation Italian immigrants. His paternal grandparents came to the United States from Bernalda, Basilicata. His maternal grandfather, popular Italian composer Francesco Pennino, emigrated from Naples, Italy. At the time of Coppola&#x27;s birth, his father was an arranger and assistant orchestra director for &quot;The Ford Sunday Evening Hour&quot;, an hour-long concert music radio series sponsored by the Ford Motor Company. Coppola was born at Henry Ford Hospital, and those two connections to Henry Ford inspired the Coppolas to choose the middle name &quot;Ford&quot; for their son.

Francis is the middle of three children: his older brother was August Coppola, and his younger sister is actress Talia Shire.

Two years after Coppola&#x27;s birth, his father was named principal flutist for the NBC Symphony Orchestra, under the baton of Arturo Toscanini, and the family moved to New York. They settled in Woodside, Queens, where Coppola spent the remainder of his childhood.

Having contracted polio as a boy, Coppola was bedridden for large periods of his childhood, during which he did homemade puppet theater productions. He developed an interest in theater after reading &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1947) at age 15. He created 8 mm feature films edited from home movies with titles such as &quot;The Rich Millionaire&quot; and &quot;The Lost Wallet&quot;. Although Coppola was a mediocre student, his interest in technology and engineering earned him the childhood nickname &quot;Science&quot;. He trained initially for a career in music and became proficient in the tuba, eventually earning a music scholarship to the New York Military Academy. In all, Coppola attended 23 schools before he eventually graduated from Great Neck North High School.

He entered Hofstra University in 1955 as a theater arts major. There, he was awarded a scholarship in playwriting. This furthered his interest in directing theater, though his father disapproved and wanted him to study engineering. Coppola was profoundly impressed by Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s film &quot;&quot; (1928), especially the quality of its editing, and decided to pursue cinema rather than theater. He said he was influenced to become a writer by his brother August. Coppola also credits the work of Elia Kazan for influencing him as a writer and director. Coppola&#x27;s classmates at Hofstra included James Caan, Lainie Kazan and radio artist Joe Frank. He later cast Kazan and Caan in his films.

While pursuing his bachelor&#x27;s degree, Coppola was elected president of the university&#x27;s drama group, The Green Wig, and its musical comedy club, the Kaleidoscopians. He merged the two groups into The Spectrum Players, and under his leadership, the group staged a new production each week. Coppola also founded the cinema workshop at Hofstra and contributed prolifically to the campus literary magazine. He won three D. H. Lawrence Awards for theatrical production and direction and received a Beckerman Award for his outstanding contributions to the school&#x27;s theater arts division. While a graduate student, Coppola studied under professor Dorothy Arzner, whose encouragement was later acknowledged as pivotal to Coppola&#x27;s career.

==Career==
===1960–1969: Early works===
After earning his theater arts degree from Hofstra in 1960, Coppola enrolled in UCLA Film School attending with Bart Patton and Pete (John) Broadrick. There, he directed a short horror film, &quot;The Two Christophers&quot;, inspired by Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;William Wilson&quot; and &quot;Ayamonn the Terrible&quot;, a film about a sculptor&#x27;s nightmares coming to life. He also met undergraduate film major Jim Morrison, future frontman of The Doors.

In the early 1960s, Coppola made $10 per week (roughly equivalent to $ per week today). Looking for a way to earn some extra money, he found that many colleagues from film school made money filming erotic productions known as &quot;nudie-cuties&quot; or &quot;skin flicks&quot;, which showed nudity without implying any sexual act. At 21, Coppola wrote the script for &quot;The Peeper&quot;, a short comedy film about a voyeur who tries to spy on a sensual photo shoot in the studio next to his apartment. Coppola found an interested producer, who gave him $3,000 to shoot the film. He hired Playboy Bunny Marli Renfro to play the model and had his friend Karl Schanzer play the voyeur. With &quot;The Peeper&quot; finished, Coppola found that the cartoonish aspects of the film alienated potential buyers, who did not find the 12-minute short exciting enough to screen in adult theaters.

After much rejection, Coppola received an opportunity from Premier Pictures Company, a small production company that invested in &quot;The Wide Open Spaces&quot;, an erotic western written and directed by Jerry Schafer, which had been shelved for more than a year. Both Schafer&#x27;s film and &quot;The Peeper&quot; featured Renfro, so the producers paid Coppola $500 to combine the two films. After Coppola re-edited the picture, it was released as the softcore comedy &quot;Tonight for Sure&quot; (1962). Another production company, Screen Rite Pictures, hired Coppola to do a similar job: re-cutting the German film &quot;&quot; (&quot;Sin Began with Eve&quot;), directed by Fritz Umgelter. Coppola added new color footage with British model June Wilkinson and other nude starlets. The re-edited film was released as &quot;The Bellboy and the Playgirls&quot;. That same year, producer/director Roger Corman hired Coppola as an assistant. Corman first tasked Coppola with dubbing and re-editing the Soviet science fiction film &quot;Nebo Zovyot&quot; (1959), which Coppola turned into the sex-and-violence monster movie &quot;Battle Beyond the Sun&quot; (1962). Impressed by Coppola&#x27;s perseverance and dedication, Corman hired him as a dialogue director for &quot;Tower of London&quot; (1962), sound man for &quot;The Young Racers&quot; (1963) and associate producer and one of many uncredited directors for &quot;The Terror&quot; (1963).

Coppola&#x27;s first feature film was &quot;Dementia 13&quot; (1963). While on location in Ireland for &quot;The Young Racers&quot;, Corman persuaded Coppola to use that film&#x27;s leftover funds to make a low-budget horror movie. Coppola wrote a brief draft in one night, incorporating elements from Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot;, and the result impressed Corman enough to give the go-ahead. On a budget of $40,000 ($20,000 from Corman and $20,000 from another producer who wanted to buy the movie&#x27;s English rights), Coppola directed &quot;Dementia 13&quot; over the course of nine days. The film recouped its expenses and later became a cult film among horror buffs. It was on the set of &quot;Dementia 13&quot; that Coppola met the woman he would marry, Eleanor Jessie Neil.

In 1965, Coppola won the annual Samuel Goldwyn Award for best screenplay written by a UCLA student for &quot;Pilma, Pilma&quot;. The honor secured him a job as a scriptwriter with Seven Arts. During this time, Coppola also co-wrote the scripts for &quot;This Property Is Condemned&quot; (1966) and &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot; (1966). Coppola bought the rights to David Benedictus&#x27;s novel &quot;You&#x27;re a Big Boy Now&quot; (1963) and merged it with a story idea of his own, resulting in his UCLA thesis project &quot;You&#x27;re a Big Boy Now&quot; (1966), which earned him his Master of Fine Arts Degree from UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television in 1967. The film also received a theatrical release via Warner Bros. and earned critical acclaim.
Following the success of &quot;You&#x27;re a Big Boy Now&quot;, Coppola was offered to work on an adaptation of the musical &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; starring dance legend Fred Astaire and Petula Clark in her first American film. Producer Jack L. Warner was not impressed by Coppola&#x27;s shaggy-haired, bearded, &quot;hippie&quot; appearance and generally left him to his own devices. Coppola took the cast to the Napa Valley for much of the outdoor shooting, but those scenes were in sharp contrast to those filmed on a Hollywood soundstage, resulting in a disjointed look. None the less, &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; (1968) was a critical and commercial success. Clark received a Golden Globe Best Actress nomination. The film introduced Coppola to George Lucas, who became a lifelong friend and a production assistant on his next film.

&quot;The Rain People&quot; (1969) was written, directed, and initially produced by Coppola himself, though as the movie advanced, he exceeded his budget and the studio had to underwrite the remainder of the movie. It won the Golden Shell at the 1969 San Sebastián International Film Festival. Coppola wanted to subvert the studio system, which he felt had stifled his visions, intending to produce mainstream pictures to finance off-beat projects and give first-time directors a chance. While touring Europe, Coppola was introduced to alternative filmmaking equipment and, inspired by the bohemian spirit of Lanterna Film, decided he would build a deviant studio that would conceive and implement unconventional approaches to filmmaking. He decided to name his future studio &quot;Zoetrope&quot; after receiving a gift of zoetropes from Mogens Scot-Hansen, founder of Lanterna Film. Upon his return home, Coppola and Lucas searched for a mansion in Marin County to house the studio. However, in 1969, with equipment flowing in and no mansion found yet, the first home for Zoetrope Studio was a warehouse in San Francisco on Folsom Street. Andrew Sarris, in &quot;The American Cinema&quot; (1968), wrote: &quot;[Coppola] is probably the first reasonably talented and sensibly adaptable directorial talent to emerge from a university curriculum in film-making ... [He] may be heard from more decisively in the future.&quot;

=== 1970–1979: &quot;The Godfather&quot; and acclaim ===
==== &quot;Patton&quot; (1970) ====
Coppola co-wrote the script for &quot;Patton&quot; starting in 1963 along with Edmund H. North. This earned him his first Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. However, it was not easy for Coppola to convince Franklin J. Schaffner that the opening scene would work. Coppola later revealed in an interview,
When the title role was offered to George C. Scott, he remembered having read Coppola&#x27;s screenplay earlier. He stated flatly that he would accept the part only if they used Coppola&#x27;s script. &quot;Scott is the one who resurrected my version,&quot; said Coppola.

The movie opens with Scott&#x27;s rendering of Patton&#x27;s famous military &quot;Pep Talk&quot; to members of the Third Army, set against a huge American flag. Coppola and North had to tone down Patton&#x27;s actual language to avoid an R rating; in the opening monologue, the word &quot;fornicating&quot; replaced &quot;fucking&quot; when criticizing &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. Over the years, this opening monologue has become an iconic scene and has spawned parodies in numerous films, political cartoons, and television shows.

==== &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972) ====
&quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972) was a turning point in Coppola&#x27;s career. However, he faced several difficulties while filming. Paramount had owned the rights to Mario Puzo&#x27;s novel, about an American mafia family, for several years. Coppola was not Paramount&#x27;s first choice to direct; Sergio Leone was initially offered the job but declined in order to direct his own gangster opus, &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;. Robert Evans wanted the picture to be directed by an Italian American to make it &quot;ethnic to the core&quot;. Evans&#x27; chief assistant Peter Bart suggested Coppola, as a director of Italian ancestry who would work for a low sum and budget after the poor reception of &quot;The Rain People&quot;. Coppola initially turned down the job because he found Puzo&#x27;s novel sleazy and sensationalist, describing it as &quot;pretty cheap stuff&quot;. At the time, Coppola&#x27;s studio American Zoetrope owed over $400,000 to Warner Bros. for budget overruns on &quot;THX 1138&quot; and, when coupled with his poor financial standing, along with advice from friends and family, Coppola reversed his initial decision and took the job. 

Coppola was officially announced as director of the film on September 28, 1970. He agreed to receive $125,000 and six percent of the gross rentals. Coppola later found a deeper theme for the material and decided it should be not just be a film about organized crime, but also a family saga and a metaphor for capitalism in America. The story follows the Corleone family as patriarch Vito Corleone passes the reins of power to his son Michael. There was disagreement between Paramount and Coppola on casting; Coppola wanted to cast Marlon Brando as Vito, though Paramount wanted either Ernest Borgnine or Danny Thomas. Orson Welles was also considered. At one point, Coppola was told by the then-president of Paramount that &quot;Marlon Brando will never appear in this motion picture.&quot; After pleading with the executives, Coppola was allowed to cast Brando only if he appeared in the film for much less money than his previous films, would perform a screen test, and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production (as he had done on previous film sets). Coppola chose Brando over Borgnine on the basis of Brando&#x27;s screen test, which also won over the Paramount leadership. Coppola would later recall:

The film was a critical and commercial success, setting the box office record. Pauline Kael wrote: Coppola, a young director who has never had a big hit, may have done the movie for money, as he claims—in order to make the pictures he really wants to make, he says—but this picture was made at peak capacity. He has salvaged Puzo’s energy and lent the narrative dignity. Given the circumstances and the rush to complete the film and bring it to market, Coppola has not only done his best but pushed himself farther than he may realize. The movie is on the heroic scale of earlier pictures on broad themes, such as &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, and &quot;The Nun’s Story&quot;. It offers a wide, startlingly vivid view of a Mafia dynasty. The abundance is from the book; the quality of feeling is Coppola’s ... The direction is tenaciously intelligent. Coppola holds on and pulls it all together. The trash novel is there underneath, but he attempts to draw the patterns out of the particulars. It’s amazing how encompassing the view seems to be—what a sense you get of a broad historical perspective, considering that the span is only from 1945 to the mid-fifties, at which time the Corleone family, already forced by competitive pressures into dealing in narcotics, is moving its base of operations to Las Vegas.

In addition to Brando, the film starred Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale and Robert Duvall. It featured Richard Castellano, Sterling Hayden, Diane Keaton and Coppola&#x27;s sister Talia Shire. Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor, which he refused to accept. The film won Best Picture and the Best Adapted Screenplay. Coppola was nominated for Best Director but lost to Bob Fosse for &quot;Cabaret&quot;. For the score, Coppola commissioned Nino Rota, who had scored many Fellini films. Gordon Willis&#x27;s chiaroscuro cinematography was acclaimed, as was Dean Tavoularis&#x27;s period production design.

The film routinely ranks near the top of polls for the greatest movies ever. It was ranked third, behind &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941) and &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), on the American Film Institute&#x27;s inaugural AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies list in 1997. In 2007, it had moved to second place, ahead of &quot;Casablanca&quot; and behind &quot;Kane&quot;. David Thomson writes that &quot;&quot;The Godfather&quot; deserved all its success because it had the nerve to take its 175 minutes slowly ... It has a calm faith in narrative control that had not been current in Hollywood for twenty years. It was like a film of the forties in its nostalgic decor; its command of great supporting actors; in Gordon Willis&#x27;s bold exploration of a film noir in color; and in its fascination with evil.&quot;

==== &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974) ====
&quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974) further cemented Coppola&#x27;s reputation. It was influenced by Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Blowup&quot; (1966) and generated much interest when news leaked that it featured the same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the Nixon administration used to spy on political opponents in the Watergate scandal. Coppola claimed that this was purely coincidental, as the script for &quot;The Conversation&quot; was completed in the mid-1960s. However, audiences interpreted the film as a reaction to Watergate and its fallout. It stars Gene Hackman as Harry Caul, &quot;the best bugger on the West Coast&quot;, hired to spy on a young couple played by Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest. It features Cazale as his partner, Stan. The movie was a critical success and won Coppola his first Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. Coppola&#x27;s brother-in-law David Shire wrote the score and Walter Murch edited the picture, as Coppola started work on his next project.

==== &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974) ====
&quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; is both prequel and sequel to the first film, telling parallel stories of the rise of young Vito Corleone and the fall of his son Michael. After its five-hour-long preview, George Lucas told Coppola, &quot;You have two films. Take one away, it doesn&#x27;t work.&quot; Coppola claims it was the first major motion picture to use &quot;Part II&quot; in its title; he was influenced by Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s two-part &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot;. Paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;. According to Coppola, the studio&#x27;s objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen &quot;The Godfather&quot;, there was little reason to see an addition to the original film. However, the success of &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; began the Hollywood tradition of numbered sequels.

The movie received tremendous critical acclaim, with many deeming it superior to its predecessor. Kael wrote: Coppola has plunged us back into the sensuality and terror of the first film. And, with the relentlessness of a master, he goes farther and farther. The daring of Part II is that it enlarges the scope and deepens the meaning of the first film ... The first film covered the period from 1945 to the mid-fifties. Part II, contrasting the early manhood of Vito (played by Robert De Niro) with the life of Michael, his inheritor (AI Pacino), spans almost seventy years. We saw only the middle of the story in the first film; now we have the beginning and the end. Structurally, the completed work is nothing less than the rise and decay of an American dynasty of unofficial rulers ... Part II has the same mythic and operatic visual scheme as the first; once again the cinematographer is Gordon Willis. Visually the film is, however, far more complexly beautiful than the first, just as it’s thematically richer, more shadowed, more full. Willis’s workmanship has developed, like Coppola’s; even the sequences in the sunlight have deep tones — elegiac yet lyrical, as in &quot;The Conformist&quot;, and always serving the narrative, as the Nino Rota score also does. 

In addition to Pacino, Cazale, Duvall, Keaton and Shire reprised their roles from the first film. Newcomers included Michael V. Gazzo and Pacino&#x27;s mentor Lee Strasberg. &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won six, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Director. De Niro won Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Vito, making him and Brando the first actors to win Oscars for playing the same character. The film ranked at No. 32 on AFI&#x27;s inaugural 100 Years...100 Movies list, maintaining its position ten years later. It is ranked No. 1 on &quot;TV Guide&quot; &quot;50 Best Movies of All Time&quot; and at No. 7 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. Together, the two &quot;Godfather&quot;s placed at No. 4 on &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; 2002 list of the ten greatest films of all time. Thomson writes that &quot;it exhibited a mastery of so many periods and locations as to be entrancing.&quot; It was one of the last major American motion pictures to be filmed in Technicolor.

==== &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979) ====
Following the success of &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;The Conversation&quot; and &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, Coppola began filming &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, an adaptation of Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; (1899) set in Cambodia during the Vietnam War. It follows Willard (Martin Sheen) as he journeys upriver to find and assassinate the rogue Kurtz (Brando). The production in the Philippines was plagued by numerous problems, including typhoons, nervous breakdowns, the firing of Harvey Keitel, Sheen&#x27;s heart attack, Brando arriving overweight and unprepared and extras from the Philippine military and half of the supplied helicopters leaving in the middle of scenes to fight rebels. It was delayed so often it was nicknamed &quot;Apocalypse When?&quot; 

&quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; premiered at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival, where Coppola made grandiose claims, among them: &quot;My film is not about Vietnam, it &quot;is&quot; Vietnam.&quot; Despite such pronouncements, and complaints from critics that the film&#x27;s message was confused, it shared the Palme d&#x27;Or with Volker Schlöndorff&#x27;s &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; and won Oscars for Best Cinematography (Vittorio Storaro) and Best Sound (Murch, Mark Berger, Richard Beggs and Nat Boxer.) Roger Ebert wrote: 




The film&#x27;s reputation has grown and it is now regarded by many as a masterpiece of the New Hollywood and is frequently cited as one of the greatest movies ever made, ranking at Number 19 on the 2022 &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; poll. For the film, Murch was the first person to receive a credit as a Sound Designer. 

The documentary &quot;Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker&#x27;s Apocalypse&quot; (1991), directed by George Hickenlooper, Fax Bahr and Francis&#x27;s wife, Eleanor Coppola, who was present through the production, chronicles the difficulties the crew went through making &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; and features behind-the-scenes footage filmed by Eleanor. Coppola famously stated, &quot;We were in the jungle, there were too many of us, we had access to too much money, too much equipment and little by little, we went insane.&quot;

=== 1980–1989: Hard Times ===
&quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; marked the end of the &#x27;golden phase&#x27; of Coppola&#x27;s career. His Las Vegas-set musical fantasy &quot;One from the Heart&quot; (1982), while pioneering in its use of video-editing techniques, ended with a disastrous box-office gross of US$636,796 against a $26-million budget, and he was forced to sell the 23-acre Zoetrope Studio in 1983. He would spend the rest of the decade working to pay off his debts. Ebert wrote that the film was &quot;a ballet of graceful and complex camera movements occupying magnificent sets, and somehow the characters get lost in the process ... The storyteller of &quot;The Godfather&quot; has become a technician here. There are chilling parallels between Coppola’s obsessive control of this film and the character of Harry Caul, the wiretapper in Coppola’s &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974), who cared only about technical results and refused to let himself think about human consequences.&quot; Later critical evaluation has been more positive; Thomson calls the film &quot;enchanting and touching&quot;. &quot;One From the Heart&quot; starred Forrest, Teri Garr, Raúl Juliá, Nastassja Kinski and was scored by Tom Waits. 

In 1983, he directed &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by S. E. Hinton. Coppola credited his inspiration for making the film to a suggestion from middle school students who had read the novel. &quot;The Outsiders&quot; is notable for being the breakout film for a number of young actors who would go on to become major stars, including Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio and C. Thomas Howell. Also in the cast were Patrick Swayze, Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane, Tom Cruise and Rob Lowe (in his film debut). Carmine Coppola wrote and edited the score, including the title song &quot;Stay Gold&quot;, which was based on Robert Frost&#x27;s &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; and performed by Stevie Wonder. He directed &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;, filmed at the same time as &quot;The Outsiders&quot; on-location in Tulsa, Oklahoma and based on the novel of the same name by Hinton, who co-wrote the screenplay. Shot in black-and-white as an homage to German expressionism, &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; centers on the relationship between a revered former gang leader (Mickey Rourke) and his younger brother, Rusty James (Dillon). The film bombed at the box office, earning a meager $2.5 million against a $10 million budget. 

In 1984, Coppola directed the Robert Evans-produced &quot;The Cotton Club&quot;, based on the novel by James Haskins and centered on the eponymous Harlem jazz club. The film was nominated for several awards, including the Golden Globes for Best Director and Best Picture (Drama) and Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Art-Direction. However, the film failed at the box-office, earning only $25.9 million of the $47.9 million privately invested by brothers Fred and Ed Doumani. The same year, he directed &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot;, an adaptation of Washington Irving&#x27;s short story starring Harry Dean Stanton for Shelley Duvall&#x27;s &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot;. 

In 1986, Coppola directed &quot;Captain EO&quot;, a 17-minute space fantasy for Disney theme parks executive produced by George Lucas and starring Michael Jackson. Coppola, formerly a member of Writers Guild of America West, left and maintained financial core status in 1986. Also in 1986, Coppola released the comedy &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; starring Kathleen Turner, Jim Carrey and Coppola&#x27;s nephew Nicolas Cage. The film earned Coppola positive reviews and Turner her first and only Oscar nomination. It was Coppola&#x27;s first box-office success since &quot;The Outsiders&quot; and ranked number 17 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list of &quot;50 Best High School Movies&quot;.

The following year, Coppola re-teamed with James Caan for &quot;Gardens of Stone&quot;, but the film was overshadowed by the death of Coppola&#x27;s eldest son Gian-Carlo during the film&#x27;s production. The movie was not a critical success and underperformed commercially, earning only $5.6 million against a $13 million budget. Coppola directed &quot;&quot; the year after that. The film is a biopic based on the life of Preston Tucker and his attempt to produce and market the Tucker &#x27;48; Coppola had originally conceived the project as a musical with Brando leading. Ultimately, it was Jeff Bridges who played the role of Tucker. Budgeted at $24 million, the film received positive reviews and earned three nominations at the 62nd Academy Awards, but grossed a disappointing $19.65 million at the box office. It garnered two awards: Martin Landau won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and Dean Tavoularis took BAFTA&#x27;s honors for Best Production Design.

In 1989, Coppola teamed up with fellow Oscar-winners Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen for the anthology film &quot;New York Stories&quot;. Coppola directed the &quot;Life Without Zoë&quot; segment, starring Shire and co-written with his daughter Sofia. &quot;Life Without Zoë&quot; was mostly panned by critics and was generally considered to be the segment that brought the film&#x27;s overall quality down. Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote a particularly scathing review, stating: &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to know what Francis Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Life Without Zoë&quot; is. Co-written with his daughter Sofia, the film is a mystifying embarrassment; it&#x27;s by far the director&#x27;s worst work yet.&quot; Zoetrope Studios finally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1990, after which its name was changed to American Zoetrope.

=== 1990–1999: Continued work ===

==== &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (1990) ====
In 1990, he released the third and final chapter of &quot;The Godfather&quot; series: &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;. Coppola felt that the first two films had told the complete Corleone saga. Coppola intended &quot;Part III&quot; to be an epilogue to the first two films. In his audio commentary for &quot;Part II&quot;, he stated that only a dire financial situation caused by the failure of &quot;One from the Heart&quot; (1982) compelled him to take up Paramount&#x27;s long-standing offer to make a third installment. Coppola and Puzo preferred the title &quot;The Death of Michael Corleone&quot;, but Paramount Pictures found that unacceptable. While not as critically acclaimed as the first two films, it was still commercially successful, earning $136 million against a $54 million budget. Some reviewers criticized the casting of Coppola&#x27;s daughter Sofia, who stepped into the leading role of Mary Corleone, which was abandoned by Winona Ryder just as filming began. Despite this, &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; went on to gather seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Director and Best Picture. The film failed to win any of these awards, which made it the only film in the trilogy to do so.

In September 2020, for the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary, it was announced that a new cut of the film titled &quot;Mario Puzo&#x27;s The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone&quot; would have a limited theatrical release in December 2020 followed by digital and Blu-ray. Coppola said the film is the version he and Puzo had originally envisioned, and it &quot;vindicates&quot; its status among the trilogy and his daughter Sofia&#x27;s performance.

==== &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992) ====

In 1992, Coppola directed and produced &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;. Adapted from Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel, it was intended to follow the book more closely than previous film adaptations. Coppola cast Gary Oldman as the titular role, with Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder, and Anthony Hopkins in supporting roles. The movie became a box-office hit, grossing $82,522,790 domestically, making it the 15th highest-grossing film of the year. It fared even better out of the country, grossing $133,339,902 for a total worldwide gross of $215,862,692 against a budget of $40 million, making it the ninth highest-grossing film of the year worldwide. The film won Academy Awards for Costume Design, Makeup and Sound Editing.

==== &quot;Jack&quot; (1996) ====

Coppola&#x27;s next project was &quot;Jack&quot;, which was released on August 9, 1996. It starred Robin Williams as Jack Powell, a ten-year-old boy whose cells are growing at four times the normal rate due to Werner syndrome, which makes him look like a 40-year-old man at the age of ten. With Diane Lane, Brian Kerwin, and Bill Cosby, &quot;Jack&quot; also featured Jennifer Lopez, Fran Drescher and Michael McKean in supporting roles. Although a moderate box-office success, grossing $58 million domestically on an estimated $45 million budget, it was panned by critics, many of whom disliked the film&#x27;s abrupt contrast between actual comedy and tragic melodrama. It was also unfavorably compared with the 1988 film &quot;Big&quot;, in which Tom Hanks also played a child in a grown man&#x27;s body. Most critics felt that the screenplay was poorly written, not funny, and had unconvincing and unbelievable drama. Other critics felt that Coppola was too talented to be making this type of film. Although ridiculed for making the film, Coppola has defended it, saying he is not ashamed of the final cut of the movie. He had been friends with Robin Williams for many years and had always wanted to work with him as an actor. When Williams was offered the screenplay for &quot;Jack&quot;, he said he would only agree to do it if Coppola agreed to sign on as director.

==== &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (1997) ====

The last film Coppola directed in the 1990s, &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, was based on the 1995 novel of the same name by John Grisham. An ensemble courtroom drama, the film was well received by critics. Roger Ebert gave &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; three stars out of four, remarking: &quot;I have enjoyed several of the movies based on Grisham novels ... but I&#x27;ve usually seen the storyteller&#x27;s craft rather than the novelist&#x27;s art being reflected. By keeping all of the little people in focus, Coppola shows the variety of a young lawyer&#x27;s life, where every client is necessary and most of them need a lot more than a lawyer.&quot; James Berardinelli also gave the film three stars out of four, saying that &quot;the intelligence and subtlety of &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; took me by surprise&quot; and that the film &quot;stands above any other filmed Grisham adaptation.&quot; Grisham said of the film: &quot;To me it&#x27;s the best adaptation of any of [my books] ... I love the movie. It&#x27;s so well done.&quot; The film grossed about $45 million domestically, more than the estimated production budget of $40 million, but a disappointment compared to previous films adapted from Grisham novels.

According to Coppola, starting from this film onwards, he stopped working as a &quot;professional director&quot;, preferring to act more like a student who tried to understand what meant making a film, choosing to self-finance some &quot;very small, low-budget&quot; movies. Thus, those films weren&#x27;t meant to be successful but instead teach him what making films really mean, learning a lout about acting to the point of carrying out unusual rehearsals.

=== 2000–2018: Career fluctuations ===

==== &quot;Supernova&quot; re-edit ====

In the late 90&#x27;s Coppola was a board member of MGM, and in discussion of films they already had which could not be released, &quot;Supernova&quot; was among the most expensive. He was approached to supervise several of these, including &quot;The Fantastiks&quot; and &quot;Supernova&quot;, which he used his American Zoetrope facility in Northern California. This work included digitally placing Angela Bassett&#x27;s and James Spader&#x27;s faces on the bodies of (a computer-tinted) Robin Tunney and Peter Facinelli so that their characters could have a love scene. However, Coppola&#x27;s re-edited version had negative test screening and didn&#x27;t get the PG-13 rating by the MPAA that the studio wanted. Creature designer Patrick Tatopoulos, whose special effects were mostly cut out from the film, said that Walter Hill wanted the film to be much more grotesque, strange, and disturbing, while MGM wanted to make it more of a hip, sexy film in space, and not with full-blown makeup effects. &quot;I hope that my experience in the film industry has helped improve the picture and rectified some of the problems that losing a director caused&quot;, said Coppola. By October 1999, MGM decided to sell the film. The film was eventually released on January 17, 2000, almost two years later than planned.

Coppola was the jury president at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival and he also took part as a special guest at the 17th Midnight Sun Film Festival in Sodankylä, Finland, and the 46th International Thessaloniki Film Festival in Thessaloniki, Greece.

====&quot;Apocalypse Now Redux&quot;====
In the late &#x27;90s, Coppola began revisiting his films and creating new director&#x27;s cuts for release on home video. The first movie to receive this treatment was &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. The new version, &quot;Apocalypse Now Redux&quot;, restored 49 minutes that had been cut from the film before its original release in 1979, notably a visit to a French plantation. A number of actors came in to rerecord their lines for the deleted scenes, which were of inconsistent audio quality, and new music was composed. This version was released in cinemas in 2001 and later released on DVD. In 2006, it was collected with the theatrical cut on a deluxe DVD; subsequent home video releases have included both versions.

A. O. Scott wrote: &quot;&quot;Apocalypse Now Redux&quot; arrives in this slack season to remind us of a lost era of visionary cinema, a time of creative self-confidence that frequently flirted with hubris, but also a time of risk taking and high seriousness. The artistic vision on display in &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; -- the divine madness that inspired Mr. Coppola to risk his health, his sanity, his fortune and the well-being of his cast, crew and family -- is ultimately less impressive, and less important to the film&#x27;s durable power, than the art itself.&quot;

In 2005, Coppola created a new cut of &quot;The Outsiders&quot; for home video. This version, titled &quot;The Outsiders: The Complete Novel&quot;, added more than 20 minutes of footage and removed three scenes, bringing the film&#x27;s runtime from 91 minutes to 114 minutes. It also added new music by Michael Seifert and Dave Pruitt and several period songs to Carmine Coppola&#x27;s score. Coppola included both the theatrical cut and &quot;The Complete Novel&quot; on all subsequent home video releases.

===Return===
After a ten-year hiatus, Coppola returned to directing with &quot;Youth Without Youth&quot; in 2007, based on the novella of the same name by Romanian author Mircea Eliade. The film received generally negative reviews from critics. It was made for about $19 million and had a limited release, only managing $2,624,759 at the box-office. As a result, Coppola announced his plans to produce his own films in order to avoid the marketing input that goes into most films, which are intended to appeal to too wide an audience.

In 2009, Coppola released &quot;Tetro&quot;. It was set in Argentina, with the reunion of two brothers. The story follows the rivalries born out of creative differences passed down through generations of an artistic Italian immigrant family. The film received generally positive reviews from critics. The Rotten Tomatoes site&#x27;s consensus was: &quot;A complex meditation on family dynamics, &quot;Tetro&quot; arresting visuals and emotional core compensate for its uneven narrative.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars, praising it for being &quot;boldly operatic, involving family drama, secrets, generations at war, melodrama, romance and violence&quot;, Ebert also praised Vincent Gallo&#x27;s performance and claimed that Alden Ehrenreich is &quot;the new Leonardo DiCaprio&quot;. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a B+, judging that &quot;when Coppola finds creative nirvana, he frequently has trouble delivering the full goods&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; gave the film a mixed review, praising Ehrenreich&#x27;s performance, but claiming Coppola &quot;has made a movie in which plenty happens, but nothing rings true&quot;. The film made $2,636,774 worldwide, against a budget of $5,000,000.

&quot;Twixt&quot;, starring Val Kilmer, Elle Fanning, Joanne Whalley, and Bruce Dern, and narrated by Tom Waits, was released to film festivals in late 2011 and was released theatrically in early 2012. It received critical acclaim in France, but mostly negative reviews elsewhere.

In 2015, Coppola stated&quot;Distant Vision&quot; is a semi-autobiographical unfinished live broadcast project created in real-time. Proof of concepts were tested before limited audiences at Oklahoma City Community College in June 2015 and UCLA School of Theater in July 2016.

==== Further director&#x27;s cuts ====
In 2015, Coppola found an old Betamax tape with his original cut of &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; and decided to restore it. He had cut about a half hour out of the film before its original release at the insistence of the film&#x27;s European financial backers. Due to a combination of music rights, the loss of the original negative, audio issues, and MGM&#x27;s lack of interest in the project, Coppola wound up spending 500,000 dollars of his own money restoring the film. It was finally finished in 2017 and premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in 2019 as &quot;The Cotton Club Encore&quot;.

After finishing work on &quot;The Cotton Club&quot;, Coppola began work on a director&#x27;s cut of his first movie, &quot;Dementia 13&quot;. For this film, Coppola removed several minutes of footage that had been added by the film&#x27;s producer, Roger Corman. In 2019, he followed it up with another director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, this time called &quot;The Final Cut&quot;. It removed 20 minutes of footage that had been included in &quot;Apocalypse Now Redux&quot; and restored the film from the original negative for the first time.

In December 2020, a re-edit of &quot;Godfather III&quot;, &quot;The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone&quot; had a limited theatrical release, followed by digital and Blu-ray release in 2021. Coppola stated that &quot;The Godfather: Part IV&quot; was never made because Mario Puzo died before they had a chance to write the film. Andy García has since claimed the film&#x27;s script was nearly produced.

Coppola&#x27;s most recent director&#x27;s cut to date was &quot;B&#x27;Twixt Now and Sunrise&quot;, a shortened version of his film &quot;Twixt&quot;. It was given a select re-release in 2022.

At the 94th Academy Awards, they celebrated the 50th anniversary of &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Coppola attended alongside Robert De Niro and Al Pacino who were greeted with a standing ovation.

=== 2019–present ===

==== &quot;Megalopolis&quot; (2024) ====

In April 2019, Coppola announced that he planned to direct &quot;Megalopolis&quot;, which he had been developing for many years prior. Speaking to &quot;Deadline&quot;, he said: &quot;I plan this year to begin my longstanding ambition to make a major work utilizing all I have learned during my long career, beginning at age 16 doing theater, and that will be an epic on a grand scale, which I&#x27;ve titled &quot;Megalopolis&quot;.&quot; He had planned to direct the movie, a story about the aftermath and reconstruction of New York City after a mega-disaster, many years earlier, but after the real-life disaster of the September 11 attacks, the project was seen as being too sensitive.

In August 2021, it was announced that Coppola had begun discussions with actors for the project and that he was aiming to begin principal photography in the fall of 2022. In April 2022, it was reported that filming was to take place from September 6, 2022, to February 2, 2023. In May 2022, the star cast was revealed: Adam Driver, Forest Whitaker, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jon Voight, and Laurence Fishburne. In July, it was reported that filming would instead begin in November 2022 at Trilith Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia. In August, it was revealed that Aubrey Plaza, Talia Shire, Shia LaBeouf, Jason Schwartzman, Kathryn Hunter, James Remar, and Grace VanderWaal joined the cast. In early October, it was announced that Chloe Fineman, Dustin Hoffman, Bailey Ives, Isabelle Kusman, and D.B. Sweeney would also be joining the cast.

On February 29, 2024, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that &quot;Megalopolis&quot; will be released in IMAX in Fall 2024. On April 9, 2024, it was revealed that &quot;Megalopolis&quot; would be premiering in competition at the 77th Cannes Film Festival.

==== Future projects ====

In August 2024, one month ahead of the release of &quot;Megalopolis&quot;, Coppola told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he is not going to retire after his longtime passion project&#x27;s release, intending to work on two projects: an adaptation of &quot;The Glimpses of the Moon&quot; with &quot;strong dance and musical elements&quot; he plans to produce in England and &quot;Distant Vision&quot;, a &quot;live cinema&quot; project he&#x27;s been working on since 2015 that tells the fictionalized story of three generations within an Italian American family during the phenomenon of television&#x27;s invention.

==Commercial ventures==

===American Zoetrope===

In 1971, Coppola produced George Lucas&#x27; first feature film, &quot;THX 1138&quot;. Shortly after completion of production they brought the finished film to Warner Bros., along with several other scripts for potential projects at their newly founded company, American Zoetrope. However, studio executives strongly disliked all of the scripts, including &quot;THX&quot;, and demanded that Coppola repay the $300,000 they had loaned him for the Zoetrope studio, as well as insisting on cutting five minutes from the film. The debt nearly closed Zoetrope and forced Coppola to reluctantly focus on &quot;The Godfather&quot;.
American Zoetrope produced the film &quot;Clownhouse&quot;, the director of which, Victor Salva, was convicted of child sexual abuse and child pornography offences occurring during the making of that film. In 2006, Coppola said, &quot;You have to remember, while this was a tragedy, that the difference in age between Victor and the boy was very small -- Victor was practically a child himself.&quot; Salva was 29 at the time while the boy was 12.

====Zoetrope Virtual Studio====
American Zoetrope also administers the Zoetrope Virtual Studio, a complete motion picture production studio for members only. Launched in June 2000 as the culmination of more than four years of work, it brings together departments for screenwriters, directors, producers and other filmmaker artists, as well as new departments for other creative endeavors such as the short story vending machine project.

==== &quot;Pinocchio&quot; dispute with Warner Bros. ====
In the late 1980s, Coppola started considering concepts for a motion picture based upon the 19th-century Carlo Collodi novel &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;, and in 1991, Coppola and Warner Bros. began discussing the project as well as two others, one involving the life of J. Edgar Hoover and the other based on the children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;. These discussions led to negotiations for Coppola to both produce and direct the &quot;Pinocchio&quot; project for Warner Bros. as well as &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (which was made in 1993 and produced by American Zoetrope, but directed by Agnieszka Holland) and &quot;Hoover&quot;, which never came to fruition. A film was eventually made by Clint Eastwood in 2011 titled &quot;J. Edgar&quot;, which was distributed by Warner Bros.

However, in mid-1991, Coppola and Warner Bros. came to a disagreement over the compensation to Coppola for his directing services on &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. In 1994, Coppola later approached another studio, Columbia Pictures, to produce the film. Warner Brothers then wrote to Columbia, stating it had held the rights to Coppola&#x27;s project, which led to Columbia later dropping the project. Coppola filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros, alleging they had wrongfully prevented Columbia Pictures from making the film.

The parties deferred this issue and a settlement was finally reached on July 3, 1998, when the jurors in the resultant court case awarded Coppola $20 million as compensation for losing the &quot;Pinocchio&quot; film project. On that same day, Warner Bros. stated it would appeal the decision. A week later, Coppola was awarded a further $60 million in punitive damages on top, stemming from his charges that Warner Bros. sabotaged his intended version. However, in October 1998, then-Superior Court Judge Madeleine Flier reversed the jury&#x27;s $60 million award to Coppola. Warner Bros. and Coppola then appealed each other&#x27;s ruling, in which Coppola sought to have his $60 million award restored. In March 2001, the California Court of Appeals decided against Coppola on both counts. In July 2001, the California Supreme Court refused to hear the appellate decision, bringing the litigation battle to a conclusive end.

==== &quot;Contact&quot; dispute with Carl Sagan/Warner Bros. ====

During the filming of &quot;Contact&quot; on December 28, 1996, Coppola filed a lawsuit against Carl Sagan and Warner Bros. Sagan had died a week earlier, and Coppola claimed that Sagan&#x27;s novel &quot;Contact&quot; was based on a story the pair had developed for a television special back in 1975 titled &quot;First Contact&quot;. Under their development agreement, Coppola and Sagan were to split proceeds from the project as well as any novel Sagan would write with American Zoetrope and Children&#x27;s Television Workshop Productions. The television program was never produced, but in 1985, Simon &amp; Schuster published Sagan&#x27;s &quot;Contact&quot; and Warner Bros. moved forward with development of a film adaptation. Coppola sought at least $250,000 in compensatory damages and an injunction against production or distribution of the film. Even though Sagan was shown to have violated some of the terms of the agreement, the case was dismissed in February 1998 because Coppola had waited too long to file suit.

===Uptown Theater===
George Altamura, a real estate developer, announced in 2003 that he had partnered with several people, including Coppola, in a project to restore the Uptown Theater in downtown Napa, California, in order to create a live entertainment venue.

===Francis Ford Coppola Presents===
Coppola is the owner of Francis Ford Coppola Presents, a lifestyle brand under which he markets goods from companies he owns or controls. It includes films and videos, resorts, cafes, a literary magazine, a line of pastas and pasta sauces called Mammarella Foods, and a winery.

===Wineries===
====Francis Ford Coppola Winery====
The Francis Ford Coppola Winery near Geyserville, California, located on the former Chateau Souverain Winery, where he has opened a family-friendly facility, is influenced by the idea of the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, with swimming pools, bocce courts, and a restaurant. The winery displays several of Coppola&#x27;s Oscars along with memorabilia from his movies, including Vito Corleone&#x27;s desk from &quot;The Godfather&quot; and a restored 1948 Tucker Sedan as used in &quot;&quot;.

In August 2021, Coppola sold Francis Ford Coppola Winery and Virginia Dare Winery to Delicato Family Wines.

====Inglenook Winery====
Coppola, with his family, expanded his business ventures to include winemaking in California&#x27;s Napa Valley, when in 1975, he purchased the former home and adjoining vineyard of Gustave Niebaum in Rutherford, California using proceeds from &quot;The Godfather&quot;. His winery produced its first vintage in 1977 with the help of his father, wife, and children stomping the grapes barefoot. Every year, the family has a harvest party to continue the tradition.

After purchasing the property, he produced wine under the Niebaum-Coppola label. He purchased the former Inglenook Winery chateau in 1995, and renamed it to Rubicon Estate Winery in 2006. On April 11, 2011, Coppola acquired the Inglenook trademark paying more, he said, for the trademark than he did for the entire estate and announced that the estate would once again be known by its historic original name, Inglenook. Its grapes are entirely organically grown.

====Domaine de Broglie====
In October 2018, Coppola and family purchased the Vista Hills winery in Dayton, Oregon, and in 2019 renamed it to Domaine de Broglie.

===Resorts===

Included in the Francis Ford Coppola Presents lifestyle brand are several hotels and resorts, part of Coppola&#x27;s Hideaway company. The Blancaneaux Lodge in Belize, which from the early 1980s was a family retreat until it was opened to the public in 1993 as a 20-room luxury resort and The Turtle Inn, in Placencia, Belize, (both of which have won several prestigious awards including &quot;Travel + Leisure&#x27;s World&#x27;s Best: Best Resort in Central &amp; South America&quot;); La Lancha in Lago Petén Itzá, Guatemala; Jardín Escondido in Buenos Aires, Argentina; Palazzo Margherita in Bernalda, Italy; and the All-Movie Hotel in Peachtree City, Georgia, US.

===Cafe and restaurant===
In San Francisco, Coppola owns a restaurant named Cafe Zoetrope, located in the Sentinel Building where American Zoetrope is based. It serves traditional Italian cuisine and wine from his personal estate vineyard. For 14 years from 1994, Coppola co-owned the Rubicon restaurant in San Francisco along with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. Rubicon closed in August 2008.

===Literary publications===

Coppola bought into the San Francisco-based magazine &quot;City of San Francisco&quot; in 1973,&lt;ref name=&quot;time/magazine/CitizenCoppola&quot;&gt;
*
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theava/4034&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with the intent of publishing&lt;ref name=&quot;truthdig/godfather-gonzo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia.com/francis-ford-coppola&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thenation/authors/warren-hinckle&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;altaonline/a3503&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a &quot;service magazine&quot; that informed readers about sights and activities in selected cities. The magazine was unsuccessful,&lt;ref name=&quot;deseret/19237060&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and he lost $1.5 million on this venture.

In 1997, Coppola founded &quot;&quot;, a literary magazine devoted to short stories and design. The magazine publishes fiction by emerging writers alongside more recognizable names, such as Woody Allen, Margaret Atwood, Haruki Murakami, Alice Munro, Don DeLillo, Mary Gaitskill, and Edward Albee; as well as essays, including ones from Mario Vargas Llosa, David Mamet, Steven Spielberg, and Salman Rushdie. Each issue is designed, in its entirety, by a prominent artist, one usually working outside his / her expected field. Previous guest designers include Gus Van Sant, Tom Waits, Laurie Anderson, Marjane Satrapi, Guillermo del Toro, David Bowie, David Byrne, and Dennis Hopper. Coppola serves as founding editor and publisher of &quot;All-Story&quot;.

=== Cannabis brand ===
In 2018, Coppola launched Sana Company LLC and released a cannabis brand known as The Grower&#x27;s Series. The collection was created in partnership with the Humboldt Brothers, a Humboldt County cannabis farm. Coppola debuted the brand in San Francisco, California in October 2018 at the private cannabis dining club series known as Thursday Infused, organized by The Herb Somm, Jamie Evans. Coppola packaged The Grower&#x27;s Series in a mock black tin wine bottle resembling his wine brand. The Grower&#x27;s Series showcases three cannabis strains: a sativa, indica and hybrid.

=== Whisky advertisement ===
Coppola appeared in a commercial for Suntory Reserve in 1980 alongside Akira Kurosawa; the commercial was filmed while Kurosawa was making &quot;Kagemusha&quot;, which Coppola produced with George Lucas.

== Personal life ==
=== Family ===

In 1963, Coppola married writer and documentary filmmaker Eleanor Jessie Neil. She went on to co-direct &quot;Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker&#x27;s Apocalypse&quot;. Together they had three children, Gian-Carlo Coppola, Roman Coppola, and Sofia Coppola, all of whom became filmmakers. Gian-Carlo died in 1986 at the age of 22 due to a speedboating accident. He had one child, Gia Coppola, also a filmmaker. Nicolas Cage and Jason Schwartzman are Coppola&#x27;s nephews. He had an extramarital affair with Melissa Mathison—who would later write &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;—that began when she was his assistant on &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; and lasted through the making of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, nearly leading to Coppola&#x27;s divorce.

Eleanor Coppola died on April 12, 2024, at the age of 87.

=== Politics ===
During the 1980 United States presidential election, Coppola filmed a mass televised rally for California Governor and Democratic Party presidential candidate Jerry Brown at the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison. The rally failed in its goal to draw attention away from the other Democratic primary candidates Jimmy Carter and Ted Kennedy, forcing Brown to drop out of the race. Over the years, Coppola has worked with several Democratic political candidates, including Mike Thompson and Nancy Pelosi for the U.S. House of Representatives, and Barbara Boxer and Alan Cranston for the U.S. Senate.

== Favorite films ==
In 2012, Coppola participated in the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; film polls of that year. It is held every ten years to select the greatest films of all time, by asking contemporary directors to select ten films of their choice.

Coppola&#x27;s selections were:
* &quot;The Apartment&quot; (United States, 1960)
* &quot;Ashes and Diamonds&quot; (Poland, 1958)
* &quot;The Bad Sleep Well&quot; (Japan, 1960)
* &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (United States, 1946)
* &quot;I Vitelloni&quot; (Italy, 1953)
* &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; (United States, 1983)
* &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (United States, 1980)
* &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (United States, 1952)
* &quot;Sunrise&quot; (United States, 1927)
* &quot;Yojimbo&quot; (Japan, 1961)

==Awards and honors==


For &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; and &quot;The Conversation&quot;, Coppola was the third director to have two nominations for Best Picture in the same year. Victor Fleming was the first, with &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; in 1939; Alfred Hitchcock repeated the feat the next year with &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; and &quot;Rebecca&quot;. Since Coppola, two other directors have done the same: Herbert Ross with &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; and &quot;The Turning Point&quot; in 1977 and Steven Soderbergh with &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; and &quot;Traffic&quot; in 2000. He is one of ten directors to receive the Palme d&#x27;Or twice, for &quot;The Conversation&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.

On October 15, 2024, after having received the statue of the Capitoline Wolf, Rome&#x27;s highest honor, a street in the same capital city was named after him as a further sign of the connection between the filmmaker and the city. In 2024, he was honored by the Kennedy Center. Introducing him, his friend George Lucas said: “What Francis does creatively is jump off cliffs. When you spend enough time with Francis, you begin to believe you can jump off cliffs, too.” He is scheduled to receive the AFI Life Achievement Award in April, 2025.

<text>Finland, officially the Republic of Finland, is a Nordic country in Northern Europe. It borders Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east, with the Gulf of Bothnia to the west and the Gulf of Finland to the south, opposite Estonia. Finland has a population of 5.6 million. Its capital and largest city is Helsinki. The majority of the population are ethnic Finns. The official languages are Finnish and Swedish; 84.9 percent of the population speak the first as their mother tongue and 5.1 percent the latter. Finland&#x27;s climate varies from humid continental in the south to boreal in the north. The land cover is predominantly boreal forest biome, with more than 180,000 recorded lakes.

Finland was first settled around 9000 BC after the last Ice Age. During the Stone Age, various cultures emerged, distinguished by different styles of ceramics. The Bronze Age and Iron Ages were marked by contacts with other cultures in Fennoscandia and the Baltic region. From the late 13th century, Finland became part of Sweden as a result of the Northern Crusades. In 1809, as a result of the Finnish War, Finland was captured from Sweden and became an autonomous grand duchy within the Russian Empire. During this period, Finnish art flourished and the independence movement began to take hold. Finland became the first territory in Europe to grant universal suffrage in 1906, and the first in the world to give all adult citizens the right to run for public office. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Finland declared its independence. A civil war was fought in Finland the following year, with the Whites emerging victorious. Finland&#x27;s status as a republic was confirmed in 1919. During World War II, Finland fought against the Soviet Union in the Winter War and the Continuation War, and later against Nazi Germany in the Lapland War. As a result, it lost parts of its territory to the Soviet Union but retained its independence and democracy.

Finland remained a largely agricultural country until the 1950s. After World War II, it industrialised quickly and established an advanced economy, with a welfare state built on the Nordic model. This allowed the country to experience overall prosperity and high per capita income. During the Cold War, Finland officially embraced a policy of neutrality. Since then, it has become a member of the European Union in 1995, the Eurozone in 1999, and following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, joined NATO in 2023. Finland is a member of various international organisations, such as the Nordic Council, the Schengen Area, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The nation performs extremely well in national performance metrics, including education, economic competitiveness, civil liberties, quality of life, and human development.

== History ==
===Prehistory===

The area that is now Finland was settled in, at the latest, around 8,500 BC during the Stone Age towards the end of the last glacial period. The artefacts the first settlers left behind present characteristics that are shared with those found in Estonia, Russia, and Norway. The earliest people were hunter-gatherers, using stone tools.

The first pottery appeared in 5200 BC, when the Comb Ceramic culture was introduced. The area of present-day Finland was in the western limits of the culture, which produced pottery with a distinct comb pattern. The arrival of the Corded Ware culture in the south of coastal Finland between 3000 and 2500 BC may have coincided with the start of agriculture. Even with the introduction of agriculture, hunting and fishing continued to be important parts of the subsistence economy.

In the Bronze Age, permanent all-year-round cultivation and animal husbandry spread, but the cold climate slowed the change. The Seima-Turbino phenomenon brought the first bronze artefacts to the region and possibly also the Finno-Ugric languages. Commercial contacts that had so far mostly been to Estonia started to extend to Scandinavia. Domestic manufacture of bronze artefacts started 1300 BC.

In the Iron Age, population grew. Finland Proper was the most densely populated area. Commercial contacts in the Baltic Sea region grew and extended during the eighth and ninth centuries. Main exports from Finland were furs, slaves, castoreum, and falcons to European courts. Imports included silk and other fabrics, jewelry, Ulfberht swords, and, in lesser extent, glass. Production of iron started approximately in 500 BC. At the end of the ninth century, indigenous artefact culture, especially weapons and women&#x27;s jewelry, had more common local features than ever before. This has been interpreted to be expressing common Finnish identity.

An early form of Finnic languages spread to the Baltic Sea region approximately 1900 BC. Common Finnic language was spoken around Gulf of Finland 2000 years ago. The dialects from which the modern-day Finnish language was developed came into existence during the Iron Age. Contacts with the ancient Baltic and eastern Germanic peoples greatly influenced the Proto-Finnic language. Although distantly related, the Sami people retained the hunter-gatherer lifestyle longer than the Finns. The Sami cultural identity and the Sami language have survived in Lapland, the northernmost province.

The name has uncertain origins, but a common etymology with (the Sami) has been suggested. In the earliest historical sources, from the 12th and 13th centuries, the term Finland refers to the coastal region around Turku. This region later became known as Finland Proper in distinction from the country name Finland. 

===Swedish era===

The 12th and 13th centuries were a violent time in the northern Baltic Sea. The Livonian Crusade was ongoing and the Finnish tribes such as the Tavastians and Karelians were in frequent conflicts with Novgorod and with each other. Also, during the 12th and 13th centuries several crusades from the Catholic realms of the Baltic Sea area were made against the Finnish tribes. Danes waged at least three crusades to Finland, in 1187 or slightly earlier, in 1191 and in 1202, and Swedes, possibly the so-called second Crusade to Finland, in 1249 against Tavastians and the third Crusade to Finland in 1293 against the Karelians. The so-called first Crusade to Finland, possibly in 1155, most likely never occurred.

As a result of the Crusades, mostly with the Second Swedish Crusade led by Birger Jarl, and the colonization of some Finnish coastal areas with Christian Swedes during the Middle Ages, Finland gradually became part of the kingdom of Sweden and the sphere of influence of the Catholic Church. Under Sweden, Finland was annexed as part of the cultural order of Western Europe. The Swedes built fortresses in Häme and Turku, while a Swedish royal council was instituted, an administrative structure and fiscal apparatus was created, and law codes were codified during the reigns of Magnus Ladulås (1275–1290) and Magnus Eriksson (1319–1364). As a result, the Finnish lands were firmly integrated into the Swedish realm.
Swedish was the dominant language of the nobility, administration, and education; Finnish was chiefly a language for the peasantry, clergy, and local courts in predominantly Finnish-speaking areas. During the Protestant Reformation, the Finns gradually converted to Lutheranism. The end of the Kalmar Union ushered in an era of religious, social, and economic changes. Gustav Vasa () made his second son Johan the duke of Finland, while Gustav Adolf () created the office of governor-general for Finland as part of his restructuring of the administration of the Swedish realm.

In the 16th century, a bishop and Lutheran Reformer Mikael Agricola published the first written works in Finnish; and Finland&#x27;s current capital city, Helsinki, was founded by King Gustav Vasa in 1555. The first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was established by Queen Christina of Sweden at the proposal of Count Per Brahe in 1640.

The Finns reaped a reputation in the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) as a well-trained cavalrymen called &quot;Hakkapeliitta&quot;. Finland suffered a severe famine in 1695–1697, during which about one third of the Finnish population died, and a devastating plague a few years later.

In the 18th century, wars between Sweden and Russia twice led to the occupation of Finland by Russian forces, times known to the Finns as the Greater Wrath (1714–1721) and the Lesser Wrath (1742–1743). It is estimated that almost an entire generation of young men was lost during the Great Wrath, due mainly to the destruction of homes and farms, and the burning of Helsinki.

===Grand Duchy of Finland===

The Swedish era ended with the Finnish War of 1809. On 29 March 1809, after being conquered by the armies of Alexander I of Russia, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy within the Russian Empire, as recognised by the Diet of Porvoo. This situation continued until the end of 1917. In 1812, Alexander I incorporated the Russian province of Vyborg into the Grand Duchy of Finland. In 1854, Finland became involved in Russia&#x27;s involvement in the Crimean War when the British and French navies bombed the Finnish coast and Åland during the so-called Åland War.
Although Swedish was still widely spoken, the Finnish language began to gain recognition during this period. From the 1860s, a strong Finnish nationalist movement, known as the Fennoman movement, grew. One of the movement&#x27;s most prominent leaders was the philosopher and politician J.V. Snellman, who worked to stabilise the status of the Finnish language and its own currency, the Finnish markka, in the Grand Duchy of Finland. Milestones included the publication of what would become Finland&#x27;s national epic, the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, in 1835 and the legal equality of the Finnish language with Swedish in 1892. In the spirit of Adolf Ivar Arwidsson - &quot;we are not Swedes, we do not want to become Russians, so let us be Finns&quot; - a Finnish national identity was established. Nevertheless, there was no real independence movement in Finland until the early 20th century.

The Finnish famine of 1866–1868 occurred after freezing temperatures in early September devastated crops and killed around 15% of the population, making it one of the worst famines in European history. The famine led the Russian Empire to relax financial regulations, and investment increased in the following decades. Economic development was rapid. The gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was still half of that of the United States and a third of that of Britain.

From 1869 to 1917, the Russian Empire pursued a policy of Russification, which was suspended between 1905 and 1908. In 1906, universal suffrage was introduced in the Grand Duchy of Finland. However, relations between the Grand Duchy of Finland and the Russian Empire soured when the Russian government began to take steps to restrict Finland&#x27;s special status and autonomy. For example, universal suffrage was virtually meaningless in practice, as the tsar did not have to approve any of the laws passed by the Finnish parliament. The desire for independence gained ground, first among radical liberals and socialists, partly driven by a declaration called the&quot; February Manifesto&quot; by the last tsar of the Russian Empire, Nicholas II, on 15 February 1899.

===Civil war and early independence===

After the February Revolution of 1917, Finland&#x27;s position as a Grand Duchy under the rule of the Russian Empire was questioned. The Finnish parliament, controlled by the Social Democrats, passed the so-called Power Act to give the parliament supreme authority. This was rejected by the Russian Provisional Government, which decided to dissolve the parliament. New elections were held in which the right-wing parties won by a small majority. Some social democrats refused to accept the result, claiming that the dissolution of parliament and the subsequent elections were extra-legal. The two almost equally powerful political blocs, the right-wing parties and the Social Democratic Party, were deeply divided.
The October Revolution in Russia changed the geopolitical situation once again. Suddenly the right-wing parties in Finland began to reconsider their decision to block the transfer of supreme executive power from the Russian government to Finland when the Bolsheviks came to power in Russia. The right-wing government, led by Prime Minister P. E. Svinhufvud, presented the Declaration of Independence on 4 December 1917, which was officially approved by the Finnish Parliament on 6 December. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), led by Vladimir Lenin was the first country to recognise Finland&#x27;s independence on 4 January 1918.

On 27 January 1918, the government began to disarm the Russian forces in Ostrobothnia. The socialists took control of southern Finland and Helsinki, but the white government continued in exile in Vaasa. This led to a short but bitter civil war. The Whites, backed by Imperial Germany, prevailed over the Reds and their self-proclaimed Finnish Socialist Workers&#x27; Republic. After the war, tens of thousands of Reds were interned in camps where thousands were executed or died of malnutrition and disease. A deep social and political enmity was sown between the Reds and the Whites that would last until the Winter War and beyond. The civil war and the activist expeditions to Soviet Russia in 1918–1920, known as the &quot;Kinship Wars&quot;, strained relations with the East.
After a brief experiment with monarchy, when an attempt to make Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse the king of Finland failed, a republican constitution was adopted and Finland became a presidential republic, with K. J. Ståhlberg elected as its first president on 25 July 1919. A liberal nationalist with a legal background, Ståhlberg anchored the state in liberal democracy, promoted the rule of law and initiated internal reforms. Finland was also one of the first European countries to strongly promote women&#x27;s equality, with Miina Sillanpää becoming the first female minister in Finnish history in Väinö Tanner&#x27;s cabinet in 1926–1927. The Finnish-Russian border was established in 1920 by the Treaty of Tartu, which largely followed the historical border but gave Finland Pechenga () and its Barents Sea port. Finnish democracy survived Soviet coup attempts and the anti-communist Lapua movement.

In 1917 there were three million people in the country. After the civil war, a credit-based land reform was introduced, increasing the proportion of the population with access to capital. About 70% of the workforce was employed in agriculture and 10% in industry.

===World War II===

The Soviet Union launched the Winter War on 30 November 1939 to annex Finland in accordance with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany to divide Europe into spheres of influence between the two dictatorships. The Finnish Democratic Republic was set up by Joseph Stalin at the beginning of the war to govern Finland after Soviet conquest. There was widespread international condemnation of the unprovoked attack and it led to the Soviet Union being expelled from the League of Nations. The Red Army was defeated in numerous battles, most notably the Battle of Suomussalmi. After two months of negligible progress on the battlefield, as well as heavy losses in men and material, Soviet forces began to advance in February and reached Vyborg () in March. The Moscow Peace Treaty was signed on 12 March 1940, and the war ended the following day. Finland had defended its independence, but ceded 9% of its territory to the Soviet Union.
Hostilities resumed in June 1941 with the Continuation War, when Finland allied itself with Germany following the latter&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union; the main aim was to regain the territory lost to the Soviets barely a year earlier. Finnish troops occupied Eastern Karelia from 1941 to 1944. The massive Soviet Vyborg-Petrozavodsk offensive in the summer of 1944 led to a breakthrough until the Finns finally repulsed it at Tali-Ihantala. This partial Soviet success led to a stalemate and later an armistice. This was followed by the Lapland War of 1944–1945, when Finland fought retreating German forces in northern Finland.

The Armistice and treaty signed with the Soviet Union in 1944 and 1948 included Finnish obligations, restraints, and reparations, as well as further territorial concessions. As a result of the two wars, Finland lost 12% of its land area, 20% of its industrial capacity, its second largest city, Vyborg (), and the ice-free port of Liinakhamari (). The Finns lost 97,000 soldiers and were forced to pay war reparations of $300 million ($ in ). However, the country avoided occupation by Soviet forces and managed to retain its independence. Along with Great Britain, Finland emerged from the war as the only European country to have taken part in hostilities that was never occupied and managed to preserve its democracy throughout.

For a few decades after 1944, the Communists were a strong political party. Furthermore, the Soviet Union persuaded Finland to refuse Marshall Plan aid. However, in the hope of preserving Finland&#x27;s independence, the United States provided secret development aid and supported the Social Democratic Party.

===After the war===

The development of trade with the Western powers, such as the United Kingdom, and the payment of reparations to the Soviet Union led to Finland&#x27;s transformation from a primarily agrarian society to an industrialised one. Valmet, originally a shipyard and then several metal workshops, was established to produce materials for war reparations. After the reparations were paid, Finland continued to trade with the Soviet Union as part of bilateral trade.

In 1950, 46% of Finnish workers were employed in agriculture and a third lived in urban areas, but new jobs in manufacturing, services and trade quickly attracted people to the cities. The average number of births per woman fell from a baby boom peak of 3.5 in 1947 to 1.5 in 1973. As the baby boomers entered the workforce, the economy failed to create jobs fast enough and hundreds of thousands emigrated to more industrialised Sweden, with emigration peaking in 1969 and 1970. Finland participated in trade liberalisation in the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

During the Cold War, Finland officially embraced a policy of neutrality. The YYA treaty (Finno-Soviet Pact of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance) recognized Finland&#x27;s desire to remain outside great-power conflicts. From 1956 president Urho Kekkonen had a virtual monopoly on relations with the Soviet Union, which was crucial to his continued popularity. In politics, there was a tendency to avoid any policy or statement that could be interpreted as anti-Soviet. This phenomenon was dubbed &quot;Finlandisation&quot; by the West German press.
A market economy was maintained in Finland. Various industries benefited from trade privileges with the Soviets. Economic growth was rapid in the post-war period, and by 1975 Finland&#x27;s GDP per capita was the 15th highest in the world. During the 1970s and 1980s, Finland built one of the most extensive welfare states in the world. Finland negotiated a treaty with the European Economic Community (EEC, a forerunner of the European Union) that largely eliminated tariffs with the EEC from 1977.

Miscalculated macroeconomic decisions, a banking crisis, the collapse of its largest trading partner, the Soviet Union, and a global economic downturn caused a deep recession in Finland in the early 1990s. The recession bottomed out in 1993 and Finland enjoyed more than a decade of steady economic growth. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Finland began to integrate more closely with the West. Finland joined the European Union in 1995 and the euro zone in 1999. Much of the economic growth of the late 1990s was fuelled by the success of mobile phone manufacturer Nokia.

===21st century===
The Finnish people elected Tarja Halonen in the 2000 Presidential election, making her the first female President of Finland. Her predecessor, President Martti Ahtisaari, later won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008. Financial crises paralysed Finland&#x27;s exports in 2008, leading to weaker economic growth throughout the decade. Sauli Niinistö was elected President of Finland from 2012 until 2024, when Alexander Stubb took over.

Finnish support for NATO rose sharply after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Before February 2022, opinion polls showed a narrow but decisive majority against NATO membership; by April, a supermajority was in favour of membership. On 11 May 2022, Finland signed a mutual security pact with the United Kingdom. On 12 May, Finland&#x27;s president and Prime Minister called for NATO membership &quot;without delay&quot;. Subsequently, on 17 May, the Finnish Parliament voted 188–8 in favour of Finland&#x27;s accession to NATO. Finland became a member of NATO on 4 April 2023.

==Geography==

Lying approximately between latitudes 60° and 70° N, and longitudes 20° and 32° E, Finland is one of the world&#x27;s northernmost countries. Of world capitals, only Reykjavík lies more to the north than Helsinki. The distance from the southernmost point – Hanko in Uusimaa – to the northernmost – Nuorgam in Lapland – is .

Finland has about 168,000 lakes (of area larger than ) and 179,000 islands. Its largest lake, Saimaa, is the fourth largest in Europe. The Finnish Lakeland is the area with the most lakes in the country; many of the major cities in the area, most notably Tampere, Jyväskylä and Kuopio, are located near the large lakes. The Finnish coastline is speckled with the world&#x27;s largest archipelago, encompassing more than 50,000 islands, greatest concentration of which is found in the southwest, in the Archipelago Sea between continental Finland and the main island of Åland.

Much of the geography of Finland is a result of the Ice Age. The glaciers were thicker and lasted longer in Fennoscandia compared with the rest of Europe. The eroding effects have contributed to a mostly flat landscape in Finland, characterized by hills. However, in the northern regions, including areas bordering the Scandinavian Mountains, the terrain features mountainous elevations. At 1,324 metres (4,344 ft), Halti is the highest point in Finland. It is found in the north of Lapland at the border between Finland and Norway. The highest mountain whose peak is entirely in Finland is Ridnitšohkka at , directly adjacent to Halti.
The retreating glaciers have left the land with morainic deposits in formations of eskers. These are ridges of stratified gravel and sand, running northwest to southeast, where the ancient edge of the glacier once lay. Among the biggest of these are the three Salpausselkä ridges that run across southern Finland.

Having been compressed under the enormous weight of the glaciers, terrain in Finland is rising due to the post-glacial rebound. The effect is strongest around the Gulf of Bothnia, where land steadily rises about a year. As a result, the old sea bottom turns little by little into dry land: the surface area of the country is expanding by about annually. Relatively speaking, Finland is rising from the sea.

The landscape is covered mostly by coniferous taiga forests and fens, with little cultivated land. Of the total area, 10% is lakes, rivers, and ponds, and 78% is forest. The forest consists of pine, spruce, birch, and other species. Finland is the largest producer of wood in Europe and among the largest in the world. The most common type of rock is granite. It is a ubiquitous part of the scenery, visible wherever there is no soil cover. Moraine or till is the most common type of soil, covered by a thin layer of humus of biological origin. Podzol profile development is seen in most forest soils except where drainage is poor. Gleysols and peat bogs occupy poorly drained areas.

===Biodiversity===

Phytogeographically, Finland is shared between the Arctic, central European, and northern European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the WWF, the territory of Finland can be subdivided into three ecoregions: the Scandinavian and Russian taiga, Sarmatic mixed forests, and Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands. Taiga covers most of Finland from northern regions of southern provinces to the north of Lapland. On the southwestern coast, south of the Helsinki-Rauma line, forests are characterized by mixed forests, that are more typical in the Baltic region. In the extreme north of Finland, near the tree line and Arctic Ocean, Montane Birch forests are common. Finland had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.08/10, ranking it 109th globally out of 172 countries.

Similarly, Finland has a diverse and extensive range of fauna. There are at least sixty native mammalian species, 248 breeding bird species, over 70 fish species, and 11 reptile and frog species present today, many migrating from neighbouring countries thousands of years ago.
Large and widely recognized wildlife mammals found in Finland are the brown bear, grey wolf, wolverine, and elk. Three of the more striking birds are the whooper swan, a large European swan and the national bird of Finland; the Western capercaillie, a large, black-plumaged member of the grouse family; and the Eurasian eagle-owl. The latter is considered an indicator of old-growth forest connectivity, and has been declining because of landscape fragmentation. Around 24,000 species of insects are prevalent in Finland some of the most common being hornets with tribes of beetles such as the Onciderini also being common. The most common breeding birds are the willow warbler, common chaffinch, and redwing. Of some seventy species of freshwater fish, the northern pike, perch, and others are plentiful. Atlantic salmon remains the favourite of fly rod enthusiasts.

The endangered Saimaa ringed seal, one of only three lake seal species in the world, exists only in the Saimaa lake system of southeastern Finland, down to only 390 seals today. The species has become the emblem of the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation.

A third of Finland&#x27;s land area originally consisted of moorland, about half of this area has been drained for cultivation over the past centuries.

===Climate===
The main factor influencing Finland&#x27;s climate is the country&#x27;s geographical position between the 60th and 70th northern parallels in the Eurasian continent&#x27;s coastal zone. In the Köppen climate classification, the whole of Finland lies in the boreal zone, characterized by warm summers and freezing winters. Within the country, the temperateness varies considerably between the southern coastal regions and the extreme north, showing characteristics of both a maritime and a continental climate. Finland is near enough to the Atlantic Ocean to be continuously warmed by the Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream combines with the moderating effects of the Baltic Sea and numerous inland lakes to explain the unusually warm climate compared with other regions that share the same latitude, such as Alaska, Siberia, and southern Greenland.

Winters in southern Finland (when mean daily temperature remains below ) are usually about 100 days long, and in the inland the snow typically covers the land from about late November to April, and on the coastal areas such as Helsinki, snow often covers the land from late December to late March. Even in the south, the harshest winter nights can see the temperatures fall to although on coastal areas like Helsinki, temperatures below are rare. Climatic summers (when mean daily temperature remains above ) in southern Finland last from about late May to mid-September, and in the inland, the warmest days of July can reach over . Although most of Finland lies on the taiga belt, the southernmost coastal regions are sometimes classified as hemiboreal.

In northern Finland, particularly in Lapland, the winters are long and cold, while the summers are relatively warm but short. On the most severe winter days in Lapland can see the temperature fall to . The winter of the north lasts for about 200 days with permanent snow cover from about mid-October to early May. Summers in the north are quite short, only two to three months, but can still see maximum daily temperatures above during heat waves. No part of Finland has Arctic tundra, but Alpine tundra can be found at the fells Lapland.

The Finnish climate is suitable for cereal farming only in the southernmost regions, while the northern regions are suitable for animal husbandry.

A quarter of Finland&#x27;s territory lies within the Arctic Circle and the midnight sun can be experienced for more days the farther north one travels. At Finland&#x27;s northernmost point, the sun does not set for 73 consecutive days during summer and does not rise at all for 51 days during winter.

Finland is ranked 4th in Environmental Performance Index for year 2024. This Index combines various indicators around known issues around the world and measures how good they fit in among each countries on a scale. Finland scores good in parameters like Climate Change Mitigation, Waste Management, Air pollution, Air quality etc.

===Regions===

Finland consists of 19 regions (). The counties are governed by regional councils which serve as forums of cooperation for the municipalities of a county. The main tasks of the counties are regional planning and development of enterprise and education. In addition, the public health services are usually organized based on counties. Regional councils are elected by municipal councils, each municipality sending representatives in proportion to its population. In addition to inter-municipal cooperation, which is the responsibility of regional councils, each county has a state Employment and Economic Development Centre which is responsible for the local administration of labour, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and entrepreneurial affairs. Historically, counties are divisions of historical provinces of Finland, areas that represent local dialects and culture more accurately.

Six Regional State Administrative Agencies are responsible for one of the counties called in Finnish; in addition, Åland was designated a seventh county.
The county of Eastern Uusimaa (Itä-Uusimaa) was consolidated with Uusimaa on 1 January 2011.

====Administrative divisions====
The fundamental administrative divisions of the country are the municipalities, which may also call themselves towns or cities. They account for half of the public spending. Spending is financed by municipal income tax, state subsidies, and other revenue. , there are 309 municipalities, and most have fewer than 6,000 residents.

In addition to municipalities, two intermediate levels are defined. Municipalities co-operate in seventy sub-regions and nineteen counties. These are governed by the member municipalities and have only limited powers. The autonomous province of Åland has a permanent democratically elected regional council. Sami people have a semi-autonomous Sami native region in Lapland for issues on language and culture.

Health, social and emergency services are organised by the Wellbeing services counties. Finland has 21 Wellbeing services counties and the county structure is mainly based on the region structure. The County council, which is responsible for the operation, administration and finances of the area, is the highest decision-making body in the Wellbeing services county. The delegates and deputy commissioners of the county council are elected in the county elections for a term of office of four years. Wellbeing services counties are self-governing. However, they do not have the right to levy taxes and their funding is based on central government funding.

The capital region – comprising Helsinki, Vantaa, Espoo and Kauniainen – forms a continuous conurbation of approximately million people. However, common administration is limited to voluntary cooperation of all municipalities, e.g. in Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council.

==Government and politics==


===Constitution===
The Constitution of Finland defines the political system; Finland is a parliamentary republic within the framework of a representative democracy. The Prime Minister is the country&#x27;s most powerful person. Citizens can run and vote in parliamentary, municipal, presidential, and European Union elections.

===President===

Finland&#x27;s head of state is the President of the Republic. Finland had, for most of its independence a semi-presidential system of government, but in the last few decades the powers of the president have become more circumscribed, and consequently the country is now considered a parliamentary republic. A new constitution, enacted in 2000, made the presidency primarily a ceremonial office. The president appoints the prime minister as elected by Parliament, appoints and dismisses the other ministers of the Finnish Government on the recommendation of the prime minister, opens parliamentary sessions, and confers state honors. Nevertheless, the president remains responsible for Finland&#x27;s foreign relations, including the making of war and peace, but excluding matters related to the European Union. Moreover, the president exercises supreme command over the Finnish Defence Forces as commander-in-chief. In the exercise of his or her foreign and defense powers, the president is required to consult the Finnish government, but the government&#x27;s advice is not binding. In addition, the president has several domestic reserve powers, including the authority to veto legislation, to grant pardons, and to appoint several public officials. The president is also required by the Constitution to dismiss individual ministers or the entire government upon a parliamentary vote of no confidence.

The president is directly elected via runoff voting and may serve for a maximum of two consecutive 6-year terms. The current president is Alexander Stubb, who took office on 1 March 2024. His predecessors were Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg (1919–1925), Lauri Kristian Relander (1925–1931), Pehr Evind Svinhufvud (1931–1937), Kyösti Kallio (1937–1940), Risto Ryti (1940–1944), Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim (1944–1946), Juho Kusti Paasikivi (1946–1956), Urho Kekkonen (1956–1982), Mauno Koivisto (1982–1994), Martti Ahtisaari (1994–2000), Tarja Halonen (2000–2012), and Sauli Niinistö (2012–2024).

===Parliament===

The 200-member unicameral Parliament of Finland () exercises supreme legislative authority in the country. It may alter the constitution and ordinary laws, dismiss the cabinet, and override presidential vetoes. Its acts are not subject to judicial review; the constitutionality of new laws is assessed by the parliament&#x27;s constitutional law committee. The parliament is elected for a term of four years using the proportional D&#x27;Hondt method within several multi-seat constituencies through the most open list multi-member districts. Various parliament committees listen to experts and prepare legislation.

Significant parliamentary parties are Centre Party, Christian Democrats, Finns Party, Green League, Left Alliance, National Coalition Party, Social Democrats and Swedish People&#x27;s Party.

===Cabinet===
After parliamentary elections, the parties negotiate among themselves on forming a new cabinet (the Finnish Government), which then has to be approved by a simple majority vote in the parliament. The cabinet can be dismissed by a parliamentary vote of no confidence, although this rarely happens, as the parties represented in the cabinet usually make up a majority in the parliament.

The cabinet exercises most executive powers and originates most of the bills that the parliament then debates and votes on. It is headed by the Prime Minister of Finland, and consists of him or her, other ministers, and the Chancellor of Justice. Each minister heads his or her ministry, or, in some cases, has responsibility for a subset of a ministry&#x27;s policy. After the prime minister, the most powerful minister is often the minister of finance.

As no one party ever dominates the parliament, Finnish cabinets are multi-party coalitions. As a rule, the post of prime minister goes to the leader of the biggest party and that of the minister of finance to the leader of the second biggest.

The Orpo Cabinet is the incumbent 77th government of Finland. It took office on 20 June 2023. The cabinet is headed by Petteri Orpo and is a coalition between the National Coalition Party, Finns Party, the Swedish People&#x27;s Party, and the Christian Democrats.

===Law===
The judicial system of Finland is a civil law system divided between courts with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. Finnish law is codified and based on Swedish law and in a wider sense, civil law or Roman law. The court system for civil and criminal jurisdiction consists of local courts, regional appellate courts, and the Supreme Court. The administrative branch of justice consists of administrative courts and the Supreme Administrative Court. In addition to the regular courts, there are a few special courts in certain branches of administration. There is also a High Court of Impeachment for criminal charges against certain high-ranking officeholders.

Around 92% of residents have confidence in Finland&#x27;s security institutions. The overall crime rate of Finland is not high in the EU context. Some crime types are above average, notably the high homicide rate for Western Europe. A day fine system is in effect and also applied to offenses such as speeding. Finland has a very low number of corruption charges; Transparency International ranks Finland as one of the least corrupt countries in Europe.

===Foreign relations===
According to the 2012 constitution, the president leads foreign policy in cooperation with the government, except that the president has no role in EU affairs. In 2008, president Martti Ahtisaari was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

Finland&#x27;s relationship with Russia deteriorated following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, with a number of Russian diplomats expelled for spying, Russians restricted from visiting Finland and the general opinion immediately changing for Finland to join NATO, while it has also had a significant impact on the increasing strengthold of relations between the United States and Finland. According to the 2024 Global Peace Index, Finland is the 13th most peaceful country in the world.

===Military===

The Finnish Defence Forces consist of a cadre of professional soldiers (mainly officers and technical personnel), currently serving conscripts, and a large reserve. The standard readiness strength is 34,700 people in uniform, of which 25% are professional soldiers. A universal male conscription is in place, under which all male Finnish nationals above 18 years of age serve for 6 to 12 months of armed service or 12 months of civilian (non-armed) service.
Voluntary post-conscription overseas peacekeeping service is popular, and troops serve around the world in UN, NATO, and EU missions. Women are allowed to serve in all combat arms. In 2022, 1211 women entered voluntary military service. The army consists of a highly mobile field army backed up by local defence units. With a high capability of military personnel, arsenal and homeland defence willingness, Finland is one of Europe&#x27;s militarily strongest countries.

Finnish defence expenditure per capita is one of the highest in the European Union. The branches of the military are the army, the navy, and the air force. The border guard is under the Ministry of the Interior but can be incorporated into the Defence Forces when required for defence readiness.

Finland became a member of NATO on 4 April 2023, though it participated in the NATO Response Force before becoming a member. Before NATO membership, Finland has been part of the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) since 2017. Finland also contributes to the EU Battlegroup. Finland sent personnel to the Kosovo Force and the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. On 18 December 2023, Finland signed the DCA agreement with the United States, which regulates the presence of the US armed forces and their dependents on the territory of Finland, as well as the presence and activities of US suppliers.

===Human rights===
Finland has one of the world&#x27;s most extensive welfare systems, one that guarantees decent living conditions for all residents. The welfare system was created almost entirely during the first three decades after World War II.

Section 6 of the Finnish Constitution states: &quot;No one shall be placed in a different position on situation of sex, age, origin, language, religion, belief, opinion, state of health, disability or any other personal reason without an acceptable reason&quot;.

Finland has been ranked above average among the world&#x27;s countries in democracy, press freedom, and human development. Amnesty International has expressed concern regarding some issues in Finland, such as the imprisonment of conscientious objectors, and societal discrimination against Romani people and members of other ethnic and linguistic minorities.

In the report of the European umbrella organization ILGA-Europe published in May 2023, Finland ranked sixth in a European comparison of LGBTQ+ rights.

==Economy==
, Finland ranks 16th globally in nominal GDP per capita according to the IMF. Additionally, Finland boasts a well-developed welfare system that encompasses free education and universal healthcare, contributing to its reputation as one of the wealthiest nations.

The service sector constitutes the largest segment of the economy, amounting to 66% of the GDP, while manufacturing and refining make up 31%. Primary production accounts for 2.9% of the economy. Manufacturing is the primary economic sector concerning foreign trade. The predominant industrial sectors in 2007 were electronics (22%), machinery, vehicles, and other engineered metal products (21.1%), forest industry (13%), and chemicals (11%). The gross domestic product reached its peak in 2021. Finland has been ranked seventh in the Global Innovation Index of 2023 and 2024.

Finland has considerable timber, mineral (including iron, chromium, copper, nickel and gold) and freshwater resources. Finland&#x27;s gold production in 2015 was 9 metric tons. For the rural population, forestry, paper mills and agriculture are important. The Helsinki metropolitan area area accounts for roughly one-third of Finland&#x27;s GDP. Private services represent the largest employer in Finland.

Finland&#x27;s soil and climate pose particular challenges for crop production, with harsh winters and relatively short growing seasons, often interrupted by frost. However, the prevalence of the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current in Finland&#x27;s temperate climate allows for half of the world&#x27;s arable land north of the 60° north latitude. Although annual precipitation is generally adequate, it mostly transpires during winter, which poses a continuous risk of summer droughts. Farmers have adapted to the climate by relying on quick-ripening and frost-resistant crop varieties. They cultivate south-facing slopes and rich bottomlands to ensure year-round production, even during summer frosts. Drainage systems are often utilized to remove excess water. Finland&#x27;s agricultural sector has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and productivity, particularly in comparison to its European counterparts.

Forests are crucial to the nation&#x27;s economy, making it one of the world&#x27;s foremost wood producers and offering raw materials at competitive prices to the wood processing industries. The government has played an important role in forestry for a considerable period similar to that in agriculture. It has regulated tree cutting, sponsored technical improvements, and established long-term plans to guarantee the sustainability of the country&#x27;s forests in supplying the wood-processing industries.

, the average level of income, adjusted for purchasing power, was comparable to that of Italy, Sweden, Germany and France. In 2006, 62% of the labour force was employed by firms with fewer than 250 workers, which generated 49% of total business revenue. The employment rate of women is high. Gender segregation between male-dominated professions and female-dominated professions is higher than in the US. The proportion of part-time workers was one of the lowest in OECD in 1999. , the 10 largest private sector employers in Finland were Itella, Nokia, OP-Pohjola, ISS, VR, Kesko, UPM-Kymmene, YIT, Metso, and Nordea. , the unemployment rate was 6.8%.

, 46% of households consist of a single person, 32% two persons and 22% three or more persons. The average residential space is per person. In 2021, Finland&#x27;s GDP reached €251 billion. In 2022, altogether 74 per cent of employed persons worked in services and administration, 21 per cent in industry and construction, and four per cent in agriculture and forestry.

Finland has the highest concentration of cooperatives relative to its population. The largest retailer, which is also the largest private employer, S-Group, and the largest bank, OP-Group, in the country are both cooperatives.

===Energy===
The free and largely privately owned financial and physical Nordic energy markets traded in NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe and Nord Pool Spot exchanges, have provided competitive prices compared with other EU countries. , Finland has the lowest non-household electricity prices in the EU.

In 2021, the energy market was around 87 terawatt hours and the peak demand around 14 gigawatts in winter. Industry and construction consumed 43.5% of total consumption, a relatively high figure reflecting Finland&#x27;s industries. Finland&#x27;s hydrocarbon resources are limited to peat and wood. About 18% of the electricity is produced by hydropower In 2021, renewable energy (mainly hydropower and various forms of wood energy) was high at 43% compared with the EU average of 22% in final energy consumption. About 20% of electricity is imported, especially from Sweden due to its lower cost there. , Finland&#x27;s strategic petroleum reserves held 200 days worth of net oil imports in the case of emergencies.

Finland has five privately owned nuclear reactors producing 40% of the country&#x27;s energy. The Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository is currently under construction at the Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant in the municipality of Eurajoki, on the west coast of Finland, by the company Posiva.

===Transport===

Finland&#x27;s road system is utilized by most internal cargo and passenger traffic. The annual state operated road network expenditure of around €1 billion is paid for with vehicle and fuel taxes which amount to around €1.5 billion and €1 billion, respectively. Among the Finnish highways, the most significant and busiest main roads include the Turku Highway (E18), the Tampere Highway (E12), the Lahti Highway (E75), and the ring roads (Ring I and Ring III) of the Helsinki metropolitan area and the Tampere Ring Road of the Tampere urban area.

The main international passenger gateway is Helsinki Airport, which handled about 15.3 million passengers in 2023. Another 26 airports have scheduled passenger services. The Helsinki Airport-based Finnair, Blue1, and Nordic Regional Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle sell air services both domestically and internationally.

The Government annually spends around €350 million to maintain the network of railway tracks. Rail transport is handled by the state-owned VR Group. Finland&#x27;s first railway was opened in 1862, and today it forms part of the Finnish Main Line, which is more than 800 kilometers long. Helsinki opened the world&#x27;s northernmost metro system in 1982.

The majority of international cargo shipments are handled at ports. Vuosaari Harbour in Helsinki is the largest container port in Finland; others include Kotka, Hamina, Hanko, Pori, Rauma, and Oulu. There is passenger traffic from Helsinki and Turku, which have ferry connections to Tallinn, Mariehamn, Stockholm and Travemünde. The Helsinki-Tallinn route is one of the busiest passenger sea routes in the world.

===Industry===
Finland rapidly industrialized after World War II, achieving GDP per capita levels comparable to that of Japan or the UK at the beginning of the 1970s. Initially, most of the economic development was based on two broad groups of export-led industries, the &quot;metal industry&quot; (&quot;metalliteollisuus&quot;) and &quot;forest industry&quot; (&quot;metsäteollisuus&quot;). The &quot;metal industry&quot; includes shipbuilding, metalworking, the automotive industry, engineered products such as motors and electronics, and production of metals and alloys including steel, copper and chromium. Many of the world&#x27;s biggest cruise ships, including MS Freedom of the Seas and the Oasis of the Seas have been built in Finnish shipyards. The &quot;forest industry&quot; includes forestry, timber, pulp and paper, and is often considered a logical development based on Finland&#x27;s extensive forest resources, as 73% of the area is covered by forest. In the pulp and paper industry, many major companies are based in Finland; Ahlstrom-Munksjö, Metsä Board, and UPM are all Finnish forest-based companies with revenues exceeding €1 billion. However, in recent decades, the Finnish economy has diversified, with companies expanding into fields such as electronics (Nokia), metrology (Vaisala), petroleum (Neste), and video games (Rovio Entertainment), and is no longer dominated by the two sectors of metal and forest industry. Likewise, the structure has changed, with the service sector growing. Despite this, production for export is still more prominent than in Western Europe, thus making Finland possibly more vulnerable to global economic trends.

In 2017, the Finnish economy was estimated to consist of approximately 2.7% agriculture, 28.2% manufacturing, and 69.1% services. In 2019, the per-capita income of Finland was estimated to be $48,869. In 2020, Finland was ranked 20th on the ease of doing business index, among 190 jurisdictions.

===Public policy===
Finnish politicians have often emulated the Nordic model. Nordics have been free-trading for over a century. The level of protection in commodity trade has been low, except for agricultural products. Finland is ranked 16th in the 2008 global Index of Economic Freedom and ninth in Europe. According to the OECD, only four EU-15 countries have less regulated product markets and only one has less regulated financial markets. The 2007 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Finland 17th most competitive. The World Economic Forum 2008 index ranked Finland the sixth most competitive.

The legal system is clear and business bureaucracy less than most countries. Property rights are well protected and contractual agreements are strictly honoured. Finland is rated the least corrupt country in the world in the Corruption Perceptions Index and 13th in the Ease of doing business index.

In Finland, collective labour agreements are universally valid. These are drafted every few years for each profession and seniority level, with only a few jobs outside the system. The agreement becomes universally enforceable provided that more than 50% of the employees support it, in practice by being a member of a relevant trade union. The unionization rate is high (70%), especially in the middle class (AKAVA, mostly for university-educated professionals: 80%).

===Tourism===
In 2017, tourism in Finland grossed approximately €15.0 billion. Of this, €4.6 billion (30%) came from foreign tourism. In 2017, there were 15.2 million overnight stays of domestic tourists and 6.7 million overnight stays of foreign tourists. Tourism contributes roughly 2.7% to Finland&#x27;s GDP.

Lapland has the highest tourism consumption of any Finnish region. Above the Arctic Circle, in midwinter, there is a polar night, a period when the sun does not rise for days or weeks, or even months, and correspondingly, midnight sun in the summer, with no sunset even at midnight (for up to 73 consecutive days, at the northernmost point). Lapland is so far north that the aurora borealis, fluorescence in the high atmosphere due to solar wind, is seen regularly in the fall, winter, and spring. Finnish Lapland is also locally regarded as the home of Santa Claus, with several theme parks, such as Santa Claus Village and Santa Park in Rovaniemi. Other significant tourist destinations in Lapland also include ski resorts (such as Levi, Ruka and Ylläs) and sleigh rides led by either reindeer or huskies.

Tourist attractions in Finland include the natural landscape found throughout the country as well as urban attractions. Finland contains 40 national parks (such as Koli National Park in North Karelia), from the Southern shores of the Gulf of Finland to the high fells of Lapland. Outdoor activities range from Nordic skiing, golf, fishing, yachting, lake cruises, hiking, and kayaking, among many others. Bird-watching is popular for those fond of avifauna, however, hunting is also popular.

The most famous tourist attractions in Helsinki include the Helsinki Cathedral and the Suomenlinna sea fortress. The most well-known Finnish amusement parks include Linnanmäki in Helsinki and Särkänniemi in Tampere. St. Olaf&#x27;s Castle (&quot;Olavinlinna&quot;) in Savonlinna hosts the annual Savonlinna Opera Festival, and the medieval milieus of the cities of Turku, Rauma and Porvoo also attract spectators. Commercial cruises between major coastal and port cities in the Baltic region play a significant role in the local tourism industry.

== Demographics ==

The population of Finland is about 5.6 million. The birth rate is 7.8 per 1,000 residents, for a fertility rate of 1.26 children born per woman, one of the lowest in the world, significantly below the replacement rate of 2.1. In 1887 Finland recorded its highest rate, 5.17 children born per woman. Finland has one of the oldest populations in the world, with a median age of 42.6 years. Approximately half of voters are estimated to be over 50 years old. Finland has an average population density of 18 inhabitants per square kilometre. This is the third-lowest population density of any European country, behind those of Norway and Iceland, and the lowest population density of any European Union member country. Finland&#x27;s population has always been concentrated in the southern parts of the country, a phenomenon that became even more pronounced during 20th-century urbanization. Three of the four largest cities in Finland are situated in the Helsinki metropolitan area —Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa. In the largest cities of Finland, Tampere holds the third place after Helsinki and Espoo while also Helsinki-neighbouring Vantaa is the fourth. Other cities with population over 100,000 are Turku, Oulu, Jyväskylä, Kuopio, and Lahti.

Finland&#x27;s immigrant population is growing. , there were 571,268 people with a foreign background living in Finland (10.2% of the population), most of whom are from the former Soviet Union, Estonia, Sweden, Iraq, China and India. The children of foreigners are not automatically given Finnish citizenship, as Finnish nationality law practices and maintain &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; policy where only children born to at least one Finnish parent are granted citizenship. If they are born in Finland and cannot get citizenship of any other country, they become citizens. Additionally, certain persons of Finnish descent who reside in countries that were once part of Soviet Union, retain the right of return, a right to establish permanent residency in the country, which would eventually entitle them to qualify for citizenship. , 535,451 people in Finland were born in another country, representing 9,6 % of the population. The 10 largest foreign born groups are (in order) from Estonia, Sweden, Iraq, Russia, China, Ukraine, India, Somalia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Turkey.

Finland&#x27;s national minorities include the Sami, Romani people, the Jews and the Tatars. Romani people of the Finnish Kale group settled in the country at the end of the sixteenth century.

=== Language ===

Finnish and Swedish are the official languages of Finland. Finnish predominates nationwide while Swedish is spoken in some coastal areas in the west and south (with towns such as Ekenäs, Pargas, Närpes, Kristinestad, Jakobstad and Nykarleby.) and in the autonomous region of Åland, which is the only monolingual Swedish-speaking region in Finland. , the native language of 84.9% of the population was Finnish, which is part of the Finnic subgroup of the Uralic language. The language is one of only four official EU languages not of Indo-European origin, and has no relation through descent to the other national languages of the Nordics. Conversely, Finnish is closely related to Estonian and Karelian, and more distantly to Hungarian and the Sami languages.

Swedish is the native language of 5.1% of the population (Swedish-speaking Finns). Swedish is a compulsory school subject and general knowledge of the language is good among many non-native speakers. Likewise, a majority of Swedish-speaking non-Ålanders can speak Finnish. The Finnish side of the land border with Sweden is unilingually Finnish-speaking. The Swedish across the border is distinct from the Swedish spoken in Finland. There is a sizeable pronunciation difference between the varieties of Swedish spoken in the two countries, although their mutual intelligibility is nearly universal.

Finnish Romani is spoken by some 5,000–6,000 people; there are 13,000-14,000 Romani people in Finland Romani and Finnish Sign Language are also recognized in the constitution. There are two sign languages: Finnish Sign Language, spoken natively by 4,000–5,000 people, and Finland-Swedish Sign Language, spoken natively by about 150 people. Tatar is spoken by a Finnish Tatar minority of about 800 people whose ancestors moved to Finland mainly between the 1870s and 1920s.

The Sámi languages have an official status in parts of Lapland, where the Sámi, numbering over 10,000 are recognized as an indigenous people. About a quarter of them speak a Sami language as their mother tongue. The Sami languages that are spoken in Finland are Northern Sami, Inari Sami, and Skolt Sami. The rights of minority groups (in particular Sami, Swedish speakers, and Romani people) are protected by the constitution. The Nordic languages and Karelian are also specially recognized in parts of Finland.

, the most common foreign languages are Russian (1.8%), Estonian (0.9%), Arabic (0.7%), English (0.6%) and Ukrainian (0.5%).

English is studied by most pupils as a compulsory subject from the first grade (at seven years of age), formerly from the third or fifth grade, in the comprehensive school (in some schools other languages can be chosen instead). German, French, Spanish and Russian can be studied as second foreign languages from the fourth grade (at 10 years of age; some schools may offer other options).

=== Largest cities ===
=== Religion ===

With 3.5 million members, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland is Finland&#x27;s largest religious body; at the end of 2023, 63.6% of Finns were members of the church. The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland has seen its share of the country&#x27;s population declining by roughly one percent annually in recent years. The decline has been due to both church membership resignations and falling baptism rates. The second largest group, accounting for 26.3% of the population in 2017, has no religious affiliation. A small minority belongs to the Finnish Orthodox Church (1.1%). Other Protestant denominations and the Roman Catholic Church are significantly smaller, as are the Jewish and other non-Christian communities (totalling 1.6%). The Pew Research Center estimated the Muslim population at 2.7% in 2016.

Finland&#x27;s state church was the Church of Sweden until 1809. As an autonomous Grand Duchy under Russia from 1809 to 1917, Finland retained the Lutheran State Church system, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland was established. After Finland had gained independence in 1917, religious freedom was declared in the constitution of 1919, and a separate law on religious freedom in 1922. Through this arrangement, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland gained a constitutional status as a national church alongside the Finnish Orthodox Church, whose position however is not codified in the constitution. The main Lutheran and Orthodox churches have special roles such as in state ceremonies and schools.

In 2016, 69.3% of Finnish children were baptized and 82.3% were confirmed in 2012 at the age of 15, and over 90% of the funerals are Christian. However, the majority of Lutherans attend church only for special occasions like Christmas ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. The Lutheran Church estimates that approximately 1.8% of its members attend church services weekly. The average number of church visits per year by church members is approximately two.

According to a 2010 Eurobarometer poll, 33% of Finnish citizens responded that they &quot;believe there is a God&quot;; 42% answered that they &quot;believe there is some sort of spirit or life force&quot;; and 22% that they &quot;do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force&quot;. According to ISSP survey data (2008), 8% consider themselves &quot;highly religious&quot;, and 31% &quot;moderately religious&quot;. In the same survey, 28% reported themselves as &quot;agnostic&quot; and 29% as &quot;non-religious&quot;.

=== Health ===
Life expectancy was 79 years for men and 84 years for women in 2017. The under-five mortality rate was 2.3 per 1,000 live births in 2017, ranking Finland&#x27;s rate among the lowest in the world. The fertility rate in 2014 stood at 1.71 children born/per woman and has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 since 1969. With a low birth rate women also become mothers at a later age, the mean age at first live birth being 28.6 in 2014. A 2011 study published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; medical journal found that Finland had the lowest stillbirth rate out of 193 countries.

There has been a slight increase or no change in welfare and health inequalities between population groups in the 21st century. Lifestyle-related diseases are on the rise. More than half a million Finns suffer from diabetes, type 1 diabetes being globally the most common in Finland. Many children are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The number of musculoskeletal diseases and cancers are increasing, although the cancer prognosis has improved. Allergies and dementia are also growing health problems in Finland. One of the most common reasons for work disability are due to mental disorders, in particular depression. Without age standardization, the suicide rates were 13 per 100 000 in 2015, close to the North European average. Age-standardized suicide rates are still among the highest among developed countries in the OECD.

There are 307 residents for each doctor. About 19% of health care is funded directly by households and 77% by taxation.

In April 2012, Finland was ranked second in Gross National Happiness in a report published by The Earth Institute. Since 2012, Finland has every time ranked at least in the top 5 of world&#x27;s happiest countries in the annual World Happiness Report by the United Nations, as well as ranking as the happiest country since 2018.

=== Education and science ===
Most pre-tertiary education is arranged at the municipal level. Around 3 percent of students are enrolled in private schools (mostly specialist language and international schools). Formal education is usually started at the age of 7. Primary school takes normally six years and lower secondary school three years.

The curriculum is set by the Ministry of Education and Culture and the Education Board. Education is compulsory between the ages of 7 and 18. After lower secondary school, graduates may apply to trade schools or gymnasiums (upper secondary schools). Trade schools offer a vocational education: approximately 40% of an age group choose this path after the lower secondary school. Academically oriented gymnasiums have higher entrance requirements and specifically prepare for Abitur and tertiary education. Graduation from either formally qualifies for tertiary education.

In tertiary education, two mostly separate and non-interoperating sectors are found: the profession-oriented polytechnics and the research-oriented universities. Education is free and living expenses are to a large extent financed by the government through student benefits. There are 15 universities and 24 Universities of Applied Sciences (UAS) in the country. The University of Helsinki is ranked 75th in the Top University Ranking of 2010. Other reputable universities of Finland include Aalto University in Espoo, both University of Turku and Åbo Akademi University in Turku, University of Jyväskylä, University of Oulu, LUT University in Lappeenranta and Lahti, University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio and Joensuu, and Tampere University.

The World Economic Forum ranks Finland&#x27;s tertiary education No. 1 in the world. Around 33% of residents have a tertiary degree, similar to Nordics and more than in most other OECD countries except Canada (44%), United States (38%) and Japan (37%). In addition, 38% of Finland&#x27;s population has a university or college degree, which is among the highest percentages in the world. Adult education appears in several forms, such as secondary evening schools, civic and workers&#x27; institutes, study centres, vocational course centres, and folk high schools.

More than 30% of tertiary graduates are in science-related fields. Forest improvement, materials research, environmental sciences, neural networks, low-temperature physics, brain research, biotechnology, genetic technology, and communications showcase fields of study where Finnish researchers have had a significant impact. Finland is highly productive in scientific research. In 2005, Finland had the fourth most scientific publications per capita of the OECD countries. In 2007, 1,801 patents were filed in Finland.

== Culture ==
=== Literature ===
Written Finnish could be said to have existed since Mikael Agricola translated the New Testament into Finnish during the Protestant Reformation, but few notable works of literature were written until the 19th century and the beginning of a Finnish national Romantic Movement. This prompted Elias Lönnrot to collect Finnish and Karelian folk poetry and arrange and publish them as the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, the Finnish national epic. The era saw a rise of poets and novelists who wrote in Finnish, notably the national writer of Finland, Aleksis Kivi (&quot;The Seven Brothers&quot;), and Minna Canth, Eino Leino, and Juhani Aho. Many writers of the national awakening wrote in Swedish, such as the national poet J. L. Runeberg (&quot;The Tales of Ensign Stål&quot;) and Zachris Topelius.

After Finland became independent, there was a rise of modernist writers, most famously the Swedish-speaking poet Edith Södergran. Finnish-speaking authors explored national and historical themes. Most famous of them were Frans Eemil Sillanpää, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1939, historical novelist Mika Waltari, and Väinö Linna with his &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; and &quot;Under the North&quot; Star trilogy. Beginning with Paavo Haavikko, Finnish poetry adopted modernism. Besides Lönnrot&#x27;s &quot;Kalevala&quot; and Waltari, the Swedish-speaking Tove Jansson, best known as the creator of &quot;The Moomins&quot;, is the most translated Finnish writer; her books have been translated into more than 40 languages.

=== Visual arts, design, and architecture ===
The visual arts in Finland started to form their characteristics in the 19th century when Romantic nationalism was rising in autonomic Finland. The best known Finnish painters, Akseli Gallen-Kallela, started painting in a naturalist style but moved to national romanticism. Other notable painters of the era include Pekka Halonen, Eero Järnefelt, Helene Schjerfbeck and Hugo Simberg. In the late 20th century, the homoerotic art of Touko Laaksonen, pseudonym Tom of Finland, found a worldwide audience.

Finland&#x27;s best-known sculptor of the 20th century was Wäinö Aaltonen, remembered for his monumental busts and sculptures. The works of Eila Hiltunen and Laila Pullinen exemplifies the modernism in sculpture.

Finns have made major contributions to handicrafts and industrial design: among the internationally renowned figures are Timo Sarpaneva, Tapio Wirkkala and Ilmari Tapiovaara. Finnish architecture is famous around the world, and has contributed significantly to several styles internationally, such as Jugendstil (or Art Nouveau), Nordic Classicism and functionalism. Among the top 20th-century Finnish architects to gain international recognition are Eliel Saarinen and his son Eero Saarinen. Architect Alvar Aalto is regarded as among the most important 20th-century designers in the world; he helped bring functionalist architecture to Finland, but soon was a pioneer in its development towards an organic style. Aalto is also famous for his work in furniture, lamps, textiles, and glassware, which were usually incorporated into his buildings.

=== Music ===
;Folk
Finnish folk music can be divided into Nordic dance music and the older tradition of poem singing, poems from which the national epic, the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, was created.
Much of Finland&#x27;s classical music is influenced by traditional Finnish and Karelian melodies and lyrics, as comprised in the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. In the historical region of Finnish Karelia, as well as other parts of Eastern Finland, the old poem singing traditions were preserved better than in the western parts of the country. In the 19th century Nordic folk dance music largely replaced the kalevaic tradition. Finnish folk music has undergone a roots revival and has become a part of popular music. The people of northern Finland, Sweden, and Norway, the Sami, are known primarily for highly spiritual songs called joik.

;Classical

The first Finnish opera was written by the German-born composer Fredrik Pacius in 1852. Pacius also wrote the music to the poem &quot;Maamme/Vårt land&quot; (Our Country), Finland&#x27;s national anthem. In the 1890s Finnish nationalism based on the &quot;Kalevala&quot; spread, and Jean Sibelius became famous for his vocal symphony &quot;Kullervo&quot;. In 1899 he composed &quot;Finlandia&quot;, which played an important role in Finland gaining independence. He remains one of Finland&#x27;s most popular national figures.

Alongside Sibelius, the distinct Finnish style of music was created by Oskar Merikanto, Toivo Kuula, Erkki Melartin, Leevi Madetoja and Uuno Klami. Important modernist composers include Einojuhani Rautavaara, Aulis Sallinen and Magnus Lindberg, among others. Kaija Saariaho was ranked the world&#x27;s greatest living composer in a 2019 composers&#x27; poll. Many Finnish musicians have achieved international success. Among them are the conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen, the opera singer Karita Mattila and the violinist Pekka Kuusisto.

;Popular music

&quot;Iskelmä&quot; (coined directly from the German word &quot;Schlager&quot;, meaning &quot;hit&quot;) is a traditional Finnish word for a light popular song.Finnish popular music also includes various kinds of dance music; tango, a style of Argentine music, is also popular. The light music in Swedish-speaking areas has more influences from Sweden. At least a couple of Finnish polkas are known worldwide, such as &quot;Säkkijärven polkka&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

During the 1970s, progressive rock group Wigwam and rock and roll group Hurriganes gained respect abroad. The Finnish punk scene produced some internationally acknowledged names including Terveet Kädet in the 1980s. Hanoi Rocks was a pioneering glam rock act. Many Finnish metal bands have gained international recognition; Finland has been often called the &quot;Promised Land of Heavy Metal&quot; because there are more than 50 metal Bands for every 100,000 inhabitants – more than any other nation in the world. Modern Finnish popular music includes a number of prominent rock musicians, pop musicians, jazz musicians, hip hop performers, and dance music acts.

Finland has won the Eurovision Song Contest once in 2006 when Lordi won the contest with the song &quot;Hard Rock Hallelujah&quot;. The Finnish pop artist Käärijä also got second place in the contest in 2023 with his worldwide hit song &quot;Cha Cha Cha&quot;.

=== Cinema and television ===

In the film industry, notable modern directors include brothers Mika and Aki Kaurismäki, Dome Karukoski, Antti Jokinen, Jalmari Helander, and Renny Harlin. Some Finnish drama series are internationally known, such as &quot;Bordertown&quot;.

One of the most internationally successful Finnish films are &quot;The White Reindeer&quot;, directed by Erik Blomberg in 1952, which won the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film in 1956; &quot;The Man Without a Past&quot;, directed by Aki Kaurismäki in 2002, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2002 and won the Grand Prix at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival; and &quot;The Fencer&quot;, directed by Klaus Härö in 2015, which was nominated for the 73rd Golden Globe Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category as a Finnish/German/Estonian co-production.

In Finland, the most significant films include &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;, directed by Edvin Laine in 1955. &quot;Here, Beneath the North Star&quot; from 1968, is also one of the most significant works in Finnish history. A 1960 crime comedy film &quot;Inspector Palmu&#x27;s Mistake&quot;, directed by Matti Kassila, was voted in 2012 the best Finnish film of all time by Finnish film critics and journalists, but the 1984 comedy film &quot;Uuno Turhapuro in the Army&quot;, the ninth film in &quot;Uuno Turhapuro&quot; film series, remains Finland&#x27;s most seen domestic film made since 1968 by Finnish audience.

=== Media and communications ===

Today, there are around 200 newspapers, 320 popular magazines, 2,100 professional magazines, and 67 commercial radio stations. The largest newspaper is , its circulation being 339,437 . Yle, the Finnish Broadcasting Company, operates five television channels and thirteen radio channels. Each year, around 12,000 book titles are published.

Thanks to its emphasis on transparency and equal rights, Finland&#x27;s press has been rated the freest in the world. Worldwide, Finns, along with other Nordic peoples and the Japanese, spend the most time reading newspapers. In regards to telecommunication infrastructure, Finland is the highest ranked country in the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Network Readiness Index (NRI) – an indicator for determining the development level of a country&#x27;s information and communication technologies.

=== Sauna ===
The Finns&#x27; love for saunas is generally associated with Finnish cultural tradition. Sauna is a type of dry steam bath practiced widely in Finland, which is especially evident in the strong tradition around Midsummer and Christmas. The word sauna is of Proto-Finnish origin (found in Finnic and Sami languages) dating back 7,000 years. Steam baths have been part of European tradition elsewhere as well, but the sauna has survived best in Finland, in addition to Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Russia, Norway, and parts of the United States and Canada. Moreover, nearly all Finnish houses have either their own sauna or in multi-story apartment houses, a timeshare sauna. Municipal swimming halls and hotels have often their own saunas. The Finnish sauna culture is inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

=== Cuisine ===
Finnish cuisine generally combines traditional country fare and contemporary style cooking. Potato, meat and fish play a prominent role in traditional Finnish dishes. Finnish foods often use wholemeal products (rye, barley, oats) and berries (such as bilberries, lingonberries, cloudberries, and sea buckthorn). Milk and its derivatives like buttermilk are commonly used as food and drink. The most popular fish food in Finland is salmon.

Finland has the world&#x27;s second highest per capita consumption of coffee. Milk consumption is also high, at an average of about , per person, per year, even though 17% of the Finns are lactose intolerant.

=== Public holidays ===

There are several holidays in Finland, of which perhaps the most characteristic of Finnish culture include Christmas (&quot;joulu&quot;), Midsummer (&quot;juhannus&quot;), May Day (&quot;vappu&quot;) and Independence Day (&quot;itsenäisyyspäivä&quot;). Of these, Christmas and Midsummer are special in Finland because the actual festivities take place on eves, such as Christmas Eve and Midsummer&#x27;s Eve, while Christmas Day and Midsummer&#x27;s Day are more consecrated to rest. Other public holidays in Finland are New Year&#x27;s Day, Epiphany, Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday, Ascension Day, All Saints&#x27; Day and Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day. All official holidays in Finland are established by Acts of Parliament.

=== Sports ===

Various sporting events are popular in Finland. Pesäpallo, the Finnish equivalent of American baseball, is the national sport of Finland, although the most popular sport in terms of spectators is ice hockey. Other popular sports include athletics, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, football, volleyball, and basketball. Association football is the most played team sport in terms of the number of players in the country. Finland&#x27;s national basketball team has received widespread public attention.

In terms of medals and gold medals won per capita, Finland is the best-performing country in Olympic history. Finland first participated as a nation in its own right at the Olympic Games in 1908. At the 1912 Summer Olympics, three gold medals were won by the original &quot;Flying Finn&quot; Hannes Kolehmainen. In the 1920s and &#x27;30s, Finnish long-distance runners dominated the Olympics, with Paavo Nurmi winning a total of nine Olympic gold medals and setting 22 official world records between 1921 and 1931. Nurmi is often considered the greatest Finnish sportsman and one of the greatest athletes of all time. The 1952 Summer Olympics were held in Helsinki.

The javelin throw event has brought Finland nine Olympic gold medals, five world championships, five European championships, and 24 world records. Finland also has a notable history in figure skating. Finnish skaters have won 8 world championships and 13 junior world cups in synchronized skating.

Finnish competitors have achieved significant success in motorsport. In the World Rally Championship, Finland has produced eight world champions, more than any other country. In Formula One, Finland has won the most world championships per capita, with Keke Rosberg, Mika Häkkinen and Kimi Räikkönen all having won the title.

Some of the most popular recreational sports and activities include Nordic walking, running, cycling and skiing. Floorball is the most popular youth and workplace sport.

<text>A flagellate is a cell or organism with one or more whip-like appendages called flagella. The word &quot;flagellate&quot; also describes a particular construction (or level of organization) characteristic of many prokaryotes and eukaryotes and their means of motion. The term presently does not imply any specific relationship or classification of the organisms that possess flagella. However, several derivations of the term &quot;flagellate&quot; (such as &quot;dinoflagellate&quot; and &quot;choanoflagellata&quot;) are more formally characterized.

== Form and behavior ==
Flagella in eukaryotes are supported by microtubules in a characteristic arrangement, with nine fused pairs surrounding two central singlets. These arise from a basal body. In some flagellates, flagella direct food into a cytostome or mouth, where food is ingested. Flagella role in classifying eukaryotes.

Among protoctists and microscopic animals, a flagellate is an organism with one or more flagella. Some cells in other animals may be flagellate, for instance the spermatozoa of most animal phyla. Flowering plants do not produce flagellate cells, but ferns, mosses, green algae, and some gymnosperms and closely related plants do so. Likewise, most fungi do not produce cells with flagellae, but the primitive fungal chytrids do. Many protists take the form of single-celled flagellates.

Flagella are generally used for propulsion. They may also be used to create a current that brings in food. In most such organisms, one or more flagella are located at or near the anterior of the cell (e.g., &quot;Euglena&quot;). Often there is one directed forwards and one trailing behind. Many parasites that affect human health or economy are flagellates in at least one stage of life cycle, such as &quot;Naegleria&quot;, &quot;Trichomonas&quot; and &quot;Plasmodium&quot;. Flagellates are the major consumers of primary and secondary production in aquatic ecosystems - consuming bacteria and other protists.

== Flagellates as specialized cells or life cycle stages ==

An overview of the occurrence of flagellated cells in eukaryote groups, as specialized cells of multicellular organisms or as life cycle stages, is given below (see also the article flagellum):
* Archaeplastida: most green algae (zoospores and male gametes, except in Zygnematophyceae), bryophytes (male gametes), pteridophytes (male gametes), some gymnosperms (cycads and &quot;Ginkgo&quot;, as male gametes)
* Stramenopiles: centric diatoms (male gametes), brown algae (zoospores and gametes), oomycetes (assexual zoospores and gametes), hyphochytrids (zoospores), labyrinthulomycetes (zoospores), some chrysophytes, some xanthophytes, eustigmatophytes
* Alveolata: some apicomplexans (gametes)
* Rhizaria: some radiolarians (probably gametes), foraminiferans (as gametes)
** Cercozoa: plasmodiophoromycetes (zoospores and gametes), chlorarachniophytes (zoospores)
* Amoebozoa: myxogastrids
* Opisthokonta: most metazoans (male gametes, epithelia and choanocytes), chytrid fungi (zoospores and gametes)
* Excavata: some acrasids (&quot;Pocheina&quot;, as zoospores)

==Flagellates as organisms: the Flagellata==
In older classifications, flagellated protozoa were grouped in Flagellata (= Mastigophora), sometimes divided into Phytoflagellata (= Phytomastigina, mostly autotrophic) and Zooflagellata (= Zoomastigina, heterotrophic). They were sometimes grouped with Sarcodina (ameboids) in the group Sarcomastigophora.

The autotrophic flagellates were grouped similarly to the botanical schemes used for the corresponding algae groups. The colourless flagellates were customarily grouped in three groups, highly artificial:
* Protomastigineae, in which absorption of food-particles in holozoic nutrition occurs at a localised point of the cell surface, often at a cytostome, although many groups were merely saprophytes; it included the majority of colourless flagellates, and even many &quot;apochlorotic&quot; algae;
* Pantostomatineae (or Rhizomastigineae), in which the absorption takes place at any point on the cell surface; roughly corresponds to &quot;amoeboflagellates&quot;;
* Distomatineae, a group of binucleate &quot;double individuals&quot; with symmetrically distributed flagella and, in many species, two symmetrical mouths; roughly corresponds to current Diplomonadida.

Presently, these groups are known to be highly polyphyletic. In modern classifications of the protists, the principal flagellated taxa are placed in the following eukaryote groups, which include also non-flagellated forms (where &quot;A&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;P&quot; and &quot;S&quot; stands for autotrophic, free-living heterotrophic, parasitic and symbiotic, respectively):
* Archaeplastida: volvocids (A/F), prasinophytes (A), glaucophytes (A)
* Stramenopiles: bicosoecids (F), proteromonads (F), opalines (F), most chrysophytes (A/F), part of xanthophytes (A), raphidophytes/chloromonads (A), silicoflagellates (A), ciliophryids (F), pedinellids (A/F)
* Alveolata: dinoflagellates (A/F), &quot;Colpodella&quot; (F)
* Rhizaria
** Cercozoa: cercomonads (F), spongomonads (F), thaumatomonads (F), glissomonads (F), cryomonads (F), heliomonads/dimorphids (F), ebriids (F)
* Amoebozoa: &quot;Multicilia&quot; (F), phalansteriids (F), some archamoebae (F/S)
* Opisthokonta: choanoflagellates (F)
* Excavata
** Discoba: jakobids (F), kinetoplastids (bodonids, F/P, trypanosomatids, P), euglenids (F/A), some heteroloboseans (P/F/S)
** Metamonada: diplomonads (P/F), retortamonads (S), Preaxostyla/anaeromonads (oxymonads, S, &quot;Trimastix&quot;, F, &quot;Paratrimastix&quot;, F), parabasalids (trichomonads, P/S, hypermastigids, S)
* Eukaryota incertae sedis : haptophytes (F/A), cryptophytes (F/A), kathablepharids (F), Apusozoa (apusomondas, F, ancyromonads, F, spironemids/hemimastigids, F), collodictyonids/diphylleids (F), &quot;Phyllomonas&quot; (F), and about a hundred genera

Although the taxonomic group Flagellata was abandoned, the term &quot;flagellate&quot; is still used as the description of a level of organization and also as an ecological functional group. Another term used is &quot;monadoid&quot;, from monad. as in &quot;Monas&quot;, and &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; and in the groups as listed above.

The amoeboflagellates (e.g., the rhizarian genus &quot;Cercomonas&quot;, some amoebozoan Archamoebae, some excavate Heterolobosea) have a peculiar type of flagellate/amoeboid organization, in which cells may present flagella and pseudopods, simultaneously or sequentially, while the helioflagellates (e.g., the cercozoan heliomonads/dimorphids, the stramenopile pedinellids and ciliophryids) have a flagellate/heliozoan organization.

<doc id="10591" wikidata="Q4173974" url="?curid=10591" title="Flavoring">
<text>A flavoring (or flavouring), also known as flavor (or flavour) or flavorant, is a food additive used to improve the taste or smell of food. It changes the perceptual impression of food as determined primarily by the chemoreceptors of the gustatory and olfactory systems. Along with additives, other components like sugars determine the taste of food. 

A flavoring is defined as a substance that gives another substance taste, altering the characteristics of the solute, causing it to become sweet, sour, tangy, etc. Although the term, in common language, denotes the combined chemical sensations of taste and smell, the same term is used in the fragrance and flavors industry to refer to edible chemicals and extracts that alter the flavor of food and food products through the sense of smell.

Owing to the high cost, or unavailability of natural flavor extracts, most commercial flavorings are &quot;nature-identical&quot;, which means that they are the chemical equivalent of natural flavors, but chemically synthesized rather than being extracted from source materials. Identification of components of natural foods, for example a raspberry, may be done using technology such as headspace techniques, so the flavorist can imitate the flavor by using a few of the same chemicals present. In the EU legislation, the term &quot;natural-identical flavoring&quot; does not exist. The legislation is specified on what is a &quot;flavoring&quot; and a &quot;natural flavoring&quot;.

== Definition ==
A flavoring is a volatile additive that improves the taste or smell of food. They work primarily via the sense of smell. In legislation, substances that exclusively have a sweet, sour or salty taste are not considered flavorings. These usually include flavor enhancers, sweeteners, acidulants and salt substitutes. 

There are different ways to divide flavorings. First by the way they are produced. A vanilla flavoring can for example be obtained naturally by extraction from vanilla seeds, or one can start with cheap chemicals and try to make a similar substance artificially (in this example vanillin). A nature-identical flavoring is chemically an exact copy of the original substance and can be either natural or artificial. Vanillin is not obtained from the vanilla plant nor an exact copy of vanilla, but a synthesized nature-identical component of the vanilla aroma. Vanillin is not vanilla, but gives a food a vanilla aroma.

The second division is by the effect they have on smell (aroma) or taste of the food. The effect can be the aroma of a specific fruit, almond, butter, smoke from wood, or some fantasy flavor. The aroma of the flavoring may resemble that of the source, or imitate a particular unrelated food. It may for example be the extract from vanilla seeds and smell like vanilla, or it may be the extract of a potato and smell like a banana. Irrespective of the effect, the flavoring may be natural or artificial. It may for example be the natural tissue of an animal with the aroma of a citrus, or just a chemical that smells like a citrus.

==Division by production method==
Flavorings can be divided into three principal types: &quot;natural flavorings&quot;, &quot;nature-identical flavorings&quot;, and &quot;artificial flavorings&quot;. In the United States, they are traditionally divided into natural and artificial flavorings, where the latter includes nature-identical flavorings. In contrast, European legislation does not distinguish natural and nature-identical flavorings, while only the term &quot;natural&quot; is subject to some regulation.

=== Natural flavorings ===
Natural flavorings are edible aroma compounds that are found in nature, not made by man.
In nature, they always occur with other natural substances that also may be flavorings. Natural flavorings can be isolated on industrial scale, to be used as an additive.

Techniques to obtain natural flavorings include the use of enzymes and/or micro organisms. European legislators have accepted flavorings produced by manmade genetically modified organisms (GMOs) – not found in nature – as natural flavorings.

=== Nature-identical flavorings ===
Nature-identical flavorings are human-made aroma compounds that are chemically identical to some substance that can be found in nature. They are synthesized from chemicals or isolated by means of chemical processes.

Because nature-identical flavorings can be produced at low costs, the food industry will argue that nature-identical and natural flavorings are exactly the same. They have the advantage to be chemically pure, without allergens that may be coupled with natural flavorings. On the other hand, they are missing the synergy of other substances present in their natural origin, so they may lack subtlety.

=== Artificial flavorings ===
Artificial flavorings are synthesized from chemical substances by man and are not found in nature. Their sensory characteristics mostly resemble that of natural or nature-identical flavorings.

== Perception of flavorings ==
Of the three chemical senses, smell is the main determinant of a food item&#x27;s flavor. Aromas are the volatile components of the food. The aroma is determined by the aroma compounds it contains and the personal ability to detect them. While a flavoring primarily acts through the olfactory system, it also affects the taste at the same time. 

Along with additives, other components like sugars determine the taste of food. The trigeminal nerves, which detect chemical irritants in the mouth and throat, as well as temperature and texture, are also important to the overall perception of food.

== Mechanism ==
Flavors from food products are usually the result of a combination of natural flavors, which set up the basic smell profile of a food product, while artificial flavors modify the smell to accent it.

Unlike smelling, which occurs upon inhalation, the sensing of flavors in the mouth occurs in the exhalation phase of breathing and is perceived differently by an individual. In other words, the smell of food is different depending on whether one is smelling it before or after it has entered one&#x27;s mouth.

==Taste==
The taste of a food product is not only determined by the aromas present in the original material and added flavorings, but also by accompanying substances like flavor enhancers, sweeteners, acidulants and salt substitutes. Polyols like sorbitol and maltitol, are carriers in flavorings, but they themselves also have a sweet taste.

Even the color of food can affect one&#x27;s experience of the taste significantly.
In one study, adding more red color to a drink increased the perceived sweetness, with darker colored solutions being rated 2–10% better than lighter ones, though it had 1% less sucrose concentration. Food manufacturers exploit this phenomenon; for example, different colors of the U.S. product Froot Loops cereal and most brands of Gummy Bears often use the same flavorings.

=== Flavor enhancers ===

Flavor enhancers or taste enhancers, which are umami or &quot;savory&quot; compounds, are themselves not flavorings, but they intensify the taste of the food. They are largely based on amino acids and nucleotides. These are typically used as sodium or calcium salts. Umami flavorings recognized and approved by the European Union include:

==Regulations==
=== In Europe ===
Under the EU legislation, substances which have exclusively a sweet, sour or salty taste are not considered flavorings (Article 2, Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;regulation_1334/2008&quot;&gt;&quot;Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties for use in and on foods and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91, Regulations (EC) No 2232/96 and (EC) No 110/2008 and Directive 2000/13/EC&quot; (consolidated version of 24 November 2021). The preamble is reproduced here &lt;/ref&gt;

Also flavor enhancers are not considered flavorings under the EU legislation but additives (Point 14 of Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008).&lt;ref name=&quot;regulation_1333/2008&quot;&gt;&quot;Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on food additives&quot; (consolidated version of 8 August 2021). The preamble is reproduced here &lt;/ref&gt;

EU legislation defines several types of flavorings:
*flavoring substances (including &quot;natural flavoring substances&quot;): 
*flavoring preparations (by definition always natural): 
*thermal process flavorings
*smoke flavorings
*flavor precursors
*other flavorings

In the EU, Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 on flavorings and certain food ingredients with flavoring properties for use in/on foods, i.e. the EU Flavouring Regulation, was adopted on 16 December 2008 and entered into force on 20 January 2009. It applies from 20 January 2011.
Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 lays down general requirements for safe use of flavorings and provides definitions for different types of flavorings. The Regulation sets out substances for which an evaluation and approval is required. The Union list of flavoring substances, approved for use in and on foods, was adopted on 1 October 2012 and was introduced in Annex I of this Regulation

==== In the UK ====
The UK followed the above EU legislation which remained in force until 31 December 2020. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 provided that from 1 January 2021, this directly applicable EU legislation was converted into UK law with minor corrections to enable it to operate effectively as UK law. These corrections were made by Statutory Instrument 2019 No. 860.

The UK Food industry, in collaboration with the flavoring industry, has developed guidance on what to consider when declaring a pictorial representation of a food ingredient on the label of a pre-packed product.

=== In the United States ===
In the United States, flavorings are regulated in &quot;Title 21&quot; of the Code of Federal Regulations. They are divided into artificial and natural flavorings.

=== In Australia and New Zealand ===
In Australia and New Zealand regulation of flavorings is covered by the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code of November 2000, entered into force in December 2002.

Natural flavorings are obtained from plant or animal raw materials, by physical, microbiological, or enzymatic processes. They can be either used in their natural state or processed for human consumption, but cannot contain any nature-identical or artificial flavoring substances.

Nature-identical flavorings are obtained by synthesis or isolated through chemical processes, which are chemically and organoleptically identical to flavoring substances naturally present in products intended for human consumption. They cannot contain any artificial flavoring substances.

Artificial flavorings are &quot;flavouring substances not identified in a natural product intended for human consumption, whether or not the product is processed.&quot;

===Regulations on natural flavoring===

In the EU, in order to be labeled as natural flavoring substance, many conditions have to be fulfilled: &quot;Natural flavouring substance&quot; shall mean a flavoring substance obtained by appropriate physical, enzymatic or microbiological processes from material of vegetable, animal or microbiological origin either in the raw state or after processing for human consumption by one or more of the traditional food preparation processes listed in Annex II. Natural flavoring substances correspond to substances that are naturally present and have been identified in nature (Article 3).

More detailed information on the Production of Natural Flavouring Substances and (Natural) Flavouring Preparations can be found on the European Flavour Association (EFFA) Guidance Document.

UK Food Law defines a natural flavor as:

The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations describes a &quot;natural flavoring&quot; as:
==Dietary restrictions==
Food manufacturers are sometimes reluctant to inform consumers about the source and identity of flavor ingredients and whether they have been produced with the incorporation of substances such as animal byproducts. Some flavor ingredients, such as gelatin, are produced from animal products. Some, such as glycerin, can be derived from either animal or vegetable sources. And some extracts, such as vanilla, may contain alcohol. Many groups such as Jews, Jains, Hindus, and Muslims, as well as vegans follow dietary restrictions which disallow the use of animal byproducts and/or alcohol in certain contexts. In many Western countries, some consumers rely on a Jewish kosher pareve certification mark to indicate that natural flavorings used in a food product are free of meat and dairy (although they can still contain fish). The Vegan Society&#x27;s Sunflower symbol (which is currently used by over 260 companies worldwide) can also be used to see which products do not use any animal ingredients (including flavorings and colorings).

Similarly, persons with known sensitivities or allergies to food products are advised to avoid foods that contain generic &quot;natural flavors&quot; or to first determine the source of the flavoring before consuming the food. Such flavors may be derived from a variety of source products that are themselves common allergens, such as dairy, soy, sesame, eggs, and nuts.
In the EU, nevertheless, this information is available in the labeling. Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers, states in article 9 that any ingredient or processing aid listed in Annex II (of the aforementioned Regulation) or derived from a substance or product listed in Annex II causing allergies or intolerances used in the manufacture or preparation of a food and still present in the finished product, even if in an altered form must be included in the labeling.

==Flavor creation==

Most artificial flavors are specific and often complex mixtures of singular naturally occurring flavor compounds combined to either imitate or enhance a natural flavor. These mixtures are formulated by flavorists to give a food product a unique flavor and to maintain flavor consistency between different product batches or after recipe changes. The list of known flavoring agents includes thousands of molecular compounds, and flavor chemists (flavorists) can often mix these together to produce many of the common flavors. Many flavorings consist of esters, which are often described as being sweet or fruity.

The compounds used to produce artificial flavors are almost identical to those that occur naturally. It has been suggested that artificial flavors may be safer to consume than natural flavors due to the standards of purity and mixture consistency that are enforced either by the company or by law. Natural flavors, in contrast, may contain impurities from their sources, while artificial flavors are typically more pure and are required to undergo more testing before being sold for consumption.

Food and beverage companies may require flavors for new products, product line extensions (e.g., low fat versions of existing products), or changes in formula or processing for existing products. In 2011, about US$10.6 billion were generated with the sale of flavors; the majority of the flavors used are consumed in ultra-processed food and convenience food.

The number of food smells is unbounded; a food&#x27;s flavor, therefore, can be easily altered by changing its smell while keeping its taste similar. This is exemplified in artificially flavored jellies, soft drinks and candies, which, while made of bases with a similar taste, have dramatically different flavors due to the use of different scents or fragrances.

Most flavors represent a mixture of aroma compounds, the raw material that is produced by flavor companies. In rare cases, a single synthetic compound is used in pure form. Artificial vanilla flavors vanillin and ethylvanillin are a notable exception, as well as the artificial strawberry flavor (ethyl methylphenylglycidate). The ubiquitous &quot;green apple&quot; aroma is based on hexyl acetate.


Some flavors are relatively multifaceted. For example, the basic aroma of cooked meat is formed by a combination of Maillard reaction, lipid peroxidation, and degradation of sulfur-containing compounds such as thiamine and cysteine. With this understanding, an artificial chicken flavor can be made from ingredients as simple as glucose, salt, cysteine, and arachidonic acid: when heated in a water solution they undergo these three reactions to produce the desired flavor. (Such a flavor produced during the preparation process from precursor compounds is called a &quot;process flavor&quot;). Small tweaks to the mixture can instead produce a beef flavor. This kind of basic meat flavoring has been known since the 1970s. Of course, these four chemicals only mimic a small number of possible reactions out of the many reactions possible among the complex flavor precursor chemicals found in meat. For a more realistically complex aroma, natural feedstocks such as yeast extract, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, and spices can be used to expand the number of possible reactions. They also contribute peptides, free amino acids, and nucleic acid metabolites that all play a role in the natural taste of meat.

==Determination==
Few standards are available or being prepared for sensory analysis of flavors. In chemical analysis of flavors, solid phase extraction, solid phase microextraction, and headspace gas chromatography are applied to extract and separate the flavor compounds in the sample. The determination is typically done by various mass spectrometric techniques. A flavor lexicon can aid the development of objective language for food.

<text>The Frisian languages ( or ) are a closely related group of West Germanic languages, spoken by about 400,000 Frisian people, who live on the southern fringes of the North Sea in the Netherlands and Germany. The Frisian languages are the closest living language group to the Anglic languages; the two groups make up the Anglo-Frisian languages group and together with the Low German dialects these form the North Sea Germanic languages. However, modern English and Frisian are not mutually intelligible, nor are Frisian languages intelligible among themselves, owing to independent linguistic innovations and language contact with neighboring languages.

There are three different branches of Frisian, which are usually called &quot;Frisian languages&quot;, despite the fact that dialects within those branches may not be mutually intelligible. West Frisian is by far the most spoken of the three and is an official language in the Dutch province of Friesland, where it is spoken on the mainland and on two of the West Frisian Islands: Terschelling and Schiermonnikoog. It is also spoken in four villages in the Westerkwartier of the neighbouring province of Groningen. North Frisian, the second branch, is spoken in the northernmost German district of Nordfriesland in the state of Schleswig-Holstein, on the North Frisian mainland, and on the North Frisian Islands of Sylt, Föhr, Amrum, and the Halligs. It is also spoken on the islands of Heligoland (&quot;deät Lun&quot;) and Düne (&quot;de Halem&quot;) in the North Sea. The third Frisian branch, East Frisian, has only one remaining variant, Sater Frisian, spoken in the municipality of Saterland in the Lower Saxon district of Cloppenburg. Surrounded by bogs, the four Saterlandic villages lie just outside the borders of East Frisia, in the Oldenburg Münsterland region. In East Frisia proper, East Frisian Low Saxon is spoken today, which is not a Frisian language, but a variant of Low German/Low Saxon.

Depending upon their location, the Frisian languages have been heavily influenced by and bear similarities to Dutch and Low German/Low Saxon, and in addition North Frisian has a Danish substrate. However, Frisian is still unintelligible to Dutch; a cloze test in 2005 revealed that Dutch respondents understood 31.9% of a West Frisian newspaper, 66.4% of an Afrikaans newspaper and 97.1% of a Dutch newspaper. Additional shared linguistic characteristics between Friesland and the Great Yarmouth area in England are likely to have resulted from the close trading relationship these areas maintained during the centuries-long Hanseatic League of the Late Middle Ages.

==Division==
There are three main groups of Frisian varieties: West Frisian, Saterland Frisian, and North Frisian. Some linguists consider these three varieties, despite their mutual unintelligibility, to be dialects of one single Frisian language, whereas others consider them to be a number of separate languages equal to or greater than the number of main branches discussed here. Indeed, the insular varieties of West Frisian are not intelligible to the mainland, and by that standard are additional languages, and North Frisian is also divided into several strongly diverse dialects, which are not all mutually intelligible among themselves. West Frisian is strongly influenced by Dutch. The other Frisian languages, meanwhile, have been influenced by Low German and German. Stadsfries and West Frisian Dutch are not Frisian, but Dutch dialects influenced by West Frisian. Frisian is called &quot;Frysk&quot; in West Frisian, &quot;Fräisk&quot; in Saterland Frisian, and &quot;Friisk&quot;, &quot;fresk&quot;, &quot;freesk&quot;, &quot;frasch&quot;, &quot;fräisch&quot;, and &quot;freesch&quot; in the varieties of North Frisian.

The situation in the Dutch province of Groningen and the German region of East Frisia is similar: The local Low German/Low Saxon dialects of Gronings and East Frisian Low Saxon still bear some Frisian elements due to East Frisian substrate. Frisian was spoken there at one time, only to have been gradually replaced by Low Saxon since the Middle Ages. This local language is now, like Frisian, under threat by standard Dutch and German.
===Speakers===
Most Frisian speakers live in the Netherlands, primarily in the province of Friesland, which since 1997 officially uses its West Frisian name of Fryslân, where the number of native speakers is about 400,000, which is about 75% of the inhabitants of Friesland. An increasing number of native Dutch speakers in the province are learning Frisian as a second language.

In Germany, there are about 2,000 speakers of Saterland Frisian in the marshy Saterland region of Lower Saxony. Saterland Frisian has resisted encroachment from Low German and Standard German, but Saterland Frisian still remains seriously endangered because of the small size of the speech community and of the lack of institutional support to help preserve and spread the language.

In the North Frisia (&quot;Nordfriesland&quot;) region of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, there were 10,000 North Frisian speakers. Although many of these live on the mainland, most are found on the islands, notably Sylt, Föhr, Amrum, and Heligoland. The local corresponding North Frisian dialects are still in use.

West Frisian-Dutch bilinguals are split into two categories: Speakers who had Dutch as their first language tended to maintain the Dutch system of homophony between plural and linking suffixes when speaking West Frisian, by using the West Frisian plural as a linking morpheme. Speakers who had West Frisian as their first language often maintained the West Frisian system of no homophony when speaking West Frisian.

===Status===
Saterland and North Frisian are officially recognised and protected as minority languages in Germany, and West Frisian is one of the two official languages in the Netherlands, the other being Dutch.
ISO 639-1 code codice_1 and ISO 639-2 code codice_2 were assigned to &quot;Frisian&quot;, but that was changed in November 2005 to &quot;Western Frisian&quot;. According to the ISO 639 Registration Authority the &quot;previous usage of [this] code has been for Western Frisian, although [the] language name was &#x27;Frisian.

The new ISO 639 code codice_3 is used for the Saterland Frisian language, a variety of Eastern Frisian (not to be confused with East Frisian Low Saxon, a West Low German dialect). The new ISO 639 code codice_4 is used for the North Frisian language variants spoken in parts of Schleswig-Holstein.

The Ried fan de Fryske Beweging is an organization which works for the preservation of the West Frisian language and culture in the Dutch province of Friesland. The Fryske Academy also plays a large role, since its foundation in 1938, to conduct research on Frisian language, history, and society, including attempts at forming a larger dictionary. Recent attempts have allowed Frisian be used somewhat more in some of the domains of education, media and public administration. Nevertheless, Saterland Frisian and most dialects of North Frisian are seriously endangered and West Frisian is considered as vulnerable to being endangered. Moreover, for all advances in integrating Frisian in daily life, there is still a lack of education and media awareness of the Frisian language, perhaps reflecting its rural origins and its lack of prestige Therefore, in a sociological sense it is considered more a dialect than a standard language, even though linguistically it is a separate language.

For L2 speakers, both the quality and amount of time Frisian is taught in the classroom is low, concluding that Frisian lessons do not contribute meaningfully to the linguistic and cultural development of the students. Moreover, Frisian runs the risk of dissolving into Dutch, especially in Friesland, where both languages are used.

==History==
===Old Frisian===

In the Early Middle Ages the Frisian lands stretched from the area around Bruges, in what is now Belgium, to the river Weser, in northern Germany. At that time, the Frisian language was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast. Today this region is sometimes referred to as Great Frisia or Frisia Magna, and many of the areas within it still treasure their Frisian heritage, even though in most places the Frisian languages have been lost.

Frisian is the language most closely related to English and Scots, but after at least five hundred years of being subject to the influence of Dutch, modern Frisian in some aspects bears a greater similarity to Dutch than to English; one must also take into account the centuries-long drift of English away from Frisian. Thus the two languages have become less mutually intelligible over time, partly due to the influence which Dutch and Low German have had on Frisian, and partly due to the vast influence some languages (in particular Norman French) have had on English throughout the centuries.

Old Frisian, however, was very similar to Old English. Historically, both English and Frisian are marked by the loss of the Germanic nasal in words like &quot;us&quot; (&quot;ús&quot;; &quot;uns&quot; in German), &quot;soft&quot; (&quot;sêft&quot;; &quot;sanft&quot;) or &quot;goose&quot; (&quot;goes&quot;; &quot;Gans&quot;): see Anglo-Frisian nasal spirant law. Also, when followed by some vowels, the Germanic &quot;k&quot; softened to a &quot;ch&quot; sound; for example, the Frisian for &quot;cheese&quot; and &quot;church&quot; is &quot;tsiis&quot; and &quot;tsjerke&quot;, whereas in Dutch it is &quot;kaas&quot; and &quot;kerk&quot;, and in High German the respective words are &quot;Käse&quot; and &quot;Kirche&quot;. Contrarily, this did not happen for &quot;chin&quot; and &quot;choose&quot;, which are &quot;kin&quot; and &quot;kieze&quot;.

One rhyme demonstrates the palpable similarity between Frisian and English: &quot;Butter, bread and green cheese is good English and good Frisian,&quot; which is pronounced more or less the same in both languages (West Frisian: &quot;Bûter, brea en griene tsiis is goed Ingelsk en goed Frysk.&quot;)

One major difference between Old Frisian and modern Frisian is that in the Old Frisian period () grammatical cases still existed. Some of the texts that are preserved from this period are from the 12th or 13th, but most are from the 14th and 15th centuries. Generally, all these texts are restricted to legalistic writings. Although the earliest definite written examples of Frisian are from approximately the 9th century, there are a few examples of runic inscriptions from the region which are probably older and possibly in the Frisian language. These runic writings however usually do not amount to more than single- or few-word inscriptions, and cannot be said to constitute literature as such. The transition from the Old Frisian to the Middle Frisian period (c.1550-c.1820) in the 16th century is based on the fairly abrupt halt in the use of Frisian as a written language.

Up until the 15th century, Frisian was a language widely spoken and written, but from 1500 onwards it became an almost exclusively oral language, mainly used in rural areas. This was in part due to the occupation of its stronghold, the Dutch province of Friesland (Fryslân), in 1498, by Albert III, Duke of Saxony, who replaced West Frisian as the language of government with Dutch.

Afterwards this practice was continued under the Habsburg rulers of the Netherlands (the German Emperor Charles V and his son, the Spanish King Philip II), and even when the Netherlands became independent, in 1585, West Frisian did not regain its former status. The reason for this was the rise of Holland as the dominant part of the Netherlands, and its language, Dutch, as the dominant language in judicial, administrative and religious affairs.

In this period the great Frisian poet Gysbert Japiks (1603–66), a schoolteacher and cantor from the city of Bolsward, who largely fathered modern West Frisian literature and orthography, was really an exception to the rule.

His example was not followed until the 19th century, when entire generations of West Frisian authors and poets appeared. This coincided with the introduction of the so-called newer breaking system, a prominent grammatical feature in almost all West Frisian dialects, with the notable exception of Southwest Frisian. Therefore, the Modern West Frisian period is considered to have begun at this point in time, around 1820.

=== Modern West Frisian ===

The revival of the West Frisian Language was led by the poet Gysbert Japiks, who had begun to write in the language as a way to show that it was possible, and created a collective West Frisian identity and West Frisian standard of writing through his poetry. Later on, Johannes Hilarides would build off Gysbert Japiks&#x27; work by building on West Frisian orthography, particularly on its pronunciation; he also, unlike Japiks, set a standard of the West Frisian language that focused more heavily on how the common people used it as an everyday language.

Perhaps the most important figure in the spreading of the West Frisian language was minister Joost. H. Halbertsma (1789–1869), who translated many works into the West Frisian language, such as the New Testament He had however, like Hilarides, focused mostly on the vernacular of the West Frisian language, where he focused on translating texts, plays and songs for the lower and middle classes in order to teach and expand the West Frisian language. The compiled literary work of the Halbertsma brothers (Joost, Tjalling, and Eeltje), Rimen en Teltsjes, is regarded as the standard Frisian literary work. This had begun the effort to continuously preserve the West Frisian language, which continues unto this day. It was however not until the first half of the 20th century that the West Frisian revival movement began to gain strength, not only through its language, but also through its culture and history, supporting singing and acting in West Frisian in order to facilitate West Frisian speaking. 

It was not until 1960 that Dutch began to dominate West Frisian in Friesland; with many non-Frisian immigrants into Friesland, the language gradually began to diminish, and survives now only due to the constant effort of scholars and organisations. In recent years, it has been the province of Friesland, rather than the language itself, that has become a more important part of the West Frisian identity; as such, the language has become less important for cultural preservation purposes. It is especially written West Frisian that seems to have trouble surviving, with only 30% of the West Frisian population competent in it; it went out of use in the 16th century and continues to be barely taught today.

==Family tree==

Frisian languages belong to the West Germanic branch of the Indo-European languages, the most widespread language family in Europe and the world. Its closest living genealogical relatives are the Anglic languages, i.e. English and Scots (Anglo-Frisian languages); together with the also closely related Low Saxon dialects the two groups make up the group of North Sea Germanic languages.

<text>French ( or ) is a Romance language of the Indo-European family. Like all other Romance languages, it descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire. French evolved from Old Gallo-Romance, a descendant of the Latin spoken in Gaul, more specifically Northern Gaul. Its closest relatives are the other langues d&#x27;oïl—languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium, which French (Francien) largely supplanted. It was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul and by the Germanic Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders. As a result of French and Belgian colonialism from the 16th century onward, it was introduced to new territories in the Americas, Africa, and Asia, and numerous French-based creole languages, most notably Haitian Creole, were established. A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French.

French is an official language in 27 countries, as well as one of the most geographically widespread languages in the world, with about 50 countries and territories having it as a &quot;de jure&quot; or &quot;de facto&quot; official, administrative, or cultural language. Most of these countries are members of the (OIF), the community of 54 member states which share the official use or teaching of French. It is estimated to have about 310 million speakers, of which about 80 million are native speakers; it is spoken as a first language (in descending order of the number of speakers) in France, Canada (provinces of Quebec, Ontario, and New Brunswick), Belgium (Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region), western Switzerland (Romandy region), parts of Luxembourg, parts of the United States (Louisiana, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont), Monaco, the Aosta Valley region of Italy, and various communities elsewhere.

In Francophone Africa it is spoken mainly as a second language or lingua franca, though it has also become a native language in a small number of urban areas; in some North African countries, despite not having official status, it is also a first language among some upper classes of the population alongside the indigenous ones, but only a second one among the general population.

In 2015, approximately 40% of the Francophone population (including L2 and partial speakers) lived in Europe, 36% in sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian Ocean, 15% in North Africa and the Middle East, 8% in the Americas, and 1% in Asia and Oceania. French is the second most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union. Of Europeans who speak other languages natively, approximately one-fifth are able to speak French as a second language. Many institutions of the EU use French as a working language along with English, German and Italian; in some institutions, French is the sole working language (e.g. at the Court of Justice of the European Union). French is also the 16th most natively spoken language in the world, the sixth most spoken language by total number of speakers, and is among the top five most studied languages worldwide, with about 120 million learners as of 2017. French has a long history as an international language of literature and scientific standards and is a primary or second language of many international organisations including the United Nations, the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the World Trade Organization, the International Olympic Committee, the General Conference on Weights and Measures, and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

== History ==

French is a Romance language (meaning that it is descended primarily from Vulgar Latin) that evolved out of the Gallo-Romance dialects spoken in northern France. The language&#x27;s early forms include Old French and Middle French.

=== Vulgar Latin in Gaul ===
Due to Roman rule, Latin was gradually adopted by the inhabitants of Gaul. As the language was learned by the common people, it developed a distinct local character, with grammatical differences from Latin as spoken elsewhere, some of which is attested in graffiti. This local variety evolved into the Gallo-Romance tongues, which include French and its closest relatives, such as Arpitan.

The evolution of Latin in Gaul was shaped by its coexistence for over half a millennium beside the native Celtic Gaulish language, which did not go extinct until the late sixth century, long after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Because few Latin speakers settled in rural areas during Roman times, Latin there held little or no social value for the landed gentry and peasantry; as a result, 90% of the total population of Gaul remained indigenous in origin. The urban aristocracy, who used Latin for trade, education or official uses, would send their children to Roman schools and administered lands for Rome. In the fifth century, at the time of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the vast majority of the (predominantly rural) population remained Gaulish speakers. They would shift to Latin as their native speech only one century after the Frankish conquest of Gaul, as both they and the new Frankish ruling elite adopted the prestige language of their urban literate elite. This eventual spread of Latin can be attributed to the social migration from the focus of urban power to village-centred economies and legal serfdom.

The Gaulish language likely survived into the sixth century in France despite considerable Romanization. Coexisting with Latin, Gaulish helped shape the Vulgar Latin dialects that developed into French contributing loanwords and calques (including , the word for &quot;yes&quot;), sound changes shaped by Gaulish influence, and influences in conjugation and word order. Recent computational studies suggest that early gender shifts may have been motivated by the gender of the corresponding word in Gaulish.

The estimated number of French words that can be attributed to Gaulish is placed at 154 by the &quot;Petit Robert&quot;, which is often viewed as representing standardized French, while if non-standard dialects are included, the number increases to 240. Known Gaulish loans are skewed toward certain semantic fields, such as plant life (&quot;chêne&quot;, &quot;bille&quot;, etc.), animals (&quot;mouton&quot;, &quot;cheval&quot;, etc.), nature (&quot;boue&quot;, etc.), domestic activities (ex. &quot;berceau&quot;), farming and rural units of measure (&quot;arpent&quot;, &quot;lieue&quot;, &quot;borne&quot;, &quot;boisseau&quot;), weapons, and products traded regionally rather than further afield. This semantic distribution has been attributed to peasants being the last to hold onto Gaulish.

=== Old French ===
The beginning of French in Gaul was greatly influenced by Germanic invasions into the country. These invasions had the greatest impact on the northern part of the country and on the language there. A language divide began to grow across the country. The population in the north spoke while the population in the south spoke . Langue d&#x27;oïl grew into what is known as Old French. The period of Old French spanned between the late 8th and mid-14th centuries. Old French shared many characteristics with Latin. For example, Old French made use of different possible word orders just as Latin did because it had a case system that retained the difference between nominative subjects and oblique non-subjects. The period is marked by a heavy superstrate influence from the Germanic Frankish language, which non-exhaustively included the use in upper-class speech and higher registers of V2 word order, a large percentage of the vocabulary (now at around 15% of modern French vocabulary) including the impersonal singular pronoun &quot;on&quot; (a calque of Germanic &quot;man&quot;), and the name of the language itself.

Up until its later stages, Old French, alongside Old Occitan, maintained a relic of the old nominal case system of Latin longer than most other Romance languages (with the notable exception of Romanian which still currently maintains a case distinction), differentiating between an oblique case and a nominative case. The phonology was characterized by heavy syllabic stress, which led to the emergence of various complicated diphthongs such as &quot;-eau&quot; which would later be leveled to monophthongs.

The earliest evidence of what became Old French can be seen in the Oaths of Strasbourg and the &quot;Sequence of Saint Eulalia&quot;, while Old French literature began to be produced in the eleventh century, with major early works often focusing on the lives of saints (such as the &quot;Vie de Saint Alexis&quot;), or wars and royal courts, notably including the &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot;, epic cycles focused on King Arthur and his court, as well as a cycle focused on William of Orange.

It was during the period of the Crusades in which French became so dominant in the Mediterranean Sea that became a &quot;lingua franca&quot; (&quot;Frankish language&quot;), and because of increased contact with the Arabs during the Crusades who referred to them as &quot;Franj&quot;, numerous Arabic loanwords entered French, such as &quot;amiral&quot; (admiral), &quot;alcool&quot; (alcohol), &quot;coton&quot; (cotton) and &quot;sirop&quot; (syrop), as well as scientific terms such as &quot;algébre&quot; (algebra), &quot;alchimie&quot; (alchemy) and &quot;zéro&quot; (zero).

=== Middle French ===

Within Old French many dialects emerged but the Francien dialect is one that not only continued but also thrived during the Middle French period (14th–17th centuries). Modern French grew out of this Francien dialect. Grammatically, during the period of Middle French, noun declensions were lost and there began to be standardized rules. Robert Estienne published the first Latin-French dictionary, which included information about phonetics, etymology, and grammar. Politically, the first government authority to adopt Modern French as official was the Aosta Valley in 1536, while the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts (1539) named French the language of law in the Kingdom of France.

=== Modern French ===
During the 17th century, French replaced Latin as the most important language of diplomacy and international relations (lingua franca). It retained this role until approximately the middle of the 20th century, when it was replaced by English as the United States became the dominant global power following the Second World War. Stanley Meisler of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that the fact that the Treaty of Versailles was written in English as well as French was the &quot;first diplomatic blow&quot; against the language.

During the Grand Siècle (17th century), France, under the rule of powerful leaders such as Cardinal Richelieu and Louis XIV, enjoyed a period of prosperity and prominence among European nations. Richelieu established the to protect the French language. By the early 1800s, Parisian French had become the primary language of the aristocracy in France.

Near the beginning of the 19th century, the French government began to pursue policies with the end goal of eradicating the many minorities and regional languages (&quot;patois&quot;) spoken in France. This began in 1794 with Henri Grégoire&#x27;s &quot;Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalize the use of the French language&quot;. When public education was made compulsory, only French was taught and the use of any other (&quot;patois&quot;) language was punished. The goals of the public school system were made especially clear to the French-speaking teachers sent to teach students in regions such as Occitania and Brittany. Instructions given by a French official to teachers in the department of Finistère, in western Brittany, included the following: &quot;And remember, Gents: you were given your position in order to kill the Breton language&quot;. The prefect of Basses-Pyrénées in the French Basque Country wrote in 1846: &quot;Our schools in the Basque Country are particularly meant to replace the Basque language with French...&quot; Students were taught that their ancestral languages were inferior and they should be ashamed of them; this process was known in the Occitan-speaking region as Vergonha.

== Geographic distribution ==

=== Europe ===
Spoken by 19.71% of the European Union&#x27;s population, French is the third most widely spoken language in the EU, after English and German and the second-most-widely taught language after English.

Under the Constitution of France, French has been the official language of the Republic since 1992, although the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts made it mandatory for legal documents in 1539. France mandates the use of French in official government publications, public education except in specific cases, and legal contracts; advertisements must bear a translation of foreign words.

In Belgium, French is an official language at the federal level along with Dutch and German. At the regional level, French is the sole official language of Wallonia (excluding a part of the East Cantons, which are German-speaking) and one of the two official languages—along with Dutch—of the Brussels-Capital Region, where it is spoken by the majority of the population (approx. 80%), often as their primary language.

French is one of the four official languages of Switzerland, along with German, Italian, and Romansh, and is spoken in the western part of Switzerland, called Romandy, of which Geneva is the largest city. The language divisions in Switzerland do not coincide with political subdivisions, and some cantons have bilingual status: for example, cities such as Biel/Bienne and cantons such as Valais, Fribourg and Bern. French is the native language of about 23% of the Swiss population, and is spoken by 50% of the population.

Along with Luxembourgish and German, French is one of the three official languages of Luxembourg, where it is generally the preferred language of business as well as of the different public administrations. It is also the official language of Monaco.

At a regional level, French is acknowledged as an official language in the Aosta Valley region of Italy (the first government authority to adopt Modern French as the official language in 1536, three years before France itself), in which is spoken as a first language by 1.25% of the population and as a second one by approximately 50%. French dialects remain spoken by minorities on the Channel Islands; it is also spoken in Andorra and is the main language after Catalan in El Pas de la Casa. The language is taught as the primary second language in the German state of Saarland, with French being taught from pre-school and over 43% of citizens being able to speak French.
=== Africa ===

The majority of the world&#x27;s French-speaking population lives in Africa; while it is an official language in 18 countries, it is not spoken as a first language by the majority, acting mainly as a second one or a lingua franca due to the many indigenous languages spoken in the territories. According to a 2023 estimate from the , an estimated 167 million African people spread across 35 countries and territories can speak French as either a first or a second language. This number does not include the people living in non-Francophone African countries who have learned French as a foreign language. Due to the rise of French in Africa, the total French-speaking population worldwide is expected to reach 700 million people in 2050. French was the fastest growing language on the continent (in terms of either official or foreign languages).

While spoken mainly as a second language, French is increasingly being spoken as a native language in Francophone Africa among some communities in urban areas or the elite class, especially in the cities of Abidjan in Ivory Coast, Kinshasa and Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Douala in Cameroon, Libreville in Gabon, and Antananarivo in Madagascar. However, some African countries such as Algeria intermittently attempted to remove the use of French in favor of native languages, and it was removed as an official language in Mali and Burkina Faso in 2023 and 2024 respectevely.

There is not a single African French, but multiple forms that diverged through contact with various indigenous African languages.

Sub-Saharan Africa is the region where the French language is most likely to expand, because of the expansion of education and rapid population growth. It is also where the language has evolved the most in recent years. Some vernacular forms of French in Africa can be difficult to understand for French speakers from other countries, but written forms of the language are very closely related to those of the rest of the French-speaking world.
=== Americas ===
==== Canada ====

French is the second most commonly spoken language in Canada and one of two federal official languages alongside English. As of the 2021 Canadian census, it was the native language of 7.7 million people (21% of the population) and the second language of 2.9 million (8% of the population). French is the sole official language in the province of Quebec, where some 80% of the population speak it as a native language and 95% are capable of conducting a conversation in it. Quebec is also home to the city of Montreal, which is the world&#x27;s fourth-largest French-speaking city, by number of first language speakers. New Brunswick and Manitoba are the only officially bilingual provinces, though full bilingualism is enacted only in New Brunswick, where about one third of the population is Francophone. French is also an official language of all of the territories (Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon). Out of the three, Yukon has the most French speakers, making up just under 4% of the population. Furthermore, while French is not an official language in Ontario, the French Language Services Act ensures that provincial services are available in the language. The Act applies to areas of the province where there are significant Francophone communities, namely Eastern Ontario and Northern Ontario. Elsewhere, sizable French-speaking minorities are found in southern Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and the Port au Port Peninsula in Newfoundland and Labrador, where the unique Newfoundland French dialect was historically spoken. Smaller pockets of French speakers exist in all other provinces. The Ontarian city of Ottawa, the Canadian capital, is also effectively bilingual, as it has a large population of federal government workers, who are required to offer services in both French and English, and is just across the river from the Quebecois city of Gatineau.

==== United States ====

According to the United States Census Bureau (2011), French is the fourth most spoken language in the United States after English, Spanish, and Chinese, when all forms of French are considered together and all dialects of Chinese are similarly combined. French is the second-most spoken language (after English) in the states of Maine and New Hampshire. In Louisiana, it is tied with Spanish for second-most spoken if Louisiana French and all creoles such as Haitian are included. French is the third most spoken language (after English and Spanish) in the states of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire. Louisiana is home to many distinct French dialects, collectively known as Louisiana French. New England French, essentially a variant of Canadian French, is spoken in parts of New England. Missouri French was historically spoken in Missouri and Illinois (formerly known as Upper Louisiana), but is nearly extinct today. French also survived in isolated pockets along the Gulf Coast of what was previously French Lower Louisiana, such as Mon Louis Island, Alabama and DeLisle, Mississippi (the latter only being discovered by linguists in the 1990s) but these varieties are severely endangered or presumed extinct.

==== Caribbean ====
French is one of two official languages in Haiti alongside Haitian Creole. It is the principal language of education, administration, business, and public signage and is spoken by all educated Haitians. It is also used for ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations, and church masses. The vast majority of the population speaks Haitian Creole as their first language; the rest largely speak French as a first language. As a French Creole language, Haitian Creole draws the large majority of its vocabulary from French, with influences from West African languages, as well as several European languages. It is closely related to Louisiana Creole and the creole from the Lesser Antilles.

French is the sole official language of all the overseas territories of France in the Caribbean that are collectively referred to as the French West Indies, namely Guadeloupe, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, and Martinique.

==== Other territories ====
French is the official language of both French Guiana on the South American continent, and of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, an archipelago off the coast of Newfoundland in North America.

=== Asia ===
==== Southeast Asia ====

French was the official language of the colony of French Indochina, comprising modern-day Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. It continues to be an administrative language in Laos and Cambodia, although its influence has waned in recent decades. In colonial Vietnam, the elites primarily spoke French, while many servants who worked in French households spoke a French pidgin known as &quot;Tây Bồi&quot; (now extinct). After French rule ended, South Vietnam continued to use French in administration, education, and trade. However, since the Fall of Saigon and the opening of a unified Vietnam&#x27;s economy, French has gradually been effectively displaced as the first foreign language of choice by English in Vietnam. Nevertheless, it continues to be taught as the other main foreign language in the Vietnamese educational system and is regarded as a cultural language.
All three countries are full members of La Francophonie (OIF).

==== India ====

French was the official language of French India, consisting of the geographically separate enclaves referred to as Puducherry. It continued to be an official language of the territory even after its cession to India in 1956 until 1965. A small number of older locals still retain knowledge of the language, although it has now given way to Tamil and English.

==== Lebanon ====

A former French mandate, Lebanon designates Arabic as the sole official language, while a special law regulates cases when French can be publicly used. Article 11 of Lebanon&#x27;s Constitution states that &quot;Arabic is the official national language. A law determines the cases in which the French language is to be used&quot;. The French language in Lebanon is a widespread second language among the Lebanese people, and is taught in many schools along with Arabic and English. French is used on Lebanese pound banknotes, on road signs, on Lebanese license plates, and on official buildings (alongside Arabic).

Today, French and English are secondary languages of Lebanon, with about 40% of the population being Francophone and 40% Anglophone. The use of English is growing in the business and media environment. Out of about 900,000 students, about 500,000 are enrolled in Francophone schools, public or private, in which the teaching of mathematics and scientific subjects is provided in French. Actual usage of French varies depending on the region and social status. One-third of high school students educated in French go on to pursue higher education in English-speaking institutions. English is the language of business and communication, with French being an element of social distinction, chosen for its emotional value.

=== Oceania and Australia ===

French is an official language of the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, where 31% of the population was estimated to speak it in 2023. In the French special collectivity of New Caledonia, 97% of the population can speak, read and write French while in French Polynesia this figure is 95%, and in the French collectivity of Wallis and Futuna, it is 84%.

In French Polynesia and to a lesser extent Wallis and Futuna, where oral and written knowledge of the French language has become almost universal (95% and 84% respectively), French increasingly tends to displace the native Polynesian languages as the language most spoken at home. In French Polynesia, the percentage of the population who reported that French was the language they use the most at home rose from 67% at the 2007 census to 74% at the 2017 census. In Wallis and Futuna, the percentage of the population who reported that French was the language they use the most at home rose from 10% at the 2008 census to 13% at the 2018 census.

=== Future ===
According to a demographic projection led by the and the Réseau Démographie de l&#x27;Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, the total number of French speakers will reach approximately 500 million in 2025 and 650 million by 2050, largely due to rapid population growth in sub-Saharan Africa. OIF estimates 700 million French speakers by 2050, 80% of whom will be in Africa.

In a study published in March 2014 by &quot;Forbes&quot;, the investment bank Natixis said that French could become the world&#x27;s most spoken language by 2050.

In the European Union, French was the dominant language within all institutions until the 1990s. After several enlargements of the EU (1995, 2004), French significantly lost ground in favour of English, which is more widely spoken and taught in most EU countries. French currently remains one of the three working languages, or &quot;procedural languages&quot;, of the EU, along with English and German. It is the second-most widely used language within EU institutions after English, but remains the preferred language of certain institutions or administrations such as the Court of Justice of the European Union, where it is the sole internal working language, or the Directorate-General for Agriculture. Since 2016, Brexit has rekindled discussions on whether or not French should again hold greater role within the institutions of the European Union.

== Current status and importance ==
According to the OIF, approximately 321 million people worldwide are &quot;able to speak the language&quot; as of 2022, without specifying the criteria for this estimation or whom it encompasses. A leading world language, French is taught in universities around the world, and is one of the world&#x27;s most influential languages because of its wide use in the worlds of journalism, jurisprudence, education, and diplomacy.
In diplomacy, French is one of the six official languages of the United Nations (and one of the UN Secretariat&#x27;s only two working languages), one of twenty official and three procedural languages of the European Union, an official language of NATO, the International Olympic Committee, the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Organization of American States (alongside Spanish, Portuguese and English), the Eurovision Song Contest, one of eighteen official languages of the European Space Agency, World Trade Organization and the least used of the three official languages in the North American Free Trade Agreement countries. It is also a working language in nonprofit organisations such as the Red Cross (alongside English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Russian), Amnesty International (alongside 32 other languages of which English is the most used, followed by Spanish, Portuguese, German, and Italian), Médecins sans Frontières (used alongside English, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic), and Médecins du Monde (used alongside English). Given the demographic prospects of the French-speaking nations of Africa, researcher Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry wrote in 2014 that French &quot;could be the language of the future&quot;. However, some African countries such as Algeria intermittently attempted to eradicate the use of French, and as of 2024 it was removed as an official language in Mali and Burkina Faso.

Significant as a judicial language, French is one of the official languages of such major international and regional courts, tribunals, and dispute-settlement bodies as the African Court on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights, the Caribbean Court of Justice, the Court of Justice for the Economic Community of West African States, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea the International Criminal Court and the World Trade Organization Appellate Body. It is the sole internal working language of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and makes with English the European Court of Human Rights&#x27;s two working languages.

In 1997, George Weber published, in &quot;Language Today&quot;, a comprehensive academic study entitled &quot;The World&#x27;s 10 most influential languages&quot;. In the article, Weber ranked French as, after English, the second-most &quot;influential&quot; language of the world, ahead of Spanish. His criteria were the numbers of native speakers, the number of secondary speakers (especially high for French among fellow world languages), the number of countries using the language and their respective populations, the economic power of the countries using the language, the number of major areas in which the language is used, and the linguistic prestige associated with the mastery of the language (Weber highlighted that French in particular enjoys considerable linguistic prestige). In a 2008 reassessment of his article, Weber concluded that his findings were still correct since &quot;the situation among the top ten remains unchanged.&quot;

Knowledge of French is often considered to be a useful skill by business owners in the United Kingdom; a 2014 study found that 50% of British managers considered French to be a valuable asset for their business, thus ranking French as the most sought-after foreign language there, ahead of German (49%) and Spanish (44%). MIT economist Albert Saiz calculated a 2.3% premium for those who have French as a foreign language in the workplace.

In 2011, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; ranked French the third most useful language for business, after English and Standard Mandarin Chinese.

In English-speaking Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, French is the first foreign language taught and in number of pupils is far ahead of other languages. In the United States, French is the second-most commonly taught foreign language in schools and universities, although well behind Spanish. In some areas of the country near French-speaking Quebec, however, it is the foreign language more commonly taught.

== Phonology ==

Vowel phonemes in French

Although there are many French regional accents, foreign learners normally use only one variety of the language.
* There are a maximum of 17 vowels in French, not all of which are used in every dialect: plus the nasalized vowels and . In France, the vowels , and are tending to be replaced by , and in many people&#x27;s speech, but the distinction of and is present in Meridional French. In Quebec and Belgian French, the vowels , , and are present.
* Voiced stops (i.e., ) are typically produced fully voiced throughout.
* Voiceless stops (i.e., ) are unaspirated.
* The velar nasal can occur in final position in borrowed (usually English) words: &quot;parking, camping, swing&quot;.
* The palatal nasal , which is written ⟨gn⟩, can occur in word initial position (e.g., &quot;gnon&quot;), but it is most frequently found in intervocalic, onset position or word-finally (e.g., &quot;montagne&quot;).
* French has three pairs of homorganic fricatives distinguished by voicing, i.e., labiodental , dental , and palato-alveolar . are dental, like the plosives and the nasal .
* French has one rhotic whose pronunciation varies considerably among speakers and phonetic contexts. In general, it is described as a voiced uvular fricative, as in &quot;&quot;, &quot;wheel&quot;. Vowels are often lengthened before this segment. It can be reduced to an approximant, particularly in final position (e.g., &quot;fort&quot;), or reduced to zero in some word-final positions. For other speakers, a uvular trill is also common, and an apical trill occurs in some dialects. The cluster /ʁw/ is generally pronounced as a labialised voiced uvular fricative [ʁʷ], such as in [ʁʷa] &quot;roi&quot;, &quot;king&quot;, or [kʁʷaʁ] &quot;croire&quot;, &quot;to believe&quot;.
* Lateral and central approximants: The lateral approximant is unvelarised in both onset (&quot;lire&quot;) and coda position (&quot;il&quot;). In the onset, the central approximants , , and each correspond to a high vowel, , , and respectively. There are a few minimal pairs where the approximant and corresponding vowel contrast, but there are also many cases where they are in free variation. Contrasts between and occur in final position as in &#x27;, &quot;pay&quot;, vs. &#x27;, &quot;country&quot;.
* The lateral approximant /l/ can be delateralised when word- or morpheme-final and preceded by /i/, such as in /tʁavaj/ &quot;travail&quot;, &quot;work&quot;, or when a word ending in ⟨al⟩ is pluralised, giving ⟨aux⟩ /o/.

French pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling, but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology. The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects, but the standard rules are:
* Final single consonants, in particular &quot;s&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;p&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, are normally silent. (A consonant is considered &quot;final&quot; when no vowel follows it even if one or more consonants follow it.) The final letters &quot;f&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, and &quot;l&quot;, however, are normally pronounced. The final c is sometimes pronounced like in bac, sac, roc but can also be silent like in blanc or estomac. The final &quot;r&quot; is usually silent when it follows an &quot;e&quot; in a word of two or more syllables, but it is pronounced in some words (&quot;hiver&quot;, &quot;super&quot;, &quot;cancer&quot; etc.).
** When the following word begins with a vowel, however, a silent consonant &quot;may&quot; once again be pronounced, to provide a &quot;liaison&quot; or &quot;link&quot; between the two words. Some liaisons are &quot;mandatory&quot;, for example the &quot;s&quot; in &quot;les amants&quot; or &quot;vous avez&quot;; some are &quot;optional&quot;, depending on dialect and register, for example, the first &quot;s&quot; in &quot;deux cents euros&quot; or &quot;euros irlandais&quot;; and some are &quot;forbidden&quot;, for example, the &quot;s&quot; in &quot;beaucoup d&#x27;hommes aiment&quot;. The &quot;t&quot; of &quot;et&quot; is never pronounced and the silent final consonant of a noun is only pronounced in the plural and in set phrases like &quot;pied-à-terre&quot;.
** Doubling a final &quot;n&quot; and adding a silent &quot;e&quot; at the end of a word (e.g., &quot;chien&quot; → &quot;chienne&quot;) makes it clearly pronounced. Doubling a final &quot;l&quot; and adding a silent &quot;e&quot; (e.g., &quot;gentil&quot; → &quot;gentille&quot;) adds a [j] sound if the &quot;l&quot; is preceded by the letter &quot;i&quot;.
* Some monosyllabic function words ending in &quot;a&quot; or &quot;e&quot;, such as &quot;je&quot; and &quot;que&quot;, drop their final vowel when placed before a word that begins with a vowel sound (thus avoiding a hiatus). The missing vowel is replaced by an apostrophe. (e.g., &quot;*je ai&quot; is instead pronounced and spelled → &quot;j&#x27;ai&quot;). This gives, for example, the same pronunciation for &quot;l&#x27;homme qu&#x27;il a vu&quot; (&quot;the man whom he saw&quot;) and &quot;l&#x27;homme qui l&#x27;a vu&quot; (&quot;the man who saw him&quot;). However, for Belgian French the sentences are pronounced differently; in the first sentence the syllable break is as &quot;qu&#x27;il-a&quot;, while the second breaks as &quot;qui-l&#x27;a&quot;. It can also be noted that, in Quebec French, the second example (&quot;l&#x27;homme qui l&#x27;a vu&quot;) is more emphasized on &quot;l&#x27;a vu&quot;.

== Writing system ==

=== Alphabet ===
French is written with the 26 letters of the basic Latin script, with four diacritics appearing on vowels (circumflex accent, acute accent, grave accent, diaeresis) and the cedilla appearing in &quot;ç&quot;.

There are two ligatures, &quot;œ&quot; and &quot;æ&quot;, but they are often replaced in contemporary French with &quot;oe&quot; and &quot;ae&quot;, because the ligatures do not appear on the AZERTY keyboard layout used in French-speaking countries. However this is nonstandard in formal and literary texts.

=== Orthography ===
French spelling, like English spelling, tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules. This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period, without a corresponding change in spelling. Moreover, some conscious changes were made to restore Latin orthography (as with some English words such as &quot;debt&quot;):
* Old French &quot;doit&quot; &gt; French &quot;&quot; &quot;finger&quot; (Latin &quot;digitus&quot;)
* Old French &quot;pie&quot; &gt; French &quot;&quot; &quot;foot&quot; [Latin &quot;pes&quot; (stem: &quot;ped-&quot;)]

French orthography is morphophonemic. While it contains 130 graphemes that denote only 36 phonemes, many of its spelling rules are likely due to a consistency in morphemic patterns such as adding suffixes and prefixes. Many given spellings of common morphemes usually lead to a predictable sound. In particular, a given vowel combination or diacritic generally leads to one phoneme. However, there is not a one-to-one relation of a phoneme and a single related grapheme, which can be seen in how &quot;tomber&quot; and &quot;tombé&quot; both end with the /e/ phoneme. Additionally, there are many variations in the pronunciation of consonants at the end of words, demonstrated by how the &quot;x&quot; in &quot;paix&quot; is not pronounced though at the end of &quot;Aix&quot; it is&quot;.&quot;

As a result, it can be difficult to predict the spelling of a word based on the sound. Final consonants are generally silent, except when the following word begins with a vowel (see Liaison (French)). For example, the following words end in a vowel sound: &quot;pied&quot;, &quot;aller&quot;, &quot;les&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;beaux&quot;. The same words followed by a vowel, however, may sound the consonants, as they do in these examples: &quot;beaux-arts&quot;, &quot;les amis&quot;, &quot;pied-à-terre&quot;.

French writing, as with any language, is affected by the spoken language. In Old French, the plural for &quot;animal&quot; was &quot;animals&quot;. The sequence was unstable and was turned into a diphthong . This change was then reflected in the orthography: &quot;animaus&quot;. The &quot;us&quot; ending, very common in Latin, was then abbreviated by copyists (monks) by the letter &quot;x&quot;, resulting in a written form &quot;animax&quot;. As the French language further evolved, the pronunciation of &quot;au&quot; turned into so that the &quot;u&quot; was reestablished in orthography for consistency, resulting in modern French &quot;animaux&quot; (pronounced first before the final was dropped in contemporary French). The same is true for &quot;cheval&quot; pluralized as &quot;chevaux&quot; and many others. In addition, &quot;castel&quot; pl. &quot;castels&quot; became &quot;château&quot; pl. &quot;châteaux&quot;.
* Nasal: &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot;. When &quot;n&quot; or &quot;m&quot; follows a vowel or diphthong, the &quot;n&quot; or &quot;m&quot; becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasalized (i.e., pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part of the air to leave through the nostrils). Exceptions are when the &quot;n&quot; or &quot;m&quot; is doubled, or immediately followed by a vowel. The prefixes &quot;en-&quot; and &quot;em-&quot; are always nasalized. The rules are more complex than this but may vary between dialects.
* Digraphs: French uses not only diacritics to specify its large range of vowel sounds and diphthongs, but also specific combinations of vowels, sometimes with following consonants, to show which sound is intended.
* Gemination: Within words, double consonants are generally not pronounced as geminates in modern French (but geminates can be heard in the cinema or TV news from as recently as the 1970s, and in very refined elocution they may still occur). For example, &quot;illusion&quot; is pronounced and not . However, gemination does occur between words; for example, &quot;une info&quot; (&quot;a news item&quot; or &quot;a piece of information&quot;) is pronounced , whereas &quot;une nympho&quot; (&quot;a nymphomaniac&quot;) is pronounced .
* Accents are used sometimes for pronunciation, sometimes to distinguish similar words, and sometimes based on etymology alone.
** Accents that affect pronunciation
*** The acute accent (&#x27;) &quot;é&quot; (e.g., &quot;é&quot;&#x27;cole&quot;—school) means that the vowel is pronounced instead of the default .
*** The grave accent (&#x27;) &quot;è&quot; (e.g., &quot;élè&quot;&#x27;ve&quot;—pupil) means that the vowel is pronounced instead of the default .
*** The circumflex (&#x27;) &quot;ê&quot; (e.g. &quot;forê&quot;&#x27;t&quot;—forest) shows that an &quot;e&quot; is pronounced and that an &quot;ô&quot; is pronounced . In standard French, it also signifies a pronunciation of for the letter &quot;â&quot;, but this differentiation is disappearing. In the mid-18th century, the circumflex was used in place of &quot;s&quot; after a vowel, where that letter &quot;s&quot; was not pronounced. Thus, &quot;forest&quot; became &quot;forêt&quot;, &quot;hospital&quot; became &quot;hôpital&quot;, and &quot;hostel&quot; became &quot;hôtel&quot;.
*** Diaeresis or &quot;&quot; (&quot;ë&quot;, &quot;ï&quot;, &quot;ü&quot;, &quot;ÿ&quot;): over &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot; or &quot;y&quot;, indicates that a vowel is to be pronounced separately from the preceding one: &quot;naïve&quot;, &quot;Noël&quot;.
**** The combination of &quot;e&quot; with diaeresis following &quot;o&quot; (&quot;Noël&quot; ) is nasalized in the regular way if followed by &quot;n&quot; (&quot;Samoëns&quot; )
**** The combination of &quot;e&quot; with diaeresis following &quot;a&quot; is either pronounced (&quot;Raphaël&quot;, &quot;Israël&quot; ) or not pronounced, leaving only the &quot;a&quot; (&quot;Staël&quot; ) and the &quot;a&quot; is nasalized in the regular way if &quot;aë&quot; is followed by &quot;n&quot; (&quot;Saint-Saëns&quot; )
**** A diaeresis on &quot;y&quot; only occurs in some proper names and in modern editions of old French texts. Some proper names in which &quot;ÿ&quot; appears include &quot;Aÿ&quot; (a commune in Marne, formerly &quot;Aÿ-Champagne&quot;), &#x27; (an alley in Paris), &quot;Croÿ&quot; (family name and hotel on the Boulevard Raspail, Paris), &#x27; (near Pontoise), &quot;Ghÿs&quot; (name of Flemish origin spelt &quot;Ghĳs&quot; where &quot;ĳ&quot; in handwriting looked like &quot;ÿ&quot; to French clerks), &quot;L&#x27;Haÿ-les-Roses&quot; (commune near Paris), Pierre Louÿs (author), Moÿ-de-l&#x27;Aisne (commune in Aisne and a family name), and &quot;Le Blanc de Nicolaÿ&quot; (an insurance company in eastern France).
**** The diaeresis on &quot;u&quot; appears in the Biblical proper names &quot;Archélaüs&quot;, &quot;Capharnaüm&quot;, &quot;Emmaüs&quot;, &quot;Ésaü&quot;, and &quot;Saül&quot;, as well as French names such as Haüy. Nevertheless, since the 1990 orthographic changes, the diaeresis in words containing &quot;guë&quot; (such as &quot;aiguë&quot; or &quot;ciguë&quot;) may be moved onto the &quot;u&quot;: &quot;aigüe&quot;, &quot;cigüe&quot;, and by analogy may be used in verbs such as &quot;j&#x27;argüe&quot;.
**** In addition, words coming from German retain their umlaut (&quot;ä&quot;, &quot;ö&quot; and &quot;ü&quot;) if applicable but use often French pronunciation, such as &quot;Kärcher&quot; (trademark of a pressure washer).
*** The cedilla (&#x27;) &quot;ç&quot; (e.g., &quot;garç&quot;&#x27;on&quot;—boy) means that the letter &quot;ç&quot; is pronounced in front of the back vowels &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u&quot; (&quot;c&quot; is otherwise before a back vowel). &quot;C&quot; is always pronounced in front of the front vowels &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, and &quot;y&quot;, thus &quot;ç&quot; is never found in front of front vowels. This letter is used when a front vowel after ⟨c⟩, such as in &quot;France&quot; or &quot;placer&quot;, is replaced with a back vowel. To retain the pronunciation of the ⟨c⟩, it is given a cedilla, as in &quot;français&quot; or &quot;plaçons&quot;.
** Accents with no pronunciation effect
*** The circumflex does not affect the pronunciation of the letters &quot;i&quot; or &quot;u&quot;, nor, in most dialects, &quot;a&quot;. It usually indicates that an &quot;s&quot; came after it long ago, as in &quot;île&quot; (from former &quot;isle&quot;, compare with English word &quot;isle&quot;). The explanation is that some words share the same orthography, so the circumflex is put here to mark the difference between the two words. For example, &quot;dites&quot; (you say) / &quot;dîtes&quot; (you said), or even &quot;du&quot; (of the) / &quot;dû&quot; (past participle for the verb &quot;devoir&quot; = must, have to, owe; in this case, the circumflex disappears in the plural and the feminine).
*** All other accents are used only to distinguish similar words, as in the case of distinguishing the adverbs &#x27; and &#x27; (&quot;there&quot;, &quot;where&quot;) from the article &#x27; (&quot;the&quot; feminine singular) and the conjunction &#x27; (&quot;or&quot;), respectively.

Some proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system, but they still fail to gather interest.

In 1990, a reform accepted some changes to French orthography. At the time the proposed changes were considered to be suggestions. In 2016, schoolbooks in France began to use the newer recommended spellings, with instruction to teachers that both old and new spellings be deemed correct.

== Grammar ==

French is a moderately inflected language. Nouns and most pronouns are inflected for number (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently); adjectives, for number and gender (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; personal pronouns and a few other pronouns, for person, number, gender, and case; and verbs, for tense, aspect, mood, and the person and number of their subjects. Case is primarily marked using word order and prepositions, while certain verb features are marked using auxiliary verbs. According to the French lexicogrammatical system, French has a rank-scale hierarchy with clause as the top rank, which is followed by group rank, word rank, and morpheme rank. A French clause is made up of groups, groups are made up of words, and lastly, words are made up of morphemes.

French grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages, including
* the loss of Latin declensions
* the loss of the neuter gender
* the development of grammatical articles from Latin demonstratives
* the loss of certain Latin tenses and the creation of new tenses from auxiliaries.

=== Nouns ===
Every French noun is either masculine or feminine. Because French nouns are not inflected for gender, a noun&#x27;s form cannot specify its gender. For nouns regarding the living, their grammatical genders often correspond to that which they refer to. For example, a male teacher is an &quot;enseignant&quot; while a female teacher is an &quot;enseignante&quot;. However, plural nouns that refer to a group that includes both masculine and feminine entities are always masculine. So a group of two male teachers would be &quot;enseignants&quot;. A group of two male teachers and two female teachers would still be &quot;enseignants&quot;. However, a group of two female teachers would be &quot;enseignantes&quot;. In many situations, including in the case of &quot;enseignant&quot;, both the singular and plural form of a noun are pronounced identically. The article used for singular nouns is different from that used for plural nouns and the article provides a distinguishing factor between the two in speech. For example, the singular &quot;le professeur&quot; or &quot;la professeure&quot; (the male or female teacher, professor) can be distinguished from the plural &quot;les professeur(e)s&quot; because &quot;le&quot; /lə/, &quot;la&quot; /la/, and &quot;les&quot; /le(s)/ are all pronounced differently. With &quot;enseignant&quot;, however, for both singular forms the &quot;le/la&quot; becomes &quot;l&quot;&#x27;, and so the only difference in pronunciation is that the ⟨t⟩ on the end of masculine form is silent, whereas it is pronounced in the feminine. If the word was to be followed by a word starting with a vowel, then liaison would cause the ⟨t⟩ to be pronounced in both forms, resulting in identical pronunciation. There are also some situations where both the feminine and masculine form of a noun are the same and the article provides the only difference. For example, &quot;le dentiste&quot; refers to a male dentist while &quot;la dentiste&quot; refers to a female dentist. Furthermore, a few nouns&#x27; meanings depend on their gender. For example, &quot;un livre&quot; (masculine) refers to a book, while &quot;une livre&quot; a (feminine) is a pound.

=== Verbs ===
==== Moods and tense-aspect forms ====
The French language consists of both finite and non-finite moods. The finite moods include the indicative mood (indicatif), the subjunctive mood (subjonctif), the imperative mood (impératif), and the conditional mood (conditionnel). The non-finite moods include the infinitive mood (infinitif), the present participle (participe présent), and the past participle (participe passé).

===== Finite moods =====

====== Indicative (indicatif) ======
The indicative mood makes use of eight tense-aspect forms. These include the present (), the simple past ( and ), the past imperfective (), the pluperfect (), the simple future (), the future perfect (), and the past perfect (). Some forms are less commonly used today. In today&#x27;s spoken French, the is used while the is reserved for formal situations or for literary purposes. Similarly, the is used for speaking rather than the older seen in literary works.

Within the indicative mood, the , , , and all use auxiliary verbs in their forms.
====== Subjunctive (subjonctif) ======
The subjunctive mood only includes four of the tense-aspect forms found in the indicative: present (présent), simple past (passé composé), past imperfective (imparfait), and pluperfect (plus-que-parfait).

Within the subjunctive mood, the passé composé and plus-que-parfait use auxiliary verbs in their forms.
====== Imperative (imperatif) ======
The imperative is used in the present tense (with the exception of a few instances where it is used in the perfect tense). The imperative is used to give commands to you (tu), we/us (nous), and plural you (vous).
====== Conditional (conditionnel) ======
The conditional makes use of the present (présent) and the past (passé).

The passé uses auxiliary verbs in its forms.
==== Voice ====
French uses both the active voice and the passive voice. The active voice is unmarked while the passive voice is formed by using a form of verb &quot;&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;) and the past participle.

Example of the active voice:
* &quot;&quot; &quot;She loves the dog.&quot;
* &quot;&quot; &quot;Marc drove the car.&quot;
Example of the passive voice:
* &quot;&quot; &quot;The dog is loved by her.&quot;
* &quot;&quot; &quot;The car was driven by Marc.&quot;
However, unless the subject of the sentence is specified, generally the pronoun &quot;on&quot; &quot;one&quot; is used:
* &quot;&quot; &quot;The dog is loved. (Literally &quot;one loves the dog.&quot;)&quot;
* &quot;&quot; &quot;The car is (being) driven. (Literally &quot;one drives the car.&quot;)&quot;

Word order is subject–verb–object although a pronoun object precedes the verb. Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders, in particular inversion of the subject and verb, as in &quot;&quot; when asking a question rather than &quot;Vous parlez français ?&quot; Both formulations are used, and carry a rising inflection on the last word. The literal English translations are &quot;Do you speak French?&quot; and &quot;You speak French?&quot;, respectively. To avoid inversion while asking a question, &quot;Est-ce que&quot; (literally &quot;is it that&quot;) may be placed at the beginning of the sentence. &quot;Parlez-vous français ?&quot; may become &quot;Est-ce que vous parlez français ?&quot; French also uses verb–object–subject (VOS) and object–subject–verb (OSV) word order. OSV word order is not used often and VOS is reserved for formal writings.

== Vocabulary ==

The majority of French words derive from Vulgar Latin or were constructed from Latin or Greek roots. In many cases, a single etymological root appears in French in a &quot;popular&quot; or native form, inherited from Vulgar Latin, and a learned form, borrowed later from Classical Latin. The following pairs consist of a native noun and a learned adjective:
* brother: &quot;&quot; / &quot;&quot; from Latin &quot; / &quot;
* finger: &quot;&quot; / &quot;&quot; from Latin &quot; / &quot;
* faith: &quot;&quot; / &quot;&quot; from Latin &quot; / &quot;
* eye: &quot;&quot; / &quot;&quot; from Latin &quot; / &quot;

However, a historical tendency to Gallicise Latin roots can be identified, whereas English conversely leans towards a more direct incorporation of the Latin:
* &quot;&quot; / &quot;radiation&quot; from Latin &quot;&quot;
* &quot;&quot; / &quot;extinguish&quot; from Latin &quot;&quot;
* &quot;&quot; / &quot;nucleus&quot; from Latin &quot;&quot;
* &quot;&quot; / &quot;insolation&quot; from Latin &quot;&quot;

There are also noun-noun and adjective-adjective pairs:
* thing/cause: &quot;&quot; / &quot;&quot; from Latin &quot;&quot;
* cold: &quot;&quot; / &quot;&quot; from Latin &quot;&quot;

It can be difficult to identify the Latin source of native French words because in the evolution from Vulgar Latin, unstressed syllables were severely reduced and the remaining vowels and consonants underwent significant modifications.

More recently (1994) the linguistic policy (Toubon Law) of the French language academies of France and Quebec has been to provide French equivalents to (mainly English) imported words, either by using existing vocabulary, extending its meaning or deriving a new word according to French morphological rules. The result is often two (or more) co-existing terms for describing the same phenomenon.
* &quot;mercatique &quot;/ &quot;marketing&quot;
* &quot;finance&quot; &quot;fantôme&quot; / &quot;shadow&quot; &quot;banking&quot;
* &quot;bloc-notes&quot; / &quot;notepad&quot;
* &quot;ailière&quot; / &quot;wingsuit&quot;
* &quot;tiers-lieu &quot;/&quot; coworking&quot;

It is estimated that 12% (4,200) of common French words found in a typical dictionary such as the &quot;Petit Larousse&quot; or &quot;Micro-Robert Plus&quot; (35,000 words) are of foreign origin (where Greek and Latin learned words are not seen as foreign). About 25% (1,054) of these foreign words come from English and are fairly recent borrowings. The others are some 707 words from Italian, 550 from ancient Germanic languages, 481 from other Gallo-Romance languages, 215 from Arabic, 164 from German, 160 from Celtic languages, 159 from Spanish, 153 from Dutch, 112 from Persian and Sanskrit, 101 from Native American languages, 89 from other Asian languages, 56 from other Afro-Asiatic languages, 55 from Balto-Slavic languages, 10 from Basque and 144 (about 3%) from other languages.

One study analyzing the degree of differentiation of Romance languages in comparison to Latin estimated that among the languages analyzed French has the greatest distance from Latin. The French language&#x27;s lexical similarity to a selection of other Romance languages is 89% with Italian, 80% with Sardinian, 78% with Rhaeto-Romance, and 75% with Romanian, Spanish and Portuguese.

=== Numerals ===
The numeral system used in the majority of Francophone countries employs both decimal and vigesimal counting. After the use of unique names for the numbers 1–16, those from 17 to 69 are counted by tens, while twenty (&#x27;) is used as a base number in the names of numbers from 70 to 99. The French word for 80 is &#x27;, literally &quot;four twenties&quot;, and the word for &quot;75&quot; is &quot;&quot;, literally &quot;sixty-fifteen&quot;. The vigesimal method of counting is analogous to the archaic English use of &quot;score&quot;, as in &quot;fourscore and seven&quot; (87), or &quot;threescore and ten&quot; (70).

Belgian, Swiss, and Aostan French as well as that used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi, use different names for 70 and 90, namely &#x27; and &#x27;. In Switzerland, depending on the local dialect, 80 can be &#x27; (Geneva, Neuchâtel, Jura) or &#x27; (Vaud, Valais, Fribourg). The Aosta Valley similarly uses &quot;&quot; for 80. Conversely, Belgium and in its former African colonies use &quot;quatre-vingts&quot; for 80.

In Old French (during the Middle Ages), all numbers from 30 to 99 could be said in either base 10 or base 20, e.g. &quot;vint et doze&quot; (twenty and twelve) for 32, &quot;dous vinz et diz&quot; (two twenties and ten) for 50, &quot;uitante&quot; for 80, or &quot;nonante&quot; for 90.

The term &quot;octante&quot; was historically used in Switzerland for 80, but is now considered archaic.

French, like most European languages, uses a space to separate thousands. The comma () is used in French numbers as a decimal point, i.e. &quot;2,5&quot; instead of &quot;2.5&quot;. In the case of currencies, the currency markers are substituted for decimal point, i.e. &quot;5$7&quot; for &quot;5 dollars and 7 cents&quot;.

Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in French:

Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in English:
:&quot;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&quot;

<text>In popular culture, formula fiction is literature in which the storylines and plots have been reused to the extent that the narratives are predictable. It is similar to genre fiction, which identifies a number of specific settings that are frequently reused. The label of &quot;formula fiction&quot; is used in literary criticism as a mild pejorative to imply lack of originality.

==Varieties==
The &quot;formula&quot; is defined specifically by predictable narrative structure. Formulaic tales incorporate plots that have been reused so often as to be easily recognizable. Perhaps the most clearly formulaic plots characterize the romantic comedy genre; in a book or film labeled as such, viewers already know its most basic central plot, including to some extent the ending. This does not always prove to be detrimental to a given work&#x27;s reception however, as the popularity of the aforementioned genre demonstrates.

Formula fiction is often stereotypically associated with early pulp magazine markets, though some works published in that medium, such as &quot;The Cold Equations&quot;, subvert the supposed expectations of the common narrative formula of that time.

==Distinct from genre conventions==
The &quot;formula&quot; is limited to structure of the plot itself. It does not include conventional, stereotypical elements of the genre used for the story background.
Genres like high fantasy, westerns, and space opera (an adventure story in a science fiction setting) often have specific settings, such as a pseudo-Medieval European setting, the Old West, or outer space.

For any given genre, certain assumed background information covers the nature and purpose of predictable elements of the story, such as the appearance of dragons and wizards in high fantasy, warp drives and rayguns in science fiction, or shootouts at high noon in Westerns. These are taken as conventional in the genre and do not need to be explained anew to the reader, they may be included implicitly as part of the genre&#x27;s formula, but they do not constitute the plot structure that makes a story formulaic.

Note however that stereotypical elements can also easily be treated subversively, to contradict some of the expectations inherent in the genre&#x27;s formula.

==Distinct from &quot;pastiche&quot; fiction==
&quot;Formula fiction&quot; should not be confused with &quot;pastiche&quot;: Fiction mimicking another work or author&#x27;s style.
Comedy as a whole – including parody, satire, and subgenres such as romantic comedy – often relies on either formulaic elements, or mocking contradiction of such elements.

Though pastiche may naturally include formulaic elements, the same holds true of parody and satire. All may well include formulaic elements such as common stereotypes or caricatures, or which may use formulaic elements in order to mock them or point out their supposedly cliché or unrealistic natures.

<text>In mathematics, a field is a set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined and behave as the corresponding operations on rational and real numbers. A field is thus a fundamental algebraic structure which is widely used in algebra, number theory, and many other areas of mathematics.

The best known fields are the field of rational numbers, the field of real numbers and the field of complex numbers. Many other fields, such as fields of rational functions, algebraic function fields, algebraic number fields, and &quot;p&quot;-adic fields are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and algebraic geometry. Most cryptographic protocols rely on finite fields, i.e., fields with finitely many elements.

The theory of fields proves that angle trisection and squaring the circle cannot be done with a compass and straightedge. Galois theory, devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions, provides an elegant proof of the Abel–Ruffini theorem that general quintic equations cannot be solved in radicals.

Fields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of mathematical analysis, which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard general context for linear algebra. Number fields, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.

== Definition ==
Informally, a field is a set, along with two operations defined on that set: an addition operation and a multiplication operation , both of which behave similarly as they do for rational numbers and real numbers. This includes the existence of an additive inverse for all elements and of a multiplicative inverse for every nonzero element . This allows the definition of the so-called &quot;inverse operations&quot;, subtraction and division , as and .
Often the product is represented by juxtaposition, as .

=== Classic definition ===
Formally, a field is a set together with two binary operations on called &quot;addition&quot; and &quot;multiplication&quot;. A binary operation on is a mapping , that is, a correspondence that associates with each ordered pair of elements of a uniquely determined element of . The result of the addition of and is called the sum of and , and is denoted . Similarly, the result of the multiplication of and is called the product of and , and is denoted . These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as &quot;field axioms&quot;. 

These axioms are required to hold for all elements , , of the field :
* Associativity of addition and multiplication: , and .
* Commutativity of addition and multiplication: , and .
* Additive and multiplicative identity: there exist two distinct elements and in such that and .
* Additive inverses: for every in , there exists an element in , denoted , called the &quot;additive inverse&quot; of , such that .
* Multiplicative inverses: for every in , there exists an element in , denoted by or , called the &quot;multiplicative inverse&quot; of , such that .
* Distributivity of multiplication over addition: .

An equivalent, and more succinct, definition is: a field has two commutative operations, called addition and multiplication; it is a group under addition with as the additive identity; the nonzero elements form a group under multiplication with as the multiplicative identity; and multiplication distributes over addition.

Even more succinctly: a field is a commutative ring where and all nonzero elements are invertible under multiplication.

=== Alternative definition ===
Fields can also be defined in different, but equivalent ways. One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and their required properties. Division by zero is, by definition, excluded. In order to avoid existential quantifiers, fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two unary operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses respectively), and two nullary operations (the constants and ). These operations are then subject to the conditions above. Avoiding existential quantifiers is important in constructive mathematics and computing. One may equivalently define a field by the same two binary operations, one unary operation (the multiplicative inverse), and two (not necessarily distinct) constants and , since and .

== Examples ==

=== Rational numbers ===

Rational numbers have been widely used a long time before the elaboration of the concept of field.
They are numbers that can be written as fractions
, where and are integers, and . The additive inverse of such a fraction is , and the multiplicative inverse (provided that ) is , which can be seen as follows:
: formula_1

The abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers. For example, the law of distributivity can be proven as follows:
: formula_2

=== Real and complex numbers ===

The real numbers , with the usual operations of addition and multiplication, also form a field. The complex numbers consist of expressions
: with real,
where is the imaginary unit, i.e., a (non-real) number satisfying .
Addition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in such a way that expressions of this type satisfy all field axioms and thus hold for . For example, the distributive law enforces
It is immediate that this is again an expression of the above type, and so the complex numbers form a field. Complex numbers can be geometrically represented as points in the plane, with Cartesian coordinates given by the real numbers of their describing expression, or as the arrows from the origin to these points, specified by their length and an angle enclosed with some distinct direction. Addition then corresponds to combining the arrows to the intuitive parallelogram (adding the Cartesian coordinates), and the multiplication is – less intuitively – combining rotating and scaling of the arrows (adding the angles and multiplying the lengths). The fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, and many other scientific disciplines.

=== Constructible numbers ===

In antiquity, several geometric problems concerned the (in)feasibility of constructing certain numbers with compass and straightedge. For example, it was unknown to the Greeks that it is, in general, impossible to trisect a given angle in this way. These problems can be settled using the field of constructible numbers. Real constructible numbers are, by definition, lengths of line segments that can be constructed from the points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only compass and straightedge. These numbers, endowed with the field operations of real numbers, restricted to the constructible numbers, form a field, which properly includes the field of rational numbers. The illustration shows the construction of square roots of constructible numbers, not necessarily contained within . Using the labeling in the illustration, construct the segments , , and a semicircle over (center at the midpoint ), which intersects the perpendicular line through in a point , at a distance of exactly formula_3 from when has length one.

Not all real numbers are constructible. It can be shown that formula_4 is not a constructible number, which implies that it is impossible to construct with compass and straightedge the length of the side of a cube with volume 2, another problem posed by the ancient Greeks.

=== A field with four elements ===

In addition to familiar number systems such as the rationals, there are other, less immediate examples of fields. The following example is a field consisting of four elements called , , , and . The notation is chosen such that plays the role of the additive identity element (denoted 0 in the axioms above), and is the multiplicative identity (denoted in the axioms above). The field axioms can be verified by using some more field theory, or by direct computation. For example,
: , which equals , as required by the distributivity.

This field is called a finite field or Galois field with four elements, and is denoted or . The subset consisting of and (highlighted in red in the tables at the right) is also a field, known as the &quot;binary field&quot; or .

== Elementary notions ==
In this section, denotes an arbitrary field and and are arbitrary elements of .

=== Consequences of the definition ===
One has and . In particular, one may deduce the additive inverse of every element as soon as one knows .

If then or must be , since, if , then
. This means that every field is an integral domain.

In addition, the following properties are true for any elements and :
: 
: 
: if 

=== Additive and multiplicative groups of a field ===
The axioms of a field imply that it is an abelian group under addition. This group is called the additive group of the field, and is sometimes denoted by when denoting it simply as could be confusing.

Similarly, the &quot;nonzero&quot; elements of form an abelian group under multiplication, called the multiplicative group, and denoted by formula_5 or just formula_6, or .

A field may thus be defined as set equipped with two operations denoted as an addition and a multiplication such that is an abelian group under addition, formula_6 is an abelian group under multiplication (where 0 is the identity element of the addition), and multiplication is distributive over addition. Some elementary statements about fields can therefore be obtained by applying general facts of groups. For example, the additive and multiplicative inverses and are uniquely determined by .

The requirement is imposed by convention to exclude the trivial ring, which consists of a single element; this guides any choice of the axioms that define fields.

Every finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is cyclic (see &quot;&quot;).

=== Characteristic ===
In addition to the multiplication of two elements of , it is possible to define the product of an arbitrary element of by a positive integer to be the -fold sum
: (which is an element of .)

If there is no positive integer such that
then is said to have characteristic . For example, the field of rational numbers has characteristic 0 since no positive integer is zero. Otherwise, if there &quot;is&quot; a positive integer satisfying this equation, the smallest such positive integer can be shown to be a prime number. It is usually denoted by and the field is said to have characteristic then.
For example, the field has characteristic since (in the notation of the above addition table) .

If has characteristic , then for all in . This implies that
since all other binomial coefficients appearing in the binomial formula are divisible by . Here, ( factors) is the th power, i.e., the -fold product of the element . Therefore, the Frobenius map
is compatible with the addition in (and also with the multiplication), and is therefore a field homomorphism. The existence of this homomorphism makes fields in characteristic quite different from fields of characteristic .

=== Subfields and prime fields ===
A &quot;subfield&quot; of a field is a subset of that is a field with respect to the field operations of . Equivalently is a subset of that contains , and is closed under addition, multiplication, additive inverse and multiplicative inverse of a nonzero element. This means that , that for all both and are in , and that for all in , both and are in .

Field homomorphisms are maps between two fields such that , , and , where and are arbitrary elements of . All field homomorphisms are injective. If is also surjective, it is called an isomorphism (or the fields and are called isomorphic).

A field is called a prime field if it has no proper (i.e., strictly smaller) subfields. Any field contains a prime field. If the characteristic of is (a prime number), the prime field is isomorphic to the finite field introduced below. Otherwise the prime field is isomorphic to .

== Finite fields ==

&quot;Finite fields&quot; (also called &quot;Galois fields&quot;) are fields with finitely many elements, whose number is also referred to as the order of the field. The above introductory example is a field with four elements. Its subfield is the smallest field, because by definition a field has at least two distinct elements, and .
The simplest finite fields, with prime order, are most directly accessible using modular arithmetic. For a fixed positive integer , arithmetic &quot;modulo &quot; means to work with the numbers
The addition and multiplication on this set are done by performing the operation in question in the set of integers, dividing by and taking the remainder as result. This construction yields a field precisely if is a prime number. For example, taking the prime results in the above-mentioned field . For and more generally, for any composite number (i.e., any number which can be expressed as a product of two strictly smaller natural numbers), is not a field: the product of two non-zero elements is zero since in , which, as was explained above, prevents from being a field. The field with elements ( being prime) constructed in this way is usually denoted by .

Every finite field has elements, where is prime and . This statement holds since may be viewed as a vector space over its prime field. The dimension of this vector space is necessarily finite, say , which implies the asserted statement.

A field with elements can be constructed as the splitting field of the polynomial
Such a splitting field is an extension of in which the polynomial has zeros. This means has as many zeros as possible since the degree of is . For , it can be checked case by case using the above multiplication table that all four elements of satisfy the equation , so they are zeros of . By contrast, in , has only two zeros (namely and ), so does not split into linear factors in this smaller field. Elaborating further on basic field-theoretic notions, it can be shown that two finite fields with the same order are isomorphic. It is thus customary to speak of &quot;the&quot; finite field with elements, denoted by or .

== History ==
Historically, three algebraic disciplines led to the concept of a field: the question of solving polynomial equations, algebraic number theory, and algebraic geometry. A first step towards the notion of a field was made in 1770 by Joseph-Louis Lagrange, who observed that permuting the zeros of a cubic polynomial in the expression
(with being a third root of unity) only yields two values. This way, Lagrange conceptually explained the classical solution method of Scipione del Ferro and François Viète, which proceeds by reducing a cubic equation for an unknown to a quadratic equation for . Together with a similar observation for equations of degree 4, Lagrange thus linked what eventually became the concept of fields and the concept of groups. Vandermonde, also in 1770, and to a fuller extent, Carl Friedrich Gauss, in his &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; (1801), studied the equation
for a prime and, again using modern language, the resulting cyclic Galois group. Gauss deduced that a regular -gon can be constructed if . Building on Lagrange&#x27;s work, Paolo Ruffini claimed (1799) that quintic equations (polynomial equations of degree ) cannot be solved algebraically; however, his arguments were flawed. These gaps were filled by Niels Henrik Abel in 1824. Évariste Galois, in 1832, devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable, thus establishing in effect what is known as Galois theory today. Both Abel and Galois worked with what is today called an algebraic number field, but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field, nor of a group.

In 1871 Richard Dedekind introduced, for a set of real or complex numbers that is closed under the four arithmetic operations, the German word &quot;Körper&quot;, which means &quot;body&quot; or &quot;corpus&quot; (to suggest an organically closed entity). The English term &quot;field&quot; was introduced by .

In 1881 Leopold Kronecker defined what he called a &quot;domain of rationality&quot;, which is a field of rational fractions in modern terms. Kronecker&#x27;s notion did not cover the field of all algebraic numbers (which is a field in Dedekind&#x27;s sense), but on the other hand was more abstract than Dedekind&#x27;s in that it made no specific assumption on the nature of the elements of a field. Kronecker interpreted a field such as abstractly as the rational function field . Prior to this, examples of transcendental numbers were known since Joseph Liouville&#x27;s work in 1844, until Charles Hermite (1873) and Ferdinand von Lindemann (1882) proved the transcendence of and , respectively.

The first clear definition of an abstract field is due to . In particular, Heinrich Martin Weber&#x27;s notion included the field . Giuseppe Veronese (1891) studied the field of formal power series, which led to introduce the field of -adic numbers. synthesized the knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far. He axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field-theoretic concepts. The majority of the theorems mentioned in the sections Galois theory, Constructing fields and Elementary notions can be found in Steinitz&#x27;s work. linked the notion of orderings in a field, and thus the area of analysis, to purely algebraic properties. Emil Artin redeveloped Galois theory from 1928 through 1942, eliminating the dependency on the primitive element theorem.

== Constructing fields ==

=== Constructing fields from rings ===
A commutative ring is a set that is equipped with an addition and multiplication operation and satisfies all the axioms of a field, except for the existence of multiplicative inverses . For example, the integers form a commutative ring, but not a field: the reciprocal of an integer is not itself an integer, unless .

In the hierarchy of algebraic structures fields can be characterized as the commutative rings in which every nonzero element is a unit (which means every element is invertible). Similarly, fields are the commutative rings with precisely two distinct ideals, and . Fields are also precisely the commutative rings in which is the only prime ideal.

Given a commutative ring , there are two ways to construct a field related to , i.e., two ways of modifying such that all nonzero elements become invertible: forming the field of fractions, and forming residue fields. The field of fractions of is , the rationals, while the residue fields of are the finite fields .

==== Field of fractions ====
Given an integral domain , its field of fractions is built with the fractions of two elements of exactly as Q is constructed from the integers. More precisely, the elements of are the fractions where and are in , and . Two fractions and are equal if and only if . The operation on the fractions work exactly as for rational numbers. For example,
: formula_8
It is straightforward to show that, if the ring is an integral domain, the set of the fractions form a field.

The field of the rational fractions over a field (or an integral domain) is the field of fractions of the polynomial ring . The field of Laurent series
: formula_9
over a field is the field of fractions of the ring of formal power series (in which ). Since any Laurent series is a fraction of a power series divided by a power of (as opposed to an arbitrary power series), the representation of fractions is less important in this situation, though.

==== Residue fields ====
In addition to the field of fractions, which embeds injectively into a field, a field can be obtained from a commutative ring by means of a surjective map onto a field . Any field obtained in this way is a quotient , where is a maximal ideal of . If has only one maximal ideal , this field is called the residue field of .

The ideal generated by a single polynomial in the polynomial ring (over a field ) is maximal if and only if is irreducible in , i.e., if cannot be expressed as the product of two polynomials in of smaller degree. This yields a field
This field contains an element (namely the residue class of ) which satisfies the equation
For example, is obtained from by adjoining the imaginary unit symbol , which satisfies , where . Moreover, is irreducible over , which implies that the map that sends a polynomial to yields an isomorphism
: formula_10

=== Constructing fields within a bigger field ===
Fields can be constructed inside a given bigger container field. Suppose given a field , and a field containing as a subfield. For any element of , there is a smallest subfield of containing and , called the subfield of &quot;F&quot; generated by and denoted . The passage from to is referred to by &quot;adjoining an element&quot; to . More generally, for a subset , there is a minimal subfield of containing and , denoted by .

The compositum of two subfields and of some field is the smallest subfield of containing both and . The compositum can be used to construct the biggest subfield of satisfying a certain property, for example the biggest subfield of , which is, in the language introduced below, algebraic over .

=== Field extensions ===

The notion of a subfield can also be regarded from the opposite point of view, by referring to being a &quot;field extension&quot; (or just extension) of , denoted by
and read &quot; over &quot;.

A basic datum of a field extension is its degree , i.e., the dimension of as an -vector space. It satisfies the formula
Extensions whose degree is finite are referred to as finite extensions. The extensions and are of degree , whereas is an infinite extension.

==== Algebraic extensions ====
A pivotal notion in the study of field extensions are algebraic elements. An element is &quot;algebraic&quot; over if it is a root of a polynomial with coefficients in , that is, if it satisfies a polynomial equation
with in , and .
For example, the imaginary unit in is algebraic over , and even over , since it satisfies the equation
A field extension in which every element of is algebraic over is called an algebraic extension. Any finite extension is necessarily algebraic, as can be deduced from the above multiplicativity formula.

The subfield generated by an element , as above, is an algebraic extension of if and only if is an algebraic element. That is to say, if is algebraic, all other elements of are necessarily algebraic as well. Moreover, the degree of the extension , i.e., the dimension of as an -vector space, equals the minimal degree such that there is a polynomial equation involving , as above. If this degree is , then the elements of have the form
: formula_11

For example, the field of Gaussian rationals is the subfield of consisting of all numbers of the form where both and are rational numbers: summands of the form (and similarly for higher exponents) do not have to be considered here, since can be simplified to .

==== Transcendence bases ====
The above-mentioned field of rational fractions , where is an indeterminate, is not an algebraic extension of since there is no polynomial equation with coefficients in whose zero is . Elements, such as , which are not algebraic are called transcendental. Informally speaking, the indeterminate and its powers do not interact with elements of . A similar construction can be carried out with a set of indeterminates, instead of just one.

Once again, the field extension discussed above is a key example: if is not algebraic (i.e., is not a root of a polynomial with coefficients in ), then is isomorphic to . This isomorphism is obtained by substituting to in rational fractions.

A subset of a field is a transcendence basis if it is algebraically independent (do not satisfy any polynomial relations) over and if is an algebraic extension of . Any field extension has a transcendence basis. Thus, field extensions can be split into ones of the form (purely transcendental extensions) and algebraic extensions.

=== Closure operations ===
A field is algebraically closed if it does not have any strictly bigger algebraic extensions or, equivalently, if any polynomial equation
: , with coefficients ,
has a solution . By the fundamental theorem of algebra, is algebraically closed, i.e., &quot;any&quot; polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution. The rational and the real numbers are &quot;not&quot; algebraically closed since the equation
does not have any rational or real solution. A field containing is called an &quot;algebraic closure&quot; of if it is algebraic over (roughly speaking, not too big compared to ) and is algebraically closed (big enough to contain solutions of all polynomial equations).

By the above, is an algebraic closure of . The situation that the algebraic closure is a finite extension of the field is quite special: by the Artin–Schreier theorem, the degree of this extension is necessarily , and is elementarily equivalent to . Such fields are also known as real closed fields.

Any field has an algebraic closure, which is moreover unique up to (non-unique) isomorphism. It is commonly referred to as &quot;the&quot; algebraic closure and denoted . For example, the algebraic closure of is called the field of algebraic numbers. The field is usually rather implicit since its construction requires the ultrafilter lemma, a set-theoretic axiom that is weaker than the axiom of choice. In this regard, the algebraic closure of , is exceptionally simple. It is the union of the finite fields containing (the ones of order ). For any algebraically closed field of characteristic , the algebraic closure of the field of Laurent series is the field of Puiseux series, obtained by adjoining roots of .

== Fields with additional structure ==
Since fields are ubiquitous in mathematics and beyond, several refinements of the concept have been adapted to the needs of particular mathematical areas.

=== Ordered fields ===

A field &quot;F&quot; is called an &quot;ordered field&quot; if any two elements can be compared, so that and whenever and . For example, the real numbers form an ordered field, with the usual ordering . The Artin–Schreier theorem states that a field can be ordered if and only if it is a formally real field, which means that any quadratic equation
: formula_12
only has the solution . The set of all possible orders on a fixed field is isomorphic to the set of ring homomorphisms from the Witt ring of quadratic forms over , to .

An Archimedean field is an ordered field such that for each element there exists a finite expression
whose value is greater than that element, that is, there are no infinite elements. Equivalently, the field contains no infinitesimals (elements smaller than all rational numbers); or, yet equivalent, the field is isomorphic to a subfield of .
An ordered field is Dedekind-complete if all upper bounds, lower bounds (see &quot;Dedekind cut&quot;) and limits, which should exist, do exist. More formally, each bounded subset of is required to have a least upper bound. Any complete field is necessarily Archimedean, since in any non-Archimedean field there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, whence the sequence , every element of which is greater than every infinitesimal, has no limit.

Since every proper subfield of the reals also contains such gaps, is the unique complete ordered field, up to isomorphism. Several foundational results in calculus follow directly from this characterization of the reals.

The hyperreals form an ordered field that is not Archimedean. It is an extension of the reals obtained by including infinite and infinitesimal numbers. These are larger, respectively smaller than any real number. The hyperreals form the foundational basis of non-standard analysis.

=== Topological fields ===
Another refinement of the notion of a field is a topological field, in which the set is a topological space, such that all operations of the field (addition, multiplication, the maps and ) are continuous maps with respect to the topology of the space.
The topology of all the fields discussed below is induced from a metric, i.e., a function
that measures a &quot;distance&quot; between any two elements of .

The completion of is another field in which, informally speaking, the &quot;gaps&quot; in the original field are filled, if there are any. For example, any irrational number , such as , is a &quot;gap&quot; in the rationals in the sense that it is a real number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers , in the sense that distance of and given by the absolute value is as small as desired.
The following table lists some examples of this construction. The fourth column shows an example of a zero sequence, i.e., a sequence whose limit (for ) is zero.

The field is used in number theory and -adic analysis. The algebraic closure carries a unique norm extending the one on , but is not complete. The completion of this algebraic closure, however, is algebraically closed. Because of its rough analogy to the complex numbers, it is sometimes called the field of complex &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers and is denoted by .

==== Local fields ====
The following topological fields are called &quot;local fields&quot;:
* finite extensions of (local fields of characteristic zero)
* finite extensions of , the field of Laurent series over (local fields of characteristic ).

These two types of local fields share some fundamental similarities. In this relation, the elements and (referred to as uniformizer) correspond to each other. The first manifestation of this is at an elementary level: the elements of both fields can be expressed as power series in the uniformizer, with coefficients in . (However, since the addition in is done using carrying, which is not the case in , these fields are not isomorphic.) The following facts show that this superficial similarity goes much deeper:
* Any first-order statement that is true for almost all is also true for almost all . An application of this is the Ax–Kochen theorem describing zeros of homogeneous polynomials in .
* Tamely ramified extensions of both fields are in bijection to one another.
* Adjoining arbitrary -power roots of (in ), respectively of (in ), yields (infinite) extensions of these fields known as perfectoid fields. Strikingly, the Galois groups of these two fields are isomorphic, which is the first glimpse of a remarkable parallel between these two fields: formula_13

=== Differential fields ===
Differential fields are fields equipped with a derivation, i.e., allow to take derivatives of elements in the field. For example, the field , together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to differential Galois theory, a variant of Galois theory dealing with linear differential equations.

== Galois theory ==
Galois theory studies algebraic extensions of a field by studying the symmetry in the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. An important notion in this area is that of finite Galois extensions , which are, by definition, those that are separable and normal. The primitive element theorem shows that finite separable extensions are necessarily simple, i.e., of the form
where is an irreducible polynomial (as above). For such an extension, being normal and separable means that all zeros of are contained in and that has only simple zeros. The latter condition is always satisfied if has characteristic .

For a finite Galois extension, the Galois group is the group of field automorphisms of that are trivial on (i.e., the bijections that preserve addition and multiplication and that send elements of to themselves). The importance of this group stems from the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, which constructs an explicit one-to-one correspondence between the set of subgroups of and the set of intermediate extensions of the extension . By means of this correspondence, group-theoretic properties translate into facts about fields. For example, if the Galois group of a Galois extension as above is not solvable (cannot be built from abelian groups), then the zeros of &quot;cannot&quot; be expressed in terms of addition, multiplication, and radicals, i.e., expressions involving formula_14. For example, the symmetric groups is not solvable for . Consequently, as can be shown, the zeros of the following polynomials are not expressible by sums, products, and radicals. For the latter polynomial, this fact is known as the Abel–Ruffini theorem:
: (and ),
: (where is regarded as a polynomial in , for some indeterminates , is any field, and ).

The tensor product of fields is not usually a field. For example, a finite extension of degree is a Galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of -algebras
This fact is the beginning of Grothendieck&#x27;s Galois theory, a far-reaching extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.

== Invariants of fields ==
Basic invariants of a field include the characteristic and the transcendence degree of over its prime field. The latter is defined as the maximal number of elements in that are algebraically independent over the prime field. Two algebraically closed fields and are isomorphic precisely if these two data agree. This implies that any two uncountable algebraically closed fields of the same cardinality and the same characteristic are isomorphic. For example, and are isomorphic (but &quot;not&quot; isomorphic as topological fields).

=== Model theory of fields ===
In model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, two fields and are called elementarily equivalent if every mathematical statement that is true for is also true for and conversely. The mathematical statements in question are required to be first-order sentences (involving , , the addition and multiplication). A typical example, for , an integer, is
: = &quot;any polynomial of degree in has a zero in &quot;
The set of such formulas for all expresses that is algebraically closed.
The Lefschetz principle states that is elementarily equivalent to any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Moreover, any fixed statement holds in if and only if it holds in any algebraically closed field of sufficiently high characteristic.

If is an ultrafilter on a set , and is a field for every in , the ultraproduct of the with respect to is a field. It is denoted by
since it behaves in several ways as a limit of the fields : Łoś&#x27;s theorem states that any first order statement that holds for all but finitely many , also holds for the ultraproduct. Applied to the above sentence , this shows that there is an isomorphism
: formula_15
The Ax–Kochen theorem mentioned above also follows from this and an isomorphism of the ultraproducts (in both cases over all primes )
In addition, model theory also studies the logical properties of various other types of fields, such as real closed fields or exponential fields (which are equipped with an exponential function ).

=== Absolute Galois group ===
For fields that are not algebraically closed (or not separably closed), the absolute Galois group is fundamentally important: extending the case of finite Galois extensions outlined above, this group governs &quot;all&quot; finite separable extensions of . By elementary means, the group can be shown to be the Prüfer group, the profinite completion of . This statement subsumes the fact that the only algebraic extensions of are the fields for , and that the Galois groups of these finite extensions are given by
A description in terms of generators and relations is also known for the Galois groups of -adic number fields (finite extensions of ).

Representations of Galois groups and of related groups such as the Weil group are fundamental in many branches of arithmetic, such as the Langlands program. The cohomological study of such representations is done using Galois cohomology. For example, the Brauer group, which is classically defined as the group of central simple -algebras, can be reinterpreted as a Galois cohomology group, namely

=== K-theory ===
Milnor K-theory is defined as
: formula_16
The norm residue isomorphism theorem, proved around 2000 by Vladimir Voevodsky, relates this to Galois cohomology by means of an isomorphism
: formula_17
Algebraic K-theory is related to the group of invertible matrices with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the determinant of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism . Matsumoto&#x27;s theorem shows that agrees with . In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.

== Applications ==

=== Linear algebra and commutative algebra ===
If , then the equation
has a unique solution in a field , namely formula_18 This immediate consequence of the definition of a field is fundamental in linear algebra. For example, it is an essential ingredient of Gaussian elimination and of the proof that any vector space has a basis.

The theory of modules (the analogue of vector spaces over rings instead of fields) is much more complicated, because the above equation may have several or no solutions. In particular systems of linear equations over a ring are much more difficult to solve than in the case of fields, even in the specially simple case of the ring of the integers.

=== Finite fields: cryptography and coding theory ===

A widely applied cryptographic routine uses the fact that discrete exponentiation, i.e., computing
: ( factors, for an integer )
in a (large) finite field can be performed much more efficiently than the discrete logarithm, which is the inverse operation, i.e., determining the solution to an equation
In elliptic curve cryptography, the multiplication in a finite field is replaced by the operation of adding points on an elliptic curve, i.e., the solutions of an equation of the form

Finite fields are also used in coding theory and combinatorics.

=== Geometry: field of functions ===

Functions on a suitable topological space into a field can be added and multiplied pointwise, e.g., the product of two functions is defined by the product of their values within the domain:
This makes these functions a -commutative algebra.

For having a &quot;field&quot; of functions, one must consider algebras of functions that are integral domains. In this case the ratios of two functions, i.e., expressions of the form
: formula_19
form a field, called field of functions.

This occurs in two main cases. When is a complex manifold . In this case, one considers the algebra of holomorphic functions, i.e., complex differentiable functions. Their ratios form the field of meromorphic functions on .

The function field of an algebraic variety (a geometric object defined as the common zeros of polynomial equations) consists of ratios of regular functions, i.e., ratios of polynomial functions on the variety. The function field of the -dimensional space over a field is , i.e., the field consisting of ratios of polynomials in indeterminates. The function field of is the same as the one of any open dense subvariety. In other words, the function field is insensitive to replacing by a (slightly) smaller subvariety.

The function field is invariant under isomorphism and birational equivalence of varieties. It is therefore an important tool for the study of abstract algebraic varieties and for the classification of algebraic varieties. For example, the dimension, which equals the transcendence degree of , is invariant under birational equivalence. For curves (i.e., the dimension is one), the function field is very close to : if is smooth and proper (the analogue of being compact), can be reconstructed, up to isomorphism, from its field of functions. In higher dimension the function field remembers less, but still decisive information about . The study of function fields and their geometric meaning in higher dimensions is referred to as birational geometry. The minimal model program attempts to identify the simplest (in a certain precise sense) algebraic varieties with a prescribed function field.

=== Number theory: global fields ===
Global fields are in the limelight in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry.
They are, by definition, number fields (finite extensions of ) or function fields over (finite extensions of ). As for local fields, these two types of fields share several similar features, even though they are of characteristic and positive characteristic, respectively. This function field analogy can help to shape mathematical expectations, often first by understanding questions about function fields, and later treating the number field case. The latter is often more difficult. For example, the Riemann hypothesis concerning the zeros of the Riemann zeta function (open as of 2017) can be regarded as being parallel to the Weil conjectures (proven in 1974 by Pierre Deligne).
Cyclotomic fields are among the most intensely studied number fields. They are of the form , where is a primitive th root of unity, i.e., a complex number that satisfies and for all . For being a regular prime, Kummer used cyclotomic fields to prove Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, which asserts the non-existence of rational nonzero solutions to the equation

Local fields are completions of global fields. Ostrowski&#x27;s theorem asserts that the only completions of , a global field, are the local fields and . Studying arithmetic questions in global fields may sometimes be done by looking at the corresponding questions locally. This technique is called the local–global principle. For example, the Hasse–Minkowski theorem reduces the problem of finding rational solutions of quadratic equations to solving these equations in and , whose solutions can easily be described.

Unlike for local fields, the Galois groups of global fields are not known. Inverse Galois theory studies the (unsolved) problem whether any finite group is the Galois group for some number field . Class field theory describes the abelian extensions, i.e., ones with abelian Galois group, or equivalently the abelianized Galois groups of global fields. A classical statement, the Kronecker–Weber theorem, describes the maximal abelian extension of : it is the field
obtained by adjoining all primitive th roots of unity. Kronecker&#x27;s Jugendtraum asks for a similarly explicit description of of general number fields . For imaginary quadratic fields, formula_20, , the theory of complex multiplication describes using elliptic curves. For general number fields, no such explicit description is known.

== Related notions ==
In addition to the additional structure that fields may enjoy, fields admit various other related notions. Since in any field , any field has at least two elements. Nonetheless, there is a concept of field with one element, which is suggested to be a limit of the finite fields , as tends to . In addition to division rings, there are various other weaker algebraic structures related to fields such as quasifields, near-fields and semifields.

There are also proper classes with field structure, which are sometimes called Fields, with a capital &#x27;F&#x27;. The surreal numbers form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for the fact that they are a proper class, not a set. The nimbers, a concept from game theory, form such a Field as well.

=== Division rings ===
Dropping one or several axioms in the definition of a field leads to other algebraic structures. As was mentioned above, commutative rings satisfy all field axioms except for the existence of multiplicative inverses. Dropping instead commutativity of multiplication leads to the concept of a &quot;division ring&quot; or &quot;skew field&quot;; sometimes associativity is weakened as well. The only division rings that are finite-dimensional -vector spaces are itself, (which is a field), and the quaternions (in which multiplication is non-commutative). This result is known as the Frobenius theorem. The octonions , for which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative, is a normed alternative division algebra, but is not a division ring. This fact was proved using methods of algebraic topology in 1958 by Michel Kervaire, Raoul Bott, and John Milnor. 

Wedderburn&#x27;s little theorem states that all finite division rings are fields.

<text>In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative denoted is the product of all positive integers less than or equal The factorial also equals the product of formula_1 with the next smaller factorial:
formula_2
For example,
formula_3
The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.

Factorials have been discovered in several ancient cultures, notably in Indian mathematics in the canonical works of Jain literature, and by Jewish mystics in the Talmudic book &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;. The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in combinatorics, where its most basic use counts the possible distinct sequences – the permutations – of formula_1 distinct objects: there In mathematical analysis, factorials are used in power series for the exponential function and other functions, and they also have applications in algebra, number theory, probability theory, and computer science.

Much of the mathematics of the factorial function was developed beginning in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
Stirling&#x27;s approximation provides an accurate approximation to the factorial of large numbers, showing that it grows more quickly than exponential growth. Legendre&#x27;s formula describes the exponents of the prime numbers in a prime factorization of the factorials, and can be used to count the trailing zeros of the factorials. Daniel Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler interpolated the factorial function to a continuous function of complex numbers, except at the negative integers, the (offset) gamma function.

Many other notable functions and number sequences are closely related to the factorials, including the binomial coefficients, double factorials, falling factorials, primorials, and subfactorials. Implementations of the factorial function are commonly used as an example of different computer programming styles, and are included in scientific calculators and scientific computing software libraries. Although directly computing large factorials using the product formula or recurrence is not efficient, faster algorithms are known, matching to within a constant factor the time for fast multiplication algorithms for numbers with the same number of digits.

==History==
The concept of factorials has arisen independently in many cultures:
*In Indian mathematics, one of the earliest known descriptions of factorials comes from the Anuyogadvāra-sūtra, one of the canonical works of Jain literature, which has been assigned dates varying from 300 BCE to 400 CE. It separates out the sorted and reversed order of a set of items from the other (&quot;mixed&quot;) orders, evaluating the number of mixed orders by subtracting two from the usual product formula for the factorial. The product rule for permutations was also described by 6th-century CE Jain monk Jinabhadra. Hindu scholars have been using factorial formulas since at least 1150, when Bhāskara II mentioned factorials in his work Līlāvatī, in connection with a problem of how many ways Vishnu could hold his four characteristic objects (a conch shell, discus, mace, and lotus flower) in his four hands, and a similar problem for a ten-handed god.
*In the mathematics of the Middle East, the Hebrew mystic book of creation &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;, from the Talmudic period (200 to 500 CE), lists factorials up to 7! as part of an investigation into the number of words that can be formed from the Hebrew alphabet. Factorials were also studied for similar reasons by 8th-century Arab grammarian Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi. Arab mathematician Ibn al-Haytham (also known as Alhazen, c. 965 – c. 1040) was the first to formulate Wilson&#x27;s theorem connecting the factorials with the prime numbers.
*In Europe, although Greek mathematics included some combinatorics, and Plato famously used 5,040 (a factorial) as the population of an ideal community, in part because of its divisibility properties, there is no direct evidence of ancient Greek study of factorials. Instead, the first work on factorials in Europe was by Jewish scholars such as Shabbethai Donnolo, explicating the Sefer Yetzirah passage. In 1677, British author Fabian Stedman described the application of factorials to change ringing, a musical art involving the ringing of several tuned bells.

From the late 15th century onward, factorials became the subject of study by Western mathematicians. In a 1494 treatise, Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli calculated factorials up to 11!, in connection with a problem of dining table arrangements. Christopher Clavius discussed factorials in a 1603 commentary on the work of Johannes de Sacrobosco, and in the 1640s, French polymath Marin Mersenne published large (but not entirely correct) tables of factorials, up to 64!, based on the work of Clavius. The power series for the exponential function, with the reciprocals of factorials for its coefficients, was first formulated in 1676 by Isaac Newton in a letter to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Other important works of early European mathematics on factorials include extensive coverage in a 1685 treatise by John Wallis, a study of their approximate values for large values of formula_1 by Abraham de Moivre in 1721, a 1729 letter from James Stirling to de Moivre stating what became known as Stirling&#x27;s approximation, and work at the same time by Daniel Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler formulating the continuous extension of the factorial function to the gamma function. Adrien-Marie Legendre included Legendre&#x27;s formula, describing the exponents in the factorization of factorials into prime powers, in an 1808 text on number theory.

The notation formula_6 for factorials was introduced by the French mathematician Christian Kramp in 1808. Many other notations have also been used. Another later notation formula_7, in which the argument of the factorial was half-enclosed by the left and bottom sides of a box, was popular for some time in Britain and America but fell out of use, perhaps because it is difficult to typeset. The word &quot;factorial&quot; (originally French: &quot;factorielle&quot;) was first used in 1800 by Louis François Antoine Arbogast, in the first work on Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula, but referring to a more general concept of products of arithmetic progressions. The &quot;factors&quot; that this name refers to are the terms of the product formula for the factorial.

==Definition==
The factorial function of a positive integer formula_1 is defined by the product of all positive integers not greater than formula_1
formula_10
This may be written more concisely in product notation as
formula_11

If this product formula is changed to keep all but the last term, it would define a product of the same form, for a smaller factorial. This leads to a recurrence relation, according to which each value of the factorial function can be obtained by multiplying the previous value 
formula_12
For example, 

===Factorial of zero===
The factorial or in symbols, There are several motivations for this definition:
* For the definition of formula_6 as a product involves the product of no numbers at all, and so is an example of the broader convention that the empty product, a product of no factors, is equal to the multiplicative identity.
* There is exactly one permutation of zero objects: with nothing to permute, the only rearrangement is to do nothing.
* This convention makes many identities in combinatorics valid for all valid choices of their parameters. For instance, the number of ways to choose all formula_1 elements from a set of formula_1 is formula_16 a binomial coefficient identity that would only be valid 
* With the recurrence relation for the factorial remains valid Therefore, with this convention, a recursive computation of the factorial needs to have only the value for zero as a base case, simplifying the computation and avoiding the need for additional special cases.
* Setting formula_17 allows for the compact expression of many formulae, such as the exponential function, as a power series: 
* This choice matches the gamma function and the gamma function must have this value to be a continuous function.

==Applications==
The earliest uses of the factorial function involve counting permutations: there are formula_6 different ways of arranging formula_1 distinct objects into a sequence. Factorials appear more broadly in many formulas in combinatorics, to account for different orderings of objects. For instance the binomial coefficients formula_20 count the combinations (subsets of from a set with and can be computed from factorials using the formula formula_21 The Stirling numbers of the first kind sum to the factorials, and count the permutations grouped into subsets with the same numbers of cycles. Another combinatorial application is in counting derangements, permutations that do not leave any element in its original position; the number of derangements of formula_1 items is the nearest integer 

In algebra, the factorials arise through the binomial theorem, which uses binomial coefficients to expand powers of sums. They also occur in the coefficients used to relate certain families of polynomials to each other, for instance in Newton&#x27;s identities for symmetric polynomials. Their use in counting permutations can also be restated algebraically: the factorials are the orders of finite symmetric groups. In calculus, factorials occur in Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula for chaining higher derivatives. In mathematical analysis, factorials frequently appear in the denominators of power series, most notably in the series for the exponential function, formula_23
and in the coefficients of other Taylor series (in particular those of the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions), where they cancel factors of formula_6 coming from the This usage of factorials in power series connects back to analytic combinatorics through the exponential generating function, which for a combinatorial class with formula_25 elements of is defined as the power series formula_26

In number theory, the most salient property of factorials is the divisibility of formula_6 by all positive integers up described more precisely for prime factors by Legendre&#x27;s formula. It follows that arbitrarily large prime numbers can be found as the prime factors of the numbers
formula_28, leading to a proof of Euclid&#x27;s theorem that the number of primes is infinite. When formula_28 is itself prime it is called a factorial prime; relatedly, Brocard&#x27;s problem, also posed by Srinivasa Ramanujan, concerns the existence of square numbers of the form In contrast, the numbers formula_30 must all be composite, proving the existence of arbitrarily large prime gaps. An elementary proof of Bertrand&#x27;s postulate on the existence of a prime in any interval of the one of the first results of Paul Erdős, was based on the divisibility properties of factorials. The factorial number system is a mixed radix notation for numbers in which the place values of each digit are factorials.

Factorials are used extensively in probability theory, for instance in the Poisson distribution and in the probabilities of random permutations. In computer science, beyond appearing in the analysis of brute-force searches over permutations, factorials arise in the lower bound of formula_31 on the number of comparisons needed to comparison sort a set of formula_1 items, and in the analysis of chained hash tables, where the distribution of keys per cell can be accurately approximated by a Poisson distribution. Moreover, factorials naturally appear in formulae from quantum and statistical physics, where one often considers all the possible permutations of a set of particles. In statistical mechanics, calculations of entropy such as Boltzmann&#x27;s entropy formula or the Sackur–Tetrode equation must correct the count of microstates by dividing by the factorials of the numbers of each type of indistinguishable particle to avoid the Gibbs paradox. Quantum physics provides the underlying reason for why these corrections are necessary.

==Properties==
===Growth and approximation===


As a function the factorial has faster than exponential growth, but grows more slowly than a double exponential function. Its growth rate is similar but slower by an exponential factor. One way of approaching this result is by taking the natural logarithm of the factorial, which turns its product formula into a sum, and then estimating the sum by an integral:
formula_33
Exponentiating the result (and ignoring the negligible formula_34 term) approximates formula_6 as 
More carefully bounding the sum both above and below by an integral, using the trapezoid rule, shows that this estimate needs a correction factor proportional The constant of proportionality for this correction can be found from the Wallis product, which expresses formula_36 as a limiting ratio of factorials and powers of two. The result of these corrections is Stirling&#x27;s approximation:
formula_37
Here, the formula_38 symbol means that, as formula_1 goes to infinity, the ratio between the left and right sides approaches one in the limit.
Stirling&#x27;s formula provides the first term in an asymptotic series that becomes even more accurate when taken to greater numbers of terms:
formula_40
An alternative version uses only odd exponents in the correction terms:
formula_41
Many other variations of these formulas have also been developed, by Srinivasa Ramanujan, Bill Gosper, and others.

The binary logarithm of the factorial, used to analyze comparison sorting, can be very accurately estimated using Stirling&#x27;s approximation. In the formula below, the formula_42 term invokes big O notation.
formula_43

===Divisibility and digits===

The product formula for the factorial implies that formula_6 is divisible by all prime numbers that are at and by no larger prime numbers. More precise information about its divisibility is given by Legendre&#x27;s formula, which gives the exponent of each prime formula_45 in the prime factorization of formula_6 as
formula_47
Here formula_48 denotes the sum of the digits and the exponent given by this formula can also be interpreted in advanced mathematics as the -adic valuation of the factorial. Applying Legendre&#x27;s formula to the product formula for binomial coefficients produces Kummer&#x27;s theorem, a similar result on the exponent of each prime in the factorization of a binomial coefficient. Grouping the prime factors of the factorial into prime powers in different ways produces the multiplicative partitions of factorials.

The special case of Legendre&#x27;s formula for formula_49 gives the number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of the factorials. According to this formula, the number of zeros can be obtained by subtracting the base-5 digits of formula_1 from formula_1, and dividing the result by four. Legendre&#x27;s formula implies that the exponent of the prime formula_52 is always larger than the exponent for so each factor of five can be paired with a factor of two to produce one of these trailing zeros. The leading digits of the factorials are distributed according to Benford&#x27;s law. Every sequence of digits, in any base, is the sequence of initial digits of some factorial number in that base.

Another result on divisibility of factorials, Wilson&#x27;s theorem, states that formula_53 is divisible by formula_1 if and only if formula_1 is a prime number. For any given the Kempner function of formula_56 is given by the smallest formula_1 for which formula_56 divides For almost all numbers (all but a subset of exceptions with asymptotic density zero), it coincides with the largest prime factor 

The product of two factorials, always evenly divides There are infinitely many factorials that equal the product of other factorials: if formula_1 is itself any product of factorials, then formula_6 equals that same product multiplied by one more factorial, The only known examples of factorials that are products of other factorials but are not of this &quot;trivial&quot; form are and It would follow from the conjecture that there are only finitely many nontrivial examples.

The greatest common divisor of the values of a primitive polynomial of degree formula_61 over the integers evenly divides 

===Continuous interpolation and non-integer generalization===

There are infinitely many ways to extend the factorials to a continuous function. The most widely used of these uses the gamma function, which can be defined for positive real numbers as the integral
formula_62
The resulting function is related to the factorial of a non-negative integer formula_1 by the equation
formula_64
which can be used as a definition of the factorial for non-integer arguments.
At all values formula_56 for which both formula_66 and formula_67 are defined, the gamma function obeys the functional equation
formula_68
generalizing the recurrence relation for the factorials.

The same integral converges more generally for any complex number formula_69 whose real part is positive. It can be extended to the non-integer points in the rest of the complex plane by solving for Euler&#x27;s reflection formula
formula_70
However, this formula cannot be used at integers because, for them, the formula_71 term would produce a division by zero. The result of this extension process is an analytic function, the analytic continuation of the integral formula for the gamma function. It has a nonzero value at all complex numbers, except for the non-positive integers where it has simple poles. Correspondingly, this provides a definition for the factorial at all complex numbers other than the negative integers.
One property of the gamma function, distinguishing it from other continuous interpolations of the factorials, is given by the Bohr–Mollerup theorem, which states that the gamma function (offset by one) is the only log-convex function on the positive real numbers that interpolates the factorials and obeys the same functional equation. A related uniqueness theorem of Helmut Wielandt states that the complex gamma function and its scalar multiples are the only holomorphic functions on the positive complex half-plane that obey the functional equation and remain bounded for complex numbers with real part between 1 and 2.

Other complex functions that interpolate the factorial values include Hadamard&#x27;s gamma function, which is an entire function over all the complex numbers, including the non-positive integers. In the -adic numbers, it is not possible to continuously interpolate the factorial function directly, because the factorials of large integers (a dense subset of the -adics) converge to zero according to Legendre&#x27;s formula, forcing any continuous function that is close to their values to be zero everywhere. Instead, the -adic gamma function provides a continuous interpolation of a modified form of the factorial, omitting the factors in the factorial that are divisible by .

The digamma function is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function. Just as the gamma function provides a continuous interpolation of the factorials, offset by one, the digamma function provides a continuous interpolation of the harmonic numbers, offset by the Euler–Mascheroni constant.

===Computation===

The factorial function is a common feature in scientific calculators. It is also included in scientific programming libraries such as the Python mathematical functions module and the Boost C++ library. If efficiency is not a concern, computing factorials is trivial: just successively multiply a variable initialized by the integers up The simplicity of this computation makes it a common example in the use of different computer programming styles and methods.

The computation of formula_6 can be expressed in pseudocode using iteration as
 define factorial(&quot;n&quot;):
 &quot;f&quot; := 1
 for &quot;i&quot; := 1, 2, 3, ..., &quot;n&quot;:
 &quot;f&quot; := &quot;f&quot; * &quot;i&quot;
 return &quot;f&quot;
or using recursion based on its recurrence relation as
 define factorial(&quot;n&quot;):
 if (&quot;n&quot; = 0) return 1
 return &quot;n&quot; * factorial(&quot;n&quot; − 1)
Other methods suitable for its computation include memoization, dynamic programming, and functional programming. The computational complexity of these algorithms may be analyzed using the unit-cost random-access machine model of computation, in which each arithmetic operation takes constant time and each number uses a constant amount of storage space. In this model, these methods can compute formula_6 in time and the iterative version uses space Unless optimized for tail recursion, the recursive version takes linear space to store its call stack. However, this model of computation is only suitable when formula_1 is small enough to allow formula_6 to fit into a machine word. The values 12! and 20! are the largest factorials that can be stored in, respectively, the 32-bit and 64-bit integers. Floating point can represent larger factorials, but approximately rather than exactly, and will still overflow for factorials larger than 

The exact computation of larger factorials involves arbitrary-precision arithmetic, because of fast growth and integer overflow. Time of computation can be analyzed as a function of the number of digits or bits in the result. By Stirling&#x27;s formula, formula_6 has formula_77 bits. The Schönhage–Strassen algorithm can produce a product in time and faster multiplication algorithms taking time formula_78 are known. However, computing the factorial involves repeated products, rather than a single multiplication, so these time bounds do not apply directly. In this setting, computing formula_6 by multiplying the numbers from 1 in sequence is inefficient, because it involves formula_1 multiplications, a constant fraction of which take time formula_81 each, giving total time A better approach is to perform the multiplications as a divide-and-conquer algorithm that multiplies a sequence of formula_82 numbers by splitting it into two subsequences of formula_83 numbers, multiplies each subsequence, and combines the results with one last multiplication. This approach to the factorial takes total time one logarithm comes from the number of bits in the factorial, a second comes from the multiplication algorithm, and a third comes from the divide and conquer.

Even better efficiency is obtained by computing from its prime factorization, based on the principle that exponentiation by squaring is faster than expanding an exponent into a product. An algorithm for this by Arnold Schönhage begins by finding the list of the primes up for instance using the sieve of Eratosthenes, and uses Legendre&#x27;s formula to compute the exponent for each prime. Then it computes the product of the prime powers with these exponents, using a recursive algorithm, as follows:
* Use divide and conquer to compute the product of the primes whose exponents are odd
* Divide all of the exponents by two (rounding down to an integer), recursively compute the product of the prime powers with these smaller exponents, and square the result
* Multiply together the results of the two previous steps
The product of all primes up to formula_1 is an formula_85-bit number, by the prime number theorem, so the time for the first step is formula_81, with one logarithm coming from the divide and conquer and another coming from the multiplication algorithm. In the recursive calls to the algorithm, the prime number theorem can again be invoked to prove that the numbers of bits in the corresponding products decrease by a constant factor at each level of recursion, so the total time for these steps at all levels of recursion adds in a geometric series The time for the squaring in the second step and the multiplication in the third step are again because each is a single multiplication of a number with formula_87 bits. Again, at each level of recursion the numbers involved have a constant fraction as many bits (because otherwise repeatedly squaring them would produce too large a final result) so again the amounts of time for these steps in the recursive calls add in a geometric series Consequentially, the whole algorithm takes proportional to a single multiplication with the same number of bits in its result.
