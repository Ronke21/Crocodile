<text>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.

Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 and summarized in a simple document describing the behavior of a client and a server using the first HTTP version, named 0.9.&lt;ref name=&quot;HTTP/0.9-specifications&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; That version was subsequently developed, eventually becoming the public 1.0.&lt;ref name=&quot;HTTP/1.0-first-unofficial-draft&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of early HTTP Requests for Comments (RFCs) started a few years later in a coordinated effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF.

HTTP/1 was finalized and fully documented (as version 1.0) in 1996. It evolved (as version 1.1) in 1997 and then its specifications were updated in 1999, 2014, and 2022. Its secure variant named HTTPS is used by more than 85% of websites. 

HTTP/2, published in 2015, provides a more efficient expression of HTTP&#x27;s semantics &quot;on the wire&quot;. it is supported by 66.2% of websites (35.3% HTTP/2 + 30.9% HTTP/3 with backwards compatibility) and supported by almost all web browsers (over 98% of users). It is also supported by major web servers over Transport Layer Security (TLS) using an Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension where TLS 1.2 or newer is required.

HTTP/3, the successor to HTTP/2, was published in 2022. it is now used on 30.9% of websites and is supported by most web browsers, i.e. (at least partially) supported by 97% of users. HTTP/3 uses QUIC instead of TCP for the underlying transport protocol. Like HTTP/2, it does not obsolete previous major versions of the protocol. Support for HTTP/3 was added to Cloudflare and Google Chrome first, and is also enabled in Firefox. HTTP/3 has lower latency for real-world web pages, if enabled on the server, and loads faster than with HTTP/2, in some cases over three times faster than HTTP/1.1 (which is still commonly only enabled).

==Technical overview==
HTTP functions as a request–response protocol in the client–server model. A web browser, for example, may be the &quot;client&quot; whereas a process, named web server, running on a computer hosting one or more websites may be the &quot;server&quot;. The client submits an HTTP &quot;request&quot; message to the server. The server, which provides &quot;resources&quot; such as HTML files and other content or performs other functions on behalf of the client, returns a &quot;response&quot; message to the client. The response contains completion status information about the request and may also contain requested content in its message body.

A web browser is an example of a &quot;user agent&quot; (UA). Other types of user agent include the indexing software used by search providers (web crawlers), voice browsers, mobile apps, and other software that accesses, consumes, or displays web content.

HTTP is designed to permit intermediate network elements to improve or enable communications between clients and servers. High-traffic websites often benefit from web cache servers that deliver content on behalf of upstream servers to improve response time. Web browsers cache previously accessed web resources and reuse them, whenever possible, to reduce network traffic. HTTP proxy servers at private network boundaries can facilitate communication for clients without a globally routable address, by relaying messages with external servers.

To allow intermediate HTTP nodes (proxy servers, web caches, etc.) to accomplish their functions, some of the HTTP headers (found in HTTP requests/responses) are managed hop-by-hop whereas other HTTP headers are managed end-to-end (managed only by the source client and by the target web server).

HTTP is an application layer protocol designed within the framework of the Internet protocol suite. Its definition presumes an underlying and reliable transport layer protocol. In HTTP/3, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is no longer used, but the older versions are still more used and they most commonly use TCP. They have also been adapted to use unreliable protocols such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which HTTP/3 also (indirectly) always builds on, for example in HTTPU and Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP).

HTTP resources are identified and located on the network by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), using the Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) schemes &quot;http&quot; and &quot;https&quot;. As defined in , URIs are encoded as hyperlinks in HTML documents, so as to form interlinked hypertext documents.

In HTTP/1.0 a separate TCP connection to the same server is made for every resource request.

In HTTP/1.1 instead a TCP connection can be reused to make multiple resource requests (i.e. of HTML pages, frames, images, scripts, stylesheets, etc.).

HTTP/1.1 communications therefore experience less latency as the establishment of TCP connections presents considerable overhead, especially under high traffic conditions.

HTTP/2 is a revision of previous HTTP/1.1 in order to maintain the same client–server model and the same protocol methods but with these differences in order:
* to use a compressed binary representation of metadata (HTTP headers) instead of a textual one, so that headers require much less space;
* to use a single TCP/IP (usually encrypted) connection per accessed server domain instead of 2 to 8 TCP/IP connections;
* to use one or more bidirectional streams per TCP/IP connection in which HTTP requests and responses are broken down and transmitted in small packets to almost solve the problem of the HOLB (head-of-line blocking).
* to add a push capability to allow server application to send data to clients whenever new data is available (without forcing clients to request periodically new data to server by using polling methods).

HTTP/2 communications therefore experience much less latency and, in most cases, even higher speeds than HTTP/1.1 communications.

HTTP/3 is a revision of previous HTTP/2 in order to use QUIC + UDP transport protocols instead of TCP. Before that version, TCP/IP connections were used; but now, only the IP layer is used (which UDP, like TCP, builds on). This slightly improves the average speed of communications and to avoid the occasional (very rare) problem of TCP connection congestion that can temporarily block or slow down the data flow of all its streams (another form of &quot;head of line blocking&quot;).

== History ==
The term hypertext was coined by Ted Nelson in 1965 in the Xanadu Project, which was in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush&#x27;s 1930s vision of the microfilm-based information retrieval and management &quot;memex&quot; system described in his 1945 essay &quot;As We May Think&quot;. Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN are credited with inventing the original HTTP, along with HTML and the associated technology for a web server and a client user interface called web browser. Berners-Lee designed HTTP in order to help with the adoption of his other idea: the &quot;WorldWideWeb&quot; project, which was first proposed in 1989, now known as the World Wide Web.

The first web server went live in 1990. The protocol used had only one method, namely GET, which would request a page from a server. The response from the server was always an HTML page.

=== Summary of HTTP milestone versions ===
====HTTP/0.9====
In 1991, the first documented official version of HTTP was written as a plain document, less than 700 words long, and this version was named HTTP/0.9, which supported only GET method, allowing clients to only retrieve HTML documents from the server, but not supporting any other file formats or information upload.

====HTTP/1.0-draft====
Since 1992, a new document was written to specify the evolution of the basic protocol towards its next full version. It supported both the simple request method of the 0.9 version and the full GET request that included the client HTTP version. This was the first of the many unofficial HTTP/1.0 drafts that preceded the final work on HTTP/1.0.

====W3C HTTP Working Group====
After having decided that new features of HTTP protocol were required and that they had to be fully documented as official RFCs, in early 1995 the HTTP Working Group (HTTP WG, led by Dave Raggett) was constituted with the aim to standardize and expand the protocol with extended operations, extended negotiation, richer meta-information, tied with a security protocol which became more efficient by adding additional methods and header fields.

The HTTP WG planned to revise and publish new versions of the protocol as HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 within 1995, but, because of the many revisions, that timeline lasted much more than one year.

The HTTP WG planned also to specify a far future version of HTTP called HTTP-NG (HTTP Next Generation) that would have solved all remaining problems, of previous versions, related to performances, low latency responses, etc. but this work started only a few years later and it was never completed.

====HTTP/1.0====
In May 1996, was published as a final HTTP/1.0 revision of what had been used in previous 4 years as a pre-standard HTTP/1.0-draft which was already used by many web browsers and web servers.

In early 1996 developers started to even include unofficial extensions of the HTTP/1.0 protocol (i.e. keep-alive connections, etc.) into their products by using drafts of the upcoming HTTP/1.1 specifications.

====HTTP/1.1====
Since early 1996, major web browsers and web server developers also started to implement new features specified by pre-standard HTTP/1.1 drafts specifications. End-user adoption of the new versions of browsers and servers was rapid. In March 1996, one web hosting company reported that over 40% of browsers in use on the Internet used the new HTTP/1.1 header &quot;Host&quot; to enable virtual hosting, and that by June 1996, 65% of all browsers accessing their servers were pre-standard HTTP/1.1 compliant.

In January 1997, was officially released as HTTP/1.1 specifications.

In June 1999, was released to include all improvements and updates based on previous (obsolete) HTTP/1.1 specifications.

====W3C HTTP-NG Working Group====
Resuming the old 1995 plan of previous HTTP Working Group, in 1997 an &quot;HTTP-NG Working Group&quot; was formed to develop a new HTTP protocol named HTTP-NG (HTTP New Generation). A few proposals / drafts were produced for the new protocol to use multiplexing of HTTP transactions inside a single TCP/IP connection, but in 1999, the group stopped its activity passing the technical problems to IETF.

====IETF HTTP Working Group restarted====
In 2007, the IETF HTTP Working Group (HTTP WG bis or HTTPbis) was restarted firstly to revise and clarify previous HTTP/1.1 specifications and secondly to write and refine future HTTP/2 specifications (named httpbis).

====SPDY: an unofficial HTTP protocol developed by Google====
In 2009, Google, a private company, announced that it had developed and tested a new HTTP binary protocol named SPDY. The implicit aim was to greatly speed up web traffic (specially between future web browsers and its servers).

SPDY was indeed much faster than HTTP/1.1 in many tests and so it was quickly adopted by Chromium and then by other major web browsers.&lt;ref name=&quot;SPDY-vs-HTTP/1.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the ideas about multiplexing HTTP streams over a single TCP/IP connection were taken from various sources, including the work of W3C HTTP-NG Working Group.

====HTTP/2====
In January–March 2012, HTTP Working Group (HTTPbis) announced the need to start to focus on a new HTTP/2 protocol (while finishing the revision of HTTP/1.1 specifications), maybe taking in consideration ideas and work done for SPDY.

After a few months about what to do to develop a new version of HTTP, it was decided to derive it from SPDY.&lt;ref name=&quot;HTTP/2-introduction&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, HTTP/2 was published as and quickly adopted by all web browsers already supporting SPDY and more slowly by web servers.

====2014 updates to HTTP/1.1====
In June 2014, the HTTP Working Group released an updated six-part HTTP/1.1 specification obsoleting :
* , &quot;HTTP/1.1: Message Syntax and Routing&quot;
* , &quot;HTTP/1.1: Semantics and Content&quot;
* , &quot;HTTP/1.1: Conditional Requests&quot;
* , &quot;HTTP/1.1: Range Requests&quot;
* , &quot;HTTP/1.1: Caching&quot;
* , &quot;HTTP/1.1: Authentication&quot;

====HTTP/0.9 Deprecation====
In Appendix-A, HTTP/0.9 was deprecated for servers supporting HTTP/1.1 version (and higher):

Since 2016 many product managers and developers of user agents (browsers, etc.) and web servers have begun planning to gradually deprecate and dismiss support for HTTP/0.9 protocol, mainly for the following reasons:&lt;ref name=&quot;HTTP/0.9-chrome-deprecated&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* it is so simple that an RFC document was never written (there is only the original document);
* it has no HTTP headers and lacks many other features that nowadays are required for minimal security reasons;
* it has not been widespread since 1999..2000 (because of HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1) and is commonly used only by some very old network hardware, i.e. routers, etc.
====HTTP/3====
In 2020, the first drafts HTTP/3 were published and major web browsers and web servers started to adopt it.

On 6 June 2022, IETF standardized HTTP/3 as .

====Updates and refactoring in 2022====
In June 2022, a batch of RFCs was published, deprecating many of the previous documents and introducing a few minor changes and a refactoring of HTTP semantics description into a separate document.
* , &quot;HTTP Semantics&quot;
* , &quot;HTTP Caching&quot;
* , &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot;
* , &quot;HTTP/2&quot;
* , &quot;HTTP/3&quot; (see also the section above)
* , &quot;QPACK: Field Compression for HTTP/3&quot;
* , &quot;Extensible Prioritization Scheme for HTTP&quot;

== HTTP data exchange ==
HTTP is a stateless application-level protocol and it requires a reliable network transport connection to exchange data between client and server. In HTTP implementations, TCP/IP connections are used using well-known ports (typically port 80 if the connection is unencrypted or port 443 if the connection is encrypted, see also List of TCP and UDP port numbers). In HTTP/2, a TCP/IP connection plus multiple protocol channels are used. In HTTP/3, the application transport protocol QUIC over UDP is used.

=== Request and response messages through connections ===
Data is exchanged through a sequence of request–response messages which are exchanged by a session layer transport connection. An HTTP client initially tries to connect to a server establishing a connection (real or virtual). An HTTP(S) server listening on that port accepts the connection and then waits for a client&#x27;s request message. The client sends its HTTP request message. Upon receiving the request the server sends back an HTTP response message, which includes header(s) plus a body if it is required. The body of this response message is typically the requested resource, although an error message or other information may also be returned. At any time (for many reasons) client or server can close the connection. Closing a connection is usually advertised in advance by using one or more HTTP headers in the last request/response message sent to server or client.

=== Persistent connections ===

In HTTP/0.9, the TCP/IP connection is always closed after server response has been sent, so it is never persistent.

In HTTP/1.0, as stated in RFC 1945, the TCP/IP connection should always be closed by server after a response has been sent.

In HTTP/1.1 a keep-alive-mechanism was officially introduced so that a connection could be reused for more than one request/response. Such persistent connections reduce request latency perceptibly because the client does not need to re-negotiate the TCP 3-Way-Handshake connection after the first request has been sent. Another positive side effect is that, in general, the connection becomes faster with time due to TCP&#x27;s slow-start-mechanism.

HTTP/1.1 added also HTTP pipelining in order to further reduce lag time when using persistent connections by allowing clients to send multiple requests before waiting for each response. This optimization was never considered really safe because a few web servers and many proxy servers, specially transparent proxy servers placed in Internet / Intranets between clients and servers, did not handle pipelined requests properly (they served only the first request discarding the others, they closed the connection because they saw more data after the first request or some proxies even returned responses out of order etc.). Because of this, only HEAD and some GET requests (i.e. limited to real file requests and so with URLs without query string used as a command, etc.) could be pipelined in a safe and idempotent mode. After many years of struggling with the problems introduced by enabling pipelining, this feature was first disabled and then removed from most browsers also because of the announced adoption of HTTP/2.

HTTP/2 extended the usage of persistent connections by multiplexing many concurrent requests/responses through a single TCP/IP connection.

HTTP/3 does not use TCP/IP connections but QUIC + UDP (see also: technical overview).

=== Content retrieval optimizations ===
; HTTP/0.9
: A requested resource was always sent in its entirety.
; HTTP/1.0
: HTTP/1.0 added headers to manage resources cached by client in order to allow conditional GET requests; in practice a server has to return the entire content of the requested resource only if its last modified time is not known by client or if it changed since last full response to GET request. One of these headers, &quot;Content-Encoding&quot;, was added to specify whether the returned content of a resource was or was not compressed.
: If the total length of the content of a resource was not known in advance (i.e. because it was dynamically generated, etc.) then the header codice_1 was not present in HTTP headers and the client assumed that when server closed the connection, the content had been sent in its entirety. This mechanism could not distinguish between a resource transfer successfully completed and an interrupted one (because of a server / network error or something else).
; HTTP/1.1
: HTTP/1.1 introduced:
:* new headers to better manage the conditional retrieval of cached resources.
:* chunked transfer encoding to allow content to be streamed in chunks in order to reliably send it even when the server does not know its length in advance (i.e. because it is dynamically generated, etc.).
:* byte range serving, where a client can request only one or more portions (ranges of bytes) of a resource (i.e. the first part, a part in the middle or in the end of the entire content, etc.) and the server usually sends only the requested part(s). This is useful to resume an interrupted download (when a file is very large), when only a part of a content has to be shown or dynamically added to the already visible part by a browser (i.e. only the first or the following n comments of a web page) in order to spare time, bandwidth and system resources, etc.
; HTTP/2, HTTP/3
: Both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 have kept the above mentioned features of HTTP/1.1.

== HTTP authentication ==
HTTP provides multiple authentication schemes such as basic access authentication and digest access authentication which operate via a challenge–response mechanism whereby the server identifies and issues a challenge before serving the requested content.

HTTP provides a general framework for access control and authentication, via an extensible set of challenge–response authentication schemes, which can be used by a server to challenge a client request and by a client to provide authentication information.

The authentication mechanisms described above belong to the HTTP protocol and are managed by client and server HTTP software (if configured to require authentication before allowing client access to one or more web resources), and not by the web applications using a web application session.

=== Authentication realms ===
The HTTP Authentication specification also provides an arbitrary, implementation-specific construct for further dividing resources common to a given root URI. The realm value string, if present, is combined with the canonical root URI to form the protection space component of the challenge. This in effect allows the server to define separate authentication scopes under one root URI.

== HTTP application session ==
HTTP is a stateless protocol. A stateless protocol does not require the web server to retain information or status about each user for the duration of multiple requests.

Some web applications need to manage user sessions, so they implement states, or server side sessions, using for instance HTTP cookies or hidden variables within web forms.

To start an application user session, an interactive authentication via web application login must be performed. To stop a user session a logout operation must be requested by user. These kind of operations do not use HTTP authentication but a custom managed web application authentication.

== HTTP/1.1 request messages ==
Request messages are sent by a client to a target server.

=== Request syntax ===
A client sends &quot;request messages&quot; to the server, which consist of:

* a request line, consisting of the case-sensitive request method, a space, the requested URI, another space, the protocol version, a carriage return, and a line feed, e.g.:

* zero or more request header fields (at least 1 or more headers in case of HTTP/1.1), each consisting of the case-insensitive field name, a colon, optional leading whitespace, the field value, an optional trailing whitespace and ending with a carriage return and a line feed, e.g.:
 Host: www.example.com
 Accept-Language: en
* an empty line, consisting of a carriage return and a line feed;
* an optional message body.

In the HTTP/1.1 protocol, all header fields except codice_2 are optional.

A request line containing only the path name is accepted by servers to maintain compatibility with HTTP clients before the HTTP/1.0 specification in .

=== Request methods ===

HTTP defines methods (sometimes referred to as &quot;verbs&quot;, but nowhere in the specification does it mention &quot;verb&quot;) to indicate the desired action to be performed on the identified resource. What this resource represents, whether pre-existing data or data that is generated dynamically, depends on the implementation of the server. Often, the resource corresponds to a file or the output of an executable residing on the server. The HTTP/1.0 specification defined the GET, HEAD, and POST methods as well as listing the PUT, DELETE, LINK and UNLINK methods under additional methods. However, the HTTP/1.1 specification formally defined and added five new methods: PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, and TRACE. Any client can use any method and the server can be configured to support any combination of methods. If a method is unknown to an intermediate, it will be treated as an unsafe and non-idempotent method. There is no limit to the number of methods that can be defined, which allows for future methods to be specified without breaking existing infrastructure. For example, WebDAV defined seven new methods and specified the PATCH method.

Method names are case sensitive. This is in contrast to HTTP header field names which are case-insensitive.
; GET: The GET method requests that the target resource transfer a representation of its state. GET requests should only retrieve data and should have no other effect. (This is also true of some other HTTP methods.) For retrieving resources without making changes, GET is preferred over POST, as they can be addressed through a URL. This enables bookmarking and sharing and makes GET responses eligible for caching, which can save bandwidth. The W3C has published guidance principles on this distinction, saying, &quot;Web application design should be informed by the above principles, but also by the relevant limitations.&quot; See safe methods below.
; HEAD: The HEAD method requests that the target resource transfer a representation of its state, as for a GET request, but without the representation data enclosed in the response body. This is useful for retrieving the representation metadata in the response header, without having to transfer the entire representation. Uses include checking whether a page is available through the status code and quickly finding the size of a file (codice_3).
; POST: The POST method requests that the target resource process the representation enclosed in the request according to the semantics of the target resource. For example, it is used for posting a message to an Internet forum, subscribing to a mailing list, or completing an online shopping transaction.
; PUT: The PUT method requests that the target resource create or update its state with the state defined by the representation enclosed in the request. A distinction from POST is that the client specifies the target location on the server.
; DELETE: The DELETE method requests that the target resource delete its state.
; CONNECT: The CONNECT method requests that the intermediary establish a TCP/IP tunnel to the origin server identified by the request target. It is often used to secure connections through one or more HTTP proxies with TLS. See HTTP CONNECT method.
; OPTIONS: The OPTIONS method requests that the target resource transfer the HTTP methods that it supports. This can be used to check the functionality of a web server by requesting &#x27;*&#x27; instead of a specific resource.
; TRACE: The TRACE method requests that the target resource transfer the received request in the response body. That way a client can see what (if any) changes or additions have been made by intermediaries.
; PATCH: The PATCH method requests that the target resource modify its state according to the partial update defined in the representation enclosed in the request. This can save bandwidth by updating a part of a file or document without having to transfer it entirely.

All general-purpose web servers are required to implement at least the GET and HEAD methods, and all other methods are considered optional by the specification.


==== Safe methods ====
A request method is &quot;safe&quot; if a request with that method has no intended effect on the server. The methods GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE are defined as safe. In other words, safe methods are intended to be read-only. Safe methods can still have side effects not seen by the client, such as appending request information to a log file or charging an advertising account.

In contrast, the methods POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, and PATCH are not safe. They may modify the state of the server or have other effects such as sending an email. Such methods are therefore not usually used by conforming web robots or web crawlers; some that do not conform tend to make requests without regard to context or consequences.

Despite the prescribed safety of GET requests, in practice their handling by the server is not technically limited in any way. Careless or deliberately irregular programming can allow GET requests to cause non-trivial changes on the server. This is discouraged because of the problems which can occur when web caching, search engines, and other automated agents make unintended changes on the server. For example, a website might allow deletion of a resource through a URL such as &quot;https://example.com/article/1234/delete&quot;, which, if arbitrarily fetched, even using GET, would simply delete the article. A properly coded website would require a DELETE or POST method for this action, which non-malicious bots would not make.

One example of this occurring in practice was during the short-lived Google Web Accelerator beta, which prefetched arbitrary URLs on the page a user was viewing, causing records to be automatically altered or deleted &quot;en masse&quot;. The beta was suspended only weeks after its first release, following widespread criticism.

==== Idempotent methods ====

A request method is &quot;idempotent&quot; if multiple identical requests with that method have the same effect as a single such request. The methods PUT and DELETE, and safe methods are defined as idempotent. Safe methods are trivially idempotent, since they are intended to have no effect on the server whatsoever; the PUT and DELETE methods, meanwhile, are idempotent since successive identical requests will be ignored. A website might, for instance, set up a PUT endpoint to modify a user&#x27;s recorded email address. If this endpoint is configured correctly, any requests which ask to change a user&#x27;s email address to the same email address which is already recorded—e.g. duplicate requests following a successful request—will have no effect. Similarly, a request to DELETE a certain user will have no effect if that user has already been deleted.

In contrast, the methods POST, CONNECT, and PATCH are not necessarily idempotent, and therefore sending an identical POST request multiple times may further modify the state of the server or have further effects, such as sending multiple emails. In some cases this is the desired effect, but in other cases it may occur accidentally. A user might, for example, inadvertently send multiple POST requests by clicking a button again if they were not given clear feedback that the first click was being processed. While web browsers may show alert dialog boxes to warn users in some cases where reloading a page may re-submit a POST request, it is generally up to the web application to handle cases where a POST request should not be submitted more than once.

Note that whether or not a method is idempotent is not enforced by the protocol or web server. It is perfectly possible to write a web application in which (for example) a database insert or other non-idempotent action is triggered by a GET or other request. To do so against recommendations, however, may result in undesirable consequences, if a user agent assumes that repeating the same request is safe when it is not.

==== Cacheable methods ====

A request method is &quot;cacheable&quot; if responses to requests with that method may be stored for future reuse. The methods GET, HEAD, and POST are defined as cacheable.

In contrast, the methods PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE, and PATCH are not cacheable.

=== Request header fields ===

Request header fields allow the client to pass additional information beyond the request line, acting as request modifiers (similarly to the parameters of a procedure). They give information about the client, about the target resource, or about the expected handling of the request.

== HTTP/1.1 response messages ==
A response message is sent by a server to a client as a reply to its former request message.

=== Response syntax ===
A server sends &quot;response messages&quot; to the client, which consist of:
* a status line, consisting of the protocol version, a space, the response status code, another space, a possibly empty reason phrase, a carriage return and a line feed, e.g.:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

* zero or more response header fields, each consisting of the case-insensitive field name, a colon, optional leading whitespace, the field value, an optional trailing whitespace and ending with a carriage return and a line feed, e.g.:
Content-Type: text/html

* an empty line, consisting of a carriage return and a line feed;
* an optional message body.

=== Response status codes ===

In HTTP/1.0 and since, the first line of the HTTP response is called the &quot;status line&quot; and includes a numeric &quot;status code&quot; (such as &quot;404&quot;) and a textual &quot;reason phrase&quot; (such as &quot;Not Found&quot;). The response status code is a three-digit integer code representing the result of the server&#x27;s attempt to understand and satisfy the client&#x27;s corresponding request. The way the client handles the response depends primarily on the status code, and secondarily on the other response header fields. Clients may not understand all registered status codes but they must understand their class (given by the first digit of the status code) and treat an unrecognized status code as being equivalent to the x00 status code of that class.

The standard &quot;reason phrases&quot; are only recommendations, and can be replaced with &quot;local equivalents&quot; at the web developer&#x27;s discretion. If the status code indicated a problem, the user agent might display the &quot;reason phrase&quot; to the user to provide further information about the nature of the problem. The standard also allows the user agent to attempt to interpret the &quot;reason phrase&quot;, though this might be unwise since the standard explicitly specifies that status codes are machine-readable and &quot;reason phrases&quot; are human-readable.

The first digit of the status code defines its class:
; codice_4 (informational): The request was received, continuing process.
; codice_5 (successful): The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
; codice_6 (redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request.
; codice_7 (client error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
; codice_8 (server error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.

=== Response header fields ===

The response header fields allow the server to pass additional information beyond the status line, acting as response modifiers. They give information about the server or about further access to the target resource or related resources.

Each response header field has a defined meaning which can be further refined by the semantics of the request method or response status code.

== HTTP/1.1 example of request / response transaction ==

A client request (consisting in this case of the request line and a few headers that can be reduced to only the codice_9 header) is followed by a blank line, so that the request ends with a double end of line, each in the form of a carriage return followed by a line feed. The codice_9 header value distinguishes between various DNS names sharing a single IP address, allowing name-based virtual hosting. While optional in HTTP/1.0, it is mandatory in HTTP/1.1. (A &quot;/&quot; (slash) will usually fetch a /index.html file if there is one.)

=== Server response ===

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 23 May 2005 22:38:34 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 155
Last-Modified: Wed, 08 Jan 2003 23:11:55 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.3.7 (Unix) (Red-Hat/Linux)
ETag: &quot;3f80f-1b6-3e1cb03b&quot;
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Connection: close

&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;An Example Page&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Hello World, this is a very simple HTML document.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
The ETag (entity tag) header field is used to determine if a cached version of the requested resource is identical to the current version of the resource on the server. codice_11 specifies the Internet media type of the data conveyed by the HTTP message, while codice_12 indicates its length in bytes. The HTTP/1.1 webserver publishes its ability to respond to requests for certain byte ranges of the document by setting the field codice_13. This is useful, if the client needs to have only certain portions of a resource sent by the server, which is called byte serving. When codice_14 is sent, it means that the web server will close the TCP connection immediately after the end of the transfer of this response.

Most of the header lines are optional but some are mandatory. When header codice_1 is missing in a response with an entity body then this should be considered an error in HTTP/1.0 but it may not be an error in HTTP/1.1 if header codice_16 is present. Chunked transfer encoding uses a chunk size of 0 to mark the end of the content. Some old implementations of HTTP/1.0 omitted the header codice_12 when the length of the body entity was not known at the beginning of the response and so the transfer of data to client continued until server closed the socket.

A codice_18 can be used to inform the client that the body entity part of the transmitted data is compressed by gzip algorithm.

== Encrypted connections ==
The most popular way of establishing an encrypted HTTP connection is HTTPS. Two other methods for establishing an encrypted HTTP connection also exist: Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and using the HTTP/1.1 Upgrade header to specify an upgrade to TLS. Browser support for these two is, however, nearly non-existent.

== Similar protocols ==
* The Gopher protocol is a content delivery protocol that was displaced by HTTP in the early 1990s.
* The SPDY protocol is an alternative to HTTP developed at Google, superseded by HTTP/2.
* The Gemini protocol is a Gopher-inspired protocol which mandates privacy-related features.

<text>Heinrich Rudolf Hertz ( ; ; 22 February 1857 – 1 January 1894) was a German physicist, who first conclusively proved the existence of the electromagnetic waves predicted by James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s equations of electromagnetism, laying the foundation for the radio and modern telecommunications.

==Biography==
Heinrich Rudolf Hertz was born in 1857 in Hamburg, then a sovereign state of the German Confederation, into a prosperous and cultured Hanseatic family. His father was Gustav Ferdinand Hertz. His mother was Anna Elisabeth Pfefferkorn.

While studying at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums in Hamburg, Hertz showed an aptitude for sciences as well as languages, learning Arabic. He studied sciences and engineering in the German cities of Dresden, Munich and Berlin, where he studied under Gustav R. Kirchhoff and Hermann von Helmholtz. In 1880, Hertz obtained his PhD from the University of Berlin, and for the next three years remained for post-doctoral study under Helmholtz, serving as his assistant. In 1883, Hertz took a post as a lecturer in theoretical physics at the University of Kiel. In 1885, Hertz became a full professor at the University of Karlsruhe.

In 1886, Hertz married Elisabeth Doll, the daughter of Max Doll, a lecturer in geometry at Karlsruhe. They had two daughters: Johanna, born on 20 October 1887 and Mathilde, born on 14 January 1891, who went on to become a notable biologist. During this time Hertz conducted his landmark research into electromagnetic waves.

Hertz took a position of Professor of Physics and Director of the Physics Institute in Bonn on 3 April 1889, a position he held until his death. During this time he worked on theoretical mechanics with his work published in the book &quot;Die Prinzipien der Mechanik in neuem Zusammenhange dargestellt&quot; (&quot;The Principles of Mechanics Presented in a New Form&quot;), published posthumously in 1894.

==Death==
In 1892, Hertz was diagnosed with an infection (after a bout of severe migraines) and underwent operations to treat the illness. He died due to complications after surgery which had attempted to cure his condition. Some consider his ailment to have been caused by a malignant bone condition. He died at the age of 36 in Bonn, Germany, in 1894, and was buried in the Ohlsdorf Cemetery in Hamburg.

Hertz&#x27;s wife, Elisabeth Hertz (&quot;née&quot; Doll; 1864–1941), did not remarry. He was survived by his daughters, Johanna (1887–1967) and Mathilde (1891–1975). Neither ever married or had children, hence Hertz has no living descendants.

==Scientific work==
===Electromagnetic waves===
In 1864 Scottish mathematical physicist James Clerk Maxwell proposed a comprehensive theory of electromagnetism, now called Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Maxwell&#x27;s theory predicted that coupled electric and magnetic fields could travel through space as an &quot;electromagnetic wave&quot;. Maxwell proposed that light consisted of electromagnetic waves of short wavelength, but no one had been able to prove this, or generate or detect electromagnetic waves of other wavelengths.

During Hertz&#x27;s studies in 1879 Helmholtz suggested that Hertz&#x27;s doctoral dissertation be on testing Maxwell&#x27;s theory. Helmholtz had also proposed the &quot;Berlin Prize&quot; problem that year at the Prussian Academy of Sciences for anyone who could experimentally prove an electromagnetic effect in the polarization and depolarization of insulators, something predicted by Maxwell&#x27;s theory. Helmholtz was sure Hertz was the most likely candidate to win it. Not seeing any way to build an apparatus to experimentally test this, Hertz thought it was too difficult, and worked on electromagnetic induction instead. Hertz did produce an analysis of Maxwell&#x27;s equations during his time at Kiel, showing they did have more validity than the then prevalent &quot;action at a distance&quot; theories.

In the autumn of 1886, after Hertz received his professorship at Karlsruhe, he was experimenting with a pair of Riess spirals when he noticed that discharging a Leyden jar into one of these coils produced a spark in the other coil. With an idea on how to build an apparatus, Hertz now had a way to proceed with the &quot;Berlin Prize&quot; problem of 1879 on proving Maxwell&#x27;s theory (although the actual prize had expired uncollected in 1882). He used a dipole antenna consisting of two collinear one-meter wires with a spark gap between their inner ends, and zinc spheres attached to the outer ends for capacitance, as a radiator. The antenna was excited by pulses of high voltage of about 30 kilovolts applied between the two sides from a Ruhmkorff coil. He received the waves with a resonant single-loop antenna with a micrometer spark gap between the ends. This experiment produced and received what are now called radio waves in the very high frequency range.

Between 1886 and 1889 Hertz conducted a series of experiments that would prove the effects he was observing were results of Maxwell&#x27;s predicted electromagnetic waves. Starting in November 1887 with his paper &quot;On Electromagnetic Effects Produced by Electrical Disturbances in Insulators&quot;, Hertz sent a series of papers to Helmholtz at the Berlin Academy, including papers in 1888 that showed transverse free space electromagnetic waves traveling at a finite speed over a distance. In the apparatus Hertz used, the electric and magnetic fields radiated away from the wires as transverse waves. Hertz had positioned the oscillator about 12 meters from a zinc reflecting plate to produce standing waves. Each wave was about 4 meters long. Using the ring detector, he recorded how the wave&#x27;s magnitude and component direction varied. Hertz measured Maxwell&#x27;s waves and demonstrated that the velocity of these waves was equal to the velocity of light. The electric field intensity, polarization and reflection of the waves were also measured by Hertz. These experiments established that light and these waves were both a form of electromagnetic radiation obeying the Maxwell equations.


Hertz did not realize the practical importance of his radio wave experiments. He stated that,

It&#x27;s of no use whatsoever ... this is just an experiment that proves Maestro Maxwell was right—we just have these mysterious electromagnetic waves that we cannot see with the naked eye. But they are there.

Asked about the applications of his discoveries, Hertz replied,

Nothing, I guess

Hertz&#x27;s proof of the existence of airborne electromagnetic waves led to an explosion of experimentation with this new form of electromagnetic radiation, which was called &quot;Hertzian waves&quot; until around 1910 when the term &quot;radio waves&quot; became current. Within 6 years Guglielmo Marconi began developing a radio wave based wireless telegraphy system, leading to the wide use of radio communication.

=== Cathode rays ===
In 1883, he tried to prove that the cathode rays are electrically neutral and got what he interpreted as a confident absence of deflection in electrostatic field. However, as J. J. Thomson explained in 1897, Hertz placed the deflecting electrodes in a highly-conductive area of the tube, resulting in a strong screening effect close to their surface.

Nine years later Hertz began experimenting and demonstrated that cathode rays could penetrate very thin metal foil (such as aluminium). Philipp Lenard, a student of Heinrich Hertz, further researched this &quot;ray effect&quot;. He developed a version of the cathode tube and studied the penetration by X-rays of various materials. However, Lenard did not realize that he was producing X-rays. Hermann von Helmholtz formulated mathematical equations for X-rays. He postulated a dispersion theory before Röntgen made his discovery and announcement. It was formed on the basis of the electromagnetic theory of light (&quot;Wiedmann&#x27;s Annalen&quot;, Vol. XLVIII). However, he did not work with actual X-rays.

=== Photoelectric effect ===
Hertz helped establish the photoelectric effect (which was later explained by Albert Einstein) when he noticed that a charged object loses its charge more readily when illuminated by ultraviolet radiation (UV). In 1887, he made observations of the photoelectric effect and of the production and reception of electromagnetic (EM) waves, published in the journal &quot;Annalen der Physik&quot;. His receiver consisted of a coil with a spark gap, whereby a spark would be seen upon detection of EM waves. He placed the apparatus in a darkened box to see the spark better. He observed that the maximum spark length was reduced when in the box. A glass panel placed between the source of EM waves and the receiver absorbed UV that assisted the electrons in jumping across the gap. When removed, the spark length would increase. He observed no decrease in spark length when he substituted quartz for glass, as quartz does not absorb UV radiation. Hertz concluded his months of investigation and reported the results obtained. He did not further pursue investigation of this effect, nor did he make any attempt at explaining how the observed phenomenon was brought about.

===Contact mechanics===

In 1881 and 1882, Hertz published two articles on what was to become known as the field of contact mechanics, which proved to be an important basis for later theories in the field. Joseph Valentin Boussinesq published some critically important observations on Hertz&#x27;s work, nevertheless establishing this work on contact mechanics to be of immense importance. His work basically summarises how two axi-symmetric objects placed in contact will behave under loading, he obtained results based upon the classical theory of elasticity and continuum mechanics. The most significant flaw of his theory was the neglect of any nature of adhesion between the two solids, which proves to be important as the materials composing the solids start to assume high elasticity. It was natural to neglect adhesion at the time, however, as there were no experimental methods of testing for it.

To develop his theory Hertz used his observation of elliptical Newton&#x27;s rings formed upon placing a glass sphere upon a lens as the basis of assuming that the pressure exerted by the sphere follows an elliptical distribution. He used the formation of Newton&#x27;s rings again while validating his theory with experiments in calculating the displacement which the sphere has into the lens. Kenneth L. Johnson, K. Kendall and A. D. Roberts (JKR) used this theory as a basis while calculating the theoretical displacement or &quot;indentation depth&quot; in the presence of adhesion in 1971. Hertz&#x27;s theory is recovered from their formulation if the adhesion of the materials is assumed to be zero. Similar to this theory, however using different assumptions, B. V. Derjaguin, V. M. Muller and Y. P. Toporov published another theory in 1975, which came to be known as the DMT theory in the research community, which also recovered Hertz&#x27;s formulations under the assumption of zero adhesion. This DMT theory proved to be premature and needed several revisions before it came to be accepted as another material contact theory in addition to the JKR theory. Both the DMT and the JKR theories form the basis of contact mechanics upon which all transition contact models are based and used in material parameter prediction in nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy. These models are central to the field of tribology and he was named as one of the 23 &quot;Men of Tribology&quot; by Duncan Dowson. Despite preceding his great work on electromagnetism (which he himself considered with his characteristic soberness to be trivial), Hertz&#x27;s research on contact mechanics has facilitated the age of nanotechnology.

Hertz also described the &quot;Hertzian cone&quot;, a type of fracture mode in brittle solids caused by the transmission of stress waves.

===Meteorology===
Hertz always had a deep interest in meteorology, probably derived from his contacts with Wilhelm von Bezold (who was his professor in a laboratory course at the Munich Polytechnic in the summer of 1878). As an assistant to Helmholtz in Berlin, he contributed a few minor articles in the field, including research on the evaporation of liquids, a new kind of hygrometer, and a graphical means of determining the properties of moist air when subjected to adiabatic changes.

=== Philosophy of science ===
In the introduction of his 1894 book &quot;Principles of Mechanics&quot;, Hertz discusses the different &quot;pictures&quot; used to represent physics in his time including the picture of Newtonian mechanics (based on mass and forces), a second picture (based on conservation of energy and Hamilton&#x27;s principle) and his own picture (based uniquely on space, time, mass and the Hertz principle), comparing them in terms of &#x27;permissibility&#x27;, &#x27;correctness&#x27; and &#x27;appropriateness&#x27;. Hertz wanted to remove &quot;empty assumptions&quot; and argue against the Newtonian concept of force and against action at a distance. Philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein inspired by Hertz&#x27;s work, extended his picture theory into a picture theory of language in his 1921 &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot; which influenced logical positivism&quot;.&quot; Wittgenstein also quotes him in the &quot;Blue and Brown Books&quot;.

==Third Reich treatment==
Because Hertz&#x27;s family converted from Judaism to Lutheranism two decades before his birth, his legacy ran afoul of the Nazi government in the 1930s, a regime that classified people by &quot;race&quot; instead of religious affiliation.

Hertz&#x27;s name was removed from streets and institutions and there was even a movement to rename the frequency unit named in his honor (hertz) after Hermann von Helmholtz instead, keeping the symbol (Hz) unchanged.

His family was also persecuted for their non-Aryan status. Hertz&#x27;s youngest daughter, Mathilde, lost a lectureship at Berlin University after the Nazis came to power and within a few years she, her sister, and their mother left Germany and settled in England.

==Legacy and honors==
Heinrich Hertz&#x27;s nephew, Gustav Ludwig Hertz was a Nobel Prize winner, and Gustav&#x27;s son Carl Helmut Hertz invented medical ultrasonography. His daughter Mathilde Carmen Hertz was a well-known biologist and comparative psychologist. Hertz&#x27;s grandnephew Hermann Gerhard Hertz, professor at the University of Karlsruhe, was a pioneer of NMR-spectroscopy and in 1995 published Hertz&#x27;s laboratory notes.

The SI unit &quot;hertz&quot; (Hz) was established in his honor by the International Electrotechnical Commission in 1930 for frequency, an expression of the number of times that a repeated event occurs per second. It was adopted by the CGPM (Conférence générale des poids et mesures) in 1960, officially replacing the previous name, &quot;cycles per second&quot; (cps).

In 1928 the Heinrich-Hertz Institute for Oscillation Research was founded in Berlin. Today known as the &quot;Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich Hertz Institute, HHI&quot;.

In 1969, in East Germany, a Heinrich Hertz memorial medal was cast.

The IEEE Heinrich Hertz Medal, established in 1987, is &quot;&quot;for outstanding achievements in Hertzian waves &quot;[...]&quot; presented annually to an individual for achievements which are theoretical or experimental in nature&quot;&quot;.

The Submillimeter Radio Telescope at Mt. Graham, Arizona, constructed in 1992 is named after him.

A crater that lies on the far side of the Moon, just behind the eastern limb, is the Hertz crater, named in his honor.

On his birthday in 2012, Google honored Hertz with a Google doodle, inspired by his life&#x27;s work, on its home page.

<text>The Hebrew alphabet (, ), known variously by scholars as the [[Ktav Ashuri]], Jewish script, square script and block script, is a unicameral abjad script used in the writing of the Hebrew language and other Jewish languages, most notably Yiddish, Ladino, Judeo-Arabic, and Judeo-Persian. In modern Hebrew, vowels are increasingly introduced. It is also used informally in Israel to write Levantine Arabic, especially among Druze. It is an offshoot of the Imperial Aramaic alphabet, which flourished during the Achaemenid Empire and which itself derives from the Phoenician alphabet.

Historically, a different abjad script was used to write Hebrew: the original, old Hebrew script, now known as the paleo-Hebrew alphabet, has been largely preserved in a variant form as the Samaritan alphabet, and is still used by the Samaritans. The present &quot;Jewish script&quot; or &quot;square script&quot;, on the contrary, is a stylized form of the Aramaic alphabet and was technically known by Jewish sages as Ashurit (lit. &quot;Assyrian script&quot;), since its origins were known to be from Assyria (Mesopotamia).

Various &quot;styles&quot; (in current terms, &quot;fonts&quot;) of representation of the Jewish script letters described in this article also exist, including a variety of cursive Hebrew styles. In the remainder of this article, the term &quot;Hebrew alphabet&quot; refers to the square script unless otherwise indicated.

The Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters. It does not have case. Five letters have different forms when used at the end of a word. Hebrew is written from right to left. Originally, the alphabet was an abjad consisting only of consonants, but is now considered an impure abjad. As with other abjads, such as the Arabic alphabet, during its centuries-long use scribes devised means of indicating vowel sounds by separate vowel points, known in Hebrew as &quot;niqqud.&quot; In both biblical and rabbinic Hebrew, the letters can also function as &quot;matres lectionis&quot;, which is when certain consonants are used to indicate vowels. There is a trend in Modern Hebrew towards the use of &quot;matres lectionis&quot; to indicate vowels that have traditionally gone unwritten, a practice known as &quot;full spelling&quot;.

The Yiddish alphabet, a modified version of the Hebrew alphabet used to write Yiddish, is a true alphabet, with all vowels rendered in the spelling, except in the case of inherited Hebrew words, which typically retain their Hebrew consonant-only spellings.

The Arabic and Hebrew alphabets have similarities because they are both derived from the Aramaic alphabet, which in turn derives either from paleo-Hebrew or the Phoenician alphabet, both being slight regional variations of the Proto-Canaanite alphabet used in ancient times to write the various Canaanite languages (including Hebrew, Moabite, Phoenician, Punic, et cetera).

==History==

The Canaanite dialects were largely indistinguishable before around 1000 BCE. An example of related early Semitic inscriptions from the area include the tenth-century Gezer calendar over which scholars are divided as to whether its language is Hebrew or Phoenician and whether the script is Proto-Canaanite or paleo-Hebrew.

A Hebrew variant of the Proto-Canaanite alphabet, called the paleo-Hebrew alphabet by scholars, began to emerge around 800 BCE. An example is the Siloam inscription ().

The paleo-Hebrew alphabet was used in the ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Following the Babylonian exile of the Kingdom of Judah in the 6th century BCE, Jews began using a form of the Imperial Aramaic alphabet, another offshoot of the same family of scripts, which flourished during the Achaemenid Empire. The Samaritans, who remained in the Land of Israel, continued to use the paleo-Hebrew alphabet. During the 3rd century BCE, Jews began to use a stylized, &quot;square&quot; form of the Aramaic alphabet that was used by the Persian Empire (and which in turn had been adopted from the Assyrians), while the Samaritans continued to use a form of the paleo-Hebrew script called the Samaritan alphabet. After the fall of the Persian Empire in 330 BCE, Jews used both scripts before settling on the square Assyrian form.

The square Hebrew alphabet was later adapted and used for writing languages of the Jewish diasporasuch as Karaim, the Judeo-Arabic languages, Judaeo-Spanish, and Yiddish. The Hebrew alphabet continued in use for scholarly writing in Hebrew and came again into everyday use with the rebirth of the Hebrew language as a spoken language in the 18th and 19th centuries, especially in Israel.

==Description==
===General===
In the traditional form, the Hebrew alphabet is an abjad consisting only of consonants, written from right to left. It has 22 letters, five of which use different forms at the end of a word.

===Vowels===
In the traditional form, vowels are indicated by the weak consonants Aleph (), He (), Waw/Vav (), or Yodh () serving as vowel letters, or &quot;matres lectionis&quot;: the letter is combined with a previous vowel and becomes silent, or by imitation of such cases in the spelling of other forms. Also, a system of vowel points to indicate vowels (diacritics), called niqqud, was developed. In modern forms of the alphabet, as in the case of Yiddish and to some extent Modern Hebrew, vowels may be indicated. Today, the trend is toward full spelling with the weak letters acting as true vowels.

When used to write Yiddish, vowels are indicated, using certain letters, either with niqqud diacritics (e.g. or ) or without (e.g. or ), except for Hebrew words, which in Yiddish are written in their Hebrew spelling.

To preserve the proper vowel sounds, scholars developed several different sets of vocalization and diacritical symbols called &quot;nequdot&quot; (, literally &quot;points&quot;). One of these, the Tiberian system, eventually prevailed. Aaron ben Moses ben Asher, and his family for several generations, are credited for refining and maintaining the system. These points are normally used only for special purposes, such as Biblical books intended for study, in poetry or when teaching the language to children. The Tiberian system also includes a set of cantillation marks, called &quot;trope&quot; or , used to indicate how scriptural passages should be chanted in synagogue recitations of scripture (although these marks do not appear in the scrolls). In everyday writing of modern Hebrew, &quot;niqqud&quot; are absent; however, patterns of how words are derived from Hebrew roots (called &quot;shorashim&quot; or &quot;triliterals&quot;) allow Hebrew speakers to determine the vowel-structure of a given word from its consonants based on the word&#x27;s context and part of speech.

===Alphabet===
Unlike the Paleo-Hebrew writing script, the modern Hebrew script has five letters that have special final forms, called sofit (, meaning in this context &quot;final&quot; or &quot;ending&quot;) form, used only at the end of a word, somewhat as in the Greek or in the Arabic and Mandaic alphabets. These are shown below the normal form in the following table (letter names are Unicode standard). Although Hebrew is read and written from right to left, the following table shows the letters in order from left to right:

===Order===
As far back as the 13th century BCE, ancient Hebrew abecedaries indicate a slightly different ordering of the alphabet. The Zayit Stone, Izbet Sartah ostracon, and one inscription from Kuntillet Ajrud each contain a number of reverse letter orders; such as -, -, -, etc.

A reversal to can be clearly seen in the Book of Lamentations, whose first four chapters are ordered as alphabetical acrostics. In the Masoretic text, the first chapter has the now-usual ordering, and the second, third and fourth chapters exhibit . In the Dead Sea Scrolls version (4QLam/4Q111), reversed ordering also appears in the first chapter (i.e. in all the first four chapters). The fact that these chapters follows the pre-exilic order is evidence for them being written shortly after the events described, rather than being later, post-exilic compositions.

==Pronunciation==

===Alphabet===

The descriptions that follow are based on the pronunciation of modern standard Israeli Hebrew.
By analogy with the other dotted/dotless pairs, dotless tav, , would be expected to be pronounced /θ/ (voiceless dental fricative), and dotless dalet as /ð/ (voiced dental fricative), but these were lost among most Jews due to these sounds not existing in the countries where they lived (such as in nearly all of Eastern Europe). Yiddish modified /θ/ to /s/ (cf. seseo in Spanish), but in modern Israeli Hebrew, it is simply pronounced /t/. Likewise, historical /ð/ is simply pronounced /d/.

====Shin and sin====

&quot;Shin&quot; and &quot;sin&quot; are represented by the same letter, , but are two separate phonemes. When vowel diacritics are used, the two phonemes are differentiated with a &quot;shin&quot;-dot or &quot;sin&quot;-dot; the &quot;shin&quot;-dot is above the upper-right side of the letter, and the &quot;sin&quot;-dot is above the upper-left side of the letter.

Historically, &quot;left-dot-sin&quot; corresponds to Proto-Semitic *, which in biblical-Judaic-Hebrew corresponded to the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative (or /ś/).

====Dagesh====

Historically, the consonants &quot;bet&quot;, &quot;gimmel&quot;, &quot;daleth&quot;, &quot;kaf&quot;, &quot;pe&quot; and &quot;tav&quot; each had two sounds: one hard (plosive), and one soft (fricative), depending on the position of the letter and other factors. When vowel diacritics are used, the hard sounds are indicated by a central dot called &quot;dagesh&quot; (), while the soft sounds lack a &quot;dagesh&quot;. In modern Hebrew, however, the &quot;dagesh&quot; only changes the pronunciation of &quot;bet&quot;, &quot;kaf&quot;, and &quot;pe&quot;, and does not affect the name of the letter. The differences are as follows:

In other dialects (mainly liturgical) there are variations from this pattern.
*In some Sephardi and Mizrahi dialects, &quot;bet&quot; without dagesh is pronounced , like &quot;bet&quot; with dagesh
*In Syrian and Yemenite Hebrew, &quot;gimel&quot; without dagesh is pronounced .
*In Yemenite Hebrew, and in the Iraqi pronunciation of the word &quot;Adonai&quot;, &quot;dalet&quot; without dagesh is pronounced as in &quot;these&quot;
*In Ashkenazi Hebrew, as well as Krymchaki Hebrew, &quot;tav&quot; without dagesh is pronounced as in &quot;silk&quot;
*In Iraqi and Yemenite Hebrew, and formerly in some other dialects, &quot;tav&quot; without dagesh is pronounced as in &quot;thick&quot;

====Sounds represented with diacritic geresh====

The sounds , , , written ⟨⟩, ⟨⟩, ⟨⟩, and , non-standardly sometimes transliterated ⟨⟩, are often found in slang and loanwords that are part of the everyday Hebrew colloquial vocabulary. The symbol resembling an apostrophe after the Hebrew letter modifies the pronunciation of the letter and is called a &quot;geresh&quot;.

The pronunciation of the following letters can also be modified with the geresh diacritic. The represented sounds are however foreign to Hebrew phonology, i.e., these symbols mainly represent sounds in foreign words or names when transliterated with the Hebrew alphabet, and not loanwords.

&quot;Geresh&quot; is also used to denote an abbreviation consisting of a single Hebrew letter, while &quot;gershayim&quot; (a doubled &quot;geresh&quot;) are used to denote acronyms pronounced as a string of letters; &quot;geresh&quot; and &quot;gershayim&quot; are also used to denote Hebrew numerals consisting of a single Hebrew letter or of multiple Hebrew letters, respectively. Geresh is also the name of a cantillation mark used for Torah recitation, though its visual appearance and function are different in that context.

====Identical pronunciation====
In much of Israel&#x27;s general population, especially where Ashkenazic pronunciation is prevalent, many letters have the same pronunciation. They are as follows:


====Ancient Hebrew pronunciation====

Some of the variations in sound mentioned above are due to a systematic feature of Ancient Hebrew. The six consonants were pronounced differently depending on their position. These letters were also called &quot;BeGeD KeFeT&quot; letters . The full details are very complex; this summary omits some points. They were pronounced as plosives at the beginning of a syllable, or when doubled. They were pronounced as fricatives when preceded by a vowel (commonly indicated with a macron, ḇ ḡ ḏ ḵ p̄ ṯ). The plosive and double pronunciations were indicated by the &quot;dagesh&quot;. In Modern Hebrew the sounds ḏ and ḡ have reverted to and , respectively, and ṯ has become , so only the remaining three consonants show variation. &quot;resh&quot; may have also been a &quot;doubled&quot; letter, making the list &quot;BeGeD KePoReT&quot;. (Sefer Yetzirah, 4:1)

* &quot;chet&quot; and &quot;ayin&quot; represented the pharyngeal fricatives and , respectively, &quot;tsadi&quot; represented the emphatic consonant , &quot;tet&quot; represented the emphatic consonant , and &quot;qof&quot; represented the uvular plosive . All these are common Semitic consonants.
* &quot;sin&quot; (the variant of &quot;shin&quot;) was originally different from both &quot;shin&quot; and &quot;samekh&quot;, but had become the same as &quot;samekh&quot; by the time the vowel pointing was devised. Because of cognates with other Semitic languages, this phoneme is known to have originally been a lateral consonant, most likely the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative (the sound of modern Welsh &quot;ll&quot;) or the voiceless alveolar lateral affricate (like Náhuatl &quot;tl&quot;).

====Regional and historical variation====

The following table contains the pronunciation of the Hebrew letters in reconstructed historical forms and dialects using the . The apostrophe-looking symbol after some letters is not a yud but a geresh. It is used for loanwords with non-native Hebrew sounds. The dot in the middle of some of the letters, called a &quot;dagesh kal&quot;, also modifies the sounds of the letters , and in modern Hebrew (in some forms of Hebrew it modifies also the sounds of the letters , and/or ; the &quot;dagesh chazak&quot;orthographically indistinguishable from the &quot;dagesh kal&quot;designates gemination, which today is realized only rarelye.g. in biblical recitations or when using Arabic loanwords).

# velarized or pharyngealized
# pharyngealized
# sometimes said to be ejective but more likely glottalized.

===Vowels===

====Matres lectionis====
 &quot;alef&quot;, &quot;ayin&quot;, &quot;waw/vav&quot; and &quot;yod&quot; are letters that can sometimes indicate a vowel instead of a consonant (which would be, respectively, ). When they do, and are considered to constitute part of the vowel designation in combination with a niqqud symbola vowel diacritic (whether or not the diacritic is marked), whereas and are considered to be mute, their role being purely indicative of the non-marked vowel.

====Vowel points====

&quot;Niqqud&quot; is the system of dots that help determine vowels and consonants. In Hebrew, all forms of &quot;niqqud&quot; are often omitted in writing, except for children&#x27;s books, prayer books, poetry, foreign words, and words which would be ambiguous to pronounce. Israeli Hebrew has five vowel phonemes, , but many more written symbols for them:


=====Meteg=====
By adding a vertical line (called &quot;Meteg&quot;) underneath the letter and to the left of the vowel point, the vowel is made long. The &quot;meteg&quot; is only used in Biblical Hebrew, not Modern Hebrew.

=====Sh&#x27;va=====
By adding two vertical dots (called &quot;sh&#x27;va&quot;) underneath the letter, the vowel is made very short. When sh&#x27;va is placed on the first letter of the word, mostly it is &quot;è&quot; (but in some instances, it makes the first letter silent without a vowel (vowel-less): e.g. וְ &quot;wè&quot; to &quot;w&quot;).

=====Comparison table=====
===Gershayim===

The symbol is called a &quot;gershayim&quot; and is a punctuation mark used in the Hebrew language to denote acronyms. It is written before the last letter in the acronym, e.g. . &quot;Gershayim&quot; is also the name of a cantillation mark in the reading of the Torah, printed above the accented letter, e.g. .

==Stylistic variants==
The following table displays typographic and chirographic variants of each letter. For the letters that have different forms in word-final position, the final forms are displayed beneath the regular forms.

The block (&quot;square&quot;, or &quot;print&quot; form) and cursive (&quot;handwritten&quot; form) are the only variants in widespread contemporary use. Rashi is also used, for historical reasons, in a handful of standard texts.

==Numeric values of letters==
Following the adoption of Greek Hellenistic alphabetic numeration practice, Hebrew letters started being used to denote numbers in the late 2nd century BCE, and performed this arithmetic function for about a thousand years. Nowadays alphanumeric notation is used only in specific contexts, e.g. denoting dates in the Hebrew calendar, denoting grades of school in Israel, other listings (e.g. , &quot;phase a, phase b&quot;), commonly in Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) in a practice known as &quot;gematria&quot;, and often in religious contexts.


The numbers 500, 600, 700, 800 and 900 are commonly represented by the juxtapositions , , , , and respectively.
Adding a geresh ⟨⟩ to a letter multiplies its value by one thousand, for example, the year 5778 is portrayed as , where represents 5000, and represents 778.

==Transliterations and transcriptions==
The following table lists transliterations and transcriptions of Hebrew letters used in Modern Hebrew.

Clarifications:
*For some letters, the Academy of the Hebrew Language offers a &quot;precise&quot; transliteration that differs from the &quot;regular&quot; standard it has set. When omitted, no such precise alternative exists and the regular standard applies.
*The IPA phonemic transcription is specified whenever it uses a different symbol from the one used for the regular standard Israeli transliteration.
*The IPA phonetic transcription is specified whenever it differs from IPA phonemic transcription.

Note: SBL&#x27;s transliteration system, recommended in its &quot;Handbook of Style&quot;, differs slightly from the 2006 &quot;precise&quot; transliteration system of the Academy of the Hebrew Language; for ⟨⟩ SBL uses ⟨ṣ⟩ (≠ AHL ⟨ẓ⟩), and for with no dagesh, SBL uses the same symbols as for with dagesh (i.e. ⟨b⟩, ⟨g⟩, ⟨d⟩, ⟨k⟩, ⟨f⟩, ⟨t⟩).


;Notes:
A1234In transliterations of modern Israeli Hebrew, initial and final (in regular transliteration), silent or initial , and silent are &quot;not&quot; transliterated. To the eye of readers orientating themselves on Latin (or similar) alphabets, these letters might seem to be transliterated as vowel letters; however, these are in fact transliterations of the vowel diacriticsniqqud (or are representations of the spoken vowels). E.g., in (&quot;if&quot;, ), (&quot;mother&quot;, ) and (&quot;nut&quot;, ), the letter always represents the same consonant: (glottal stop), whereas the vowels /i/, /e/ and /o/ respectively represent the spoken vowel, whether it is orthographically denoted by diacritics or not. Since the Academy of the Hebrew Language ascertains that in initial position is not transliterated, the symbol for the glottal stop  ʾ  is omitted from the transliteration, and only the subsequent vowels are transliterated (whether or not their corresponding vowel diacritics appeared in the text being transliterated), resulting in &quot;im&quot;, &quot;em&quot; and &quot;om&quot;, respectively.

B123The diacritic geresh ⟨⟩ is used with some other letters as well (, , , , , ), but only to transliterate &quot;from&quot; other languages &quot;to&quot; Hebrewnever to spell Hebrew words; therefore they were not included in this table (correctly translating a Hebrew text with these letters would require using the spelling in the language from which the transliteration to Hebrew was originally made). The non-standard ⟨⟩ and ⟨⟩ are sometimes used to represent , which like , and appears in Hebrew slang and loanwords.

C12The sound (as ⟨ch⟩ in loch) is often transcribed ⟨ch⟩, inconsistently with the guidelines specified by the Academy of the Hebrew Language: → &quot;cham&quot;; → &quot;schach&quot;.

DAlthough the Bible does include a single occurrence of a final pe with a dagesh (Book of Proverbs 30, 6: ), in modern Hebrew is always represented by pe in its regular, not final, form , even when in word-final position, which occurs with loanwords (e.g. &quot;shop&quot;), foreign names (e.g. &quot;Philip&quot;) and some slang (e.g. &quot;slept deeply&quot;).

==Religious use==
The letters of the Hebrew alphabet have played varied roles in Jewish religious literature over the centuries, primarily in mystical texts. Some sources in classical rabbinical literature seem to acknowledge the historical provenance of the currently used Hebrew alphabet and deal with them as a mundane subject (the Jerusalem Talmud, for example, records that &quot;the Israelites took for themselves square calligraphy&quot;, and that the letters &quot;came with the Israelites from Ashur [Assyria]&quot;); others attribute mystical significance to the letters, connecting them with the process of creation or the redemption. In mystical conceptions, the alphabet is considered eternal, pre-existent to the Earth, and the letters themselves are seen as having holiness and power, sometimes to such an extent that several stories from the Talmud illustrate the idea that they cannot be destroyed.

The idea of the letters&#x27; creative power finds its greatest vehicle in the Sefer Yezirah, or &quot;Book of Creation&quot;, a mystical text of uncertain origin which describes a story of creation highly divergent from that in the Book of Genesis, largely through exposition on the powers of the letters of the alphabet. The supposed creative powers of the letters are also referenced in the Talmud and Zohar.
Another book, the 13th-century Kabbalistic text Sefer HaTemunah, holds that a single letter of unknown pronunciation, held by some to be the four-pronged shin on one side of the teffilin box, is missing from the current alphabet. The world&#x27;s flaws, the book teaches, are related to the absence of this letter, the eventual revelation of which will repair the universe. Another example of messianic significance attached to the letters is the teaching of Rabbi Eliezer that the five letters of the alphabet with distinct final forms hold the &quot;secret of redemption&quot;.

In addition, the letters occasionally feature in aggadic portions of non-mystical rabbinic literature. In such aggada the letters are often given anthropomorphic qualities and depicted as speaking to God. Commonly their shapes are used in parables to illustrate points of ethics or theology. An example from the Babylonian Talmud (a parable intended to discourage speculation about the universe before creation):

Extensive instructions about the proper methods of forming the letters are found in Mishnat Soferim, within Mishna Berura of Yisrael Meir Kagan.

==Mathematical use==
In set theory, formula_1, pronounced aleph-naught, aleph-zero, or aleph-null, is used to mark the cardinal number of an infinite countable set, such as formula_2, the set of all integers. More generally, the formula_3 aleph number notation marks the ordered sequence of all distinct infinite cardinal numbers.

Less frequently used, the formula_4 beth number notation is used for the iterated power sets of formula_1. The second element formula_6 is the cardinality of the continuum. Very occasionally, a gimel function is used in cardinal notation.

==Unicode and HTML==
The Unicode Hebrew block extends from U+0590 to U+05FF and from U+FB1D to U+FB4F. It includes letters, ligatures, combining diacritical marks (&quot;Niqqud&quot; and cantillation marks) and punctuation. The Numeric Character References is included for HTML. These can be used in many markup languages, and they are often used in Wiki to create the Hebrew glyphs compatible with the majority of web browsers.

Standard Hebrew keyboards have a 101-key layout. Like the standard QWERTY layout, the Hebrew layout was derived from the order of letters on Hebrew typewriters.

==Notes==
a&quot;Alef-bet&quot; is commonly written in Israeli Hebrew without the &quot;&quot; (, &quot;[Hebrew] hyphen&quot;), , as opposed to with the hyphen, .

bThe Arabic letters generally have four forms each, though six of the primary letters can have only two variants, according to their places in words (initial, medial, final, and isolate). The same applies the Mandaic letters, except for three of the 22 letters, which each have only one form.

cIn forms of Hebrew older than Modern Hebrew, , , and can only be read &quot;b&quot;, &quot;k&quot; and &quot;p&quot;, respectively, at the beginning of a word, while they will have the sole value of &quot;v&quot;, &quot;kh&quot; and &quot;f&quot; in a &quot;sofit&quot; (final) position, with few exceptions. In medial positions, both pronunciations are possible. In Modern Hebrew this restriction is not absolute, e.g. and never (= &quot;physicist&quot;), and never (= &quot;snob&quot;). A &quot;dagesh&quot; may be inserted to unambiguously denote the plosive variant: = , = , =; similarly (though today very rare in Hebrew and common only in Yiddish) a rafé placed above the letter unambiguously denotes the fricative variant: = , = and = . In Modern Hebrew orthography, the sound at the end of a word is denoted by the regular form , as opposed to the final form , which always denotes (see table of transliterations and transcriptions, comment).

dHowever, (two separate vavs), used in Ktiv male, is to be distinguished from the &quot;Yiddish ligature&quot; (also two vavs but together as one character).

e1e2e3e4e5The Academy of the Hebrew Language states that both and be indistinguishably represented in Hebrew using the letter vav. Sometimes the vav is indeed doubled, however not to denote as opposed to but rather, when spelling without niqqud, to denote the phoneme /v/ at a non-initial and non-final position in the word, whereas a single vav at a non-initial and non-final position in the word in spelling without niqqud denotes one of the phonemes /u/ or /o/. To pronounce foreign words and loanwords containing the sound , Hebrew readers must therefore rely on former knowledge and context.

<text>Horatio Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford (; 24 September 1717 – 2 March 1797), better known as Horace Walpole, was an English Whig politician, writer, historian and antiquarian.

He had Strawberry Hill House built in Twickenham, southwest London, reviving the Gothic style some decades before his Victorian successors. His literary reputation rests on the first Gothic novel, &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; (1764), and his &quot;Letters&quot;, which are of significant social and political interest. They have been published by Yale University Press in 48 volumes. In 2017, a volume of Walpole&#x27;s selected letters was published.

The youngest son of the first British Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford, he became the 4th and last Earl of Orford of the second creation on his nephew&#x27;s death in 1791.

==Early life: 1717–1739==
Walpole was born in London, the youngest son of British Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole and his wife, Catherine. Like his father, he received early education in Bexley; in part under Edward Weston. He was also educated at Eton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

Walpole&#x27;s first friends were probably his cousins Francis and Henry Conway, to whom he became strongly attached, especially Henry. At Eton he formed a schoolboy confederacy, the &quot;Triumvirate&quot;, with Charles Lyttelton (later an antiquary and bishop) and George Montagu (later a member of parliament and Private Secretary to Lord North). More important were another group of friends dubbed the &quot;Quadruple Alliance&quot;: Walpole, Thomas Gray, Richard West, and Thomas Ashton.

At Cambridge, Walpole came under the influence of Conyers Middleton, an unorthodox theologian. Walpole came to accept the sceptical nature of Middleton&#x27;s attitude to some essential Christian doctrines for the rest of his life, including a hatred of superstition and bigotry even though he was a nominal Anglican. Ceasing to reside at Cambridge at the end of 1738, Walpole left without taking a degree.

In 1737, Walpole&#x27;s mother died. According to one biographer, his love for his mother &quot;was the most powerful emotion of his entire life ... the whole of his psychological history was dominated by it&quot;. Walpole did not have any serious relationships with women; he has been called &quot;a natural celibate&quot;.

His sexual orientation has been the subject of speculation. He never married, engaging in a succession of unconsummated flirtations with unmarriageable women, and counted among his close friends a number of women such as Anne Seymour Damer and Mary Berry named by a number of sources as lesbian.

Many contemporaries described him as effeminate (one political opponent called him &quot;a hermaphrodite horse&quot;). Biographers, such as W. S. Lewis, Brian Fothergill, and Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer, interpreted Walpole as asexual.

Walpole&#x27;s father secured for him three sinecures which afforded him an income: in 1737 he was appointed Inspector of the Imports and Exports in the Custom House, which he resigned to become Usher of the Exchequer, which gave him at first £3900 per annum but this increased over the years. Upon coming of age he became Comptroller of the Pipe and Clerk of the Estreats which gave him an income of £300 per annum. Walpole decided to go travelling with Thomas Gray and wrote a will in which he left Gray all his belongings.

In 1744, he wrote in a letter to Conway that these offices gave him nearly £2,000 per annum; after 1745 when he was appointed Collectorship of Customs, his total income from these offices was around £3,400 per annum.

==Grand Tour: 1739–1741==

Walpole went on the Grand Tour with Gray, but as Walpole recalled in later life: &quot;We had not got to Calais before Gray was dissatisfied, for I was a boy, and he, though infinitely more a man, was not enough to make allowances&quot;.

They left Dover on 29 March and arrived at Calais later that day. They then travelled through Boulogne, Amiens and Saint-Denis, arriving at Paris on 4 April. Here they met many aristocratic Englishmen. In early June they left Paris for Reims, then in September going to Dijon, Lyon, Dauphiné, Savoy, Aix-les-Bains, Geneva, and then back to Lyons.

In October they left for Italy, arriving in Turin in November, then going to Genoa, Piacenza, Parma, Reggio, Modena, Bologna, and in December arriving at Florence. Here he struck up a friendship with Horace Mann, an assistant to the British Minister at the Court of Tuscany. In Florence he also wrote &quot;Epistle from Florence to Thomas Ashton, Esq., Tutor to the Earl of Plymouth&quot;, a mixture of Whig history and Middleton&#x27;s teachings. In February 1740, Walpole and Gray left for Rome with the intention of witnessing the papal conclave upon the death of Pope Clement XII but never saw it. Walpole wanted to attend fashionable parties and Gray wanted to visit antiquities. At social occasions in Rome, he saw the Old Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart, and his two sons, Charles Edward Stuart and Henry Stuart, although there is no record of them conversing.

Walpole and Gray returned to Florence in July. However, Gray disliked the idleness of Florence as compared to the educational pursuits in Rome, and animosity grew between them, eventually leading to an end to their friendship. On their way back to England they had a furious argument, although it is unknown what it was about. Gray went to Venice, leaving Walpole at Reggio. In later life Walpole admitted that the fault lay primarily with himself:
Walpole then visited Venice, Genoa, Antibes, Toulon, Marseille, Aix, Montpellier, Toulouse, Orléans and Paris. He returned to England on 12 September 1741, reaching London on the 14th.

==Early parliamentary career: 1741–1754==
By 1735, Walpole was a student at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He had long periods of absence from the college, often returning to Norwich to live at Houghton Hall, in Norfolk. Interested in local politics, he and the &quot;wealthy&quot; Mayor of Norwich, Philip Meadows, encouraged local merchant Thomas Vere to run for a seat in Parliament &quot;in the Whig interest&quot; with Vere becoming the MP for Norwich in 1735.

At the 1741 general election Walpole was elected as a Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Callington, Cornwall. He held this seat for thirteen years although he never visited Callington. Walpole entered Parliament shortly before his father&#x27;s fall from power. In December 1741 the Opposition won its first majority vote in the Commons for twenty years. In January 1742 Walpole&#x27;s government was still struggling in Parliament although by the end of the month Horace and other family members had successfully urged the Prime Minister to resign after a parliamentary defeat. Walpole&#x27;s philosophy mirrored that of Edmund Burke, who was his contemporary. He was a classical liberal on issues such as slavery and the American Revolution.

Walpole delivered his maiden speech on 19 March against the successful motion that a Secret Committee be set up to enquire into Sir Robert Walpole&#x27;s last ten years as prime minister. For the next three years, Walpole spent most of his time with his father at his country house Houghton Hall in Norfolk. His father died in 1745 and left Walpole the remainder of the lease of his house in Arlington Street, London; £5,000 in cash; and the office of Collector of the Customs (worth £1,000 per annum). However, he had died in debt, the total of which was in between £40,000 and £50,000.

In late 1745 Walpole and Gray resumed their friendship. Also that year the Jacobite Rising began. The position of Walpole was the fruit of his father&#x27;s support for the Hanoverian dynasty and he knew that he was in danger: 
:&quot;Now comes the Pretender&#x27;s boy, and promises all my comfortable apartments in the Exchequer and Custom House to some forlorn Irish peer, who chooses to remove his pride and poverty out of some large old unfurnished gallery at St. Germain&#x27;s. Why really, Mr. Montagu, this is not pleasant! I shall wonderfully dislike being a loyal sufferer in a threadbare coat, and shivering in an antechamber at Hanover, or reduced to teach Latin and English to the young princes at Copenhagen&quot;.

==Strawberry Hill==
Walpole&#x27;s lasting architectural creation is Strawberry Hill, the home he built from 1749 onward in Twickenham, southwest of London, which at the time overlooked the Thames. Here he revived the Gothic style many decades before his Victorian successors. Derided thereafter by his friends as &quot;The Abbot of Strawberry&quot;, this fanciful neo-Gothic concoction began a new architectural trend. Long-connected with the Blue Stockings Society, Walpole played host to its members and associates at Strawberry Hill, including Anna Laetitia Barbauld in 1774.

==Later parliamentary career: 1754–1768==
In the House of Commons, Walpole represented one of the many rotten boroughs, Castle Rising, which consisted of underlying freeholds in four villages near Kings Lynn, Norfolk, from 1754 until 1757. At his home, he hung a copy of the warrant for the execution of King Charles I with the inscription &quot;Major Charta&quot; and wrote of &quot;the least bad of all murders, that of a King&quot;. In 1756 he wrote:
Walpole worried that while his fellow Whigs fought amongst themselves, the Tories were gaining power, the result of which would be England delivered to an unlimited, absolute monarchy, &quot;that authority, that torrent which I should in vain extend a feeble arm to stem&quot;.

In 1757, he wrote the anonymous pamphlet &quot;A Letter from Xo Ho, a Chinese Philosopher at London, to his Friend Lien Chi at Peking&quot;, the first of his works to be widely reviewed.

In early 1757, old Horace Walpole of Wolterton died and was succeeded in the peerage by his son, who was then an MP for King&#x27;s Lynn, thereby creating a vacancy. The electors of King&#x27;s Lynn did not wish to be represented by a stranger and instead wanted someone with a connection to the Walpole family. The new Lord Walpole, therefore, wrote to his cousin requesting that he stand for the seat, saying his friends &quot;were all unanimously of opinion that you were the only person who from your near affinity to my grandfather, whose name is still in the greatest veneration, and your own known personal abilities and qualifications, could stand in the gap on this occasion and prevent opposition and expense and perhaps disgrace to the family&quot;.

In early 1757, Walpole was out of Parliament after vacating Castle Rising until his election that year to King&#x27;s Lynn, a seat he would hold until his retirement from the Commons in 1768.

Walpole became a prominent opponent of the 1757 decision to execute Admiral John Byng.

==Later life: 1768–1788==

Without a seat in Parliament, Walpole recognised his limitations as to political influence.

He wrote to Mann critical of the activities of the East India Company on 13 July 1773: 

He opposed the recent Catholic accommodative measures, writing to Mann in 1784: &quot;You know I have ever been averse to toleration of an intolerant religion&quot;. He wrote to the same correspondent in 1785 that &quot;as there are continually allusions to parliamentary speeches and events, they are often obscure to me till I get them explained; and besides, I do not know several of the satirized heroes even by sight&quot;. His political sympathies were with the Foxite Whigs, the successors of the Rockingham Whigs, who were themselves the successors of the Whig Party as revived by Walpole&#x27;s father. He wrote to William Mason, expounding his political philosophy:

==Last years: 1788–1797==

Walpole was horrified by the French Revolution and commended Edmund Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot;: &quot;Every page shows how sincerely he is in earnest — a wondrous merit in a political pamphlet—All other party writers &quot;act&quot; zeal for the public, but it never seems to flow from the heart&quot;. He admired the purple passage in the book on Marie Antoinette: &quot;I know the tirade on the Queen of France is condemned and yet I must avow I admire it much. It paints her exactly as she appeared to me the first time I saw her when Dauphiness. She...shot through the room like an aerial being, all brightness and grace and without seeming to touch earth&quot;.

After he heard of the execution of King Louis XVI he wrote to Lady Ossory on 29 January 1793:

He was not impressed with Thomas Paine&#x27;s reply to Burke, &quot;Rights of Man&quot;, writing that it was &quot;so coarse, that you would think he means to degrade the language as much as the government&quot;.

His father was created Earl of Orford in 1742. Horace&#x27;s elder brother, Robert Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford (), passed the title on to his son, George Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford (1730–1791). When the 3rd Earl died unmarried, Horace Walpole became, at the age of 74, the 4th Earl of Orford, and the title died with him in 1797. The massive amount of correspondence he left behind has been published in many volumes, starting in 1798. Likewise, a large collection of his works, including historical writings, was published immediately after his death.

Horace Walpole was buried in the same location as his father Sir Robert Walpole, at the Church of St Martin at Tours on the Houghton Hall estate.

==Rumours of paternity==
After Walpole&#x27;s death, Lady Louisa Stuart, in the introduction to the letters of her grandmother, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1837), wrote of rumours that Horace&#x27;s biological father was not Sir Robert Walpole but Carr, Lord Hervey (1691–1723), elder half-brother of the more famous John Hervey. T. H. White writes: &quot;Catherine Shorter, Sir Robert Walpole&#x27;s first wife, had five children. Four of them were born in a sequence after the marriage; the fifth, Horace, was born eleven years later, at a time when she was known to be on bad terms with Sir Robert, and known to be on romantic terms with Carr, Lord Hervey.&quot; The lack of physical resemblance between Horace and Sir Robert, and his close resemblance to members of the Hervey family, encouraged these rumours. Peter Cunningham, in his introduction to the letters of Horace Walpole (1857), vol. 1, p. x, wrote: 
==Personal characteristics==
Walpole had formed a number of lifelong friendships with a number of men and women notable for their looks, wit or social standing. Principal amongst those in his inner circle was arguably Conway, who he had looked up to since his Eton days and corresponded with for the rest of his life. He entertained himself with others who were like himself, and who possessed notoriety and wit, such as such as Etheldreda Townshend, and George Selwyn with whom he jousted and derided with streams of invective. The &quot;Abbot of Strawberry&quot; immortalised himself in his own words but also inspired the characters of &quot;Sir Benjamin Backbite&quot; in Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#x27;s The School for Scandal and &quot;Monsieur Le Sage&quot; in the satire &quot;Ranelagh House: a Satire in prose after the manner of Monsieur Le Sage&quot;.

The novelist Laetitia Matilda Hawkins, a younger contemporary of Walpole, wrote of him as follows:

In his old age, according to G. G. Cunningham, he &quot;was afflicted with fits of an hereditary gout which a rigid temperance failed to remove&quot;.

==Writings==
Strawberry Hill had its own printing press, the Strawberry Hill Press, which supported Horace Walpole&#x27;s intensive literary activity.

In 1764, not using his own press, he anonymously published his Gothic novel, &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot;, claiming on its title page that it was a translation &quot;from the Original Italian of Onuphrio Muralto&quot;. The second edition&#x27;s preface, according to James Watt, &quot;has often been regarded as a manifesto for the modern Gothic romance, stating that his work, now subtitled &#x27;A Gothic Story&#x27;, sought to restore the qualities of imagination and invention to contemporary fiction&quot;. However, there is a playfulness in the prefaces to both editions and in the narration within the text itself. The novel opens with the son of Manfred (the Prince of Otranto) being crushed under a massive helmet that appears as a result of supernatural causes. However, that moment, along with the rest of the unfolding plot, includes a mixture of both ridiculous and sublime supernatural elements. The plot finally reveals how Manfred&#x27;s family is tainted in a way that served as a model for successive Gothic plots.

From 1762 on, Walpole published his &quot;Anecdotes of Painting in England&quot;, based on George Vertue&#x27;s manuscript notes. His memoirs of the Georgian social and political scene, though heavily biased, are a useful primary source for historians.

Smith, noting that Walpole never did any work for his well-paid government sinecures, turns to the letters and argues that:
Walpole served his country, not by drudgery in the Exchequer and Customs, which paid him, but by transmitting to posterity an incomparable vision of England as it was in his day – London and Westminster with all their festivities and riots, the machinations of politicians and the turmoil of elections.

Walpole&#x27;s numerous letters are often used as a historical resource. In one, dating from 28 January 1754, he coined the word serendipity which he said was derived from a &quot;silly fairy tale&quot; he had read, &quot;The Three Princes of Serendip&quot;. The oft-quoted epigram, &quot;This world is a comedy to those that think, a tragedy to those that feel&quot;, is from a letter of Walpole&#x27;s to Anne, Countess of Upper Ossory, on 16 August 1776. The original, fuller version appeared in a letter to Sir Horace Mann on 31 December 1769: &quot;I have often said, and oftener think, that this world is a comedy to those that think, a tragedy to those that feel – a solution of why Democritus laughed and Heraclitus wept.&quot;

In &quot;Historic Doubts on the Life and Reign of King Richard III&quot; (1768), Walpole defended Richard III against the common belief that he murdered the Princes in the Tower. In this he has been followed by other writers, such as Josephine Tey and Valerie Anand. This work, according to Emile Legouis, shows that Walpole was &quot;capable of critical initiative&quot;. However, Walpole later changed his views following The Terror and declared that Richard could have committed the crimes of which he was accused.

==Walpole Society==
The Walpole Society was formed in 1911 to promote the study of the history of British art. Its headquarters is located in the Department of Prints and Drawings at The British Museum and its director is Simon Swynfen Jervis.

<text>Horace Oscar Axel Engdahl (born 30 December 1948) is a Swedish literary historian and critic, and has been a member of the Swedish Academy since 1997. He was the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy from 1999 to June 2009, when he was succeeded by Swedish author and historian Peter Englund.

==Biography==
Engdahl was born in Karlskrona, Blekinge, Sweden. He earned his B.A. in 1970 at Stockholm University; he earned his doctoral degree (PhD) in 1987, with a study on Swedish romanticism, but had meanwhile been active as a literary critic, translator and journal editor, and was one of the introducers of the continental tradition of literary scholarship in Sweden. He is adjunct professor of Scandinavian Literature at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. He speaks Swedish, English, German, French and Russian fluently.

Engdahl was member of the &quot;Kris&quot; editorial staff.

On 16 October 1997, Engdahl became a member of the Swedish Academy, elected to seat number 17 vacated by the death of Johannes Edfelt; on 1 June 1999, he succeeded Sture Allén as the Academy&#x27;s permanent secretary, i.e. its executive member and spokesperson. As such, he had the annual task of announcing the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature to the public. On 20 December 2008 it was announced that after ten years Engdahl would step down as the Academy&#x27;s permanent secretary on 1 June 2009.

Between 1989 and 2014 he was married to Ebba Witt-Brattström, professor of literature at Södertörn University outside Stockholm. They have three sons.

==Controversy==
In October 2008, Engdahl told the &quot;Associated Press&quot; that the United States is &quot;too isolated, too insular&quot; to challenge Europe as &quot;the center of the literary world&quot; and that &quot;they don&#x27;t translate enough and don&#x27;t really participate in the big dialogue of literature ...That ignorance is restraining.&quot; At the time of the interview, no American author had received a Nobel Prize in Literature since 1993. His comments generated controversy across the Atlantic, with Harold Augenbraum, head of the U.S. National Book Foundation offering to send him a reading list. 

In April 2018, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Engdahl had railed against former Academy members who left following allegations of sexual abuse by Jean-Claude Arnault.

<text>Hebrew (; &quot;ʿÎbrit&quot;) is a Northwest Semitic language within the Afroasiatic language family. A regional dialect of the Canaanite languages, it was natively spoken by the Israelites and remained in regular use as a first language until after 200 CE and as the liturgical language of Judaism (since the Second Temple period) and Samaritanism. The language was revived as a spoken language in the 19th century, and is the only successful large-scale example of linguistic revival. It is the only Canaanite language, as well as one of only two Northwest Semitic languages, with the other being Aramaic, still spoken today.

The earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date back to the 10th century BCE. Nearly all of the Hebrew Bible is written in Biblical Hebrew, with much of its present form in the dialect that scholars believe flourished around the 6th century BCE, during the time of the Babylonian captivity. For this reason, Hebrew has been referred to by Jews as &quot;Lashon Hakodesh&quot; (, ) since ancient times. The language was not referred to by the name &quot;Hebrew&quot; in the Bible, but as &quot;Yehudit&quot; () or &quot;Səpaṯ Kəna&#x27;an&quot; (). Mishnah Gittin 9:8 refers to the language as &quot;Ivrit&quot;, meaning Hebrew; however, Mishnah Megillah refers to the language as &quot;Ashurit&quot;, meaning Assyrian, which is derived from the name of the alphabet used, in contrast to &quot;Ivrit&quot;, meaning the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet.

Hebrew ceased to be a regular spoken language sometime between 200 and 400 CE, as it declined in the aftermath of the unsuccessful Bar Kokhba revolt, which was carried out against the Roman Empire by the Jews of Judaea. Aramaic and, to a lesser extent, Greek were already in use as international languages, especially among societal elites and immigrants. Hebrew survived into the medieval period as the language of Jewish liturgy, rabbinic literature, intra-Jewish commerce, and Jewish poetic literature. The first dated book printed in Hebrew was published by Abraham Garton in Reggio (Calabria, Italy) in 1475. 

With the rise of Zionism in the 19th century, the Hebrew language experienced a full-scale revival as a spoken and literary language. The creation of a modern version of the ancient language was led by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda. Modern Hebrew (&quot;Ivrit&quot;) became the main language of the Yishuv in Palestine, and subsequently the official language of the State of Israel. Estimates of worldwide usage include five million speakers in 1998, and over nine million people in 2013. After Israel, the United States has the largest Hebrew-speaking population, with approximately 220,000 fluent speakers (see Israeli Americans and Jewish Americans). 

Modern Hebrew is the official language of the State of Israel, while pre-revival forms of Hebrew are used for prayer or study in Jewish and Samaritan communities around the world today; the latter group utilizes the Samaritan dialect as their liturgical tongue. As a non-first language, it is studied mostly by non-Israeli Jews and students in Israel, by archaeologists and linguists specializing in the Middle East and its civilizations, and by theologians in Christian seminaries.

==Etymology==
The modern English word &quot;Hebrew&quot; is derived from Old French , via Latin from the Ancient Greek () and Aramaic &quot;&#x27;ibrāy&quot;, all ultimately derived from Biblical Hebrew (), one of several names for the Israelite (Jewish and Samaritan) people (Hebrews). It is traditionally understood to be an adjective based on the name of Abraham&#x27;s ancestor, Eber, mentioned in . The name is believed to be based on the Semitic root &quot;ʕ-b-r&quot; (), meaning &quot;beyond&quot;, &quot;other side&quot;, &quot;across&quot;; interpretations of the term &quot;Hebrew&quot; generally render its meaning as roughly &quot;from the other side [of the river/desert]&quot;—i.e., an exonym for the inhabitants of the land of Israel and Judah, perhaps from the perspective of Mesopotamia, Phoenicia or Transjordan (with the river referred to being perhaps the Euphrates, Jordan or Litani; or maybe the northern Arabian Desert between Babylonia and Canaan). Compare the word &quot;Habiru&quot; or cognate Assyrian &quot;ebru&quot;, of identical meaning.

One of the earliest references to the language&#x27;s name as &quot;Ivrit&quot; is found in the prologue to the Book of Sirach, from the 2nd century BCE. The Hebrew Bible does not use the term &quot;Hebrew&quot; in reference to the language of the Hebrew people; its later historiography, in the Book of Kings, refers to it as &quot;Yehudit&quot; &quot;Judahite (language)&quot;.

==History==
Hebrew belongs to the Canaanite group of languages. Canaanite languages are a branch of the Northwest Semitic family of languages.

Hebrew was the spoken language in the Iron Age kingdoms of Israel and Judah during the period from about 1200 to 586 BCE. Epigraphic evidence from this period confirms the widely accepted view that the earlier layers of biblical literature reflect the language used in these kingdoms. Furthermore, the content of Hebrew inscriptions suggests that the written texts closely mirror the spoken language of that time.

Scholars debate the degree to which Hebrew was a spoken vernacular in ancient times following the Babylonian exile when the predominant international language in the region was Old Aramaic.

Hebrew was extinct as a colloquial language by late antiquity, but it continued to be used as a literary language, especially in Spain, as the language of commerce between Jews of different native languages, and as the liturgical language of Judaism, evolving various dialects of literary Medieval Hebrew, until its revival as a spoken language in the late 19th century.

===Oldest Hebrew inscriptions===
In May 2023, Scott Stripling published the finding of what he claims to be the oldest known Hebrew inscription, a curse tablet found at Mount Ebal, dated from around 3200 years ago. The presence of the Hebrew name of god, Yahweh, as three letters, &quot;Yod-Heh-Vav&quot; (YHV), according to the author and his team meant that the tablet is Hebrew and not Canaanite. However, practically all professional archeologists and epigraphers apart from Stripling&#x27;s team claim that there is no text on this object.

In July 2008, Israeli archaeologist Yossi Garfinkel discovered a ceramic shard at Khirbet Qeiyafa that he claimed may be the earliest Hebrew writing yet discovered, dating from around 3,000 years ago. Hebrew University archaeologist Amihai Mazar said that the inscription was &quot;proto-Canaanite&quot; but cautioned that differentiation between the scripts, and between the languages themselves in that period, remains unclear&quot;, and suggested that calling the text Hebrew might be going too far.

The Gezer calendar also dates back to the 10th century BCE at the beginning of the Monarchic period, the traditional time of the reign of David and Solomon. Classified as Archaic Biblical Hebrew, the calendar presents a list of seasons and related agricultural activities. The Gezer calendar (named after the city in whose proximity it was found) is written in an old Semitic script, akin to the Phoenician one that, through the Greeks and Etruscans, later became the Latin alphabet of ancient Rome. The Gezer calendar is written without any vowels, and it does not use consonants to imply vowels even in the places in which later Hebrew spelling requires them.

Numerous older tablets have been found in the region with similar scripts written in other Semitic languages, for example, Proto-Sinaitic. It is believed that the original shapes of the script go back to Egyptian hieroglyphs, though the phonetic values are instead inspired by the acrophonic principle. The common ancestor of Hebrew and Phoenician is called Canaanite, and was the first to use a Semitic alphabet distinct from that of Egyptian. One ancient document is the famous Moabite Stone, written in the Moabite dialect; the Siloam inscription, found near Jerusalem, is an early example of Hebrew. Less ancient samples of Archaic Hebrew include the ostraca found near Lachish, which describe events preceding the final capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian captivity of 586 BCE.

===Classical Hebrew===
====Biblical Hebrew====

In its widest sense, Biblical Hebrew refers to the spoken language of ancient Israel flourishing between and . It comprises several evolving and overlapping dialects. The phases of Classical Hebrew are often named after important literary works associated with them.
* Archaic Biblical Hebrew, also called Old Hebrew or Paleo-Hebrew, from the 10th to the 6th century BCE, corresponding to the Monarchic Period until the Babylonian exile and represented by certain texts in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), notably the Song of Moses (Exodus 15) and the Song of Deborah (Judges 5). It was written in the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet. A script descended from this, the Samaritan alphabet, is still used by the Samaritans.
* Standard Biblical Hebrew, also called Biblical Hebrew, Early Biblical Hebrew, Classical Biblical Hebrew or Classical Hebrew (in the narrowest sense), around the 8th to 6th centuries BCE, corresponding to the late Monarchic period and the Babylonian exile. It is represented by the bulk of the Hebrew Bible that attains much of its present form around this time.
* Late Biblical Hebrew, from the 5th to the 3rd centuries BCE, corresponding to the Persian period and represented by certain texts in the Hebrew Bible, notably the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. Basically similar to Classical Biblical Hebrew, apart from a few foreign words adopted for mainly governmental terms, and some syntactical innovations such as the use of the particle &quot;she-&quot; (alternative of &quot;asher&quot;, meaning &quot;that, which, who&quot;). It adopted the Imperial Aramaic script (from which the modern Hebrew script descends).
* Israelian Hebrew is a proposed northern dialect of biblical Hebrew, believed to have existed in all eras of the language, in some cases competing with late biblical Hebrew as an explanation for non-standard linguistic features of biblical texts.

====Early post-Biblical Hebrew====
* Dead Sea Scroll Hebrew from the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE, corresponding to the Hellenistic and Roman Periods before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, and represented by the Qumran Scrolls that form most (but not all) of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Commonly abbreviated as DSS Hebrew, also called Qumran Hebrew. The Imperial Aramaic script of the earlier scrolls in the 3rd century BCE evolved into the Hebrew square script of the later scrolls in the 1st century CE, also known as &quot;ketav Ashuri&quot; (Assyrian script), still in use today.
* Mishnaic Hebrew from the 1st to the 3rd or 4th century CE, corresponding to the Roman Period after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and represented by the bulk of the Mishnah and Tosefta within the Talmud and by the Dead Sea Scrolls, notably the Bar Kokhba letters and the Copper Scroll. Also called Tannaitic Hebrew or Early Rabbinic Hebrew.

Sometimes the above phases of spoken Classical Hebrew are simplified into &quot;Biblical Hebrew&quot; (including several dialects from the 10th century BCE to 2nd century BCE and extant in certain Dead Sea Scrolls) and &quot;Mishnaic Hebrew&quot; (including several dialects from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE and extant in certain other Dead Sea Scrolls). However, today most Hebrew linguists classify Dead Sea Scroll Hebrew as a set of dialects evolving out of Late Biblical Hebrew and into Mishnaic Hebrew, thus including elements from both but remaining distinct from either.

By the start of the Byzantine Period in the 4th century CE, Classical Hebrew ceased as a regularly spoken language, roughly a century after the publication of the Mishnah, apparently declining since the aftermath of the catastrophic Bar Kokhba revolt around 135 CE.

===Displacement by Aramaic===


In the early 6th century BCE, the Neo-Babylonian Empire conquered the ancient Kingdom of Judah, destroying much of Jerusalem and exiling its population far to the east in Babylon. During the Babylonian captivity, many Israelites learned Aramaic, the closely related Semitic language of their captors. Thus, for a significant period, the Jewish elite became influenced by Aramaic.

After Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon, he allowed the Jewish people to return from captivity. In time, a local version of Aramaic came to be spoken in Israel alongside Hebrew. By the beginning of the Common Era, Aramaic was the primary colloquial language of Samarian, Babylonian and Galileean Jews, and western and intellectual Jews spoke Greek, but a form of so-called Rabbinic Hebrew continued to be used as a vernacular in Judea until it was displaced by Aramaic, probably in the 3rd century CE. Certain Sadducee, Pharisee, Scribe, Hermit, Zealot and Priest classes maintained an insistence on Hebrew, and all Jews maintained their identity with Hebrew songs and simple quotations from Hebrew texts.

While there is no doubt that at a certain point, Hebrew was displaced as the everyday spoken language of most Jews, and that its chief successor in the Middle East was the closely related Aramaic language, then Greek, scholarly opinions on the exact dating of that shift have changed very much. In the first half of the 20th century, most scholars followed Abraham Geiger and Gustaf Dalman in thinking that Aramaic became a spoken language in the land of Israel as early as the beginning of Israel&#x27;s Hellenistic period in the 4th century BCE, and that as a corollary Hebrew ceased to function as a spoken language around the same time. Moshe Zvi Segal, Joseph Klausner and Ben Yehuda are notable exceptions to this view. During the latter half of the 20th century, accumulating archaeological evidence and especially linguistic analysis of the Dead Sea Scrolls has disproven that view. The Dead Sea Scrolls, uncovered in 1946–1948 near Qumran revealed ancient Jewish texts overwhelmingly in Hebrew, not Aramaic.

The Qumran scrolls indicate that Hebrew texts were readily understandable to the average Jew, and that the language had evolved since Biblical times as spoken languages do. Recent scholarship recognizes that reports of Jews speaking in Aramaic indicate a multilingual society, not necessarily the primary language spoken. Alongside Aramaic, Hebrew co-existed within Israel as a spoken language. Most scholars now date the demise of Hebrew as a spoken language to the end of the Roman period, or about 200 CE. It continued on as a literary language down through the Byzantine period from the 4th century CE.

The exact roles of Aramaic and Hebrew remain hotly debated. A trilingual scenario has been proposed for the land of Israel. Hebrew functioned as the local mother tongue with powerful ties to Israel&#x27;s history, origins and golden age and as the language of Israel&#x27;s religion; Aramaic functioned as the international language with the rest of the Middle East; and eventually Greek functioned as another international language with the eastern areas of the Roman Empire. William Schniedewind argues that after waning in the Persian period, the religious importance of Hebrew grew in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, and cites epigraphical evidence that Hebrew survived as a vernacular language – though both its grammar and its writing system had been substantially influenced by Aramaic. According to another summary, Greek was the language of government, Hebrew the language of prayer, study and religious texts, and Aramaic was the language of legal contracts and trade. There was also a geographic pattern: according to Bernard Spolsky, by the beginning of the Common Era, &quot;Judeo-Aramaic was mainly used in Galilee in the north, Greek was concentrated in the former colonies and around governmental centers, and Hebrew monolingualism continued mainly in the southern villages of Judea.&quot; In other words, &quot;in terms of dialect geography, at the time of the tannaim Palestine could be divided into the Aramaic-speaking regions of Galilee and Samaria and a smaller area, Judaea, in which Rabbinic Hebrew was used among the descendants of returning exiles.&quot; In addition, it has been surmised that Koine Greek was the primary vehicle of communication in coastal cities and among the upper class of Jerusalem, while Aramaic was prevalent in the lower class of Jerusalem, but not in the surrounding countryside. After the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in the 2nd century CE, Judaeans were forced to disperse. Many relocated to Galilee, so most remaining native speakers of Hebrew at that last stage would have been found in the north.

Many scholars have pointed out that Hebrew continued to be used alongside Aramaic during Second Temple times, not only for religious purposes but also for nationalistic reasons, especially during revolts such as the Maccabean Revolt (167–160 BCE) and the emergence of the Hasmonean kingdom, the Great Jewish Revolt (66–73 CE), and the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–135 CE). The nationalist significance of Hebrew manifested in various ways throughout this period. Michael Owen Wise notes that &quot;Beginning with the time of the Hasmonean revolt [...] Hebrew came to the fore in an expression akin to modern nationalism. A form of classical Hebrew was now a more significant written language than Aramaic within Judaea.&quot; This nationalist aspect was further emphasized during periods of conflict, as Hannah Cotton observing in her analysis of legal documents during the Jewish revolts against Rome that &quot;Hebrew became the symbol of Jewish nationalism, of the independent Jewish State.&quot; The nationalist use of Hebrew is evidenced in several historical documents and artefacts, including the composition of 1 Maccabees in archaizing Hebrew, Hasmonean coinage under John Hyrcanus (134-104 BCE), and coins from both the Great Revolt and Bar Kokhba Revolt featuring exclusively Hebrew and Palaeo-Hebrew script inscriptions. This deliberate use of Hebrew and Paleo-Hebrew script in official contexts, despite limited literacy, served as a symbol of Jewish nationalism and political independence.

The Christian New Testament contains some Semitic place names and quotes. The language of such Semitic glosses (and in general the language spoken by Jews in scenes from the New Testament) is often referred to as &quot;Hebrew&quot; in the text, although this term is often re-interpreted as referring to Aramaic instead and is rendered accordingly in recent translations. Nonetheless, these glosses can be interpreted as Hebrew as well. It has been argued that Hebrew, rather than Aramaic or Koine Greek, lay behind the composition of the Gospel of Matthew. (See the Hebrew Gospel hypothesis or Language of Jesus for more details on Hebrew and Aramaic in the gospels.)

===Mishnah and Talmud===

The term &quot;Mishnaic Hebrew&quot; generally refers to the Hebrew dialects found in the Talmud, excepting quotations from the Hebrew Bible. The dialects organize into Mishnaic Hebrew (also called Tannaitic Hebrew, Early Rabbinic Hebrew, or Mishnaic Hebrew I), which was a spoken language, and Amoraic Hebrew (also called Late Rabbinic Hebrew or Mishnaic Hebrew II), which was a literary language. The earlier section of the Talmud is the Mishnah that was published around 200 CE, although many of the stories take place much earlier, and were written in the earlier Mishnaic dialect. The dialect is also found in certain Dead Sea Scrolls. Mishnaic Hebrew is considered to be one of the dialects of Classical Hebrew that functioned as a living language in the land of Israel. A transitional form of the language occurs in the other works of Tannaitic literature dating from the century beginning with the completion of the Mishnah. These include the halachic Midrashim (Sifra, Sifre, Mekhilta etc.) and the expanded collection of Mishnah-related material known as the Tosefta. The Talmud contains excerpts from these works, as well as further Tannaitic material not attested elsewhere; the generic term for these passages is &quot;Baraitot&quot;. The dialect of all these works is very similar to Mishnaic Hebrew.

About a century after the publication of the Mishnah, Mishnaic Hebrew fell into disuse as a spoken language. By the third century CE, sages could no longer identify the Hebrew names of many plants mentioned in the Mishnah. Only a few sages, primarily in the southern regions, retained the ability to speak the language and attempted to promote its use. According to the Jerusalem Talmud, Megillah 1:9: &quot;Rebbi Jonathan from Bet Guvrrin said, four languages are appropriate that the world should use them, and they are these: The Foreign Language (Greek) for song, Latin for war, Syriac for elegies, Hebrew for speech. Some are saying, also Assyrian (Hebrew script) for writing.&quot;

The later section of the Talmud, the Gemara, generally comments on the Mishnah and Baraitot in two forms of Aramaic. Nevertheless, Hebrew survived as a liturgical and literary language in the form of later Amoraic Hebrew, which occasionally appears in the text of the Gemara, particularly in the Jerusalem Talmud and the classical aggadah midrashes.

Hebrew was always regarded as the language of Israel&#x27;s religion, history and national pride, and after it faded as a spoken language, it continued to be used as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; among scholars and Jews traveling in foreign countries. After the 2nd century CE when the Roman Empire exiled most of the Jewish population of Jerusalem following the Bar Kokhba revolt, they adapted to the societies in which they found themselves, yet letters, contracts, commerce, science, philosophy, medicine, poetry and laws continued to be written mostly in Hebrew, which adapted by borrowing and inventing terms.

===Medieval Hebrew===


After the Talmud, various regional literary dialects of Medieval Hebrew evolved. The most important is Tiberian Hebrew or Masoretic Hebrew, a local dialect of Tiberias in Galilee that became the standard for vocalizing the Hebrew Bible and thus still influences all other regional dialects of Hebrew. This Tiberian Hebrew from the 7th to 10th century CE is sometimes called &quot;Biblical Hebrew&quot; because it is used to pronounce the Hebrew Bible; however, properly it should be distinguished from the historical Biblical Hebrew of the 6th century BCE, whose original pronunciation must be reconstructed. Tiberian Hebrew incorporates the scholarship of the Masoretes (from &quot;masoret&quot; meaning &quot;tradition&quot;), who added vowel points and grammar points to the Hebrew letters to preserve much earlier features of Hebrew, for use in chanting the Hebrew Bible. The Masoretes inherited a biblical text whose letters were considered too sacred to be altered, so their markings were in the form of pointing in and around the letters. The Syriac alphabet, precursor to the Arabic alphabet, also developed vowel pointing systems around this time. The Aleppo Codex, a Hebrew Bible with the Masoretic pointing, was written in the 10th century, likely in Tiberias, and survives into the present day. It is perhaps the most important Hebrew manuscript in existence.

During the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain, important work was done by grammarians in explaining the grammar and vocabulary of Biblical Hebrew; much of this was based on the work of the grammarians of Classical Arabic. Important Hebrew grammarians were , Jonah ibn Janah, Abraham ibn Ezra and later (in Provence), . A great deal of poetry was written, by poets such as , Solomon ibn Gabirol, Judah ha-Levi, Moses ibn Ezra and Abraham ibn Ezra, in a &quot;purified&quot; Hebrew based on the work of these grammarians, and in Arabic quantitative or strophic meters. This literary Hebrew was later used by Italian Jewish poets.

The need to express scientific and philosophical concepts from Classical Greek and Medieval Arabic motivated Medieval Hebrew to borrow terminology and grammar from these other languages, or to coin equivalent terms from existing Hebrew roots, giving rise to a distinct style of philosophical Hebrew. This is used in the translations made by the family. (Original Jewish philosophical works were usually written in Arabic.) Another important influence was Maimonides, who developed a simple style based on Mishnaic Hebrew for use in his law code, the . Subsequent rabbinic literature is written in a blend between this style and the Aramaized Rabbinic Hebrew of the Talmud.

Hebrew persevered through the ages as the main language for written purposes by all Jewish communities around the world for a large range of uses—not only liturgy, but also poetry, philosophy, science and medicine, commerce, daily correspondence and contracts. There have been many deviations from this generalization such as Bar Kokhba&#x27;s letters to his lieutenants, which were mostly in Aramaic, and Maimonides&#x27; writings, which were mostly in Arabic; but overall, Hebrew did not cease to be used for such purposes. For example, the first Middle East printing press, in Safed (modern Israel), produced a small number of books in Hebrew in 1577, which were then sold to the nearby Jewish world. This meant not only that well-educated Jews in all parts of the world could correspond in a mutually intelligible language, and that books and legal documents published or written in any part of the world could be read by Jews in all other parts, but that an educated Jew could travel and converse with Jews in distant places, just as priests and other educated Christians could converse in Latin. For example, Rabbi Avraham Danzig wrote the &#x27; in Hebrew, as opposed to Yiddish, as a guide to &quot;Halacha&quot; for the &quot;&quot;average&quot; 17-year-old&quot; (Ibid. Introduction 1). Similarly, Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan&#x27;s purpose in writing the &#x27; was to &quot;produce a work that could be studied daily so that Jews might know the proper procedures to follow minute by minute&quot;. The work was nevertheless written in Talmudic Hebrew and Aramaic, since, &quot;the ordinary Jew [of Eastern Europe] of a century ago, was fluent enough in this idiom to be able to follow the Mishna Berurah without any trouble.&quot;

===Revival===
Hebrew has been revived several times as a literary language, most significantly by the Haskalah (Enlightenment) movement of early and mid-19th-century Germany. In the early 19th century, a form of spoken Hebrew had emerged in the markets of Jerusalem between Jews of different linguistic backgrounds to communicate for commercial purposes. This Hebrew dialect was to a certain extent a pidgin. Near the end of that century the Jewish activist Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, owing to the ideology of the national revival (, , later Zionism), began reviving Hebrew as a modern spoken language. Eventually, as a result of the local movement he created, but more significantly as a result of the new groups of immigrants known under the name of the Second Aliyah, it replaced a score of languages spoken by Jews at that time. Those languages were Jewish dialects of local languages, including Judaeo-Spanish (also called &quot;Judezmo&quot; and &quot;Ladino&quot;), Yiddish, Judeo-Arabic and Bukhori (Tajiki), or local languages spoken in the Jewish diaspora such as Russian, Persian and Arabic.

The major result of the literary work of the Hebrew intellectuals along the 19th century was a lexical modernization of Hebrew. New words and expressions were adapted as neologisms from the large corpus of Hebrew writings since the Hebrew Bible, or borrowed from Arabic (mainly by Ben-Yehuda) and older Aramaic and Latin. Many new words were either borrowed from or coined after European languages, especially English, Russian, German, and French. Modern Hebrew became an official language in British-ruled Palestine in 1921 (along with English and Arabic), and then in 1948 became an official language of the newly declared State of Israel. Hebrew is the most widely spoken language in Israel today.

In the Modern Period, from the 19th century onward, the literary Hebrew tradition revived as the spoken language of modern Israel, called variously &quot;Israeli Hebrew&quot;, &quot;Modern Israeli Hebrew&quot;, &quot;Modern Hebrew&quot;, &quot;New Hebrew&quot;, &quot;Israeli Standard Hebrew&quot;, &quot;Standard Hebrew&quot; and so on. Israeli Hebrew exhibits some features of Sephardic Hebrew from its local Jerusalemite tradition but adapts it with numerous neologisms, borrowed terms (often technical) from European languages and adopted terms (often colloquial) from Arabic.

The literary and narrative use of Hebrew was revived beginning with the Haskalah movement. The first secular periodical in Hebrew, (The Gatherer), was published by maskilim in Königsberg (today&#x27;s Kaliningrad) from 1783 onwards. In the mid-19th century, publications of several Eastern European Hebrew-language newspapers (e.g. , founded in Ełk in 1856) multiplied. Prominent poets were Hayim Nahman Bialik and Shaul Tchernichovsky; there were also novels written in the language.

The revival of the Hebrew language as a mother tongue was initiated in the late 19th century by the efforts of Ben-Yehuda. He joined the Jewish national movement and in 1881 immigrated to Palestine, then a part of the Ottoman Empire. Motivated by the surrounding ideals of renovation and rejection of the diaspora &quot;shtetl&quot; lifestyle, Ben-Yehuda set out to develop tools for making the literary and liturgical language into everyday spoken language. However, his brand of Hebrew followed norms that had been replaced in Eastern Europe by different grammar and style, in the writings of people like Ahad Ha&#x27;am and others. His organizational efforts and involvement with the establishment of schools and the writing of textbooks pushed the vernacularization activity into a gradually accepted movement. It was not, however, until the 1904–1914 Second Aliyah that Hebrew had caught real momentum in Ottoman Palestine with the more highly organized enterprises set forth by the new group of immigrants. When the British Mandate of Palestine recognized Hebrew as one of the country&#x27;s three official languages (English, Arabic, and Hebrew, in 1922), its new formal status contributed to its diffusion. A constructed modern language with a truly Semitic vocabulary and written appearance, although often European in phonology, was to take its place among the current languages of the nations.

While many saw his work as fanciful or even blasphemous (because Hebrew was the holy language of the Torah and therefore some thought that it should not be used to discuss everyday matters), many soon understood the need for a common language amongst Jews of the British Mandate who at the turn of the 20th century were arriving in large numbers from diverse countries and speaking different languages. A Committee of the Hebrew Language was established. After the establishment of Israel, it became the Academy of the Hebrew Language. The results of Ben-Yehuda&#x27;s lexicographical work were published in a dictionary (&quot;The Complete Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Hebrew&quot;, Ben-Yehuda Dictionary). The seeds of Ben-Yehuda&#x27;s work fell on fertile ground, and by the beginning of the 20th century, Hebrew was well on its way to becoming the main language of the Jewish population of both Ottoman and British Palestine. At the time, members of the Old Yishuv and a very few Hasidic sects, most notably those under the auspices of Satmar, refused to speak Hebrew and spoke only Yiddish.

In the Soviet Union, the use of Hebrew, along with other Jewish cultural and religious activities, was suppressed. Soviet authorities considered the use of Hebrew &quot;reactionary&quot; since it was associated with Zionism, and the teaching of Hebrew at primary and secondary schools was officially banned by the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Education as early as 1919, as part of an overall agenda aiming to secularize education (the language itself did not cease to be studied at universities for historical and linguistic purposes). The official ordinance stated that Yiddish, being the spoken language of the Russian Jews, should be treated as their only national language, while Hebrew was to be treated as a foreign language. Hebrew books and periodicals ceased to be published and were seized from the libraries, although liturgical texts were still published until the 1930s. Despite numerous protests, a policy of suppression of the teaching of Hebrew operated from the 1930s on. Later in the 1980s in the USSR, Hebrew studies reappeared due to people struggling for permission to go to Israel (refuseniks). Several of the teachers were imprisoned, e.g. Yosef Begun, Ephraim Kholmyansky, Yevgeny Korostyshevsky and others responsible for a Hebrew learning network connecting many cities of the USSR.

===Modern Hebrew===


Standard Hebrew, as developed by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, was based on Mishnaic spelling and Sephardi Hebrew pronunciation. However, the earliest speakers of Modern Hebrew had Yiddish as their native language and often introduced calques from Yiddish and phono-semantic matchings of international words.

Despite using Sephardic Hebrew pronunciation as its primary basis, modern Israeli Hebrew has adapted to Ashkenazi Hebrew phonology in some respects, mainly the following:

* the replacement of pharyngeal articulation in the letters &quot;chet&quot; () and &quot;ayin&quot; () by most Hebrew speakers with uvular [] and glottal [], respectively, by most Hebrew speakers.
* the conversion of () from an alveolar flap to a voiced uvular fricative or uvular trill , by most of the speakers, like in most varieties of standard German or Yiddish. &quot;see Guttural R&quot;
* the pronunciation (by many speakers) of &quot;tzere&quot; &lt;&gt; as in some contexts (&quot;sifréj&quot; and &quot;téjša&quot; instead of Sephardic &quot;sifré&quot; and &quot;tésha&quot;)
* the partial elimination of vocal &quot;Shva&quot; &lt;&gt; (&quot;zmán&quot; instead of Sephardic &quot;zĕman&quot;)
* in popular speech, penultimate stress in proper names (&quot;Dvóra&quot; instead of &quot;Dĕvorá&quot;; &quot;Yehúda&quot; instead of &quot;Yĕhudá&quot;) and some other words
* similarly in popular speech, penultimate stress in verb forms with a second person plural suffix (&quot;katávtem&quot; &quot;you wrote&quot; instead of &quot;kĕtavtém&quot;).

The vocabulary of Israeli Hebrew is much larger than that of earlier periods. According to Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann:

In Israel, Modern Hebrew is currently taught in institutions called Ulpanim (singular: Ulpan). There are government-owned, as well as private, Ulpanim offering online courses and face-to-face programs.

==Current status==
Modern Hebrew is the primary official language of the State of Israel. , there are about 9 million Hebrew speakers worldwide, of whom 7 million speak it fluently.

Currently, 90% of Israeli Jews are proficient in Hebrew, and 70% are highly proficient. Some 60% of Israeli Arabs are also proficient in Hebrew, and 30% report having a higher proficiency in Hebrew than in Arabic. In total, about 53% of the Israeli population speaks Hebrew as a native language, while most of the rest speak it fluently. In 2013 Hebrew was the native language of 49% of Israelis over the age of 20, with Russian, Arabic, French, English, Yiddish and Ladino being the native tongues of most of the rest. Some 26% of immigrants from the former Soviet Union and 12% of Arabs reported speaking Hebrew poorly or not at all.

Steps have been taken to keep Hebrew the primary language of use, and to prevent large-scale incorporation of English words into the Hebrew vocabulary. The Academy of the Hebrew Language of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem currently invents about 2,000 new Hebrew words each year for modern words by finding an original Hebrew word that captures the meaning, as an alternative to incorporating more English words into Hebrew vocabulary. The Haifa municipality has banned officials from using English words in official documents, and is fighting to stop businesses from using only English signs to market their services. In 2012, a Knesset bill for the preservation of the Hebrew language was proposed, which includes the stipulation that all signage in Israel must first and foremost be in Hebrew, as with all speeches by Israeli officials abroad. The bill&#x27;s author, MK Akram Hasson, stated that the bill was proposed as a response to Hebrew &quot;losing its prestige&quot; and children incorporating more English words into their vocabulary.

Hebrew is one of several languages for which the constitution of South Africa calls to be respected in their use for religious purposes. Also, Hebrew is an official national minority language in Poland, since 6 January 2005. Hamas has made Hebrew a compulsory language taught in schools in the Gaza Strip.

==Phonology==
Biblical Hebrew had a typical Semitic consonant inventory, with pharyngeal , a series of &quot;emphatic&quot; consonants (possibly ejective, but this is debated), lateral fricative , and in its older stages also uvular . merged into in later Biblical Hebrew, and underwent allophonic spirantization to (known as begadkefat). The earliest Biblical Hebrew vowel system contained the Proto-Semitic vowels as well as , but this system changed dramatically over time.

By the time of the Dead Sea Scrolls, had shifted to in the Jewish traditions, though for the Samaritans it merged with instead. The Tiberian reading tradition of the Middle Ages had the vowel system , though other Medieval reading traditions had fewer vowels.

A number of reading traditions have been preserved in liturgical use. In Oriental (Sephardi and Mizrahi) Jewish reading traditions, the emphatic consonants are realized as pharyngealized, while the Ashkenazi (northern and eastern European) traditions have lost emphatics and pharyngeals (although according to Ashkenazi law, pharyngeal articulation is preferred over uvular or glottal articulation when representing the community in religious service such as prayer and Torah reading), and show the shift of to . The Samaritan tradition has a complex vowel system that does not correspond closely to the Tiberian systems.

Modern Hebrew pronunciation developed from a mixture of the different Jewish reading traditions, generally tending towards simplification. In line with Sephardi Hebrew pronunciation, emphatic consonants have shifted to their ordinary counterparts, to , and are not present. Most Israelis today also merge with , do not have contrastive gemination, and pronounce as a uvular fricative or a voiced velar fricative rather than an alveolar trill, because of Ashkenazi Hebrew influences. The consonants and have become phonemic due to loan words, and has similarly been re-introduced.

===Consonants===

Notes:
# Proto-Semitic was still pronounced as in Biblical Hebrew, but no letter was available in the Phoenician alphabet, so the letter had two pronunciations, representing both and . Later on, however, merged with , but the old spelling was largely retained, and the two pronunciations of were distinguished graphically in Tiberian Hebrew as vs. &lt; .
# Biblical Hebrew as of the 3rd century BCE apparently still distinguished the phonemes versus and versus , as witnessed by transcriptions in the Septuagint. As in the case of , no letters were available to represent these sounds, and existing letters did double duty: for and for . In all of these cases, however, the sounds represented by the same letter eventually merged, leaving no evidence (other than early transcriptions) of the former distinctions.
# Hebrew and Aramaic underwent begadkefat spirantization at a certain point, whereby the stop sounds were softened to the corresponding fricatives (written &quot;ḇ ḡ ḏ ḵ p̄ ṯ&quot;) when occurring after a vowel and not geminated. This change probably happened after the original Old Aramaic phonemes disappeared in the 7th century BCE, and most likely occurred after the loss of Hebrew . It is known to have occurred in Hebrew by the 2nd century. After a certain point this alternation became contrastive in word-medial and final position (though bearing low functional load), but in word-initial position they remained allophonic. In Modern Hebrew, the distinction has a higher functional load due to the loss of gemination, although only the three fricatives are still preserved (the fricative is pronounced in modern Hebrew). (The others are pronounced like the corresponding stops, as Modern Hebrew pronunciation was based on the Sephardic pronunciation which lost the distinction)

==Grammar==
Hebrew grammar is partly analytic, expressing such forms as dative, ablative and accusative using prepositional particles rather than grammatical cases. However, inflection plays a decisive role in the formation of verbs and nouns. For example, nouns have a construct state, called &quot;smikhut&quot;, to denote the relationship of &quot;belonging to&quot;: this is the converse of the genitive case of more inflected languages. Words in &quot;smikhut&quot; are often combined with hyphens. In modern speech, the use of the construct is sometimes interchangeable with the preposition &quot;shel&quot;, meaning &quot;of&quot;. There are many cases, however, where older declined forms are retained (especially in idiomatic expressions and the like), and &quot;person&quot;-enclitics are widely used to &quot;decline&quot; prepositions.

===Morphology===
Like all Semitic languages, the Hebrew language exhibits a pattern of stems consisting typically of &quot;triliteral&quot;, or 3-consonant consonantal roots, from which nouns, adjectives, and verbs are formed in various ways: e.g. by inserting vowels, doubling consonants, lengthening vowels and/or adding prefixes, suffixes or infixes. 4-consonant roots also exist and became more frequent in the modern language due to a process of coining verbs from nouns that are themselves constructed from 3-consonant verbs. Some triliteral roots lose one of their consonants in most forms and are called &quot;Nakhim&quot; (Resting).

Hebrew uses a number of one-letter prefixes that are added to words for various purposes. These are called inseparable prepositions or &quot;Letters of Use&quot; (). Such items include: the definite article &quot;ha-&quot; () (= &quot;the&quot;); prepositions &quot;be-&quot; () (= &quot;in&quot;), &quot;le-&quot; () (= &quot;to&quot;; a shortened version of the preposition &quot;el&quot;), &quot;mi-&quot; () (= &quot;from&quot;; a shortened version of the preposition &quot;min&quot;); conjunctions &quot;ve-&quot; () (= &quot;and&quot;), &quot;she-&quot; () (= &quot;that&quot;; a shortened version of the Biblical conjunction &quot;asher&quot;), &quot;ke-&quot; () (= &quot;as&quot;, &quot;like&quot;; a shortened version of the conjunction &quot;kmo&quot;).

The vowel accompanying each of these letters may differ from those listed above, depending on the first letter or vowel following it. The rules governing these changes are hardly observed in colloquial speech as most speakers tend to employ the regular form. However, they may be heard in more formal circumstances. For example, if a preposition is put before a word that begins with a moving Shva, then the preposition takes the vowel (and the initial consonant may be weakened): colloquial &quot;be-kfar&quot; (= &quot;in a village&quot;) corresponds to the more formal &quot;bi-khfar&quot;.

The definite article may be inserted between a preposition or a conjunction and the word it refers to, creating composite words like &quot;mé-ha-kfar&quot; (= &quot;from the village&quot;). The latter also demonstrates the change in the vowel of &quot;mi-&quot;. With &quot;be&quot;, &quot;le&quot; and &quot;ke&quot;, the definite article is assimilated into the prefix, which then becomes &quot;ba&quot;, &quot;la&quot; or &quot;ka&quot;. Thus *&quot;be-ha-matos&quot; becomes &quot;ba-matos&quot; (= &quot;in the plane&quot;). This does not happen to &quot;mé&quot; (the form of &quot;min&quot; or &quot;mi-&quot; used before the letter &quot;he&quot;), therefore &quot;mé-ha-matos&quot; is a valid form, which means &quot;from the airplane&quot;.

:&quot;* indicates that the given example is grammatically non-standard&quot;.

===Syntax===
Like most other languages, the vocabulary of the Hebrew language is divided into verbs, nouns, adjectives and so on, and its sentence structure can be analyzed by terms like object, subject and so on.
* Though early Biblical Hebrew had a VSO ordering, this gradually transitioned to a subject-verb-object ordering. Many Hebrew sentences have several correct orders of words.
* In Hebrew, there is no indefinite article.
* Hebrew sentences do not have to include verbs; the copula in the present tense is omitted. For example, the sentence &quot;I am here&quot; ( &#x27;) has only two words; one for I () and one for here (). In the sentence &quot;I am that person&quot; ( &#x27;), the word for &quot;am&quot; corresponds to the word for &quot;he&quot; (). However, this is usually omitted. Thus, the sentence () is more often used and means the same thing.
*Negative and interrogative sentences have the same order as the regular declarative one. A question that has a yes/no answer begins with (&quot;ha&#x27;im&quot;, an interrogative form of &#x27;if&#x27;), but it is largely omitted in informal speech.
* In Hebrew there is a specific preposition ( &#x27;) for direct objects that would not have a preposition marker in English. The English phrase &quot;he ate the cake&quot; would in Hebrew be &#x27; (literally, &quot;He ate the cake&quot;). The word , however, can be omitted, making &quot;&quot; (&quot;He ate the cake&quot;). Former Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion was convinced that should never be used as it elongates the sentence without adding meaning.
* In spoken Hebrew ‏‏ is also often contracted to ‏‏ , e.g. instead of (the &#x27; indicates non-standard use). This phenomenon has also been found by researchers in the Bar Kokhba documents: , writing instead of , as well as and so on.

==Writing system==

Users of the language write Modern Hebrew from right to left using the Hebrew alphabet – an &quot;impure&quot; abjad, or consonant-only script, of 22 letters. The ancient Paleo-Hebrew alphabet resembles those used for Canaanite and Phoenician. Modern scripts derive from the &quot;square&quot; letter form, known as &quot;Ashurit&quot; (Assyrian), which developed from the Aramaic script. A cursive Hebrew script is used in handwriting: the letters tend to appear more circular in form when written in cursive, and sometimes vary markedly from their printed equivalents. The medieval version of the cursive script forms the basis of another style, known as Rashi script. When necessary, vowels are indicated by diacritic marks above or below the letter representing the syllabic onset, or by use of &quot;matres lectionis&quot;, which are consonantal letters used as vowels. Further diacritics may serve to indicate variations in the pronunciation of the consonants (e.g. &quot;bet&quot;/&quot;vet&quot;, &quot;shin&quot;/&quot;sin&quot;); and, in some contexts, to indicate the punctuation, accentuation and musical rendition of Biblical texts (see Hebrew cantillation).

==Liturgical use in Judaism==
Hebrew has always been used as the language of prayer and study, and the following pronunciation systems are found.

Ashkenazi Hebrew, originating in Central and Eastern Europe, is still widely used in Ashkenazi Jewish religious services and studies in Israel and abroad, particularly in the Haredi and other Orthodox communities. It was influenced by Yiddish pronunciation.

Sephardi Hebrew is the traditional pronunciation of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews and Sephardi Jews in the countries of the former Ottoman Empire, with the exception of Yemenite Hebrew. This pronunciation, in the form used by the Jerusalem Sephardic community, is the basis of the Hebrew phonology of Israeli native speakers. It was influenced by Ladino pronunciation.

Mizrahi (Oriental) Hebrew is actually a collection of dialects spoken liturgically by Jews in various parts of the Arab and Islamic world. It was derived from the old Arabic language, and in some cases influenced by Sephardi Hebrew. Yemenite Hebrew or &quot;Temanit&quot; differs from other Mizrahi dialects by having a radically different vowel system, and distinguishing between different diacritically marked consonants that are pronounced identically in other dialects (for example gimel and &quot;ghimel&quot;.)

These pronunciations are still used in synagogue ritual and religious study in Israel and elsewhere, mostly by people who are not native speakers of Hebrew. However, some traditionalist Israelis use liturgical pronunciations in prayer.

Many synagogues in the diaspora, even though Ashkenazi by rite and by ethnic composition, have adopted the &quot;Sephardic&quot; pronunciation in deference to Israeli Hebrew. However, in many British and American schools and synagogues, this pronunciation retains several elements of its Ashkenazi substrate, especially the distinction between tsere and segol.

<text>Horror is a film genre that seeks to elicit physical or psychological fear in its viewers. Horror films often explore dark subject matter and may deal with transgressive topics or themes. Broad elements include monsters, apocalyptic events, and religious or folk beliefs.

Horror films have existed for more than a century. Early inspirations from before the development of film include folklore, religious beliefs and superstitions of different cultures, and the Gothic and horror literature of authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley. From origins in silent films and German Expressionism, horror only became a codified genre after the release of &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931). Many sub-genres emerged in subsequent decades, including body horror, comedy horror, erotic horror, slasher films, splatter films, supernatural horror, and psychological horror. The genre has been produced worldwide, varying in content and style between regions. Horror is particularly prominent in the cinema of Japan, Korea, and Thailand, among other countries.

Despite being the subject of social and legal controversy due to their subject matter, some horror films and franchises have seen major commercial success, influenced society and spawned several popular culture icons.

&quot;The Dictionary of Film Studies&quot; defines the horror film as representing “disturbing and dark subject matter, seeking to elicit responses of fear, terror, disgust, shock, suspense, and, of course, horror from their viewers.” In the chapter The American Nightmare: Horror in the 70s from &quot;Hollywood from Vietnam to Reagan&quot; (2002), film critic Robin Wood declared that the commonality between horror films is that “normality is threatened by the monster.” This was further expanded upon by &quot;The Philosophy of Horror, or Parodoxes of the Heart&quot; by Noël Carroll who added that “repulsion must be pleasurable, as evidenced by the genre&#x27;s popularity.”

Prior to the release of &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931), historian Gary D. Rhodes explained that the idea and terminology of horror film did not exist yet as a codified genre, although critics used the term “horror” to describe films in reviews prior to &quot;Dracula&quot;″s release. “Horror” was a term used to describe a variety of meanings. In 1913, &quot;Moving Picture World&quot; defined “horrors” as showcasing “striped convicts, murderous Indians, grinning &#x27;black-handers&#x27;, homicidal drunkards” Some titles that suggest horror such as &quot;The Hand of Horror&quot; (1914) was a melodrama about a thief who steals from his own sister. During the silent era, the term horror was used to describe everything from “battle scenes” in war films to tales of drug addiction. Rhodes concluded that the term “horror film” or “horror movie” was not used in early cinema.

The mystery film genre was in vogue and early information on &quot;Dracula&quot; being promoted as a mystery film was common, despite the novel, play and the film&#x27;s story relying on the supernatural. Newman discussed the genre in British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Companion to Horror&quot; where he noted that Horror films in the 1930s were easy to identify, but following that decade, “the more blurred distinctions become, and horror becomes less like a discrete genre than an effect which can be deployed within any number of narrative settings or narrative patterns”. In the 1940s, the horror film was viewed in different terms. Critic Siegfried Kracauer included &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; among films described as “terror films” along with &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot;, &quot;The Dark Corner&quot; (1946), &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1944), &quot;Shock&quot; (1946), &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot; (1946), &quot;The Stranger&quot; (1946) &quot;Spellbound&quot; (1945) while two years earlier, the &quot;New York Times&quot; described a new cycle of “horror” productions included &quot;Gaslight&quot;, &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot; (1944), &quot;Dark Waters&quot; (1944), &quot;Laura&quot; and &quot;Phantom Lady&quot; (1944). Mark Jancovich wrote in &quot;The Shifting Definitions of Genre: Essays on Labeling Films, Television Shows and Media&quot; (2008) that the term was virtually synonymous with mystery as a generic term, not being limited to films concerned with the strange, eerie and uncanny.

Various writings on genre from Altman, Lawrence Alloway (&quot;Violent America: The Movies 1946-1964&quot; (1971)) and Peter Hutchings (&quot;Approaches to Popular Film&quot; (1995)) implied it is easier to view films as cycles opposed to genres, suggesting the slasher film viewed as a cycle would place it in terms of how the film industry was economically and production wise, the personnel involved in their respective eras, and how the films were marketed exhibited and distributed.
Mark Jancovich in an essay, declared that “there is no simple &#x27;collective belief&#x27; as to what constitutes the horror genre” between both fans and critics of the genre. Jancovich found that disagreements existed from audiences who wanted to distinguish themselves. This ranged from fans of different genres who may view a film like &quot;Alien&quot; (1979) as belonging to science fiction, and horror fan bases dismissing it as being inauthentic to either genre. Further debates exist among fans of the genre with personal definitions of “true” horror films, such as fans who embrace cult figures like Freddy Kruger of the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; series, while others disassociate themselves from characters and series and focusing on genre &quot;auteur&quot; directors like Dario Argento, while others fans would deem Argento&#x27;s films as too mainstream, having preferences more underground films. Andrew Tudor wrote in &quot;Monsters and Mad Scientists: A Cultural History of the Horror Movie&quot; that “Genre is what we collectively believe it to be.”

In addition to these perspectives, Rhodes emphasizes the evolution of the horror genre through various cultural and historical contexts. He discusses the impact of socio-political factors on the genre, such as the influence of World War I and II, the Great Depression, and the Cold War, which shaped the themes and narratives of horror films. For instance, the anxieties of the post-war era manifested in horror films as fears of invasion, contamination, and the unknown, reflecting the collective psyche of the time. Rhodes also highlights the significance of technological advancements, such as the advent of sound in cinema, which revolutionized the horror genre by enhancing its ability to evoke fear and suspense through auditory effects.

Moreover, the horror genre&#x27;s flexibility and adaptability are crucial to its enduring popularity. As Rhodes notes, the genre continuously evolves, incorporating elements from other genres and responding to contemporary societal fears and anxieties. This adaptability is evident in the various sub-genres that have emerged over the years, such as psychological horror, body horror, and found footage horror, each addressing different aspects of human fear and the unknown.

Rhodes also explores the role of censorship and regulation in shaping the horror genre. The enforcement of the Hays Code in the 1930s and subsequent rating systems influenced the depiction of violence and sexuality in horror films. This regulation often pushed filmmakers to find creative ways to imply horror elements without explicit content, leading to a focus on atmosphere, suggestion, and psychological horror. The relaxation of censorship in the late 20th century allowed for more graphic and explicit horror, contributing to the emergence of sub-genres like splatter films and torture porn.

=== Cinematic techniques ===

In a study by Jacob Shelton, the many ways that audience members are manipulated through horror films was investigated in detail. Negative space is one such method that can play a part in inducing a reaction, causing one&#x27;s eyes to remotely rest on anything in the frame – a wall, or the empty black void in the shadows.

The jump scare is a horror film trope, where an abrupt change in image accompanied with a loud sound intends to surprise the viewer. This can also be subverted to create tension, where an audience may feel more unease and discomfort by anticipating a jump scare.

Mirrors are often used in horror films to create visual depth and build tension. Shelton argues mirrors have been used so frequently in horror films that audiences have been conditioned to fear them, and subverting audience expectations of a jump scare in a mirror can further build tension. Tight framing and close-ups are also commonly used; these can build tension and induce anxiety by not allowing the viewer to see beyond what is around the protagonist.

The interaction between horror films and their audiences is another significant aspect discussed by Rhodes. He notes that horror films often serve as a safe space for viewers to confront and process their fears. This cathartic experience can provide psychological relief and a sense of empowerment as viewers face and overcome their anxieties in a controlled environment. The communal experience of watching horror films in theaters or discussing them in fan communities also plays a crucial role in the genre&#x27;s impact and popularity.[6]

=== Music ===
Music is a key component of horror films. In &quot;Music in the Horror Film&quot; (2010), Lerner writes &quot;music in horror film frequently makes us feel threatened and uncomfortable&quot; and intends to intensify the atmosphere created in imagery and themes. Dissonance, atonality and experiments with timbre are typical characteristics used by composers in horror film music.

=== Themes ===
In the book &quot;Dark Dreams&quot;, author Charles Derry conceived horror films as focusing on three broad themes: the horror of personality, horror of Armageddon and the horror of the demonic. The horror of personality derives from monsters being at the centre of the plot, such Frankenstein&#x27;s monster whose psychology makes them perform unspeakable horrific acts ranging from rapes, mutilations and killings. Other key works of this form are Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho,&quot; which feature psychotic murderers without the make-up of a monster. The second &#x27;Armageddon&#x27; group delves on the fear of large-scale destruction, which ranges from science fiction works but also of natural events, such as Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963). The last group of the “Fear of the Demonic” features graphic accounts of satanic rites, witchcraft, exorcisms outside traditional forms of worship, as seen in films like &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973) or &quot;The Omen&quot; (1976).

Some critics have suggested horror films can be a vessel for exploring contemporary cultural, political and social trends. Jeanne Hall, a film theorist, agrees with the use of horror films in easing the process of understanding issues by making use of their optical elements. The use of horror films can help audiences understand international prior historical events occurs, for example, to depict the horrors of the Vietnam War, the Holocaust, the worldwide AIDS epidemic or post-9/11 pessimism. In many occurrences, the manipulation of horror presents cultural definitions that are not accurate, yet set an example to which a person relates to that specific cultural from then on in their life.

== History ==
==Sub-genres of horror films==
Horror is a malleable genre and often can be altered to accommodate other genre types such as science fiction, making some films difficult to categorize.

===Lovecraftian horror===

Named after American author H. P. Lovecraft (1890–1937), this sub-genre of horror films include themes of cosmic dread, forbidden and dangerous knowledge, madness, non-human influences on humanity, religion and superstition, fate and inevitability, and the risks associated with scientific discoveries.

===Body horror===

A genre that emerged in the 1970s, body horror films focus on the process of a bodily transformation. In these films, the body is either engulfed by some larger process or heading towards fragmentation and collapse. The focus can be on apocalyptic implication of an entire society being overtaken, but the focus is generally upon an individual and their sense of identity, primarily them watching their own body change. The earliest appearance of the sub-genre was the work of director David Cronenberg, specifically with early films like &quot;Shivers&quot; (1975). Mark Jancovich of the University of Manchester declared that the transformation scenes in the genre provoke fear and repulsion, but also pleasure and excitement such as in &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Fly&quot; (1986).

=== Christmas horror ===

Christmas horror is a film subgenre that emerged in the 1970s with films such as &quot;Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?&quot; (1971) and &quot;Silent Night, Bloody Night&quot; (1972), which were soon followed by the influential &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (1974). Defining the Christmas horror genre has been described as challenging, as it has generally been regarded as a sub-genre of the slasher film. Adam Rockoff, in &quot;Rue Morgue&quot;, noted that the sub-genre sits within a trend of holiday-themed slasher films, alongside films such as &quot;My Bloody Valentine&quot; (1981) and &quot;April Fool&#x27;s Day&quot; (1986). Others take a broader view that Christmas horror is not limited to the slasher genre, noting how it evolved from the English Christmas tradition of telling ghost stories. Christmas in literature has historically included elements of &quot;darkness&quot;—fright, misery, death and decay—tracing its literary antecedents as far back as the biblical account of the Massacre of the Innocents and more recently in works such as E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker and the Mouse King&quot; (1816) and Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1843). Although ghosts have largely been replaced by serial killers, Christmas horror creates an outlet through which to explore &quot;a modern reinvention of the Christmas ghost story&quot;.

=== Erotic horror ===

Erotic horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that blends sensual and sexual imagery with horrific themes for the sake of sexual arousal. Erotic horror has had influences on French and American horror cinema. The works of Jean Rollin, such as &quot;Le Viol du Vampire&quot; and &quot;Fascination&quot;, are considered quintessential erotic horror films, blending deeply sexual imagery with gore. American cinema has also featured notable erotic horror film franchises, such as &quot;Candyman.&quot; An example of a British erotic horror film series is &quot;Hellraiser&quot;. &quot;Alien&quot; features heavy erotic imagery, with the design of the Xenomorph by H. R. Giger featuring both phallic and vaginal imagery, intended to symbolize patriarchal guilt as well as sex, rape, and pregnancy.

=== Folk horror ===

Folk horror uses elements of folklore or other religious and cultural beliefs to instil fear in audiences. Folk horror films have featured rural settings and themes of isolation, religion and nature. Frequently cited examples are &quot;Witchfinder General&quot; (1968), &quot;The Blood on Satan&#x27;s Claw&quot; (1971), &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (1973), &quot;The Witch&quot; (2015), and &quot;Midsommar&quot; (2019). Local folklore and beliefs have been noted as being prevalent in horror films from the Southeast Asia region, including Thailand and Indonesia.

===Found footage horror===

The found footage horror film &quot;technique&quot; gives the audience a first person view of the events on screen, and presents the footage as being discovered after. Horror films which are framed as being made up of &quot;found-footage&quot; merge the experiences of the audience and characters, which may induce suspense, shock, and bafflement. Alexandra Heller-Nicholas noted that the popularity of sites like YouTube in 2006 sparked a taste for amateur media, leading to the production of further films in the found footage horror genre later in the 2000s including the particularly financially successful &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot; (2007).

===Gothic horror===

In their book &quot;Gothic film&quot;, Richard J. McRoy and Richard J. Hand stated that &quot;Gothic&quot; can be argued as a very loose subgenre of horror, but argued that &quot;Gothic&quot; as a whole was a style like &quot;film noir&quot; and not bound to certain cinematic elements like the Western or science fiction film. The term &quot;gothic&quot; is frequently used to describe a stylized approach to showcasing location, desire, and action in film. Contemporary views of the genre associate it with imagery of castles at hilltops and labyrinth like ancestral mansions that are in various states of disrepair. Narratives in these films often focus on an audience&#x27;s fear and attraction to social change and rebellion. The genre can be applied to films as early as &quot;The Haunted Castle&quot; (1896), &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1910) as well as to more complex iterations such as Park Chan-wook&#x27;s &quot;Stoker&quot; (2013) and Jordan Peele&#x27;s &quot;Get Out&quot; (2017).

The gothic style is applied to several films throughout the history of the horror film. This includes Universal Pictures&#x27; horror films of the 1930s, the revival of gothic horror in the 1950s and 1960s with films from Hammer, Roger Corman&#x27;s Poe-cycle, and several Italian productions. By the 1970s American and British productions often had vampire films set in a contemporary setting, such as Hammer Films had their &quot;Dracula&quot; stories set in a modern setting and made other horror material which pushed the erotic content of their vampire films that was initiated by &quot;Black Sunday&quot;. In the 1980s, the older horror characters of Dracula and Frankenstein&#x27;s monster rarely appeared, with vampire themed films continued often in the tradition of authors like Anne Rice where vampirism becomes a lifestyle choice rather than plague or curse. Following the release of Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992), a small wave of high-budgeted gothic horror romance films were released in the 1990s.

===Natural horror===

Also described as &quot;eco-horror&quot;, the natural horror film is a subgenre &quot;featuring nature running amok in the form of mutated beasts, carnivorous insects, and normally harmless animals or plants turned into cold-blooded killers.&quot; In 1963, Alfred Hitchcock defined a new genre nature taking revenge on humanity with &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963) that was expanded into a trend into the 1970s. Following the success of &quot;Willard&quot; (1971), a film about killer rats, 1972 had similar films with &quot;Stanley&quot; (1972) and an official sequel &quot;Ben&quot; (1972). Other films followed in suit such as &quot;Night of the Lepus&quot; (1972), &quot;Frogs&quot; (1972), &quot;Bug&quot; (1975), &quot;Squirm&quot; (1976) and what Muir described as the &quot;turning point&quot; in the genre with &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975), which became the highest-grossing film at that point and moved the animal attacks genres &quot;towards a less-fantastic route&quot; with less giant animals and more real-life creatures such as &quot;Grizzly&quot; (1976) and &quot;Night Creature&quot; (1977), &quot;Orca&quot; (1977), and &quot;Jaws 2&quot; (1978). The film is linked with the environmental movements that became more mainstream in the 1970s and early 1980s such vegetarianism, animal rights movements, and organizations such as Greenpeace. Following &quot;Jaws&quot;, sharks became the most popular animal of the genre, ranging from similar such as &quot;&quot; (1976) and &quot;Great White&quot; (1981) to the &quot;Sharknado&quot; film series. James Marriott found that the genre had &quot;lost momentum&quot; since the 1970s while the films would still be made towards the turn of the millennium.

=== Psychological horror ===
Bill Gibron of PopMatters declared a mixed definition of the psychological horror film, ranging from definitions of anything that created a sense of disquiet or apprehension to a film where an audience&#x27;s mind makes up what was not directly displayed visually. Gibron concluded it as a &quot;clouded gray area between all out splatter and a trip through a cinematic dark ride.&quot;

=== Religious horror ===

Religious horror is a subgenre of horror film whose common themes are based on religion and focus heavily on supernatural beings, often with demons as the main antagonists that bring a sense of threat. Such films commonly use religious elements, including the crucifix or cross, holy water, the Bible, the rosary, the sign of the cross, the church, and prayer, which are forms of religious symbols and rituals used to depict the use of faith to defeat evil.

=== Slasher film ===

The slasher film is a horror subgenre which involves a killer murdering a group of people (often teenagers), usually by use of bladed tools. In his book on the genre, author Adam Rockoff wrote that these villains represented a &quot;rogue genre&quot; of films that are &quot;tough, problematic, and fiercely individualistic.&quot; Following the financial success of &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (1980), at least 20 other slasher films appeared in 1980 alone. These films usually revolved around three properties: unique social settings (campgrounds, schools, holidays) and a crime from the past committed (an accidental drowning, infidelity, a scorned lover) and a ready made group of victims (camp counselors, students, wedding parties). The genre was derided by several contemporary film critics of the era such as Ebert, and often were highly profitable in the box office. The release of &quot;Scream&quot; (1996), led to a brief revival of the slasher films for the 1990s. Other countries imitated the American slasher film revival, such as South Korea&#x27;s early 2000s cycle with &quot;Bloody Beach&quot; (2000), &quot;Nightmare&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Record&quot; (2000).

===Splatter film===

Splatter is a subgenre that depends on violence and gore to display and accentuate a fascination with the theatricality of mutilation and the vulnerability of the human body.

===Supernatural horror===

Supernatural horror films integrate supernatural elements, such as the afterlife, spirit possession and religion into the horror genre.

=== Teen horror ===
Teen horror is a horror subgenre that victimizes teenagers while usually promoting strong, anti-conformity teenage leads, appealing to young generations. This subgenre often depicts themes of sex, under-aged drinking, and gore. Horror films aimed a young audience featuring teenage monsters grew popular in the 1950s with several productions from American International Pictures (AIP) and productions of Herman Cohen with &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot; (1957) and &quot;I Was a Teenage Frankenstein&quot; (1957). This led to later productions like &quot;Daughter of Dr. Jekyll&quot; (1957) and &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1958). Teen horror cycle in the 1980s often showcased explicit gore and nudity, with John Kenneth Muir described as cautionary conservative tales where most of the films stated if you partook in such vices such as drugs or sex, your punishment of death would be handed out.
Prior to &quot;Scream&quot;, there were no popular teen horror films in the early 1990s. After the financial success of &quot;Scream&quot;, teen horror films became increasingly reflexive and self-aware until the end of the 1990s with films like &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1997) and non-slasher &quot;The Faculty&quot; (1998). The genre lost prominence as teen films dealt with threats with more realism in films like &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; (2001) and &quot;Crazy/Beautiful&quot; (2001). In her book on the 1990s teen horror cycle, Alexandra West described the general trend of these films is often looked down upon by critics, journals, and fans as being too glossy, trendy, and sleek to be considered worthwhile horror films.

== Regional horror films ==
===Asian horror films===

Horror films in Asia have been noted as being inspired by national, cultural or religious folklore, particularly beliefs in ghosts or spirits. In &quot;Asian Horror&quot;, Andy Richards writes that there is a &quot;widespread and engrained acceptance of supernatural forces&quot; in many Asian cultures, and suggests this is related to animist, pantheist and karmic religious traditions, as in Buddhism and Shintoism. Although Chinese, Japanese, Thai and Korean horror has arguably received the most international attention, horror also makes up a considerable proportion of Cambodian and Malaysian cinema.

===European horror films===

Ian Olney described the horror films of Europe were often more erotic and &quot;just plain stranger&quot; than their British and American counter-parts. European horror films (generally referred to as Euro Horror) draw from distinctly European cultural sources, including surrealism, romanticism, decadent tradition, early 20th century pulp-literature, film serials, and erotic comics. In comparison to the narrative logic in American genre films, these films focused on imagery, excessiveness, and the irrational.

Between the mid-1950s and the mid-1980s, European horror films emerged from countries like Italy, Spain and France, and were shown in the United States predominantly at drive-in theatre and grindhouse theaters. As producers and distributors all over the world were interested in horror films, regardless of their origin, changes started occurring in European low-budget filmmaking that allowed for productions in the 1960s and 1970s for horror films from Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain, as well as co-productions between these countries. Several productions, such as those in Italy, were co-productions due to the lack of international stars within the country. European horror films began developing strong cult following since the late 1990s.

===Oceania===
==== Australia ====
It is unknown when Australia&#x27;s cinema first horror title may have been, with thoughts ranging from &quot;The Strangler&#x27;s Grip&quot; (1912) to &quot;The Face at the Window&quot; (1919) while stories featuring ghosts would appear in &quot;Guyra Ghost Mystery&quot; (1921). By 1913, the more prolific era of Australian cinema ended with production not returning with heavy input of government finance in the 1970s. It took until the 1970s for Australia to develop sound film with television films that eventually received theatrical release with &quot;Dead Easy&quot; (1970) and &quot;Night of Fear&quot; (1973). &quot;The Cars That Ate Paris&quot; (1974) was the first Australian horror production made for theatrical release. 1970s Australian art cinema was funded by state film corporations, who considered them more culturally acceptable than local exploitation films (Ozploitation), which was part of the Australian phenomenon called the cultural cringe. The greater success of genre films like &quot;Mad Max&quot; (1979), &quot;The Last Wave&quot; (1977) and &quot;Patrick&quot; (1978) led to the Australian Film Commission to change its focus to being a more commercial operation. This closed in 1980 as its funding was abused by investors using them as tax avoiding measures. A new development known as the 10BA tax shelter scheme was developed ushering a slew of productions, leading to what Peter Shelley, author of &quot;Australian Horror Films&quot;, suggested meant &quot;making a profit was more important than making a good film.&quot; Shelley called these films derivative of &quot;American films and presenting generic American material&quot;. These films included the horror film productions of Antony I. Ginnane. While Australia would have success with international films between the mid-1980s and the 2000s, less than five horror films were produced in the country between 1993 and 2000. It was only after the success of &quot;Wolf Creek&quot; (2005) that a new generation of filmmakers would continuously make horror genre films in Australia that continued into the 2010s.

==== New Zealand ====
By 2005, New Zealand has produced around 190 feature films, with about 88% of them being made after 1976. New Zealand horror film history was described by Philip Matthews of Stuff as making &quot;po-faced gothic and now we do horror for laughs.&quot; Among the earliest known New Zealand horror films productions are &quot;Strange Behavior&quot; (1981), a co-production with Australia and &quot;Death Warmed Up&quot; (1984) a single production. Early features such as Melanie Read&#x27;s &quot;Trial Run&quot; (1984) where a mother is sent to remote cottage to photograph penguins and finds it habitat to haunted spirits, and Gaylene Preston&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Wrong&quot; (1984) purchases a car that is haunted by its previous owner. Other films imitate American slasher and splatter films with &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; (1986), and the early films of Peter Jackson who combined splatter films with comedy with &quot;Bad Taste&quot; (1988) and &quot;Braindead&quot; (1992) which has the largest following of the mentioned films. Film producer Ant Timpson had an influence curating New Zealand horror films, creating the Incredibly Strange Film Festival in the 1990s and producing his own horror films over the 2010s including &quot;The ABCs of Death&quot; (2012), &quot;Deathgasm&quot; (2015), and &quot;Housebound&quot; (2014). Timpson noted the latter horror entries from New Zealand are all humorous films like &quot;What We Do in the Shadows&quot; (2014) with Jonathan King, director of &quot;Black Sheep&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Tattooist&quot; (2007) stating &quot;I&#x27;d love to see a genuinely scary New Zealand film but I don&#x27;t know if New Zealand audiences – or the funding bodies – are keen.&quot;

=== North America ===
==== Mexico ====

After the 1931 release of a American-produced Spanish-language version of &quot;Dracula&quot; by George Melford for the Latin-American market employing Mexican actors, Mexican horror films were produced throughout the 1930s and 1940s, often reflecting on the overarching theme of science vs. religion conflict. Ushered by the release of &quot;El vampiro&quot;, the Mexploitation horror film era started in 1957, with films characterised by their low production values and camp appeal, often featuring vampires, wrestlers, and Aztec mummies. A key figure in the Mexican horror scene (particularly in Germán Robles-starred vampire films) was producer Abel Salazar. The late 1960s saw the advent of the prominence of Carlos Enrique Taboada as an standout Mexican horror filmmaker, with films such as &quot;Hasta el viento tiene miedo&quot; (1967), &quot;El libro de piedra&quot; (1968), &quot;Más negro que la noche&quot; (1975) or &quot;Veneno para las hadas&quot; (1984). Mexican horror cinema has been noted for the mashup of classic gothic and romantic themes and characters with autochthonous features of the Mexican culture such as the Ranchería setting, the colonial past or the myth of La Llorona (shared with other Hispanic-American nations).

Horror has proven to be a dependable genre at the Mexican box office in the 21st-century, with Mexico ranking as having the world&#x27;s largest relative popularity of the genre among viewers (ahead of South Korea), according to a 2016 research.

==Effects on audiences==
=== Psychological effects ===

In a study done by Uri Hasson et al., brain waves were observed via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This study used the inter-subject correlation analysis (ISC) method of determining results. It was shown that audience members tend to focus on certain facets in a particular scene simultaneously and tend to sit as still as possible while watching horror films.

In another study done by John Greene &amp; Glenn Sparks, it was found that the audience tends to experience the excitation transfer process (ETP) which causes a physiological arousal in audience members. The ETP refers to the feelings experienced immediately after an emotion-arousing experience, such as watching a horror film. In this case, audience members&#x27; heart rate, blood pressure and respiration all increased while watching films with violence. Audience members with positive feedback regarding the horror film have feelings similar to happiness or joy felt with friends, but intensified. Alternatively, audience members with negative feedback regarding the film would typically feel emotions they would normally associate with negative experiences in their life.

Only about 10% of the American population enjoy the physiological rush felt immediately after watching horror films. The population that does not enjoy horror films could experience emotional fallout similar to that of PTSD if the environment reminds them of particular scenes.

A 2021 study suggested horror films that explore grief can provide psychological benefits to the bereaved, with the genre well suited to representing grief through its genre conventions.

=== Physical effects ===
In a study by Medes et al., prolonged exposure to infrasound and low-frequency noise (&lt;500 Hz) in long durations has an effect on vocal range (i.e. longer exposure tends to form a lower phonation frequency range). Another study by Baliatsas et al. observed that there is a correlation between exposure to infrasound and low-frequency noises and sleep-related problems. Though most horror films keep the audio around 20–30 Hz, the noise can still be unsettling in long durations.

Another technique used in horror films to provoke a response from the audience is cognitive dissonance, which is when someone experiences tension in themselves and is urged to relieve that tension. Dissonance is the clashing of unpleasant or harsh sounds. A study by Prete et al. identified that the ability to recognize dissonance relied on the left hemisphere of the brain, while consonance relied on the right half. There is a stronger preference for consonance; this difference is noticeable even in early stages of life. Previous musical experience also can influence a dislike for dissonance.

Skin conductance responses (SCRs), heart rate (HR), and electromyographic (EMG) responses vary in response to emotional stimuli, showing higher for negative emotions in what is known as the &quot;negative bias.&quot; When applied to dissonant music, HR decreases (as a bodily form of adaptation to harsh stimulation), SCR increases, and EMG responses in the face are higher. The typical reactions go through a two-step process of first orienting to the problem (the slowing of HR), then a defensive process (a stronger increase in SCR and an increase in HR). This initial response can sometimes result in a fight-or-flight response, which is the characteristic of dissonance that horror films rely on to frighten and unsettle viewers.

== Reception ==

=== In film criticism ===

Critic Robin Wood was not the first film critic to take the horror film seriously, but his article &quot;Return of the Repressed&quot; in 1978 helped inaugurate the horror film into academic study as a genre. Wood later stated that he was surprised that his work, as well as the writing of Richard Lippe and Andrew Britton would receive &quot;historic importance&quot; intellectual views of the film genre. William Paul in his book &quot;Laughing Screaming&quot; comments that &quot;the negative definition of the lower works would have it that they are less subtle than higher genres. More positively, it could be said that they are more direct. Where lower forms are explicit, higher forms tend to operate more by indirection. Because of this indirection the higher forms are often regarded as being more metaphorical, and consequently more resonant, more open to the exegetical analyses of the academic industry.&quot;

Steffen Hantke noted that academic criticism about horror cinema had &quot;always operated under duress&quot; noting that challenges in legitimizing its subject, finding &quot;career-minded academics might have always suspected that they were studying something that was ultimately too frivolous, garish, and sensationalistic to warrant serious critical attention&quot;.

Some commentary has suggested that horror films have been underrepresented or underappreciated as serious works worthy of film criticism and major films awards. As of 2025, only seven horror films have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, with &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; being the sole winner. However, horror films have still won major awards.

Critics have also commented on the representation of women and disability in horror films, as well as the prevalence of racial stereotypes.

=== Censorship ===

Many horror films have been the subject of moral panic, censorship and legal controversy.

In the United Kingdom, film censorship has frequently been applied to horror films. A moral panic over several slasher films in the 1980s led to many of them being banned but released on videotape; the phenomenon became popularly termed &quot;video nasties&quot;. Constraints on permitted subject matter in Indonesian films has also influenced Indonesian horror films. In March 2008, China banned all horror films from its market.

In the U.S., the Motion Picture Production Code which was implemented in 1930, set moral guidelines for film content, restraining movies containing controversial themes, graphic violence, explicit sexuality and/or nudity. The gradual abandonment of the Code, and its eventual formal repeal in 1968 (when it was replaced by the MPAA film rating system) offered more freedom to the movie industry.

<text>House of Pain was an American hip hop trio that released three albums in the 1990s. The group consisted of DJ Lethal, Danny Boy, and Everlast. They are best known for their 1992 hit single &quot;Jump Around&quot;, which reached number 3 in their native United States of America, number 6 in Ireland and number 8 in the United Kingdom. The group broke up in 1996.

Lead rapper Everlast went on to pursue a solo career as a blues rock artist and member of the supergroup La Coka Nostra which also featured DJ Lethal. DJ Lethal would later join and find commercial success with the rap rock band Limp Bizkit. House of Pain reunited briefly in 2010 for a world tour.

The group&#x27;s name is a reference to the H.G. Wells novel &quot;The Island of Dr Moreau&quot;, a reference carried further by the naming of their 2011 tour &quot;He Who Breaks the Law&quot;; however, they initially became aware of the phrase via the Oingo Boingo song &quot;No Spill Blood&quot;, of which they were fans.

==Band history==
===1990–1992: Formation and breakthrough===
In 1990, Daniel O&#x27;Connor (Danny Boy O&#x27;Connor) got together with fellow rapper Erik Schrody (Everlast) who had just released a rap album called &quot;Forever Everlasting&quot; (1990), that did not have much success. O&#x27;Connor knew Schrody when he went to William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills, California (1984–1986), and various hip hop events they attended in their teens. Both of Irish American descent, they decided to make a hip hop group with this identity. While hanging out at O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s home, Schrody noticed a cassette with the title &quot;House of Pain&quot;, which was a demo of a Punk group O&#x27;Connor tried to put together. Schrody really liked the name and felt they should re-use as their name. Schrody brought in his former DJ Leor Dimant (DJ Lethal), who is of Latvian descent, and House of Pain was created. Schrody would become the lead rapper, while O&#x27;Connor acted as the hype man, second emcee, art director and the graphic artist of the group. After they recorded a demo, for which O&#x27;Connor designed the cover, that created a bidding war among labels. The label they chose was Tommy Boy Records, who credited O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s art work with having initially caught their attention.

In 1992, they released their debut album &quot;House of Pain&quot;, subtitled &quot;Fine Malt Lyrics.&quot; Their first single &quot;Jump Around&quot; was a major hit. In the United States, it peaked at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while reaching number 5 on the Hot Rap Songs, 13 on Rhythmic Top 40, 1 on Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales, number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs, and is certified platinum. The song was produced by Lawrence Muggerud (DJ Muggs) and performed by Schrody. Both Muggerud and Schrody knew each other since Rhyme Syndicate. Muggerud who had a beat he had submitted to various artist, eventually invited Schrody to give it a try. Schrody wrote lyrics in his driveway and being influenced by dance hall singer Shabba Ranks part of the lyrics were &quot;Jump around, if you love freedom. Jump around, if you love culture&quot;, which Muggerud suggested they trim down to &quot;Jump Around&quot;. While re-working his lyrics, Muggerud came up with the iconic horn that accompany the song. Their second single &quot;Shamrocks and Shenanigans (Boom Shalock Lock Boom)&quot; peaked at 65 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, 75 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, 14 on the Dance Club Songs, and 74 on Radio Songs. The album peaked at 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, 14 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Current Albums, 16 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, 14 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Album Sales, and is certified platinum.

=== 1993–1996: Subsequent success and group&#x27;s breakup ===
In 1993, they were among the rap artists who had cameo roles in Ted Demme&#x27;s film &quot;Who&#x27;s the Man?&quot;. For this project they provided a theme song by the same name, which was also used as a single for the soundtrack and their subsequent album. It rose to number 97 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, 77 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks, and 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales. Also that year, they participated together with Helmet, along with several other rap acts, on the 1993 rap rock collaborative &quot;Judgment Night&quot; film soundtrack.

In 1994, they released &quot;Same as It Ever Was&quot;. The album peaked at 12 equally on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Current Albums, the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Album Sales, and is certified gold. &quot;AllMusic&quot; gave it four out five stars. Matt Carlson of &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot; found the album quite good and noted &quot;the music is laid back with some heavy driving forces underlying and strengthening it&quot;. J.D. Constantine of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; did not like album and found it monotonous and unimaginative. Roger Catlin of the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; said that while finding the continuity monotonous it&#x27;s &quot;hard and compelling&quot; as well as a &quot;strong outing&quot;. Andrew Love of &quot;The Ocala Star-Banner&quot; gave it four stars saying &quot;this is a band that has definitely progressed over the course of one album&quot;. Music critic Robert Christgau, who did not like their previous and subsequent album, gave it an A− and described it as &quot;the hardest hip hop of the year&quot;.

In 1996, they released &quot;Truth Crushed to Earth Shall Rise Again&quot;. The album peaked at 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, 47 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Current Albums, 31 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, and 47 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Album Sales. At the release party, Schrody decided to disband the group. Sputnikmusic wrote that &quot;the trio’s most rounded, consistent &amp; memorable LP is grossly under-appreciated.&quot; Dave Ferman of the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; gave it one star and a half, calling it a &quot;woeful mess&quot;. Steve Juon of &quot;RapReviews&quot; gave it a seven out of ten. &quot;AllMusic&quot; music gave it two point five stars out of five.

=== 1997–present day: solo projects and reunions ===
From then on, the members continued their separate careers. Schrody achieved multi-platinum solo fame in 1998 with his album &quot;Whitey Ford Sings the Blues,&quot; where he developed a style that blended rap with acoustic guitar, as well as singing.

Dimant became the DJ of multi-platinum nu metal band Limp Bizkit.

O&#x27;Connor, did some freelance work designing clothes, and was involved in several music projects.

In late 2004, the creation of the rap supergroup La Coka Nostra started when O&#x27;Connor was mentoring young artists. He took notice of two up and comers which included George Carroll (Slaine) and brought them to meet his former DJ from House of Pain, Leor Dimant, who at the time was working on a compilation album and championing a new artist as well. They decided to make a group and asked O&#x27;Connor to become a member as a hype man and art director. After accepting, O&#x27;Connor felt that there was a void and asked experienced rapper William Braunstein (Ill Bill) to join. The group&#x27;s name came about, when O&#x27;Connor teased Carroll and Braunstein with that nickname, after they both had a night out. The group started releasing music on MySpace, and went viral. Eventually, O&#x27;Connor received a letter from former House of Pain colleague Erik Schrody, who asked if he could join. By 2006, the group consisted of O&#x27;Connor, Carroll, Dimant, Braunstein, and Schrody.

In 2009, La Coka Nostra released &quot;A Brand You Can Trust&quot; was released on July 14, 2009, on Suburban Noize Records. It sold over 500,000 units. &quot;AllMusic&quot; gave four out of five stars. Andrew Kameka of &quot;HipHopDX&quot; wrote that &quot;the album is a mostly solid effort and exactly what someone would expect from a supergroup of like-minded members known for high-energy music&quot;. Adam Kennedy of the &quot;BBC&quot; while praising some the moments of the album said &quot;it’s a tantalising parting taste of potential capabilities, yet until they improve a customer satisfaction hit rate that barely troubles one in three tunes here&quot;. Steve Juon of &quot;RapReviews&quot; gave it a seven out of ten. &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; described it as &quot;a disjointed effort, but still pretty decent in and of itself and gave it three point five out of five. Thomas Quinlan of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; said &quot;La Coka Nostra are an interesting collection of collaborators that live up to the hype&quot;.

On March 2, 2012, it was announced that Schrody would be leaving La Coka Nostra due to his daughter&#x27;s medical issues, while O&#x27;Connor and Dimant pursued two more project with the group &quot;Masters of the Dark Arts&quot; (2012) and &quot;To Thine Own Self Be True&quot; (2016).

House of Pain reunited at a private event held by UFC president Dana White in Boston on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day 2009. It was officially announced on August 10, 2010, that House of Pain had reunited and performed their first &quot;official&quot; show in a decade at the second annual Epicenter music festival in Fontana, California, on September 25, 2010. Though Dimant is still a member of the group, he did not join them on their 2011 reunion tour due to prior obligations with Limp Bizkit. In April–May 2011 House of Pain attended the Groovin&#x27; the Moo touring festival in Australia, and also performed at Scotland&#x27;s T in the Park festival on July 9, 2011, as well as Sonisphere UK Festival on July 12 of the same year.

House of Pain reunited in 2017 for a 25th Anniversary Tour. The tour included shows in DC, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, and California.

Between reunions and projects together, Schrody continues with his solo career, while Dimant still works with Limp Bizkit, and in 2019 O&#x27;Connor opened The Outsiders House Museum dedicated to both the novel and the film &quot;The Outsiders&quot;.

<doc id="13456" wikidata="Q48352" url="?curid=13456" title="Head of state">
<text>A head of state is the public persona of a sovereign state. The name given to the office of head of state depends on the country&#x27;s form of government and any separation of powers; the powers of the office in each country range from being also the head of government to being little more than a ceremonial figurehead.

In a parliamentary system, such as India or the United Kingdom, the head of state usually has mostly ceremonial powers, with a separate head of government. However, in some parliamentary systems, like South Africa, there is an executive president that is both head of state and head of government. Likewise, in some parliamentary systems the head of state is not the head of government, but still has significant powers, for example Morocco. In contrast, a semi-presidential system, such as France, has both heads of state and government as the &quot;de facto&quot; leaders of the nation (in practice they divide the leadership of the nation between themselves). 

Meanwhile, in presidential systems, the head of state is also the head of government. In one-party ruling communist states, the position of president has no tangible powers by itself; however, since such a head of state, as a matter of custom, simultaneously holds the post of General Secretary of the Communist Party, they are the executive leader with their powers deriving from their status of being the party leader, rather than the office of president.

Former French president Charles de Gaulle, while developing the current Constitution of France (1958), said that the head of state should embody &quot;&quot; (&quot;the spirit of the nation&quot;).

==Constitutional models==

Some academic writers discuss states and governments in terms of &quot;models&quot;.

An independent nation state normally has a head of state, and determines the extent of its head&#x27;s executive powers of government or formal representational functions. In terms of protocol: the head of a sovereign, independent state is usually identified as the person who, according to that state&#x27;s constitution, is the reigning monarch, in the case of a monarchy; or the president, in the case of a republic.

Among the state constitutions (fundamental laws) that establish different political systems, four major types of heads of state can be distinguished:

# The parliamentary system, with two subset models;
## The &quot;standard model&quot;, in which the head of state, in theory, possesses key executive powers, but such power is exercised on the binding advice of a head of government (e.g. United Kingdom, India, Germany).
## The &quot;non-executive model&quot;, in which the head of state has either none or very limited executive powers, and mainly has a ceremonial and symbolic role (e.g. Sweden, Japan, Israel).
# The semi-presidential system, in which the head of state shares key executive powers with a head of government or cabinet (e.g. Russia, France, Sri Lanka); and
# The presidential system, in which the head of state is also the head of government and has all executive powers (e.g. United States, Indonesia, South Korea).

In a federal constituent or a dependent territory, the same role is fulfilled by the holder of an office corresponding to that of a head of state. For example, in each Canadian province the role is fulfilled by the lieutenant governor, whereas in most British Overseas Territories the powers and duties are performed by the governor. The same applies to Australian states, Indian states, etc. Hong Kong&#x27;s constitutional document, the Basic Law, for example, specifies the chief executive as the head of the special administrative region, in addition to their role as the head of government. These non-sovereign-state heads, nevertheless, have limited or no role in diplomatic affairs, depending on the status and the norms and practices of the territories concerned.

In parliamentary systems the head of state may be merely the nominal chief executive officer, heading the executive branch of the state, and possessing limited executive power. In reality, however, following a process of constitutional evolution, powers are usually only exercised by direction of a cabinet, presided over by a head of government who is answerable to the legislature. This accountability and legitimacy requires that someone be chosen who has a majority support in the legislature (or, at least, not a majority opposition – a subtle but important difference). It also gives the legislature the right to vote down the head of government and their cabinet, forcing it either to resign or seek a parliamentary dissolution. The executive branch is thus said to be responsible (or answerable) to the legislature, with the head of government and cabinet in turn accepting constitutional responsibility for offering constitutional advice to the head of state.

In parliamentary constitutional monarchies, the legitimacy of the unelected head of state typically derives from the tacit approval of the people via the elected representatives. Accordingly, at the time of the Glorious Revolution, the English parliament acted of its own authority to name a new king and queen (the joint monarchs Mary II and William III); likewise, Edward VIII&#x27;s abdication required the approval of each of the six independent realms of which he was monarch. In monarchies with a written constitution, the position of monarch is created under the constitution and could be abolished through a democratic procedure of constitutional amendment. In many cases there are significant procedural hurdles imposed on such a procedure (as in the Constitution of Spain).

In republics with a parliamentary system (such as India, Germany, Austria, Italy and Israel), the head of state is usually titled &quot;president&quot; and the principal functions of such presidents are mainly ceremonial and symbolic, as opposed to the presidents in a presidential or semi-presidential system.

In reality, numerous variants exist to the position of a head of state within a parliamentary system. The older the constitution, the more constitutional leeway tends to exist for a head of state to exercise greater powers over government, as many older parliamentary system constitutions in fact give heads of state powers and functions akin to presidential or semi-presidential systems, in some cases without containing reference to modern democratic principles of accountability to parliament or even to modern governmental offices. Usually, the king had the power of declaring war without previous consent of the parliament.

For example, under the 1848 constitution of the Kingdom of Sardinia, and then the Kingdom of Italy, the &quot;Statuto Albertino&quot;—the parliamentary approval to the government appointed by the king—was customary, but not required by law.

Examples of heads of state in parliamentary systems using greater powers than usual, either because of ambiguous constitutions or unprecedented national emergencies, include the decision by King Leopold III of the Belgians to surrender on behalf of his state to the invading German army in 1940, against the will of his government. Judging that his responsibility to the nation by virtue of his coronation oath required him to act, he believed that his government&#x27;s decision to fight rather than surrender was mistaken and would damage Belgium. (Leopold&#x27;s decision proved highly controversial. After World War II, Belgium voted in a referendum to allow him to resume his monarchical powers and duties, but because of the ongoing controversy he ultimately abdicated.) The Belgian constitutional crisis in 1990, when the head of state refused to sign into law a bill permitting abortion, was resolved by the cabinet assuming the power to promulgate the law while he was treated as &quot;unable to reign&quot; for twenty-four hours.

====Non-executive model====
These officials are excluded completely from the executive: they do not possess even theoretical executive powers or any role, even formal, within the government. Hence their states&#x27; governments are not referred to by the traditional parliamentary model head of state styles of &quot;His/Her Majesty&#x27;s Government&quot; or &quot;His/Her Excellency&#x27;s Government&quot;. Within this general category, variants in terms of powers and functions may exist.

The was drawn up under the Allied occupation that followed World War II and was intended to replace the previous militaristic and quasi-absolute monarchy system with a form of liberal democracy parliamentary system. The constitution explicitly vests all executive power in the Cabinet, who is chaired by the prime minister (articles 65 and 66) and responsible to the Diet (articles 67 and 69). The emperor is defined in the constitution as &quot;the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people&quot; (article 1), and is generally recognised throughout the world as the Japanese head of state. Although the emperor formally appoints the prime minister to office, article 6 of the constitution requires him to appoint the candidate &quot;as designated by the Diet&quot;, without any right to decline appointment. He is a ceremonial figurehead with no independent discretionary powers related to the governance of Japan.

Since the passage in Sweden of the 1974 Instrument of Government, the Swedish monarch no longer has many of the standard parliamentary system head of state functions that had previously belonged to him or her, as was the case in the preceding 1809 Instrument of Government. Today, the speaker of the Riksdag appoints (following a vote in the Riksdag) the prime minister and terminates their commission following a vote of no confidence or voluntary resignation. Cabinet members are appointed and dismissed at the sole discretion of the prime minister. Laws and ordinances are promulgated by two Cabinet members in unison signing &quot;On Behalf of the Government&quot; and the government—not the monarch—is the high contracting party with respect to international treaties. The remaining official functions of the sovereign, by constitutional mandate or by unwritten convention, are to open the annual session of the Riksdag, receive foreign ambassadors and sign the letters of credence for Swedish ambassadors, chair the foreign advisory committee, preside at the special Cabinet council when a new prime minister takes office, and to be kept informed by the prime minister on matters of state.

In contrast, the only contact the president of Ireland has with the Irish government is through a formal briefing session given by the taoiseach (head of government) to the president. However, the president has no access to documentation and all access to ministers goes through the Department of the Taoiseach. The president does, however, hold limited reserve powers, such as referring a bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality, which are used under the president&#x27;s discretion.

The most extreme non-executive republican head of state is the President of Israel, which holds no reserve powers whatsoever. The least ceremonial powers held by the president are to provide a mandate to attempt to form a government, to approve the dissolution of the Knesset made by the prime minister, and to pardon criminals or to commute their sentence.

====Executive model====

Some parliamentary republics (like South Africa, Botswana and Kiribati) have fused the roles of the head of state with the head of government (like in a presidential system), while having the sole executive officer, often called a president, being dependent on the Parliament&#x27;s confidence to rule (like in a parliamentary system). While also being the leading symbol of the nation, the president in this system acts mostly as a prime minister since the incumbent must be a member of the legislature at the time of the election, answer question sessions in Parliament, avoid motions of no confidence, etc.

===Semi-presidential systems===
Semi-presidential systems combine features of presidential and parliamentary systems, notably (in the president-parliamentary subtype) a requirement that the government be answerable to both the president and the legislature. The constitution of the Fifth French Republic provides for a prime minister who is chosen by the president, but who nevertheless must be able to gain support in the National Assembly. Should a president be of one side of the political spectrum and the opposition be in control of the legislature, the president is usually obliged to select someone from the opposition to become prime minister, a process known as Cohabitation. President François Mitterrand, a Socialist, for example, was forced to cohabit with the neo-Gaullist (right wing) Jacques Chirac, who became his prime minister from 1986 to 1988. In the French system, in the event of cohabitation, the president is often allowed to set the policy agenda in security and foreign affairs and the prime minister runs the domestic and economic agenda.

Other countries evolve into something akin to a semi-presidential system or indeed a full presidential system.The constitution of the Weimar Republic, for example, provided for a popularly elected president with theoretically dominant executive powers that were intended to be exercised only in emergencies, and a cabinet appointed by him from the Reichstag, which was expected, in normal circumstances, to be answerable to the Reichstag. Initially, the president was merely a symbolic figure with the Reichstag dominant; however, persistent political instability, in which governments often lasted only a few months, led to a change in the power structure of the republic, with the president&#x27;s emergency powers called increasingly into use to prop up governments challenged by critical or even hostile Reichstag votes. By 1932, power had shifted to such an extent that the German president, Paul von Hindenburg, was able to dismiss a chancellor and select his own person for the job, even though the outgoing chancellor possessed the confidence of the Reichstag while the new chancellor did not. Subsequently, President von Hindenburg used his power to appoint Adolf Hitler as Chancellor without consulting the Reichstag.
===Presidential system===

&quot;Note: The head of state in a &quot;presidential&quot; system may not actually hold the title of &quot;president&quot; - the name of the system refers to any head of state who actually governs and is not directly dependent on the legislature to remain in office.&quot;

Some constitutions or fundamental laws provide for a head of state who is not only in theory but in practice chief executive, operating separately from, and independent from, the legislature. This system is known as a &quot;presidential system&quot; and sometimes called the &quot;imperial model&quot;, because the executive officials of the government are answerable solely and exclusively to a presiding, acting head of state, and is selected by and on occasion dismissed by the head of state without reference to the legislature. It is notable that some presidential systems, while not providing for collective executive accountability to the legislature, may require legislative approval for individuals prior to their assumption of cabinet office and empower the legislature to remove a president from office (for example, in the United States of America). In this case the debate centers on confirming them into office, not removing them from office, and does not involve the power to reject or approve proposed cabinet members &quot;en bloc&quot;, so accountability does not operate in the same sense understood as a parliamentary system.

Presidential systems are a notable feature of constitutions in the Americas, including those of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Mexico and Venezuela; this is generally attributed to the strong influence of the United States in the region, and as the United States Constitution served as an inspiration and model for the Latin American wars of independence of the early 19th century. Most presidents in such countries are selected by democratic means (popular direct or indirect election); however, like all other systems, the presidential model also encompasses people who become head of state by other means, notably through military dictatorship or &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, as often seen in Latin American, Middle Eastern and other presidential regimes. Some of the characteristics of a presidential system, such as a strong dominant political figure with an executive answerable to them, not the legislature can also be found among absolute monarchies, parliamentary monarchies and single party (e.g., Communist) regimes, but in most cases of dictatorship, their stated constitutional models are applied in name only and not in political theory or practice.

===Single-party states===
In certain states under Marxist–Leninist constitutions of the constitutionally socialist state type inspired by the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and its constitutive Soviet republics, real political power belonged to the sole legal party. In these states, there was no formal office of head of state, but rather the leader of the legislative branch was considered to be the closest common equivalent of a head of state as a natural person. In the Soviet Union this position carried such titles as &quot;Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR&quot;; &quot;Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet&quot;; and in the case of the Soviet Russia &quot;Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets&quot; (pre-1922), and &quot;Chairman of the Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian SFSR&quot; (1956–1966). This position may or may not have been held by the de facto Soviet leader at the moment. For example, Nikita Khrushchev never headed the Supreme Soviet but was First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (party leader) and Chairman of the Council of Ministers (head of government).

This may even lead to an institutional variability, as in North Korea, where, after the presidency of party leader Kim Il Sung, the office was vacant for years. The late president was granted the posthumous title (akin to some ancient Far Eastern traditions to give posthumous names and titles to royalty) of &quot;Eternal President&quot;. All substantive power, as party leader, itself not formally created for four years, was inherited by his son Kim Jong Il. The post of president was formally replaced on 5 September 1998, for ceremonial purposes, by the office of President of the Presidium of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly, while the party leader&#x27;s post as chairman of the National Defense Commission was simultaneously declared &quot;the highest post of the state&quot;, not unlike Deng Xiaoping earlier in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In China, under the current country&#x27;s constitution, the Chinese President is a largely ceremonial office with limited power. However, since 1993, as a matter of convention, the presidency has been held simultaneously by the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, the top leader in the one party system. The presidency is officially regarded as an institution of the state rather than an administrative post; theoretically, the President serves at the pleasure of the National People&#x27;s Congress, the legislature, and is not legally vested to take executive action on its own prerogative.

===Complications with categorisation===
While clear categories do exist, it is sometimes difficult to choose which category some individual heads of state belong to. In reality, the category to which each head of state belongs is assessed not by theory but by practice.

Constitutional change in Liechtenstein in 2003 gave its head of state, the Reigning Prince, constitutional powers that included a veto over legislation and power to dismiss the head of government and cabinet. It could be argued that the strengthening of the Prince&#x27;s powers, vis-a-vis the Landtag (legislature), has moved Liechtenstein into the semi-presidential category. Similarly the original powers given to the Greek President under the 1974 Hellenic Republic constitution moved Greece closer to the French semi-presidential model.

Another complication exists with South Africa, in which the president is in fact elected by the National Assembly (legislature) and is thus similar, in principle, to a head of government in a parliamentary system but is also, in addition, recognised as the head of state. The offices of president of Nauru and president of Botswana are similar in this respect to the South African presidency.

Panama, during the military dictatorships of Omar Torrijos and Manuel Noriega, was nominally a presidential republic. However, the elected civilian presidents were effectively figureheads with real political power being exercised by the chief of the Panamanian Defense Forces.

Historically, at the time of the League of Nations (1920–1946) and the founding of the United Nations (1945), India&#x27;s head of state was the monarch of the United Kingdom, ruling directly or indirectly as Emperor of India through the Viceroy and Governor-General of India.

==Roles==
Head of state is the highest-ranking constitutional position in a sovereign state. A head of state has some or all of the roles listed below, often depending on the constitutional category (above), and does not necessarily regularly exercise the most power or influence of governance. There is usually a formal public ceremony when a person becomes head of state, or some time after. This may be the swearing in at the inauguration of a president of a republic, or the coronation of a monarch.

===Symbolic role===
One of the most important roles of the modern head of state is being a living national symbol of the state; in hereditary monarchies this extends to the monarch being a symbol of the unbroken continuity of the state. For instance, the Canadian monarch is described by the government as being the personification of the Canadian state and is described by the Department of Canadian Heritage as the &quot;personal symbol of allegiance, unity and authority for all Canadians&quot;.

In many countries, official portraits of the head of state can be found in government offices, courts of law, or other public buildings. The idea, sometimes regulated by law, is to use these portraits to make the public aware of the symbolic connection to the government, a practice that dates back to medieval times. Sometimes this practice is taken to excess, and the head of state becomes the principal symbol of the nation, resulting in the emergence of a personality cult where the image of the head of state is the only visual representation of the country, surpassing other symbols such as the flag.

Other common representations are on coins, postage and other stamps and banknotes, sometimes by no more than a mention or signature; and public places, streets, monuments and institutions such as schools are named for current or previous heads of state. In monarchies (e.g., Belgium) there can even be a practice to attribute the adjective &quot;royal&quot; on demand based on existence for a given number of years. However, such political techniques can also be used by leaders without the formal rank of head of state, even party - and other revolutionary leaders without formal state mandate.

Heads of state often greet important foreign visitors, particularly visiting heads of state. They assume a host role during a state visit, and the programme may feature playing of the national anthems by a military band, inspection of military troops, official exchange of gifts, and attending a state dinner at the official residence of the host.

At home, heads of state are expected to render lustre to various occasions by their presence, such as by attending artistic or sports performances or competitions (often in a theatrical honour box, on a platform, on the front row, at the honours table), expositions, national day celebrations, dedication events, military parades and war remembrances, prominent funerals, visiting different parts of the country and people from different walks of life, and at times performing symbolic acts such as cutting a ribbon, groundbreaking, ship christening, laying the first stone. Some parts of national life receive their regular attention, often on an annual basis, or even in the form of official patronage.

The Olympic Charter (rule 55.3) of the International Olympic Committee states that the Olympic summer and winter games shall be opened by the head of state of the host nation, by uttering a single formulaic phrase as determined by the charter.

As such invitations may be very numerous, such duties are often in part delegated to such persons as a spouse, a head of government or a cabinet minister or in other cases (possibly as a message, for instance, to distance themselves without rendering offence) just a military officer or civil servant.

For non-executive heads of state there is often a degree of censorship by the politically responsible government (such as the head of government). This means that the government discreetly approves agenda and speeches, especially where the constitution (or customary law) assumes all political responsibility by granting the crown inviolability (in fact also imposing political emasculation) as in the Kingdom of Belgium from its very beginning; in a monarchy this may even be extended to some degree to other members of the dynasty, especially the heir to the throne.

Below follows a list of examples from different countries of general provisions in law, which either designate an office as head of state or define its general purpose.

*&quot;Example 1 (parliamentary monarchy):&quot; Section 56 (1) of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 states:
**&quot;The King is the Head of State, the symbol of its unity and permanence. He arbitrates and moderates the regular functioning of the institutions, assumes the highest representation of the Spanish State in international relations, especially with the nations of its historical community, and exercises the functions expressly conferred on him by the Constitution and the laws.&quot;
*&quot;Example 2 (parliamentary absentee monarchy):&quot; Article 2 of the New Zealand Constitution Act 1986 states:
**&quot;(1) The Sovereign in right of New Zealand is the head of State of New Zealand, and shall be known by the royal style and titles proclaimed from time to time.&quot;
**&quot;(2) The Governor-General appointed by the Sovereign is the Sovereign&#x27;s representative in New Zealand.&quot;
*&quot;Example 3 (parliamentary non-executive monarchy):&quot; Article 1 of the Constitution of Japan states:
**&quot;The Emperor shall be the symbol of the State and of the unity of the People, deriving his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power.&quot;
*&quot;Example 4 (parliamentary republic):&quot; Title II, Article 87 of the Constitution of Italy states:
**&quot;The President of the Republic is the Head of the State and represents national unity.&quot;
*&quot;Example 5 (parliamentary republic):&quot; Article 67 of the Iraqi constitution of 2005 states:
**&quot;The President of the Republic is the Head of the State and a symbol of the unity of the country and represents the sovereignty of the country. He shall guarantee the commitment to the Constitution and the preservation of Iraq&#x27;s independence, sovereignty, unity, and the safety of its territories, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.&quot;
*&quot;Example 6 (semi-presidential republic):&quot; Title II, Chapter I, Article 120 of the Constitution of Portugal states:
**&quot;The President of the Republic represents the Portuguese Republic, guarantees national independence, the unity of the state and the proper operation of the democratic institutions, and is ex officio Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.&quot;
*&quot;Example 7 (presidential republic):&quot; Chapter IV, Section 1, Article 66 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea states:
**&quot;(1)The President shall be the Head of State and represent the State vis-à-vis foreign states.&quot;
**&quot;(2)The President shall have the responsibility and duty to safeguard the independence, territorial integrity and continuity of the State and the Constitution.&quot;
*&quot;Example 8 (semi-presidential republic):&quot; Chapter VI, Article 77 of the Constitution of Lithuania states:
**&quot;The President of the Republic shall be Head of State.&quot;
**&quot;He shall represent the State of Lithuania and shall perform everything with which he is charged by the Constitution and laws.&quot;
*&quot;Example 9 (semi-presidential republic):&quot; Chapter 4, Article 80, Section 1-2 of the Constitution of Russia states:
**&quot;1. The President of the Russian Federation shall be the Head of State.&quot;
**&quot;2. The President of the Russian Federation shall be the guarantor of the Constitution of the Russian Federation and of human and civil rights and freedoms. In accordance with the procedure established by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, he (she) shall adopt measures to protect the sovereignty of the Russian Federation, its independence and State integrity, and shall ensure the coordinated functioning and interaction of State government bodies.&quot;
*&quot;Example 10 (presidential republic):&quot; Section 87 (Second Division, Chapter 1) of the Constitution of Argentina provides that:
**&quot;The Executive Power of the Nation shall be vested in a citizen with the title of &quot;President of the Argentine Nation&quot;.&quot;

===Executive role===
In the majority of states, whether republics or monarchies, executive authority is vested, at least notionally, in the head of state. In presidential systems the head of state is the actual, de facto chief executive officer. Under parliamentary systems the executive authority is exercised by the head of state, but in practice is done so on the advice of the cabinet of ministers. This produces such terms as &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Government&quot; and &quot;His Excellency&#x27;s Government.&quot; Examples of parliamentary systems in which the head of state is notional chief executive include Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, India, Italy, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom.

*&quot;Example 1 (parliamentary monarchy):&quot; According to Section 12 of the Constitution of Denmark 1953:
**&quot;Subject to the limitations laid down in this Constitution Act the King shall have the supreme authority in all the affairs of the Realm, and he shall exercise such supreme authority through the Ministers.&quot;
*&quot;Example 2 (parliamentary absentee monarchy):&quot; Under Chapter II, Section 61 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900:
**&quot;The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor-General as the Queen&#x27;s representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth.&quot;
*&quot;Example 3 (parliamentary republic):&quot; According to Article 26 (2) of the 1975 Constitution of Greece:
**&quot;The executive power shall be exercised by the President of the Republic and the Government.&quot;
*&quot;Example 4 (parliamentary republic):&quot; According to Article 53 (1) of the Constitution of India:
**&quot;The executive power of the union shall be vested in the President and shall be exercised by him either directly or indirectly through the officers subordinate to him in accordance to the Constitution.&quot;
*&quot;Example 5 (semi-presidential republic):&quot; Under Chapter 4, Article 80, Section 3 of the Constitution of Russia:
**&quot;The President of the Russian Federation shall, in accordance with the Constitution of the Russian Federation and federal laws, determine the basic objectives of the internal and foreign policy of the State.&quot;
*&quot;Example 6 (presidential republic):&quot; Title IV, Chapter II, Section I, Article 76 of the Constitution of Brazil:
**&quot;The Executive Power is exercised by the President of the Republic, assisted by the Ministers of State.&quot;
*&quot;Example 7 (presidential republic):&quot; Article 2, Section 1 of the United States Constitution states:
**&quot;The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.&quot;

The few exceptions where the head of state is not even the nominal chief executive - and where supreme executive authority is according to the constitution explicitly vested in a cabinet - include the Czech Republic, Ireland, Israel, Japan and Sweden.

====Appointment of senior officials====
The head of state usually appoints most or all the key officials in the government, including the head of government and other cabinet ministers, key judicial figures; and all major office holders in the civil service, foreign service and commissioned officers in the military. In many parliamentary systems, the head of government is appointed with the consent (in practice often decisive) of the legislature, and other figures are appointed on the head of government&#x27;s advice.

In practice, these decisions are often a formality. The last time the prime minister of the United Kingdom was unilaterally selected by the monarch was in 1963, when Queen Elizabeth II appointed Alec Douglas-Home on the advice of outgoing Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.

In presidential systems, such as that of the United States, appointments are nominated by the president&#x27;s sole discretion, but this nomination is often subject to confirmation by the legislature; and specifically in the US, the Senate has to approve senior executive branch and judicial appointments by a simple majority vote.

The head of state may also dismiss office-holders. There are many variants on how this can be done. For example, members of the Irish Cabinet are dismissed by the president on the advice of the taoiseach; in other instances, the head of state may be able to dismiss an office holder unilaterally; other heads of state, or their representatives, have the theoretical power to dismiss any office-holder, while it is exceptionally rarely used. In France, while the president cannot force the prime minister to tender the resignation of the government, he can, in practice, request it if the prime minister is from his own majority. In presidential systems, the president often has the power to fire ministers at his sole discretion. In the United States, the unwritten convention calls for the heads of the executive departments to resign on their own initiative when called to do so.

*&quot;Example 1 (parliamentary monarchy):&quot; Article 96 of the Constitution of Belgium:
**&quot;The King appoints and dismisses his ministers.The Federal Government offers its resignation to the King if the House of Representatives, by an absolute majority of its members, adopts a motion of no confidence proposing a successor to the prime minister for appointment by the King or proposes a successor to the prime minister for appointment by the King within three days of the rejection of a motion of confidence. The King appoints the proposed successor as prime minister, who takes office when the new Federal Government is sworn in.&quot;
*&quot;Example 2 (parliamentary non-executive republic):&quot; Article 13.1.1 of the Constitution of Ireland:
**&quot;The President shall, on the nomination of Dáil Éireann, appoint the Taoiseach.&quot;
*&quot;Example 3 (semi-presidential republic):&quot; Chapter 4, Section 2 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea states:
**&quot;The Prime Minister is appointed by the President with the consent of the National Assembly.&quot;
*&quot;Example 4 (presidential republic):&quot; Article 84 of the Constitution of Brazil:
**&quot;The President of the Republic shall have the exclusive power to:&quot; 
***&quot;I - appoint and dismiss the Ministers of State:&quot;
***&quot;XIII -...appoint the commanders of Navy, Army and Air Force, to promote general officers and to appoint them to the offices held exclusively by them;&quot;
***&quot;XIV - appoint, after approval by the Senate, the Justices of the Supreme Federal Court and those of the superior courts, the Governors of the territories, the Attorney-General of the Republic, the President and the Directors of the Central Bank and other civil servants, when established by law;&quot;
***&quot;XV - appoint, with due regard for the provisions of article 73, the Justices of the Federal Court of Accounts;&quot;
***&quot;XVI - appoint judges in the events established by this Constitution and the Advocate-General of the Union;&quot;
***&quot;XVII - appoint members of the Council of the Republic, in accordance with article 89, VII&quot;
***&quot;XXV - fill and abolish federal government positions, as set forth by law&quot;.

Some countries have alternative provisions for senior appointments: In Sweden, under the Instrument of Government of 1974, the Speaker of the Riksdag has the role of formally appointing the prime minister, following a vote in the Riksdag, and the prime minister in turn appoints and dismisses cabinet ministers at his/her sole discretion.

====Diplomatic role====


Although many constitutions, particularly from the 19th century and earlier, make no explicit mention of a head of state in the generic sense of several present day international treaties, the officeholders corresponding to this position are recognised as such by other countries. In a monarchy, the monarch is generally understood to be the head of state.
The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which codified longstanding custom, operates under the presumption that the head of a diplomatic mission (i.e. ambassador or nuncio) of the sending state is accredited to the head of state of the receiving state. The head of state accredits (i.e. formally validates) their country&#x27;s ambassadors (or rarer equivalent diplomatic mission chiefs, such as high commissioner or papal nuncio) through sending formal a letter of credence (and a Letter of Recall at the end of a tenure) to other heads of state and, conversely, receives the letters of their foreign counterparts. Without that accreditation, the chief of the diplomatic mission cannot take up their role and receive the highest diplomatic status. The role of a head of state in this regard, is codified in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations from 1961, which (as of 2017) 191 sovereign states has ratified.

However, there are provisions in the Vienna Convention that a diplomatic agent of lesser rank, such as a chargé d&#x27;affaires, is accredited to the minister of foreign affairs (or equivalent).

The head of state is often designated the high contracting party in international treaties on behalf of the state; signs them either personally or has them signed in his/her name by ministers (government members or diplomats); subsequent ratification, when necessary, may rest with the legislature. The treaties constituting the European Union and the European Communities are noteworthy contemporary cases of multilateral treaties cast in this traditional format, as are the accession agreements of new member states. However, rather than being invariably concluded between two heads of state, it has become common that bilateral treaties are in present times cast in an intergovernmental format, e.g., between the &quot;Government of X and the Government of Y&quot;, rather than between &quot;His Majesty the King of X and His Excellency the President of Y&quot;.

*&quot;Example 1 (parliamentary monarchy):&quot; Article 8 of the Constitution of the Principality of Liechtenstein states:
**&quot;1) The Reigning Prince shall represent the State in all its relations with foreign countries, without prejudice to the requisite participation of the responsible Government.&quot;
**&quot;2) Treaties by which territory of the State would be ceded, State property alienated, sovereign rights or prerogatives of the State affected, a new burden imposed on the Principality or its citizens, or an obligation assumed that would limit the rights of the citizens of Liechtenstein shall require the assent of Parliament to attain legal force.&quot;
*&quot;Example 2 (parliamentary republic):&quot; Article 59 (1) of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany states:
**&quot;The Federal President shall represent the Federation in its international relations. He shall conclude treaties with foreign states on behalf of the Federation. He shall accredit and receive envoys.&quot;.
*&quot;Example 3 (semi-presidential republic):&quot; Title II, Article 14 of the French Constitution of 1958 states:
**&quot;The President of the Republic shall accredit ambassadors and envoys extraordinary to foreign powers; foreign ambassadors and envoys extraordinary shall be accredited to him.&quot;
*&quot;Example 4 (semi-presidential republic):&quot; Chapter 4, Article 86, Section 4 of the Constitution of Russia states:
**&quot;The President of the Russian Federation:&quot;
***&quot;a) shall direct the foreign policy of the Russian Federation;&quot;
***&quot;b) shall hold negotiations and sign international treaties of the Russian Federation;&quot;
***&quot;c) shall sign instruments of ratification;&quot;
***&quot;d) shall receive letters of credence and letters of recall of diplomatic representatives accredited to his (her) office.&quot;
*&quot;Example 5 (single party republic):&quot; Section 2, Article 81 of the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China states:
**&quot;The President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China receives foreign diplomatic representatives on behalf of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and, in pursuance of decisions of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress, appoints and recalls plenipotentiary representatives abroad, and ratifies and abrogates treaties and important agreements concluded with foreign states.&quot;

In Canada, these head of state powers belong to the monarch as part of the royal prerogative, but the Governor General has been permitted to exercise them since 1947 and has done so since the 1970s.

====Military role====


A head of state is often, by virtue of holding the highest executive powers, explicitly designated as the commander-in-chief of that nation&#x27;s armed forces, holding the highest office in all military chains of command.

In a constitutional monarchy or non-executive presidency, the head of state may de jure hold ultimate authority over the armed forces but will only normally, as per either written law or unwritten convention, exercise their authority on the advice of their responsible ministers: meaning that the de facto ultimate decision making on military manoeuvres is made elsewhere. The head of state will, regardless of actual authority, perform ceremonial duties related to the country&#x27;s armed forces, and will sometimes appear in military uniform for these purposes; particularly in monarchies where also the monarch&#x27;s consort and other members of a royal family may also appear in military garb. This is generally the only time a head of state of a stable, democratic country will appear dressed in such a manner, as statesmen and public are eager to assert the primacy of (civilian, elected) politics over the armed forces.

In military dictatorships, or governments which have arisen from coups d&#x27;état, the position of commander-in-chief is obvious, as all authority in such a government derives from the application of military force; occasionally a power vacuum created by war is filled by a head of state stepping beyond the normal constitutional role, as King Albert I of Belgium did during World War I. In these and in revolutionary regimes, the head of state, and often executive ministers whose offices are legally civilian, will frequently appear in military uniform.

*&quot;Example 1 (parliamentary monarchy):&quot; Article III, Section 15 of the Constitution Act, 1867, a part of the Constitution of Canada, states:
**&quot;The Command-in-Chief of the Land and Naval Militia, and of all Naval and Military Forces, of and in Canada, is hereby declared to continue to be vested in the Queen.&quot;
*&quot;Example 2 (parliamentary monarchy):&quot; Article 25 of the Constitution of Norway states:
**&quot;The King is Commander-in-Chief of the land and naval forces of the Realm. These forces may not be increased or reduced without the consent of the Storting. They may not be transferred to the service of foreign powers, nor may the military forces of any foreign power, except auxiliary forces assisting against hostile attack, be brought into the Realm without the consent of the Storting.&quot;
**&quot;The territorial army and the other troops which cannot be classed as troops of the line must never, without the consent of the Storting, be employed outside the borders of the Realm.&quot;
*&quot;Example 3 (parliamentary republic):&quot; Chapter II, Article 87, 4th section of the Constitution of Italy states:
**&quot;The President is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, shall preside over the Supreme Council of Defense established by law, and shall make declarations of war as have been agreed by Parliament of Italy.&quot;
*&quot;Example 4 (semi-presidential republic):&quot; Title II, Article 15 of the French Constitution of 1958 states:
**&quot;The President of the Republic shall be Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. He shall preside over the higher national defence councils and committees.&quot;
*&quot;Example 5 (semi-presidential republic):&quot; According to Chapter 4, Article 87, Section 1 of the Constitution of Russia:
**&quot;The President of the Russian Federation shall be the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.&quot;
*&quot;Example 6 (presidential republic):&quot; Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution states:
**&quot;The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States.&quot;
*&quot;Example 7 (executive monarchy):&quot; Article 65 of the Constitution of Qatar provides that:
**&quot;The Emir is the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. He shall supervise the same with the assistance of Defence Council under his direct authority. The said Council shall be constituted by an Emiri Resolution, which will also determine the functions thereof.&quot;

Some countries with a parliamentary system designate officials other than the head of state with command-in-chief powers. 
* In Germany, the Basic Law for the Federal Republic vests this authority in the Minister of Defence in normal peacetime (article 65a), and that command authority is transferred to the federal chancellor when a State of Defence is invoked (article 115b): something which has never happened so far.
* In Israel, the applicable basic law states that the ultimate authority over the Israel Defense Forces rests with the Government of Israel as a collective body. The authority of the Government is exercised by the minister of defence on behalf of the Government, and subordinate to the minister is the chief of general staff who holds the highest level of command within the military.

The armed forces of the Communist states are under the absolute control of the Communist party.
* In China, the command-in-chief of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army is the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, but not the President of China, however, in practice, these offices are held by the same person, who is also General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.

===Legislative roles===
It is usual that the head of state, particularly in parliamentary systems as part of the symbolic role, is the one who opens the annual sessions of the legislature, e.g. the annual State Opening of Parliament with the Speech from the Throne in Britain. Even in presidential systems the head of state often formally reports to the legislature on the present national status, e.g. the State of the Union address in the United States of America, or the State of the Nation Address in South Africa.

Most countries require that all bills passed by the house or houses of the legislature be signed into law by the head of state. In some states, such as the United Kingdom, Belgium and Ireland, the head of state is, in fact, formally considered a tier of the legislature. However, in most parliamentary systems, the head of state cannot refuse to sign a bill, and, in granting a bill their assent, indicate that it was passed in accordance with the correct procedures. The signing of a bill into law is formally known as &quot;promulgation&quot;. Some monarchical states call this procedure &quot;royal assent&quot;.

*&quot;Example 1 (non-executive parliamentary monarchy):&quot; Chapter 1, Article 4 of the Swedish &quot;Riksdag Act&quot; provides that:
**&quot;The formal opening of a Riksdag session takes place at a special meeting of the Chamber held no later than the third day of the session. At this meeting, the Head of State declares the session open at the invitation of the Speaker. If the Head of State is unable to attend, the Speaker declares the session open.&quot;
*&quot;Example 2 (parliamentary monarchy):&quot; Article 9 of the Constitution of the Principality of Liechtenstein provides that:
**&quot;Every law shall require the sanction of the Reigning Prince to attain legal force.&quot;
*&quot;Example 3 (parliamentary republic):&quot; Section 11.a.1. of the Basic Laws of Israel states:
**&quot;The President of the State shall sign every Law, other than a Law relating to its powers.&quot;
*&quot;Example 4 (semi-presidential republic):&quot; According to Chapter 4, Article 84 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation:
**&quot;The President of the Russian Federation:&quot;
***&quot;a) shall announce elections to the State Duma in accordance with the Constitution of the Russian Federation and federal law;&quot;
***&quot;c) shall announce referendums in accordance with the procedure established by federal constitutional law;&quot;
***&quot;d) shall submit draft laws to the State Duma;&quot;
***&quot;e) shall sign and promulgate federal laws;&quot;
***&quot;f) shall address the Federal Assembly with annual messages on the situation in the country and on the basic objectives of the internal and foreign policy of the State.&quot;
*&quot;Example 5 (presidential republic):&quot; Article 1, Section 7 of the United States Constitution states:
**&quot;Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approves he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated... &quot;
*&quot;Example 6 (presidential republic):&quot; Article 84 of the Brazilian Constitution provides that:
**&quot;The President of the Republic shall have the exclusive power to:&quot; 
***&quot;III – start the legislative procedure, in the manner and in the cases set forth in this Constitution;&quot;
***&quot;IV - sanction, promulgate and order the publication of laws, as well as to issue decrees and regulations for the true enforcement thereof;&quot;
***&quot;V - veto bills, wholly or in part;&quot;
***&quot;XI - upon the opening of the legislative session, send a government message and plan to the National Congress, describing the state of the nation and requesting the actions he deems necessary;&quot; 
***&quot;XXIII - submit to the National Congress the pluriannual plan, the bill of budgetary directives and the budget proposals set forth in this Constitution;&quot; 
***&quot;XXIV - render, each year, accounts to the National Congress concerning the previous fiscal year, within sixty days of the opening of the legislative session&quot;.
*&quot;Example 7 (ruling monarchy):&quot; Article 106 of the Constitution of Qatar states:
**&quot;1. Any draft law passed by the Council shall be referred to the Emir for ratification.&quot;
**&quot;2. If the Emir, declines to approve the draft law, he shall return it a long with the reasons for such declination to the Council within a period of three months from the date of referral.&quot;
**&quot;3. In the event that a draft law is returned to the Council within the period specified in the preceding paragraph and the Council passes the same once more with a two-thirds majority of all its Members, the Emir shall ratify and promulgate it. The Emir may in compelling circumstances order the suspension of this law for the period that he deems necessary to serve the higher interests of the country. If, however, the draft law is not passed by a two-thirds majority, it shall not be reconsidered within the same term of session.&quot;

In some parliamentary systems, the head of state retains certain discretionary powers in relation to bills to be exercised. They may have authority to veto a bill until the houses of the legislature have reconsidered it, and approved it a second time; reserve a bill to be signed later, or suspend it indefinitely (generally in states with royal prerogative; this power is rarely used); refer a bill to the courts to test its constitutionality; refer a bill to the people in a referendum.

If the head of state also serves as the chief executive, the head of state can politically control the necessary executive measures without which a proclaimed law can remain dead letter, sometimes for years or even forever.

===Summoning and dissolving the legislature===
A head of state is often empowered to summon and dissolve the country&#x27;s legislature. In most parliamentary systems, this is often done on the advice of the head of government. In some parliamentary systems, and in some presidential systems, however, the head of state may do so on their own initiative. Some states have fixed term legislatures, with no option of bringing forward elections (e.g., Article II, Section 3, of the U.S. Constitution). In other systems there are usually fixed terms, but the head of state retains authority to dissolve the legislature in certain circumstances. Where a head of government has lost support in the legislature, some heads of state may refuse a dissolution, where one is requested, thereby forcing the head of government&#x27;s resignation.

*&quot;Example 1 (parliamentary non-executive republic):&quot; Article 13.2.2. of the Constitution of Ireland states:
**&quot;The President may in absolute discretion refuse to dissolve Dáil Éireann on the advice of a Taoiseach who has ceased to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Éireann.&quot;
*&quot;Example 2 (semi-presidential republic):&quot; Title II, Article 12, first sentence of the French Constitution of 1958 states:
**&quot;The President of the Republic may, after consulting the Prime Minister and the Presidents of the Houses of Parliament, declare the National Assembly dissolved.&quot;
*&quot;Example 3 (semi-presidential republic):&quot; Chapter 4, article 84 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation provides:
**&quot;The President of the Russian Federation:&quot;
***&quot;b) shall dissolve the State Duma in the cases and in accordance with the procedure provided for by the Constitution of the Russian Federation;&quot;

===Other prerogatives===

====Granting titles and honours====
*&quot;Example 1 (parliamentary monarchy):&quot; Article 113 of the Constitution of Belgium states:
**&quot;The King may confer titles of nobility, without ever having the power to attach privileges to them.&quot;
*&quot;Example 2 (parliamentary monarchy):&quot; Article 23 of the Constitution of Norway states:
**&quot;The King may bestow orders upon whomever he pleases as a reward for distinguished services, and such orders must be publicly announced, but no rank or title other than that attached to any office. The order exempts no one from the common duties and burdens of citizens, nor does it carry with it any preferential admission to senior official posts in the State. Senior officials honourably discharged from office retain the title and rank of their office. This does not apply, however, to Members of the Council of State or the State Secretaries.No personal, or mixed, hereditary privileges may henceforth be granted to anyone.&quot;
*&quot;Example 3 (parliamentary republic):&quot; Title II, Article 87, 8th section of the Constitution of Italy states:
**&quot;The President shall confer the honorary distinctions of the Republic.&quot;

====Immunity====

*&quot;Example 1 (parliamentary non-executive monarchy):&quot; Chapter 5, Article 8 of the Swedish Instrument of Government of 1974 states:
**&quot;The King or Queen who is Head of State cannot be prosecuted for his or her actions. Nor can a Regent be prosecuted for his or her actions as Head of State.&quot;
*&quot;Example 2 (parliamentary monarchy):&quot; Article 5 of the Constitution of Norway states:
**&quot;The King&#x27;s person is sacred; he cannot be censured or accused. The responsibility rests with his Council.&quot;
*&quot;Example 3 (parliamentary republic):&quot; Chapter 3, Article 65 of the Constitution of the Czech Republic states:
**&quot;(1) President of the Republic may not be detained, subjected to criminal prosecution or prosecuted for offence or other administrative delict.&quot;
**&quot;(2) President of the Republic may be prosecuted for high treason at the Constitutional Court based on the Senate&#x27;s suit. The punishment may be the loss of his presidential office and of his eligibility to regain it.&quot;
**&quot;(3) Criminal prosecution for criminal offences committed by the President of the Republic while executing his office shall be ruled out forever.&quot;
*&quot;Example 4 (semi-presidential republic):&quot; Title II, Chapter I, Article 130 of the Constitution of Portugal states:
**&quot;1. The President of the Republic answers before the Supreme Court of Justice for crimes committed in the exercise of his functions.&quot;
**&quot;2. Proceedings may only be initiated by the Assembly of the Republic, upon a motion subscribed by one fifth and a decision passed by a two-thirds majority of all the Members of the Assembly of the Republic in full exercise of their office.&quot;
**&quot;3. Conviction implies removal from office and disqualification from re-election.&quot;
**&quot;4. For crimes that are not committed in the exercise of his functions, the President of the Republic answers before the common courts, once his term of office has ended.&quot;
*&quot;Example 5 (executive monarchy):&quot; Article 64 of the Constitution of Qatar:
**&quot;The Emir is the head of State. His person shall be inviolable and he must be respected by all.&quot;

====Reserve powers====
*&quot;Example 1 (semi-presidential republic):&quot; Title II, Article 16 of the French Constitution of 1958 states:
**&quot;Where the institutions of the Republic, the independence of the Nation, the integrity of its territory or the fulfilment of its international commitments are under serious and immediate threat, and where the proper functioning of the constitutional public authorities is interrupted, the President of the Republic shall take measures required by these circumstances, after formally consulting the Prime Minister, the Presidents of the Houses of Parliament and the Constitutional Council.He shall address the Nation and inform it of such measures.The measures shall be designed to provide the constitutional public authorities as swiftly as possible, with the means to carry out their duties. The Constitutional Council shall be consulted with regard to such measures.Parliament shall sit as of right.The National Assembly shall not be dissolved during the exercise of such emergency powers.After thirty days of the exercise of such emergency powers, the matter may be referred to the Constitutional Council by the President of the National Assembly, the President of the Senate, sixty Members of the National Assembly or sixty Senators, so as to decide if the conditions laid down in paragraph one still apply. The Council shall make its decision publicly as soon as possible. It shall, as of right, carry out such an examination and shall make its decision in the same manner after sixty days of the exercise of emergency powers or at any moment thereafter.&quot;
*&quot;Example 2 (executive monarchy):&quot; Articles 69 &amp; 70 of the Constitution of Qatar:
***&quot;The Emir may, be a decree, declare Martial Laws in the country in the event of exceptional cases specified by the law; and in such cases, he may take all urgent necessary measures to counter any threat that undermine the safety of the State, the integrity of its territories or the security of its people and interests or obstruct the organs of the State from performing their duties. However, the decree must specify the nature of such exceptional cases for which the martial laws have been declared and clarify the measures taken to address this situation. Al-Shoura Council shall be notified of this decree within the fifteen days following its issue; and in the event that the Council is not in session for any reason whatsoever, the Council shall be notified of the decree at its first convening. Martial laws shall be declared for a limited period and the same shall not be extended unless approved by Al-Shoura Council.&quot;
***&quot;The Emir may, in the event of exceptional cases that require measures of utmost urgency which necessitate the issue of special laws and in case that Al-Shoura Council is not in session, issue pertinent decrees that have the power of law. Such decree-laws shall be submitted to Al-Shoura Council at its first meeting; and the Council may within a maximum period of forty days from the date of submission and with a two-thirds majority of its Members reject any of these decree-laws or request amendment thereof to be effected within a specified period of time; such decree-laws shall cease to have the power of law from the date of their rejection by the Council or where the period for effecting the amendments have expired.&quot;

====Right of pardon====
*&quot;Example 1 (parliamentary monarchy):&quot; Section 24 of the Constitution of Denmark states:
**&quot;The King can grant pardons and amnesties. He may only pardon Ministers convicted by the Court of Impeachment with the consent of Parliament.&quot;
*&quot;Example 2 (parliamentary republic):&quot; According to Chapter V, Article 60(2) of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany:
**&quot;He The President] shall exercise the power to pardon individual offenders on behalf of the Federation.&quot;
*&quot;Example 3 (semi-presidential republic):&quot; Title II, Article 17 of the French Constitution of 1958 states:
**&quot;The President of the Republic is vested with the power to grant individual pardons.&quot;
*&quot;Example 4 (presidential republic):&quot; Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution of the United States provides that:
**&quot;...and he The President] shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.&quot;
*&quot;Example 5 (presidential parliamentary republic):&quot; Part XI, Article 80 of the Constitution of Nauru:
**&quot;The President may-&quot;
***&quot;(a) grant a pardon, either free or subject to lawful conditions, to a person convicted of an offence;&quot;
***&quot;(b) grant to a person a respite, either indefinite or for a specified period, of the execution of a punishment imposed on that person for an offence;&quot;
***&quot;(c) substitute a less severe form of punishment for any punishment imposed on a person for an offence; or&quot;
***&quot;(d) remit the whole or a part of a punishment imposed on a person for an offence or of a penalty or forfeiture on account of an offence.&quot;

==Official title==
In a republic, the head of state nowadays usually bears the title of President, but some have or have had other titles. Titles commonly used by monarchs are King/Queen or Emperor/Empress, but also many other; e.g., Grand Duke, Prince, Emir and Sultan.

Though president and various monarchical titles are most commonly used for heads of state, in some nationalistic regimes, the leader adopts, formally or de facto, a unique style simply meaning leader in the national language, e.g., Germany&#x27;s single national socialist party chief and combined head of state and government, Adolf Hitler, as the &quot;Führer&quot; between 1934 and 1945.

In 1959, when former British crown colony Singapore gained self-government, it adopted the Malay style &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Negara&quot; (&quot;head of state&quot; in Malay) for its governor (the actual head of state remained the British monarch). The second and last incumbent of the office, Yusof bin Ishak, kept the style at 31 August 1963 unilateral declaration of independence and after 16 September 1963 accession to Malaysia as a state (so now as a constituent part of the federation, a non-sovereign level). After its expulsion from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, Singapore became a sovereign Commonwealth republic and installed Yusof bin Ishak as its first president.

In 1959 after the resignation of Vice President Mohammad Hatta, President Sukarno abolished the position and title of vice-president, assuming the positions of Prime Minister and Head of Cabinet. He also proclaimed himself president for life (Indonesian: &quot;Presiden Seumur Hidup Panglima Tertinggi&quot;; &quot;panglima&quot; meaning &quot;commander or martial figurehead&quot;, &quot;tertinggi&quot; meaning &quot;highest&quot;; roughly translated to English as &quot;Supreme Commander of the Revolution&quot;). He was praised as &quot;Paduka Yang Mulia&quot;, a Malay honorific originally given to kings; Sukarno awarded himself titles in that fashion due to his noble ancestry.

There are also a few nations in which the exact title and definition of the office of head of state have been vague. During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, following the downfall of Chinese President Liu Shaoqi, no successor was named, so the duties of the head of state were transferred collectively to the Vice Presidents Soong Ching-ling and Dong Biwu, then to the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress, but Chairman Mao Zedong was still the paramount leader. This situation was later changed: the President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China is now the head of state. Although the presidency is a largely ceremonial office with limited power, the symbolic role of a head of state is now generally performed by Xi Jinping, who is also General Secretary of the Communist Party (Communist Party leader) and Chairman of the Central Military Commission (Supreme Military Command), making him the most powerful person in China.

In North Korea, the late Kim Il Sung was named &quot;Eternal President&quot; four years after his death and the presidency was abolished. As a result, some of the duties previously held by the president were constitutionally delegated to the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly, who performs some of the roles of a head of state, such as accrediting foreign ambassadors and undertaking overseas visits. However, the &quot;de jure&quot; role of head of state lies within the President of the State Affairs Commission, currently Kim Jong Un, who as the General Secretary of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of North Korea, is the most powerful person in North Korea.

There is debate as to whether Samoa was an elective monarchy or an aristocratic republic, given the comparative ambiguity of the title &quot;O le Ao o le Malo&quot; and the nature of the head of state&#x27;s office.

In some states the office of head of state is not expressed in a specific title reflecting that role, but constitutionally awarded to a post of another formal nature. Colonel Muammar Gaddafi initially ruled as combined head of state and briefly head of government of the Libyan Arab Republic, styled as Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council. In 1977, the Libyan &quot;Jamahiriya&quot; (&quot;state of the masses&quot;) replaced the previous republic, and in March 1979 the role of head of state was transferred to the Secretary-General of the General People&#x27;s Congress (comparable to a Speaker); in practice however Gaddafi remained the &quot;de facto&quot; leader as &quot;Guide of the Revolution&quot; until his overthrow in 2011.

Sometimes a head of state assumes office as a state becomes legal and political reality, before a formal title for the highest office is determined; thus in the since 1 January 1960 independent republic Cameroon (&quot;Cameroun&quot;, a former French colony), the first president, Ahmadou Babatoura Ahidjo, was at first not styled but &#x27;merely&#x27; known as (French for &quot;head of state&quot;) until 5 May 1960. In Uganda, Idi Amin the military leader after the coup of 25 January 1971 was formally styled &quot;military head of state&quot; till 21 February 1971, only from then on as regular (but unconstitutional, unelected) president.

In certain cases a special style is needed to accommodate imperfect statehood, e.g., the title &quot;Sadr-i-Riyasat&quot; was used in Kashmir after its accession to India, and the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, Yasser Arafat, was styled the first &quot;President of the Palestinian National Authority&quot; in 1994. In 2008, the same office was restyled as &quot;President of the State of Palestine&quot;.

==Historical European perspectives==
* The polis in Greek Antiquity and the equivalent city states in the feudal era and later, (many in Italy, the Holy Roman Empire, the Moorish &quot;taifa&quot; in Iberia, essentially tribal-type but urbanised regions throughout the world in the Maya civilisation, etc.) offer a wide spectrum of styles, either monarchic (mostly identical to homonyms in larger states) or republican, see Chief magistrate.
* Doges were elected by their Italian aristocratic republics from a patrician nobility, but &quot;reigned&quot; as sovereign dukes.
* The paradoxical term crowned republic refers to various state arrangements that combine &quot;republican&quot; and &quot;monarchic&quot; characteristics.
* The Netherlands historically had officials called stadholders and stadholders-general, titles meaning &quot;lieutenant&quot; or &quot;governor&quot;, originally for the Habsburg monarchs.

In medieval Catholic Europe, it was universally accepted that the Pope ranked first among all rulers and was followed by the Holy Roman Emperor. The Pope also had the sole right to determine the precedence of all others. This principle was first challenged by a Protestant ruler, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden and was later maintained by his country at the Congress of Westphalia. Great Britain would later claim a break of the old principle for the Quadruple Alliance in 1718. However, it was not until the 1815 Congress of Vienna, when it was decided (due to the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 and the weak position of France and other catholic states to assert themselves) and remains so to this day, that all sovereign states are treated as equals, whether monarchies or republics. On occasions when multiple heads of state or their representatives meet, precedence is by the host usually determined in alphabetical order (in whatever language the host determines, although French has for much of the 19th and 20th centuries been the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of diplomacy) or by date of accession. Contemporary international law on precedence, built upon the universally admitted principles since 1815, derives from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (in particular, articles 13, 16.1 and Appendix iii).

Niccolò Machiavelli used &quot;Prince&quot; () as a generic term for the ruler, similar to contemporary usage of &quot;head of state&quot;, in his classical treatise &quot;The Prince&quot;, originally published in 1532: in fact that particular literary genre it belongs to is known as Mirrors for princes. Thomas Hobbes in his &quot;Leviathan&quot; (1651) used the term &quot;Sovereign&quot;. In Europe the role of a monarchs has gradually transitioned from that of a sovereign rulerin the sense of Divine Right of Kings as articulated by Jean Bodin, Absolutism and the &quot;L&#x27;etat c&#x27;est moi&quot;to that of a constitutional monarch; parallel with the conceptual evolution of sovereignty from merely the personal rule of a single person, to Westphalian sovereignty (Peace of Westphalia ending both the Thirty Years&#x27; War &amp; Eighty Years&#x27; War) and popular sovereignty as in consent of the governed; as shown in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England &amp; Scotland, the French Revolution in 1789, and the German Revolution of 1918–1919. The monarchies who survived through this era were the ones who were willing to subject themselves to constitutional limitations.

==Interim and exceptional cases==
Whenever a head of state is not available for any reason, constitutional provisions may allow the role to fall temporarily to an assigned person or collective body. In a republic, this is - depending on provisions outlined by the constitution or improvised - a vice-president, the chief of government, the legislature or its presiding officer. In a monarchy, this is usually a regent or collegial regency (council). For example, in the United States the vice-president acts when the president is incapacitated, and in the United Kingdom the monarch&#x27;s powers may be delegated to counselors of state when they are abroad or unavailable. Neither of the two co-princes of Andorra is resident in Andorra; each is represented in Andorra by a delegate, though these persons hold no formal title.

There are also several methods of head of state succession in the event of the removal, disability or death of an incumbent head of state.

In exceptional situations, such as war, occupation, revolution or a coup d&#x27;état, constitutional institutions, including the symbolically crucial head of state, may be reduced to a figurehead or be suspended in favour of an emergency office (such as the original Roman dictator) or eliminated by a new &quot;provisionary&quot; regime, such as a collective of the junta type, or removed by an occupying force, such as a military governor (an early example being the Spartan Harmost).

==Shared head of multiple states==
In early modern Europe, a single person was often monarch simultaneously of separate states. A composite monarchy is a retrospective label for those cases where the states were governed entirely separately. Of contemporary terms, a personal union had less government co-ordination than a real union. One of the two co-princes of Andorra is the president of France.

Such arrangements are not to be confused with supranational entities which are not states and are not defined by a common monarchy but may (or not) have a symbolic, essentially protocollary, titled highest office, e.g., Head of the Commonwealth (held by the British monarch, but not legally reserved for it) or &#x27;Head of the Arab Union&#x27; (14 February - 14 July 1958, held by the King of Iraq, during its short-lived Hashemite federation with Jordan).

===Commonwealth realms===

The Commonwealth realms share a monarch, currently Charles III. In the realms other than the United Kingdom, a governor-general (&quot;governor general&quot; in Canada) is appointed by the sovereign, usually on the advice of the relevant prime minister (although sometimes it is based on the result of a vote in the relevant parliament, which is the case for Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands), as a representative and to exercise almost all the royal prerogative according to established constitutional authority. In Australia the present king is generally assumed to be head of state, since the governor-general and the state governors are defined as his &quot;representatives&quot;. However, since the governor-general performs almost all national regal functions, the governor-general has occasionally been referred to as head of state in political and media discussion. To a lesser extent, uncertainty has been expressed in Canada as to which officeholder—the monarch, the governor general, or both—can be considered the head of state. New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Tuvalu explicitly name the monarch as their head of state (though Tuvalu&#x27;s constitution states that &quot;references in any law to the Head of State shall be read as including a reference to the governor-general&quot;). Governors-general are frequently treated as heads of state on state and official visits; at the United Nations, they are accorded the status of head of state in addition to the sovereign.

An example of a governor-general departing from constitutional convention by acting unilaterally (that is, without direction from ministers, parliament, or the monarch) occurred in 1926, when Canada&#x27;s governor general refused the head of government&#x27;s formal advice requesting a dissolution of parliament and a general election. In a letter informing the monarch after the event, the Governor General said: &quot;I have to await the verdict of history to prove my having adopted a wrong course, and this I do with an easy conscience that, right or wrong, I have acted in the interests of Canada and implicated no one else in my decision.&quot;

Another example occurred when, in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, the governor-general unexpectedly dismissed the prime minister in order to break a stalemate between the House of Representatives and Senate over money bills. The governor-general issued a public statement saying he felt it was the only solution consistent with the constitution, his oath of office, and his responsibilities, authority, and duty as governor-general. A letter from the queen&#x27;s private secretary at the time, Martin Charteris, confirmed that the only person competent to commission an Australian prime minister was the governor-general and it would not be proper for the monarch to personally intervene in matters that the Constitution Act so clearly places within the governor-general&#x27;s jurisdiction.

Other Commonwealth realms that are now constituted with a governor-general as the viceregal representative of Charles III are: Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

==Religious heads of state==
Since antiquity, various dynasties or individual rulers have claimed the right to rule by divine authority, such as the Mandate of Heaven and the divine right of kings. Some monarchs even claimed divine ancestry, such as Egyptian pharaohs and Sapa Incas, who claimed descent from their respective sun gods and often sought to maintain this bloodline by practising incestuous marriage. In Ancient Rome, during the Principate, the title (&#x27;divine&#x27;) was conferred (notably posthumously) on the emperor, a symbolic, legitimating element in establishing a de facto dynasty.

===Christianity===
In Roman Catholicism, the pope was once sovereign pontiff and head of state, first, of the politically important Papal States. After Italian unification, the pope remains head of state of Vatican City. Furthermore, the bishop of Urgell is &quot;ex officio&quot; one of the two co-princes of Andorra. In the Church of England, the reigning monarch holds the title Defender of the Faith and acts as supreme governor of the Church of England, although this is purely a symbolic role.

===Islam===

During the early period of Islam, caliphs were spiritual and temporal absolute successors of Muhammad. Various political Muslim leaders since have styled themselves &quot;Caliph&quot; and served as dynastic heads of state, sometimes in addition to another title, such as the Ottoman Sultan. Historically, some theocratic Islamic states known as &quot;imamates&quot; have been led by imams as head of state, such as in what is now Oman, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia.

In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Supreme Leader, at present Ali Khamenei serves as head of state. The Aga Khans, a unique dynasty of temporal/religious leadership, leading the Nizari offshoot of Shia Islam in Central and South Asia, once ranking among British India&#x27;s princely states, continue to the present day.

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism, certain dynasties adopted a title expressing their positions as &quot;servant&quot; of a patron deity of the state, but in the sense of a viceroy under an absentee god-king, ruling &quot;in the name of&quot; the patron god(ess), such as Padmanabha Dasa (servant of Vishnu) in the case of the Maharaja of Travancore.

===Buddhism===
From the time of the 5th Dalai Lama until the political retirement of the 14th Dalai Lama in 2011, Dalai Lamas were both political and spiritual leaders (&quot;god-king&quot;) of Tibet.

Outer Mongolia, the former homeland of the imperial dynasty of Genghis Khan, was another lamaist theocracy from 1585, using various styles, such as tulku. The establishment of the Communist Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic replaced this regime in 1924.

==Multiple or collective heads of state==
Sometimes multiple individuals are co-equal heads of state, or a corporate person embodies the functions of head of state. In some cases precedence rotates among the members of the collective as the term of office progresses. Of multiple royal systems, a diarchy, in which two rulers is the constitutional norm, may be distinguished from a coregency, in which a monarchy experiences an exceptional period of multiple rulers. Examples of collective republican systems include nominal triumvirates; the French Directory of the 1790s; the seven-member Swiss Federal Council, where each member acts in turn as President for one year; the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina with members from three nations; the two Captains Regent of San Marino, which maintains the tradition of Italian medieval republics that had always had an even number of consuls.

In the Roman Republic there were two heads of state, styled consul, both of whom alternated months of authority during their year in office, similarly there was an even number of supreme magistrates in the Italic republics of Ancient Age. In the Athenian Republic there were nine supreme magistrates, styled archons. In Carthage there were two supreme magistrates, styled kings or suffetes (judges). In ancient Sparta there were two hereditary kings, belonging to two dynasties. 

In the Soviet Union, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (between 1938 and 1989) and the earlier Central Executive Committee (CEC) of the Congress of Soviets (between 1922 and 1938) served as the collective head of state. After World War II the Soviet model was subsequently adopted by almost all countries belonged to its sphere of influence. Czechoslovakia remained the only country among them that retained an office of president as a form of a single head of state throughout this period; Poland and Hungary, which initially had western-style constitutions (and therefore, western-style presidencies), switched to the presidium model with the adoption of new Soviet-influenced constitutions; Romania, which was a monarchy before the Soviet takeover, was the only country to move to a unitary presidency from a collective head of state, a move done by dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1974. 

A modern example of a collective head of state is the Sovereignty Council of Sudan, the interim ruling council of Sudan. The Sovereignty Council comprises 11 ministers, who together have exercised all governmental functions for Sudan since the fall of President Omar Al-Bashir. Decisions are made either by consensus or by a super majority vote (8 members).

The National Government of the Republic of China, established in 1928, had a panel of about 40 people as collective head of state. Though beginning that year, a provisional constitution made the Kuomintang the sole government party and the National Government bound to the instructions of the Central Executive Committee of that party.

==Legitimacy==
The position of head of state can be established in different ways, and with different sources of legitimacy.

===By fiction or fiat===
Power can come from force, but formal legitimacy is often established, even if only by fictitious claims of continuity (e.g., a forged claim of descent from a previous dynasty). There have been cases of sovereignty granted by deliberate act, even when accompanied by orders of succession (as may be the case in a dynastic split). Such grants of sovereignty are usually forced, as is common with self-determination granted after nationalist revolts. This occurred with the last Attalid king of Hellenistic Pergamon, who by testament left his realm to Rome to avoid a disastrous conquest.

===By divine appointment===
Under a theocracy, perceived divine status translated into earthly authority under divine law. This can take the form of supreme divine authority above the state&#x27;s, granting a tool for political influence to a priesthood. In this way, the Amun priesthood reversed the reforms of Pharaoh Akhenaten after his death. The division of theocratic power can be disputed, as happened between the Pope and Holy Roman Emperor in the investiture conflict when the temporal power sought to control key clergy nominations in order to guarantee popular support, and thereby his own legitimacy, by incorporating the formal ceremony of unction during coronation.

===By social contract===
The notion of a social contract holds that the nation—either the whole people or the electorate—gives a mandate, through acclamation or election.

===By constitution===
Individual heads of state may acquire their position by virtue of a constitution, typically as a transitional measure as part of establishing the new form of government that the constitution decrees: For example, transitional provision 1 of the Constitution of Italy states that once the constitution enters into force, the would automatically become President of Italy under it. An extreme example of this approach is Seychelles, where the 1976 Independence Constitution&#x27;s Article 31 stated that James Mancham would be the first President of Seychelles by name, rather than by the fact he was the prime minister of colonial Seychelles immediately before independence.

===By hereditary succession===
The position of a monarch is usually hereditary, but in constitutional monarchies, there are usually restrictions on the incumbent&#x27;s exercise of powers and prohibitions on the possibility of choosing a successor by other means than by birth. In a hereditary monarchy, the position of monarch is inherited according to a statutory or customary order of succession, usually within one royal family tracing its origin through a historical dynasty or bloodline. This usually means that the heir to the throne is known well in advance of becoming monarch to ensure a smooth succession. However, many cases of uncertain succession in European history have often led to wars of succession.

Primogeniture, in which the eldest child of the monarch is first in line to become monarch, is the most common system in hereditary monarchy. The order of succession is usually affected by rules on gender. Historically &quot;agnatic primogeniture&quot; or &quot;patrilineal primogeniture&quot; was favoured, that is inheritance according to seniority of birth among the sons of a monarch or head of family, with sons and their male issue inheriting before brothers and their male issue, to the total exclusion of females and descendants through females from succession. This complete exclusion of females from dynastic succession is commonly referred to as application of the Salic law. Another variation on agnatic primogeniture was the so-called semi-Salic law, or &quot;agnatic-cognatic primogeniture&quot;, which allowed women to succeed only at the extinction of all the male descendants in the male line of the particular legislator.

Before primogeniture was enshrined in European law and tradition, kings would often secure the succession by having their successor (usually their eldest son) crowned during their own lifetime, so for a time there would be two kings in coregency – a senior king and a junior king. Examples include Henry the Young King of England and the early Direct Capetians in France.

Sometimes, however, primogeniture can operate through the female line. In some systems a female may rule as monarch only when the male line dating back to a common ancestor is exhausted. In 1980, Sweden, by rewriting its 1810 Act of Succession, became the first monarchy to declare equal (full cognatic) primogeniture, meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, whether female or male, ascends to the throne. Other European monarchies (such as the Netherlands in 1983, Norway in 1990 and Belgium in 1991) have since followed suit. Similar reforms were proposed in 2011 for the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, which came into effect in 2015 after having been approved by all of the affected nations. Sometimes religion is affected; under the Act of Settlement 1701 all Roman Catholics and all persons who have married Roman Catholics are ineligible to be the British monarch and are skipped in the order of succession.

In some monarchies there may be liberty for the incumbent, or some body convening after the death of the monarch, to choose from eligible members of the ruling house, often limited to legitimate descendants of the dynasty&#x27;s founder. Rules of succession may be further limited by state religion, residency, equal marriage or even permission from the legislature.

Other hereditary systems of succession included tanistry, which is semi-elective and gives weight to merit and Agnatic seniority. In some monarchies, such as Saudi Arabia, succession to the throne usually first passes to the monarch&#x27;s next eldest brother, and only after that to the monarch&#x27;s children (agnatic seniority).

===By election===

Election usually is the constitutional way to choose the head of state of a republic, and some monarchies, either directly through popular election, indirectly by members of the legislature or of a special college of electors (such as the Electoral College in the United States), or as an exclusive prerogative. Exclusive prerogative allows the heads of states of constituent monarchies of a federation to choose the head of state for the federation among themselves, as in the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia. The Pope, head of state of Vatican City, is chosen by previously appointed cardinals under 80 years of age from among themselves in a papal conclave.

===By appointment===
A head of state can be empowered to designate his successor, such as Lord Protector of the Commonwealth Oliver Cromwell, who was succeeded by his son Richard.

===By force or revolution===
A head of state may seize power by force or revolution. This is not the same as the use of force to &quot;maintain&quot; power, as is practised by authoritarian or totalitarian rulers. Dictators often use democratic titles, though some proclaim themselves monarchs. Examples of the latter include Emperor Napoleon I of France and King Zog of Albania. In Spain, general Francisco Franco adopted the formal title &quot;Jefe del Estado&quot;, or Chief of State, and established himself as regent for a vacant monarchy. Uganda&#x27;s Idi Amin was one of several who named themselves President for Life.

===By foreign imposition===
A foreign power can establishing a branch of their own dynasty, or one friendly to their interests. This was often the outcome of the wars fought between the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire over control of Armenia, a vital buffer state between the two realms.
The Roman–Parthian War of 58–63 ended with a compromise: a Parthian prince of the Arsacid line would henceforth sit on the Armenian throne, but his nomination had to be approved by the Roman emperor.

===Loss===
Apart from violent overthrow, a head of state&#x27;s position can be lost in several ways, including death, another by expiration of the constitutional term of office, abdication, or resignation. In some cases, an abdication cannot occur unilaterally, but comes into effect only when approved by an act of parliament, as in the case of British King Edward VIII. The post can also be abolished by constitutional change; in such cases, an incumbent may be allowed to finish their term. Of course, a head of state position will cease to exist if the state itself does.

Heads of state generally enjoy widest inviolability, although some states allow impeachment, or a similar constitutional procedure by which the highest legislative or judicial authorities are empowered to revoke the head of state&#x27;s mandate on exceptional grounds. This may be a common crime, a political sin, or an act by which the head of state violates such provisions as an established religion mandatory for the monarch. By similar procedure, an original mandate may be declared invalid.

==Former heads of state==
Effigies, memorials and monuments of former heads of state can be designed to represent the history or aspirations of a state or its people, such as the equestrian bronze sculpture of Kaiser Wilhelm I, first Emperor of a unified Germany erected in Berlin at the end of the nineteenth century; or the Victoria Memorial erected in front of Buckingham Palace London, commemorating Queen Victoria and her reign (1837–1901), and unveiled in 1911 by her grandson, King George V; or the monument, placed in front of the Victoria Memorial Hall, Kolkata (Calcutta) (1921), commemorating Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign as Empress of India from 1876. Another, twentieth century, example is the Mount Rushmore National Memorial, a group sculpture constructed (1927–1941) on a conspicuous skyline in the Black Hills of South Dakota (40th state of the Union, 1889), in the midwestern United States, representing the territorial expansion of the United States in the first 130 years from its founding, which is promoted as the &quot;Shrine of Democracy&quot;.

===Personal influence or privileges===
Former presidents of the United States, while holding no political powers per se, sometimes continue to exert influence in national and world affairs.

A monarch may retain his style and certain prerogatives after abdication, as did King Leopold III of Belgium, who left the throne to his son after winning a referendum which allowed him to retain a full royal household deprived him of a constitutional or representative role. Napoleon transformed the Italian principality of Elba, where he was imprisoned, into a miniature version of his First Empire, with most trappings of a sovereign monarchy, until his &quot;Cent Jours&quot; escape and reseizure of power in France convinced his opponents, reconvening the Vienna Congress in 1815, to revoke his gratuitous privileges and send him to die in exile on barren Saint Helena.

By tradition, deposed monarchs who have not freely abdicated continue to use their monarchical titles as a courtesy for the rest of their lives. Hence, even after Constantine II ceased to be &quot;King of the Hellenes&quot;, it is still common to refer to the deposed king and his family as if Constantine II were still on the throne, as many European royal courts and households do in guest lists at royal weddings, as in Sweden in 2010, Britain in 2011 and Luxembourg in 2012. The current Hellenic Republic opposes the right of their deposed monarch and former royal family members to be referred to by their former titles or bearing a surname indicating royal status, and has enacted legislation which hinders acquisition of Greek citizenship unless those terms are met. The former king brought this issue, along with property ownership issues, before the European Court of Human Rights for alleged violations of the European Convention on Human Rights, but lost with respect to the name issue.

However, some other states have no problem with deposed monarchs being referred to by their former title, and even allow them to travel internationally on the state&#x27;s diplomatic passport.

The Italian constitution provides that a former president of the Republic takes the title President Emeritus of the Italian Republic and he or she is also a senator for life, and enjoys immunity, flight status and official residences certain privileges.

<text>Heredity, also called inheritance or biological inheritance, is the passing on of traits from parents to their offspring; either through asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction, the offspring cells or organisms acquire the genetic information of their parents. Through heredity, variations between individuals can accumulate and cause species to evolve by natural selection. The study of heredity in biology is genetics.

==Overview==

In humans, eye color is an example of an inherited characteristic: an individual might inherit the &quot;brown-eye trait&quot; from one of the parents. Inherited traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism&#x27;s genome is called its genotype.

The complete set of observable traits of the structure and behavior of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits arise from the interaction of the organism&#x27;s genotype with the environment. As a result, many aspects of an organism&#x27;s phenotype are not inherited. For example, suntanned skin derives from the interaction between a person&#x27;s genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people&#x27;s children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in their genotype: a striking example is people with the inherited trait of albinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn.

Heritable traits are known to be passed from one generation to the next via DNA, a molecule that encodes genetic information. DNA is a long polymer that incorporates four types of bases, which are interchangeable. The Nucleic acid sequence (the sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule) specifies the genetic information: this is comparable to a sequence of letters spelling out a passage of text. Before a cell divides through mitosis, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. A portion of a DNA molecule that specifies a single functional unit is called a gene; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes. Organisms inherit genetic material from their parents in the form of homologous chromosomes, containing a unique combination of DNA sequences that code for genes. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus. If the DNA sequence at a particular locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism.

However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by multiple interacting genes within and among organisms. Developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions in genetic networks and communication among cells can lead to heritable variations that may underlie some of the mechanics in developmental plasticity and canalization.

Recent findings have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot be explained by direct agency of the DNA molecule. These phenomena are classed as epigenetic inheritance systems that are causally or independently evolving over genes. Research into modes and mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance is still in its scientific infancy, but this area of research has attracted much recent activity as it broadens the scope of heritability and evolutionary biology in general. DNA methylation marking chromatin, self-sustaining metabolic loops, gene silencing by RNA interference, and the three dimensional conformation of proteins (such as prions) are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level. Heritability may also occur at even larger scales. For example, ecological inheritance through the process of niche construction is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment. This generates a legacy of effect that modifies and feeds back into the selection regime of subsequent generations. Descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors. Other examples of heritability in evolution that are not under the direct control of genes include the inheritance of cultural traits, group heritability, and symbiogenesis. These examples of heritability that operate above the gene are covered broadly under the title of multilevel or hierarchical selection, which has been a subject of intense debate in the history of evolutionary science.

==Relation to theory of evolution==

When Charles Darwin proposed his theory of evolution in 1859, one of its major problems was the lack of an underlying mechanism for heredity. Darwin believed in a mix of blending inheritance and the inheritance of acquired traits (pangenesis). Blending inheritance would lead to uniformity across populations in only a few generations and then would remove variation from a population on which natural selection could act. This led to Darwin adopting some Lamarckian ideas in later editions of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; and his later biological works. Darwin&#x27;s primary approach to heredity was to outline how it appeared to work (noticing that traits that were not expressed explicitly in the parent at the time of reproduction could be inherited, that certain traits could be sex-linked, etc.) rather than suggesting mechanisms.

Darwin&#x27;s initial model of heredity was adopted by, and then heavily modified by, his cousin Francis Galton, who laid the framework for the biometric school of heredity. Galton found no evidence to support the aspects of Darwin&#x27;s pangenesis model, which relied on acquired traits.

The inheritance of acquired traits was shown to have little basis in the 1880s when August Weismann cut the tails off many generations of mice and found that their offspring continued to develop tails.

== History ==

Scientists in Antiquity had a variety of ideas about heredity: Theophrastus proposed that male flowers caused female flowers to ripen; Hippocrates speculated that &quot;seeds&quot; were produced by various body parts and transmitted to offspring at the time of conception; and Aristotle thought that male and female fluids mixed at conception. Aeschylus, in 458 BC, proposed the male as the parent, with the female as a &quot;nurse for the young life sown within her&quot;.

Ancient understandings of heredity transitioned to two debated doctrines in the 18th century. The Doctrine of Epigenesis and the Doctrine of Preformation were two distinct views of the understanding of heredity. The Doctrine of Epigenesis, originated by Aristotle, claimed that an embryo continually develops. The modifications of the parent&#x27;s traits are passed off to an embryo during its lifetime. The foundation of this doctrine was based on the theory of inheritance of acquired traits. In direct opposition, the Doctrine of Preformation claimed that &quot;like generates like&quot; where the germ would evolve to yield offspring similar to the parents. The Preformationist view believed procreation was an act of revealing what had been created long before. However, this was disputed by the creation of the cell theory in the 19th century, where the fundamental unit of life is the cell, and not some preformed parts of an organism. Various hereditary mechanisms, including blending inheritance were also envisaged without being properly tested or quantified, and were later disputed. Nevertheless, people were able to develop domestic breeds of animals as well as crops through artificial selection. The inheritance of acquired traits also formed a part of early Lamarckian ideas on evolution.

During the 18th century, Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723) discovered &quot;animalcules&quot; in the sperm of humans and other animals. Some scientists speculated they saw a &quot;little man&quot; (homunculus) inside each sperm. These scientists formed a school of thought known as the &quot;spermists&quot;. They contended the only contributions of the female to the next generation were the womb in which the homunculus grew, and prenatal influences of the womb. An opposing school of thought, the ovists, believed that the future human was in the egg, and that sperm merely stimulated the growth of the egg. Ovists thought women carried eggs containing boy and girl children, and that the gender of the offspring was determined well before conception.

An early research initiative emerged in 1878 when Alpheus Hyatt led an investigation to study the laws of heredity through compiling data on family phenotypes (nose size, ear shape, etc.) and expression of pathological conditions and abnormal characteristics, particularly with respect to the age of appearance. One of the projects aims was to tabulate data to better understand why certain traits are consistently expressed while others are highly irregular.

===Gregor Mendel: father of genetics===

The idea of particulate inheritance of genes can be attributed to the Moravian monk Gregor Mendel who published his work on pea plants in 1865. However, his work was not widely known and was rediscovered in 1901. It was initially assumed that Mendelian inheritance only accounted for large (qualitative) differences, such as those seen by Mendel in his pea plants – and the idea of additive effect of (quantitative) genes was not realised until R.A. Fisher&#x27;s (1918) paper, &quot;The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance&quot; Mendel&#x27;s overall contribution gave scientists a useful overview that traits were inheritable. His pea plant demonstration became the foundation of the study of Mendelian Traits. These traits can be traced on a single locus.

===Modern development of genetics and heredity===

In the 1930s, work by Fisher and others resulted in a combination of Mendelian and biometric schools into the modern evolutionary synthesis. The modern synthesis bridged the gap between experimental geneticists and naturalists; and between both and palaeontologists, stating that:

# All evolutionary phenomena can be explained in a way consistent with known genetic mechanisms and the observational evidence of naturalists.
# Evolution is gradual: small genetic changes, recombination ordered by natural selection. Discontinuities amongst species (or other taxa) are explained as originating gradually through geographical separation and extinction (not saltation).
# Selection is overwhelmingly the main mechanism of change; even slight advantages are important when continued. The object of selection is the phenotype in its surrounding environment. The role of genetic drift is equivocal; though strongly supported initially by Dobzhansky, it was downgraded later as results from ecological genetics were obtained.
# The primacy of population thinking: the genetic diversity carried in natural populations is a key factor in evolution. The strength of natural selection in the wild was greater than expected; the effect of ecological factors such as niche occupation and the significance of barriers to gene flow are all important.

The idea that speciation occurs after populations are reproductively isolated has been much debated. In plants, polyploidy must be included in any view of speciation. Formulations such as &#x27;evolution consists primarily of changes in the frequencies of alleles between one generation and another&#x27; were proposed rather later. The traditional view is that developmental biology (&#x27;evo-devo&#x27;) played little part in the synthesis, but an account of Gavin de Beer&#x27;s work by Stephen Jay Gould suggests he may be an exception.

Almost all aspects of the synthesis have been challenged at times, with varying degrees of success. There is no doubt, however, that the synthesis was a great landmark in evolutionary biology. It cleared up many confusions, and was directly responsible for stimulating a great deal of research in the post-World War II era.

Trofim Lysenko however caused a backlash of what is now called Lysenkoism in the Soviet Union when he emphasised Lamarckian ideas on the inheritance of acquired traits. This movement affected agricultural research and led to food shortages in the 1960s and seriously affected the USSR.

There is growing evidence that there is transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic changes in humans and other animals.

===Common genetic disorders===
:*Fragile X syndrome
:*Sickle cell disease
:*Phenylketonuria (PKU)
:*Haemophilia

==Types==

The description of a mode of biological inheritance consists of three main categories:

:1. Number of involved loci
:*Monogenetic (also called &quot;simple&quot;) – one locus
:*Oligogenic – few loci
:*Polygenetic – many loci

:2. Involved chromosomes

:*Autosomal – loci are not situated on a sex chromosome
:*Gonosomal – loci are situated on a sex chromosome
:**X-chromosomal – loci are situated on the X-chromosome (the more common case)
:**Y-chromosomal – loci are situated on the Y-chromosome
:*Mitochondrial – loci are situated on the mitochondrial DNA

:3. Correlation genotype–phenotype
:*Dominant
:*Intermediate (also called &quot;codominant&quot;)
:*Recessive
:*Overdominant
:*Underdominant

These three categories are part of every exact description of a mode of inheritance in the above order. In addition, more specifications may be added as follows:

:4. Coincidental and environmental interactions

:*Penetrance
:**Complete
:**Incomplete (percentual number)
:*Expressivity
:**Invariable
:**Variable
:*Heritability (in polygenetic and sometimes also in oligogenetic modes of inheritance)
:*Maternal or paternal imprinting phenomena (also see epigenetics)

:5. Sex-linked interactions

:*Sex-linked inheritance (gonosomal loci)
:*Sex-limited phenotype expression (e.g., cryptorchism)
:*Inheritance through the maternal line (in case of mitochondrial DNA loci)
:*Inheritance through the paternal line (in case of Y-chromosomal loci)

:6. Locus–locus interactions
:*Epistasis with other loci (e.g., overdominance)
:*Gene coupling with other loci (also see crossing over)
:*Homozygotous lethal factors
:*Semi-lethal factors

Determination and description of a mode of inheritance is also achieved primarily through statistical analysis of pedigree data. In case the involved loci are known, methods of molecular genetics can also be employed.

===Dominant and recessive alleles===
An allele is said to be dominant if it is always expressed in the appearance of an organism (phenotype) provided that at least one copy of it is present. For example, in peas the allele for green pods, &quot;G&quot;, is dominant to that for yellow pods, &quot;g&quot;. Thus pea plants with the pair of alleles either &quot;GG&quot; (homozygote) or &quot;Gg&quot; (heterozygote) will have green pods. The allele for yellow pods is recessive. The effects of this allele are only seen when it is present in both chromosomes, &quot;gg&quot; (homozygote). This derives from Zygosity, the degree to which both copies of a chromosome or gene have the same genetic sequence, in other words, the degree of similarity of the alleles in an organism.

<doc id="13458" wikidata="Q104813325" url="?curid=13458" title="List of historical films set in Near Eastern and Western civilization">
<text>The historical drama or period drama is a film genre in which stories are based upon historical events and famous people. Some historical dramas are docudramas, which attempt to accurately portray a historical event or biography to the degree the available historical research will allow. Other historical dramas are fictionalized tales that are based on an actual person and their deeds, such as &quot;Braveheart&quot;, which is loosely based on the 13th-century knight William Wallace&#x27;s fight for Scotland&#x27;s independence.

Due to the sheer volume of films included in this genre and the interest in continuity, this list is primarily focused on films about the history of Near Eastern and Western civilization.

<doc id="13459" wikidata="Q42511" url="?curid=13459" title="H. G. Wells">
<text>Herbert George Wells (21 September 1866 – 13 August 1946) was an English writer, prolific in many genres. He wrote more than fifty novels and dozens of short stories. His non-fiction output included works of social commentary, politics, history, popular science, satire, biography, and autobiography. Wells&#x27; science fiction novels are so well regarded that he has been called the &quot;father of science fiction&quot;.

In addition to his fame as a writer, he was prominent in his lifetime as a forward-looking, even prophetic social critic who devoted his literary talents to the development of a progressive vision on a global scale. As a futurist, he wrote a number of utopian works and foresaw the advent of aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television and something resembling the World Wide Web. His science fiction imagined time travel, alien invasion, invisibility and biological engineering before these subjects were common in the genre. Brian Aldiss referred to Wells as the &quot;Shakespeare of science fiction&quot;, while Charles Fort called him a &quot;wild talent&quot;.

Wells rendered his works convincing by instilling commonplace detail alongside a single extraordinary assumption per workdubbed &quot;Wells&#x27;s law&quot;leading Joseph Conrad to hail him in 1898 with &quot;O Realist of the Fantastic!&quot;. His most notable science fiction works include &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1895), which was his first novella, &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot; (1896), &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1897), &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1898), the military science fiction &quot;The War in the Air&quot; (1907), and the dystopian &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot; (1910). Novels of social realism such as &quot;Kipps&quot; (1905) and &quot;The History of Mr Polly&quot; (1910), which describe lower-middle-class English life, led to the suggestion that he was a worthy successor to Charles Dickens, but Wells described a range of social strata and even attempted, in &quot;Tono-Bungay&quot; (1909), a diagnosis of English society as a whole. Wells was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times.

Wells&#x27;s earliest specialised training was in biology, and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a Darwinian context. He was also an outspoken socialist from a young age, often (but not always, as at the beginning of the First World War) sympathising with pacifist views. In his later years, he wrote less fiction and more works expounding his political and social views, sometimes giving his profession as that of journalist. Wells was a diabetic and co-founded the charity The Diabetic Association (Diabetes UK) in 1934.

==Life==
===Early life===

Herbert George Wells was born at Atlas House, 162 High Street in Bromley, Kent, on 21 September 1866. Called &quot;Bertie&quot; by his family, he was the fourth and last child of Joseph Wells, a former domestic gardener, and at the time a shopkeeper and professional cricketer and Sarah Neal, a former domestic servant. An inheritance had allowed the family to acquire a shop in which they sold china and sporting goods, although it failed to prosper in part because the stock was old and worn out, and the location was poor. Joseph Wells managed to earn a meagre income, but little of it came from the shop and he received an unsteady amount of money from playing professional cricket for the Kent county team.

A defining incident of young Wells&#x27;s life was an accident in 1874 that left him bedridden with a broken leg. To pass the time he began to read books from the local library, brought to him by his father. He soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access; they also stimulated his desire to write. Later that year he entered Thomas Morley&#x27;s Commercial Academy, a private school founded in 1849, following the bankruptcy of Morley&#x27;s earlier school. The teaching was erratic, and the curriculum mostly focused, Wells later said, on producing copperplate handwriting and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen. Wells continued at Morley&#x27;s Academy until 1880. In 1877, his father, Joseph Wells, fractured his thigh. The accident effectively put an end to Joseph&#x27;s career as a cricketer, and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income.
No longer able to support themselves financially, the family instead sought to place their sons as apprentices in various occupations. From 1880 to 1883, Wells had an unhappy apprenticeship as a draper at Hyde&#x27;s Drapery Emporium in Southsea. His experiences at Hyde&#x27;s, where he worked a thirteen-hour day and slept in a dormitory with other apprentices, later inspired his novels &quot;The Wheels of Chance&quot;, &quot;The History of Mr Polly&quot;, and &quot;Kipps&quot;, which portray the life of a draper&#x27;s apprentice as well as providing a critique of society&#x27;s distribution of wealth.

Wells&#x27;s parents had a turbulent marriage, owing primarily to his mother being a Protestant and his father being a freethinker. When his mother returned to work as a lady&#x27;s maid (at Uppark, a country house in West Sussex), one of the conditions of work was that she would not be permitted to have living space for her husband and children. Thereafter, she and Joseph lived separate lives, though they never divorced and remained faithful to each other. As a consequence, Herbert&#x27;s personal troubles increased as he subsequently failed as a draper and also, later, as a chemist&#x27;s assistant. However, Uppark had a magnificent library in which he immersed himself, reading many classic works, including Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot;, and the works of Daniel Defoe. When he became the first doyen of science fiction as a distinct genre of fiction, Wells referenced Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; in relation to his works, writing, &quot;they belong to a class of writing which includes the story of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.&quot;

===Teacher===

In October 1879, Wells&#x27;s mother arranged through a distant relative, Arthur Williams, for him to join the National School at Wookey in Somerset as a pupil–teacher, a senior pupil who acted as a teacher of younger children. In December that year, however, Williams was dismissed for irregularities in his qualifications and Wells was returned to Uppark. After a short apprenticeship at a chemist in nearby Midhurst and an even shorter stay as a boarder at Midhurst Grammar School, he signed his apprenticeship papers at Hyde&#x27;s. In 1883, Wells persuaded his parents to release him from the apprenticeship, taking an opportunity offered by Midhurst Grammar School again to become a pupil–teacher; his proficiency in Latin and science during his earlier short stay had been remembered.

The years he spent in Southsea had been the most miserable of his life to that point, but his good fortune in securing a position at Midhurst Grammar School meant that Wells could continue his self-education in earnest. The following year, Wells won a scholarship to the Normal School of Science (later the Royal College of Science in South Kensington, which became part of Imperial College London) in London, studying biology under Thomas Henry Huxley. As an alumnus, he later helped to set up the Royal College of Science Association, of which he became the first president in 1909. Wells studied in his new school until 1887, with a weekly allowance of 21 shillings (a guinea) thanks to his scholarship. This ought to have been a comfortable sum of money (at the time many working class families had &quot;round about a pound a week&quot; as their entire household income), yet in his &quot;Experiment in Autobiography&quot; Wells speaks of constantly being hungry, and indeed photographs of him at the time show a youth who is very thin and malnourished.

He soon entered the debating society of the school. These years mark the beginning of his interest in a possible reformation of society. At first approaching the subject through Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, he soon turned to contemporary ideas of socialism as expressed by the recently formed Fabian Society and free lectures delivered at Kelmscott House, the home of William Morris. He was also among the founders of &quot;The Science School Journal&quot;, a school magazine that allowed him to express his views on literature and society, as well as trying his hand at fiction; a precursor to his novel &quot;The Time Machine&quot; was published in the journal under the title &quot;The Chronic Argonauts&quot;. The school year 1886–87 was the last year of his studies.
During 1888, Wells stayed in Stoke-on-Trent, living in Basford. The unique environment of The Potteries was certainly an inspiration. He wrote in a letter to a friend from the area that &quot;the district made an immense impression on me&quot;. The inspiration for some of his descriptions in &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; is thought to have come from his short time spent here, seeing the iron foundry furnaces burn over the city, shooting huge red light into the skies. His stay in The Potteries also resulted in the macabre short story &quot;The Cone&quot; (1895, contemporaneous with his famous &quot;The Time Machine&quot;), set in the north of the city.

After teaching for some time—he was briefly on the staff of Holt Academy in Wales—Wells found it necessary to supplement his knowledge relating to educational principles and methodology and entered the College of Preceptors (College of Teachers). He later received his Licentiate and Fellowship FCP diplomas from the college. It was not until 1890 that Wells earned a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology from the University of London External Programme. In 1889–90, he managed to find a post as a teacher at Henley House School in London, where he taught A. A. Milne (whose father ran the school). His first published work was a &quot;Text-Book of Biology&quot; in two volumes (1893).

Upon leaving the Normal School of Science, Wells was left without a source of income. His aunt Mary—his father&#x27;s sister-in-law—invited him to stay with her for a while, which solved his immediate problem of accommodation. During his stay at his aunt&#x27;s, he grew increasingly interested in her daughter, Isabel, whom he later courted and married. To earn money, he began writing short humorous articles for journals such as &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, later collecting these in &quot;Select Conversations with an Uncle&quot; (1895) and &quot;Certain Personal Matters&quot; (1897). So prolific did Wells become at this mode of journalism that many of his early pieces remain unidentified. According to David C. Smith, Most of Wells&#x27;s occasional pieces have not been collected, and many have not even been identified as his. Wells did not automatically receive the byline his reputation demanded until after 1896 or so . ... As a result, many of his early pieces are unknown. It is obvious that many early Wells items have been lost. His success with these shorter pieces encouraged him to write book-length work, and he published his first novel, &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, in 1895.

===Personal life===
In 1891, Wells married his cousin Isabel Mary Wells (1865–1931; from 1902 Isabel Mary Smith). The couple agreed to separate in 1894, when he had fallen in love with one of his students, Amy Catherine Robbins (1872–1927; later known as Jane), with whom he moved to Woking, Surrey, in May 1895. They lived in a rented house, &#x27;Lynton&#x27; (now No. 141), Maybury Road, in the town centre for just under 18 months and married at St Pancras register office in October 1895. His short period in Woking was perhaps the most creative and productive of his whole writing career; while there, he planned and wrote &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, completed &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot;, wrote and published &quot;The Wonderful Visit&quot; and &quot;The Wheels of Chance&quot;, and began writing two other early books, &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot; and &quot;Love and Mr Lewisham&quot;.

In late summer 1896, Wells and Jane moved to a larger house in Worcester Park, near Kingston upon Thames, for two years; this lasted until his poor health took them to Sandgate, near Folkestone, where he constructed a large family home, Spade House, in 1901. He had two sons with Jane: George Philip (known as &quot;Gip&quot;; 1901–1985) and Frank Richard (1903–1982) (grandfather of film director Simon Wells). Jane died on 6 October 1927, in Dunmow, at the age of 55, which left Wells devastated. She was cremated at Golders Green, with friends of the couple present including George Bernard Shaw.

Wells had multiple love affairs. Dorothy Richardson was a friend with whom he had a brief affair which led to a pregnancy and miscarriage, in 1907. Wells&#x27; wife had been a schoolmate of Richardson. In December 1909, he had a daughter, Anna-Jane, with the writer Amber Reeves, whose parents, William and Maud Pember Reeves, he had met through the Fabian Society. Amber had married the barrister G. R. Blanco White in July of that year, as co-arranged by Wells. After Beatrice Webb voiced disapproval of Wells&#x27;s &quot;sordid intrigue&quot; with Amber, he responded by lampooning Beatrice Webb and her husband Sidney Webb in his 1911 novel &quot;The New Machiavelli&quot; as &#x27;Altiora and Oscar Bailey&#x27;, a pair of short-sighted, bourgeois manipulators. Between 1910 and 1913, novelist Elizabeth von Arnim was one of his mistresses. In 1914, he had a son, Anthony West (1914–1987), by the novelist and feminist Rebecca West, 26 years his junior. In 1920–21, and intermittently until his death, he had a love affair with the American birth control activist Margaret Sanger.

Between 1924 and 1933, he partnered with the 22-year-younger Dutch adventurer and writer Odette Keun, with whom he lived in &quot;Lou Pidou&quot;, a house they built together in Grasse, France. Wells dedicated his longest book to her (&quot;The World of William Clissold&quot;, 1926). When visiting Maxim Gorky in Russia 1920, he had slept with Gorky&#x27;s mistress Moura Budberg, then still Countess Benckendorf and 27 years his junior. In 1933, when she left Gorky and emigrated to London, their relationship renewed and she cared for him through his final illness. Wells repeatedly asked her to marry him, but Budberg strongly rejected his proposals.

In &quot;Experiment in Autobiography&quot; (1934), Wells wrote: &quot;I was never a great amorist, though I have loved several people very deeply&quot;. David Lodge&#x27;s novel &quot;A Man of Parts&quot; (2011)a &#x27;narrative based on factual sources&#x27; (author&#x27;s note)gives a convincing and generally sympathetic account of Wells&#x27;s relations with the women mentioned above, and others.

===Artist===
One of the ways that Wells expressed himself was through his drawings and sketches. One common location for these was the endpapers and title pages of his own diaries, and they covered a wide variety of topics, from political commentary to his feelings toward his literary contemporaries and his current romantic interests. During his marriage to Amy Catherine, whom he nicknamed Jane, he drew a considerable number of pictures, many of them being overt comments on their marriage. During this period, he called these pictures &quot;picshuas&quot;. These picshuas have been the topic of study by Wells scholars for many years, and in 2006, a book was published on the subject.

===Writer===
Some of his early novels, called &quot;scientific romances&quot;, invented several themes now classic in science fiction in such works as &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot;, &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, and &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot;. He also wrote realistic novels that received critical acclaim, including &quot;Kipps&quot; and a critique of English culture during the Edwardian period, &quot;Tono-Bungay&quot;. Wells also wrote dozens of short stories and novellas, including, &quot;The Flowering of the Strange Orchid&quot;, which helped bring the full impact of Darwin&#x27;s revolutionary botanical ideas to a wider public, and was followed by many later successes such as &quot;The Country of the Blind&quot; (1904).

Writer James E. Gunn contended that one of Wells&#x27;s major contributions to the science fiction genre was his approach, referring to it as his &quot;new system of ideas&quot;. Gunn opined that an author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible, even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible, allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could really happen, today referred to as &quot;the plausible impossible&quot; and &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot;. While neither invisibility nor time travel was new in speculative fiction, Wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with. He conceived the idea of using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term &quot;time machine&quot;, coined by Wells, is almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle. He explained that while writing &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, he realized that &quot;the more impossible the story I had to tell, the more ordinary must be the setting, and the circumstances in which I now set the Time Traveller were all that I could imagine of solid upper-class comforts.&quot; In &quot;Wells&#x27;s Law&quot;, a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption. Therefore, as justifications for the impossible, he employed scientific ideas and theories. Wells&#x27;s best-known statement of the &quot;law&quot; appears in his introduction to a collection of his works published in 1934:

Dr. Griffin / The Invisible Man is a brilliant research scientist who discovers a method of invisibility, but finds himself unable to reverse the process. An enthusiast of random and irresponsible violence, Griffin has become an iconic character in horror fiction. &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot; sees a shipwrecked man left on the island home of Doctor Moreau, a mad scientist who creates human-like hybrid beings from animals via vivisection. The earliest depiction of uplift, the novel deals with a number of philosophical themes, including pain and cruelty, moral responsibility, human identity, and human interference with nature. In &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot; Wells used the idea of radio communication between astronomical objects, a plot point inspired by Nikola Tesla&#x27;s claim that he had received radio signals from Mars. In addition to science fiction, Wells produced work dealing with mythological beings like an angel in &quot;The Wonderful Visit&quot; (1895) and a mermaid in &quot;The Sea Lady&quot; (1902).

Though &quot;Tono-Bungay&quot; is not a science-fiction novel, radioactive decay plays a small but consequential role in it. Radioactive decay plays a much larger role in &quot;The World Set Free&quot; (1914), a book dedicated to Frederick Soddy who would receive a Nobel for proving the existence of radioactive isotopes. This book contains what is surely Wells&#x27;s biggest prophetic &quot;hit&quot;, with the first description of a nuclear weapon (which he termed &quot;atomic bombs&quot;). Scientists of the day were well aware that the natural decay of radium releases energy at a slow rate over thousands of years. The &quot;rate&quot; of release is too slow to have practical utility, but the &quot;total amount&quot; released is huge. Wells&#x27;s novel revolves around an (unspecified) invention that accelerates the process of radioactive decay, producing bombs that explode with no more than the force of ordinary high explosives—but which &quot;continue to explode&quot; for days on end. &quot;Nothing could have been more obvious to the people of the earlier twentieth century, than the rapidity with which war was becoming impossible ... [but] they did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands&quot;. In 1932, the physicist and conceiver of nuclear chain reaction Leó Szilárd read &quot;The World Set Free&quot; (the same year Sir James Chadwick discovered the neutron), a book which he wrote in his memoirs had made &quot;a very great impression on me&quot;. In 1934, Szilárd took his ideas for a chain reaction to the British War Office and later the Admiralty, assigning his patent to the Admiralty to keep the news from reaching the notice of the wider scientific community. He wrote, &quot;Knowing what this [a chain reaction] would mean—and I knew it because I had read H.G. Wells—I did not want this patent to become public.&quot;
Wells also wrote non-fiction. His first non-fiction bestseller was &quot;Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress upon Human Life and Thought&quot; (1901). When originally serialised in a magazine it was subtitled &quot;An Experiment in Prophecy&quot;, and is considered his most explicitly futuristic work. It offered the immediate political message of the privileged sections of society continuing to bar capable men from other classes from advancement until war would force a need to employ those most able, rather than the traditional upper classes, as leaders. Anticipating what the world would be like in the year 2000, the book is interesting both for its hits (trains and cars resulting in the dispersion of populations from cities to suburbs; moral restrictions declining as men and women seek greater sexual freedom; the defeat of German militarism, and the existence of a European Union) and its misses (he did not expect successful aircraft before 1950, and averred that &quot;my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea&quot;).

His bestselling two-volume work, &quot;The Outline of History&quot; (1920), began a new era of popularised world history. It received a mixed critical response from professional historians. However, it was very popular amongst the general population and made Wells a rich man. Many other authors followed with &quot;Outlines&quot; of their own in other subjects. He reprised his &quot;Outline&quot; in 1922 with a much shorter popular work, &quot;A Short History of the World&quot;, a history book praised by Albert Einstein, and two long efforts, &quot;The Science of Life&quot; (1930)—written with his son G. P. Wells and evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley, and &quot;The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind&quot; (1931). The &quot;Outlines&quot; became sufficiently common for James Thurber to parody the trend in his humorous essay, &quot;An Outline of Scientists&quot;—indeed, Wells&#x27;s &quot;Outline of History&quot; remains in print with a new 2005 edition, while &quot;A Short History of the World&quot; has been re-edited (2006).
From quite early in Wells&#x27;s career, he sought a better way to organise society and wrote a number of Utopian novels. The first of these was &quot;A Modern Utopia&quot; (1905), which shows a worldwide utopia with &quot;no imports but meteorites, and no exports at all&quot;; two travellers from our world fall into its alternate history. The others usually begin with the world rushing to catastrophe, until people realise a better way of living: whether by mysterious gases from a comet causing people to behave rationally and abandoning a European war (&quot;In the Days of the Comet&quot; (1906)), or a world council of scientists taking over, as in &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot; (1933, which he later adapted for the 1936 Alexander Korda film, &quot;Things to Come&quot;). This depicted, all too accurately, the impending World War, with cities being destroyed by aerial bombs. He also portrayed the rise of fascist dictators in &quot;The Autocracy of Mr Parham&quot; (1930) and &quot;The Holy Terror&quot; (1939). &quot;Men Like Gods&quot; (1923) is also a utopian novel. Wells in this period was regarded as an enormously influential figure; the literary critic Malcolm Cowley stated: &quot;by the time he was forty, his influence was wider than any other living English writer&quot;.

Wells contemplates the ideas of nature and nurture and questions humanity in books such as &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot;, where nature is completely suppressed by nurture, and &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot;, where the strong presence of nature represents a threat to a civilized society. Not all his scientific romances ended in a Utopia, and Wells also wrote a dystopian novel, &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot; (1899, rewritten as &quot;The Sleeper Awakes&quot;, 1910), which pictures a future society where the classes have become more and more separated, leading to a revolt of the masses against the rulers. &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot; is even darker. The narrator, having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected (unsuccessfully) into human beings, eventually returns to England; like Gulliver on his return from the Houyhnhnms, he finds himself unable to shake off the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts, slowly reverting to their animal natures.

Wells also wrote the preface for the first edition of W. N. P. Barbellion&#x27;s diaries, &quot;The Journal of a Disappointed Man&quot;, published in 1919. Since &quot;Barbellion&quot; was the real author&#x27;s pen name, many reviewers believed Wells to have been the true author of the &quot;Journal&quot;; Wells always denied this, despite being full of praise for the diaries.
In 1927, a Canadian teacher and writer Florence Deeks unsuccessfully sued Wells for infringement of copyright and breach of trust, claiming that much of &quot;The Outline of History&quot; had been plagiarised from her unpublished manuscript, &quot;The Web of the World&#x27;s Romance&quot;, which had spent nearly nine months in the hands of Wells&#x27;s Canadian publisher, Macmillan Canada. However, it was sworn on oath at the trial that the manuscript remained in Toronto in the safekeeping of Macmillan, and that Wells did not even know it existed, let alone seen it. The court found no proof of copying, and decided the similarities were due to the fact that the books had similar nature and both writers had access to the same sources. The case went on appeal from the Canadian courts to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the highest court of appeal for the British Empire, which dismissed the appeal in Deeks v Wells. In 2000, A. B. McKillop, a professor of history at Carleton University, produced a book on the case, &quot;The Spinster &amp; The Prophet: Florence Deeks, H.G. Wells, and the Mystery of the Purloined Past&quot;. According to McKillop, the lawsuit was unsuccessful due to the prejudice against a woman suing a well-known and famous male author, and he paints a detailed story based on the circumstantial evidence of the case. In 2004, Denis N. Magnusson, professor emeritus of the Faculty of Law, Queen&#x27;s University, Ontario, published an article on &quot;Deeks v. Wells&quot;. This re-examines the case in relation to McKillop&#x27;s book. While having some sympathy for Deeks, he argues that she had a weak case that was not well presented, and though she may have met with sexism from her lawyers, she received a fair trial, adding that the law applied is essentially the same law that would be applied to a similar case today (i.e., 2004).
In 1933, Wells predicted in &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot; that the world war he feared would begin in January 1940, a prediction which ultimately came true four months early, in September 1939, with the outbreak of World War II. In 1936, before the Royal Institution, Wells called for the compilation of a constantly growing and changing World Encyclopaedia, to be reviewed by outstanding authorities and made accessible to every human being. He also presented on his conception of a world encyclopedia at the World Congress of Universal Documentation in Paris in 1937.

In 1938, he published a collection of essays on the future organisation of knowledge and education, &quot;World Brain&quot;, including the essay &quot;The Idea of a Permanent World Encyclopaedia&quot;.

Prior to 1933, Wells&#x27;s books were widely read in Germany and Austria, and most of his science fiction works had been translated shortly after publication. By 1933, he had attracted the attention of German officials because of his criticism of the political situation in Germany, and on 10 May 1933, Wells&#x27;s books were burned by the Nazi youth in Berlin&#x27;s Opernplatz, and his works were banned from libraries and book stores. Wells, as president of PEN International (Poets, Essayists, Novelists), angered the Nazis by overseeing the expulsion of the German PEN club from the international body in 1934 following the German PEN&#x27;s refusal to admit non-Aryan writers to its membership. At a PEN conference in Ragusa, Wells refused to yield to Nazi sympathisers who demanded that the exiled author Ernst Toller be prevented from speaking. Near the end of World War II, Allied forces discovered that the SS had compiled lists of people slated for immediate arrest during the invasion of Britain in the abandoned Operation Sea Lion, with Wells included in the alphabetical list of &quot;The Black Book&quot;.

====Wartime works====

Seeking a more structured way to play war games, Wells wrote &quot;Floor Games&quot; (1911) followed by &quot;Little Wars&quot; (1913), which set out rules for fighting battles with toy soldiers (miniatures). A pacifist prior to the First World War, Wells stated &quot;how much better is this amiable miniature [war] than the real thing&quot;. According to Wells, the idea of the game developed from a visit by his friend Jerome K. Jerome. After dinner, Jerome began shooting down toy soldiers with a toy cannon and Wells joined in to compete.

During August 1914, immediately after the outbreak of the First World War, Wells published a number of articles in London newspapers that subsequently appeared as a book entitled &quot;The War That Will End War&quot;. He coined the expression with the idealistic belief that the result of the war would make a future conflict impossible. Wells blamed the Central Powers for the coming of the war and argued that only the defeat of German militarism could bring about an end to war. Wells used the shorter form of the phrase, &quot;the war to end war&quot;, in &quot;In the Fourth Year&quot; (1918), in which he noted that the phrase &quot;got into circulation&quot; in the second half of 1914. In fact, it had become one of the most common catchphrases of the war.

In 1918, Wells worked for the British War Propaganda Bureau, also called Wellington House. Wells was also one of fifty-three leading British authors — a number that included Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle — who signed their names to the &quot;Authors&#x27; Declaration.&quot; This manifesto declared that the German invasion of Belgium had been a brutal crime, and that Britain &quot;could not without dishonour have refused to take part in the present war&quot;.

===Travels to Russia and the Soviet Union===

Wells visited Russia three times: 1914, 1920 and 1934. After his visits to Petrograd and Moscow, in January 1914, he came back to England, &quot;a staunch Russophile&quot;. His views were recorded in a newspaper article, &quot;Russia and England: A Study on Contrasts&quot;, published in &quot;The Daily News&quot; on 1 February 1941, and in his novel &quot;Joan and Peter&quot; (1918). During his second visit, he saw his old friend Maxim Gorky and with Gorky&#x27;s help, met Vladimir Lenin. In his book &quot;Russia in the Shadows&quot;, Wells portrayed Russia as recovering from a total social collapse, &quot;the completest that has ever happened to any modern social organisation&quot;. On 23 July 1934, after visiting U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Wells went to the Soviet Union and interviewed Joseph Stalin for three hours for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine, which was extremely rare at that time. He told Stalin how he had seen &#x27;the happy faces of healthy people&#x27; in contrast with his previous visit to Moscow in 1920. However, he also criticised the lawlessness, class discrimination, state violence, and absence of free expression. Stalin enjoyed the conversation and replied accordingly. As the chairman of the London-based PEN International, which protected the rights of authors to write without being intimidated, Wells hoped by his trip to USSR, he could win Stalin over by force of argument. Before he left, he realised that no reform was to happen in the near future.

===Final years===

Wells&#x27;s greatest literary output occurred before the First World War, which was lamented by younger authors whom he had influenced. In this connection, George Orwell described Wells as &quot;too sane to understand the modern world&quot;, and &quot;since 1920 he has squandered his talents in slaying paper dragons.&quot; G. K. Chesterton quipped: &quot;Mr Wells is a born storyteller who has sold his birthright for a pot of message&quot;.

Wells had diabetes, and was a co-founder in 1934 of The Diabetic Association (now Diabetes UK, the leading charity for people with diabetes in the UK).

On 28 October 1940, on the radio station KTSA in San Antonio, Texas, Wells took part in a radio interview with Orson Welles, who two years previously had performed a famous radio adaptation of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. During the interview, by Charles C Shaw, a KTSA radio host, Wells admitted his surprise at the sensation that resulted from the broadcast but acknowledged his debt to Welles for increasing sales of one of his &quot;more obscure&quot; titles.

===Death===

Wells died on 13 August 1946, aged 79, at his home at 13 Hanover Terrace, overlooking Regent&#x27;s Park, London. In his preface to the 1941 edition of &quot;The War in the Air&quot;, Wells had stated that his epitaph should be: &quot;I told you so. You &quot;damned&quot; fools.&quot; Wells&#x27;s body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 16 August 1946; his ashes were subsequently scattered into the English Channel at Old Harry Rocks, the most eastern point of the Jurassic Coast and about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) from Swanage in Dorset.

A commemorative blue plaque in his honour was installed by the Greater London Council at his home in Regent&#x27;s Park in 1966.

==Futurist==

A futurist and &quot;visionary&quot;, Wells foresaw the advent of aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television, and something resembling the World Wide Web. Asserting that &quot;Wells&#x27;s visions of the future remain unsurpassed&quot;, John Higgs, author of &quot;Stranger Than We Can Imagine: Making Sense of the Twentieth Century&quot;, states that in the late 19th century Wells &quot;saw the coming century clearer than anyone else. He anticipated wars in the air, the sexual revolution, motorised transport causing the growth of suburbs and a proto-Wikipedia he called the &quot;world brain&quot;. In his novel &quot;The World Set Free&quot;, he imagined an &quot;atomic bomb&quot; of terrifying power that would be dropped from aeroplanes. This was an extraordinary insight for an author writing in 1913, and it made a deep impression on Winston Churchill.&quot;

In 2011, Wells was among a group of science fiction writers featured in the &quot;Prophets of Science Fiction&quot; series, a show produced and hosted by film director Sir Ridley Scott, which depicts how predictions influenced the development of scientific advancements by inspiring many readers to assist in transforming those futuristic visions into everyday reality. In a 2013 review of &quot;The Time Machine&quot; for the &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazine, Brad Leithauser writes, &quot;At the base of Wells&#x27;s great visionary exploit is this rational, ultimately scientific attempt to tease out the potential future consequences of present conditions—not as they might arise in a few years, or even decades, but millennia hence, epochs hence. He is world literature&#x27;s Great Extrapolator. Like no other fiction writer before him, he embraced &quot;deep time&quot;.

==Political views==

Wells was a socialist and a member of the Fabian Society. He stood as a Labour Party candidate for London University in the 1922 and 1923 general elections.

Winston Churchill was an avid reader of Wells&#x27;s books; after they first met in 1902, they kept in touch until Wells died in 1946. As a junior minister, Churchill borrowed lines from Wells for one of his most famous early landmark speeches in 1906; as Prime Minister, the phrase &quot;the gathering storm&quot;—used by Churchill to describe the rise of Nazi Germany—had been written by Wells in &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, which depicts an attack on Britain by Martians. Wells&#x27;s extensive writings on equality and human rights, most notably his most influential work, &quot;The Rights of Man&quot; (1940), laid the groundwork for the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations shortly after his death.

His efforts regarding the League of Nations, on which he collaborated on the project with Leonard Woolf with the booklets &quot;The Idea of a League of Nations&quot;, &quot;Prolegomena to the Study of World Organization&quot;, and &quot;The Way of the League of Nations&quot;, became a disappointment as the organization turned out to be a weak one unable to prevent the Second World War, which itself occurred towards the very end of his life and only increased the pessimistic side of his nature. In his last book &quot;Mind at the End of Its Tether&quot; (1945), he considered the idea that humanity being replaced by another species might not be a bad idea. He referred to the era between the two World Wars as &quot;The Age of Frustration&quot;.

Wells was initially an opponent of Zionism. In &quot;In the Days of the Comet&quot;, Jews are described as parasites on European society. However, Wells later became a strong supporter of the establishment of a Jewish state in response to the Holocaust.

He was a member of The Other Club, a London dining club.

==Religious views==
Wells&#x27; views on God and religion changed over his lifetime. Early in his life, he distanced himself from Christianity, and later from theism; finally, late in life, he was essentially atheistic. Martin Gardner summarises this progression:

In &quot;God the Invisible King&quot; (1917), Wells wrote that his idea of God did not draw upon the traditional religions of the world: Later in the work, he aligns himself with a &quot;renascent or modern religion ... neither atheist nor Buddhist nor Mohammedan nor Christian ... [that] he has found growing up in himself&quot;.

Of Christianity, he said: &quot;it is not now true for me. ... Every believing Christian is, I am sure, my spiritual brother ... but if systemically I called myself a Christian I feel that to most men I should imply too much and so tell a lie&quot;. Of other world religions, he writes: &quot;All these religions are true for me as Canterbury Cathedral is a true thing and as a Swiss chalet is a true thing. There they are, and they have served a purpose, they have worked. Only they are not true for me to live in them. ... They do not work for me&quot;. In &quot;The Fate of Homo Sapiens&quot; (1939), Wells criticised almost all world religions and philosophies, stating &quot;there is no creed, no way of living left in the world at all, that really meets the needs of the time... When we come to look at them coolly and dispassionately, all the main religions, patriotic, moral and customary systems in which human beings are sheltering today, appear to be in a state of jostling and mutually destructive movement, like the houses and palaces and other buildings of some vast, sprawling city overtaken by a landslide.&quot;

Wells&#x27;s opposition to organised religion reached a fever pitch in 1943 with publication of his book &quot;Crux Ansata&quot;, subtitled &quot;An Indictment of the Roman Catholic Church&quot; in which he attacked Catholicism, Pope Pius XII and called for the bombing of the city of Rome.

==Literary influence and legacy==

The science fiction historian John Clute describes Wells as &quot;the most important writer the genre has yet seen&quot;, and notes his work has been central to both British and American science fiction. Science fiction author and critic Algis Budrys said Wells &quot;remains the outstanding expositor of both the hope, and the despair, which are embodied in the technology and which are the major facts of life in our world&quot;. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1921, 1932, 1935, and 1946. Wells so influenced real exploration of space that impact craters on Mars and the Moon were named after him:


In the United Kingdom, Wells&#x27;s work was a key model for the British &quot;scientific romance&quot;, and other writers in that mode, such as Olaf Stapledon, J. D. Beresford, S. Fowler Wright, and Naomi Mitchison, all drew on Wells&#x27;s example. Wells was also an important influence on British science fiction of the period after the Second World War, with Arthur C. Clarke and Brian Aldiss expressing strong admiration for Wells&#x27;s work. A self-declared fan of Wells, John Wyndham, author of &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; and &quot;The Midwich Cuckoos&quot;, echoes Wells&#x27;s obsession with catastrophe and its aftermath. His early work (pre 1920) made Wells the literary hero of dystopian novelist George Orwell. Among contemporary British science fiction writers, Stephen Baxter, Christopher Priest and Adam Roberts have all acknowledged Wells&#x27;s influence on their writing; all three are vice-presidents of the H. G. Wells Society. He also had a strong influence on British scientist J. B. S. Haldane, who wrote &quot;Daedalus; or, Science and the Future&quot; (1924), &quot;The Last Judgement&quot; and &quot;On Being the Right Size&quot; from the essay collection &quot;Possible Worlds&quot; (1927), and &quot;Biological Possibilities for the Human Species in the Next Ten Thousand Years&quot; (1963), which are speculations about the future of human evolution and life on other planets. Haldane gave several lectures about these topics which in turn influenced other science fiction writers.
In the United States, Hugo Gernsback reprinted most of Wells&#x27;s work in the pulp magazine &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, regarding Wells&#x27;s work as &quot;texts of central importance to the self-conscious new genre&quot;. Later American writers such as Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, Frank Herbert, Carl Sagan, and Ursula K. Le Guin all recalled being influenced by Wells.

Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s early novels were strongly influenced by Wells&#x27;s realistic social novels, such as &quot;The History of Mr Polly&quot;; Lewis also named his first son Wells after the author. Lewis nominated H.G. Wells for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1932.

In an interview with &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, Vladimir Nabokov described Wells as his favourite writer when he was a boy and &quot;a great artist&quot;. He went on to cite &quot;The Passionate Friends&quot;, &quot;Ann Veronica&quot;, &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, and &quot;The Country of the Blind&quot; as superior to anything else written by Wells&#x27;s British contemporaries. Nabokov said: &quot;His sociological cogitations can be safely ignored, of course, but his romances and fantasies are superb.&quot;

Jorge Luis Borges wrote many short pieces on Wells in which he demonstrates a deep familiarity with much of Wells&#x27;s work. While Borges wrote several critical reviews, including a mostly negative review of Wells&#x27;s film &quot;Things to Come&quot;, he regularly treated Wells as a canonical figure of fantastic literature. Late in his life, Borges included &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; and &quot;The Time Machine&quot; in his &quot;Prologue to a Personal Library&quot;, a curated list of 100 great works of literature that he undertook at the behest of the Argentine publishing house Emecé. Wells also inspired writers of continental European speculative fiction such as Karel Čapek, Mikhail Bulgakov and Yevgeny Zamyatin.

In 2021, Wells was one of six British writers commemorated on a series of UK postage stamps issued by Royal Mail to celebrate British science fiction. Six classic science fiction novels were depicted, one from each author, with &quot;The Time Machine&quot; chosen to represent Wells.

==Representations==
===Literary===
* The superhuman protagonist of J. D. Beresford&#x27;s 1911 novel, &quot;The Hampdenshire Wonder&quot;, Victor Stott, was based on Wells.
* In M. P. Shiel&#x27;s short story &quot;The Primate of the Rose&quot; (1928), there is an unpleasant womaniser named E.P. Crooks, who was written as a parody of Wells. Wells had attacked Shiel&#x27;s &quot;Prince Zaleski&quot; when it was published in 1895, and this was Shiel&#x27;s response. Wells praised Shiel&#x27;s &quot;The Purple Cloud&quot; (1901); in turn Shiel expressed admiration for Wells, referring to him at a speech to the Horsham Rotary Club in 1933 as &quot;my friend Mr. Wells&quot;.
* In C. S. Lewis&#x27;s novel &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; (1945), the character Jules is a caricature of Wells, and much of Lewis&#x27;s science fiction was written both under the influence of Wells and as an antithesis to his work (or, as he put it, an &quot;exorcism&quot; of the influence it had on him).
* In Brian Aldiss&#x27;s novella &quot;The Saliva Tree&quot; (1966), Wells has a small off-screen guest role.
* In Saul Bellow&#x27;s novel &quot;Mr. Sammler&#x27;s Planet&quot; (1970), Wells is one of several historical figures the protagonist met when he was a young man.

<text>Hypertext is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices with references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can immediately access. Hypertext documents are interconnected by hyperlinks, which are typically activated by a mouse click, keypress set, or screen touch. Apart from text, the term &quot;hypertext&quot; is also sometimes used to describe tables, images, and other presentational content formats with integrated hyperlinks. Hypertext is one of the key underlying concepts of the World Wide Web, where Web pages are often written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). As implemented on the Web, hypertext enables the easy-to-use publication of information over the Internet.

==Etymology==

The English prefix &quot;hyper-&quot; comes from the Greek prefix &quot;ὑπερ-&quot; and means &quot;over&quot; or &quot;beyond&quot;; it has a common origin with the prefix &quot;super-&quot; which comes from Latin. It signifies the overcoming of the previous linear constraints of written text.

The term &quot;hypertext&quot; is often used where the term &quot;hypermedia&quot; might seem appropriate.

In 1992, author Ted Nelson – who coined both terms in 1963 – wrote:
==Types and uses of hypertext==
Hypertext documents can either be static (prepared and stored in advance) or dynamic (continually changing in response to user input, such as dynamic web pages). Static hypertext can be used to cross-reference collections of data in documents, software applications, or books on CDs. A well-constructed system can also incorporate other user-interface conventions, such as menus and command lines. Links used in a hypertext document usually replace the current piece of hypertext with the destination document. A lesser known feature is StretchText, which expands or contracts the content in place, thereby giving more control to the reader in determining the level of detail of the displayed document. Some implementations support transclusion, where text or other content is included by reference and automatically rendered in place.

Hypertext can be used to support very complex and dynamic systems of linking and cross-referencing. The most famous implementation of hypertext is the World Wide Web, written in the final months of 1990 and released on the Internet in 1991.

==History==
In 1941, Jorge Luis Borges published &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;, a short story that is often considered an inspiration for the concept of hypertext.

In 1945, Vannevar Bush wrote an article in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; called &quot;As We May Think&quot;, about a futuristic proto-hypertext device he called a Memex. A Memex would hypothetically store — and record — content on reels of microfilm, using electric photocells to read coded symbols recorded next to individual microfilm frames while the reels spun at high speed, and stopping on command. The coded symbols would enable the Memex to index, search, and link content to create and follow associative trails. Because the Memex was never implemented and could only link content in a relatively crude fashion — by creating chains of entire microfilm frames — the Memex is regarded only as a proto-hypertext device, but it is fundamental to the history of hypertext because it directly inspired the invention of hypertext by Ted Nelson and Douglas Engelbart.

In 1965, Ted Nelson coined the terms &#x27;hypertext&#x27; and &#x27;hypermedia&#x27; as part of a model he developed for creating and using linked content (first published reference 1965). He later worked with Andries van Dam to develop the Hypertext Editing System (text editing) in 1967 at Brown University. It was implemented using the terminal IBM 2250 with a light pen which was provided as a pointing device. By 1976, its successor FRESS was used in a poetry class in which students could browse a hyperlinked set of poems and discussion by experts, faculty and other students, in what was arguably the world&#x27;s first online scholarly community which van Dam says &quot;foreshadowed wikis, blogs and communal documents of all kinds&quot;. Ted Nelson said in the 1960s that he began implementation of a hypertext system he theorized, which was named Project Xanadu, but his first and incomplete public release was finished much later, in 1998.

Douglas Engelbart independently began working on his NLS system in 1962 at Stanford Research Institute, although delays in obtaining funding, personnel, and equipment meant that its key features were not completed until 1968. In December of that year, Engelbart demonstrated a &#x27;hypertext&#x27; (meaning editing) interface to the public for the first time, in what has come to be known as &quot;The Mother of All Demos&quot;.

In 1971 a system called Scrapbook, produced by David Yates and his team at the UK&#x27;s National Physical Laboratory, went live. It was an information storage and retrieval system that included what would now be called word processing, e-mail and hypertext.

ZOG, an early hypertext system, was developed at Carnegie Mellon University during the 1970s, used for documents on Nimitz class aircraft carriers, and later evolving as KMS (Knowledge Management System).

The first hypermedia application is generally considered to be the Aspen Movie Map, implemented in 1978. The Movie Map allowed users to arbitrarily choose which way they wished to drive in a virtual cityscape, in two seasons (from actual photographs) as well as 3-D polygons.

In 1980, Tim Berners-Lee created ENQUIRE, an early hypertext database system somewhat like a wiki but without hypertext punctuation, which was not invented until 1987. The early 1980s also saw a number of experimental &quot;hyperediting&quot; functions in word processors and hypermedia programs, many of whose features and terminology were later analogous to the World Wide Web. Guide, the first significant hypertext system for personal computers, was developed by Peter J. Brown at the University of Kent in 1982.

In 1980, Roberto Busa, an Italian Jesuit priest and one of the pioneers in the usage of computers for linguistic and literary analysis, published the &quot;Index Thomisticus&quot;, as a tool for performing text searches within the massive corpus of Aquinas&#x27;s works. Sponsored by the founder of IBM, Thomas J. Watson, the project lasted about 30 years (1949–1980), and eventually produced the 56 printed volumes of the &quot;Index Thomisticus&quot; the first important hypertext work about Saint Thomas Aquinas books and of a few related authors.

In 1983, Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland Human - Computer Interaction Lab led a group that developed the HyperTies system that was commercialized by Cognetics Corporation. They studied many designs before adopting the blue color for links. Hyperties was used to create the July 1988 issue of the Communications of the ACM as a hypertext document and then the first commercial electronic book &quot;Hypertext Hands-On!&quot;.

In August 1987, Apple Computer released HyperCard for the Macintosh line at the MacWorld convention. Its impact, combined with interest in Peter J. Brown&#x27;s GUIDE (marketed by OWL and released earlier that year) and Brown University&#x27;s Intermedia, led to broad interest in and enthusiasm for hypertext, hypermedia, databases, and new media in general. The first ACM Hypertext (hyperediting and databases) academic conference took place in November 1987, in Chapel Hill NC, where many other applications, including the branched literature writing software Storyspace, were also demonstrated.

Meanwhile, Nelson (who had been working on and advocating his Xanadu system for over two decades) convinced Autodesk to invest in his revolutionary ideas. The project continued at Autodesk for four years, but no product was released.

In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, then a scientist at CERN, proposed and later prototyped a new hypertext project in response to a request for a simple, immediate, information-sharing facility, to be used among physicists working at CERN and other academic institutions. He called the project &quot;WorldWideWeb&quot;.

In 1992, Lynx was born as an early Internet web browser. Its ability to provide hypertext links within documents that could reach into documents anywhere on the Internet began the creation of the Web on the Internet.

As new web browsers were released, traffic on the World Wide Web quickly exploded from only 500 known web servers in 1993 to over 10,000 in 1994. As a result, all previous hypertext systems were overshadowed by the success of the Web, even though it lacked many features of those earlier systems, such as integrated browsers/editors (a feature of the original WorldWideWeb browser, which was not carried over into most of the other early Web browsers).

==Implementations==
Besides the already mentioned Project Xanadu, Hypertext Editing System, NLS, HyperCard, and World Wide Web, there are other noteworthy early implementations of hypertext, with different feature sets:

* FRESS – a 1970s multi-user successor to the Hypertext Editing System.
* ZOG – a 1970s hypertext system developed at Carnegie Mellon University.
* Electronic Document System – an early 1980s text and graphic editor for interactive hypertexts such as equipment repair manuals and computer-aided instruction.
* Information Presentation Facility – used to display online help in IBM operating systems.
* Intermedia – a mid-1980s program for group web-authoring and information sharing.
* HyperTies - a mid-1980s program commercially applied to hundreds of projects, including July 1988 Communications of the ACM and Hypertext Hands-On! book.
* Texinfo – the GNU help system.
* KMS – a 1980s successor to ZOG developed as a commercial product.
* Storyspace – a mid-1980s program for hypertext narrative.
* Document Examiner - an hypertext system developed in 1985 at Symbolics for their Genera operating system.
* Adobe&#x27;s Portable Document Format – a widely used publication format for electronic documents.
* Amigaguide – released on the Commodore Amiga Workbench 1990.
* Windows Help – released with Windows 3.0 in 1990.
* Wikis – aim to compensate for the lack of integrated editors in most Web browsers. Various wiki software have slightly different conventions for formatting, usually simpler than HTML.
* PaperKiller – a document editor specifically designed for hypertext. Started in 1996 as IPer (educational project for ED-Media 1997).
* XML with the XLink extension – a newer hypertext markup language that extends and expands capabilities introduced by HTML.

==Academic conferences==
Among the top academic conferences for new research in hypertext is the annual ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media. The Electronic Literature Organization hosts annual conferences discussing hypertext fiction, poetry and other forms of electronic literature. Although not exclusively about hypertext, the World Wide Web series of conferences, organized by IW3C2, also include many papers of interest. There is a list on the Web with links to all conferences in the series.

==Hypertext fiction==
Hypertext writing has developed its own style of fiction, coinciding with the growth and proliferation of hypertext development software and the emergence of electronic networks. Hypertext fiction is one of earliest genres of electronic literature, or literary works that are designed to be read in digital media. Two software programs specifically designed for literary hypertext, &quot;Storyspace&quot; and Intermedia, became available in the 1990s. Judy Malloy&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Roger&quot; (1986) and Michael Joyce&#x27;s &quot;afternoon, a story&quot; (1987) are generally considered the first works of hypertext fiction.

An advantage of writing a narrative using hypertext technology is that the meaning of the story can be conveyed through a sense of spatiality and perspective that is arguably unique to digitally networked environments. An author&#x27;s creative use of nodes, the self-contained units of meaning in a hypertextual narrative, can play with the reader&#x27;s orientation and add meaning to the text.

One of the most successful computer games, &quot;Myst&quot;, was first written in HyperCard. The game was constructed as a series of Ages, each Age consisting of a separate HyperCard stack. The full stack of the game consists of over 2500 cards. In some ways, &quot;Myst&quot; redefined interactive fiction, using puzzles and exploration as a replacement for hypertextual narrative.

Critics of hypertext claim that it inhibits the old, linear, reader experience by creating several different tracks to read on. This can also been seen as contributing to a postmodernist fragmentation of worlds. In some cases, hypertext may be detrimental to the development of appealing stories (in the case of hypertext Gamebooks), where ease of linking fragments may lead to non-cohesive or incomprehensible narratives. However, they do see value in its ability to present several different views on the same subject in a simple way. This echoes the arguments of &#x27;medium theorists&#x27; like Marshall McLuhan who look at the social and psychological impacts of the media. New media can become so dominant in public culture that they effectively create a &quot;paradigm shift&quot; as people have shifted their perceptions, understanding of the world, and ways of interacting with the world and each other in relation to new technologies and media. So hypertext signifies a change from linear, structured and hierarchical forms of representing and understanding the world into fractured, decentralized and changeable media based on the technological concept of hypertext links.

In the 1990s, women and feminist artists took advantage of hypertext and produced dozens of works. Linda Dement&#x27;s &quot;Cyberflesh Girlmonster&quot; a hypertext CD-ROM that incorporates images of women&#x27;s body parts and remixes them to create new monstrous yet beautiful shapes. Caitlin Fisher&#x27;s award-winning online hypertext novella These Waves of Girls (2001) is set in three time periods of the protagonist exploring polymorphous perversity enacted in her queer identity through memory. The story is written as a reflection diary of the interconnected memories of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. It consists of an associated multi-modal collection of nodes includes linked text, still and moving images, manipulable images, animations, and sound clips. Adrienne Eisen (pen name for Penelope Trunk) wrote hypertexts that were subversive narrative journeys into the mind of a woman whose erotic encounters were charged with a post-feminist satirical edge that cuts deep into the American psyche.

===Forms===
There are various forms of hypertext fiction, each of which is structured differently. Below are four:
* Axial hypertext fiction has the simplest structure. Its hypertext is situated along a linear axis. With a straight path from beginning to end, it is fairly easy for the reader to follow. An example of an axial hypertext fiction is The Virtual Disappearance of Miriam.
* Arborescent hypertext fiction is more complex than the axial form. Its hypertext has a branching structure which resembles a tree, representing one beginning but many possible endings. The branches followed and ultimately the ending reached are determined by choices made by the reader at each branch point in the narrative. This is much like gamebook novels that allow readers to choose their own ending.
* Networked hypertext fiction is more complex than both axial and arborescent forms. It consists of an interconnected system of nodes with no dominant axis of orientation. Unlike the arborescent form, networked hypertexts do not have any designated beginning or any designated endings. An example of a networked hypertext is Shelley Jackson&#x27;s Patchwork Girl.
* Layered hypertext fiction consist of two layers of linked pages. Each layer is sequentially and a page in the top layer is doubly linked with a corresponding page in the bottom layer. The top layer contains plain text, the bottom multimedia layer provides photos, sounds and video. In the Dutch historical novel &quot;&quot; designed as layered hypertext in 2006 by Eisjen Schaaf, Pauline van de Ven, and Paul Vitányi, the structure is proposed to enhance the atmosphere of the time, to enrich the text with research and family archive material and to enable readers to insert memories of their own while preserving tension and storyline.

<doc id="13462" wikidata="Q311253" url="?curid=13462" title="Harlan Ellison">
<text>Harlan Jay Ellison (May 27, 1934 – June 28, 2018) was an American writer, known for his prolific and influential work in New Wave speculative fiction and for his outspoken, combative personality. His published works include more than 1,700 short stories, novellas, screenplays, comic book scripts, teleplays, essays, and a wide range of criticism covering literature, film, television, and print media. 

Some of his best-known works include the 1967 &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;, considered by some to be the single greatest episode of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise (he subsequently wrote a book about the experience that includes his original teleplay), his &quot;A Boy and His Dog&quot; cycle (which was made into a film), and his short stories &quot;I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream&quot; (later adapted by Ellison into a video game) and &quot;&#x27;Repent, Harlequin!&#x27; Said the Ticktockman&quot;. He was also editor and anthologist for &quot;Dangerous Visions&quot; (1967) and &quot;Again, Dangerous Visions&quot; (1972). Ellison won numerous awards, including multiple Hugos, Nebulas, and Edgars.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===

Ellison was born to a Jewish family in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 27, 1934, the son of Serita (née Rosenthal) and Louis Laverne Ellison, a dentist and jeweler. He had an older sister, Beverly (Rabnick), who was born in 1926. She died in 2010 without having spoken to him since their mother&#x27;s funeral in 1976. Some time after Beverly&#x27;s birth, his family moved to Painesville, Ohio, but returned to Cleveland in 1949, following his father&#x27;s death. Ellison frequently ran away from home (in an interview with Tom Snyder he would later claim it was due to discrimination by his high school peers), taking an array of odd jobs—including, by age 18, &quot;tuna fisherman off the coast of Galveston, itinerant crop-picker down in New Orleans, hired gun for a wealthy neurotic, nitroglycerine truck driver in North Carolina, cook, cab driver, lithographer, book salesman, in a department store, door-to-door brush salesman, and as a youngster, an actor in several productions at the Cleveland Play House&quot;. In 1947, a fan letter he wrote to &quot;Real Fact Comics&quot; became his first published writing.

Ellison attended Ohio State University for 18 months (1951–53) before being expelled. He said the expulsion was for hitting a professor, a certain Dr. Shedd, who had denigrated his writing ability. Over the next 20 or so years he sent that professor a copy of every story that he published.

Ellison published two serialized stories in the &quot;Cleveland News&quot; during 1949, and he sold a story to EC Comics early in the 1950s. During this period, Ellison was an active and visible member of science fiction fandom, and published his own science fiction fanzines, such as &quot;Dimensions&quot; (which had previously been the &quot;Bulletin of the Cleveland Science Fantasy Society&quot; for the Cleveland Science Fantasy Society, and later &quot;Science Fantasy Bulletin&quot;.)

Ellison moved to New York City in 1955 to pursue a writing career, primarily in science fiction. Over the next two years, he published more than 100 short stories and articles. The short stories collected as &quot;Sex Gang&quot; — which Ellison described in a 2012 interview as &quot;mainstream erotica&quot; — date from this period.

He served in the U.S. Army from 1957 to 1959. His first novel, &quot;Web of the City&quot;, was published during his military service in 1958, and he said that he had written the bulk of it while undergoing basic training at Fort Benning, Georgia. He served in the Public Information Office at Fort Knox, Kentucky, where he wrote articles and reviews for the post&#x27;s weekly newspaper.

After leaving the army, he relocated to Chicago, where he edited &quot;Rogue&quot; magazine.

===Hollywood and beyond===

Ellison moved to California in 1962 and began selling his writing to Hollywood. Ellison sold scripts to many television shows: &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; (4 episodes), &quot;Route 66,&quot; &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (2 episodes), &quot;Cimarron Strip&quot; and &quot;The Flying Nun&quot;.

Ellison&#x27;s screenplay for the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; is often considered the best of the 79 episodes in the series.

He co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Oscar&quot; (1966), starring Stephen Boyd and Tony Bennett.

In 1965, he participated in the second and third Selma to Montgomery marches, led by Martin Luther King Jr.

In 1966, in an article that &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine later named as the best magazine piece ever written, the journalist Gay Talese wrote a profile of Frank Sinatra. The article, entitled &quot;Frank Sinatra Has a Cold&quot;, briefly describes a verbal clash between Sinatra and Ellison, in which the crooner took exception to Ellison&#x27;s boots during a billiards game Ellison was playing with Omar Sharif, Leo Durocher and Peter Falk.

Ellison was hired as a writer for Walt Disney Studios, but was fired on his first day after Roy O. Disney overheard him in the studio commissary joking about making a pornographic animated film featuring Disney characters.

Ellison continued to publish short fiction and nonfiction pieces in various publications, including some of his best known stories. &quot;&#x27;Repent, Harlequin!&#x27; Said the Ticktockman&quot; (1965) is a celebration of civil disobedience against repressive authority. &quot;I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream&quot; (1967) is a story where five humans are tormented by an all-knowing computer throughout eternity. The story was the basis of a 1995 computer game; Ellison participated in the game&#x27;s design and provided the voice of the god-computer AM. Another story, &quot;A Boy and His Dog&quot;, examines the nature of friendship and love in a violent, post-apocalyptic world and was made into the 1975 film of the same name, starring Don Johnson.

In 1967, Ellison edited the &quot;Dangerous Visions&quot; collection, which attracted &quot;special citation at the 26th World SF Convention for editing &#x27;the most significant and controversial SF book published in 1967.&#x27;&quot; In his introduction Isaac Asimov described it epitomising a &quot;second revolution&quot; in Science Fiction as &quot;science receded and modern fictional techniques came to the fore.&quot; 

From 1968 to 1970, Ellison wrote a regular column on television for the &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot;. Titled &quot;The Glass Teat&quot;, Ellison&#x27;s column examined television&#x27;s impact on the politics and culture of the time, including its presentations of sex, politics, race, the Vietnam War, and violence. The essays were collected in two anthologies, &quot;The Glass Teat: Essays of Opinion on Television&quot; followed by &quot;The Other Glass Teat&quot;.

Ellison served as creative consultant to the 1980s version of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; science fiction TV series and &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. As a member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), he had voice-over credits for shows, including &quot;The Pirates of Dark Water&quot;, &quot;Mother Goose and Grimm&quot;, &quot;Space Cases&quot;, &quot;Phantom 2040&quot;, and &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, as well as making an onscreen appearance in the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; episode &quot;The Face of the Enemy&quot;.

A frequent guest on the Los Angeles science fiction/fantasy culture radio show &quot;Hour 25,&quot; hosted by Mike Hodel, Ellison took over as host when Hodel died. Ellison&#x27;s tenure was from May 1986 to June 1987.

Ellison&#x27;s short story &quot;The Man Who Rowed Christopher Columbus Ashore&quot; (1992) was selected for inclusion in the 1993 edition of &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot;.

Ellison as an audio actor/reader was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children twice and has won several Audie Awards.

In 2014, Ellison made a guest appearance on the album &quot;Finding Love in Hell&quot; by the stoner rock band Leaving Babylon, reading his piece &quot;The Silence&quot; (originally published in &quot;Mind Fields&quot;) as an introduction to the song &quot;Dead to Me.&quot;

Ellison&#x27;s official website, harlanellison.com, was launched in 1995 as a fan page; for several years, Ellison was a regular poster in its discussion forum.

Ellison&#x27;s voice is one of 80 used in the NPRmageddon podcast (which is unrelated to National Public Radio), which appeared after his death.

===Personal life and death===
Ellison married five times; each relationship ended within a few years, except the last. His first wife was Charlotte Stein, whom he married in 1956. They divorced in 1960, and he later described the marriage as &quot;four years of hell as sustained as the whine of a generator.&quot; Later that year he married Billie Joyce Sanders; they divorced in 1963. His 1966 marriage to Loretta Patrick lasted only seven weeks. In 1976, he married Lori Horowitz. He was 41 and she was 19, and he later said of the marriage, &quot;I was desperately in love with her, but it was a stupid marriage on my part.&quot; They were divorced after eight months. He briefly had a relationship with actress Grace Lee Whitney, allegedly ending it when he caught her smoking cannabis in his house. He and Susan Toth married in 1986, and they remained together, living in the Lost Aztec Temple of Mars in Sherman Oaks, until his death 32 years later. Susan died in August 2020, age 60.

Ellison described himself as a Jewish atheist.

In 1994, he had a heart attack and was hospitalized for quadruple coronary artery bypass surgery. From 2010, he received treatment for clinical depression.

In September 2007, Ellison attended the Midwestern debut of the documentary about his life, &quot;Dreams with Sharp Teeth&quot;, at the Cleveland Public Library in his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio. This would be Ellison&#x27;s last public appearance in his hometown.

On about October 10, 2014, Ellison had a stroke. Although his speech and cognition were unimpaired, he suffered paralysis on his right side, for which he was expected to spend several weeks in physical therapy before being released from the hospital.

Ellison died in his sleep at his home in Los Angeles on the morning of June 28, 2018. His literary estate is currently executed by &quot;Babylon 5&quot; creator J. Michael Straczynski.

==Pseudonyms==

Ellison on occasion used the pseudonym Cordwainer Bird to alert members of the public to situations in which he felt his creative contribution to a project had been mangled by others, beyond repair, typically Hollywood producers or studios (see also Alan Smithee). The first such work to which he signed the name was &quot;The Price of Doom&quot;, an episode of &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; (though it was misspelled as Cord Wainer Bird in the credits). An episode of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; (&quot;Who Killed Alex Debbs?&quot;) credited to Ellison contains a &quot;character&quot; given this name, played by Sammy Davis Jr.

The &quot;Cordwainer Bird&quot; moniker is a tribute to fellow science fiction writer Paul M. A. Linebarger, better known by his pen name, Cordwainer Smith. The origin of the word &quot;cordwainer&quot; is &quot;shoemaker&quot; (from working with shell cordovan leather for shoes). The term used by Linebarger was meant to imply the industriousness of the pulp author. Ellison said, in interviews and in his writing, that his version of the pseudonym was meant to mean &quot;a shoemaker for birds&quot;. Since he used the pseudonym mainly for works from which he wanted to distance himself, it may be understood to mean that &quot;this work is for the birds&quot; or that it is of as much use as shoes to a bird. Stephen King once said he thought that it meant that Ellison was giving people who mangled his work a literary version of &quot;the bird&quot; (given credence by Ellison himself in his own essay titled &quot;Somehow, I Don&#x27;t Think We&#x27;re in Kansas, Toto&quot;, describing his experience with the &quot;Starlost&quot; television series).

The Bird moniker became a character in one of Ellison&#x27;s own stories. In his 1978 book &quot;Strange Wine&quot;, Ellison explains the origins of the Bird and goes on to state that Philip José Farmer wrote Cordwainer into the Wold Newton family that the latter writer had developed. The thought of such a whimsical object lesson being related to such lights as Doc Savage, The Shadow, Tarzan, and all the other pulp heroes prompted Ellison to play with the concept, resulting in &quot;The New York Review of Bird&quot;, in which an annoyed Bird uncovers the darker secrets of the New York literary establishment before beginning a pulpish slaughter of the same.

Other pseudonyms Ellison used during his career include Jay Charby, Sley Harson, Ellis Hart, John Magnus, Paul Merchant, Pat Roeder, Ivar Jorgenson, Derry Tiger, Harlan Ellis and Jay Solo.

==Controversies and disputes==

===Temperament===
Ellison had a reputation for being abrasive and argumentative. He generally agreed with this assessment, and a dust jacket from one of his books described him as &quot;possibly the most contentious person on Earth.&quot; Ellison filed numerous grievances and attempted lawsuits; during a contract dispute with Signet/NAL Books binding cigarette ads into one of his paperbacks, he sent them dozens of bricks postage due, followed by a dead gopher. In an October 2017 piece in &quot;Wired&quot;, Ellison was dubbed &quot;Sci-Fi&#x27;s Most Controversial Figure.&quot;

At Stephen King&#x27;s request, Ellison provided a description of himself and his writing in &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; (1981): &quot;My work is foursquare for chaos. I spend my life personally, and my work professionally, keeping the soup boiling. is what they call you when you are no longer dangerous; I much prefer troublemaker, malcontent, desperado. I see myself as a combination of Zorro and Jiminy Cricket. My stories go out from here and raise hell. From time to time some denigrater or critic with umbrage will say of my work, &#x27;He only wrote that to shock.&#x27; I smile and nod. Precisely.&quot;

====Health issues====

Ellison suffered from health issues regularly through his life, including severe depression toward the end, some of which he believed was Epstein Barr/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. A few years before his death, Straczynski convinced him to seek psychiatric diagnosis for the depression, resulting in a diagnosis &amp; treatment of bipolar disorder; he commented, “Once you know he was bipolar, a lot of things that don’t make sense suddenly make sense.” The treatment &quot;had a salutary effect for a while, until the stroke hit&quot; Straczynski wrote a more detailed account of Ellison&#x27;s struggles with mental illness, published in the posthumous &quot;Last Dangerous Visions&quot;.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===
Ellison repeatedly criticized how &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator and producer Gene Roddenberry (and others) rewrote his original script for the 1967 episode &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;. Despite his objections, Ellison kept his own name on the shooting script instead of using &quot;Cordwainer Bird&quot; to indicate displeasure (see above).

Ellison&#x27;s original script was first published in the 1976 anthology &quot;Six Science Fiction Plays&quot;, edited by Roger Elwood. The aired version was adapted for the &quot;Star Trek&quot; Fotonovel series in 1977. In 1995, Borderlands Press published &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;, with nearly 300 pages, comprising an essay by Ellison, four versions of the teleplay, and eight &quot;Afterwords&quot; contributed by other parties. He greatly expanded the introduction for the paperback edition, in which he explained what he called a &quot;fatally inept&quot; treatment.

Both versions of the script won awards: Ellison&#x27;s original script won the 1968 Writers Guild Award for best episodic drama in television, while the shooting script won the 1968 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.

On March 13, 2009, Ellison sued CBS Paramount Television, seeking payment of 25% of net receipts from merchandising, publishing, and other income from the episode since 1967; the suit also names the Writers Guild of America for allegedly failing to act on Ellison&#x27;s behalf. On October 23, 2009, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine reported that a settlement had been reached.

===Vietnam War opposition and AggieCon I===
Ellison was among those who in 1968 signed an anti-Vietnam War advertisement in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;. In 1969, Ellison was Guest of Honor at Texas A&amp;M University&#x27;s first science fiction convention, AggieCon, where he reportedly referred to the university&#x27;s Corps of Cadets as &quot;America&#x27;s next generation of Nazis&quot;, inspired in part by the Vietnam War. Although the university was no longer solely a military school (from 1965), the student body was predominantly made up of cadet members. Between Ellison&#x27;s anti-military remarks and a food fight that broke out in the ballroom of the hotel where the gathering was held (although, according to Ellison in 2000, the food fight actually started in a Denny&#x27;s because the staff disappeared and they could not get their check), the school&#x27;s administration almost refused to approve the science fiction convention the next year and no guest of honor was invited for the next two AggieCons. Ellison was subsequently invited back as Guest of Honor for AggieCon V (1974).

===&quot;The Last Dangerous Visions&quot;===
&quot;The Last Dangerous Visions&quot; (TLDV), the third volume of Ellison&#x27;s anthology series, was originally announced for publication in 1973, but not published until October 2024, six years after Ellison died. Nearly 150 writers, many now also dead, had submitted works for the volume. In 1993, Ellison threatened to sue the New England Science Fiction Association (NESFA) for publishing &quot;Himself in Anachron&quot;, a short story written by Cordwainer Smith and originally sold by his widow to Ellison for the anthology. The NESFA later reached an amicable settlement after it was revealed that the story contract had expired, allowing them to legally acquire it for publication.

British science fiction author Christopher Priest criticized Ellison&#x27;s editorial practices in an article entitled &quot;The Book on the Edge of Forever&quot;, later expanded into a book. Priest documented a half-dozen unfulfilled promises by Ellison to publish &quot;TLDV&quot; within a year of the statement. Priest claims that he submitted a story at Ellison&#x27;s request, which Ellison retained for several months until Priest withdrew the story and demanded that Ellison return the manuscript. Ellison was incensed by &quot;The Book on the Edge of Forever&quot; and, personally or by proxy, threatened Priest on numerous occasions after its publication.

In November 2020, the executor of the Harlan Ellison estate, J. Michael Straczynski, announced on Patreon that he was proceeding with the final preparations for the publication of TLDV with the proceeds to go to the Harlan and Susan Ellison Trust. The book was expected to be published in April 2021, as significant publisher interest was expressed.

Christopher Priest was unimpressed, saying that Straczynski was &quot;in the same sort of unenviable position as Trump&#x27;s caddie&quot;, but as an experienced professional would possibly work something out. He added, &quot;I kind of lost interest in all that years ago. Ellison clearly did too, along with everyone else. (Although I gather he went on with his magical thinking if anyone asked when he was going to deliver.) Many of the stories were withdrawn, because Ellison acted like a dick. Of the ones that remain, most of them are by writers who are now deceased, so the rights have expired and the estates would have to be traced. A lot of the writers have disowned their stories as juvenilia, or outdated, or simply because Ellison was acting like a dick.&quot;

Despite early hopes of a 2021 release for TLDV, 2021 came and went with no book. An October 2021 &#x27;progress report&#x27; from Straczynski revealed that the book was still in preparation. On May 2, 2022, Straczynski announced that the book would be published in 2023. On July 10, 2022, Straczynski announced on Twitter that &quot;The Last Dangerous Visions&quot; will be published on September 1, 2024, by Blackstone Publishers. The book was finally published on October 1, 2024, after half a century.

===&quot;I, Robot&quot;===
Shortly after the release of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), Ben Roberts contacted Ellison to develop a script based on Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;I, Robot&quot; short story collection for Warner Bros.; Ellison and Asimov had been long-time friends, so Ellison may be presumed to have attached particular significance to the project. In a meeting with the Head of Production at Warners, Robert Shapiro, Ellison concluded that Shapiro was commenting on the script without having read it and accused him of having the &quot;intellectual and cranial capacity of an artichoke&quot;. Shortly afterwards, Ellison was dropped from the project. Without Ellison, the film came to a dead end, because subsequent scripts were unsatisfactory to potential directors. After a change in studio heads, Warner allowed Ellison&#x27;s script to be serialized in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; magazine and published in book form. The 2004 film &quot;I, Robot&quot;, starring Will Smith, has no connection to Ellison&#x27;s script.

===Allegations of assault on Charles Platt===
In 1985, Ellison allegedly publicly assaulted author, journalist and computer programmer Charles Platt at the Nebula Awards banquet. Platt did not pursue legal action against Ellison and the two men later signed a &quot;non-aggression pact&quot;, promising never to discuss the incident again nor to have any contact with one another. Platt claims that Ellison often publicly boasted about the incident.

===Support of Ed Kramer===
Ellison voiced strong support for Ed Kramer, founder of Dragon Con, after Kramer was accused of sexual abuse of children in 2000. Ellison and others disputed the evidence against Kramer, and also alleged Kramer was being held in jail in violation of his right to a speedy trial.

When writer Nancy A. Collins spoke up against Kramer, Ellison led a long-standing feud against her before Kramer entered an Alford plea in 2013.

===2006 Hugo Awards ceremony===
Ellison was presented with a special committee award at the 2006 Hugo Awards ceremony. When Ellison got to the podium, presenter Connie Willis asked him &quot;Are you going to be good?&quot; When she asked the question a second time, Ellison put the microphone in his mouth, to the crowd&#x27;s laughter. He then placed his hand on her breast during an embrace. Ellison subsequently complained that Willis refused to acknowledge his apology.

===Lawsuit against Fantagraphics===
On September 20, 2006, Ellison sued comic book and magazine publisher Fantagraphics, stating they had defamed him in their book &quot;Comics As Art (We Told You So)&quot;. The book recounts the history of Fantagraphics and discussed a lawsuit that resulted from a 1980 Ellison interview with Fantagraphics&#x27; industry news magazine, &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;. In this interview Ellison referred to comic book writer Michael Fleisher, calling him &quot;bugfuck&quot; and &quot;derange-o&quot;. Fleisher lost his libel suit against Ellison and Fantagraphics on December 9, 1986.

Ellison, after reading unpublished drafts of the book on Fantagraphics&#x27;s website, believed that he had been defamed by several anecdotes related to this incident. He sued in the Superior Court for the State of California, in Santa Monica. Fantagraphics attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed. In their motion to dismiss, Fantagraphics argued that the statements were both their personal opinions and generally believed to be true anecdotes. On February 12, 2007, the presiding judge ruled against Fantagraphics&#x27; anti-SLAPP motion for dismissal. On June 29, 2007, Ellison claimed that the litigation had been resolved pending Fantagraphics&#x27; removal of all references to the case from their website. No money or apologies changed hands in the settlement as posted on August 17, 2007.

===Copyright suits===
In a 1980 lawsuit against ABC and Paramount Pictures, Ellison and Ben Bova claimed that the TV series &quot;Future Cop&quot; was based on their short story &quot;Brillo&quot;, winning a $337,000 judgement.

Ellison alleged that James Cameron&#x27;s film &quot;The Terminator&quot; drew from material from an episode of the original &quot;Outer Limits&quot; which Ellison had scripted, &quot;Soldier&quot; (1964). Hemdale, the production company and the distributor Orion Pictures, settled out of court for an undisclosed sum and added a credit to the film which acknowledged Ellison&#x27;s work. Cameron objected to this acknowledgement and has since labeled Ellison&#x27;s claim a &quot;nuisance suit&quot;. Some accounts of the settlement state that another &quot;Outer Limits&quot; episode written by Ellison, &quot;Demon with a Glass Hand&quot; (1964), was also claimed to have been plagiarized by the film, but Ellison stated that &quot;&quot;Terminator&quot; was not stolen from &#x27;Demon with a Glass Hand,&#x27; it was a ripoff of my OTHER Outer Limits script, &#x27;Soldier.

In 1983, Marvel Comics released &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #286, entitled &quot;Hero&quot;, written by Bill Mantlo. Three issues later, Marvel put up a letter claiming that Mantlo adapted &quot;Soldier&quot; for use as a Hulk story, but they forgot to credit Ellison and it was pointed out by readers. In actuality, then-Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter signed off on the story, not having seen the &quot;Outer Limits&quot; episode it was based on and not realizing Mantlo copied it wholesale. The day the issue went to stands, he was contacted by an angry Ellison, who calmed down after Shooter admitted the error. Although he could have claimed hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages, Ellison only requested the same payment Mantlo got for the story, writer&#x27;s credit and a lifetime subscription to everything Marvel published.

On April 24, 2000, Ellison sued Stephen Robertson for posting four stories to the usenet newsgroup &quot;alt.binaries.e-book&quot; without authorization. The other defendants were AOL and RemarQ, an internet service provider who owned servers hosting the newsgroup. Ellison alleged they had failed to halt copyright infringement in accordance with the &quot;Notice and Takedown Procedure&quot; outlined in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Robertson and RemarQ first settled with Ellison, and then AOL likewise settled with Ellison in June 2004, under conditions that were not made public. Since those settlements Ellison initiated legal action or takedown notices against more than 240 people who have allegedly distributed his writings on the Internet, saying, &quot;If you put your hand in my pocket, you&#x27;ll drag back six inches of bloody stump&quot;.

==Works==
==Awards==
Ellison won eight Hugo Awards, a shared award for the screenplay of &quot;A Boy and his Dog&quot; that he counted as &quot;half a Hugo&quot;, and two special awards from annual World SF Conventions; four Nebula Awards of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA); five Bram Stoker Awards of the Horror Writers Association (HWA); two Edgar Awards of the Mystery Writers of America; two World Fantasy Awards from annual conventions; and two Georges Méliès fantasy film awards. In 1987, Ellison was awarded the Inkpot Award.

In his 1981 book about the horror genre, &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, Stephen King reviewed Ellison&#x27;s collection &quot;Strange Wine&quot; and considered it one of the best horror books published between 1950 and 1980.

Ellison won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 1993. HWA gave him its Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996 and the World Horror Convention named him Grand Master in 2000. He was awarded the Gallun Award for Lifetime Achievement in Science Fiction from I-CON in 1997.

SFWA named him its 23rd Grand Master of fantasy and science fiction in 2006 and the Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted him in 2011. That year he also received the fourth J. Lloyd Eaton Lifetime Achievement Award in Science Fiction, presented by the UCR Libraries at the 2011 Eaton SF Conference, &quot;Global Science Fiction&quot;.

, Ellison is the only three-time winner of the Nebula Award for Best Short Story. He won his other Nebula in the novella category.

He was awarded the Silver Pen for Journalism by International PEN, the international writers&#x27; union, in 1982. In 1990, Ellison was honored by International PEN for continuing commitment to artistic freedom and the battle against censorship. In 1998, he was awarded the &quot;Defender of Liberty&quot; award by the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund.

In March 1998, the National Women&#x27;s Committee of Brandeis University honored him with their 1998 Words, Wit, Wisdom award.

Ellison was named 2002&#x27;s winner of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal&#x27;s &quot;Distinguished Skeptic Award&quot;, in recognition of his contributions to science and critical thinking. Ellison was presented with the award at the Skeptics Convention in Burbank, California, on June 22, 2002.

In December 2009, Ellison was nominated for a Grammy award in the category Best Spoken Word Album For Children for his reading of &quot;Through the Looking-Glass And What Alice Found There&quot; for Blackstone Audio, Inc.

==Parodies and pastiches of Ellison==
In the 1970s artist and cartoonist Gordon Carleton wrote and drew a scripted slideshow called &quot;City on the Edge of Whatever&quot;, which was a spoof of &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;. Occasionally performed at &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions, it features an irate writer named &quot;Arlan Hellison&quot; who screams at his producers, &quot;Art defilers! Script assassins!&quot;

&quot;Justice League of America&quot; #89 (&quot;The Most Dangerous Dreams Of All&quot;) 1971, written by Mike Friedrich, is centered around a character named Harlequin Ellis. The character is smitten with Black Canary, and injects himself into Justice League adventures, taking on the role of different heroes in his attempts to woo her. Ellison himself had written several comic book scripts.

Ben Bova&#x27;s novel &quot;The Starcrossed&quot; (1975), a &quot;roman à clef&quot; about Bova and Ellison&#x27;s experience on &quot;The Starlost&quot; TV series, features a character &quot;Ron Gabriel&quot; who is a pastiche of Ellison. Bova&#x27;s novel is dedicated to Ellison&#x27;s pseudonym &quot;Cordwainer Bird&quot;, who was credited as series creator on &quot;The Starlost&quot; per Ellison&#x27;s demand. In the novel, &quot;Ron Gabriel&quot; requires the fictional series producers to credit him under the pseudonym &quot;Victor Lawrence Talbot Frankenstein&quot;.

In &quot;Murder at the ABA&quot; (1976) by Isaac Asimov, the protagonist, Darius Just, was based on Ellison, as stated by Asimov in footnotes to the book itself, and in his autobiographical volume &quot;In Joy Still Felt&quot;.

Robert Silverberg named a character in his first novel, &quot;Revolt on Alpha C&quot; (1955), for Ellison, who was Silverberg&#x27;s neighbor in New York City at the time he was writing the book. This was confirmed in a special edition on the occasion of Silverberg&#x27;s 35th year in the business.

Sharyn McCrumb&#x27;s mystery novel &quot;Bimbos of the Death Sun&quot; (1987) featured a cantankerous antagonist-turned-murder victim based on Ellison. Fans of Ellison sent him copies of the book, and upon meeting Ellison later that year at the Edgar Awards, Ellison told McCrumb he had read the book and thought it was good.

Ellison is a recurring minor character in the animated television series &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot; (2010–2013), voicing a fictionalized version of himself modeled on his appearance in the 1970s.

Ellison appeared as himself in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;Married to the Blob&quot;, 2014) in which he meets Bart and Milhouse, and parodies his contention that the film &quot;The Terminator&quot; used ideas from his stories.

<text>Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi (; 1609 – 1640) was an Ottoman scientist, inventor, chemist, astronomer, physician, Andalusi musician, and poet from Istanbul, reported in the writings of traveler Evliya Çelebi to have achieved sustained unpowered flight.

==Etymology of name==
The title &quot;Hezârfen&quot;, given by Evliyâ Çelebi to Ahmed Çelebi, is from Persian هزار &quot;hezār&quot; meaning -a thousand- + فنّ &quot;fann&quot; meaning -science together making it together Ahmed having talents in &quot;a thousand of sciences (polymath).

==Non-powered flight==
The 17th century writings of Evliyâ Çelebi relate this story of Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi, circa 1630–1632:

==Legacy==
*One of 4 airports in Istanbul is named the &quot;Hezarfen Airfield&quot;.
*A 1996 feature-length film, &quot;Istanbul Beneath My Wings&quot; (&quot;İstanbul Kanatlarımın Altında&quot;) concerns the lives of Hezârfen Ahmet Çelebi, his brother and purported rocket aviator Lagari Hasan Çelebi (per the same single source, Çelebi, as the above story), and Ottoman society in the early 17th century, as witnessed and narrated by Evliya Çelebi.
*The Turkish children’s TV show “Little Hezarfen” (&quot;Küçük Hezarfen&quot;) is about Hezârfen Ahmet Çelebi&#x27;s childhood, though the events that occur within the show are likely fictitious and/or exaggerated. A main theme within the show, however, is Hezarfen&#x27;s desire to build wings that allow him to fly.

<text>Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt (June 2, 1885 – December 30, 1964) was a German neurologist and neuropathologist. Although he is typically credited as the physician to first describe the Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, this has been disputed. He was born in Harburg an der Elbe and died in Munich.

==Biography==
Creutzfeldt was born into a medical family, on June 2, 1885, at Harburg an der Elbe, Germany, which was incorporated into Hamburg in 1937. In 1903, at the age of 18, he was drafted into the German army and spent his service stationed in Kiel.

Afterwards, he attended the School of Medicine of the University of Jena and the University of Rostock, receiving his doctorate at the latter in 1909. Part of his practical training was undertaken at &quot;St. Georg&quot; – Hospital in Hamburg. After qualification he sought adventure as a ship&#x27;s surgeon, voyaging the Pacific Ocean, taking the opportunity to study local crafts, linguistics, and tropical plants.

After returning to Germany in 1912, Creutzfeldt worked at the Neurological Institute in Frankfurt am Main, at the psychiatric-neurological clinics in Breslau, Kiel and Berlin, and at the &quot;Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Psychiatrie&quot; in Munich. 

During the First World War, Creutzfeldt was deployed as a reserve medical officer and survived the sinking of the auxiliary cruiser SMS Greif, on which he was embarked. After being captured on February 29, 1916, he was repatriated as a doctor in May of that year and served in the Imperial German Navy until the end of the war in 1918.

Creutzfeldt was habilitated at Kiel in 1920, and in 1925 became &quot;Extraordinarius&quot; of psychiatry and neurology. In 1938 he was appointed professor and director of the university psychiatric and neurological division in Kiel. He helped to recognize a neurodegenerative disease, with Alfons Maria Jakob, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease in which the brain tissue develops holes and takes on a sponge-like texture. It is now known it is due to a type of infectious protein called a prion. Prions are misfolded proteins which replicate by converting their properly folded counterparts.

In Nazi Germany, Creutzfeldt became a Patron Member of Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s SS from 1932 to 1933.

==Later life==
Creutzfeldt was 54 years old when the Second World War broke out. He was unmoved by the Nazi regime and was able to save some people from death in concentration camps and also managed to save almost all of his patients from being murdered under the Nazi &quot;Aktion T4&quot; involuntary euthanasia program, while most mental patients identified by T4 personnel were gassed or poisoned at separate euthanasia clinics such as Hadamar Euthanasia Centre. During the war, bombing raids destroyed his home and clinic.

After the war he was director of the University of Kiel for six months, before being dismissed by the British occupation forces. His efforts to rebuild the university caused a series of conflicts with the British because he wanted to allow more former army officers to study there. Creutzfeldt resigned from his work at Kiel in 1953 in order to pursue life as professor emeritus in Munich.

==Personal life==
He was married to Clara Sombart, a daughter of economist Werner Sombart. They had five children, among them neurologist Otto Detlev Creutzfeldt and Werner Creutzfeldt (1924–2006), a German internist. He died in December 1964 in Munich.

<doc id="13465" wikidata="Q1846" url="?curid=13465" title="Holmium">
<text>Holmium is a chemical element; it has symbol Ho and atomic number 67. It is a rare-earth element and the eleventh member of the lanthanide series. It is a relatively soft, silvery, fairly corrosion-resistant and malleable metal. Like many other lanthanides, holmium is too reactive to be found in native form, as pure holmium slowly forms a yellowish oxide coating when exposed to air. When isolated, holmium is relatively stable in dry air at room temperature. However, it reacts with water and corrodes readily, and also burns in air when heated.

In nature, holmium occurs together with the other rare-earth metals (like thulium). It is a relatively rare lanthanide, making up 1.4 parts per million of the Earth&#x27;s crust, an abundance similar to tungsten. Holmium was discovered through isolation by Swedish chemist Per Theodor Cleve. It was also independently discovered by Jacques-Louis Soret and Marc Delafontaine, who together observed it spectroscopically in 1878. Its oxide was first isolated from rare-earth ores by Cleve in 1878. The element&#x27;s name comes from &quot;Holmia&quot;, the Latin name for the city of Stockholm.

Like many other lanthanides, holmium is found in the minerals monazite and gadolinite and is usually commercially extracted from monazite using ion-exchange techniques. Its compounds in nature and in nearly all of its laboratory chemistry are trivalently oxidized, containing Ho(III) ions. Trivalent holmium ions have fluorescent properties similar to many other rare-earth ions (while yielding their own set of unique emission light lines), and thus are used in the same way as some other rare earths in certain laser and glass-colorant applications.

Holmium has the highest magnetic permeability and magnetic saturation of any element and is thus used for the pole pieces of the strongest static magnets. Because holmium strongly absorbs neutrons, it is also used as a burnable poison in nuclear reactors.

==Properties==

Holmium is the eleventh member of the lanthanide series. In the periodic table, it appears in period 6, between the lanthanides dysprosium to its left and erbium to its right, and above the actinide einsteinium.

===Physical properties===

With a boiling point of , holmium is the sixth most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium, europium, samarium, thulium and dysprosium. At standard temperature and pressure, holmium, like many of the second half of the lanthanides, normally assumes a hexagonally close-packed (hcp) structure. Its 67 electrons are arranged in the configuration [Xe] 4f11 6s2, so that it has thirteen valence electrons filling the 4f and 6s subshells.

Holmium, like all of the lanthanides, is paramagnetic at standard temperature and pressure. However, holmium is ferromagnetic at temperatures below . It has the highest magnetic moment () of any naturally occurring element and possesses other unusual magnetic properties. When combined with yttrium, it forms highly magnetic compounds.

===Chemical properties===

Holmium metal tarnishes slowly in air, forming a yellowish oxide layer that has an appearance similar to that of iron rust. It burns readily to form holmium(III) oxide:

:4 Ho + 3 O2 → 2 Ho2O3

It is a relatively soft and malleable element that is fairly corrosion-resistant and chemically stable in dry air at standard temperature and pressure. In moist air and at higher temperatures, however, it quickly oxidizes, forming a yellowish oxide. In pure form, holmium possesses a metallic, bright silvery luster.

Holmium is quite electropositive: on the Pauling electronegativity scale, it has an electronegativity of 1.23. It is generally trivalent. It reacts slowly with cold water and quickly with hot water to form holmium(III) hydroxide:
:2 Ho (s) + 6 H2O (l) → 2 Ho(OH)3 (aq) + 3 H2 (g)

Holmium metal reacts with all the stable halogens:
:2 Ho (s) + 3 F2 (g) → 2 HoF3 (s) [pink]

:2 Ho (s) + 3 Cl2 (g) → 2 HoCl3 (s) [yellow]

:2 Ho (s) + 3 Br2 (g) → 2 HoBr3 (s) [yellow]

:2 Ho (s) + 3 I2 (g) → 2 HoI3 (s) [yellow]

Holmium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the yellow Ho(III) ions, which exist as a [Ho(OH2)9]3+ complexes:

:2 Ho (s) + 3 H2SO4 (aq) → 2 Ho3+ (aq) + 3 (aq) + 3 H2 (g)

====Oxidation states====
As with many lanthanides, holmium is usually found in the +3 oxidation state, forming compounds such as holmium(III) fluoride (HoF3) and holmium(III) chloride (HoCl3). Holmium in solution is in the form of Ho3+ surrounded by nine molecules of water. Holmium dissolves in acids. However, holmium is also found to exist in +2, +1 and 0 oxidation states.

===Isotopes===
The isotopes of holmium range from 140Ho to 175Ho. The primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 165Ho, is positron emission, and the primary mode after is beta minus decay. The primary decay products before 165Ho are terbium and dysprosium isotopes, and the primary products after are erbium isotopes.

Natural holmium consists of one primordial isotope, holmium-165; it is the only isotope of holmium that is thought to be stable, although it is predicted to undergo alpha decay to terbium-161 with a very long half-life. Of the 35 synthetic radioactive isotopes that are known, the most stable one is holmium-163 (163Ho), with a half-life of 4570 years. All other radioisotopes have ground-state half-lives not greater than 1.117 days, with the longest, holmium-166 (166Ho) having a half-life of 26.83 hours, and most have half-lives under 3 hours.

166m1Ho has a half-life of around 1200 years. The high excitation energy, resulting in a particularly rich spectrum of decay gamma rays produced when the metastable state de-excites, makes this isotope useful as a means for calibrating gamma ray spectrometers.

== Compounds ==

=== Oxides and chalcogenides ===

Holmium(III) oxide is the only oxide of holmium. It changes its color depending on the lighting conditions. In daylight, it has a yellowish color. Under trichromatic light, it appears orange red, almost indistinguishable from the appearance of erbium oxide under the same lighting conditions. The color change is related to the sharp emission lines of trivalent holmium ions acting as red phosphors. Holmium(III) oxide appears pink under a cold-cathode fluorescent lamp.

Other chalcogenides are known for holmium. Holmium(III) sulfide has orange-yellow crystals in the monoclinic crystal system, with the space group &quot;P&quot;21/&quot;m&quot; (No. 11). Under high pressure, holmium(III) sulfide can form in the cubic and orthorhombic crystal systems. It can be obtained by the reaction of holmium(III) oxide and hydrogen sulfide at . Holmium(III) selenide is also known. It is antiferromagnetic below 6 K.

=== Halides ===

All four trihalides of holmium are known. Holmium(III) fluoride is a yellowish powder that can be produced by reacting holmium(III) oxide and ammonium fluoride, then crystallising it from the ammonium salt formed in solution. Holmium(III) chloride can be prepared in a similar way, with ammonium chloride instead of ammonium fluoride. It has the YCl3 layer structure in the solid state. These compounds, as well as holmium(III) bromide and holmium(III) iodide, can be obtained by the direct reaction of the elements:

:2 Ho + 3 X2 → 2 HoX3

In addition, holmium(III) iodide can be obtained by the direct reaction of holmium and mercury(II) iodide, then removing the mercury by distillation.

===Organoholmium compounds===

Organoholmium compounds are very similar to those of the other lanthanides, as they all share an inability to undergo π backbonding. They are thus mostly restricted to the mostly ionic cyclopentadienides (isostructural with those of lanthanum) and the σ-bonded simple alkyls and aryls, some of which may be polymeric.

==History==

Holmium (, Latin name for Stockholm) was discovered by the Swiss chemists Jacques-Louis Soret and Marc Delafontaine in 1878 who noticed the aberrant spectrographic emission spectrum of the then-unknown element (they called it &quot;Element X&quot;).

The Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve also independently discovered the element while he was working on erbia earth (erbium oxide). He was the first to isolate impure oxide of the new element. Using the method developed by the Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander, Cleve first removed all of the known contaminants from erbia. The result of that effort was two new materials, one brown and one green. He named the brown substance &quot;holmia&quot; (after the Latin name for Cleve&#x27;s home town, Stockholm) and the green one &quot;thulia&quot;. &quot;Holmia&quot; was later found to be the holmium oxide, and &quot;thulia&quot; was thulium oxide. The pure oxide was only isolated in 1911 and the metal in 1939 by Heinrich Bommer.

In the English physicist Henry Moseley&#x27;s classic paper on atomic numbers, holmium was assigned the value 66. The holmium preparation he had been given to investigate had been impure, dominated by neighboring dysprosium. He would have seen x-ray emission lines for both elements, but assumed that the dominant ones belonged to holmium, instead of the dysprosium impurity.

==Occurrence and production==

Like all the other rare-earth elements, holmium is not naturally found as a free element. It occurs combined with other elements in gadolinite, monazite and other rare-earth minerals. No holmium-dominant mineral has yet been found. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka, and Australia with reserves of holmium estimated as 400,000 tonnes. The annual production of holmium metal is of about 10 tonnes per year.

Holmium makes up 1.3 parts per million of the Earth&#x27;s crust by mass. Holmium makes up 1 part per million of the soils, 400 parts per quadrillion of seawater, and almost none of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, which is very rare for a lanthanide. It makes up 500 parts per trillion of the universe by mass.

Holmium is commercially extracted by ion exchange from monazite sand (0.05% holmium), but is still difficult to separate from other rare earths. The element has been isolated through the reduction of its anhydrous chloride or fluoride with metallic calcium. Its estimated abundance in the Earth&#x27;s crust is 1.3 mg/kg. Holmium obeys the Oddo–Harkins rule: as an odd-numbered element, it is less abundant than both dysprosium and erbium. However, it is the most abundant of the odd-numbered heavy lanthanides. Of the lanthanides, only promethium, thulium, lutetium and terbium are less abundant on Earth. The principal current source are some of the ion-adsorption clays of southern China. Some of these have a rare-earth composition similar to that found in xenotime or gadolinite. Yttrium makes up about two-thirds of the total by mass; holmium is around 1.5%. Holmium is relatively inexpensive for a rare-earth metal with the price about 1000 USD/kg.

==Applications==
Glass containing holmium oxide and holmium oxide solutions (usually in perchloric acid) have sharp optical absorption peaks in the spectral range 200 to 900 nm. They are therefore used as a calibration standard for optical spectrophotometers. The radioactive but long-lived 166m1Ho is used in calibration of gamma-ray spectrometers.

Holmium is used to create the strongest artificially generated magnetic fields, when placed within high-strength magnets as a magnetic pole piece (also called a magnetic flux concentrator). Holmium is also used in the manufacture of some permanent magnets.

Holmium-doped yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and yttrium lithium fluoride have applications in solid-state lasers, and Ho-YIG has applications in optical isolators and in microwave equipment (e.g., YIG spheres). Holmium lasers emit at 2.1 micrometres. They are used in medical, dental, and fiber-optical applications. It is also being considered for usage in the enucleation of the prostate.

Since holmium can absorb nuclear fission-bred neutrons, it is used as a burnable poison to regulate nuclear reactors. It is used as a colorant for cubic zirconia, providing pink coloring, and for glass, providing yellow-orange coloring. In March 2017, IBM announced that they had developed a technique to store one bit of data on a single holmium atom set on a bed of magnesium oxide. With sufficient quantum and classical control techniques, holmium may be a good candidate to make quantum computers.

Holmium is used in the medical field, particularly in laser surgery for procedures such as kidney stone removal and prostate treatment, due to its precision and minimal tissue damage. Its isotope, holmium-166, is applied in targeted cancer therapies, especially for liver cancer, and it also enhances MRI imaging as a contrast agent.

==Biological role and precautions==

Holmium plays no biological role in humans, but its salts are able to stimulate metabolism. Humans typically consume about a milligram of holmium a year. Plants do not readily take up holmium from the soil. Some vegetables have had their holmium content measured, and it amounted to 100 parts per trillion. Holmium and its soluble salts are slightly toxic if ingested, but insoluble holmium salts are nontoxic. Metallic holmium in dust form presents a fire and explosion hazard. Large amounts of holmium salts can cause severe damage if inhaled, consumed orally, or injected. The biological effects of holmium over a long period of time are not known. Holmium has a low level of acute toxicity.

<doc id="13466" wikidata="Q1119" url="?curid=13466" title="Hafnium">
<text>Hafnium is a chemical element; it has symbol Hf and atomic number 72. A lustrous, silvery gray, tetravalent transition metal, hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and is found in many zirconium minerals. Its existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, though it was not identified until 1922, by Dirk Coster and George de Hevesy. Hafnium is named after , the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered.

Hafnium is used in filaments and electrodes. Some semiconductor fabrication processes use its oxide for integrated circuits at 45 nanometers and smaller feature lengths. Some superalloys used for special applications contain hafnium in combination with niobium, titanium, or tungsten.

Hafnium&#x27;s large neutron capture cross section makes it a good material for neutron absorption in control rods in nuclear power plants, but at the same time requires that it be removed from the neutron-transparent corrosion-resistant zirconium alloys used in nuclear reactors.

==Characteristics==

===Physical characteristics===

&lt;section begin=properties /&gt;
Hafnium is a shiny, silvery, ductile metal that is corrosion-resistant and chemically similar to zirconium in that they have the same number of valence electrons and are in the same group. Also, their relativistic effects are similar: The expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly canceled out by the lanthanide contraction. Hafnium changes from its alpha form, a hexagonal close-packed lattice, to its beta form, a body-centered cubic lattice, at . The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity.&lt;section end=properties /&gt;

A notable physical difference between these metals is their density, with zirconium having about one-half the density of hafnium. The most notable nuclear properties of hafnium are its high thermal neutron capture cross section and that the nuclei of several different hafnium isotopes readily absorb two or more neutrons apiece. In contrast with this, zirconium is practically transparent to thermal neutrons, and it is commonly used for the metal components of nuclear reactors—especially the cladding of their nuclear fuel rods.

===Chemical characteristics===
Hafnium reacts in air to form a protective film that inhibits further corrosion. Despite this, the metal is attacked by hydrofluoric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid, and can be oxidized with halogens or burnt in air. Like its sister metal zirconium, finely divided hafnium can ignite spontaneously in air. The metal is resistant to concentrated alkalis.

As a consequence of lanthanide contraction, the chemistry of hafnium and zirconium is so similar that the two cannot be separated based on differing chemical reactions. The melting and boiling points of the compounds and the solubility in solvents are the major differences in the chemistry of these twin elements.

===Isotopes===

At least 40 isotopes of hafnium have been observed, ranging in mass number from 153 to 192. The five stable isotopes have mass numbers ranging from 176 to 180 inclusive. The radioactive isotopes&#x27; half-lives range from 400 ms for 153Hf to years for the most stable one, the primordial 174Hf.

The extinct radionuclide 182Hf has a half-life of , and is an important tracker isotope for the formation of planetary cores. The nuclear isomer 178m2Hf was at the center of a controversy for several years regarding its potential use as a weapon.

===Occurrence===
Hafnium is estimated to make up about between 3.0 and 4.8 ppm of the Earth&#x27;s upper crust by mass. It does not exist as a free element on Earth, but is found combined in solid solution with zirconium in natural zirconium compounds such as zircon, ZrSiO4, which usually has about 1–4% of the Zr replaced by Hf. Rarely, the Hf/Zr ratio increases during crystallization to give the isostructural mineral hafnon , with atomic Hf &gt; Zr. An obsolete name for a variety of zircon containing unusually high Hf content is &quot;alvite&quot;.

A major source of zircon (and hence hafnium) ores is heavy mineral sands ore deposits, pegmatites, particularly in Brazil and Malawi, and carbonatite intrusions, particularly the Crown Polymetallic Deposit at Mount Weld, Western Australia. A potential source of hafnium is trachyte tuffs containing rare zircon-hafnium silicates eudialyte or armstrongite, at Dubbo in New South Wales, Australia.

==Production==
The heavy mineral sands ore deposits of the titanium ores ilmenite and rutile yield most of the mined zirconium, and therefore also most of the hafnium.

Zirconium is a good nuclear fuel-rod cladding metal, with the desirable properties of a very low neutron capture cross section and good chemical stability at high temperatures. However, because of hafnium&#x27;s neutron-absorbing properties, hafnium impurities in zirconium would cause it to be far less useful for nuclear reactor applications. Thus, a nearly complete separation of zirconium and hafnium is necessary for their use in nuclear power. The production of hafnium-free zirconium is the main source of hafnium.
The chemical properties of hafnium and zirconium are nearly identical, which makes the two difficult to separate. The methods first used—fractional crystallization of ammonium fluoride salts or the fractional distillation of the chloride—have not proven suitable for an industrial-scale production. After zirconium was chosen as a material for nuclear reactor programs in the 1940s, a separation method had to be developed. Liquid–liquid extraction processes with a wide variety of solvents were developed and are still used for producing hafnium. About half of all hafnium metal manufactured is produced as a by-product of zirconium refinement. The end product of the separation is hafnium(IV) chloride. The purified hafnium(IV) chloride is converted to the metal by reduction with magnesium or sodium, as in the Kroll process.
: &lt;chem&gt;HfCl4{} + 2 Mg -&gt;[1100~^\circ\text{C}] Hf{} + 2 MgCl2&lt;/chem&gt;

Further purification is effected by a chemical transport reaction developed by Arkel and de Boer: In a closed vessel, hafnium reacts with iodine at temperatures of , forming hafnium(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of the reverse reaction happens preferentially, and the chemically bound iodine and hafnium dissociate into the native elements. The hafnium forms a solid coating at the tungsten filament, and the iodine can react with additional hafnium, resulting in a steady iodine turnover and ensuring the chemical equilibrium remains in favor of hafnium production.
: &lt;chem&gt;Hf{} + 2 I2 -&gt;[500~^\circ\text{C}] HfI4&lt;/chem&gt;
: &lt;chem&gt;HfI4 -&gt;[1700~^\circ\text{C}] Hf{} + 2 I2&lt;/chem&gt;

==Chemical compounds==

Due to the lanthanide contraction, the ionic radius of hafnium(IV) (0.78 ångström) is almost the same as that of zirconium(IV) (0.79 angstroms). Consequently, compounds of hafnium(IV) and zirconium(IV) have very similar chemical and physical properties. Hafnium and zirconium tend to occur together in nature and the similarity of their ionic radii makes their chemical separation rather difficult. Hafnium tends to form inorganic compounds in the oxidation state of +4. Halogens react with it to form hafnium tetrahalides. At higher temperatures, hafnium reacts with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, boron, sulfur, and silicon. Some hafnium compounds in lower oxidation states are known.

Hafnium(IV) chloride and hafnium(IV) iodide have some applications in the production and purification of hafnium metal. They are volatile solids with polymeric structures. These tetrachlorides are precursors to various organohafnium compounds such as hafnocene dichloride and tetrabenzylhafnium.

The white hafnium oxide (HfO2), with a melting point of and a boiling point of roughly , is very similar to zirconia, but slightly more basic. Hafnium carbide is the most refractory binary compound known, with a melting point over , and hafnium nitride is the most refractory of all known metal nitrides, with a melting point of . This has led to proposals that hafnium or its carbides might be useful as construction materials that are subjected to very high temperatures. The mixed carbide tantalum hafnium carbide () possesses the highest melting point of any currently known compound, . Recent supercomputer simulations suggest a hafnium alloy with a melting point of .

==History==

Hafnium&#x27;s existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869.
In his report on &quot;The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements&quot;, in 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev had implicitly predicted the existence of a heavier analog of titanium and zirconium. At the time of his formulation in 1871, Mendeleev believed that the elements were ordered by their atomic masses and placed lanthanum (element 57) in the spot below zirconium. The exact placement of the elements and the location of missing elements was done by determining the specific weight of the elements and comparing the chemical and physical properties.

The X-ray spectroscopy done by Henry Moseley in 1914 showed a direct dependency between spectral line and effective nuclear charge. This led to the nuclear charge, or atomic number of an element, being used to ascertain its place within the periodic table. With this method, Moseley determined the number of lanthanides and showed the gaps in the atomic number sequence at numbers 43, 61, 72, and 75.

The discovery of the gaps led to an extensive search for the missing elements. In 1914, several people claimed the discovery after Henry Moseley predicted the gap in the periodic table for the then-undiscovered element 72. Georges Urbain asserted that he found element 72 in the rare earth elements in 1907 and published his results on &quot;celtium&quot; in 1911. Neither the spectra nor the chemical behavior he claimed matched with the element found later, and therefore his claim was turned down after a long-standing controversy. The controversy was partly because the chemists favored the chemical techniques which led to the discovery of &quot;celtium&quot;, while the physicists relied on the use of the new X-ray spectroscopy method that proved that the substances discovered by Urbain did not contain element 72. In 1921, Charles R. Bury suggested that element 72 should resemble zirconium and therefore was not part of the rare earth elements group. By early 1923, Niels Bohr and others agreed with Bury. These suggestions were based on Bohr&#x27;s theories of the atom which were identical to chemist Charles Bury, the X-ray spectroscopy of Moseley, and the chemical arguments of Friedrich Paneth.

Encouraged by these suggestions and by the reappearance in 1922 of Urbain&#x27;s claims that element 72 was a rare earth element discovered in 1911, Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy were motivated to search for the new element in zirconium ores. Hafnium was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark, validating the original 1869 prediction of Mendeleev. It was ultimately found in zircon in Norway through X-ray spectroscopy analysis. The place where the discovery took place led to the element being named for the Latin name for &quot;Copenhagen&quot;, &quot;Hafnia&quot;, the home town of Niels Bohr. Today, the Faculty of Science of the University of Copenhagen uses in its seal a stylized image of the hafnium atom.

Hafnium was separated from zirconium through repeated recrystallization of the double ammonium or potassium fluorides by Valdemar Thal Jantzen and von Hevesey. Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer were the first to prepare metallic hafnium by passing hafnium tetraiodide vapor over a heated tungsten filament in 1924. This process for differential purification of zirconium and hafnium is still in use today.

Hafnium was one of the last two stable elements to be discovered. The element rhenium was found in 1908 by Masataka Ogawa, though its atomic number was misidentified at the time, and it was not generally recognised by the scientific community until its rediscovery by Walter Noddack, Ida Noddack, and Otto Berg in 1925. This makes it somewhat difficult to say if hafnium or rhenium was discovered last.

In 1923, six predicted elements were still missing from the periodic table: 43 (technetium), 61 (promethium), 85 (astatine), and 87 (francium) are radioactive elements and are only present in trace amounts in the environment, thus making elements 75 (rhenium) and 72 (hafnium) the last two unknown non-radioactive elements.

==Applications==
Most of the hafnium produced is used in the manufacture of control rods for nuclear reactors.

Hafnium has limited technical applications due to a few factors. First, it&#x27;s very similar to zirconium, a more abundant element that can be used in most cases. Second, pure hafnium wasn&#x27;t widely available until the late 1950s, when it became a byproduct of the nuclear industry&#x27;s need for hafnium-free zirconium. Additionally, hafnium is rare and difficult to separate from other elements, making it expensive. After the Fukushima disaster reduced the demand for hafnium-free zirconium, the price of hafnium increased significantly from around $500–$600/kg ($227-$272/lb) in 2014 to around $1000/kg ($454/lb) in 2015.

===Nuclear reactors===
The nuclei of several hafnium isotopes can each absorb multiple neutrons. This makes hafnium a good material for nuclear reactors&#x27; control rods. Its neutron capture cross section (Capture Resonance Integral Io ≈ 2000 barns) is about 600 times that of zirconium (other elements that are good neutron-absorbers for control rods are cadmium and boron). Excellent mechanical properties and exceptional corrosion-resistance properties allow its use in the harsh environment of pressurized water reactors. The German research reactor FRM II uses hafnium as a neutron absorber. It is also common in military reactors, particularly in US naval submarine reactors, to slow reactor rates that are too high. It is seldom found in civilian reactors, the first core of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station (a conversion of a naval reactor) being a notable exception.

===Alloys===

Hafnium is used in alloys with iron, titanium, niobium, tantalum, and other metals. An alloy used for liquid-rocket thruster nozzles, for example the main engine of the Apollo Lunar Modules, is C103 which consists of 89% niobium, 10% hafnium and 1% titanium.

Small additions of hafnium increase the adherence of protective oxide scales on nickel-based alloys. It thereby improves the corrosion resistance, especially under cyclic temperature conditions that tend to break oxide scales, by inducing thermal stresses between the bulk material and the oxide layer.

===Microprocessors===
Hafnium-based compounds are employed in gates of transistors as insulators in the 45 nm (and below) generation of integrated circuits from Intel, IBM and others. Hafnium oxide-based compounds are practical high-k dielectrics, allowing reduction of the gate leakage current which improves performance at such scales.

===Isotope geochemistry===
Isotopes of hafnium and lutetium (along with ytterbium) are also used in isotope geochemistry and geochronological applications, in lutetium-hafnium dating. It is often used as a tracer of isotopic evolution of Earth&#x27;s mantle through time. This is because 176Lu decays to 176Hf with a half-life of approximately 37 billion years.

In most geologic materials, zircon is the dominant host of hafnium (&gt;10,000 ppm) and is often the focus of hafnium studies in geology. Hafnium is readily substituted into the zircon crystal lattice, and is therefore very resistant to hafnium mobility and contamination. Zircon also has an extremely low Lu/Hf ratio, making any correction for initial lutetium minimal. Although the Lu/Hf system can be used to calculate a &quot;model age&quot;, i.e. the time at which it was derived from a given isotopic reservoir such as the depleted mantle, these &quot;ages&quot; do not carry the same geologic significance as do other geochronological techniques as the results often yield isotopic mixtures and thus provide an average age of the material from which it was derived.

Garnet is another mineral that contains appreciable amounts of hafnium to act as a geochronometer. The high and variable Lu/Hf ratios found in garnet make it useful for dating metamorphic events.

===Other uses===
Due to its heat resistance and its affinity to oxygen and nitrogen, hafnium is a good scavenger for oxygen and nitrogen in gas-filled and incandescent lamps. Hafnium is also used as the electrode in plasma cutting because of its ability to shed electrons into the air.

The high energy content of 178m2Hf was the concern of a DARPA-funded program in the US. This program eventually concluded that using the above-mentioned 178m2Hf nuclear isomer of hafnium to construct high-yield weapons with X-ray triggering mechanisms—an application of induced gamma emission—was infeasible because of its expense. See &quot;hafnium controversy&quot;.

Hafnium metallocene compounds can be prepared from hafnium tetrachloride and various cyclopentadiene-type ligand species. Perhaps the simplest hafnium metallocene is hafnocene dichloride. Hafnium metallocenes are part of a large collection of Group 4 transition metal metallocene catalysts that are used worldwide in the production of polyolefin resins like polyethylene and polypropylene.

A pyridyl-amidohafnium catalyst can be used for the controlled iso-selective polymerization of propylene which can then be combined with polyethylene to make a much tougher recycled plastic.

Hafnium diselenide is studied in spintronics thanks to its charge density wave and superconductivity.

==Precautions==
Care needs to be taken when machining hafnium because it is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously combust when exposed to air. Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should be handled as if they were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.

People can be exposed to hafnium in the workplace by breathing, swallowing, skin, and eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for exposure to hafnium and hafnium compounds in the workplace as TWA 0.5 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set the same recommended exposure limit (REL). At levels of 50 mg/m3, hafnium is immediately dangerous to life and health.
