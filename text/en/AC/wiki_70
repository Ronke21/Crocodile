<text>The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of &quot;Equus ferus&quot;. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, &quot;Eohippus&quot;, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE. Horses in the subspecies &quot;caballus&quot; are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, which are horses that never have been domesticated. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.

Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, and possess a good sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults. Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years.

Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited &quot;hot bloods&quot; with speed and endurance; &quot;cold bloods&quot;, such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and &quot;warmbloods&quot;, developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses.

Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy. Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control. Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. 

==Biology==

===Lifespan and life stages===
Depending on breed, management and environment, the modern domestic horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years. Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond. The oldest verifiable record was &quot;Old Billy&quot;, a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62. In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age 56.

Regardless of a horse or pony&#x27;s actual birth date, for most competition purposes a year is added to its age each January 1 of each year in the Northern Hemisphere and each August 1 in the Southern Hemisphere. The exception is in endurance riding, where the minimum age to compete is based on the animal&#x27;s actual calendar age.

The following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages:
; Foal
: A horse of either sex less than one year old. A nursing foal is sometimes called a &quot;suckling&quot;, and a foal that has been weaned is called a &quot;weanling&quot;. Most domesticated foals are weaned at five to seven months of age, although foals can be weaned at four months with no adverse physical effects.
; Yearling
: A horse of either sex that is between one and two years old.
; Colt
: A male horse under the age of four. A common terminology error is to call any young horse a &quot;colt&quot;, when the term actually only refers to young male horses.
; Filly
: A female horse under the age of four.
; Mare
: A female horse four years old and older.
; Stallion
: A non-castrated male horse four years old and older. The term &quot;horse&quot; is sometimes used colloquially to refer specifically to a stallion.
; Gelding
: A castrated male horse of any age.

In horse racing, these definitions may differ: For example, in the British Isles, Thoroughbred horse racing defines colts and fillies as less than five years old. However, Australian Thoroughbred racing defines colts and fillies as less than four years old.

===Size and measurement===
The height of horses is measured at the highest point of the withers, where the neck meets the back. This point is used because it is a stable point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move up and down in relation to the body of the horse.
In English-speaking countries, the height of horses is often stated in units of hands and inches: one hand is equal to . The height is expressed as the number of full hands, followed by a point, then the number of additional inches, and ending with the abbreviation &quot;h&quot; or &quot;hh&quot; (for &quot;hands high&quot;). Thus, a horse described as &quot;15.2 h&quot; is 15 hands plus 2 inches, for a total of in height.

The size of horses varies by breed, but also is influenced by nutrition. Light-riding horses usually range in height from and can weigh from . Larger-riding horses usually start at about and often are as tall as , weighing from . Heavy or draft horses are usually at least high and can be as tall as high. They can weigh from about .

The largest horse in recorded history was probably a Shire horse named Mammoth, who was born in 1848. He stood high and his peak weight was estimated at . The record holder for the smallest horse ever is Thumbelina, a fully mature miniature horse affected by dwarfism. She was tall and weighed .

====Ponies====

Ponies are taxonomically the same animals as horses. The distinction between a horse and pony is commonly drawn on the basis of height, especially for competition purposes. However, height alone is not dispositive; the difference between horses and ponies may also include aspects of phenotype, including conformation and temperament.

The traditional standard for height of a horse or a pony at maturity is . An animal or over is usually considered to be a horse and one less than a pony, but there are many exceptions to the traditional standard. In Australia, ponies are considered to be those under . For competition in the Western division of the United States Equestrian Federation, the cutoff is . The International Federation for Equestrian Sports, the world governing body for horse sport, uses metric measurements and defines a pony as being any horse measuring less than at the withers without shoes, which is just over , and , with shoes.

Height is not the sole criterion for distinguishing horses from ponies. Breed registries for horses that typically produce individuals both under and over consider all animals of that breed to be horses regardless of their height. Conversely, some pony breeds may have features in common with horses, and individual animals may occasionally mature at over , but are still considered to be ponies.

Ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, and overall coat. They also have proportionally shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad foreheads. They may have calmer temperaments than horses and also a high level of intelligence that may or may not be used to cooperate with human handlers. Small size, by itself, is not an exclusive determinant. For example, the Shetland pony which averages , is considered a pony.Conversely, breeds such as the Falabella and other miniature horses, which can be no taller than , are classified by their registries as very small horses, not ponies.

===Genetics===
Horses have 64 chromosomes. The horse genome was sequenced in 2007. It contains 2.7 billion DNA base pairs, which is larger than the dog genome, but smaller than the human genome or the bovine genome. The map is available to researchers.

===Colors and markings===

Horses exhibit a diverse array of coat colors and distinctive markings, described by a specialized vocabulary. Often, a horse is classified first by its coat color, before breed or sex. Horses of the same color may be distinguished from one another by white markings, which, along with various spotting patterns, are inherited separately from coat color.

Many genes that create horse coat colors and patterns have been identified. Current genetic tests can identify at least 13 different alleles influencing coat color, and research continues to discover new genes linked to specific traits. The basic coat colors of chestnut and black are determined by the gene controlled by the Melanocortin 1 receptor, also known as the &quot;extension gene&quot; or &quot;red factor&quot;. Its recessive form is &quot;red&quot; (chestnut) and its dominant form is black. Additional genes control suppression of black color to point coloration that results in a bay, spotting patterns such as pinto or leopard, dilution genes such as palomino or dun, as well as greying, and all the other factors that create the many possible coat colors found in horses.

Horses that have a white coat color are often mislabeled; a horse that looks &quot;white&quot; is usually a middle-aged or older gray. Grays are born a darker shade, get lighter as they age, but usually keep black skin underneath their white hair coat (with the exception of pink skin under white markings). The only horses properly called white are born with a predominantly white hair coat and pink skin, a fairly rare occurrence. Different and unrelated genetic factors can produce white coat colors in horses, including several different alleles of dominant white and the sabino-1 gene. However, there are no &quot;albino&quot; horses, defined as having both pink skin and red eyes.

===Reproduction and development===

Gestation lasts approximately 340 days, with an average range 320–370 days, and usually results in one foal; twins are rare. Horses are a precocial species, and foals are capable of standing and running within a short time following birth. Foals are usually born in the spring. The estrous cycle of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. Most mares enter an &quot;anestrus&quot; period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period. Foals are generally weaned from their mothers between four and six months of age.

Horses, particularly colts, are sometimes physically capable of reproduction at about 18 months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed before the age of three, especially females. Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse&#x27;s size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the epiphyseal plates are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.

Depending on maturity, breed, and work expected, horses are usually put under saddle and trained to be ridden between the ages of two and four. Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries, horses specifically bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed. For endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60 calendar months (five years) old.

===Anatomy===
====Skeletal system====
The horse skeleton averages 205 bones. A significant difference between the horse skeleton and that of a human is the lack of a collarbone—the horse&#x27;s forelimbs are attached to the spinal column by a powerful set of muscles, tendons, and ligaments that attach the shoulder blade to the torso. The horse&#x27;s four legs and hooves are also unique structures. Their leg bones are proportioned differently from those of a human. For example, the body part that is called a horse&#x27;s &quot;knee&quot; is actually made up of the carpal bones that correspond to the human wrist. Similarly, the hock contains bones equivalent to those in the human ankle and heel. The lower leg bones of a horse correspond to the bones of the human hand or foot, and the fetlock (incorrectly called the &quot;ankle&quot;) is actually the proximal sesamoid bones between the cannon bones (a single equivalent to the human metacarpal or metatarsal bones) and the proximal phalanges, located where one finds the &quot;knuckles&quot; of a human. A horse also has no muscles in its legs below the knees and hocks, only skin, hair, bone, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and the assorted specialized tissues that make up the hoof.

====Hooves====
The critical importance of the feet and legs is summed up by the traditional adage, &quot;no foot, no horse&quot;. The horse hoof begins with the distal phalanges, the equivalent of the human fingertip or tip of the toe, surrounded by cartilage and other specialized, blood-rich soft tissues such as the laminae. The exterior hoof wall and horn of the sole is made of keratin, the same material as a human fingernail. The result is that a horse, weighing on average , travels on the same bones as would a human on tiptoe. For the protection of the hoof under certain conditions, some horses have horseshoes placed on their feet by a professional farrier. The hoof continually grows, and in most domesticated horses needs to be trimmed (and horseshoes reset, if used) every five to eight weeks, though the hooves of horses in the wild wear down and regrow at a rate suitable for their terrain.

====Teeth====
Horses are adapted to grazing. In an adult horse, there are 12 incisors at the front of the mouth, adapted to biting off the grass or other vegetation. There are 24 teeth adapted for chewing, the premolars and molars, at the back of the mouth. Stallions and geldings have four additional teeth just behind the incisors, a type of canine teeth called &quot;tushes&quot;. Some horses, both male and female, will also develop one to four very small vestigial teeth in front of the molars, known as &quot;wolf&quot; teeth, which are generally removed because they can interfere with the bit. There is an empty interdental space between the incisors and the molars where the bit rests directly on the gums, or &quot;bars&quot; of the horse&#x27;s mouth when the horse is bridled.

An estimate of a horse&#x27;s age can be made from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough estimate of a horse&#x27;s age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.

====Digestion====

Horses are herbivores with a digestive system adapted to a forage diet of grasses and other plant material, consumed steadily throughout the day. Therefore, compared to humans, they have a relatively small stomach but very long intestines to facilitate a steady flow of nutrients. A horse will eat of food per day and, under normal use, drink of water. Horses are not ruminants, having only one stomach, like humans. But unlike humans, they can digest cellulose, a major component of grass, through the process of hindgut fermentation. Cellulose fermentation by symbiotic bacteria and other microbes occurs in the cecum and the large intestine. Horses cannot vomit, so digestion problems can quickly cause colic, a leading cause of death. Although horses do not have a gallbladder, they tolerate high amounts of fat in their diet.

====Senses====
The horses&#x27; senses are based on their status as prey animals, where they must be aware of their surroundings at all times. The equine eye is one of the largest of any land mammal. Horses are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads. This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision. Horses have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color vision is somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.

Their sense of smell, while much better than that of humans, is not quite as good as that of a dog. It is believed to play a key role in the social interactions of horses as well as detecting other key scents in the environment. Horses have two olfactory centers. The first system is in the nostrils and nasal cavity, which analyze a wide range of odors. The second, located under the nasal cavity, are the vomeronasal organs, also called Jacobson&#x27;s organs. These have a separate nerve pathway to the brain and appear to primarily analyze pheromones.

A horse&#x27;s hearing is good, and the pinna of each ear can rotate up to 180°, giving the potential for 360° hearing without having to move the head. Noise affects the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress—a 2013 study in the UK indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music. This study also recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 decibels. An Australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio had a higher rate of gastric ulcers than horses listening to music, and racehorses stabled where a radio was played had a higher overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled where there was no radio playing.

Horses have a great sense of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly developed proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times. A horse&#x27;s sense of touch is well-developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.

Horses have an advanced sense of taste, which allows them to sort through fodder and choose what they would most like to eat, and their prehensile lips can easily sort even small grains. Horses generally will not eat poisonous plants, however, there are exceptions; horses will occasionally eat toxic amounts of poisonous plants even when there is adequate healthy food.

===Movement===
All horses move naturally with four basic gaits:
*the four-beat walk, which averages ; 
*the two-beat trot or jog at (faster for harness racing horses);
*the canter or lope, a three-beat gait that is ; 
*the gallop, which averages , but the world record for a horse galloping over a short, sprint distance is . 
Besides these basic gaits, some horses perform a two-beat pace, instead of the trot. There also are several four-beat &#x27;ambling&#x27; gaits that are approximately the speed of a trot or pace, though smoother to ride. These include the lateral rack, running walk, and tölt as well as the diagonal fox trot. Ambling gaits are often genetic in some breeds, known collectively as gaited horses. These horses replace the trot with one of the ambling gaits.

===Behavior===
Horses are prey animals with a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first reaction to a threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. They also tend to be curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.
Horses are herd animals, with a clear hierarchy of rank, led by a dominant individual, usually a mare. They are also social creatures that are able to form companionship attachments to their own species and to other animals, including humans. They communicate in various ways, including vocalizations such as nickering or whinnying, mutual grooming, and body language. Many horses will become difficult to manage if they are isolated, but with training, horses can learn to accept a human as a companion, and thus be comfortable away from other horses. However, when confined with insufficient companionship, exercise, or stimulation, individuals may develop stable vices, an assortment of bad habits, mostly stereotypies of psychological origin, that include wood chewing, wall kicking, &quot;weaving&quot; (rocking back and forth), and other problems.

====Intelligence and learning====
Studies have indicated that horses perform a number of cognitive tasks on a daily basis, meeting mental challenges that include food procurement and identification of individuals within a social system. They also have good spatial discrimination abilities. They are naturally curious and apt to investigate things they have not seen before. Studies have assessed equine intelligence in areas such as problem solving, speed of learning, and memory. Horses excel at simple learning, but also are able to use more advanced cognitive abilities that involve categorization and concept learning. They can learn using habituation, desensitization, classical conditioning, and operant conditioning, and positive and negative reinforcement. One study has indicated that horses can differentiate between &quot;more or less&quot; if the quantity involved is less than four.

Domesticated horses may face greater mental challenges than wild horses, because they live in artificial environments that prevent instinctive behavior whilst also learning tasks that are not natural. Horses are animals of habit that respond well to regimentation, and respond best when the same routines and techniques are used consistently. One trainer believes that &quot;intelligent&quot; horses are reflections of intelligent trainers who effectively use response conditioning techniques and positive reinforcement to train in the style that best fits with an individual animal&#x27;s natural inclinations.

====Temperament====

Horses are mammals. As such, they are warm-blooded, or endothermic creatures, as opposed to cold-blooded, or poikilothermic animals. However, these words have developed a separate meaning in the context of equine terminology, used to describe temperament, not body temperature. For example, the &quot;hot-bloods&quot;, such as many race horses, exhibit more sensitivity and energy, while the &quot;cold-bloods&quot;, such as most draft breeds, are quieter and calmer. Sometimes &quot;hot-bloods&quot; are classified as &quot;light horses&quot; or &quot;riding horses&quot;, with the &quot;cold-bloods&quot; classified as &quot;draft horses&quot; or &quot;work horses&quot;.
&quot;Hot blooded&quot; breeds include &quot;oriental horses&quot; such as the Akhal-Teke, Arabian horse, Barb, and now-extinct Turkoman horse, as well as the Thoroughbred, a breed developed in England from the older oriental breeds. Hot bloods tend to be spirited, bold, and learn quickly. They are bred for agility and speed. They tend to be physically refined—thin-skinned, slim, and long-legged. The original oriental breeds were brought to Europe from the Middle East and North Africa when European breeders wished to infuse these traits into racing and light cavalry horses.

Muscular, heavy draft horses are known as &quot;cold bloods.&quot; They are bred not only for strength, but also to have the calm, patient temperament needed to pull a plow or a heavy carriage full of people. They are sometimes nicknamed &quot;gentle giants&quot;. Well-known draft breeds include the Belgian and the Clydesdale. Some, like the Percheron, are lighter and livelier, developed to pull carriages or to plow large fields in drier climates. Others, such as the Shire, are slower and more powerful, bred to plow fields with heavy, clay-based soils. The cold-blooded group also includes some pony breeds.

&quot;Warmblood&quot; breeds, such as the Trakehner or Hanoverian, developed when European carriage and war horses were crossed with Arabians or Thoroughbreds, producing a riding horse with more refinement than a draft horse, but greater size and milder temperament than a lighter breed. Certain pony breeds with warmblood characteristics have been developed for smaller riders. Warmbloods are considered a &quot;light horse&quot; or &quot;riding horse&quot;.

Today, the term &quot;Warmblood&quot; refers to a specific subset of sport horse breeds that are used for competition in dressage and show jumping. Strictly speaking, the term &quot;warm blood&quot; refers to any cross between cold-blooded and hot-blooded breeds. Examples include breeds such as the Irish Draught or the Cleveland Bay. The term was once used to refer to breeds of light riding horse other than Thoroughbreds or Arabians, such as the Morgan horse.

====Sleep patterns====
Horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down. In an adaptation from life in the wild, horses are able to enter light sleep by using a &quot;stay apparatus&quot; in their legs, allowing them to doze without collapsing. Horses sleep better when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard to watch for predators. A horse kept alone will not sleep well because its instincts are to keep a constant eye out for danger.

Unlike humans, horses do not sleep in a solid, unbroken period of time, but take many short periods of rest. Horses spend four to fifteen hours a day in standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. Total sleep time in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours, mostly in short intervals of about 15 minutes each. The average sleep time of a domestic horse is said to be 2.9 hours per day.

Horses must lie down to reach REM sleep. They only have to lie down for an hour or two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may suddenly collapse because it slips, involuntarily, into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The horse adapted to survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, surviving in an ecosystem where other large grazing animals, especially ruminants, could not. Horses and other equids are odd-toed ungulates of the order Perissodactyla, a group of mammals dominant during the Tertiary period. In the past, this order contained 14 families, but only three—Equidae (the horse and related species), Tapiridae (the tapir), and Rhinocerotidae (the rhinoceroses)—have survived to the present day.

The earliest known member of the family Equidae was the &quot;Hyracotherium&quot;, which lived between 45 and 55 million years ago, during the Eocene period. It had 4 toes on each front foot, and 3 toes on each back foot. The extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the &quot;Mesohippus&quot;, which lived 32 to 37 million years ago. Over time, the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished. All that remains of them in modern horses is a set of small vestigial bones on the leg below the knee, known informally as splint bones. Their legs also lengthened as their toes disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed. By about 5 million years ago, the modern &quot;Equus&quot; had evolved. Equid teeth also evolved from browsing on soft, tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material, then to grazing of tougher plains grasses. Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the steppes of Eurasia and the Great Plains of North America.

By about 15,000 years ago, &quot;Equus ferus&quot; was a widespread holarctic species. Horse bones from this time period, the late Pleistocene, are found in Europe, Eurasia, Beringia, and North America. Yet between 10,000 and 7,600 years ago, the horse became extinct in North America. The reasons for this extinction are not fully known, but one theory notes that extinction in North America paralleled human arrival. Another theory points to climate change, noting that approximately 12,500 years ago, the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub tundra, which was covered with unpalatable plants.

===Wild species surviving into modern times===
A truly wild horse is a species or subspecies with no ancestors that were ever successfully domesticated. Therefore, most &quot;wild&quot; horses today are actually feral horses, animals that escaped or were turned loose from domestic herds and the descendants of those animals. Only two wild subspecies, the tarpan and the Przewalski&#x27;s horse, survived into recorded history and only the latter survives today.

The Przewalski&#x27;s horse (&quot;Equus ferus przewalskii&quot;), named after the Russian explorer Nikolai Przhevalsky, is a rare Asian animal. It is also known as the Mongolian wild horse; Mongolian people know it as the &quot;taki&quot;, and the Kyrgyz people call it a &quot;kirtag&quot;. The subspecies was presumed extinct in the wild between 1969 and 1992, while a small breeding population survived in zoos around the world. In 1992, it was reestablished in the wild by the conservation efforts of numerous zoos. Today, a small wild breeding population exists in Mongolia. There are additional animals still maintained at zoos throughout the world.

Their status as a truly wild horse was called into question when domestic horses of the 5,000-year-old Botai culture of Central Asia were found to be more closely related to Przewalski&#x27;s horses than to &quot;E. f. caballus&quot;. The study raised the possibility that modern Przewalski&#x27;s horses could be the feral descendants of the domestic Botai horses. The study concluded that the Botai animals appear to have been an independent domestication attempt and apparently unsuccessful in terms of genetic markers carrying through to modern domesticated equines. However, the question of whether all Przewalski&#x27;s horses descend from this population is also unresolved, as only one of seven modern Przewalski’s horses in the study shared this ancestry. It may also be that both the Botai horses and the modern Przewalski&#x27;s horses descend separately from the same ancient wild Przewalski&#x27;s horse population.

The tarpan or European wild horse (&quot;Equus ferus ferus&quot;) was found in Europe and much of Asia. It survived into the historical era, but became extinct in 1909, when the last captive died in a Russian zoo. Thus, the genetic line was lost. Attempts have been made to recreate the tarpan, which resulted in horses with outward physical similarities, but nonetheless descended from domesticated ancestors and not true wild horses.

Periodically, populations of horses in isolated areas are speculated to be relict populations of wild horses, but generally have been proven to be feral or domestic. For example, the Riwoche horse of Tibet was proposed as such, but testing did not reveal genetic differences from domesticated horses. Similarly, the Sorraia of Portugal was proposed as a direct descendant of the Tarpan on the basis of shared characteristics, but genetic studies have shown that the Sorraia is more closely related to other horse breeds, and that the outward similarity is an unreliable measure of relatedness.

===Other modern equids===

Besides the horse, there are six other species of genus &quot;Equus&quot; in the Equidae family. These are the ass or donkey, &quot;Equus asinus&quot;; the mountain zebra, &quot;Equus zebra&quot;; plains zebra, &quot;Equus quagga&quot;; Grévy&#x27;s zebra, &quot;Equus grevyi&quot;; the kiang, &quot;Equus kiang&quot;; and the onager, &quot;Equus hemionus&quot;.

Horses can crossbreed with other members of their genus. The most common hybrid is the mule, a cross between a &quot;jack&quot; (male donkey) and a mare. A related hybrid, a hinny, is a cross between a stallion and a &quot;jenny&quot; (female donkey). Other hybrids include the zorse, a cross between a zebra and a horse. With rare exceptions, most hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce.

==Domestication and history==

Domestication of the horse most likely took place in central Asia prior to 3500 BCE. Two major sources of information are used to determine where and when the horse was first domesticated and how the domesticated horse spread around the world. The first source is based on palaeological and archaeological discoveries; the second source is a comparison of DNA obtained from modern horses to that from bones and teeth of ancient horse remains.

The earliest archaeological evidence for attempted domestication of the horse comes from sites in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, dating to approximately 4000–3500 BCE. However the horses domesticated at the Botai culture in Kazakhstan were Przewalski&#x27;s horses and not the ancestors of modern horses.

By 3000 BCE, the horse was completely domesticated and by 2000 BCE there was a sharp increase in the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern Europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent. The most recent, but most irrefutable evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were interred with chariots in graves of the Indo-European Sintashta and Petrovka cultures 2100 BCE.

A 2021 genetic study suggested that most modern domestic horses descend from the lower Volga-Don region. Ancient horse genomes indicate that these populations influenced almost all local populations as they expanded rapidly throughout Eurasia, beginning about 4,200 years ago. It also shows that certain adaptations were strongly selected due to riding, and that equestrian material culture, including Sintashta spoke-wheeled chariots spread with the horse itself.

Domestication is also studied by using the genetic material of present-day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. The variation in the genetic material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds. This is reflected in the difference in genetic variation between the DNA that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (Y-chromosome) versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (mitochondrial DNA). There are very low levels of Y-chromosome variability, but a great deal of genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA. There is also regional variation in mitochondrial DNA due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds. Another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color variation. In horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 BCE.

Before the availability of DNA techniques to resolve the questions related to the domestication of the horse, various hypotheses were proposed. One classification was based on body types and conformation, suggesting the presence of four basic prototypes that had adapted to their environment prior to domestication. Another hypothesis held that the four prototypes originated from a single wild species and that all different body types were entirely a result of selective breeding after domestication. However, the lack of a detectable substructure in the horse has resulted in a rejection of both hypotheses.

===Feral populations===

Feral horses are born and live in the wild, but are descended from domesticated animals. Many populations of feral horses exist throughout the world. Studies of feral herds have provided useful insights into the behavior of prehistoric horses, as well as greater understanding of the instincts and behaviors that drive horses that live in domesticated conditions.

There are also semi-feral horses in many parts of the world, such as Dartmoor and the New Forest in the UK, where the animals are all privately owned but live for significant amounts of time in &quot;wild&quot; conditions on undeveloped, often public, lands. Owners of such animals often pay a fee for grazing rights.

===Breeds===
The concept of purebred bloodstock and a controlled, written breed registry has come to be particularly significant and important in modern times. Sometimes purebred horses are incorrectly or inaccurately called &quot;thoroughbreds&quot;. Thoroughbred is a specific breed of horse, while a &quot;purebred&quot; is a horse (or any other animal) with a defined pedigree recognized by a breed registry. Horse breeds are groups of horses with distinctive characteristics that are transmitted consistently to their offspring, such as conformation, color, performance ability, or disposition. These inherited traits result from a combination of natural crosses and artificial selection methods. Horses have been selectively bred since their domestication. An early example of people who practiced selective horse breeding were the Bedouin, who had a reputation for careful practices, keeping extensive pedigrees of their Arabian horses and placing great value upon pure bloodlines. These pedigrees were originally transmitted via an oral tradition.

Breeds developed due to a need for &quot;form to function&quot;, the necessity to develop certain characteristics in order to perform a particular type of work. Thus, a powerful but refined breed such as the Andalusian developed as riding horses with an aptitude for dressage. Heavy draft horses were developed out of a need to perform demanding farm work and pull heavy wagons. Other horse breeds had been developed specifically for light agricultural work, carriage and road work, various sport disciplines, or simply as pets. Some breeds developed through centuries of crossing other breeds, while others descended from a single foundation sire, or other limited or restricted foundation bloodstock. One of the earliest formal registries was General Stud Book for Thoroughbreds, which began in 1791 and traced back to the foundation bloodstock for the breed. There are more than 300 horse breeds in the world today.

==Interaction with humans==

Worldwide, horses play a role within human cultures and have done so for millennia. Horses are used for leisure activities, sports, and working purposes. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that in 2008, there were almost 59,000,000 horses in the world, with around 33,500,000 in the Americas, 13,800,000 in Asia and 6,300,000 in Europe and smaller portions in Africa and Oceania. There are estimated to be 9,500,000 horses in the United States alone. The American Horse Council estimates that horse-related activities have a direct impact on the economy of the United States of over $39 billion, and when indirect spending is considered, the impact is over $102 billion. In a 2004 &quot;poll&quot; conducted by Animal Planet, more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries voted for the horse as the world&#x27;s 4th favorite animal.

Communication between human and horse is paramount in any equestrian activity; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle on their backs to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle, and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. Many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.

===Sport===

Historically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and honed the excellent horsemanship that was needed in battle. Many sports, such as dressage, eventing, and show jumping, have origins in military training, which were focused on control and balance of both horse and rider. Other sports, such as rodeo, developed from practical skills such as those needed on working ranches and stations. Sport hunting from horseback evolved from earlier practical hunting techniques. Horse racing of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers. All forms of competition, requiring demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport. The popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.

Horses are trained to be ridden or driven in a variety of sporting competitions. Examples include show jumping, dressage, three-day eventing, competitive driving, endurance riding, gymkhana, rodeos, and fox hunting. Horse shows, which have their origins in medieval European fairs, are held around the world. They host a huge range of classes, covering all of the mounted and harness disciplines, as well as &quot;In-hand&quot; classes where the horses are led, rather than ridden, to be evaluated on their conformation. The method of judging varies with the discipline, but winning usually depends on style and ability of both horse and rider.
Sports such as polo do not judge the horse itself, but rather use the horse as a partner for human competitors as a necessary part of the game. Although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider&#x27;s actions—be it getting a ball through a goal or some other task. Examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include jousting, in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other, and buzkashi, a team game played throughout Central Asia, the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.

Horse racing is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world. There are three types: &quot;flat&quot; racing; steeplechasing, i.e. racing over jumps; and harness racing, where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a sulky. A major part of horse racing&#x27;s economic importance lies in the gambling associated with it.

===Work===
There are certain jobs that horses do very well, and no technology has yet developed to fully replace them. For example, mounted police horses are still effective for certain types of patrol duties and crowd control. Cattle ranches still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote, rugged terrain. Search and rescue organizations in some countries depend upon mounted teams to locate people, particularly hikers and children, and to provide disaster relief assistance. Horses can also be used in areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil, such as nature reserves. They may also be the only form of transport allowed in wilderness areas. Horses are quieter than motorized vehicles. Law enforcement officers such as park rangers or game wardens may use horses for patrols, and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective.

Although machinery has replaced horses in many parts of the world, an estimated 100 million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas. This number includes around 27 million working animals in Africa alone. Some land management practices such as cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with horses. In agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animals such as horses. Logging with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.

===Warfare===
Horses have been used in warfare for most of recorded history. The first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 BCE, and the use of horses in warfare was widespread by the end of the Bronze Age. Although mechanization has largely replaced the horse as a weapon of war, horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas of rough terrain where motorized vehicles are ineffective. Horses have been used in the 21st century by the Janjaweed militias in the War in Darfur.

===Entertainment and culture===
Modern horses are often used to reenact many of their historical work purposes. Horses are used, complete with equipment that is authentic or a meticulously recreated replica, in various live action historical reenactments of specific periods of history, especially recreations of famous battles. Horses are also used to preserve cultural traditions and for ceremonial purposes. Countries such as the United Kingdom still use horse-drawn carriages to convey royalty and other VIPs to and from certain culturally significant events. Public exhibitions are another example, such as the Budweiser Clydesdales, seen in parades and other public settings, a team of draft horses that pull a beer wagon similar to that used before the invention of the modern motorized truck.

Horses are frequently used in television, films and literature. They are sometimes featured as a major character in films about particular animals, but also used as visual elements that assure the accuracy of historical stories. Both live horses and iconic images of horses are used in advertising to promote a variety of products. The horse frequently appears in coats of arms in heraldry, in a variety of poses and equipment. The mythologies of many cultures, including Greco-Roman, Hindu, Islamic, and Germanic, include references to both normal horses and those with wings or additional limbs, and multiple myths also call upon the horse to draw the chariots of the Moon and Sun. The horse also appears in the 12-year cycle of animals in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar.

Horses serve as the inspiration for many modern automobile names and logos, including the Ford Pinto, Ford Bronco, Ford Mustang, Hyundai Equus, Hyundai Pony, Mitsubishi Starion, Subaru Brumby, Mitsubishi Colt/Dodge Colt, Pinzgauer, Steyr-Puch Haflinger, Pegaso, Porsche, Rolls-Royce Camargue, Ferrari, Carlsson, Kamaz, Corre La Licorne, Iran Khodro, Eicher, and Baojun. Indian TVS Motor Company also uses a horse on their motorcycles &amp; scooters.

===Therapeutic use===

People of all ages with physical and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from an association with horses. Therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence. The benefits of equestrian activity for people with disabilities has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the Paralympic Games and recognition of para-equestrian events by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). Hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that use equine movement. In hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse&#x27;s movement to improve their patient&#x27;s cognitive, coordination, balance, and fine motor skills, whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.

Horses also provide psychological benefits to people whether they actually ride or not. &quot;Equine-assisted&quot; or &quot;equine-facilitated&quot; therapy is a form of experiential psychotherapy that uses horses as companion animals to assist people with mental illness, including anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, mood disorders, behavioral difficulties, and those who are going through major life changes. There are also experimental programs using horses in prison settings. Exposure to horses appears to improve the behavior of inmates and help reduce recidivism when they leave.

===Products===
Horses are raw material for many products made by humans throughout history, including byproducts from the slaughter of horses as well as materials collected from living horses.

Products collected from living horses include mare&#x27;s milk, used by people with large horse herds, such as the Mongols, who let it ferment to produce kumis. Horse blood was once used as food by the Mongols and other nomadic tribes, who found it a convenient source of nutrition when traveling. Drinking their own horses&#x27; blood allowed the Mongols to ride for extended periods of time without stopping to eat. The drug Premarin is a mixture of estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant mares (pregnant mares&#x27; urine), and was previously a widely used drug for hormone replacement therapy. The tail hair of horses can be used for making bows for string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.

Horse meat has been used as food for humans and carnivorous animals throughout the ages. Approximately 5 million horses are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide. It is eaten in many parts of the world, though consumption is taboo in some cultures, and a subject of political controversy in others. Horsehide leather has been used for boots, gloves, jackets, baseballs, and baseball gloves. Horse hooves can also be used to produce animal glue. Horse bones can be used to make implements. Specifically, in Italian cuisine, the horse tibia is sharpened into a probe called a &quot;spinto&quot;, which is used to test the readiness of a (pig) ham as it cures. In Asia, the &quot;saba&quot; is a horsehide vessel used in the production of kumis.

===Care===

Horses are grazing animals, and their major source of nutrients is good-quality forage from hay or pasture. They can consume approximately 2% to 2.5% of their body weight in dry feed each day. Therefore, a adult horse could eat up to of food. Sometimes, concentrated feed such as grain is fed in addition to pasture or hay, especially when the animal is very active. When grain is fed, equine nutritionists recommend that 50% or more of the animal&#x27;s diet by weight should still be forage.

Horses require a plentiful supply of clean water, a minimum of per day. Although horses are adapted to live outside, they require shelter from the wind and precipitation, which can range from a simple shed or shelter to an elaborate stable.

Horses require routine hoof care from a farrier, as well as vaccinations to protect against various diseases, and dental examinations from a veterinarian or a specialized equine dentist. If horses are kept inside in a barn, they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental well-being. When turned outside, they require well-maintained, sturdy fences to be safely contained. Regular grooming is also helpful to help the horse maintain good health of the hair coat and underlying skin.

<text>Hermann Ebbinghaus (24 January 1850 – 26 February 1909) was a German psychologist who pioneered the experimental study of memory. Ebbinghaus discovered the forgetting curve and the spacing effect. He was the first person to describe the learning curve. He was the father of the neo-Kantian philosopher Julius Ebbinghaus.

==Early life==
Ebbinghaus was born in Barmen, in the Rhine Province of the Kingdom of Prussia, as the son of a wealthy merchant, Carl Ebbinghaus. Little is known about his infancy except that he was brought up in the Lutheran faith and was a pupil at the town Gymnasium. At the age of 17 (1867), he began attending the University of Bonn, where he had planned to study history and philology. However, during his time there he developed an interest in philosophy. In 1870, his studies were interrupted when he served with the Prussian Army in the Franco-Prussian War. Following this short stint in the military, Ebbinghaus finished his dissertation on Eduard von Hartmann&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (philosophy of the unconscious) and received his doctorate on 16 August 1873, when he was 23 years old. During the next three years, he spent time at Halle and Berlin.

==Professional career==
After acquiring his PhD, Ebbinghaus moved around England and France, tutoring students to support himself. In England, he may have taught in two small schools in the south of the country (Gorfein, 1885). In London, in a used bookstore, he came across Gustav Fechner&#x27;s book &quot;Elemente der Psychophysik&quot; (&quot;Elements of Psychophysics&quot;), which spurred him to conduct memory experiments. After beginning his studies at the University of Berlin, he founded the third psychological testing lab in Germany (third to Wilhelm Wundt and Georg Elias Müller). He began his memory studies here in 1879. In 1885 — the same year that he published his monumental work, &quot;Über das Gedächtnis. Untersuchungen zur experimentellen Psychologie&quot;, later published in English under the title &quot;Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology&quot; — he was made a professor at the University of Berlin, most likely in recognition of this publication. In 1890, along with Arthur König, he founded the psychological journal &quot;Zeitschrift für Physiologie und Psychologie der Sinnesorgane&quot; (&quot;The Psychology and Physiology of the Sense Organs&#x27;&quot;).

In 1894, he was passed over for promotion to head of the philosophy department at Berlin, most likely due to his lack of publications. Instead, Carl Stumpf received the promotion. As a result of this, Ebbinghaus left to join the University of Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland), in a chair left open by Theodor Lipps (who took over Stumpf&#x27;s position when he moved to Berlin). While in Breslau, he worked on a commission that studied how children&#x27;s mental ability declined during the school day. While the specifics on how these mental abilities were measured have been lost, the successes achieved by the commission laid the groundwork for future intelligence testing. At Breslau, he again founded a psychological testing laboratory.

In 1902, Ebbinghaus published his next piece of writing entitled &quot;Die Grundzüge der Psychologie&quot; (&quot;Fundamentals of Psychology&quot;). It was an instant success and continued to be long after his death. In 1904, he moved to Halle where he spent the last few years of his life. His last published work, &quot;Abriss der Psychologie&quot; (&quot;Outline of Psychology&quot;) was published six years later, in 1908. This, too, continued to be a success, being re-released in eight different editions. Shortly after this publication, on 26 February 1909, Ebbinghaus died from pneumonia at the age of 59.

==Research on memory==
Ebbinghaus was determined to show that higher mental processes could actually be studied using experimentation, which was in opposition to the popularly held thought of the time. To control for most potentially confounding variables, Ebbinghaus wanted to use simple acoustic encoding and maintenance rehearsal for which a list of words could have been used. As learning would be affected by prior knowledge and understanding, he needed something that could be easily memorized but which had no prior cognitive associations. Easily formable associations with regular words would interfere with his results, so he used items that would later be called &quot;nonsense syllables&quot; (also known as the CVC trigram). A nonsense syllable is a consonant-vowel-consonant combination, where the consonant does not repeat and the syllable does not have prior meaning. BOL (sounds like &quot;Ball&quot;) and DOT (already a word) would then not be allowed. However, syllables such as DAX, BOK, and YAT would all be acceptable (though Ebbinghaus left no examples). After eliminating the meaning-laden syllables, Ebbinghaus ended up with 2,300 resultant syllables. Once he had created his collection of syllables, he would pull out a number of random syllables from a box and then write them down in a notebook. Then, to the regular sound of a metronome, and with the same voice inflection, he would read out the syllables, and attempt to recall them at the end of the procedure. One investigation alone required 15,000 recitations.

It was later determined that humans impose meaning even on nonsense syllables to make them more meaningful. The nonsense syllable PED (which is the first three letters of the word &quot;pedal&quot;) turns out to be less nonsensical than a syllable such as KOJ; the syllables are said to differ in association value. It appears that Ebbinghaus recognized this, and only referred to the strings of syllables as &quot;nonsense&quot; in that the syllables might be less likely to have a specific meaning and he should make no attempt to make associations with them for easier retrieval.

===Limitations===
There are several limitations to his work on memory. The most important one was that Ebbinghaus was the only subject in his study. This limited the study&#x27;s generalizability to the population. Although he attempted to regulate his daily routine to maintain more control over his results, his decision to avoid the use of participants sacrificed the external validity of the study despite sound internal validity. In addition, although he tried to account for his personal influences, there is an inherent bias when someone serves as researcher as well as participant. Also, Ebbinghaus&#x27;s memory research halted research in other, more complex matters of memory such as semantic and procedural memory and mnemonics.

===Contributions===
In 1885, he published his groundbreaking &quot;Über das Gedächtnis&quot; (&quot;On Memory&quot;, later translated to English as &quot;Memory. A Contribution to Experimental Psychology&quot;) in which he described experiments he conducted on himself to describe the processes of learning and forgetting.

Ebbinghaus made several findings that are still relevant and supported to this day. First, Ebbinghaus made a set of 2,300 three letter syllables to measure mental associations that helped him find that memory is orderly. Second, and arguably his most famous finding, was the forgetting curve. The forgetting curve describes the exponential loss of information that one has learned. The sharpest decline occurs in the first twenty minutes and the decay is significant through the first hour. The curve levels off after about one day.

The learning curve described by Ebbinghaus refers to how fast one learns information. The sharpest increase occurs after the first try and then gradually evens out, meaning that less and less new information is retained after each repetition. Like the forgetting curve, the learning curve is exponential. Ebbinghaus had also documented the serial position effect, which describes how the position of an item affects recall. The two main concepts in the serial position effect are recency and primacy. The recency effect describes the increased recall of the most recent information because it is still in the short-term memory. The primacy effect causes better memory of the first items in a list due to increased rehearsal and commitment to long-term memory.

Another important discovery is that of savings. This refers to the amount of information retained in the subconscious even after this information cannot be consciously accessed. Ebbinghaus would memorize a list of items until perfect recall and then would not access the list until he could no longer recall any of its items. He then would relearn the list, and compare the new learning curve to the learning curve of his previous memorization of the list. The second list was generally memorized faster, and this difference between the two learning curves is what Ebbinghaus called &quot;savings&quot;. Ebbinghaus also described the difference between involuntary and voluntary memory, the former occurring &quot;with apparent spontaneity and without any act of the will&quot; and the latter being brought &quot;into consciousness by an exertion of the will&quot;.

Prior to Ebbinghaus, most contributions to the study of memory were undertaken by philosophers and centered on observational description and speculation. For example, Immanuel Kant simply described recognition and its components. On the other hand,Sir Francis Bacon claimed that the simple observation of the rote recollection of a previously learned list wasn&#x27;t useful to understanding memory. This dichotomy between descriptive and experimental study of memory would resonate later in Ebbinghaus&#x27;s life, particularly in his public argument with former colleague Wilhelm Dilthey. However, more than a century before Ebbinghaus, Johann Andreas Segner invented the &quot;Segner-wheel&quot; and would use both by seeing how fast a wheel with a hot coal attached had to move for the red ember circle from the coal to appear complete (see iconic memory). He proceeded to view the length of the after images. 

Ebbinghaus&#x27;s effect on memory research was almost immediate. With very few works published on memory in the previous two millennia, Ebbinghaus&#x27;s works spurred memory research in the United States in the 1890s, with 32 papers published in 1894 alone. This research was coupled with the growing development of mechanized mnemometers (an outdated mechanical device used for presenting a series of stimuli to be memorized).

The reaction to his work in his day was mostly positive. Psychologist William James called the studies &quot;heroic&quot; and said that they were &quot;the single most brilliant investigation in the history of psychology&quot;. Edward B. Titchener also mentioned that the studies were the greatest undertaking in the topic of memory since Aristotle.

== Research on cramming ==
Ebbinghaus is the first person to compare distributed learning to cramming and one of the first people to carry out research on cramming.

==Sentence completion, illusion and research report standardization==
Ebbinghaus pioneered sentence completion exercises, which he developed in studying the abilities of schoolchildren. Alfred Binet borrowed and incorporated them into the Binet-Simon intelligence scale. Sentence completion was used extensively in memory research, especially in measuring implicit memory, and in psychotherapy to help find patients&#x27; motivations. He influenced Charlotte Bühler, who studied language meaning and society.
Ebbinghaus discovered an optical illusion now known as the Ebbinghaus illusion, based on relative size perception. Despite the large amount of research done on this and similar illusions, little is known about why it occurs, but many speculate. During the illusion, two circles of identical size are placed near each other. One is surrounded by large circles while the other is surrounded by small circles, making the first appear smaller. Factors such as the different illustrations around the circles are called inducers and targets. Many theorists and scholars believe one of the main reasons for the illusions occurring are the geometrical features surrounding the spheres. This illusion is now used extensively in cognitive psychology research, to help map perception pathways in the human brain.

Ebbinghaus drafted the first standard research report. He arranged his paper on memory into four sections: the introduction, the methods, the results, and the discussion. The clear organization of this format so impressed his contemporaries that it became standard in the discipline.

==Discourse on the nature of psychology==
In addition to pioneering experimental psychology, Ebbinghaus was also a strong defender of this direction of the new science, as is illustrated by his public dispute with University of Berlin colleague, Wilhelm Dilthey. Shortly after Ebbinghaus left Berlin in 1893, Dilthey published a paper extolling the virtues of descriptive psychology, and condemning experimental psychology as boring, claiming that the mind was too complex, and that introspection was the desired method of studying the mind. The debate at the time had been primarily whether psychology should aim to explain or understand the mind and whether it belonged to the natural or human sciences. Many had seen Dilthey&#x27;s work as an outright attack on experimental psychology, Ebbinghaus included, and he responded to Dilthey with a personal letter and also a long scathing public article. Amongst his counterarguments against Dilthey he mentioned that it is inevitable for psychology to do hypothetical work and that the kind of psychology that Dilthey was attacking was the one that existed before Ebbinghaus&#x27;s &quot;experimental revolution&quot;. Charlotte Bühler echoed his words some forty years later, stating that people like Ebbinghaus &quot;buried the old psychology in the 1890s&quot;. Ebbinghaus explained his scathing review by saying that he could not believe that Dilthey was advocating the status quo of structuralists like Wilhelm Wundt and Titchener and attempting to stifle psychology&#x27;s progress.

==Influences==
There has been some speculation as to what influenced Ebbinghaus in his undertakings. None of his professors seem to have influenced him, nor are there suggestions that his colleagues affected him. Von Hartmann&#x27;s work, on which Ebbinghaus based his doctorate, did suggest that higher mental processes were hidden from view, which may have spurred Ebbinghaus to attempt to prove otherwise. The one influence that has always been cited as having inspired Ebbinghaus was Gustav Fechner&#x27;s two-volume &quot;Elemente der Psychophysik.&quot; (&quot;Elements of Psychophysics&quot;, 1860), a book which he purchased second-hand in England. It is said that the meticulous mathematical procedures impressed Ebbinghaus so much that he wanted to do for psychology what Fechner had done for psychophysics. This inspiration is also evident in that Ebbinghaus dedicated his second work &quot;Principles of Psychology&quot; to Fechner, signing it &quot;I owe everything to you.&quot;

<text>Modern Standard Hindi (, ), commonly referred to as Hindi, is the standardised variety of the Hindustani language written in the Devanagari script. It is an official language of the Government of India, alongside English, and it is also the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of North India. Hindi is considered a Sanskritised register of Hindustani, which itself is based primarily on the Khariboli dialect of Delhi and neighbouring areas.

Hindi is an official language in nine states (Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand), and three union territories (Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Delhi, Chandigarh), and an additional official language in three other states - West Bengal, Nagaland, Mizoram. Hindi is also one of the 22 scheduled languages of the Republic of India.

Apart from the script and formal vocabulary, standard Hindi is mutually intelligible with standard Urdu, which is another recognised register of Hindustani, as both Hindi and Urdu share a core vocabulary base derived from Shauraseni Prakrit (a descendant of Vedic Sanskrit). Hindi is also spoken, to a lesser extent, in other parts of India (usually in a simplified or pidginised variety such as Bazaar Hindustani or Haflong Hindi). Outside India, several other languages are recognised officially as &quot;Hindi&quot; but do not refer to the Standard Hindi language described here and instead descend from other nearby languages, such as Awadhi and Bhojpuri. Such languages include Fiji Hindi, which has an official status in Fiji, and Caribbean Hindustani, which is spoken in Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana.

Hindi is the fourth most-spoken first language in the world, after Mandarin, Spanish, and English. When counted together with the mutually intelligible Urdu, it is the third most-spoken language in the world, after Mandarin and English. According to reports of &quot;Ethnologue&quot; (2022, 25th edition), Hindi is the third most-spoken language in the world when including first and second language speakers.

Hindi is the fastest-growing language of India, followed by Kashmiri, Meitei, Gujarati and Bengali, according to the 2011 census of India.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;Hindī&quot; was originally used to refer to inhabitants of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It was borrowed from Classical Persian &quot;Hindī&quot; (Iranian Persian pronunciation: &quot;Hendi&quot;), meaning (hence, ).

Another name &quot;Hindavī&quot; () or &quot;Hinduī&quot; () () was often used in the past, for example, by Amir Khusrau in his poetry.

The terms &quot;Hindi&quot; and &quot;Hindu&quot; trace back to Old Persian, which derived these names from the Sanskrit name &quot;Sindhu&quot; (), referring to the Indus River. The Greek cognates of the same terms are &quot;Indus&quot; (for the river) and &quot;India&quot; (for the land of the river).

The term &quot;Modern Standard Hindi&quot; is commonly used to specifically refer to the modern literary Hindi language, as opposed to colloquial and regional varieties that are also referred to as &quot;Hindi&quot; in a wider sense.

==History==
===Middle Indo-Aryan to Hindi===
Like other Indo-Aryan languages, Hindi is a direct descendant of an early form of Vedic Sanskrit, through Shauraseni Prakrit and Śauraseni Apabhraṃśa (from Sanskrit &quot;apabhraṃśa&quot; &quot;corrupt&quot;), which emerged in the 7th century CE.

The sound changes that characterised the transition from Middle Indo-Aryan to Hindi are:
* Compensatory lengthening of vowels preceding geminate consonants, sometimes with spontaneous nasalisation: Skt. &quot;hasta&quot; &quot;hand&quot; &gt; Pkt. &quot;hattha&quot; &gt; &quot;hāth&quot;
* Loss of all word-final vowels: &quot;rātri&quot; &quot;night&quot; &gt; &quot;rattī&quot; &gt; &quot;rāt&quot;
* Formation of nasalised long vowels from nasal consonants (-VNC- &gt; -V̄̃C-): &quot;bandha&quot; &quot;bond&quot; &gt; &quot;bā̃dh&quot;
* Loss of unaccented or unstressed short vowels (reflected in schwa deletion): &quot;susthira&quot; &quot;firm&quot; &gt; &quot;sutthira&quot; &gt; &quot;suthrā&quot;
* Collapsing of adjacent vowels (including separated by a hiatus: &quot;apara&quot; &quot;other&quot; &gt; &quot;avara&quot; &gt; &quot;aur&quot;
* Final &quot;-m&quot; to &quot;-ṽ&quot;: &quot;grāma&quot; &quot;village&quot; &gt; &quot;gāma&quot; &gt; &quot;gāṽ&quot;
* Intervocalic &quot;-ḍ-&quot; to &quot;-ṛ-&quot; or &quot;-l-&quot;: &quot;taḍāga&quot; &quot;pond&quot; &gt; &quot;talāv&quot;, &quot;naḍa&quot; &quot;reed&quot; &gt; &quot;nal&quot;.
* &quot;v&quot; &gt; &quot;b&quot;: &quot;vivāha&quot; &quot;marriage&quot; &gt; &quot;byāh&quot;

===Hindustani===
During the period of Delhi Sultanate in medieval India, which covered most of today&#x27;s north India, eastern Pakistan, southern Nepal and Bangladesh and which resulted in the contact of Hindu and Muslim cultures, the Sanskrit and Prakrit base of Old Hindi became enriched with loanwords from Persian, evolving into the present form of Hindustani. Hindi achieved prominence in India after it became the official language of the imperial court during the reign of Shah Jahan. It is recorded that Emperor Aurangzeb spoke in Hindvi. The Hindustani vernacular became an expression of Indian national unity during the Indian Independence movement, and continues to be spoken as the common language of the people of the northern Indian subcontinent, which is reflected in the Hindustani vocabulary of Bollywood films and songs.

Standard Hindi is based on the language that was spoken in the Ganges-Yamuna Doab (Delhi, Meerut and Saharanpur) called Khariboli; the vernacular of Delhi and the surrounding region came to replace earlier prestige languages such as Awadhi and Braj. Standard Hindi was developed by supplanting foreign loanwords from the Hindustani language and replacing them with Sanskrit words, though Standard Hindi does continue to possess several Persian loanwords. Modern Hindi became a literary language in the 19th century. Earliest examples could be found as &quot;Prēm Sāgar&quot; by Lallu Lal, &quot;Batiyāl Pachīsī&quot; of Sadal Misra, and &quot;Rānī Kētakī Kī Kahānī&quot; of Insha Allah Khan which were published in Devanagari script during the early 19th century.

John Gilchrist was principally known for his study of the Hindustani language, which was adopted as the lingua franca of northern India (including what is now present-day Pakistan) by British colonists and indigenous people. He compiled and authored &quot;An English-Hindustani Dictionary&quot;, &quot;A Grammar of the Hindoostanee Language&quot;, &quot;The Oriental Linguist&quot;, and many more. His lexicon of Hindustani was published in the Perso-Arabic script, Nāgarī script, and in Roman transliteration. In the late 19th century, a movement to further develop Hindi as a standardised form of Hindustani separate from Urdu took form. In 1881, Bihar accepted Hindi as its sole official language, replacing Urdu, and thus became the first state of India to adopt Hindi. However, in 2014, Urdu was accorded second official language status in the state.

===Independent India===
After independence, the Government of India instituted the following conventions:
* Standardisation of grammar: In 1954, the Government of India set up a committee to prepare a grammar of Hindi; The committee&#x27;s report was released in 1958 as &quot;A Basic Grammar of Modern Hindi&quot;.
* Standardisation of the orthography, using the Devanagari script, by the Central Hindi Directorate of the Ministry of Education and Culture to bring about uniformity in writing, to improve the shape of some Devanagari characters, and introducing diacritics to express sounds from other languages.

On 14 September 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India adopted Hindi written in the Devanagari script as the official language of the Republic of India replacing the previous usage of Hindustani in the Perso-Arabic script in the British Indian Empire. To this end, several stalwarts rallied and lobbied pan-India in favour of Hindi, most notably Beohar Rajendra Simha along with Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, Kaka Kalelkar, Maithili Sharan Gupt and Seth Govind Das who even debated in Parliament on this issue. As such, on the 50th birthday of Beohar Rajendra Simha on 14 September 1949, the efforts came to fruition following the adoption of Hindi as the official language. Now, it is celebrated as Hindi Day.

==Official status==

===India===
Part XVII of the Indian Constitution deals with the official language of the Indian Union. Under Article 343, the official languages of the Union have been prescribed, which includes Hindi in Devanagari script and English:

(1) The official language of the Union shall be Hindi in Devanagari script. The form of numerals to be used for the official purposes of the Union shall be the international form of Indian numerals.
(2) Notwithstanding anything in clause (1), for a period of fifteen years from the commencement of this Constitution, the English language shall continue to be used for all the official purposes of the Union for which it was being used immediately before such commencement: Provided that the President may, during the said period, by order authorise the use of the Hindi language in addition to the English language and of the Devanagari form of numerals in addition to the international form of Indian numerals for any of the official purposes of the Union.

 of the Indian constitution states:

It shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure its enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule, and by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages.

It was envisioned that Hindi would become the sole working language of the Union Government by 1965 (per directives in Article 344 (2) and Article 351), with state governments being free to function in the language of their own choice. However, widespread resistance to the imposition of Hindi on non-native speakers, especially in South India (such as those in Tamil Nadu) led to the passage of the Official Languages Act of 1963, which provided for the continued use of English indefinitely for all official purposes, although the constitutional directive for the Union Government to encourage the spread of Hindi was retained and has strongly influenced its policies.

 stipulates that the official language commission shall be constituted every ten years to recommend steps for the progressive use of Hindi language and impose restrictions on the use of the English language by the union government. In practice, the official language commissions are constantly endeavouring to promote Hindi but not imposing restrictions on English in official use by the union government.

At the state level, Hindi is the official language of the following Indian states: Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Hindi is an official language of Gujarat, along with Gujarati. It acts as an additional official language of West Bengal in blocks and sub-divisions with more than 10% of the population speaking Hindi. Similarly, Hindi is accorded the status of official language in the following Union Territories: Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.

Although there is no specification of a national language in the constitution, it is a widely held belief that Hindi is the national language of India. This is often a source of friction and contentious debate. In 2010, the Gujarat High Court clarified that Hindi is not the national language of India because the constitution does not mention it as such. 

===Fiji===
Outside Asia, the Awadhi language (an Eastern Hindi dialect) with influence from Bhojpuri, Bihari languages, Fijian and English is spoken in Fiji. It is an official language in Fiji as per the 1997 Constitution of Fiji, where it referred to it as &quot;Hindustani&quot;; however, in the 2013 Constitution of Fiji, it is simply called &quot;Fiji Hindi&quot; as the official language. It is spoken by 380,000 people in Fiji.

===Nepal===
Hindi is spoken as a first language by about 77,569 people in Nepal according to the 2011 Nepal census, and further by 1,225,950 people as a second language. A Hindi proponent, Indian-born Paramananda Jha, was elected vice-president of Nepal. He took his oath of office in Hindi in July 2008. This created protests in the streets for 5 days; students burnt his effigies, and there was a general strike in 22 districts. Nepal Supreme Court ruled in 2009 that his oath in Hindi was invalid and he was kept &quot;inactive&quot; as vice-president. An &quot;angry&quot; Jha said, &quot;I cannot be compelled to take the oath now in Nepali. I might rather take it in English.&quot;

===South Africa===
Hindi is a protected language in South Africa. According to the Constitution of South Africa, the Pan South African Language Board must promote and ensure respect for Hindi along with other languages. According to a doctoral dissertation by Rajend Mesthrie in 1985, although Hindi and other Indian languages have existed in South Africa for the last 125 years, there are no academic studies of any of them – of their use in South Africa, their evolution and current decline.

===United Arab Emirates===
Hindi is adopted as the third official court language in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. As a result of this status, the Indian workforce in UAE can file their complaints to the labour courts in the country in their own mother-tongue.

==Geographical distribution==
Hindi is the lingua franca of northern India (which contains the Hindi Belt), as well as an official language of the Government of India, along with English.

In Northeast India a pidgin known as Haflong Hindi has developed as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; for the people living in Haflong, Assam who speak other languages natively. In Arunachal Pradesh, Hindi emerged as a lingua franca among locals who speak over 50 dialects natively.

Hindi is quite easy to understand for many Pakistanis, who speak Urdu, which, like Hindi, is a standard register of the Hindustani language; additionally, Indian media are widely viewed in Pakistan.

A sizeable population in Afghanistan, especially in Kabul, can also speak and understand Hindi-Urdu due to the popularity and influence of Bollywood films, songs and actors in the region.

Hindi is also spoken by a large population of Madheshis (people having roots in north-India but having migrated to Nepal over hundreds of years) of Nepal. Apart from this, Hindi is spoken by the large Indian diaspora which hails from, or has its origin from the &quot;Hindi Belt&quot; of India. A substantially large North Indian diaspora lives in countries like the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, South Africa, Fiji and Mauritius, where it is natively spoken at home and among their own Hindustani-speaking communities.

Outside India, Hindi speakers are 8 million in Nepal; 863,077 in the United States of America; 450,170 in Mauritius; 380,000 in Fiji; 250,292 in South Africa; 150,000 in Suriname; 100,000 in Uganda; 45,800 in the United Kingdom; 20,000 in New Zealand; 20,000 in Germany; 26,000 in Trinidad and Tobago; 3,000 in Singapore.

== Comparison with Standard Urdu ==

Linguistically, Hindi and Urdu are two registers of the same language and are mutually intelligible. Both Hindi and Urdu share a core vocabulary of native Prakrit and Sanskrit-derived words. However, Hindi is written in the Devanagari script and contains more direct &quot;tatsama&quot; Sanskrit-derived words than Urdu, whereas Urdu is written in the Perso-Arabic script and uses more Arabic and Persian loanwords compared to Hindi. Because of this, as well as the fact that the two registers share an identical grammar, a consensus of linguists consider them to be two standardised forms of the same language, Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu. Hindi is the most commonly used scheduled language in India and is one of the two official languages of the union, the other being English. Urdu is the national language and &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Pakistan and is one of 22 scheduled languages of India, also having official status in Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar.

==Script==

Hindi is written in the Devanagari script, an abugida. Devanagari consists of 11 vowels and 33 consonants and is written from left to right. Unlike Sanskrit, Devanagari is not entirely phonetic for Hindi, especially failing to mark schwa deletion in spoken Standard Hindi.

===Romanisation===

The Government of India uses Hunterian transliteration as its official system of writing Hindi in the Latin script. Various other systems also exist, such as IAST, ITRANS and ISO 15919.

Romanised Hindi, also called Hinglish, is the dominant form of Hindi online. In an analysis of YouTube comments, Palakodety et al., identified that 52% of comments were in Romanised Hindi, 46% in English, and 1% in Devanagari Hindi.

== Phonology ==

==Vocabulary==

Traditionally, Hindi words are divided into five principal categories according to their etymology:

* Tatsam ( ) words: These are words which are spelled the same in Hindi as in Sanskrit (except for the absence of final case inflections). They include words inherited from Sanskrit via Prakrit which have survived without modification (e.g. Hindi &quot;nām&quot; / Sanskrit &quot;nāma&quot;, &quot;name&quot;, as well as forms borrowed directly from Sanskrit in more modern times (e.g. &quot;prārthanā&quot;, &quot;prayer&quot;). Pronunciation, however, conforms to Hindi norms and may differ from that of classical Sanskrit. Amongst nouns, the &quot;tatsam&quot; word could be the Sanskrit non-inflected word-stem, or it could be the nominative singular form in the Sanskrit nominal declension.
* Ardhatatsam ( ) words: Such words are typically earlier loanwords from Sanskrit which have undergone sound changes subsequent to being borrowed. (e.g. Hindi &quot;sūraj&quot; from Sanskrit &quot;sūrya&quot;)
* Tadbhav ( ) words: These are native Hindi words derived from Sanskrit after undergoing phonological rules (e.g. Sanskrit &quot;karma&quot;, &quot;deed&quot; becomes Shauraseni Prakrit &quot;kamma&quot;, and eventually Hindi &quot;kām&quot;, &quot;work&quot;) and are spelled differently from Sanskrit.
* Deshaj ( ) words: These are words that were not borrowings from non-indigenous languages but do not derive from attested Indo-Aryan words either. Belonging to this category are onomatopoetic words or ones borrowed from local non-Indo-Aryan languages.
* Videshī ( ) words: These include all loanwords from non-indigenous languages. The most frequent source languages in this category are Persian, Arabic, English and Portuguese. Examples are &quot;qila&quot; &quot;fort&quot; from Persian, &quot;kameṭī&quot; from English &quot;committee&quot;.

===Prakrit===
Hindi has naturally inherited a large portion of its vocabulary from Shauraseni Prakrit, in the form of &quot;tadbhava&quot; words. This process usually involves compensatory lengthening of vowels preceding consonant clusters in Prakrit, e.g. Sanskrit &quot;tīkṣṇa&quot; &gt; Prakrit &quot;tikkha&quot; &gt; Hindi &quot;tīkhā&quot;.

===Sanskrit===
Much of Standard Hindi&#x27;s vocabulary is borrowed from Sanskrit as &quot;tatsam&quot; borrowings, especially in technical and academic fields. The formal Hindi standard, from which much of the Persian, Arabic and English vocabulary has been replaced by neologisms compounding &quot;tatsam&quot; words, is called &quot;Śuddh Hindi&quot; (pure Hindi), and is viewed as a more prestigious dialect over other more colloquial forms of Hindi.

Excessive use of &quot;tatsam&quot; words sometimes creates problems for native speakers. They may have Sanskrit consonant clusters which do not exist in Hindustani, causing difficulties in pronunciation.

As a part of the process of Sanskritisation, new words are coined using Sanskrit components to be used as replacements for supposedly foreign vocabulary. Usually these neologisms are calques of English words already adopted into spoken Hindi. Some terms such as &quot;dūrbhāṣ&quot; &quot;telephone&quot;, literally &quot;far-speech&quot; and &quot;dūrdarśan&quot; &quot;television&quot;, literally &quot;far-sight&quot; have even gained some currency in formal Hindi in the place of the English borrowings &quot;(ṭeli)fon&quot; and &quot;ṭīvī&quot;.

===Persian===
Hindi also features significant Persian influence, standardised from spoken Hindustani. Early borrowings, beginning in the mid-12th century, were specific to Islam (e.g. &quot;Muhammad&quot;, &quot;Islām&quot;) and so Persian was simply an intermediary for Arabic. Later, under the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire, Persian became the primary administrative language in the Hindi heartland. Persian borrowings reached a heyday in the 17th century, pervading all aspects of life. Even grammatical constructs, namely the izafat, were assimilated into Hindi.

The status of Persian language then and thus its influence, is also visible in Hindi proverbs:

The emergence of Modern Standard Hindi in the 19th century went along with the Sanskritisation of its vocabulary, leading to a marginalisation of Persian vocabulary in Hindi, which continued after Partition when the Indian government co-opted the policy of Sanskritisation. However, many Persian words (e.g. &quot;bas&quot; &quot;enough&quot;, &quot;khud&quot; &quot;self&quot;) have remained entrenched in Standard Hindi, and a larger amount are still used in Urdu poetry written in the Devanagari script. Many words borrowed from Persian in turn were loanwords from Arabic (e.g. &quot;muśkil&quot; &quot;difficult&quot;, &quot;havā&quot; &quot;air&quot;, &quot;x(a)yāl&quot; &quot;thought&quot;, &quot;kitāb&quot; &quot;book&quot;).

*क़ानून ultimately comes from the Greek κανών (kanōn).
*क़मीज़ ultimately comes from the Latin &quot;camisia&quot; pronunciation reinforced by Portuguese &quot;camisa&quot;.

=== English ===

Hindi also makes extensive use of loan translation (calqueing) and occasionally phono-semantic matching of English.

===Portuguese===
Many Hindustani words were derived from Portuguese due to interaction with colonists and missionaries:

==Media==

===Literature===

Hindi literature is broadly divided into four prominent forms or styles, being &quot;Bhakti&quot; (devotional – Kabir, Raskhan); &quot;Śṛṇgār&quot; (beauty – Keshav, Bihari); &quot;Vīgāthā&quot; (epic); and &quot;Ādhunik&quot; (modern).

Medieval Hindi literature is marked by the influence of Bhakti movement and the composition of long, epic poems. It was primarily written in other varieties of Hindi, particularly Avadhi and Braj Bhasha, but to a degree also in Delhavi, the basis for Standard Hindi. During the British Raj, Hindustani became the prestige dialect.

&quot;Chandrakanta&quot;, written by Devaki Nandan Khatri in 1888, is considered the first authentic work of prose in modern Hindi. The person who brought realism in Hindi prose literature was Munshi Premchand, who is considered the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement. Literary, or &quot;Sāhityik&quot;, Hindi was popularised by the writings of Swami Dayananda Saraswati, Bhartendu Harishchandra and others. The rising numbers of newspapers and magazines made Hindustani popular with educated people.

The &quot;Dvivedī Yug&quot; (&quot;Age of Dwivedi&quot;) in Hindi literature lasted from 1900 to 1918. It is named after Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, who played a major role in establishing Standard Hindi in poetry and broadening the acceptable subjects of Hindi poetry from the traditional ones of religion and romantic love.

In the 20th century, Hindi literature saw a romantic upsurge. This is known as &quot;Chāyāvād&quot; (&quot;shadow-ism&quot;) and the literary figures belonging to this school are known as &quot;Chāyāvādī&quot;. Jaishankar Prasad, Suryakant Tripathi &#x27;Nirala&#x27;, Mahadevi Varma and Sumitranandan Pant, are the four major &quot;Chāyāvādī&quot; poets.

&quot;Uttar Ādhunik&quot; is the post-modernist period of Hindi literature, marked by a questioning of early trends that copied the West as well as the excessive ornamentation of the &quot;Chāyāvādī&quot; movement, and by a return to simple language and natural themes.

===Internet===
Hindi literature, music, and film have all been disseminated via the internet. In 2015, Google reported a 94% increase in Hindi-content consumption year-on-year, adding that 21% of users in India prefer content in Hindi. Many Hindi newspapers also offer digital editions.

<text>In Norse mythology, Huginn and Muninn (roughly &quot;mind and will&quot; – &quot;see &quot;) are a pair of ravens that serve under the god Odin and fly all over the world, Midgard, and bring information to the god Odin. Huginn and Muninn are attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources: the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and &quot;Heimskringla&quot;; in the &quot;Third Grammatical Treatise&quot;, compiled in the 13th century by Óláfr Þórðarson; and in the poetry of skalds. The names of the ravens are sometimes anglicized as Hugin and Munin, the same spelling as used in modern Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish.

In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, a disguised Odin expresses that he fears the ravens may not return from their daily flights. The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; explains that Odin is referred to as &quot;Hrafnaguð&quot; (O.N.: ; &quot;raven-god&quot;) due to his association with Huginn and Muninn. In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and the &quot;Third Grammatical Treatise&quot;, the two ravens are described as perching on Odin&#x27;s shoulders. &quot;Heimskringla&quot; details that Odin gave Huginn and Muninn the ability to speak.

Examples of artifacts that may depict Odin with one of the ravens include Migration Period golden bracteates, Vendel era helmet plates, a pair of identical Germanic Iron Age bird-shaped brooches, Viking Age objects depicting a moustached man wearing a helmet, and a portion of the 10th or 11th century Thorwald&#x27;s Cross. Huginn and Muninn&#x27;s role as Odin&#x27;s messengers has been linked to shamanic practices, the Norse raven banner, general raven symbolism among the Germanic peoples, and the Norse concepts of the fylgja and the hamingja.

== Etymology ==
On the surface, the names &quot;Huginn&quot; and &quot;Muninn&quot; represent Odin&#x27;s sense and mind. Their names are definitive singular forms of words which encompass various related but abstract senses. As an example, the English word &quot;mind&quot; is based on the same root word as &quot;Muninn&quot;, but encompasses the sense of &quot;Huginn&quot; when used as a noun, yet with the sense of &quot;Muninn&quot; when used as a verb. The exact clear definitions and intentions behind these names are hard to extrapolate, but they were probably close to synonyms with several shared and bordering senses.

&quot;Huginn&quot; is the definite accusative singular of (modern , &quot;hu&quot;, , , Old Swedish: &quot;hugher&quot;, &quot;hogher&quot;, modern ). It encompasses the complex meaning of mind and sense, such as &quot;thought, perception, comprehension, awareness, mood, sentiment, desire, choice etc&quot;. Cognates include (with variants: &quot;huȝe&quot;, &quot;huiȝe&quot;, &quot;hiȝe&quot;, &quot;huie&quot;, &quot;hiȝ&quot;, &quot;hie&quot;), , &quot;hiġe&quot;, , , , , , &quot;hugi&quot;, with the same meaning.

&quot;Muninn&quot; is the definite accusative singular of (modern , , , Old Swedish: &quot;mon&quot;, &quot;mun&quot;, modern ). It encompasses the complex meaning of affection, intent and will, such as &quot;care, urge, wonder, curiosity, interest, memory, prediction etc&quot;. Cognates include , , , with the same meaning, as well as and (&quot;memory, mind&quot;).

== Attestations ==
In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, the god Odin (disguised as &quot;Grímnir&quot;) provides the young Agnarr with information about Odin&#x27;s companions. He tells the prince about Odin&#x27;s wolves Geri and Freki, and, in the next stanza of the poem, states that Huginn and Muninn fly daily across the entire world, Midgard. Grímnir says that he worries Huginn may not come back, yet more does he fear for Muninn:

In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; (chapter 38), the enthroned figure of High tells Gangleri (king Gylfi in disguise) that two ravens named Huginn and Muninn sit on Odin&#x27;s shoulders. The ravens tell Odin everything they see and hear. Odin sends Huginn and Muninn out at dawn, and the birds fly all over the world before returning at dinner-time. As a result, Odin is kept informed of many events. High adds that it is from this association that Odin is referred to as &quot;raven-god&quot;. The above-mentioned stanza from &quot;Grímnismál&quot; is then quoted.

In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (chapter 60), Huginn and Muninn appear in a list of poetic names for ravens. In the same chapter, excerpts from a work by the skald Einarr Skúlason are provided. In these excerpts Muninn is referenced in a common noun for &#x27;raven&#x27; and Huginn is referenced in a kenning for &#x27;carrion&#x27;.

In the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; book &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, a euhemerized account of the life of Odin is provided. Chapter 7 describes that Odin had two ravens, and upon these ravens he bestowed the gift of speech. These ravens flew all over the land and brought him information, causing Odin to become &quot;very wise in his lore.&quot;

In the &quot;Third Grammatical Treatise&quot; an anonymous verse is recorded that mentions the ravens flying from Odin&#x27;s shoulders; Huginn seeking hanged men, and Muninn slain bodies. The verse reads:

:Two ravens flew from Hnikar’s [Óðinn’s]
:shoulders; Huginn to the hanged and
:Muninn to the slain [lit. corpses].
== Archaeological record ==
Migration Period (5th and 6th centuries CE) gold bracteates (types A, B, and C) feature a depiction of a human figure above a horse, holding a spear and flanked by one or more often two birds. The presence of the birds has led to the iconographic identification of the human figure as the god Odin, flanked by Huginn and Muninn. Like Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot; description of the ravens, a bird is sometimes depicted at the ear of the human, or at the ear of the horse. Bracteates have been found in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and, in smaller numbers, England and areas south of Denmark. Austrian Germanist Rudolf Simek states that these bracteates may depict Odin and his ravens healing a horse and may indicate that the birds were originally not simply his battlefield companions but also &quot;Odin&#x27;s helpers in his veterinary function.&quot;

Vendel era helmet plates (from the 6th or 7th century) found in a grave in Sweden depict a helmeted figure holding a spear and a shield while riding a horse, flanked by two birds. The plate has been interpreted as Odin accompanied by two birds: his ravens.

A pair of identical Germanic Iron Age bird-shaped brooches from Bejsebakke in northern Denmark may be depictions of Huginn and Muninn. The back of each bird features a mask motif, and the feet of the birds are shaped like the heads of animals. The feathers of the birds are also composed of animal heads. Together, the animal heads on the feathers form a mask on the back of the bird. The birds have powerful beaks and fan-shaped tails, indicating that they are ravens. The brooches were intended to be worn on each shoulder, after Germanic Iron Age fashion. Archaeologist Peter Vang Petersen comments that while the symbolism of the brooches is open to debate, the shape of the beaks and tail-feathers confirm that the brooch depictions are ravens. Petersen notes that &quot;raven-shaped ornaments worn as a pair, after the fashion of the day, one on each shoulder, make one&#x27;s thoughts turn toward Odin&#x27;s ravens and the cult of Odin in the Germanic Iron Age&quot;. Petersen says that Odin is associated with disguise and that the masks on the ravens may be portraits of Odin.

The Oseberg tapestry fragments, discovered within the Viking Age Oseberg ship burial in Norway, feature a scene containing two black birds hovering over a horse, possibly originally leading a wagon (as a part of a procession of horse-led wagons on the tapestry). In her examination of the tapestry, scholar Anne Stine Ingstad interprets these birds as Huginn and Muninn flying over a covered cart containing an image of Odin, drawing comparison with the images of Nerthus attested by Tacitus in 1 CE.

Excavations in Ribe in Denmark have recovered a Viking Age lead metal-caster&#x27;s mould and 11 identical casting-moulds. These objects depict a moustached man wearing a helmet that features two head-ornaments. Archaeologist Stig Jensen proposes that these ornaments should be interpreted as Huginn and Muninn, and the wearer as Odin. He notes that &quot;similar depictions occur everywhere the Vikings went—from eastern England to Russia and naturally also in the rest of Scandinavia.&quot;

A portion of Thorwald&#x27;s Cross (a partly surviving runestone erected at Kirk Andreas on the Isle of Man) depicts a bearded human holding a spear downward at a wolf, his right foot in its mouth, and a large bird on his shoulder. Andy Orchard comments that this bird may be either Huginn or Muninn. Rundata dates the cross to 940, while Pluskowski dates it to the 11th century. This depiction has been interpreted as Odin, with a raven or eagle at his shoulder, being consumed by the monstrous wolf Fenrir during the events of Ragnarök.

In November 2009, the Roskilde Museum announced the discovery and subsequent display of a niello-inlaid silver figurine found in Lejre, Denmark, which they dubbed &quot;Odin from Lejre&quot;. The silver object depicts a person sitting on a throne. The throne features the heads of animals and is flanked by two birds. The Roskilde Museum identifies the figure as Odin sitting on his throne Hliðskjálf, flanked by the ravens Huginn and Muninn.

== Interpretations ==
Scholars have linked Odin&#x27;s relation to Huginn and Muninn to shamanic practice. John Lindow relates Odin&#x27;s ability to send his &quot;thought&quot; (Huginn) and &quot;mind&quot; (Muninn) to the trance-state journey of shamans. Lindow says the &quot;Grímnismál&quot; stanza where Odin worries about the return of Huginn and Muninn &quot;would be consistent with the danger that the shaman faces on the trance-state journey.&quot;

Rudolf Simek is critical of the approach, stating that &quot;attempts have been made to interpret Odin&#x27;s ravens as a personification of the god&#x27;s intellectual powers, but this can only be assumed from the names Huginn and Muninn themselves which were unlikely to have been invented much before the 9th or 10th centuries&quot; yet that the two ravens, as Odin&#x27;s companions, appear to derive from much earlier times. Instead, Simek connects Huginn and Muninn with wider raven symbolism in the Germanic world, including the raven banner (described in English chronicles and Scandinavian sagas), a banner which was woven in a method that allowed it, when fluttering in the wind, to appear as if the raven depicted upon it was beating its wings.

Anthony Winterbourne connects Huginn and Muninn to the Norse concepts of the fylgja—a concept with three characteristics; shape-shifting abilities, good fortune, and the guardian spirit - and the hamingja - the ghostly double of a person that may appear in the form of an animal. Winterbourne states that &quot;The shaman&#x27;s journey through the different parts of the cosmos is symbolized by the &quot;hamingja&quot; concept of the shape-shifting soul, and gains another symbolic dimension for the Norse soul in the account of Oðin&#x27;s ravens, Huginn and Muninn&quot;. In response to Simek&#x27;s criticism of attempts to interpret the ravens &quot;philosophically&quot;, Winterbourne says that &quot;such speculations [...] simply strengthen the conceptual significance made plausible by other features of the mythology&quot; and that the names &quot;Huginn&quot; and &quot;Muninn&quot; &quot;demand more explanation than is usually provided&quot;.

The &quot;Heliand&quot;, an Old Saxon adaptation of the New Testament from the 9th century, differs from the New Testament in that an explicit reference is made to a dove sitting on the shoulder of Christ. Regarding this, G. Ronald Murphy says &quot;In placing the powerful white dove not just above Christ, but right on his shoulder, the &quot;Heliand&quot; author has portrayed Christ, not only as the Son of the All-Ruler, but also as a new Woden. This deliberate image of Christ triumphantly astride the land with the magnificent bird on his shoulders (the author is perhaps a bit embarrassed that the bird is an unwarlike dove!) is an image intended to calm the fears and longings of those who mourn the loss of Woden and who want to return to the old religion&#x27;s symbols and ways. With this image, Christ becomes a Germanic god, one into whose ears the Spirit of the Almighty whispers&quot;.

Bernd Heinrich theorizes that Huginn and Muninn, along with Odin and his wolves Geri and Freki, reflect a symbiosis observed in the natural world among ravens, wolves, and humans on the hunt:

:In a biological symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As in such a symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) who were part of him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered to the ends of the earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.

<text>A heat engine is a system that transfers thermal energy to do mechanical or electrical work. While originally conceived in the context of mechanical energy, the concept of the heat engine has been applied to various other kinds of energy, particularly electrical, since at least the late 19th century. The heat engine does this by bringing a working substance from a higher state temperature to a lower state temperature. A heat source generates thermal energy that brings the working substance to the higher temperature state. The working substance generates work in the working body of the engine while transferring heat to the colder sink until it reaches a lower temperature state. During this process some of the thermal energy is converted into work by exploiting the properties of the working substance. The working substance can be any system with a non-zero heat capacity, but it usually is a gas or liquid. During this process, some heat is normally lost to the surroundings and is not converted to work. Also, some energy is unusable because of friction and drag.

In general, an engine is any machine that converts energy to mechanical work. Heat engines distinguish themselves from other types of engines by the fact that their efficiency is fundamentally limited by Carnot&#x27;s theorem of thermodynamics. Although this efficiency limitation can be a drawback, an advantage of heat engines is that most forms of energy can be easily converted to heat by processes like exothermic reactions (such as combustion), nuclear fission, absorption of light or energetic particles, friction, dissipation and resistance. Since the heat source that supplies thermal energy to the engine can thus be powered by virtually any kind of energy, heat engines cover a wide range of applications.

Heat engines are often confused with the cycles they attempt to implement. Typically, the term &quot;engine&quot; is used for a physical device and &quot;cycle&quot; for the models.

== Overview ==
In thermodynamics, heat engines are often modeled using a standard engineering model such as the Otto cycle. The theoretical model can be refined and augmented with actual data from an operating engine, using tools such as an indicator diagram. Since very few actual implementations of heat engines exactly match their underlying thermodynamic cycles, one could say that a thermodynamic cycle is an ideal case of a mechanical engine. In any case, fully understanding an engine and its efficiency requires a good understanding of the (possibly simplified or idealised) theoretical model, the practical nuances of an actual mechanical engine and the discrepancies between the two.

In general terms, the larger the difference in temperature between the hot source and the cold sink, the larger is the potential thermal efficiency of the cycle. On Earth, the cold side of any heat engine is limited to being close to the ambient temperature of the environment, or not much lower than 300 kelvin, so most efforts to improve the thermodynamic efficiencies of various heat engines focus on increasing the temperature of the source, within material limits. The maximum theoretical efficiency of a heat engine (which no engine ever attains) is equal to the temperature difference between the hot and cold ends divided by the temperature at the hot end, each expressed in absolute temperature.

The efficiency of various heat engines proposed or used today has a large range:
*3% (97 percent waste heat using low quality heat) for the ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) ocean power proposal
*25% for most automotive gasoline engines
*49% for a supercritical coal-fired power station such as the Avedøre Power Station
*50%+ for long stroke marine Diesel engines 
*60% for a combined cycle gas turbine

The efficiency of these processes is roughly proportional to the temperature drop across them. Significant energy may be consumed by auxiliary equipment, such as pumps, which effectively reduces efficiency.

== Examples ==
Although some cycles have a typical combustion location (internal or external), they can often be implemented with the other. For example, John Ericsson developed an external heated engine running on a cycle very much like the earlier Diesel cycle. In addition, externally heated engines can often be implemented in open or closed cycles. In a closed cycle the working fluid is retained within the engine at the completion of the cycle whereas is an open cycle the working fluid is either exchanged with the environment together with the products of combustion in the case of the internal combustion engine or simply vented to the environment in the case of external combustion engines like steam engines and turbines.

=== Everyday examples ===
Everyday examples of heat engines include the thermal power station, internal combustion engine, firearms, refrigerators and heat pumps. Power stations are examples of heat engines run in a forward direction in which heat flows from a hot reservoir and flows into a cool reservoir to produce work as the desired product. Refrigerators, air conditioners and heat pumps are examples of heat engines that are run in reverse, i.e. they use work to take heat energy at a low temperature and raise its temperature in a more efficient way than the simple conversion of work into heat (either through friction or electrical resistance). Refrigerators remove heat from within a thermally sealed chamber at low temperature and vent waste heat at a higher temperature to the environment and heat pumps take heat from the low temperature environment and &#x27;vent&#x27; it into a thermally sealed chamber (a house) at higher temperature.

In general heat engines exploit the thermal properties associated with the expansion and compression of gases according to the gas laws or the properties associated with phase changes between gas and liquid states.

=== Earth&#x27;s heat engine ===
Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and hydrosphere—Earth&#x27;s heat engine—are coupled processes that constantly even out solar heating imbalances through evaporation of surface water, convection, rainfall, winds and ocean circulation, when distributing heat around the globe.

A Hadley cell is an example of a heat engine. It involves the rising of warm and moist air in the earth&#x27;s equatorial region and the descent of colder air in the subtropics creating a thermally driven direct circulation, with consequent net production of kinetic energy.

=== Phase-change cycles ===
In phase change cycles and engines, the working fluids are gases and liquids. The engine converts the working fluid from a gas to a liquid, from liquid to gas, or both, generating work from the fluid expansion or compression.
*Rankine cycle (classical steam engine)
*Regenerative cycle (steam engine more efficient than Rankine cycle)
*Organic Rankine cycle (Coolant changing phase in temperature ranges of ice and hot liquid water)
*Vapor to liquid cycle (drinking bird, injector, Minto wheel)
*Liquid to solid cycle (frost heaving – water changing from ice to liquid and back again can lift rock up to 60 cm.)
*Solid to gas cycle (firearms – solid propellants combust to hot gases.)

=== Gas-only cycles ===
In these cycles and engines the working fluid is always a gas (i.e., there is no phase change):
*Carnot cycle (Carnot heat engine)
*Ericsson cycle (Caloric Ship John Ericsson)
*Stirling cycle (Stirling engine, thermoacoustic devices)
*Internal combustion engine (ICE):
**Otto cycle (e.g. gasoline/petrol engine)
**Diesel cycle (e.g. Diesel engine)
**Atkinson cycle (Atkinson engine)
**Brayton cycle or Joule cycle originally Ericsson cycle (gas turbine)
**Lenoir cycle (e.g., pulse jet engine)
**Miller cycle (Miller engine)

=== Liquid-only cycles ===
In these cycles and engines the working fluid are always like liquid:
*Stirling cycle (Malone engine)

=== Electron cycles ===
*Johnson thermoelectric energy converter
*Thermoelectric (Peltier–Seebeck effect)
*Thermogalvanic cell
*Thermionic emission
*Thermotunnel cooling

=== Magnetic cycles ===
*Thermo-magnetic motor (Tesla)

=== Cycles used for refrigeration ===

A domestic refrigerator is an example of a heat pump: a heat engine in reverse. Work is used to create a heat differential. Many cycles can run in reverse to move heat from the cold side to the hot side, making the cold side cooler and the hot side hotter. Internal combustion engine versions of these cycles are, by their nature, not reversible.

Refrigeration cycles include:
*Air cycle machine
*Gas-absorption refrigerator
*Magnetic refrigeration
*Stirling cryocooler
*Vapor-compression refrigeration
*Vuilleumier cycle

=== Evaporative heat engines ===
The Barton evaporation engine is a heat engine based on a cycle producing power and cooled moist air from the evaporation of water into hot dry air.

=== Mesoscopic heat engines ===
Mesoscopic heat engines are nanoscale devices that may serve the goal of processing heat fluxes and perform useful work at small scales. Potential applications include e.g. electric cooling devices. In such mesoscopic heat engines, work per cycle of operation fluctuates due to thermal noise. There is exact equality that relates average of exponents of work performed by any heat engine and the heat transfer from the hotter heat bath. This relation transforms the Carnot&#x27;s inequality into exact equality. This relation is also a Carnot cycle equality

== Efficiency ==
The efficiency of a heat engine relates how much useful work is output for a given amount of heat energy input.

From the laws of thermodynamics, after a completed cycle:
:formula_1
:and therefore
:formula_2
:where
:formula_3 is the net work extracted from the engine in one cycle. (It is negative, in the IUPAC convention, since work is &quot;done by&quot; the engine.)
:formula_4 is the heat energy taken from the high temperature heat source in the surroundings in one cycle. (It is positive since heat energy is &quot;added&quot; to the engine.)
:formula_5 is the waste heat given off by the engine to the cold temperature heat sink. (It is negative since heat is &quot;lost&quot; by the engine to the sink.)

In other words, a heat engine absorbs heat energy from the high temperature heat source, converting part of it to useful work and giving off the rest as waste heat to the cold temperature heat sink.

In general, the efficiency of a given heat transfer process is defined by the ratio of &quot;what is taken out&quot; to &quot;what is put in&quot;. (For a refrigerator or heat pump, which can be considered as a heat engine run in reverse, this is the coefficient of performance and it is ≥ 1.) In the case of an engine, one desires to extract work and has to put in heat formula_6, for instance from combustion of a fuel, so the engine efficiency is reasonably defined as
:formula_7

The efficiency is less than 100% because of the waste heat formula_8 unavoidably lost to the cold sink (and corresponding compression work put in) during the required recompression at the cold temperature before the power stroke of the engine can occur again.

The &quot;theoretical&quot; maximum efficiency of any heat engine depends only on the temperatures it operates between. This efficiency is usually derived using an ideal imaginary heat engine such as the Carnot heat engine, although other engines using different cycles can also attain maximum efficiency. Mathematically, after a full cycle, the overall change of entropy is zero:

formula_9

Note that formula_10 is positive because isothermal expansion in the power stroke increases the multiplicity of the working fluid while formula_11 is negative since recompression decreases the multiplicity. If the engine is ideal and runs reversibly, formula_12 and formula_13, and thus

formula_14,

which gives formula_15 and thus the Carnot limit for heat-engine efficiency,
:formula_16

where formula_17 is the absolute temperature of the hot source and formula_18 that of the cold sink, usually measured in kelvins.

The reasoning behind this being the maximal efficiency goes as follows. It is first assumed that if a more efficient heat engine than a Carnot engine is possible, then it could be driven in reverse as a heat pump. Mathematical analysis can be used to show that this assumed combination would result in a net decrease in entropy. Since, by the second law of thermodynamics, this is statistically improbable to the point of exclusion, the Carnot efficiency is a theoretical upper bound on the reliable efficiency of &quot;any&quot; thermodynamic cycle.

Empirically, no heat engine has ever been shown to run at a greater efficiency than a Carnot cycle heat engine.

Figure 2 and Figure 3 show variations on Carnot cycle efficiency with temperature. Figure 2 indicates how efficiency changes with an increase in the heat addition temperature for a constant compressor inlet temperature. Figure 3 indicates how the efficiency changes with an increase in the heat rejection temperature for a constant turbine inlet temperature.

=== Endo-reversible heat-engines ===
By its nature, any maximally efficient Carnot cycle must operate at an infinitesimal temperature gradient; this is because any transfer of heat between two bodies of differing temperatures is irreversible, therefore the Carnot efficiency expression applies only to the infinitesimal limit. The major problem is that the objective of most heat-engines is to output power, and infinitesimal power is seldom desired.

A different measure of ideal heat-engine efficiency is given by considerations of endoreversible thermodynamics, where the system is broken into reversible subsystems, but with non reversible interactions between them. A classical example is the Curzon–Ahlborn engine, very similar to a Carnot engine, but where the thermal reservoirs at temperature formula_17 and formula_18 are allowed to be different from the temperatures of the substance going through the reversible Carnot cycle: formula_21 and formula_22. The heat transfers between the reservoirs and the substance are considered as conductive (and irreversible) in the form formula_23. In this case, a tradeoff has to be made between power output and efficiency. If the engine is operated very slowly, the heat flux is low, formula_24 and the classical Carnot result is found
:formula_25,
but at the price of a vanishing power output. If instead one chooses to operate the engine at its maximum output power, the efficiency becomes
:formula_26 (Note: &quot;T&quot; in units of K or °R)

This model does a better job of predicting how well real-world heat-engines can do (Callen 1985, see also endoreversible thermodynamics):

As shown, the Curzon–Ahlborn efficiency much more closely models that observed.

== History ==

Heat engines have been known since antiquity but were only made into useful devices at the time of the industrial revolution in the 18th century. They continue to be developed today.

== Enhancements ==
Engineers have studied the various heat-engine cycles to improve the amount of usable work they could extract from a given power source. The Carnot cycle limit cannot be reached with any gas-based cycle, but engineers have found at least two ways to bypass that limit and one way to get better efficiency without bending any rules:
#Increase the temperature difference in the heat engine. The simplest way to do this is to increase the hot side temperature, which is the approach used in modern combined-cycle gas turbines. Unfortunately, physical limits (such as the melting point of the materials used to build the engine) and environmental concerns regarding NOx production (if the heat source is combustion with ambient air) restrict the maximum temperature on workable heat-engines. Modern gas turbines run at temperatures as high as possible within the range of temperatures necessary to maintain acceptable NOx output . Another way of increasing efficiency is to lower the output temperature. One new method of doing so is to use mixed chemical working fluids, then exploit the changing behavior of the mixtures. One of the most famous is the so-called Kalina cycle, which uses a 70/30 mix of ammonia and water as its working fluid. This mixture allows the cycle to generate useful power at considerably lower temperatures than most other processes.
#Exploit the physical properties of the working fluid. The most common such exploitation is the use of water above the critical point (supercritical water). The behavior of fluids above their critical point changes radically, and with materials such as water and carbon dioxide it is possible to exploit those changes in behavior to extract greater thermodynamic efficiency from the heat engine, even if it is using a fairly conventional Brayton or Rankine cycle. A newer and very promising material for such applications is supercritical CO2. SO2 and xenon have also been considered for such applications. Downsides include issues of corrosion and erosion, the different chemical behavior above and below the critical point, the needed high pressures and – in the case of sulfur dioxide and to a lesser extent carbon dioxide – toxicity. Among the mentioned compounds xenon is least suitable for use in a nuclear reactor due to the high neutron absorption cross section of almost all isotopes of xenon, whereas carbon dioxide and water can also double as a neutron moderator for a thermal spectrum reactor.
#Exploit the chemical properties of the working fluid. A fairly new and novel exploit is to use exotic working fluids with advantageous chemical properties. One such is nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a toxic component of smog, which has a natural dimer as di-nitrogen tetraoxide (N2O4). At low temperature, the N2O4 is compressed and then heated. The increasing temperature causes each N2O4 to break apart into two NO2 molecules. This lowers the molecular weight of the working fluid, which drastically increases the efficiency of the cycle. Once the NO2 has expanded through the turbine, it is cooled by the heat sink, which makes it recombine into N2O4. This is then fed back by the compressor for another cycle. Such species as aluminium bromide (Al2Br6), NOCl, and Ga2I6 have all been investigated for such uses. To date, their drawbacks have not warranted their use, despite the efficiency gains that can be realized.

== Heat engine processes ==
Each process is one of the following:
*isothermal (at constant temperature, maintained with heat added or removed from a heat source or sink)
*isobaric (at constant pressure)
*isometric/isochoric (at constant volume), also referred to as iso-volumetric
*adiabatic (no heat is added or removed from the system during adiabatic process)
*isentropic (reversible adiabatic process, no heat is added or removed during isentropic process)

<text>In Norse mythology, Heimdall (from Old Norse Heimdallr; modern Icelandic Heimdallur) is a god. He is the son of Odin and nine mothers. Heimdall keeps watch for invaders and the onset of Ragnarök from his dwelling Himinbjörg, where the burning rainbow bridge Bifröst meets the sky. He is attested as possessing foreknowledge and keen senses, particularly eyesight and hearing. The god and his possessions are described in enigmatic manners. For example, Heimdall is golden-toothed, &quot;the head is called his sword,&quot; and he is &quot;the whitest of the gods.&quot;

Heimdall possesses the resounding horn Gjallarhorn and the golden-maned horse Gulltoppr, along with a store of mead at his dwelling. He is the son of Nine Mothers, and he is said to be the originator of social classes among humanity. Other notable stories include the recovery of Freyja&#x27;s treasured possession Brísingamen while doing battle in the shape of a seal with Loki. The antagonistic relationship between Heimdall and Loki is notable, as they are foretold to kill one another during the events of Ragnarök. Heimdallr is also known as Rig, Hallinskiði, Gullintanni, and Vindlér or Vindhlér.

Heimdall is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material; in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, both written in the 13th century; in the poetry of skalds; and likely in a runic inscription on the Saltfleetby spindle-whorl found in England. Two lines of an otherwise lost poem about the god, &quot;Heimdalargaldr&quot;, survive. Due to the enigmatic nature of these attestations, scholars have produced various theories about the nature of the god, including his relation to sheep, borders, and waves.

==Names and etymology==
The etymology of the name is obscure, but &#x27;the one who illuminates the world&#x27; has been proposed. &quot;Heimdallr&quot; may be connected to &quot;Mardöll&quot;, one of Freyja&#x27;s names. &quot;Heimdallr&quot; and its variants are usually anglicized as &quot;Heimdall&quot; (; with the nominative &quot;-r&quot; dropped).

Heimdall is attested as having three other names; &quot;Hallinskiði&quot;, &quot;Gullintanni&quot;, and &quot;Vindlér&quot; or &quot;Vindhlér&quot;. The name &quot;Hallinskiði&quot; is obscure, but has resulted in a series of attempts at deciphering it. &quot;Gullintanni&quot; literally means &#x27;the one with the golden teeth&#x27;. &quot;Vindlér&quot; (or &quot;Vindhlér&quot;) translates as either &#x27;the one protecting against the wind&#x27; or &#x27;wind-sea&#x27;. All three have resulted in numerous theories about the god.

==Attestations==
===Saltfleetby spindle-whorl inscription===

Heimdallr is likely mentioned on the Saltfleetby spindle-whorl, a lead spindle whorl bearing an Old Norse Younger Fuþark inscription that was discovered in Saltfleetby in eastern England in 2010. The spindle-whorl itself is dated from the 10th to 12th centuries CE, with the writing possibly being added significantly after the object was made. Whilst there are difficulties in interpreting the inscription, it likely records a charm asking for help from Odin, Heimdallr and , a figure whose name closely resembles that of Þjálfi, one of Thor&#x27;s servants. The religion of the writer is debated, with the invoking of Germanic gods not procluding adherence to Christianity, but also possibly attesting to the continuing of Old Nordic religion in some English communities significantly after the establishment of Christianity in the region.

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, Heimdall is attested in six poems; &quot;Völuspá&quot;, &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, &quot;Þrymskviða&quot;, &quot;Rígsþula&quot;, and &quot;Hrafnagaldr Óðins&quot;.

Heimdall is mentioned three times in &quot;Völuspá&quot;. In the first stanza of the poem, the undead völva reciting the poem calls out for listeners to be silent and refers to the Norse god:

This stanza has led to various scholarly interpretations. The &quot;holy races&quot; have been considered variously as either humanity or the gods. The notion of humanity as &quot;Heimdall&#x27;s sons&quot; is otherwise unattested and has also resulted in various interpretations. Some scholars have pointed to the prose introduction to the poem &quot;Rígsþula&quot;, where Heimdall is said to have once gone about people, slept between couples, and so doled out classes among them (see &quot;Rígsthula&quot; section below).

Later in &quot;Völuspá&quot;, the völva foresees the events of Ragnarök and the role in which Heimdall and Gjallarhorn will play at its onset; Heimdall will raise his horn and blow loudly. Due to manuscript differences, translations of the stanza vary:
Regarding this stanza, scholar Andy Orchard comments that the name &quot;Gjallarhorn&quot; may here mean &quot;horn of the river Gjöll&quot; as &quot;Gjöll is the name of one of the rivers of the Underworld, whence much wisdom is held to derive&quot;, but notes that in the poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot; Heimdall is said to drink fine mead in his heavenly home Himinbjörg.

Earlier in the same poem, the völva mentions a scenario involving the hearing or horn (depending on translation of the Old Norse noun &quot;hljóð&quot;—translations bolded below for the purpose of illustration) of the god Heimdall:

Scholar Paul Schach comments that the stanzas in this section of &quot; Völuspá&quot; are &quot;all very mysterious and obscure, as it was perhaps meant to be&quot;. Schach details that &quot;&quot;Heimdallar hljóð&quot; has aroused much speculation. Snorri [in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;] seems to have confused this word with &quot;gjallarhorn&quot;, but there is otherwise no attestation of the use of &quot;hljóð&quot; in the sense of &#x27;horn&#x27; in Icelandic. Various scholars have read this as &quot;hearing&quot; rather than &quot;horn&quot;.

Scholar Carolyne Larrington comments that if &quot;hearing&quot; rather than &quot;horn&quot; is understood to appear in this stanza, the stanza indicates that Heimdall, like Odin, has left a body part in the well; his ear. Larrington says that &quot;Odin exchanged one of his eyes for wisdom from Mimir, guardian of the well, while Heimdall seems to have forfeited his ear.&quot;

In the poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, Odin (disguised as &quot;Grímnir&quot;), tortured, starved and thirsty, tells the young Agnar of a number of mythological locations. The eighth location he mentions is Himinbjörg, where he says that Heimdall drinks fine mead:

Regarding the above stanza, Henry Adams Bellows comments that &quot;in this stanza the two functions of Heimdall—as father of humanity [ . . . ] and as warder of the gods—seem both to be mentioned, but the second line in the manuscripts is apparently in bad shape, and in the editions it is more or less conjecture&quot;.

In the poem &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, Loki flyts with various gods who have met together to feast. At one point during the exchanges, the god Heimdall says that Loki is drunk and witless, and asks Loki why he won&#x27;t stop speaking. Loki tells Heimdall to be silent, that he was fated a &quot;hateful life&quot;, that Heimdall must always have a muddy back, and that he must serve as watchman of the gods. The goddess Skaði interjects and the flyting continues in turn.

The poem &quot;Þrymskviða&quot; tells of Thor&#x27;s loss of his hammer, Mjöllnir, to the jötnar and quest to get it back. At one point in the tale, the gods gather at the thing and debate how to get Thor&#x27;s hammer back from the jötnar, who demand the beautiful goddess Freyja in return for it. Heimdall advises that they simply dress Thor up as Freyja, during which he is described as &quot;hvítastr ása&quot; (translations of the phrase vary below) and is said to have foresight like the Vanir, a group of gods:

Regarding Heimdall&#x27;s status as &quot;hvítastr ása&quot; (variously translated above as &quot;brightest&quot; (Thorpe), &quot;whitest&quot; (Bellows), and &quot;most glittering&quot; (Dodds)) and the comparison to the Vanir, scholar John Lindow comments that there are no other indications of Heimdall being considered among the Vanir (on Heimdall&#x27;s status as &quot;hvítastr ása &quot;, see &quot;scholarly reception&quot; below).

The introductory prose to the poem &quot;Rígsþula&quot; says that &quot;people say in the old stories&quot; that Heimdall, described as a god among the Æsir, once fared on a journey. Heimdall wandered along a seashore, and referred to himself as &quot;Rígr&quot;. In the poem, Rígr, who is described as a wise and powerful god, walks in the middle of roads on his way to steads, where he meets a variety of couples and dines with them, giving them advice and spending three nights at a time between them in their bed. The wives of the couples become pregnant, and from them come the various classes of humanity.

Eventually a warrior home produces a promising boy, and as the boy grows older, Rígr comes out of a thicket, teaches the boy runes, gives him a name, and proclaims him to be his son. Rígr tells him to strike out and get land for himself. The boy does so, and so becomes a great war leader with many estates. He marries a beautiful woman and the two have many children and are happy. One of the children eventually becomes so skilled that he is able to share in runic knowledge with Heimdall, and so earns the title of &quot;Rígr&quot; himself. The poem breaks off without further mention of the god.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Heimdall is mentioned in the books &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, and &quot;Háttatal&quot;. In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, the enthroned figure of High tells the disguised mythical king Gangleri of various gods, and, in chapter 25, mentions Heimdall. High says that Heimdall is known as &quot;the white As&quot;, is &quot;great and holy&quot;, and that nine maidens, all sisters, gave birth to him. Heimdall is called &quot;Hallinskiði&quot; and &quot;Gullintanni&quot;, and he has gold teeth. High continues that Heimdall lives in &quot;a place&quot; called Himinbjörg and that it is near Bifröst. Heimdall is the watchman of the gods, and he sits on the edge of heaven to guard the Bifröst bridge from the berg jötnar. Heimdall requires less sleep than a bird, can see at night just as well as if it were day, and for over a hundred leagues. Heimdall&#x27;s hearing is also quite keen; he can hear grass as it grows on the earth, wool as it grows on sheep, and anything louder. Heimdall possesses a trumpet, Gjallarhorn, that, when blown, can be heard in all worlds, and &quot;the head is referred to as Heimdall&#x27;s sword&quot;. High then quotes the above-mentioned &quot;Grímnismál&quot; stanza about Himinbjörg and provides two lines from the otherwise lost poem about Heimdall, &quot;Heimdalargaldr&quot;, in which he proclaims himself to be the son of Nine Mothers.

In chapter 49, High tells of the god Baldr&#x27;s funeral procession. Various deities are mentioned as having attended, including Heimdall, who there rode his horse Gulltopr.

In chapter 51, High foretells the events of Ragnarök. After the enemies of the gods will gather at the plain Vígríðr, Heimdall will stand and mightily blow into Gjallarhorn. The gods will awake and assemble together at the thing. At the end of the battle between various gods and their enemies, Heimdall will face Loki and they will kill one another. After, the world will be engulfed in flames. High then quotes the above-mentioned stanza regarding Heimdall raising his horn in &quot;Völuspá&quot;.

At the beginning of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Heimdall is mentioned as having attended a banquet in Asgard with various other deities. Later in the book, &quot;Húsdrápa&quot;, a poem by 10th century skald Úlfr Uggason, is cited, during which Heimdall is described as having ridden to Baldr&#x27;s funeral pyre.

In chapter 8, means of referring to Heimdall are provided; &quot;son of nine mothers&quot;, &quot;guardian of the gods&quot;, &quot;the white As&quot; (see &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; discussion regarding &quot;hvítastr ása&quot; above), &quot;Loki&#x27;s enemy&quot;, and &quot;recoverer of Freyja&#x27;s necklace&quot;. The section adds that the poem &quot;Heimdalargaldr&quot; is about him, and that, since the poem, &quot;the head has been called Heimdall&#x27;s doom: man&#x27;s doom is an expression for sword&quot;. Hiemdallr is the owner of Gulltoppr, is also known as Vindhlér, and is a son of Odin. Heimdall visits Vágasker and Singasteinn and there vied with Loki for Brísingamen. According to the chapter, the skald Úlfr Uggason composed a large section of his &quot;Húsdrápa&quot; about these events and that &quot;Húsdrápa&quot; says that the two were in the shape of seals. A few chapters later, ways of referring to Loki are provided, including &quot;wrangler with Heimdall and Skadi&quot;, and section of Úlfr Uggason&#x27;s &quot;Húsdrápa&quot; is then provided in reference:

Renowned defender [Heimdall] of the powers&#x27; way [Bifrost], kind of counsel, competes with Farbauti&#x27;s terribly sly son at Singastein. Son of eight mothers plus one, might of mood, is first to get hold of the beautiful sea-kidney [jewel, Brisingamen]. I announce it in strands of praise.

The chapter points out that in the above &quot;Húsdrápa&quot; section Heimdall is said to be the son of nine mothers.

Heimdall is mentioned once in &quot;Háttatal&quot;. There, in a composition by Snorri Sturluson, a sword is referred to as &quot;Vindhlér&#x27;s helmet-filler&quot;, meaning &quot;Heimdall&#x27;s head&quot;.

===&quot;Heimskringla&quot;===
In &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; compiled in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, Snorri presents a euhemerized origin of the Norse gods and rulers descending from them. In chapter 5, Snorri asserts that the Æsir settled in what is now Sweden and built various temples. Snorri writes that Odin settled in Lake Logrin &quot;at a place which formerly was called Sigtúnir. There he erected a large temple and made sacrifices according to the custom of the Æsir. He took possession of the land as far as he had called it Sigtúnir. He gave dwelling places to the temple priests.&quot; Snorri adds that, after this, Njörðr dwelt in Nóatún, Freyr dwelt in Uppsala, Heimdall at Himinbjörg, Thor at Þrúðvangr, Baldr at Breiðablik and that to everyone Odin gave fine estates.

==Visual depictions==

A figure holding a large horn to his lips and clasping a sword on his hip appears on a stone cross from the Isle of Man. Some scholars have theorized that this figure is a depiction of Heimdall with Gjallarhorn.

A 9th or 10th century Gosforth Cross in Cumbria, England depicts a figure holding a horn and a sword standing defiantly before two open-mouthed beasts. This figure has been often theorized as depicting Heimdall with Gjallarhorn.

==Scholarly reception==
Heimdall&#x27;s attestations have proven troublesome and enigmatic to interpret for scholars. A variety of sources describe the god as born from Nine Mothers, a puzzling description (for more in-depth discussion, see Nine Mothers of Heimdallr). Various scholars have interpreted this as a reference to the Nine Daughters of Ægir and Rán, personifications of waves. This would therefore mean Heimdall is born from the waves, an example of a deity born from the sea.

In the textual corpus, Heimdall is frequently described as maintaining a particular association with boundaries, borders, and liminal spaces, both spatial and temporal. For example, &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; describes the god as guarding the border of the land of the gods, Heimdall meets humankind at a coast, and, if accepted as describing Heimdall, &quot;Völuspá hin skamma&quot; describes him as born &#x27;at the edge of the world&#x27; in &#x27;days of yore&#x27; by the Nine Daughters of Ægir and Rán, and it is Heimdall&#x27;s horn that signals the transition to the events of Ragnarök.

Additionally, Heimdall has a particular association with male sheep, rams. A form of the deity&#x27;s name, &quot;Heimdali&quot;, occurs twice as a name for &#x27;ram&#x27; in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, as does Heimdall&#x27;s name &quot;Hallinskíði&quot;. Heimdall&#x27;s unusual physical description has also been seen by various scholars as fitting this association: As mentioned above, Heimdall is described as gold-toothed (by way of his name &quot;Gullintanni&quot;), as having the ability to hear grass grow and the growth of wool on sheep, and as owning a sword called &#x27;head&#x27; (rams have horns on their heads). This may mean that Heimdall was associated with the ram perhaps as a sacred and/or sacrificial animal or that the ancient Scandinavians may have conceived of him as having been a ram in appearance.

All of these topics—Heimdall&#x27;s birth, his association with borders and boundaries, and his connection to sheep—have led to significant discussion among scholars. For example, influential philologist and folklorist Georges Dumézil, comparing motifs and clusters of motifs in western Europe, proposes the following explanation for Heimdall&#x27;s birth and association with rams (italics are Dumézil&#x27;s own):

==In popular culture==
As with many aspects of Norse mythology, Heimdall has appeared in many modern works. Heimdall appears as a character in Marvel Comics and is portrayed in the film versions by English actor Idris Elba.

Heimdall is the namesake of a crater on Callisto, a moon of Jupiter.

Heimdall is the protagonist of an eponymous video game released in 1991 and its 1994 sequel, &quot;Heimdall 2&quot;. In the 2002 Ensemble Studios game &quot;Age of Mythology&quot;, Heimdall is one of 12 gods the Norse can choose to worship. Heimdallr is one of the playable gods in the multiplayer online battle arena game &quot;Smite&quot;. Heimdall also appears as an antagonist in the 2022 action-adventure video game &quot;God of War Ragnarök&quot; and is played by the American actor Scott Porter.

<doc id="13658" wikidata="Q11007" url="?curid=13658" title="House of Lords">
<text>The House of Lords is the upper house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Like the lower house, the House of Commons, it meets in the Palace of Westminster in London, England. One of the oldest extant institutions in the world, its origins lie in the early 11th century and the emergence of bicameralism in the 13th century.

In contrast to the House of Commons, membership of the Lords is not generally acquired by election. Most members are appointed for life, on either a political or non-political basis. Hereditary membership was limited in 1999 to 92 excepted hereditary peers: 90 elected through internal by-elections, plus the Earl Marshal and Lord Great Chamberlain as members &quot;ex officio&quot;. No members directly inherit their seats any longer. The House of Lords also includes up to 26 archbishops and bishops of the Church of England, known as Lords Spiritual. Since 2014, membership may be voluntarily relinquished or terminated upon expulsion.

As the upper house of Parliament, the House of Lords has many similar functions to the House of Commons. It scrutinises legislation, holds the government to account, and considers and reports upon public policy. Peers may also seek to introduce legislation or propose amendments to bills. While it is unable to prevent bills passing into law, except in certain limited circumstances, it may delay the enactment of bills for up to one year. In this capacity, as a body independent from the pressures of the political process, the House of Lords is said to act as a &quot;revising chamber&quot; focusing on legislative detail, while occasionally asking the House of Commons to reconsider its plans.

While peers may also serve as government ministers, they are typically only selected to serve as junior ministers, except for the Leader of the House of Lords. The House of Lords does not control the term of the prime minister or of the government; only the Commons may vote to require the prime minister to resign or call an election. Unlike the House of Commons, which has a defined number of seats, the number of members in the House of Lords is not fixed. , it has sitting members. The House of Lords is the only upper house of any bicameral parliament in the world to be larger than its lower house, and is the second-largest legislative chamber in the world, behind the National People&#x27;s Congress of China.

The King&#x27;s Speech is delivered in the House of Lords chamber during the State Opening of Parliament. In addition to its role as the upper house, the House of Lords, through the Law Lords, acted as the final court of appeal in the United Kingdom judicial system until the establishment of the Supreme Court in 2009. The House of Lords also has a Church of England role, in that Church Measures must be tabled within the House by the Lords Spiritual.

==History==
Today&#x27;s Parliament of the United Kingdom largely descends, in practice, from the Parliament of England, through the Treaty of Union of 1706 and the Acts of Union that implemented and executed the Treaty in 1707 and created a new Parliament of Great Britain to replace the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. This new parliament was, in effect, the continuation of the Parliament of England with the addition of 45 Members of Parliament (MPs) and 16 Peers to represent Scotland.

===Early history===
The House of Lords developed from the &quot;Great Council&quot; (&quot;Magnum Concilium&quot;) that advised the king during medieval times, dating back to the early 11th century. This royal council came to be composed of ecclesiastics, noblemen, and representatives of the counties of England and Wales (afterwards, representatives of the boroughs as well). The first English Parliament is often considered to be either Simon de Montfort&#x27;s Parliament (held in 1265) or the &quot;Model Parliament&quot; (held in 1295), which included archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, barons, and representatives of the shires and boroughs.

The power of Parliament grew slowly, fluctuating as the strength of the monarchy grew or declined. For example, during much of the reign of Edward II (1307–1327), the nobility was supreme, the Crown weak, and the shire and borough representatives entirely powerless.

During the reign of King Edward II&#x27;s successor, Edward III, Parliament clearly separated into two distinct chambers: the House of Commons (consisting of the shire and borough representatives) and the House of Lords (consisting of the archbishops, bishops, abbots and nobility). The authority of Parliament continued to grow, and during the early 15th century both Houses exercised powers to an extent not seen before. The Lords were far more powerful than the Commons because of the great influence of the great landowners and the prelates of the realm.

The power of the nobility declined during the civil wars of the late 15th century, known as the Wars of the Roses. Much of the nobility was killed on the battlefield or executed for participation in the war, and many aristocratic estates were lost to the Crown. Moreover, feudalism was dying, and the feudal armies controlled by the barons became obsolete. Henry VII (1485–1509) clearly established the supremacy of the monarch, symbolised by the &quot;Crown Imperial&quot;. The domination of the Sovereign continued to grow during the reigns of the Tudor monarchs in the 16th century. The Crown was at the height of its power during the reign of Henry VIII (1509–1547).

===17th–18th century===
The House of Lords remained more powerful than the House of Commons, but the lower house continued to grow in influence, reaching a zenith in relation to the House of Lords during the middle of the 17th century. Conflicts between the king and the Parliament (for the most part, the House of Commons) ultimately led to the English Civil War during the 1640s. In 1649, after the defeat and execution of King Charles I, the Commonwealth of England was declared, but the nation was effectively under the overall control of Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland.

The House of Lords was reduced to a largely powerless body, with Cromwell and his supporters in the Commons dominating the government. On 19 March 1649, the House of Lords was abolished by an act of Parliament, which declared that &quot;The Commons of England [find] by too long experience that the House of Lords is useless and dangerous to the people of England.&quot; The House of Lords did not assemble again until the Convention Parliament met in 1660 and the monarchy was restored. It returned to its former position as the more powerful chamber of Parliament—a position it would occupy until the 19th century.

After the Acts of Union 1707, the peerage of Scotland elected sixteen of their number, the Scottish representative peers, to sit in the House of Lords. General elections were held with each Parliament, and by-elections to fill vacancies in between. The elections ceased after the Peerage Act 1963 granted all peers of Scotland an hereditary seat in the House of Lords.

The first election of Scottish representative peers took place on 15 February 1707 at the Parliament House, Edinburgh, shortly before the Parliament of Scotland was adjourned for the last time on 25 March. The commissioners for the barons and the burghs chose their representatives to the British House of Commons at the same time.


===19th century===
The 19th century was marked by several changes to the House of Lords. The House, once a body of only about 50 members, had been greatly enlarged by the liberality of George III and his successors in creating peerages. The individual influence of a Lord of Parliament was thus diminished.

Moreover, the power of the House as a whole decreased, whilst that of the House of Commons grew. Particularly notable in the development of the Lower House&#x27;s superiority was the Reform Act 1832. The electoral system of the House of Commons was far from democratic: property qualifications greatly restricted the size of the electorate, and the boundaries of many constituencies had not been changed for centuries. Entire cities such as Manchester had not even one representative in the House of Commons, while the 11 voters of Old Sarum retained their ancient right to elect two MPs despite living elsewhere. A small borough was susceptible to bribery, and was often under the control of a patron, whose nominee was guaranteed to win an election. Some aristocrats were patrons of numerous &quot;pocket boroughs&quot;, and therefore controlled a considerable part of the membership of the House of Commons.

When the House of Commons passed a Reform Bill to correct some of these anomalies in 1831, the House of Lords rejected the proposal. The popular cause of reform, however, was not abandoned by the ministry, despite a second rejection of the bill in 1832. Prime Minister Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey advised the King to overwhelm opposition to the bill in the House of Lords by creating about 80 new pro-Reform peers. William IV originally balked at the proposal, which effectively threatened the opposition of the House of Lords, but at length relented.

Before the new peers were created, however, the Lords who opposed the bill admitted defeat and abstained from the vote, allowing the passage of the bill. The crisis damaged the political influence of the House of Lords but did not altogether end it. A vital reform was effected by the Lords themselves in 1868, when they changed their standing orders to abolish proxy voting, preventing Lords from voting without taking the trouble to attend. Over the course of the century the powers of the upper house were further reduced stepwise, culminating in the 20th century with the Parliament Act 1911; the Commons gradually became the stronger House of Parliament.

===20th century===
The status of the House of Lords returned to the forefront of debate after the election of a Liberal Government in 1906. In 1909 the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, introduced into the House of Commons the &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot;, which proposed a land tax targeting wealthy landowners. The popular measure, however, was defeated in the heavily Conservative House of Lords.

Having made the powers of the House of Lords a primary campaign issue, the Liberals were narrowly re-elected in January 1910. The Liberals had lost most of their support in the Lords, which was routinely rejecting Liberals&#x27; bills. Prime Minister H. H. Asquith then proposed that the powers of the House of Lords be severely curtailed. After a further general election in December 1910, and with a reluctant promise by King George V to create sufficient new Liberal peers to overcome the Lords&#x27; opposition to the measure if necessary, the Asquith Government secured the passage of a bill to curtail the powers of the House of Lords. The Parliament Act 1911 effectively abolished the power of the House of Lords to reject legislation, or to amend it in a way unacceptable to the House of Commons; and most bills could be delayed for no more than three parliamentary sessions or two calendar years. It was not meant to be a permanent solution; more comprehensive reforms were planned. Neither party, however, pursued reforms with much enthusiasm, and the House of Lords remained primarily hereditary. The Parliament Act 1949 reduced the delaying power of the House of Lords further to two sessions or one year. In 1958, the predominantly hereditary nature of the House of Lords was changed by the Life Peerages Act 1958, which authorised the creation of life baronies, with no numerical limits. The number of life peers then gradually increased, though not at a constant rate.

The Labour Party had, for most of the 20th century, a commitment, based on the party&#x27;s historic opposition to class privilege, to abolish the House of Lords, or at least expel the hereditary element. In 1968 the Labour Government of Harold Wilson attempted to reform the House of Lords by introducing a system under which hereditary peers would be allowed to remain in the House and take part in debate, but would be unable to vote. This plan, however, was defeated in the House of Commons by a coalition of traditionalist Conservatives (such as Enoch Powell), and Labour members who continued to advocate the outright abolition of the Upper House (such as Michael Foot).

When Foot became leader of the Labour Party in 1980, abolition of the House of Lords became a part of the party&#x27;s agenda; under his successor, Neil Kinnock, however, a reformed Upper House was proposed instead. In the meantime, the creation of new hereditary peerages (except for members of the Royal Family) has been arrested, with the exception of three that were created during the administration of Conservative PM Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.

Whilst some hereditary peers were at best apathetic, the Labour Party&#x27;s clear commitments were not lost on Merlin Hanbury-Tracy, 7th Baron Sudeley, who for decades was considered an expert on the House of Lords. In December 1979 the Conservative Monday Club published his extensive paper entitled &quot;Lords Reform – Why tamper with the House of Lords?&quot; and in July 1980 &quot;The Monarchist&quot; carried another article by Sudeley entitled &quot;Why Reform or Abolish the House of Lords?&quot;. In 1990 he wrote a further booklet for the Monday Club entitled &quot;The Preservation of the House of Lords&quot;.

===21st century===

In 2019, a seven-month enquiry by Naomi Ellenbogen found that one in five staff of the House had experienced bullying or harassment which they did not report for fear of reprisals. This was preceded by several cases, including Liberal Democrat Anthony Lester, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, of Lords using their position to sexually harass or abuse women.

In 2020, the Johnson government considered moving the House of Lords from London to a city in Northern England, likely York, or Birmingham, in the Midlands, in an attempt to &quot;reconnect&quot; the area. It was unclear how the King&#x27;s Speech would be conducted in the event of a move. The idea was received negatively by many peers.

===Lords reform===
With the advent of democratic politics in the United Kingdom, beginning with the Reform Acts from 1832 to 1928, the aristocratic House of Lords was increasingly perceived as an anachronism. Many attempts to reform it have been made, and some have succeeded, most notably the removal of most hereditary peers in 1999. As of 2024, the policy of the Labour Party is to abolish the House of Lords, and to replace it with an elected second chamber, albeit not in the first term of a Labour government.

====First admission of women====

There were no women sitting in the House of Lords until 1958, when a small number came into the chamber as a result of the Life Peerages Act 1958. One of these was Irene Curzon, 2nd Baroness Ravensdale, who had inherited her father&#x27;s peerage in 1925 and was made a life peer to enable her to sit. After a campaign stretching back in some cases to the 1920s, another twelve women who held hereditary peerages in their own right were admitted with the passage of the Peerage Act 1963.

====New Labour era====
The Labour Party included in its 1997 general election manifesto a commitment to remove the hereditary peerage from the House of Lords. Their subsequent election victory in 1997 under Tony Blair led to the denouement of the traditional House of Lords. The Labour government introduced legislation to expel all hereditary peers from the Upper House as a first step in Lords reform. As a part of a compromise, however, it agreed to permit 92 hereditary peers to remain until the reforms were complete. Thus, all but 92 hereditary peers were expelled under the House of Lords Act 1999 (see below for its provisions), making the House of Lords predominantly an appointed house.

Since 1999, however, no further reform has taken place. In 2000, the Wakeham Commission proposed introducing a 20% elected element to the Lords, but this plan was widely criticised. A parliamentary Joint Committee was established in 2001 to resolve the issue, but it reached no conclusion and instead gave Parliament seven options to choose from (fully appointed, 20% elected, 40% elected, 50% elected, 60% elected, 80% elected, and fully elected). In a confusing series of votes in February 2003, all of these options were defeated, although the 80% elected option fell by just three votes in the Commons. Socialist MPs favouring outright abolition voted against all the options.

In 2005, a cross-party group of senior MPs (Kenneth Clarke, Paul Tyler, Tony Wright, George Young, and Robin Cook) published a report proposing that 70% of members of the House of Lords should be elected – each member for a single long term – by the single transferable vote system. Most of the remainder were to be appointed by a Commission to ensure a mix of &quot;skills, knowledge and experience&quot;. This proposal was also not implemented. A cross-party campaign initiative called &quot;Elect the Lords&quot; was set up to make the case for a predominantly elected Upper Chamber in the run up to the 2005 general election.

At the 2005 election, the Labour Party proposed further reform of the Lords, but without specific details. The Conservative Party, which had, prior to 1997, opposed any tampering with the House of Lords, favoured an 80% elected Lords, while the Liberal Democrats called for a fully elected Senate. During 2006, a cross-party committee discussed Lords reform, with the aim of reaching a consensus: its findings were published in early 2007.

On 7 March 2007, members of the House of Commons voted ten times on a variety of alternative compositions for the Upper Chamber. Outright abolition, a wholly appointed, a 20% elected, a 40% elected, a 50% elected, and a 60% elected House of Lords were all defeated in turn. Finally, the vote for an 80% elected Lords was won by 305 votes to 267, and the vote for a wholly elected Lords was won by an even greater margin, 337 to 224. Significantly, this last vote represented an overall majority of MPs.

Furthermore, examination of the names of MPs voting at each division shows that, of the 305 who voted for the 80% elected option, 211 went on to vote for the 100% elected option. Given that this vote took place after the vote on 80% – whose result was already known when the vote on 100% took place – this showed a clear preference for a fully elected Upper House among those who voted for the only other option that passed. But this was nevertheless only an indicative vote, and many political and legislative hurdles remained to be overcome for supporters of an elected House of Lords. Lords, soon after, rejected this proposal and voted for an entirely appointed House of Lords.

In July 2008, Jack Straw, the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, introduced a white paper to the House of Commons proposing to replace the House of Lords with an 80–100% elected chamber, with one third being elected at each general election, to serve a term of approximately 12–15 years. The white paper stated that, as the peerage would be totally separated from membership of the Upper House, the name &quot;House of Lords&quot; would no longer be appropriate. It went on to explain that there was cross-party consensus for the Chamber to be re-titled the &quot;Senate of the United Kingdom&quot;; however, to ensure the debate remained on the role of the Upper House rather than its title, the white paper was neutral on the title issue.

On 30 November 2009, a &quot;Code of Conduct for Members of the House of Lords&quot; was agreed by them. Certain amendments were agreed by them on 30 March 2010 and on 12 June 2014.

The scandal over expenses in the Commons was at its highest pitch only six months before, and the Labourite leadership under Janet Royall, Baroness Royall of Blaisdon determined that something sympathetic should be done.

Meg Russell stated in an article, &quot;Is the House of Lords already reformed?&quot;, three essential features of a legitimate House of Lords: The first was that it must have adequate powers over legislation to make the government think twice before making a decision. The House of Lords, she argued, had enough power to make it relevant. (In his first year, Tony Blair was defeated 38 times in the Lords—but that was before the major reform with the House of Lords Act 1999.) Second, as to the composition of the Lords, Meg Russell suggested that the composition must be distinct from the Commons, otherwise it would render the Lords useless. Third was the perceived legitimacy of the Lords. She stated, &quot;In general legitimacy comes with election.&quot;

====2010–present====

The Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreed, after the 2010 general election, to outline clearly a provision for a wholly or mainly elected second chamber, elected by proportional representation. These proposals sparked a debate on 29 June 2010. As an interim measure, appointment of new peers would reflect the shares of the vote secured by the political parties in the last general election.

Detailed proposals for Lords reform, including a draft House of Lords Reform Bill, were published on 17 May 2011. These included a 300-member hybrid house, of whom 80% would be elected. A further 20% would be appointed, and reserve space would be included for some Church of England archbishops and bishops. Under the proposals, members would also serve single non-renewable terms of 15 years. Former MPs would be allowed to stand for election to the Upper House, but members of the Upper House would not be immediately allowed to become MPs.

The details of the proposal were:
* The upper chamber shall continue to be known as the House of Lords for legislative purposes.
* The reformed House of Lords should have 300 members of whom 240 are &quot;Elected Members&quot; and 60 appointed &quot;Independent Members&quot;. Up to 12 Church of England archbishops and bishops may sit in the house as &quot;ex officio&quot; &quot;Lords Spiritual&quot;.
* Elected Members will serve a single, non-renewable term of 15 years.
* Elections to the reformed Lords should take place at the same time as elections to the House of Commons.
* Elected Members should be elected using the Single Transferable Vote system of proportional representation.
* Twenty Independent Members (a third) shall take their seats within the reformed house at the same time as elected members do so, and for the same 15-year term.
* Independent Members will be appointed by the King after being proposed by the Prime Minister acting on advice of an Appointments Commission.
* There will no longer be a link between the peerage system and membership of the upper house.
* The current powers of the House of Lords would not change and the House of Commons shall retain its status as the primary House of Parliament.

The proposals were considered by a Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform made up of both MPs and Peers, which issued its final report on 23 April 2012, making the following suggestions:
* The reformed House of Lords should have 450 members.
* Party groupings, including the Crossbenchers, should choose which of their members are retained in the transition period, with the percentage of members allotted to each group based on their share of the peers with high attendance during a given period.
* Up to 12 Lords Spiritual should be retained in a reformed House of Lords.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg introduced the House of Lords Reform Bill 2012 on 27 June 2012 which built on proposals published on 17 May 2011. However, this Bill was abandoned by the Government on 6 August 2012, following opposition from within the Conservative Party.

=====House of Lords Reform Act 2014=====
A private member&#x27;s bill to introduce some reforms was introduced by Dan Byles in 2013. The House of Lords Reform Act 2014 received Royal Assent in 2014. Under the new law:

*All peers can retire or resign from the chamber (prior to this only hereditary peers could disclaim their peerages).
*Peers can be disqualified for non-attendance.
*Peers can be removed for receiving prison sentences of a year or more.

=====House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015=====
The House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015 authorised the House to expel or suspend members.

=====Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015=====
This Act made provision to preferentially admit female bishops of the Church of England to the Lords Spiritual over male ones in the 10 years following its commencement (2015 to 2025). This came as a consequence of the Church of England deciding in 2014 to begin to ordain women as bishops.

In 2015, Rachel Treweek, Bishop of Gloucester, became the first woman to sit as a Lord Spiritual in the House of Lords due to the Act. As of 2023, six women bishops sit as Lords Spiritual, five of them having been accelerated due to this Act.

===Size===
The size of the House of Lords has varied greatly throughout its history. The English House of Lords—then comprising 168 members—was joined at Westminster by 16 Scottish peers to represent the peerage of Scotland—a total of 184 nobles—in 1707&#x27;s first Parliament of Great Britain. A further 28 Irish members to represent the peerage of Ireland were added in 1801 to the first Parliament of the United Kingdom. From about 220 peers in the eighteenth century, the house saw continued expansion. From about 850 peers in 1951/52, the numbers rose further with more life peers after the Life Peerages Act 1958 and the inclusion of all Scottish peers and the first female peers in the Peerage Act 1963. It reached a record size of 1,330 in October 1999, immediately before the major Lords reform (House of Lords Act 1999) reduced it to 669, mostly life peers, by March 2000.

The chamber&#x27;s membership again expanded in the following decades, increasing to above eight hundred active members in 2014 and prompting further reforms in the House of Lords Reform Act that year.

In April 2011, a cross-party group of former leading politicians, including many senior members of the House of Lords, called on the Prime Minister David Cameron to stop creating new peers. He had created 117 new peers between entering office in May 2010 and leaving in July 2016, a faster rate of elevation than any PM in British history; at the same time his government had tried (in vain) to reduce the House of Commons by 50, from 650 to 600 MPs.

In August 2014, despite there being a seating capacity for only around 230 to 400 on the benches in the Lords chamber, the House had 774 active members (plus 54 who were not entitled to attend or vote, having been suspended or granted leave of absence). This made the House of Lords the largest parliamentary chamber in any democracy. In August 2014, former Speaker of the House of Commons Betty Boothroyd requested that &quot;older peers should retire gracefully&quot; to ease the overcrowding in the House of Lords. She also criticised successive prime ministers for filling the second chamber with &quot;lobby fodder&quot; in an attempt to help their policies become law. She made her remarks days before a new batch of peers were due to be created and several months after the passage of the House of Lords Reform Act 2014, enabling life peers to retire or resign their seats in the House, which had previously only been possible for hereditary peers and bishops.

In August 2015, when 45 more peers were created in the Dissolution Honours, the total number of eligible members of the Lords increased to 826. In a report entitled &quot;Does size matter?&quot; the BBC said: &quot;Increasingly, yes. Critics argue the House of Lords is the second largest legislature after the Chinese National People&#x27;s Congress and dwarfs upper houses in other bicameral democracies such as the United States (100 senators), France (348 senators), Australia (76 senators), Canada (105 appointed senators) and India (250 members). The Lords is also larger than the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly of North Korea (687 members)&quot;, and that &quot;Peers grumble that there is not enough room to accommodate all of their colleagues in the Chamber, where there are only about 400 seats, and say they are constantly jostling for space – particularly during high-profile sittings&quot;, but added, &quot;On the other hand, defenders of the Lords say that it does a vital job scrutinising legislation, a lot of which has come its way from the Commons in recent years&quot;.

In late 2016, a Lord Speaker&#x27;s committee was formed to examine the issue of overcrowding, with fears membership could swell to above 1,000, and in October 2017 the committee presented its findings. In December 2017, the Lords debated and broadly approved its report, which proposed a cap on membership at 600 peers, with a fifteen-year term limit for new peers and a &quot;two-out, one-in&quot; limit on new appointments. By October 2018, the Lord Speaker&#x27;s committee commended the reduction in peers&#x27; numbers, noting that the rate of departures had been greater than expected, with the House of Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Select Committee approving the progress achieved without legislation.

By April 2019, with the retirement of nearly one hundred peers since the passage of the House of Lords Reform Act 2014, the number of active peers had been reduced to a total of 782, of whom 665 were life peers. This total, however, remains greater than the membership of 669 peers in March 2000, after implementation of the House of Lords Act 1999 removed the bulk of the hereditary peers from their seats; it is well above the proposed 600-member cap, and is still larger than the House of Commons&#x27;s 650 members.

== Functions ==
===Legislative functions===

All legislation, with the exception of money bills, may be introduced in either the House of Lords or House of Commons.

The House of Lords debates legislation, and has the power to amend or reject bills. However, the power of the Lords to reject a bill passed by the House of Commons is severely restricted by the Parliament Acts. Under those Acts, certain types of bills may be presented for Royal Assent without the consent of the House of Lords (i.e. the Commons can override the Lords&#x27; veto). The House of Lords cannot delay a money bill (a bill that, in the view of the Speaker of the House of Commons, solely concerns national taxation or public funds) for more than one month.

Other public bills cannot be delayed by the House of Lords for more than two parliamentary sessions, or one calendar year. These provisions, however, only apply to public bills that originate in the House of Commons, and cannot have the effect of extending a parliamentary term beyond five years. A further restriction is a constitutional convention known as the Salisbury Convention, which means that the House of Lords does not oppose legislation promised in the Government&#x27;s election manifesto.

By a custom that prevailed even before the Parliament Acts, the House of Lords is further restrained insofar as financial bills are concerned. The House of Lords may neither originate a bill concerning taxation or Supply (supply of treasury or exchequer funds), nor amend a bill so as to insert a taxation or Supply-related provision. (The House of Commons, however, often waives its privileges and allows the Upper House to make amendments with financial implications.) Moreover, the Upper House may not amend any Supply Bill. The House of Lords formerly maintained the absolute power to reject a bill relating to revenue or Supply, but this power was curtailed by the Parliament Acts.

===Relationship with the government===
The House of Lords does not control the term of the prime minister or of the government. Only the lower house may force the prime minister to resign or call elections by passing a motion of no-confidence or by withdrawing supply. Therefore, the House of Lords&#x27; oversight of the government is limited.

Most Cabinet ministers are from the House of Commons rather than the House of Lords. In particular, all prime ministers since 1902 have been members of the lower house (Alec Douglas-Home, who became prime minister in 1963 whilst still an earl, disclaimed his peerage and was elected to the Commons soon after his term began). In recent history, it has been very rare for major cabinet positions (except Lord Chancellor and Leader of the House of Lords) to have been filled by peers.

Exceptions include:
*Lord Carrington, who was the Secretary of State for Defence from 1970 to 1974, Secretary of State for Energy briefly for two months in early 1974 and Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs between 1979 and 1982
*Lord Cockfield, who served as Secretary of State for Trade and President of the Board of Trade
*Lord Young of Graffham, who was Minister without Portfolio, then Secretary of State for Employment and then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and President of the Board of Trade from 1984 to 1989
*Baroness Amos, who served as Secretary of State for International Development
*Lord Adonis, who served as Secretary of State for Transport
*Lord Mandelson, who served as First Secretary of State, Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills and President of the Board of Trade
*George Robertson was briefly a peer whilst serving as Secretary of State for Defence before resigning to take up the post of Secretary General of NATO.
*Baroness Morgan of Cotes was appointed as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport as an MP, but retained the office when she was appointed to the House of Lords.
*David Cameron, Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton and a former Prime Minister, was appointed Foreign Secretary and a member of the House of Lords in 2023.

From 1999 to 2010 the Attorney General for England and Wales was a member of the House of Lords; , the Attorney General is once again a peer.

The House of Lords remains a source for junior ministers and members of government. Like the House of Commons, the Lords also has a Government Chief Whip as well as several Junior Whips. Where a government department is not represented by a minister in the Lords or one is not available, government whips will act as spokesmen for them.

===Former judicial role===

Historically, the House of Lords held several judicial functions. Most notably, until 2009 the House of Lords served as the court of last resort for most instances of UK law. Since 1 October 2009 this role is now held by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.

The Lords&#x27; judicial functions originated from the ancient role of the Curia Regis as a body that addressed the petitions of the King&#x27;s subjects. The functions were exercised not by the whole House, but by a committee of &quot;Law Lords&quot;. The bulk of the House&#x27;s judicial business was conducted by the twelve Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, who were specifically appointed for this purpose under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876.

The judicial functions could also be exercised by Lords of Appeal (other members of the House who happened to have held high judicial office). No Lord of Appeal in Ordinary or Lord of Appeal could sit judicially beyond the age of seventy-five. The judicial business of the Lords was supervised by the Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and their deputy, the Second Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary.

The jurisdiction of the House of Lords extended, in civil and in criminal cases, to appeals from the courts of England and Wales, and of Northern Ireland. From Scotland, appeals were possible only in civil cases; Scotland&#x27;s High Court of Justiciary is the highest court in criminal matters. The House of Lords was not the United Kingdom&#x27;s only court of last resort; in some cases, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council performs such a function. The jurisdiction of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom, however, is relatively restricted; it encompasses appeals from ecclesiastical courts, disputes under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975, and a few other minor matters. Issues related to devolution were transferred from the Privy Council to the Supreme Court in 2009.

The twelve Law Lords did not all hear every case; rather, after World War II cases were heard by panels known as Appellate Committees, each of which normally consisted of five members (selected by the Senior Lord). An Appellate Committee hearing an important case could consist of more than five members. Though Appellate Committees met in separate committee rooms, judgement was given in the Lords Chamber itself. No further appeal lay from the House of Lords, although the House of Lords could refer a &quot;preliminary question&quot; to the European Court of Justice in cases involving an element of European Union law, and a case could be brought at the European Court of Human Rights if the House of Lords did not provide a satisfactory remedy in cases where the European Convention on Human Rights was relevant.

A distinct judicial function—one in which the whole House used to participate—is that of trying impeachments. Impeachments were brought by the House of Commons, and tried in the House of Lords; a conviction required only a majority of the Lords voting. Impeachments, however, are to all intents and purposes obsolete; the last impeachment was that of Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, in 1806.

Similarly, the House of Lords was once the court that tried peers charged with high treason or felony. The House would be presided over not by the Lord Chancellor, but by the Lord High Steward, an official especially appointed for the occasion of the trial. If Parliament was not in session, then peers could be tried in a separate court, known as the Lord High Steward&#x27;s Court. Only peers, their wives, and their widows (unless remarried) were entitled to such trials; the Lords Spiritual were tried in ecclesiastical courts. In 1948, the right of peers to be tried in such special courts was abolished; now, they are tried in the regular courts. The last such trial in the House was of Edward Russell, 26th Baron de Clifford, in 1935. An illustrative dramatisation circa 1928 of a trial of a peer (the fictional Duke of Denver) on a charge of murder (a felony) is portrayed in the 1972 BBC Television adaption of Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27; Lord Peter Wimsey mystery &quot;Clouds of Witness&quot;.

The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 resulted in the creation of a separate Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, to which the judicial function of the House of Lords, and some of the judicial functions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, were transferred. In addition, the office of Lord Chancellor was reformed by the act, removing his ability to act as both a government minister and a judge. This was motivated in part by concerns about the historical admixture of legislative, judicial, and executive power. The new Supreme Court is located at Middlesex Guildhall.

==Membership==
===Lords Spiritual===
Members of the House of Lords who sit by virtue of their ecclesiastical offices are known as Lords Spiritual. Formerly, the Lords Spiritual were the majority in the English House of Lords, comprising the church&#x27;s archbishops, (diocesan) bishops, abbots, and those priors who were entitled to wear a mitre. After the English Reformation&#x27;s high point in 1539, only the archbishops and bishops continued to attend, as the Dissolution of the Monasteries had just disposed of and suppressed the positions of abbot and prior. In 1642, during the few gatherings of the Lords convened during English Interregnum which saw periodic war, the Lords Spiritual were excluded altogether, but they returned under the Clergy Act 1661.

The number of Lords Spiritual was further restricted by the Bishopric of Manchester Act 1847, and by later Acts. The Lords Spiritual can now number no more than 26: these are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester (who sit by right regardless of seniority), and the 21 longest-serving archbishops and bishops from other dioceses in the Church of England (excluding the dioceses of Sodor and Man and Gibraltar in Europe, as these lie entirely outside the United Kingdom). Following a change to the law in 2014 to allow women to be ordained archbishops and bishops, the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015 was passed, which provides that whenever a vacancy arises among the Lords Spiritual during the ten years following the Act coming into force, the vacancy has to be filled by a woman, if one is eligible. This does not apply to the five archbishops and bishops who sit by right.

The current Lords Spiritual represent only the Church of England. Archbishops and bishops of the Church of Scotland historically sat in the Parliament of Scotland but were finally excluded in 1689 (after a number of previous exclusions) when the Church of Scotland became permanently Presbyterian. There are no longer archbishops and bishops in the Church of Scotland in the traditional sense of the word, and that Church has never sent members to sit in the Westminster House of Lords. The Church of Ireland did obtain representation in the House of Lords after the union of Ireland and Great Britain in 1801. Of the Church of Ireland&#x27;s ecclesiastics, four (one archbishop and three bishops) were to sit at any one time, with the members rotating at the end of every parliamentary session (which normally lasted about one year). The Church of Ireland, however, was disestablished in 1871, and thereafter ceased to be represented by Lords Spiritual. Archbishops and bishops of Welsh sees in the Church of England originally sat in the House of Lords (after 1847, only if their seniority within the church entitled them to), but the Church in Wales ceased to be a part of the Church of England in 1920 and was simultaneously disestablished in Wales. Accordingly, archbishops and bishops of the Church in Wales were no longer eligible to be appointed to the House as archbishops and bishops of the Church of England, but those already appointed remained.

Other ecclesiastics have sat in the House of Lords as Lords Temporal in recent times: Immanuel Jakobovits, Chief Rabbi of the United Synagogue (the largest organisation of Orthodox Jewish congregations in Britain) was appointed to the House of Lords (with the consent of Queen Elizabeth II, who acted on the advice of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher), as was his successor Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks. Julia Neuberger is the senior rabbi to the West London Synagogue. In recognition of his work at reconciliation and in the peace process in Northern Ireland, the Archbishop of Armagh (the senior Anglican archbishop in Ireland), Robin Eames, was appointed to the Lords by John Major. Other clergy appointed include Donald Soper, Timothy Beaumont, and some Scottish clerics.

There have been no Roman Catholic clergy appointed, though it was rumoured that Cardinal Basil Hume and his successor Cardinal Cormac Murphy O&#x27;Connor were offered peerages by James Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair respectively, but declined. Cardinal Hume later accepted the Order of Merit, a personal appointment of Queen Elizabeth II, shortly before his death. Cardinal Murphy O&#x27;Connor for his part said he had his maiden speech ready, but ultimately did not accept a peerage. Future appointments of Catholic clergy to the Lords is unlikely, as since the promulgation of the 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;, all Catholic clergy of the Latin Church have been discouraged from holding secular public office, and all diocesan priests and bishops have been completely prohibited from it (excepting only political offices of the Vatican City State).

Former Archbishops of Canterbury, having reverted to the status of a regular bishop but no longer diocesans, are invariably given life peerages and sit as Lords Temporal.

By custom at least one of the archbishops or bishops reads prayers in each legislative day (a role taken by the chaplain in the Commons). They often speak in debates; in 2004 Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, opened a debate into sentencing legislation. Measures (proposed laws of the Church of England) must be put before the Lords, and the Lords Spiritual have a role in ensuring that this takes place.

===Lords Temporal===
====Hereditary peers====
Since the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the Lords Temporal have been the most numerous group in the House of Lords. Unlike the Lords Spiritual, they may be publicly partisan, aligning themselves with one or another of the political parties that dominate the House of Commons. Publicly non-partisan Lords are called crossbenchers. Originally, the Lords Temporal included several hundred hereditary peers (that is, those whose peerages may be inherited), who ranked variously as dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts, and barons (as well as Scottish Lords of Parliament). Such hereditary dignities can be created by the Crown; in modern times this is done on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day (except in the case of members of the Royal Family).

Holders of Scottish and Irish peerages were not always permitted to sit in the Lords. When Scotland united with England to form Great Britain in 1707, it was provided that the Scottish hereditary peers would only be able to elect 16 Scottish representative peers to sit in the House of Lords; the term of a representative was to extend until the next general election. A similar provision was enacted when Ireland merged with Great Britain in 1801 to form the United Kingdom; the Irish peers were allowed to elect 28 Irish representative peers, who were to retain office for life. Elections for Irish representatives ended in 1922, when most of Ireland became an independent state known as the Irish Free State; elections for Scottish representatives ended with the passage of the Peerage Act 1963, under which all Scottish peers obtained seats in the Upper House.

In 1999, the Labour government brought forward the House of Lords Act removing the right of several hundred hereditary peers to sit in the House. The Act provided, as a measure intended to be temporary, that 92 people would continue to sit in the Lords by virtue of hereditary peerages, and this is still in effect.

Of the 92, two remain in the House of Lords because they hold royal offices connected with Parliament: the Earl Marshal and the Lord Great Chamberlain. Of the remaining ninety peers sitting in the Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage, 15 are elected by the whole House and 75 are chosen by fellow hereditary peers in the House of Lords, grouped by party. (A holder of a hereditary peerage who is given a life peerage becomes a member of the House of Lords without a need for a by-election.) The exclusion of other hereditary peers removed Charles, then Prince of Wales (who was also Earl of Chester) and all other royal peers, including Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; Prince Edward, then Earl of Wessex; Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester; and Prince Edward, Duke of Kent.

The number of hereditary peers to be chosen by a political group reflects the proportion of hereditary peers that belonged to that group (see current composition below) in 1999. When an elected hereditary peer dies, a by-election is held, with a variant of the Alternative Vote system being used. If the recently deceased hereditary peer had been elected by the whole House, then so are their replacement; a hereditary peer elected by a specific political group (including the non-aligned crossbenchers) is replaced by a vote of the hereditary peers already elected to the Lords belonging to that political group (whether elected by that group or by the whole house).

====Lords of Appeal in Ordinary====
Until 2009, the Lords Temporal also included the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, more commonly known as Law Lords, a group of individuals appointed to the House of Lords so that they could exercise its judicial functions. Lords of Appeal in Ordinary were first appointed under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876. They were selected by the Prime Minister of the day, but were formally appointed by the Sovereign. A Lord of Appeal in Ordinary had to retire at the age of 70, or, if his term was extended by the government, at the age of 75; after reaching such an age, the Law Lord could not hear any further cases in the House of Lords.

The number of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (excluding those who were no longer able to hear cases because of age restrictions) was limited to twelve, but could be changed by statutory instrument. By a convention of the House, Lords of Appeal in Ordinary did not take part in debates on new legislation, so as to maintain judicial independence. Lords of Appeal in Ordinary held their seats in the House of Lords for life, remaining as members even after reaching the judicial retirement age of 70 or 75. Former Lord Chancellors and holders of other high judicial office could also sit as Law Lords under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, although in practice this right was only rarely exercised.

Under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary when the Act came into effect in 2009 became judges of the new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and were then barred from sitting or voting in the House of Lords until they had retired as judges. One of the main justifications for the new Supreme Court was to establish a separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature. It is therefore unlikely that future appointees to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom will be made Lords of Appeal in Ordinary.

====Life peers====
The largest group of Lords Temporal, and indeed of the whole House, are life peers. there are 670 life peers eligible to vote in the House. Life peers rank only as barons or baronesses, and are created under the Life Peerages Act 1958. Like all other peers, life peers are created by the Sovereign, who acts on the advice of the Prime Minister or the House of Lords Appointments Commission. By convention, however, the Prime Minister allows leaders of other parties to nominate some life peers, so as to maintain a political balance in the House of Lords. Moreover, some non-party life peers (the number being determined by the Prime Minister) are nominated by the independent House of Lords Appointments Commission.

In 2000 the government announced that it would set up an Independent Appointments Commission, under Dennis Stevenson, Lord Stevenson of Coddenham, to select fifteen so-called &quot;people&#x27;s peers&quot; for life peerages. However, when the choices were announced in April 2001, from a list of 3,000 applicants, the choices were treated with criticism in the media, as all were distinguished in their field, and none were &quot;ordinary people&quot; as some had originally hoped.

===Qualifications===

Several different qualifications apply for membership of the House of Lords. No person may sit in the House of Lords if under the age of 21. Furthermore, only United Kingdom, Irish and Commonwealth citizens may sit in the House of Lords. The nationality restrictions were previously more stringent: under the Act of Settlement 1701, and prior to the British Nationality Act 1948, only natural-born subjects qualified.

Additionally, some bankruptcy-related restrictions apply to members of the Upper House. Subjects of a Bankruptcy Restrictions Order (applicable in England and Wales only), adjudged bankrupt (in Northern Ireland), or a sequestered estate (in Scotland) are not eligible to sit in the House of Lords. Individuals convicted of high treason are prohibited from sitting in the House of Lords until completion of their full term of imprisonment. An exception applies, however, if the individual convicted of high treason receives a full pardon. An individual serving a prison sentence for an offence other than high treason is &quot;not&quot; automatically disqualified.

Women were excluded from the House of Lords until the Life Peerages Act 1958, passed to address the declining number of active members, made possible the creation of peerages for life. Women were immediately eligible and four were among the first life peers appointed. However, female hereditary peers continued to be excluded until the passage of the Peerage Act 1963. Since the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999, female hereditary peers remain eligible for election to the Upper House; until her resignation on 1 May 2020, there was one (Margaret of Mar, 31st Countess of Mar) among the 90 hereditary peers who continue to sit. After Barbara Wootton became one of the first four life peers appointed under the Life Peerages Act 1958, she requested that she not be referred to as &quot;peeress&quot;, believing that the term failed to distinguish female peers from the mere wives of peers.

====Cash for peerages====
The Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925 made it illegal for a peerage, or other honour, to be bought or sold. Nonetheless, there have been repeated allegations that life peerages (and thus membership of the House of Lords) have been made available to major political donors in exchange for donations. The most prominent example, the Cash for Honours scandal in 2006, saw a police investigation, with no charges being brought. A 2015 study found that of 303 people nominated for peerages in the period 2005–2014, a total of 211 were former senior figures within politics (including former MPs), or were non-political appointments. Of the remaining 92 political appointments from outside public life, 27 had made significant donations to political parties. The authors concluded firstly that nominees from outside public life were much more likely to have made large gifts than peers nominated after prior political or public service. They also found that significant donors to parties were far more likely to be nominated for peerages than other party members.

===Removal from House membership===
Traditionally there was no mechanism by which members could resign or be removed from the House of Lords (compare the situation as regards resignation from the House of Commons). The Peerage Act 1963 permitted a person to disclaim their newly inherited peerage (within certain time limits); this meant that such a person could effectively renounce their membership of the Lords. This might be done in order to remain or become qualified to sit in the House of Commons, as in the case of Tony Benn (formerly the second Viscount Stansgate), who had campaigned for such a change.

The House of Lords Reform Act 2014 made provision for members&#x27; resignation from the House, removal for non-attendance, and automatic expulsion upon conviction for a serious criminal offence (if resulting in a jail sentence of at least one year). In June 2015, under the House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015, the House&#x27;s Standing Orders may provide for the expulsion or suspension of a member upon a resolution of the House.

In November 2020, Nazir Ahmed, Lord Ahmed retired from the House of Lords, having seen a Lords Conduct Committee report recommending he be expelled. In December the same year, Lord Maginnis was suspended from the House for 18 months.

==Officers==
Traditionally the House of Lords did not elect its own speaker, unlike the House of Commons; rather, the &quot;ex officio&quot; presiding officer was the Lord Chancellor. With the passage of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the post of Lord Speaker was created, a position to which a peer is elected by the House and subsequently appointed by the Crown. The first Lord Speaker, elected on 4 May 2006, was Helene Hayman, Baroness Hayman, a former Labour peer. As the Speaker is expected to be an impartial presiding officer, Hayman resigned from the Labour Party. In 2011, Frances D&#x27;Souza, Baroness D&#x27;Souza was elected as the second Lord Speaker, replacing Hayman in September 2011. D&#x27;Souza was in turn succeeded by Norman Fowler, Lord Fowler in September 2016, who served as Lord Speaker until his resignation in April 2021. He was succeeded as Lord Speaker by John McFall, Lord McFall of Alcluith, who is the incumbent Lord Speaker.

This reform of the post of Lord Chancellor was made due to the perceived constitutional anomalies inherent in the role. The Lord Chancellor was not only the Speaker of the House of Lords, but also a member of the Cabinet; his or her department, formerly the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department, is now called the Ministry of Justice. The Lord Chancellor is no longer the head of the judiciary of England and Wales. Hitherto, the Lord Chancellor was part of all three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial.

The overlap of the legislative and executive roles is a characteristic of the Westminster system, as the entire cabinet consists of members of the House of Commons or the House of Lords; however, in June 2003, the Blair Government announced its intention to abolish the post of Lord Chancellor because of the office&#x27;s mixed executive and judicial responsibilities. The abolition of the office was rejected by the House of Lords, and the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 was thus amended to preserve the office of Lord Chancellor. The Act no longer guarantees that the office holder of Lord Chancellor is the presiding officer of the House of Lords, and therefore allows the House of Lords to elect a speaker of their own.
The lord speaker may be replaced as presiding officer by one of his or her deputies. The chairman of committees, the principal deputy chairman of committees, and several chairmen are all deputies to the lord speaker, and are all appointed by the House of Lords itself at the beginning of each session. By custom, the Crown appoints each chairman, principal deputy chairman and deputy chairman to the additional office of Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords. There was previously no legal requirement that the lord chancellor or a deputy speaker be a member of the House of Lords (though the same has long been customary).

Whilst presiding over the House of Lords, the lord chancellor traditionally wore ceremonial black and gold robes. Robes of black and gold are now worn by the lord chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice in the House of Commons, on ceremonial occasions. This is no longer a requirement for the lord speaker except for state occasions outside of the chamber. The speaker or deputy speaker sits on the Woolsack, a large red seat stuffed with wool, at the front of the Lords Chamber.

When the House of Lords resolves itself into committee (see below), the Chairman of Committees or a Deputy Chairman of Committees presides, not from the Woolsack, but from a chair at the Table of the House. The presiding officer has little power compared to the Speaker of the House of Commons. The presiding officer only acts as the mouthpiece of the House, performing duties such as announcing the results of votes. This is because, unlike in the House of Commons where all statements are directed to &quot;Mr/Madam Speaker&quot;, in the House of Lords they are directed to &quot;My Lords&quot;; i.e., the entire body of the House.

The Lord Speaker or Deputy Speaker cannot determine which members may speak, or discipline members for violating the rules of the House; these measures may be taken only by the House itself. Unlike the politically neutral Speaker of the House of Commons, the Lord Chancellor and Deputy Speakers originally remained members of their respective parties, and were permitted to participate in debate; however, this is no longer true of the new role of Lord Speaker.

Another officer of the body is the Leader of the House of Lords, a peer selected by the Prime Minister. The Leader of the House is responsible for steering Government bills through the House of Lords, and is a member of the Cabinet. The Leader also advises the House on proper procedure when necessary, but such advice is merely informal, rather than official and binding. A Deputy Leader is also appointed by the Prime Minister, and takes the place of an absent or unavailable leader.

The Clerk of the Parliaments is the chief clerk and officer of the House of Lords (but is not a member of the House itself). The Clerk, who is appointed by the Crown, advises the presiding officer on the rules of the House, signs orders and official communications, endorses bills, and is the keeper of the official records of both Houses of Parliament. Moreover, the Clerk of the Parliaments is responsible for arranging by-elections of hereditary peers when necessary. The deputies of the Clerk of the Parliaments (the Clerk Assistant and the Reading Clerk) are appointed by the Lord Speaker, subject to the House&#x27;s approval.

The Gentleman or Lady Usher of the Black Rod is also an officer of the House; they take their title from the symbol of their office, a black rod. Black Rod (as the Gentleman/Lady Usher is normally known) is responsible for ceremonial arrangements, is in charge of the House&#x27;s doorkeepers, and may (upon the order of the House) take action to end disorder or disturbance in the Chamber. Black Rod also holds the office of Serjeant-at-Arms of the House of Lords, and in this capacity attends upon the Lord Speaker. The Gentleman or Lady Usher of the Black Rod&#x27;s duties may be delegated to the Yeoman Usher of the Black Rod or to the Assistant Serjeant-at-Arms.

==Procedure==


The House of Lords and the House of Commons assemble in the Palace of Westminster. The Lords Chamber is lavishly decorated, in contrast with the more modestly furnished Commons Chamber. Benches in the Lords Chamber are coloured red. The Woolsack is at the front of the Chamber; the Government sit on benches on the right of the Woolsack, while members of the Opposition sit on the left. Crossbenchers sit on the benches immediately opposite the Woolsack.

The Lords Chamber is the site of many formal ceremonies, the most famous of which is the State Opening of Parliament, held at the beginning of each new parliamentary session. During the State Opening, the Sovereign, seated on the Throne in the Lords Chamber and in the presence of both Houses of Parliament, delivers a speech outlining the Government&#x27;s agenda for the upcoming parliamentary session.

In the House of Lords, members need not seek the recognition of the presiding officer before speaking, as is done in the House of Commons. If two or more Lords simultaneously rise to speak, the House decides which one is to be heard by acclamation, or, if necessary, by voting on a motion. Often, however, the Leader of the House will suggest an order, which is thereafter generally followed. Speeches in the House of Lords are addressed to the House as a whole (&quot;My Lords&quot;) rather than to the presiding officer alone (as is the custom in the Lower House). Members may not refer to each other in the second person (as &quot;you&quot;), but rather use third person forms such as &quot;the noble Duke&quot;, &quot;the noble Earl&quot;, &quot;the noble Lord&quot;, &quot;my noble friend&quot;, &quot;The most Reverend Primate&quot;, etc.

Each member may make no more than one speech on a motion, except that the mover of the motion may make one speech at the beginning of the debate and another at the end. Speeches are not subject to any time limits in the House; however, the House may put an end to a speech by approving a motion &quot;that the noble Lord be no longer heard&quot;. It is also possible for the House to end the debate entirely, by approving a motion &quot;that the Question be now put&quot;. This procedure is known as Closure, and is extremely rare. Six closure motions were passed on 4 April 2019 to significant media attention as part of consideration of a private member&#x27;s bill concerning the United Kingdom&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union.

Once all speeches on a motion have concluded, or Closure invoked, the motion may be put to a vote. The House first votes by voice vote; the Lord Speaker or Deputy Speaker puts the question, and the Lords respond either &quot;content&quot; (in favour of the motion) or &quot;not content&quot; (against the motion). The presiding officer then announces the result of the voice vote, but if his assessment is challenged by any Lord, a recorded vote known as a division follows.

Members of the House enter one of two lobbies (the &quot;content&quot; lobby or the &quot;not-content&quot; lobby) on either side of the Chamber, where their names are recorded by clerks. At each lobby are two Tellers (themselves members of the House) who count the votes of the Lords. The Lord Speaker may not take part in the vote. Once the division concludes, the Tellers provide the results thereof to the presiding officer, who then announces them to the House.

If there is an equality of votes, the motion is decided according to the following principles: legislation may proceed in its present form, unless there is a majority in favour of amending or rejecting it; any other motions are rejected, unless there is a majority in favour of approving it. The quorum of the House of Lords is just three members for a general or procedural vote, and 30 members for a vote on legislation. If fewer than three or 30 members (as appropriate) are present, the division is invalid.

Special arrangements were made during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic to allow some duties to be carried out online.

===Disciplinary powers===
By contrast with the House of Commons, the House of Lords has not until recently had an established procedure for imposing sanctions on its members. When a cash for influence scandal was referred to the Committee of Privileges in January 2009, the Leader of the House of Lords also asked the Privileges Committee to report on what sanctions the House had against its members. After seeking advice from the Attorney General for England and Wales and the former Lord Chancellor James Mackay, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the committee decided that the House &quot;possessed an inherent power&quot; to suspend errant members, although not to withhold a writ of summons nor to expel a member permanently. When the House subsequently suspended Peter Truscott, Lord Truscott and Tom Taylor, Lord Taylor of Blackburn for their role in the scandal, they were the first to meet this fate since 1642.

Recent changes have expanded the disciplinary powers of the House. Section 3 of the House of Lords Reform Act 2014 now provides that any member of the House of Lords convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for more than one year loses their seat. The House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015 allows the House to set up procedures to suspend, and to expel, its members.

====Regulation of behaviour in the chamber====
There are two motions which have grown up through custom and practice and which govern questionable conduct within the House. They are brought into play by a member standing up, possibly intervening on another member, and moving the motion without notice. When the debate is getting excessively heated, it is open to a member to move &quot;that the Standing Order on Asperity of Speech be read by the Clerk&quot;. The motion can be debated, but if agreed by the House, the Clerk of the Parliaments will read Standing Order 32 which provides &quot;That all personal, sharp, or taxing speeches be forborn&quot;. The Journals of the House of Lords record only four instances on which the House has ordered the Standing Order to be read since the procedure was invented in 1871.

For more serious problems with an individual Lord, the option is available to move &quot;That the noble Lord be no longer heard&quot;. This motion also is debatable, and the debate which ensues has sometimes offered a chance for the member whose conduct has brought it about to come to order so that the motion can be withdrawn. If the motion is passed, its effect is to prevent the member from continuing their speech on the motion then under debate. The Journals identify eleven occasions on which this motion has been moved since 1884; four were eventually withdrawn, one was voted down, and six were passed.

===Leave of absence===
In 1958, to counter criticism that some peers only appeared at major decisions in the House and thereby particular votes were swayed, the Standing Orders of the House of Lords were enhanced. Peers who did not wish to attend meetings regularly or were prevented by ill health, age or further reasons, were now able to request leave of absence. During the granted time a peer is expected not to visit the House&#x27;s meetings until either its expiration or termination, announced at least a month prior to their return.

===Attendance allowance===
Via a new financial support system introduced in 2010, members of the House of Lords can opt to receive an attendance allowance per sitting day of currently £342 (as of 2023; initially it was £300 in 2010), plus limited travel expenses. Peers can choose to receive a reduced attendance allowance of £171 per day instead, or none at all. 
Prior to 2010, peers from outside London could claim an overnight allowance of £174.

==Committees==
Unlike in the House of Commons, when the term committee is used to describe a stage of a bill, this committee does not take the form of a public bill committee, but what is described as Committee of the Whole House. It is made up of all members of the House of Lords, where any member is allowed to contribute to debates and provides for flexible rules of procedure. It is presided over by the Chairman of Committees.

The term committee is also used to describe Grand Committee, where the same rules of procedure apply as in the main chamber, except that no divisions may take place. For this reason, business that is discussed in Grand Committee is usually uncontroversial and likely to be agreed unanimously.

Public bills may also be committed to pre-legislative committees. A pre-legislative Committee is specifically constituted for a particular bill. These committees are established in advance of the bill being laid before either the House of Lords or the House of Commons and can take evidence from the public. Such committees are rare and do not replace any of the usual stages of a bill, including committee stage.

The House of Lords also has 15 Select committees. Typically, these are &quot;sessional committees&quot;, meaning that their members are appointed by the House at the beginning of each session, and continue to serve until the next parliamentary session begins. In practice, these are often permanent committees, which are re-established during every session. These committees are typically empowered to make reports to the House &quot;from time to time&quot;, that is, whenever they wish. Other committees are &quot;ad-hoc committees&quot;, which are set up to investigate a specific issue. When they are set up by a motion in the House, the motion will set a deadline by which the Committee must report. After this date, the committee will cease to exist unless it is granted an extension. One example of this is the Committee on Public Service and Demographic Change. The House of Lords may appoint a chairman for a committee; if it does not do so, the Chairman of Committees or a Deputy Chairman of Committees may preside instead. Most of the Select Committees are also granted the power to co-opt members, such as the European Union Committee. The primary function of Select Committees is to scrutinise and investigate Government activities; to fulfil these aims, they are permitted to hold hearings and collect evidence. Bills may be referred to Select Committees, but are more often sent to the Committee of the Whole House and Grand Committees.

The committee system of the House of Lords also includes several Domestic Committees, which supervise or consider the House&#x27;s procedures and administration. One of the Domestic Committees is the Committee of Selection, which is responsible for assigning members to many of the House&#x27;s other committees.

==Current composition==
There are currently sitting members of the House of Lords, of which 667 are life peers (as of 2 October 2023) and 228 are women (see:Women in the House of Lords). An additional Lords are ineligible to participate, including two peers who are constitutionally disqualified as members of the Judiciary.

The House of Lords Act 1999 allocated 75 of the 92 hereditary peers to the parties based on the proportion of hereditary peers that belonged to that party in 1999:
* Conservative Party: 42 peers
* Labour Party: 2 peers
* Liberal Democrats: 3 peers
* Crossbenchers: 28 peers

Of the initial 42 hereditary peers elected as Conservatives, one, David Verney, 21st Lord Willoughby de Broke, defected to UKIP, though he left the party in 2018.

Fifteen hereditary peers are elected by the whole House, and the remaining hereditary peers are the two royal office-holders, the Earl Marshal and the Lord Great Chamberlain.

A report in 2007 stated that many members of the Lords (particularly the life peers) do not attend regularly; the average daily attendance was around 408.

While the number of hereditary peers is limited to 92, and that of Lords spiritual to 26, there is no maximum limit to the number of life peers who may be members of the House of Lords at any time.

=== Gender imbalance ===
Although female representation in the Lords has risen each decade since 1960, the pace has slowed in recent years, with the number of women peers rising 1% since 2020. A report by the Unlock Democracy think tank found that if every woman ever made a peer was still alive and sitting in the House of Lords today, men would still outnumber women by nearly two to one. The report singled out Rishi Sunak&#x27;s female appointment rates to the House of Lords, at 17% of his party&#x27;s appointments as compared with 37.5% of Tory peers appointed under Truss, 20.9% by appointed under Johnson, 46.2% under May, and 30% under Cameron; the report also states that appointment rates under Labour were scarcely higher.

==Criticisms==

There are several criticisms of the House of Lords, including:

* The appointments process, which has often been described as undemocratic. The current process means the House of Lords remains fully unelected and allows peers to hold their seats until death.
* The makeup of the Lords does not reflect the social and demographic diversity of the UK, with under-representation of ethnic minorities and women when compared with the House of Commons, and relative over-representation of people from South East England and people over 50.
* The House of Lords is often criticised for being too large, and thus too expensive. With almost 800 members it is the second-largest legislative house in the world, second only to the National People&#x27;s Congress of China, and is much larger than Upper Houses in comparable countries. The physical capacity of the chamber is only about 400 seats, which has led to &quot;jostling for space&quot;.

These criticisms have led some to question whether there is a need for a second house at all, and whether the bicameral system in British politics is still useful.

<text>In mathematics and more specifically in topology, a homeomorphism (from Greek roots meaning &quot;similar shape&quot;, named by Henri Poincaré), also called topological isomorphism, or bicontinuous function, is a bijective and continuous function between topological spaces that has a continuous inverse function. Homeomorphisms are the isomorphisms in the category of topological spaces—that is, they are the mappings that preserve all the topological properties of a given space. Two spaces with a homeomorphism between them are called homeomorphic, and from a topological viewpoint they are the same.

Very roughly speaking, a topological space is a geometric object, and a homeomorphism results from a continuous deformation of the object into a new shape. Thus, a square and a circle are homeomorphic to each other, but a sphere and a torus are not. However, this description can be misleading. Some continuous deformations do not result into homeomorphisms, such as the deformation of a line into a point. Some homeomorphisms do not result from continuous deformations, such as the homeomorphism between a trefoil knot and a circle. Homotopy and isotopy are precise definitions for the informal concept of &quot;continuous deformation&quot;.

==Definition==
A function formula_1 between two topological spaces is a homeomorphism if it has the following properties:

* formula_2 is a bijection (one-to-one and onto),
* formula_2 is continuous,
* the inverse function formula_4 is continuous (formula_2 is an open mapping).

A homeomorphism is sometimes called a &quot;bicontinuous&quot; function. If such a function exists, formula_6 and formula_7 are homeomorphic. A self-homeomorphism is a homeomorphism from a topological space onto itself. Being &quot;homeomorphic&quot; is an equivalence relation on topological spaces. Its equivalence classes are called homeomorphism classes.

The third requirement, that formula_8 be continuous, is essential. Consider for instance the function formula_9 (the unit circle in ) defined byformula_10 This function is bijective and continuous, but not a homeomorphism (formula_11 is compact but formula_12 is not). The function formula_8 is not continuous at the point formula_14 because although formula_8 maps formula_16 to formula_17 any neighbourhood of this point also includes points that the function maps close to formula_18 but the points it maps to numbers in between lie outside the neighbourhood.

Homeomorphisms are the isomorphisms in the category of topological spaces. As such, the composition of two homeomorphisms is again a homeomorphism, and the set of all self-homeomorphisms formula_19 forms a group, called the homeomorphism group of &quot;X&quot;, often denoted formula_20 This group can be given a topology, such as the compact-open topology, which under certain assumptions makes it a topological group.

In some contexts, there are homeomorphic objects that cannot be continuously deformed from one to the other. Homotopy and isotopy are equivalence relations that have been introduced for dealing with such situations.

Similarly, as usual in category theory, given two spaces that are homeomorphic, the space of homeomorphisms between them, formula_21 is a torsor for the homeomorphism groups formula_22 and formula_23 and, given a specific homeomorphism between formula_6 and formula_25 all three sets are identified.

==Examples==

* The open interval formula_26 is homeomorphic to the real numbers for any formula_27 (In this case, a bicontinuous forward mapping is given by formula_28 while other such mappings are given by scaled and translated versions of the or functions).
* The unit 2-disc formula_29 and the unit square in are homeomorphic; since the unit disc can be deformed into the unit square. An example of a bicontinuous mapping from the square to the disc is, in polar coordinates, formula_30
* The graph of a differentiable function is homeomorphic to the domain of the function.
* A differentiable parametrization of a curve is a homeomorphism between the domain of the parametrization and the curve.
* A chart of a manifold is a homeomorphism between an open subset of the manifold and an open subset of a Euclidean space.
* The stereographic projection is a homeomorphism between the unit sphere in with a single point removed and the set of all points in (a 2-dimensional plane). 
* If formula_31 is a topological group, its inversion map formula_32 is a homeomorphism. Also, for any formula_33 the left translation formula_34 the right translation formula_35 and the inner automorphism formula_36 are homeomorphisms.

===Counter-examples===
* and are not homeomorphic for 
* The Euclidean real line is not homeomorphic to the unit circle as a subspace of , since the unit circle is compact as a subspace of Euclidean but the real line is not compact.
*The one-dimensional intervals formula_37 and formula_38 are not homeomorphic because one is compact while the other is not.

==Properties==
* Two homeomorphic spaces share the same topological properties. For example, if one of them is compact, then the other is as well; if one of them is connected, then the other is as well; if one of them is Hausdorff, then the other is as well; their homotopy and homology groups will coincide. Note however that this does not extend to properties defined via a metric; there are metric spaces that are homeomorphic even though one of them is complete and the other is not.
* A homeomorphism is simultaneously an open mapping and a closed mapping; that is, it maps open sets to open sets and closed sets to closed sets.
* Every self-homeomorphism in formula_39 can be extended to a self-homeomorphism of the whole disk formula_40 (Alexander&#x27;s trick).

==Informal discussion==
The intuitive criterion of stretching, bending, cutting and gluing back together takes a certain amount of practice to apply correctly—it may not be obvious from the description above that deforming a line segment to a point is impermissible, for instance. It is thus important to realize that it is the formal definition given above that counts. In this case, for example, the line segment possesses infinitely many points, and therefore cannot be put into a bijection with a set containing only a finite number of points, including a single point.

This characterization of a homeomorphism often leads to a confusion with the concept of homotopy, which is actually &quot;defined&quot; as a continuous deformation, but from one &quot;function&quot; to another, rather than one space to another. In the case of a homeomorphism, envisioning a continuous deformation is a mental tool for keeping track of which points on space &quot;X&quot; correspond to which points on &quot;Y&quot;—one just follows them as &quot;X&quot; deforms. In the case of homotopy, the continuous deformation from one map to the other is of the essence, and it is also less restrictive, since none of the maps involved need to be one-to-one or onto. Homotopy does lead to a relation on spaces: homotopy equivalence.

There is a name for the kind of deformation involved in visualizing a homeomorphism. It is (except when cutting and regluing are required) an isotopy between the identity map on &quot;X&quot; and the homeomorphism from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;.

<text>Hvergelmir (Old Norse &quot;bubbling boiling spring&quot;) is an important primal wellspring in Norse mythology. Hvergelmir is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, Hvergelmir is mentioned in a single stanza, which details that it is the location where liquid from the antlers of the stag Eikþyrnir flow, and that the spring, &quot;whence all waters rise&quot;, is the source of numerous rivers. The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; repeats this information and adds that the spring is located in Niflheim, that it is one of the three major springs at the primary roots of the cosmic tree Yggdrasil (the other two are Urðarbrunnr and Mímisbrunnr), and that within the spring are a vast amount of snakes and the dragon Níðhöggr.

==Attestations==
Hvergelmir is attested in the following works:

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
Hvergelmir receives a single mention in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, found in the poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot;:

This stanza is followed by three stanzas consisting mainly of the names of 42 rivers. Some of these rivers lead to the dwelling of the gods (such as Gömul and Geirvimul), while at least two (Gjöll and Leipt), reach to Hel.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
Hvergelmir is mentioned several times in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Just-as-High explains that the spring Hvergelmir is located in the foggy realm of Niflheim: &quot;It was many ages before the earth was created that Niflheim was made, and in its midst lies a spring called Hvergelmir, and from it flows the rivers called Svol, Gunnthra, Fiorm, Fimbulthul, Slidr and Hrid, Sylg and Ylg, Vid, Leiptr; Gioll is next to Hell-gates.&quot;

Later in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Just-as-High describes the central tree Yggdrasil. Just-as-High says that three roots of the tree support it and &quot;extend very, very far&quot; and that the third of these three roots extends over Niflheim. Beneath this root, says Just-as-High, is the spring Hvergelmir, and that the base of the root is gnawed on by the dragon Níðhöggr. Additionally, High says that Hvergelmir contains not only Níðhöggr but also so many snakes that &quot;no tongue can enumerate them&quot;.

The spring is mentioned a third time in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; where High recounts its source: the stag Eikþyrnir stands on top of the afterlife hall Valhalla feeding branches of Yggdrasil, and from the stag&#x27;s antlers drips great amounts of liquid down into Hvergelmir. High tallies 26 rivers here.

Hvergelmir is mentioned a final time in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; where Third discusses the unpleasantries of Náströnd. Third notes that Hvergelmir yet worse than the venom-filled Náströnd because—by way of quoting a portion of a stanza from the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;—&quot;There Nidhogg torments the bodies of the dead&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, the Hausdorff maximal principle is an alternate and earlier formulation of Zorn&#x27;s lemma proved by Felix Hausdorff in 1914 (Moore 1982:168). It states that in any partially ordered set, every totally ordered subset is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset, where &quot;maximal&quot; is with respect to set inclusion.

In a partially ordered set, a totally ordered subset is also called a chain. Thus, the maximal principle says every chain in the set extends to a maximal chain.

The Hausdorff maximal principle is one of many statements equivalent to the axiom of choice over ZF (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice). The principle is also called the Hausdorff maximality theorem or the Kuratowski lemma (Kelley 1955:33).

==Statement==

The Hausdorff maximal principle states that, in any partially ordered set formula_1, every chain formula_2 (i.e., a totally ordered subset) is contained in a maximal chain formula_3 (i.e., a chain that is not contained in a strictly larger chain in formula_1). In general, there may be several maximal chains containing a given chain.

An equivalent form of the Hausdorff maximal principle is that in every partially ordered set, there exists a maximal chain. (Note if the set is empty, the empty subset is a maximal chain.)

This form follows from the original form since the empty set is a chain. Conversely, to deduce the original form from this form, consider the set formula_5 of all chains in formula_1 containing a given chain formula_2 in formula_1. Then formula_5 is partially ordered by set inclusion. Thus, by the maximal principle in the above form, formula_5 contains a maximal chain formula_11. Let formula_3 be the union of formula_11, which is a chain in formula_1 since a union of a totally ordered set of chains is a chain. Since formula_3 contains formula_2, it is an element of formula_5. Also, since any chain containing formula_3 is contained in formula_3 as formula_3 is a union, formula_3 is in fact a maximal element of formula_5; i.e., a maximal chain in formula_1.

The proof that the Hausdorff maximal principle is equivalent to Zorn&#x27;s lemma is somehow similar to this proof. Indeed, first assume Zorn&#x27;s lemma. Since a union of a totally ordered set of chains is a chain, the hypothesis of Zorn&#x27;s lemma (every chain has an upper bound) is satisfied for formula_5 and thus formula_5 contains a maximal element or a maximal chain in formula_1.

Conversely, if the maximal principle holds, then formula_1 contains a maximal chain formula_3. By the hypothesis of Zorn&#x27;s lemma, formula_3 has an upper bound formula_30 in formula_1. If formula_32, then formula_33 is a chain containing formula_3 and so by maximality, formula_35; i.e., formula_36 and so formula_37. formula_38

== Examples ==
If &quot;A&quot; is any collection of sets, the relation &quot;is a proper subset of&quot; is a strict partial order on &quot;A&quot;. Suppose that &quot;A&quot; is the collection of all circular regions (interiors of circles) in the plane. One maximal totally ordered sub-collection of &quot;A&quot; consists of all circular regions with centers at the origin. Another maximal totally ordered sub-collection consists of all circular regions bounded by circles tangent from the right to the y-axis at the origin.

If (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) are two points of the plane formula_39, define (x0, y0) &lt; (x1, y1) if y0 = y1 and x0 &lt; x1. This is a partial ordering of formula_39 under which two points are comparable only if they lie on the same horizontal line. The maximal totally ordered sets are horizontal lines in formula_39.

== Application ==
By the Hausdorff maximal principle, we can show every Hilbert space formula_42 contains a maximal orthonormal subset formula_43 as follows. (This fact can be stated as saying that formula_44 as Hilbert spaces.)

Let formula_1 be the set of all orthonormal subsets of the given Hilbert space formula_42, which is partially ordered by set inclusion. It is nonempty as it contains the empty set and thus by the maximal principle, it contains a maximal chain formula_47. Let formula_43 be the union of formula_47. We shall show it is a maximal orthonormal subset. First, if formula_50 are in formula_47, then either formula_52 or formula_53. That is, any given two distinct elements in formula_43 are contained in some formula_55 in formula_47 and so they are orthogonal to each other (and of course, formula_43 is a subset of the unit sphere in formula_42). Second, if formula_59 for some formula_60 in formula_1, then formula_60 cannot be in formula_47 and so formula_64 is a chain strictly larger than formula_47, a contradiction. formula_38

For the purpose of comparison, here is a proof of the same fact by Zorn&#x27;s lemma. As above, let formula_1 be the set of all orthonormal subsets of formula_42. If formula_47 is a chain in formula_1, then the union of formula_47 is also orthonormal by the same argument as above and so is an upper bound of formula_47. Thus, by Zorn&#x27;s lemma, formula_1 contains a maximal element formula_43. (So, the difference is that the maximal principle gives a maximal chain while Zorn&#x27;s lemma gives a maximal element directly.)

== Proof 1==
The idea of the proof is essentially due to Zermelo and is to prove the following weak form of Zorn&#x27;s lemma, from the axiom of choice.

:Let formula_75 be a nonempty set of subsets of some fixed set, ordered by set inclusion, such that (1) the union of each totally ordered subset of formula_75 is in formula_75 and (2) each subset of a set in formula_75 is in formula_75. Then formula_75 has a maximal element.

(Zorn&#x27;s lemma itself also follows from this weak form.) The maximal principle follows from the above since the set of all chains in formula_1 satisfies the above conditions.

By the axiom of choice, we have a function formula_82 such that formula_83 for the power set formula_84 of formula_1.

For each formula_86, let formula_87 be the set of all formula_88 such that formula_89 is in formula_75. If formula_91, then let formula_35. Otherwise, let
:formula_93
Note formula_3 is a maximal element if and only if formula_35. Thus, we are done if we can find a formula_3 such that formula_35.

Fix a formula_2 in formula_75. We call a subset formula_100 a &quot;tower (over formula_2)&quot; if

# formula_2 is in formula_103.
# The union of each totally ordered subset formula_104 is in formula_103, where &quot;totally ordered&quot; is with respect to set inclusion.
# For each formula_3 in formula_103, formula_108 is in formula_103.

There exists at least one tower; indeed, the set of all sets in formula_75 containing formula_2 is a tower. Let formula_112 be the intersection of all towers, which is again a tower.

Now, we shall show formula_112 is totally ordered. We say a set formula_3 is &quot;comparable in formula_112&quot; if for each formula_43 in formula_112, either formula_118 or formula_119. Let formula_120 be the set of all sets in formula_112 that are comparable in formula_112. We claim formula_120 is a tower. The conditions 1. and 2. are straightforward to check. For 3., let formula_3 in formula_120 be given and then let formula_126 be the set of all formula_43 in formula_112 such that either formula_118 or formula_130.

We claim formula_126 is a tower. The conditions 1. and 2. are again straightforward to check. For 3., let formula_43 be in formula_126. If formula_118, then since formula_3 is comparable in formula_112, either formula_137 or formula_138. In the first case, formula_139 is in formula_126. In the second case, we have formula_141, which implies either formula_142 or formula_143. (This is the moment we needed to collapse a set to an element by the axiom of choice to define formula_139.) Either way, we have formula_139 is in formula_126. Similarly, if formula_119, we see formula_139 is in formula_126. Hence, formula_126 is a tower. Now, since formula_151 and formula_112 is the intersection of all towers, formula_153, which implies formula_108 is comparable in formula_112; i.e., is in formula_120. This completes the proof of the claim that formula_120 is a tower.

Finally, since formula_120 is a tower contained in formula_112, we have formula_160, which means formula_112 is totally ordered.

Let formula_3 be the union of formula_112. By 2., formula_3 is in formula_112 and then by 3., formula_166 is in formula_112. Since formula_3 is the union of formula_112, formula_170 and thus formula_171. formula_38

== Proof 2==
The Bourbaki–Witt theorem can also be used to prove the Hausdorff maximal principle:

<doc id="13666" wikidata="Q191589" url="?curid=13666" title="Hel (mythological being)">
<text>Hel (Old Norse) is a female being in Norse mythology who is said to preside over an underworld realm of the same name, where she receives a portion of the dead. Hel is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century. In addition, she is mentioned in poems recorded in &quot;Heimskringla&quot; and &quot;Egils saga&quot; that date from the 9th and 10th centuries, respectively. An episode in the Latin work &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, written in the 12th century by Saxo Grammaticus, is generally considered to refer to Hel, and Hel may appear on various Migration Period bracteates.

In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, and &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, Hel is referred to as a daughter of Loki. In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Hel is described as having been appointed by the god Odin as ruler of a realm of the same name, located in Niflheim. In the same source, her appearance is described as half blue and half flesh-coloured and further as having a gloomy, downcast appearance. The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; details that Hel rules over vast mansions with many servants in her underworld realm and plays a key role in the attempted resurrection of the god Baldr.

Scholarly theories have been proposed about Hel&#x27;s potential connections to figures appearing in the 11th-century &quot;Old English Gospel of Nicodemus&quot; and Old Norse &quot;Bartholomeus saga postola&quot;, that she may have been considered a goddess with potential Indo-European parallels in Bhavani, Kali, and Mahakali or that Hel may have become a being only as a late personification of the location of the same name.

==Etymology==
The Old Norse name &quot;Hel&quot; is identical to the name of the location over which she rules. It stems from the Proto-Germanic feminine noun &quot;*haljō-&quot; &#x27;concealed place, the underworld&#x27; (compare with Gothic &quot;halja&quot;, Old English &quot;hel&quot; or &quot;hell&quot;, Old Frisian &quot;helle&quot;, Old Saxon &quot;hellia&quot;, Old High German &quot;hella&quot;), itself a derivative of &quot;*helan-&quot; &#x27;to cover &gt; conceal, hide&#x27; (compare with OE &quot;helan&quot;, OF &quot;hela&quot;, OS &quot;helan&quot;, OHG &quot;helan&quot;). It derives, ultimately, from the Proto-Indo-European verbal root &quot;*ḱel-&quot; &#x27;to conceal, cover, protect&#x27; (compare with Latin &quot;cēlō&quot;, Old Irish &quot;ceilid&quot;, Greek &quot;kalúptō&quot;). The Old Irish masculine noun &quot;cel&quot; &#x27;dissolution, extinction, death&#x27; is also related.

Other related early Germanic terms and concepts include the compounds &quot;*halja-rūnō(n)&quot; and *&quot;halja-wītjan&quot;.&#x27; The feminine noun &quot;*halja-rūnō(n)&quot; is formed with &quot;*haljō-&quot; &#x27;hell&#x27; attached to &quot;*rūno&quot; &#x27;mystery, secret&#x27; &gt; runes. It has descendant cognates in the Old English &quot;helle-rúne&quot; &#x27;possessed woman, sorceress, diviner&#x27;, the Old High German &quot;helli-rūna&quot; &#x27;magic&#x27;, and perhaps in the Latinized Gothic form &quot;haliurunnae&quot;,&#x27; although its second element may derive instead from &quot;rinnan&quot; &#x27;to run, go&#x27;, leading to Gothic &quot;*haljurunna&quot; as the &#x27;one who travels to the netherworld&#x27;. The neutral noun *&quot;halja-wītjan&quot; is composed of the same root &quot;*haljō-&quot; attached to *&quot;wītjan&quot; (compare with Goth. &quot;un-witi&quot; &#x27;foolishness, understanding&#x27;, OE &quot;witt&quot; &#x27;right mind, wits&#x27;, OHG &quot;wizzi&quot; &#x27;understanding&#x27;), with descendant cognates in Old Norse &quot;hel-víti&quot; &#x27;hell&#x27;, Old English &quot;helle-wíte&quot; &#x27;hell-torment, hell&#x27;, Old Saxon helli-wīti &#x27;hell&#x27;, or Middle High German &quot;helle-wīzi&quot; &#x27;hell&#x27;.&quot;&quot;

&quot;Hel&quot; is also etymologically related—although distantly in this case—to the Old Norse word &quot;Valhöll&quot; &#x27;Valhalla&#x27;, literally &#x27;hall of the slain&#x27;, and to the English word &quot;hall&quot;, both likewise deriving from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*ḱel-&quot; via the Proto-Germanic root *&quot;hallō-&quot; &#x27;covered place, hall&#x27;.

==Attestations==
===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
The &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, features various poems that mention Hel. In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, Hel&#x27;s realm is referred to as the &quot;Halls of Hel&quot;. In stanza 31 of &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, Hel is listed as living beneath one of three roots growing from the world tree Yggdrasil. In &quot;Fáfnismál&quot;, the hero Sigurd stands before the mortally wounded body of the dragon Fáfnir, and states that Fáfnir lies in pieces, where &quot;Hel can take&quot; him. In &quot;Atlamál&quot;, the phrases &quot;Hel has half of us&quot; and &quot;sent off to Hel&quot; are used in reference to death, though it could be a reference to the location and not the being, if not both. In stanza 4 of &quot;Baldrs draumar&quot;, Odin rides towards the &quot;high hall of Hel&quot;.

Hel may also be alluded to in &quot;Hamðismál&quot;. Death is paraphrased as &quot;joy of the troll-woman&quot; (or &quot;ogress&quot;) and ostensibly it is Hel being referred to as the troll-woman or the ogre (&quot;flagð&quot;), although it may otherwise be some unspecified &quot;dís&quot;.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===

Hel receives notable mention in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. In chapter 34 of the book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Hel is listed by High as one of the three children of Loki and Angrboða; the wolf Fenrir, the serpent Jörmungandr, and Hel. High continues that, once the gods found that these three children are being brought up in the land of Jötunheimr, and when the gods &quot;traced prophecies that from these siblings great mischief and disaster would arise for them&quot; then the gods expected a lot of trouble from the three children, partially due to the nature of the mother of the children, yet worse so due to the nature of their father.

High says that Odin sent the gods to gather the children and bring them to him. Upon their arrival, Odin threw Jörmungandr into &quot;that deep sea that lies round all lands&quot;, Odin threw Hel into Niflheim, and bestowed upon her authority over nine worlds, in that she must &quot;administer board and lodging to those sent to her, and that is those who die of sickness or old age&quot;. High details that in this realm Hel has &quot;great Mansions&quot; with extremely high walls and immense gates, a hall called Éljúðnir, a dish called &quot;Hunger&quot;, a knife called &quot;Famine&quot;, the servant Ganglati (Old Norse &quot;lazy walker&quot;), the serving-maid Ganglöt (also &quot;lazy walker&quot;), the entrance threshold &quot;Stumbling-block&quot;, the bed &quot;Sick-bed&quot;, and the curtains &quot;Gleaming-bale&quot;. High describes Hel as &quot;half black and half flesh-coloured&quot;, adding that this makes her easily recognizable, and furthermore that Hel is &quot;rather downcast and fierce-looking&quot;.

In chapter 49, High describes the events surrounding the death of the god Baldr. The goddess Frigg asks who among the Æsir will earn &quot;all her love and favour&quot; by riding to Hel, the location, to try to find Baldr, and offer Hel herself a ransom. The god Hermóðr volunteers and sets off upon the eight-legged horse Sleipnir to Hel. Hermóðr arrives in Hel&#x27;s hall, finds his brother Baldr there, and stays the night. The next morning, Hermóðr begs Hel to allow Baldr to ride home with him, and tells her about the great weeping the Æsir have done upon Baldr&#x27;s death. Hel says the love people have for Baldr that Hermóðr has claimed must be tested, stating:

If all things in the world, alive or dead, weep for him, then he will be allowed to return to the Æsir. If anyone speaks against him or refuses to cry, then he will remain with Hel.

Later in the chapter, after the female jötunn Þökk refuses to weep for the dead Baldr, she responds in verse, ending with &quot;let Hel hold what she has&quot;. In chapter 51, High describes the events of Ragnarök, and details that when Loki arrives at the field Vígríðr &quot;all of Hel&#x27;s people&quot; will arrive with him.

In chapter 12 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Hel is mentioned in a kenning for Baldr (&quot;Hel&#x27;s companion&quot;). In chapter 23, &quot;Hel&#x27;s [...] relative or father&quot; is given as a kenning for Loki. In chapter 50, Hel is referenced (&quot;to join the company of the quite monstrous wolf&#x27;s sister&quot;) in the skaldic poem &quot;Ragnarsdrápa&quot;.

===&quot;Heimskringla&quot;===
In the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; book &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, Hel is referred to, though never by name. In chapter 17, the king Dyggvi dies of sickness. A poem from the 9th-century &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; that forms the basis of &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; is then quoted that describes Hel&#x27;s taking of Dyggvi:

In chapter 45, a section from &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; is given which refers to Hel as &quot;howes&#x27;-warder&quot; (meaning &quot;guardian of the graves&quot;) and as taking King Halfdan Hvitbeinn from life. In chapter 46, King Eystein Halfdansson dies by being knocked overboard by a sail yard. A section from &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; follows, describing that Eystein &quot;fared to&quot; Hel (referred to as &quot;Býleistr&#x27;s-brother&#x27;s-daughter&quot;). In chapter 47, the deceased Eystein&#x27;s son King Halfdan dies of an illness, and the excerpt provided in the chapter describes his fate thereafter, a portion of which references Hel:

In a stanza from &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; recorded in chapter 72 of the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; book &quot;Saga of Harald Sigurdsson&quot;, &quot;given to Hel&quot; is again used as a phrase to referring to death.

===&quot;Egils saga&quot;===
The Icelanders&#x27; saga &quot;Egils saga&quot; contains the poem &quot;Sonatorrek&quot;. The saga attributes the poem to 10th-century skald Egill Skallagrímsson, and writes that it was composed by Egill after the death of his son Gunnar. The final stanza of the poem contains a mention of Hel, though not by name:

===&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;===
In the account of Baldr&#x27;s death in Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; early 13th century work &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, the dying Baldr has a dream visitation from Proserpina (here translated as &quot;the goddess of death&quot;):

The following night the goddess of death appeared to him in a dream standing at his side, and declared that in three days time she would clasp him in her arms. It was no idle vision, for after three days the acute pain of his injury brought his end.

Scholars have assumed that Saxo used Proserpina as a goddess equivalent to the Norse Hel.

==Archaeological record==
It has been suggested that several imitation medallions and bracteates of the Migration Period (ca. first centuries AD) feature depictions of Hel. In particular the bracteates IK 14 and IK 124 depict a rider traveling down a slope and coming upon a female being holding a scepter or a staff. The downward slope may indicate that the rider is traveling towards the realm of the dead and the woman with the scepter may be a female ruler of that realm, corresponding to Hel.

Some B-class bracteates showing three godly figures have been interpreted as depicting Baldr&#x27;s death, the best known of these is the Fakse bracteate. Two of the figures are understood to be Baldr and Odin while both Loki and Hel have been proposed as candidates for the third figure. If it is Hel she is presumably greeting the dying Baldr as he comes to her realm.

==Scholarly reception==

===Seo Hell===
The &quot;Old English Gospel of Nicodemus&quot;, preserved in two manuscripts from the 11th century, contains a female figure referred to as &quot;Seo hell&quot; who engages in flyting with Satan and tells him to leave her dwelling (Old English &quot;ut of mynre onwununge&quot;). Regarding Seo Hell in the &quot;Old English Gospel of Nicodemus&quot;, Michael Bell states that &quot;her vivid personification in a dramatically excellent scene suggests that her gender is more than grammatical, and invites comparison with the Old Norse underworld goddess Hel and the Frau Holle of German folklore, to say nothing of underworld goddesses in other cultures&quot; yet adds that &quot;the possibility that these genders &quot;are&quot; merely grammatical is strengthened by the fact that an Old Norse version of Nicodemus, possibly translated under English influence, personifies Hell in the neutral (Old Norse &quot;þat helvíti&quot;)&quot;.

===&quot;Bartholomeus saga postola&quot;===
The Old Norse &quot;Bartholomeus saga postola&quot;, an account of the life of Saint Bartholomew dating from the 13th century, mentions a &quot;Queen Hel&quot;. In the story, a devil is hiding within a pagan idol, and bound by Bartholomew&#x27;s spiritual powers to acknowledge himself and confess, the devil refers to Jesus as the one which &quot;made war on Hel our queen&quot; (Old Norse &quot;heriaði a Hel drottning vara&quot;). &quot;Queen Hel&quot; is not mentioned elsewhere in the saga.

Michael Bell says that while Hel &quot;might at first appear to be identical with the well-known pagan goddess of the Norse underworld&quot; as described in chapter 34 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, &quot;in the combined light of the Old English and Old Norse versions of &quot;Nicodemus&quot; she casts quite a different a shadow&quot;, and that in &quot;Bartholomeus saga postola&quot; &quot;she is clearly the queen of the Christian, not pagan, underworld&quot;.

===Origins and development===
Jacob Grimm described Hel as an example of a &quot;half-goddess&quot;: &quot;one who cannot be shown to be either wife or daughter of a god, and who stands in a dependent relation to higher divinities&quot;, and argued that &quot;half-goddesses&quot; stand higher than &quot;half-gods&quot; in Germanic mythology. Grimm regarded Hel (whom he refers to here as &quot;Halja&quot;, the theorized Proto-Germanic form of the term) as essentially an &quot;image of a greedy, unrestoring, female deity&quot; and theorized that &quot;the higher we are allowed to penetrate into our antiquities, the less hellish and more godlike may &quot;Halja&quot; appear&quot;. He compared her role, her black color, and her name to &quot;the Indian Bhavani, who travels about and bathes like Nerthus and Holda, but is likewise called &quot;Kali&quot; or &quot;Mahakali&quot;, the great &quot;black&quot; goddess&quot; and concluded that &quot;&quot;Halja&quot; is one of the oldest and commonest conceptions of our heathenism&quot;. He theorized that the Helhest, a three-legged horse that in Danish folklore roams the countryside &quot;as a harbinger of plague and pestilence&quot;, was originally the steed of the goddess Hel, and that on this steed Hel roamed the land &quot;picking up the dead that were her due&quot;. He also says that a wagon was once ascribed to Hel.

In her 1948 work on death in Norse mythology and religion, &quot;The Road to Hel&quot;, Hilda Ellis Davidson argued that the description of Hel as a goddess in surviving sources appeared to be literary personification, the word &quot;hel&quot; generally being &quot;used simply to signify death or the grave&quot;, which she states &quot;naturally lends itself to personification by poets&quot;. While noting that &quot;whether this personification has originally been based on a belief in a goddess of death called Hel [was] another question&quot;, she stated that she did not believe the surviving sources gave any reason to believe so, while they included various other examples of &quot;supernatural women&quot; who &quot;seem to have been closely connected with the world of death, and were pictured as welcoming dead warriors&quot;. She suggested that the depiction of Hel &quot;as a goddess&quot; in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; &quot;might well owe something to these&quot;.

In a later work (1998), Davidson wrote that the description of Hel found in chapter 33 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; &quot;hardly suggests a goddess&quot;, but that &quot;in the account of Hermod&#x27;s ride to Hel later in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; (49)&quot;, Hel &quot;[speaks] with authority as ruler of the underworld&quot; and that from her realm &quot;gifts are sent back to Frigg and Fulla by Balder&#x27;s wife Nanna as from a friendly kingdom&quot;. She posited that Snorri may have &quot;earlier turned the goddess of death into an allegorical figure, just as he made Hel, the underworld of shades, a place &#x27;where wicked men go,&#x27; like the Christian Hell (&quot;Gylfaginning&quot; 3)&quot;. She then, like Grimm, compared Hel to Kali:

On the other hand, a goddess of death who represents the horrors of slaughter and decay is something well known elsewhere; the figure of Kali in India is an outstanding example. Like Snorri&#x27;s Hel, she is terrifying to in appearance, black or dark in colour, usually naked, adorned with severed heads or arms or the corpses of children, her lips smeared with blood. She haunts the battlefield or cremation ground and squats on corpses. Yet for all this she is &quot;the recipient of ardent devotion from countless devotees who approach her as their mother&quot; [...].

Davidson further compared Hel to early attestations of the Irish goddesses Badb (described in &quot;The Destruction of Da Choca&#x27;s Hostel&quot; as dark in color, with a large mouth, wearing a dusky mantle, and with gray hair falling over her shoulders, or, alternatively, &quot;as a red figure on the edge of the ford, washing the chariot of a king doomed to die&quot;) and the Morrígan. She concluded that, in these examples, &quot;here we have the fierce destructive side of death, with a strong emphasis on its physical horrors, so perhaps we should not assume that the gruesome figure of Hel is wholly Snorri&#x27;s literary invention&quot;.

John Lindow stated that most details about Hel, as a figure, are not found outside of Snorri&#x27;s writing in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, and that when older skaldic poetry &quot;says that people are &#x27;in&#x27; rather than &#x27;with&#x27; Hel, we are clearly dealing with a place rather than a person, and this is assumed to be the older conception&quot;. He theorizes that the noun and place &quot;Hel&quot; likely originally simply meant &quot;grave&quot;, and that &quot;the personification came later&quot;. Lindow also drew a parallel between the personified Hel&#x27;s banishment to the underworld and the binding of Fenrir as part of a recurring theme of the bound monster, where an enemy of the gods is bound but destined to break free at Ragnarok. Rudolf Simek similarly stated that the figure of Hel is &quot;probably a very late personification of the underworld Hel&quot;, that &quot;on the whole nothing speaks in favour of there being a belief in Hel in pre-Christian times&quot;, and noted that &quot;the first scriptures using the goddess Hel are found at the end of the 10th and in the 11th centuries&quot;. He characterized the allegorical description of Hel&#x27;s house in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; as &quot;clearly ... in the Christian tradition&quot;. However, elsewhere in the same work, Simek cites an argument made by that one of three figures appearing together on Migration Period B-bracteates is to be interpreted as Hel.

==As a given name==
In January 2017, the Icelandic Naming Committee ruled that parents could not name their child &quot;Hel&quot; &quot;on the grounds that the name would cause the child significant distress and trouble as it grows up&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Hel is one of the playable gods in the third-person multiplayer online battle arena game &quot;Smite&quot; and was one of the original 17 gods. Hel is also featured in Ensemble Studios&#x27; 2002 real-time strategy game &quot;Age of Mythology&quot;, where she is one of 12 gods Norse players can choose to worship.

=== Hela ===
Hel was the inspiration for the Marvel comic book character Hela, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby; Hela first appeared in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #102 (March 1964). In the widely popular &quot;&quot; (2017), Hela is portrayed as &quot;violent, vicious, brutal and cruel&quot;.

<text>The Hawar Islands (; transliterated: &quot;Juzur Ḥawār&quot;) are an archipelago of desert islands; all but one are owned by Bahrain, while the southern, small, and uninhabited Jinan Island (Arabic: جزيرة جينان; transliterated: &quot;Jazirat Jinan&quot;) is administered by Qatar as part of its Al-Shahaniya municipality. The archipelago is situated off the west coast of Qatar in the Gulf of Bahrain of the Persian Gulf.

==Description==
The islands used to be one of the settlements of the Bahraini branch of the Dawasir who settled there in the early 19th century. The islands were first surveyed in 1820, when they were called the Warden&#x27;s Islands, and two villages were recorded. They are now uninhabited, other than a police garrison and a hotel on the main island; access to all but Hawar island itself is severely restricted. Local fishermen are allowed to fish in adjacent waters and there is some recreational fishing and tourism on and around the islands. Fresh water has always been scarce; historically it was obtained by surface collection and even today, with the desalination plant, additional supplies have to be brought in.

==Geography==
Despite their proximity to Qatar (they are only about from the Qatari mainland whilst being about from the main islands of Bahrain), most of the islands belong to Bahrain, having been a part of a dispute between Bahrain and Qatar which was resolved in 2001. The islands were formerly coincident with the district or &quot;Minṭaqat&quot; Juzur Ḥawār (مِنْطَقَة جُزُر حَوَار) and are now administered as part of the Southern Governorate of Bahrain. The land area of the islands is approximately .

Although there are 36 islands in the group, many of the smaller islands are little more than sand or shingle accumulations on areas of exposed bedrock molded by the ongoing processes of sedimentation and accretion.
The World Heritage Site application named 8 major islands (see table hereafter), which conforms to the description of the islands when first surveyed as consisting of 8 or 9 islands. 
It has often been described as an archipelago of 16 islands. Janan Island, to the south of Hawar island, is not legally considered to be a part of the group and is owned by Qatar.

==Flora and fauna==
There are small herds of Arabian oryx and sand gazelle on Hawar island, and the seas around support sea turtles and a large population of dugongs.

The islands are home to many bird species. The archipelago has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of western reef egrets, Socotra cormorants (with some 200,000–300,000 adults recorded in 1992, making it the largest known breeding concentration in the world), Saunders&#x27;s and white-cheeked terns, and sooty falcons. Other breeding birds include Caspian and bridled terns, and ospreys. Wintering birds include great crested grebes and greater flamingos.

===Conservation===
The islands were listed as a Ramsar site in 1997. In 2002, the Bahraini government applied to have the islands recognised as a World Heritage Site due to their unique environment and habitat for endangered species; the application was ultimately unsuccessful.


==Administration==
The islands were formerly coincident with the region or &quot;Minṭaqat&quot; Juzur Ḥawār (مِنْطَقَة جُزُر حَوَار) and are now administered as part of the Southern Governorate of Bahrain.

Jinan Island is administered as part of Al-Shahaniya Municipality of Qatar.

==Access==
The islands&#x27; ecology draws numerous birds, oryx, gazelles, and Socotra cormorants. The islands are connected through a short ferry ride from Manama and are reported to have a potential to be developed as a beach tourism destination.

== List of islands ==
=== Hawar archipelago ===
By far the largest island is Hawar, which accounts for more than of the land area. Following in size are Suwād al Janūbīyah, Suwād ash Shamālīyah, Rubud Al Sharqiyah, Rubud Al Gharbiyah, and Muhazwarah (Umm Hazwarah).

The following were not considered as part of the Hawar islands in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) judgment, being located between Hawar and the Bahrain Islands and not disputed by Qatar, but have been included in the Hawar archipelago by the Bahrain government as part of the 2002 World Heritage Site application.

=== Janan Island ===

Janan (or Jinan) Island, a small island south of Hawar island, was also considered in the 2001 judgment. Based on a previous agreement when both Qatar and Bahrain were under British occupation, it was judged to be separate from the Hawar islands and so considered by the court separately. It was awarded to Qatar.

<text>Hans-Dietrich Genscher (21 March 1927 – 31 March 2016) was a German statesman and a member of the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), who served as Federal Minister of the Interior from 1969 to 1974, and as Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs and Vice Chancellor of Germany from 1974 to 1992 (except for a two-week break in 1982, after the FDP had left the Third Schmidt cabinet), making him the longest-serving occupant of either post and the only person to have held one of these positions under two different Chancellors of the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1991 he was chairman of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

A proponent of Realpolitik, Genscher has been called &quot;a master of diplomacy&quot;. He is widely regarded as having been a principal &quot;architect of German reunification&quot;. In 1991, he played a pivotal role in international diplomacy surrounding the breakup of Yugoslavia by successfully pushing for international recognition of Croatia, Slovenia and other republics declaring independence, in an effort to halt &quot;a trend towards a Greater Serbia&quot;. After leaving office, he worked as a lawyer and international consultant. He was President of the German Council on Foreign Relations and was involved with several international organisations, and with former Czech President Václav Havel, he called for a Cold War museum to be built in Berlin.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Genscher was born on 21 March 1927 in Reideburg (Province of Saxony Anhalt), now a part of Halle, in what later became East Germany. He was the son of Hilda Kreime and Kurt Genscher. His father, a lawyer, died when Genscher was nine years old. In 1943, he was drafted to serve as a member of the Air Force Support Personnel (&quot;Luftwaffenhelfer&quot;) at the age of 16. At age 17, close to the end of the war, he and his fellow soldiers became members of the Nazi Party due to a collective application (&quot;Sammelantrag&quot;) by his Wehrmacht unit. He later said he was unaware of it at the time.

Late in the war, Genscher was deployed as a soldier in General Walther Wenck&#x27;s 12th Army, which ostensibly was directed to relieve the siege of Berlin. After the German surrender he was an American and British prisoner of war, but was released after two months. Following World War II, he studied law and economics at the universities of Halle and Leipzig (1946–1949) and joined the East German Liberal Democratic Party (LDPD) in 1946.

=== Political career ===
In 1952, Genscher fled to West Germany, where he joined the Free Democratic Party (FDP). He passed his second state examination in law in Hamburg in 1954 and became a solicitor in Bremen. During these early years after the war, Genscher continuously struggled with illness. From 1956 to 1959 he was a research assistant of the FDP parliamentary group in Bonn. From 1959 to 1965 he was the FDP group managing director, while from 1962 to 1964 he was National Secretary of the FDP.

In 1965 Genscher was elected on the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP list to the West German parliament and remained a member of parliament until his retirement in 1998. He was elected deputy national chairman in 1968. From 1969 he served as minister of the interior in the SPD-FDP coalition government led by Chancellor Willy Brandt.

In 1974 he became foreign minister and vice chancellor, both posts he would hold for 18 years. From 1 October 1974 to 23 February 1985 he was Chairman of the FDP. It was during his tenure as party chairman that the FDP switched from being the junior member of social-liberal coalition to being the junior member of the 1982 coalition with the CDU/CSU. In 1985 he gave up the post of national chairman. After his resignation as Foreign Minister, Genscher was appointed honorary chairman of the FDP in 1992.

== Federal Minister of the Interior ==
After the federal election of 1969 Genscher was instrumental in the formation of the social-liberal coalition of chancellor Willy Brandt and was on 22 October 1969 appointed as federal minister of the interior. 
In 1972, while minister for the interior, Genscher rejected Israel&#x27;s offer to send an Israeli special forces unit to Germany to deal with the Munich Olympics hostage crisis. He offered himself as a hostage under the condition that the Israeli athletes would be released, but the leader of the terror group rejected that offer. A flawed rescue attempt by German police forces at Fürstenfeldbruck air base resulted in a bloody shootout, which left all eleven hostages, five terrorists, and one German policeman dead. Genscher then offered to resign as Minister of the Interior to chancellor Brandt, but Brandt rejected the offer. Genscher&#x27;s popularity with Israel declined further when he endorsed the release of the three captured attackers following the hijacking of a Lufthansa aircraft on 29 October 1972.

In the SPD–FDP coalition, Genscher helped shape Brandt&#x27;s policy of deescalation with the communist East, commonly known as &quot;Ostpolitik&quot;, which was continued under chancellor Helmut Schmidt after Brandt&#x27;s resignation in 1974. He would later be a driving factor in continuing this policy in the new conservative-liberal coalition under Helmut Kohl.

== Vice Chancellor and Federal Foreign Minister ==
In the negotiations on a coalition government of SPD and FDP following the 1976 elections, it took Genscher 73 days to reach agreement with Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.

As Foreign Minister, Genscher stood for a policy of compromise between East and West, and developed strategies for an active policy of détente and the continuation of the East–West dialogue with the USSR. He was widely regarded a strong advocate of negotiated settlements to international problems. As a popular story on Genscher&#x27;s preferred method of shuttle diplomacy has it, &quot;two Lufthansa jets crossed over the Atlantic, and Genscher was on both&quot;.
Genscher was a major player in the negotiations on the text of the Helsinki Accords. In December 1976, the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York City accepted Genscher&#x27;s proposal of an anti-terrorism convention in New York, which was set among other things, to respond to demands from hostage-takers under any circumstances.

Genscher was one of the FDP&#x27;s driving forces when, in 1982, the party switched sides from its coalition with the SPD to support the CDU/CSU in their Constructive vote of no confidence to have incumbent Helmut Schmidt replaced with opposition leader Helmut Kohl as Chancellor. The reason for this was the increase in the differences between the coalition partners, particularly in economic and social policy. The switch was controversial, not least in his own party.

At several points in his tenure, he irritated the governments of the United States and other allies of Germany by appearing not to support Western initiatives fully. &quot;During the Cold War, his penchant to seek the middle ground at times exasperated United States policy-makers who wanted a more decisive, less equivocal Germany&quot;, according to Tyler Marshall. Genscher&#x27;s perceived quasi-neutralism was dubbed &quot;Genscherism&quot;. &quot;Fundamental to &quot;Genscherism&quot; was said to be the belief that Germany could play a role as a bridge between East and West without losing its status as a reliable NATO ally.&quot; In the 1980s, Genscher opposed the deployment of new short-range NATO missiles in Germany. At the time, the Reagan Administration questioned whether Germany was straying from the Western alliance and following a program of its own.

In 1984, Genscher became the first Western foreign minister to visit Tehran since the Iranian Revolution of 1979. In 1988, he appointed Jürgen Hellner as West Germany&#x27;s new ambassador to Libya, a post that had been vacant since the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing, a tragedy which U.S. officials blamed on the government of Muammar Gaddafi.

Genscher&#x27;s proposals frequently set the tone and direction of foreign affairs among Western Europe&#x27;s democracies. He was also an active participant in the further development of the European Union, taking an active part in the Single European Act Treaty negotiations in the mid-1980s, as well as the joint publication of the Genscher-Colombo plan with Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Emilio Colombo which advocated further integration and deepening of relations in the European Union towards a more federal Europe. He later was among the politicians who pushed hard for monetary union alongside Edouard Balladur, France&#x27;s finance minister, and Giuliano Amato, circulating a memorandum to that effect.

Genscher retained his posts as foreign minister and vice chancellor through German reunification and until 1992 when he stepped down for health reasons.

=== Reunification efforts ===

Genscher is most respected for his efforts that helped spell the end of the Cold War, in the late 1980s when Communist eastern European governments toppled, and which led to German reunification. During his time in office, he focused on maintaining stability and balance between the West and the Soviet bloc. From the beginning, he argued that the West should seek cooperation with Communist governments rather than treat them as implacably hostile; this policy was embraced by many Germans and other Europeans.

Genscher had great interest in European integration and the success of German reunification. He soon pushed for effective support of political reform processes in Poland and Hungary. For this purpose, he visited Poland to meet the chairman of Solidarity Lech Wałęsa as early as January 1980. Especially from 1987 he campaigned for an &quot;active relaxation&quot; policy response by the West to the Soviet efforts. In the years before German reunification, he made a point of maintaining strong ties with his birthplace Halle, which was regarded as significant by admirers and critics alike.

When thousands of East Germans sought refuge in West German embassies in Czechoslovakia and Poland, Genscher held discussions on the refugee crisis at the United Nations in New York with the foreign ministers of Czechoslovakia, Poland, East Germany and the Soviet Union in September 1989. Genscher&#x27;s 30 September 1989 speech from the balcony of the German embassy in Prague was an important milestone on the road to the end of the GDR. In the embassy courtyard thousands of East German citizens had assembled. They were trying to travel to West Germany, but were being denied permission to travel by the Czechoslovak government at the request of East Germany. He announced that he had reached an agreement with the Communist Czechoslovak government that the refugees could leave: &quot;We have come to you to tell you that today, your departure ...&quot; (German: &quot;Wir sind zu Ihnen gekommen, um Ihnen mitzuteilen, dass heute Ihre Ausreise ...&quot;). After these words, the speech was drowned in cheers.

With his fellow foreign ministers James Baker of the United States and Eduard Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union, Genscher is widely credited with securing Germany&#x27;s subsequent peaceful unification and the withdrawal of Soviet forces. He negotiated the German reunification in 1990 with his counterpart from the GDR, Markus Meckel. On 12 September 1990 he signed the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany on behalf of West Germany. In November 1990, Genscher and his Polish counterpart Krzysztof Skubiszewski signed the German-Polish Border Treaty on the establishment of the Oder–Neisse line as Poland&#x27;s western border. Meanwhile, he strongly endorsed the plans of the Bush Administration to assure continued U.S. influence in a post-Cold War Europe.

=== Post-reunification ===
In 1991, Genscher successfully pushed for Germany&#x27;s recognition of the Republic of Croatia in the Croatian War of Independence shortly after JNA entered Vukovar. After Croatia and Slovenia had declared independence, Genscher concluded that Yugoslavia could not be held together, and that republics that wanted to break from the Serbian-dominated federation deserved quick diplomatic recognition. He hoped that such recognition would stop the fighting. The rest of the European Union was subsequently pressured to follow suit soon afterward. The UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar had warned the German Government, that a recognition of Slovenia and Croatia would lead to an increase in aggression in the former Yugoslavia.

At a meeting of the European Community&#x27;s foreign ministers in 1991, Genscher proposed to press for a war crimes trial for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, accusing him of aggression against Kuwait, using chemical weapons against civilians and condoning genocide against the Kurds.

During the Gulf War, Genscher sought to deal with Iraq after other Western leaders had decided to go to war to force it out of Kuwait. Germany made a substantial financial contribution to the allied cause but, citing constitutional restrictions on the use of its armed forces, provided almost no military assistance. In January 1991, Germany sent Genscher on a state visit to Israel and followed up with an agreement to provide the Jewish state with $670 million in military aid, including financing for two submarines long coveted by Israel, a battery of Patriot missiles to defend against Iraqi missiles, 58 armored vehicles specially fitted to detect chemical and biological attacks, and a shipment of gas masks. When, in the aftermath of the war, a far-reaching political debate broke out over how Germany should fulfill its global responsibilities, Genscher responded that if foreign powers expect Germany to assume greater responsibility in the world, they should give it a chance to express its views &quot;more strongly&quot; in the United Nations Security Council. He also famously held that &quot;whatever floats is fine, whatever rolls is not&quot; to sum up Germany&#x27;s military export policy for restless countries – based on a navy&#x27;s unsuitability for use against a country&#x27;s own people.

In 1992, Genscher, together with his Danish colleague Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, took the initiative to create the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) and the EuroFaculty.

More than half a century after Nazi leaders assembled their infamous exhibition &quot;Degenerate Art&quot;, a sweeping condemnation of the work of the avant-garde, Genscher opened a re-creation of the show at the Altes Museum in March 1992, describing Nazi attempts to restrict artistic expression as &quot;a step toward the catastrophe that produced the mass murder of European Jews and the war of extermination against Germany&#x27;s neighbors.&quot; &quot;The paintings in this exhibition have survived oppression and censorship&quot;, he asserted in his opening remarks. &quot;They are not only a monument but also a sign of hope. They stand for the triumph of creative freedom over barbarism.&quot;

On 18 May 1992, Genscher retired at his own request from the federal government, which he had been member of for a total of 23 years. At the time, he was the world&#x27;s longest-serving foreign minister and Germany&#x27;s most popular politician. He had announced his decision three weeks earlier, on 27 April 1992. Genscher did not specify his reasons for quitting; however, he had suffered two heart attacks by that time. His resignation took effect in May, but he remained a member of parliament and continued to be influential in the Free Democratic Party.

Following Genscher&#x27;s resignation, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and FDP chairman Otto Graf Lambsdorff named Irmgard Schwaetzer, a former aide to Genscher, to be the new Foreign Minister. In a surprise decision, however, a majority of the FDP parliamentary group rejected her nomination and voted instead to name Justice Minister Klaus Kinkel to head the Foreign Ministry.

== Activities after politics ==

Ahead of the German presidential election in 1994, Genscher proclaimed his lack of interest in the position, but was nonetheless widely considered a leading contender. After a poll taken for &quot;Stern&quot; magazine showed him to be the favored candidate of 48 percent of German voters, he reiterated in 1993 that he would &quot;in no case&quot; accept the presidency.

Having finished his political career, Genscher remained active as a lawyer and in international organizations. In late 1992, Genscher was appointed chairman of a newly established donors&#x27; board of the Berlin State Opera. Between 1997 and 2010, Genscher was affiliated with the law firm Büsing, Müffelmann &amp; Theye. He founded his own consulting firm, Hans-Dietrich Genscher Consult GmbH, in 2000. Between 2001 and 2003, he served as president of the German Council on Foreign Relations. In 2001, Genscher headed an arbitration that ended a monthlong battle between German airline Lufthansa and its pilots&#x27; union and resulted in an agreement on increasing wages by more than 15 percent by the end of the following year.

In 2008, Genscher joined former Czech President Václav Havel, former United States Ambassador to Germany John Kornblum and several other well-known political figures in calling for a Cold War museum to be built at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin. In 2009 Genscher expressed public concern at Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s lifting of excommunication of the bishops of the Society of Saint Pius X. Genscher wrote in the &quot;Mitteldeutsche Zeitung&quot;: &quot;Poles can be proud of Pope John Paul II. At the last papal election, we said We are the pope! But please—not like this.&quot; He argued that Pope Benedict XVI was making a habit of offending non-Catholics. &quot;This is a deep moral and political question. It is about respect for the victims of crimes against humanity&quot;, Genscher said.

On 20 December 2013, it was revealed that Genscher played a key role in coordinating the release and flight to Germany of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former head of Yukos. Genscher had first met Khodorkovsky in 2002 and had chaired a conference at which Khodorkovsky blasted Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s pursuit of his oil company. Khodorkovsky asked his lawyers during a 2011 prison visit to let Genscher help mediate early release. Once Putin was re-elected in 2012, German Chancellor Angela Merkel instructed her officials to lobby for the president to meet Genscher. The subsequent negotiations involved two meetings between Genscher and Putin – one at Berlin Tegel Airport at the end of Putin&#x27;s first visit to Germany after he was re-elected in 2012, the other in Moscow. While keeping the chancellor informed, Khodorkovsky&#x27;s attorneys and Genscher spent the ensuing months developing a variety of legal avenues that could allow Putin to release his former rival early, ranging from amendments to existing laws to clemency. When Khodorkovsky&#x27;s mother was in a Berlin hospital with cancer in November 2013, Genscher passed a message to Khodorkovsky suggesting the prisoner should write a pardon letter to Putin emphasizing his mother&#x27;s ill health. Following Putin&#x27;s pardoning of Khodorkovsky &quot;for humanitarian reasons&quot; in December 2013, a private plane provided by Genscher brought Khodorkovsky to Berlin for a family reunion at the Hotel Adlon.

Genscher signed on in 2014 to be a member of the Southern Corridor Advisory Panel, a BP-led consortium which includes former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Peter Sutherland, chairman of Goldman Sachs International. The panel&#x27;s purpose is to facilitate the expansion of a vast natural-gas field in the Caspian Sea and the building of two pipelines across Europe. The $45 billion enterprise, championed by the Azerbaijani president, Ilham Aliyev, has been called by critics &quot;the Blair Rich Project&quot;.

== Death ==
Genscher died at his home outside Bonn in Wachtberg on 31 March 2016 from heart failure, 10 days after his 89th birthday.

<text>Henry Ainsworth (1571–1622) was an English Nonconformist clergyman and scholar. He led the Ancient Church, a Brownist or English Separatist congregation in Amsterdam alongside Francis Johnson from 1597, and after their split led his own congregation. His translations of and commentaries on the Hebrew scriptures were influential for centuries.

==Separatist career==

Ainsworth was born of a farming family of Swanton Morley, Norfolk. He was educated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, later moving to Caius College, but left without a degree. After associating with the Puritan party in the Church, he joined the Brownists, but submitted to the Church of England after being arrested in London, and again when he was arrested in Ireland.

By 1597, Ainsworth moved to Amsterdam and found a home in &quot;a blind lane at Amsterdam&quot;, working as porter to a bookseller, and lived in severe poverty. According to Roger Williams, Ainsworth ‘lived on 9d a week with roots boiled’. When the pastor Francis Johnson came to the church from London, where he had been in prison, Ainsworth was elected as teacher (or doctor), thanks to his knowledge of Hebrew.

Ainsworth attempted to arbitrate the quarrel between Francis and Thomasine Johnson on the one side and his brother George Johnson on the other, where George accused Thomasine of dressing immodestly and Francis of ruling the church tyrannically. Though he may initially have sympathised with George, on 15 January 1598, Ainsworth chaired a church meeting which censured him. Francis and Ainsworth also ex-communicated their elder Matthew Slade for refusing to stop going to services in the Dutch Reformed Church. Ainsworth himself caused some scandal when it emerged that he had twice submitted to the Church of England, but he was not disciplined.

Though often involved in controversy, Ainsworth was not arrogant, but was a steadfast and cultured champion of the principles represented by the early Congregationalists. Amid all the controversy, he steadily pursued his studies. The combination was so unique that some have mistaken him for two different individuals. Confusion has also been occasioned through his friendly controversy with one John Ainsworth, who left the Anglican for the Roman Catholic church.

In 1604, Johnson and Ainsworth wrote a petition for toleration of their church and took it to England in the hope of delivering it to James I. In their attempts to get it to the king, they rewrote it twice, and on their return to Amsterdam published all three versions under the title 

In 1610, Johnson changed his mind about the democratic Congregational structure of the Ancient Church, arguing that authority lay with the ministers, not the people. After nearly a year of debate, on 15 December, Ainsworth and his followers split from Johnson, and successfully sued them for possession of the church building. John Robinson tried to mediate between the two factions, but ended up taking Ainsworth&#x27;s side.

In 1620, after Johnson&#x27;s church had departed for North America, but before Robinson&#x27;s had left on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, Ainsworth&#x27;s church considered joining the latter in their journey and put some money into the project. Robert Cushman criticised the proposal, saying &#x27;Our liberty is to them as ratsbane, and their rigour as bad to us as the Spanish Inquisition.&#x27; Though nothing came of the plan, the Ainsworth church still waved the pilgrims off from Leiden.

== Personal life ==
On 29 April 1607, Ainsworth married Marjory Appelbey, a widow from Ipswich with one daughter. In 1612, the elder in the Ancient Church, Daniel Studley, was accused of ‘many lascivious attempts’ the girl, and confessed to having &#x27;clapped&#x27; her.

Henry Ainsworth died in 1622, leaving unfinished work on works on Hosea, Matthew and Hebrews.

==Works==
Ainsworth was one of the most able apologists of the so-called Brownist movement. His first solo work &quot;The communion of saincts&quot; (1607) is summarised by the historian of Separatism Stephen Tomkins as arguing &#x27;that the true church is a holy community while a church that incorporates the entire population is neither holy nor a community&#x27;. Tomkins describes his second book &quot;Covnterpoyson&quot; (1608) as &#x27;the most compelling apologia that the Separatist movement ever produced&#x27;. It was written in reply to the puritan minister John Sprint and to Richard Bernard&#x27;s &quot;The Separatist Schisme&quot;.

Ainsworth also wrote reply to John Smyth, who has been called &quot;the first Baptist&quot;, entitled &quot;Defence of Holy Scripture, Worship and Ministry used in the Christian Churches separated from Antichrist, against the Challenges, Cavils and Contradictions of Mr Smyth&quot; (1609). Of Smyth&#x27;s progression to becoming a Baptist, Ainsworth said he &#x27;had gone ‘from error to error, and now at last to the abomination of Anabaptism’, which ‘in him was the worship … of the devil’.

His scholarly works include his &quot;Annotations&quot;—on &quot;Genesis&quot; (1616); &quot;Exodus&quot; (1617); &quot;Leviticus&quot; (1618); &quot;Numbers&quot; (1619); &quot;Deuteronomy&quot; (1619); &quot;Psalms&quot; (including a metrical version, 1612); and the &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; (1623). These were collected in folio in 1627. From the outset the &quot;Annotations&quot; took a commanding place, especially among continental scholars, establishing a scholarly tradition for English nonconformity. Tomkins notes that &#x27;as late as 1866, W.S. Plumer&#x27;s commentary on Psalms cited Ainsworth as an authority more than a hundred times and the 1885 (English) Revised Version of the Bible drew on his work.&#x27;

His publication of Psalms, &quot;The Book of Psalmes: Englished both in Prose and Metre with Annotations&quot; (Amsterdam, 1612), which includes thirty-nine separate monophonic psalm tunes, constituted the Ainsworth Psalter, the only book of music brought to New England in 1620 by the Pilgrim settlers. Although its content was later reworked into the Bay Psalm Book, it had an important influence on the early development of American psalmody. An early critic of the Brownists said that ‘by the uncouth and strange translation and metre used in them, the congregation was made a laughing stock’, while the 1885 &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; said that Ainsworth ‘had not the faintest breath of poetical inspiration’.

Ainsworth died in 1622, or early in 1623, for in that year was published his &quot;Seasonable Discourse, or a Censure upon a Dialogue of the Anabaptists&quot;, in which the editor speaks of him as a departed worthy.

<text>Hindus (; ; also known as Sanātanīs) are people who religiously adhere to Hinduism, also known by its endonym Sanātana Dharma. Historically, the term has also been used as a geographical, cultural, and later religious identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent.

It is assumed that the term &quot;Hindu&quot; traces back to Avestan scripture Vendidad which refers to land of seven rivers as Hapta Hendu which itself is a cognate to Sanskrit term &quot;Sapta Sindhuḥ&quot;. (The term &quot;Sapta Sindhuḥ&quot; is mentioned in Rig Veda and refers to a North western Indian region of seven rivers and to India as a whole.) The Greek cognates of the same terms are &quot;&quot;Indus&quot; (for the river) and &quot;India&quot;&quot; (for the land of the river). Likewise the Hebrew cognate &quot;hōd-dū&quot; refers to India mentioned in Hebrew Bible (Esther 1:1). The term &quot;Hindu&quot; also implied a geographic, ethnic or cultural identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent around or beyond the Sindhu (Indus) River. By the 16th century CE, the term began to refer to residents of the subcontinent who were not Turkic or Muslims.

The historical development of Hindu self-identity within the local Indian population, in a religious or cultural sense, is unclear. Competing theories state that Hindu identity developed in the British colonial era, or that it may have developed post-8th century CE after the Muslim invasions and medieval Hindu–Muslim wars. A sense of Hindu identity and the term &quot;Hindu&quot; appears in some texts dated between the 13th and 18th century in Sanskrit and Bengali. The 14th- and 18th-century Indian poets such as Vidyapati, Kabir, Tulsidas and Eknath used the phrase &quot;Hindu dharma&quot; (Hinduism) and contrasted it with &quot;Turaka dharma&quot; (Islam). The Christian friar Sebastiao Manrique used the term &#x27;Hindu&#x27; in a religious context in 1649. In the 18th century, European merchants and colonists began to refer to the followers of Indian religions collectively as &quot;Hindus&quot;, in contrast to &quot;Mohamedans&quot; for groups such as Turks, Mughals and Arabs, who were adherents of Islam. By the mid-19th century, colonial orientalist texts further distinguished Hindus from Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains, but the colonial laws continued to consider all of them to be within the scope of the term &quot;Hindu&quot; until about the mid-20th century. Scholars state that the custom of distinguishing between Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs is a modern phenomenon.

At approximately 1.2 billion, Hindus are the world&#x27;s third-largest religious group after Christians and Muslims. The vast majority of Hindus, approximately 966 million (94.3% of the global Hindu population), live in India, according to the 2011 Indian census. After India, the next nine countries with the largest Hindu populations are, in decreasing order: Nepal, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the United States, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. These together accounted for 99% of the world&#x27;s Hindu population, and the remaining nations of the world combined had about 6 million Hindus .

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;Hindu&quot; is an exonym. This word &quot;Hindu&quot; is derived from the Indo-Aryan and Sanskrit word &quot;Sindhu&quot;, which means &quot;a large body of water&quot;, covering &quot;river, ocean&quot;. It was used as the name of the Indus River and also referred to its tributaries. The actual term &quot; first occurs, states Gavin Flood, as &quot;a Persian geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: &quot;Sindhu&quot;)&quot;, more specifically in the 5th-century BCE, DNa inscription of Darius I. The Punjab region, called Sapta Sindhu in the Vedas, is called &quot;Hapta Hindu&quot; in Zend Avesta. The 6th-century BCE inscription of Darius I mentions the province of &quot;Hi[n]dush&quot;, referring to northwestern India. The people of India were referred to as &quot;Hinduvān&quot; and &quot;hindavī&quot; was used as the adjective for Indian language in the 8th century text &quot;Chachnama&quot;. According to D. N. Jha, the term &#x27;Hindu&#x27; in these ancient records is an ethno-geographical term and did not refer to a religion.
The earliest known records of &#x27;Hindu&#x27; with connotations of religion may be in the 7th-century CE Chinese text &quot;Records on the Western Regions&quot; by the Buddhist scholar Xuanzang. Xuanzang uses the transliterated term &quot;In-tu&quot; whose &quot;connotation overflows in the religious&quot; according to Arvind Sharma. While Xuanzang suggested that the term refers to the country named after the moon, another Buddhist scholar I-tsing contradicted the conclusion saying that &quot;In-tu&quot; was not a common name for the country.

Al-Biruni&#x27;s 11th-century text &quot;Tarikh Al-Hind&quot;, and the texts of the Delhi Sultanate period use the term &#x27;Hindu&#x27;, where it includes all non-Islamic people such as Buddhists, and retains the ambiguity of being &quot;a region or a religion&quot;. The &#x27;Hindu&#x27; community occurs as the amorphous &#x27;Other&#x27; of the Muslim community in the court chronicles, according to the Indian historian Romila Thapar. The comparative religion scholar Wilfred Cantwell Smith notes that the term &#x27;Hindu&#x27; retained its geographical reference initially: &#x27;Indian&#x27;, &#x27;indigenous, local&#x27;, virtually &#x27;native&#x27;. Slowly, the Indian groups themselves started using the term, differentiating themselves and their &quot;traditional ways&quot; from those of the invaders.

The text &quot;Prithviraj Raso&quot;, by Chand Bardai, about the 1192 CE defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan at the hands of Muhammad Ghori, is full of references to &quot;Hindus&quot; and &quot;Turks&quot;, and at one stage, says &quot;both the religions have drawn their curved swords;&quot; however, the date of this text is unclear and considered by most scholars to be more recent. In Islamic literature, &#x27;Abd al-Malik Isami&#x27;s Persian work, &quot;Futuhu&#x27;s-salatin&quot;, composed in the Deccan under Bahmani rule in 1350, uses the word &quot;″&#x27; &quot; to mean Indian in the ethno-geographical sense and the word &quot;″&#x27; &quot; to mean &#x27;Hindu&#x27; in the sense of a follower of the Hindu religion&quot;. The poet Vidyapati&#x27;s &quot;Kirtilata&quot; (1380) uses the term &quot;Hindu&quot; in the sense of a religion, it contrasts the cultures of Hindus and Turks (Muslims) in a city and concludes &quot;The Hindus and the Turks live close together; Each makes fun of the other&#x27;s religion (&quot;dhamme&quot;)&quot; albeit Naqshbandi Indian sufi inhabitations in Constantinople were often attributed as &quot;Hindular Tekkesi&quot; in Ottoman Turkish.

One of the earliest uses of the word &#x27;Hindu&#x27; in a religious context, in a European language (Spanish), was in a publication in 1649 by Sebastio Manrique. In Indian historian DN Jha&#x27;s essay &quot;Looking for a Hindu identity&quot;, he writes: &quot;No Indians described themselves as Hindus before the fourteenth century&quot; and that &quot;The British borrowed the word &#x27;Hindu&#x27; from India, gave it a new meaning and significance, [and] reimported it into India as a reified phenomenon called Hinduism.&quot; In the 18th century, the European merchants and colonists began to refer to the followers of Indian religions collectively as Hindus even though in the 19th century, this term was used for Afghan-origin Muslim emperor Ibrahim Lodhi as &quot;Hindoo emperor&quot; in Encyclopædia Americana (Lieber) of 1829.

Other prominent mentions of &#x27;Hindu&#x27; include the epigraphical inscriptions from kingdoms (in present-day Andhra Pradesh) which battled military expansion of Muslim rulers in the 14th century, where the word &#x27;Hindu&#x27; partly implies a religious identity in contrast to &#x27;Turks&#x27; or Islamic religious identity. The term &quot;Hindu&quot; was later used occasionally in some Sanskrit texts such as the later Rajataranginis of Kashmir (Hinduka, ) and some 16th- to 18th-century Bengali Gaudiya Vaishnava texts, including &quot;Chaitanya Charitamrita&quot; and &quot;Chaitanya Bhagavata&quot;. These texts used it to contrast Hindus from Muslims who are called Yavanas (foreigners) or Mlecchas (barbarians), with the 16th-century &quot;Chaitanya Charitamrita&quot; text and the 17th-century &quot;Bhakta Mala&quot; text using the phrase &quot;Hindu dharma&quot;.

== Terminology ==
=== Medieval-era usage (8th to 18th century) ===
Scholar Arvind Sharma notes that the term &quot;Hindus&quot; was used in the &#x27;Brahmanabad settlement&#x27; which Muhammad ibn Qasim made with non-Muslims after the Arab invasion of northwestern Sindh region of India, in 712 CE. The term &#x27;Hindu&#x27; meant people who were non-Muslims, and it included Buddhists of the region. In the 11th-century text of Al Biruni, Hindus are referred to as &quot;religious antagonists&quot; to Islam, as those who believe in rebirth, presents them to hold a diversity of beliefs, and seems to oscillate between Hindus holding a centralist and pluralist religious views. In the texts of Delhi Sultanate era, states Sharma, the term Hindu remains ambiguous on whether it means people of a region or religion, giving the example of Ibn Battuta&#x27;s explanation of the name &quot;Hindu Kush&quot; for a mountain range in Afghanistan. It was so called, wrote Ibn Battuta, because many Indian slaves died there of freezing cold, as they were marched across the mountain range. The term &quot;Hindu&quot; there is ambivalent and could mean geographical region or religion.

The term Hindu also appears in the texts from the Mughal Empire era. Jahangir, for example, called the Sikh Guru Arjan a Hindu:

Sikh scholar Pashaura Singh states, &quot;in Persian writings, Sikhs were regarded as Hindu in the sense of non-Muslim Indians&quot;. However, scholars like Robert Fraser and Mary Hammond opine that Sikhism began initially as a militant sect of Hinduism and it got formally separated from Hinduism only in the 20th century.

=== Colonial-era usage (18th to 20th century) ===
During the colonial era, the term Hindu had connotations of native religions of India, that is religions other than Christianity and Islam. In early colonial era Anglo-Hindu laws and British India court system, the term Hindu referred to people of all Indian religions as well as two non-Indian religions: Judaism and Zoroastrianism. In the 20th century, personal laws were formulated for Hindus, and the term &#x27;Hindu&#x27; in these colonial &#x27;Hindu laws&#x27; applied to Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs in addition to denominational Hindus.

Beyond the stipulations of British colonial law, European orientalists and particularly the influential Asiatick Researches founded in the 18th century, later called The Asiatic Society, initially identified just two religions in India – Islam, and Hinduism. These orientalists included all Indian religions such as Buddhism as a subgroup of Hinduism in the 18th century. These texts termed followers of Islam as &quot;Mohamedans&quot;, and all others as &quot;Hindus&quot;. The text, by the early 19th century, began dividing Hindus into separate groups, for chronology studies of the various beliefs. Among the earliest terms to emerge were &quot;Seeks and their College&quot; (later spelled Sikhs by Charles Wilkins), &quot;Boudhism&quot; (later spelled Buddhism), and in the 9th volume of Asiatick Researches report on religions in India, the term &quot;Jainism&quot; received notice.

According to Pennington, the terms Hindu and Hinduism were thus constructed for colonial studies of India. The various sub-divisions and separation of subgroup terms were assumed to be result of &quot;communal conflict&quot;, and Hindu was constructed by these orientalists to imply people who adhered to &quot;ancient default oppressive religious substratum of India&quot;, states Pennington. Followers of other Indian religions so identified were later referred Buddhists, Sikhs or Jains and distinguished from Hindus, in an antagonistic two-dimensional manner, with Hindus and Hinduism stereotyped as irrational traditional and others as rational reform religions. However, these mid-19th-century reports offered no indication of doctrinal or ritual differences between Hindu and Buddhist, or other newly constructed religious identities. These colonial studies, states Pennigton, &quot;puzzled endlessly about the Hindus and intensely scrutinized them, but did not interrogate and avoided reporting the practices and religion of Mughal and Arabs in South Asia&quot;, and often relied on Muslim scholars to characterise Hindus.

=== Contemporary usage ===

In contemporary era, Hindus are individuals who identify with one or more aspects of Hinduism, whether they are practising or non-practicing or &quot;Laissez-faire&quot;. The term does not include those who identify with other Indian religions such as Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism or various animist tribal religions found in India such as Sarnaism. The term Hindu, in contemporary parlance, includes people who accept themselves as culturally or ethnically Hindu rather than with a fixed set of religious beliefs within Hinduism. One need not be religious in the minimal sense, states Julius Lipner, to be accepted as Hindu by Hindus, or to describe oneself as Hindu.

Hindus subscribe to a diversity of ideas on spirituality and traditions, but have no ecclesiastical order, no unquestionable religious authorities, no governing body, nor a single founding prophet; Hindus can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic or humanist. Because of the wide range of traditions and ideas covered by the term Hinduism, arriving at a comprehensive definition is difficult. The religion &quot;defies our desire to define and categorize it&quot;. A Hindu may, by his or her choice, draw upon ideas of other Indian or non-Indian religious thought as a resource, follow or evolve his or her personal beliefs, and still identify as a Hindu.

In 1995, Chief Justice P. B. Gajendragadkar was quoted in an Indian Supreme Court ruling:
:When we think of the Hindu religion, unlike other religions in the world, the Hindu religion does not claim any one prophet; it does not worship any one god; it does not subscribe to any one dogma; it does not believe in any one philosophic concept; it does not follow any one set of religious rites or performances; in fact, it does not appear to satisfy the narrow traditional features of any religion or creed. It may broadly be described as a way of life and nothing more.

Although Hinduism contains a broad range of philosophies, Hindus share philosophical concepts, such as but not limiting to dharma, karma, kama, artha, moksha and samsara, even if each subscribes to a diversity of views. Hindus also have shared texts such as the Vedas with embedded Upanishads, and common ritual grammar (Sanskara (rite of passage)) such as rituals during a wedding or when a baby is born or cremation rituals. Some Hindus go on pilgrimage to shared sites they consider spiritually significant, practice one or more forms of bhakti or puja, celebrate mythology and epics, major festivals, love and respect for guru and family, and other cultural traditions. A Hindu could:
* follow any of the Hindu schools of philosophy, such as Advaita (non-dualism), Vishishtadvaita (non-dualism of the qualified whole), Dvaita (dualism), Dvaitadvaita (dualism with non-dualism), etc.
* follow a tradition centred on any particular form of the Divine, such as Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Shaktism, etc.
* practice any one of the various forms of yoga systems in order to achieve moksha – that is freedom in current life (&quot;jivanmukti&quot;) or salvation in after-life (&quot;videhamukti&quot;);
* practice bhakti or puja for spiritual reasons, which may be directed to one&#x27;s guru or to a divine image. A visible public form of this practice is worship before an idol or statue. Jeaneane Fowler states that non-Hindu observers often confuse this practice as &quot;stone or idol-worship and nothing beyond it&quot;, while for many Hindus, it is an image which represents or is symbolic manifestation of a spiritual Absolute (Brahman). This practice may focus on a metal or stone statue, or a photographic image, or a linga, or any object or tree (pipal) or animal (cow) or tools of one&#x27;s profession, or sunrise or expression of nature or to nothing at all, and the practice may involve meditation, japa, offerings or songs. Inden states that this practice means different things to different Hindus, and has been misunderstood, misrepresented as idolatry, and various rationalisations have been constructed by both Western and native Indologists.

=== Disputes ===

In the Constitution of India, the word &quot;Hindu&quot; has been used in some places to denote persons professing any of these religions: Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism or Sikhism. This however has been challenged by the Sikhs and by neo-Buddhists who were formerly Hindus. According to Sheen and Boyle, Jains have not objected to being covered by personal laws termed under &#x27;Hindu&#x27;, but Indian courts have acknowledged that Jainism is a distinct religion.

The Republic of India is in the peculiar situation that the Supreme Court of India has repeatedly been called upon to define &quot;Hinduism&quot; because the Constitution of India, while it prohibits &quot;discrimination of any citizen&quot; on grounds of religion in article 15, article 30 foresees special rights for &quot;All minorities, whether based on religion or language&quot;. As a consequence, religious groups have an interest in being recognised as distinct from the Hindu majority in order to qualify as a &quot;religious minority&quot;. Thus, the Supreme Court was forced to consider the question whether Jainism is part of Hinduism in 2005 and 2006.

== History of Hindu identity ==
Starting after the 10th century and particularly after the 12th century Islamic invasion, states Sheldon Pollock, the political response fused with the Indic religious culture and doctrines. Temples dedicated to deity Rama were built from north to south India, and textual records as well as hagiographic inscriptions began comparing the Hindu epic of Ramayana to regional kings and their response to Islamic attacks. The Yadava king of Devagiri named &quot;Ramacandra&quot;, for example states Pollock, is described in a 13th-century record as, &quot;How is this Rama to be described.. who freed Varanasi from the &quot;mleccha&quot; (barbarian, Turk Muslim) horde, and built there a golden temple of Sarngadhara&quot;. Pollock notes that the Yadava king &quot;Ramacandra&quot; is described as a devotee of deity Shiva (Shaivism), yet his political achievements and temple construction sponsorship in Varanasi, far from his kingdom&#x27;s location in the Deccan region, is described in the historical records in Vaishnavism terms of Rama, a deity Vishnu avatar. Pollock presents many such examples and suggests an emerging Hindu political identity that was grounded in the Hindu religious text of Ramayana, one that has continued into the modern times, and suggests that this historic process began with the arrival of Islam in India.

Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya has questioned the Pollock theory and presented textual and inscriptional evidence. According to Chattopadhyaya, the Hindu identity and religious response to Islamic invasion and wars developed in different kingdoms, such as wars between Islamic Sultanates and the Vijayanagara kingdom, and Islamic raids on the kingdoms in Tamil Nadu. These wars were described not just using the mythical story of Rama from Ramayana, states Chattopadhyaya, the medieval records used a wide range of religious symbolism and myths that are now considered as part of Hindu literature. This emergence of religious with political terminology began with the first Muslim invasion of Sindh in the 8th century CE, and intensified 13th century onwards. The 14th-century Sanskrit text, &quot;Madhuravijayam&quot;, a memoir written by &quot;Gangadevi&quot;, the wife of Vijayanagara prince, for example describes the consequences of war using religious terms,

The historiographic writings in Telugu language from the 13th- and 14th-century Kakatiya dynasty period presents a similar &quot;alien other (Turk)&quot; and &quot;self-identity (Hindu)&quot; contrast. Chattopadhyaya, and other scholars, state that the military and political campaign during the medieval era wars in Deccan peninsula of India, and in the north India, were no longer a quest for sovereignty, they embodied a political and religious animosity against the &quot;otherness of Islam&quot;, and this began the historical process of Hindu identity formation.

Andrew Nicholson, in his review of scholarship on Hindu identity history, states that the vernacular literature of Bhakti movement sants from 15th to 17th century, such as Kabir, Anantadas, Eknath, Vidyapati, suggests that distinct religious identities, between Hindus and Turks (Muslims), had formed during these centuries. The poetry of this period contrasts Hindu and Islamic identities, states Nicholson, and the literature vilifies the Muslims coupled with a &quot;distinct sense of a Hindu religious identity&quot;.

=== Hindu identity amidst other Indian religions ===

Scholars state that Hindu, Buddhist and Jain identities are retrospectively-introduced modern constructions. Inscriptional evidence from the 8th century onwards, in regions such as South India, suggests that medieval era India, at both elite and folk religious practices level, likely had a &quot;shared religious culture&quot;, and their collective identities were &quot;multiple, layered and fuzzy&quot;. Even among Hinduism denominations such as Shaivism and Vaishnavism, the Hindu identities, states Leslie Orr, lacked &quot;firm definitions and clear boundaries&quot;.

Overlaps in Jain-Hindu identities have included Jains worshipping Hindu deities, intermarriages between Jains and Hindus, and medieval era Jain temples featuring Hindu religious icons and sculpture. Beyond India, on Java island of Indonesia, historical records attest to marriages between Hindus and Buddhists, medieval era temple architecture and sculptures that simultaneously incorporate Hindu and Buddhist themes, where Hinduism and Buddhism merged and functioned as &quot;two separate paths within one overall system&quot;, according to Ann Kenney and other scholars. Similarly, there is an organic relation of Sikhs to Hindus, states Zaehner, both in religious thought and their communities, and virtually all Sikhs&#x27; ancestors were Hindus. Marriages between Sikhs and Hindus, particularly among &quot;Khatris&quot;, were frequent. Some Hindu families brought up a son as a Sikh, and some Hindus view Sikhism as a tradition within Hinduism, even though the Sikh faith is a distinct religion.

Julius Lipner states that the custom of distinguishing between Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs is a modern phenomena, but one that is a convenient abstraction. Distinguishing Indian traditions is a fairly recent practice, states Lipner, and is the result of &quot;not only Western preconceptions about the nature of religion in general and of religion in India in particular, but also with the political awareness that has arisen in India&quot; in its people and a result of Western influence during its colonial history.

=== Sacred geography ===
Scholars such as Fleming and Eck state that the post-Epic era literature from the 1st millennium CE amply demonstrate that there was a historic concept of the Indian subcontinent as a sacred geography, where the sacredness was a shared set of religious ideas. For example, the twelve &quot;Jyotirlingas&quot; of Shaivism and fifty-one &quot;Shaktipithas&quot; of Shaktism are described in the early medieval era Puranas as pilgrimage sites around a theme. This sacred geography and Shaiva temples with same iconography, shared themes, motifs and embedded legends are found across India, from the Himalayas to hills of South India, from Ellora Caves to Varanasi by about the middle of 1st millennium. Shakti temples, dated to a few centuries later, are verifiable across the subcontinent. Varanasi as a sacred pilgrimage site is documented in the &quot;Varanasimahatmya&quot; text embedded inside the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, and the oldest versions of this text are dated to 6th to 8th-century CE.

The idea of twelve sacred sites in Shiva Hindu tradition spread across the Indian subcontinent appears not only in the medieval era temples but also in copper plate inscriptions and temple seals discovered in different sites. According to Bhardwaj, non-Hindu texts such as the memoirs of Chinese Buddhist and Persian Muslim travellers attest to the existence and significance of the pilgrimage to sacred geography among Hindus by later 1st millennium CE.

According to Fleming, those who question whether the term Hindu and Hinduism are a modern construction in a religious context present their arguments based on some texts that have survived into the modern era, either of Islamic courts or of literature published by Western missionaries or colonial-era Indologists aiming for a reasonable construction of history. However, the existence of non-textual evidence such as cave temples separated by thousands of kilometers, as well as lists of medieval era pilgrimage sites, is evidence of a shared sacred geography and existence of a community that was self-aware of shared religious premises and landscape. Further, it is a norm in evolving cultures that there is a gap between the &quot;lived and historical realities&quot; of a religious tradition and the emergence of related &quot;textual authorities&quot;. The tradition and temples likely existed well before the medieval era Hindu manuscripts appeared that describe them and the sacred geography. This, states Fleming, is apparent given the sophistication of the architecture and the sacred sites along with the variance in the versions of the Puranic literature. According to Diana L. Eck and other Indologists such as André Wink, Muslim invaders were aware of Hindu sacred geography such as Mathura, Ujjain, and Varanasi by the 11th century. These sites became a target of their serial attacks in the centuries that followed.

=== Hindu persecution ===

The Hindus have been persecuted during the medieval and modern era. The medieval persecution included waves of plunder, killing, destruction of temples and enslavement by Turk-Mongol Muslim armies from central Asia. This is documented in Islamic literature such as those relating to 8th century Muhammad bin-Qasim, 11th century Mahmud of Ghazni, the Persian traveler Al Biruni, the 14th century Islamic army invasion led by Timur, and various Sunni Islamic rulers of the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire. There were occasional exceptions such as Akbar who stopped the persecution of Hindus, and occasional severe persecution such as under Aurangzeb, who destroyed temples, forcibly converted non-Muslims to Islam and banned the celebration of Hindu festivals such as Holi and Diwali.

Other recorded persecution of Hindus include those under the reign of 18th century Tipu Sultan in south India, and during the colonial era. In the modern era, religious persecution of Hindus have been reported outside India in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar.

=== Hindu nationalism ===

Christophe Jaffrelot states that modern Hindu nationalism was born in Maharashtra, in the 1920s, as a reaction to the Islamic Khilafat Movement wherein Indian Muslims championed and took the cause of the Turkish Ottoman sultan as the Caliph of all Muslims, at the end of the World War I. Hindus viewed this development as one of divided loyalties of Indian Muslim population, of pan-Islamic hegemony, and questioned whether Indian Muslims were a part of an inclusive anti-colonial Indian nationalism. The Hindu nationalism ideology that emerged, states Jeffrelot, was codified by Savarkar while he was a political prisoner of the British colonial authorities.

Chris Bayly traces the roots of Hindu nationalism to the Hindu identity and political independence achieved by the Maratha confederacy, that overthrew the Islamic Mughal empire in large parts of India, allowing Hindus the freedom to pursue any of their diverse religious beliefs and restored Hindu holy places such as Varanasi. A few scholars view Hindu mobilisation and consequent nationalism to have emerged in the 19th century as a response to British colonialism by Indian nationalists and neo-Hinduism gurus. Jaffrelot states that the efforts of Christian missionaries and Islamic proselytizers, during the British colonial era, each of whom tried to gain new converts to their own religion, by stereotyping and stigmatising Hindus to an identity of being inferior and superstitious, contributed to Hindus re-asserting their spiritual heritage and counter cross examining Islam and Christianity, forming organisations such as the &quot;Hindu Sabhas&quot; (Hindu associations), and ultimately a Hindu-identity driven nationalism in the 1920s.

The colonial era Hindu revivalism and mobilisation, along with Hindu nationalism, states Peter van der Veer, was primarily a reaction to and competition with Muslim separatism and Muslim nationalism. The successes of each side fed the fears of the other, leading to the growth of Hindu nationalism and Muslim nationalism in the Indian subcontinent. In the 20th century, the sense of religious nationalism grew in India, states van der Veer, but only Muslim nationalism succeeded with the formation of the West and East Pakistan (later split into Pakistan and Bangladesh), as &quot;an Islamic state&quot; upon independence. Religious riots and social trauma followed as millions of Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs moved out of the newly created Islamic states and resettled into the Hindu-majority post-British India. After the separation of India and Pakistan in 1947, the Hindu nationalism movement developed the concept of Hindutva in second half of the 20th century.

The Hindu nationalism movement has sought to reform Indian laws, that critics say attempts to impose Hindu values on India&#x27;s Islamic minority. Gerald Larson states, for example, that Hindu nationalists have sought a uniform civil code, where all citizens are subject to the same laws, everyone has equal civil rights, and individual rights do not depend on the individual&#x27;s religion. In contrast, opponents of Hindu nationalists remark that eliminating religious law from India poses a threat to the cultural identity and religious rights of Muslims, and people of Islamic faith have a constitutional right to Islamic shariah-based personal laws. A specific law, contentious between Hindu nationalists and their opponents in India, relates to the legal age of marriage for girls. Hindu nationalists seek that the legal age for marriage be eighteen that is universally applied to all girls regardless of their religion and that marriages be registered with local government to verify the age of marriage. Muslim clerics consider this proposal as unacceptable because under the shariah-derived personal law, a Muslim girl can be married at any age after she reaches puberty.

Hindu nationalism in India, states Katharine Adeney, is a controversial political subject, with no consensus about what it means or implies in terms of the form of government and religious rights of the minorities.

== Demographics ==
There are 1.2 billion Hindus worldwide (15% of world&#x27;s population), with about 95% of them being concentrated in India alone. Along with Christians (31.5%), Muslims (23.2%) and Buddhists (7.1%), Hindus are one of the four major religious groups of the world.

Most Hindus are found in Asian countries. The top twenty-five countries with the most Hindu residents and citizens (in decreasing order) are India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, United States, Malaysia, Myanmar, United Kingdom, Mauritius, South Africa, United Arab Emirates, Canada, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad and Tobago, Singapore, Fiji, Qatar, Kuwait, Guyana, Bhutan, Oman and Yemen.

The top fifteen countries with the highest percentage of Hindus (in decreasing order) are Nepal, India, Mauritius, Fiji, Guyana, Bhutan, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Qatar, Sri Lanka, Kuwait, Bangladesh, Réunion, Malaysia, and Singapore.

The fertility rate, that is children per woman, for Hindus is 2.4, which is less than the world average of 2.5. Pew Research projects that there will be 1.4 billion Hindus by 2050.
In more ancient times, Hindu kingdoms arose and spread the religion and traditions across Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Nepal, Burma, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Philippines, and what is now central Vietnam.

Over 3 million Hindus are found in Bali Indonesia, a culture whose origins trace back to ideas brought by Hindu traders to Indonesian islands in the 1st millennium CE. Their sacred texts are also the Vedas and the Upanishads. The Puranas and the Itihasa (mainly &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;) are enduring traditions among Indonesian Hindus, expressed in community dances and shadow puppet (&quot;wayang&quot;) performances. As in India, Indonesian Hindus recognise four paths of spirituality, calling it &quot;Catur Marga&quot;. Similarly, like Hindus in India, Balinese Hindus believe that there are four proper goals of human life, calling it &quot;Catur Purusartha&quot; – dharma (pursuit of moral and ethical living), artha (pursuit of wealth and creative activity), kama (pursuit of joy and love) and moksha (pursuit of self-knowledge and liberation).

== Culture ==

Hindu culture is a term used to describe the culture and identity of Hindus and Hinduism, including the historic Vedic people. Hindu culture can be intensively seen in the form of art, architecture, history, diet, clothing, astrology and other forms. The culture of India and Hinduism is deeply influenced and assimilated with each other. With the Indianisation of southeast Asia and Greater India, the culture has also influenced a long region and other religions people of that area. All Indian religions, including Buddhism,
Jainism and Sikhism are deeply influenced and soft-powered by Hinduism.

<text>Hernando de Alarcón (born 1500) was a Spanish explorer and navigator of the 16th century, noted for having led a 1540 expedition to the Colorado River Delta, during which he became one of the first Europeans to ascend the Colorado River from its mouth and became the first European to see Alta California.

Little is known about Alarcón&#x27;s life outside of his exploits in New Spain. He was probably born in the town of Trujillo, in present-day Extremadura, Spain, in the first years of the 16th century and travelled to the Spanish colonies in the Americas as a young man.

==1540 expedition==
By 1540, Mexico had been conquered and state-sponsored expeditions were being sent north in search of new wealth and the existence of a water passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Viceroy of New Spain Antonio de Mendoza commissioned Francisco Vázquez de Coronado to undertake a massive overland expedition to find the Seven Cities of Cibola, which were rumoured to exist in the unexplored northern interior. The expedition was to be resupplied with stores and provisions delivered by ships traveling north up the Sea of Cortés (Gulf of California), the commander of which would be Alarcón.

Alarcón set sail from the Pacific port of Acapulco with two ships, the &quot;San Pedro&quot; and the &quot;Santa Catalina&quot;, on May 9, 1540, and was later joined by the &quot;San Gabriel&quot; at St. Jago de Buena Esperanza (modern-day Manzanillo, Colima). His orders from Mendoza were to await the arrival of Coronado&#x27;s land expedition at a certain latitude along the coast. The meeting with Coronado was never effected, though Alarcón reached the appointed place and left letters, which were soon afterward discovered by Melchor Díaz, another explorer.

Alarcón eventually sailed to the northern terminus of the Gulf of California and completed the explorations begun by Francisco de Ulloa the preceding year. During this voyage Alarcón proved to his satisfaction that no open-water passage existed between the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean (then called the &quot;South Sea&quot;). Subsequently, on September 26, he entered the mouth of the Colorado River, which he named the &quot;Buena Guía&quot; (&quot;good guide&quot;). He was the first European to ascend the river for a distance considerable enough to make important observations. On a second voyage, he probably proceeded past the present-day site of Yuma, Arizona. A map drawn by one of Alarcón&#x27;s pilots is the earliest accurately detailed representation of the Gulf of California and the lower course of the Colorado River.

Alarcón is unusual among 16th-century &quot;conquistadores&quot; for his reportedly humane treatment of the Indians he met, as opposed to the often reckless and cruel behavior known from accounts of his contemporaries. Bernard de Voto, in his 1953 &quot;Westward the Course of Empire&quot;, observed: &quot;The Indians had an experience they were never to repeat: they were sorry to see these white men leave.&quot; Alarcón wrote of his contact with the Yuma-speaking Indians along Colorado. The information he compiled consisted of their practices in warfare, religion, curing, and even sexual customs.

California Historical Landmark No. 568, on the west bank of the Colorado River near Andrade in Imperial County, California, commemorates Alarcón&#x27;s expedition had been the first non-Indians to sight land within the present-day state of California.

==California Historical Landmark==
California Historical Landmark number 568 reads:

:&quot;NO. 568 HERNANDO DE ALARCÓN EXPEDITION - Alarcón&#x27;s mission was to provide supplies for Francisco Coronado&#x27;s expedition in search of the fabled Seven Cities of Cibola. The Spaniards led by Hernando de Alarcón ascended the Colorado River by boat from the Gulf of California past this point, thereby becoming the first non-Indians to sight Alta California on September 5, 1540.&quot;

<text>Hakka cuisine is the cooking style of the Hakka people, and it may also be found in parts of Taiwan and in countries with significant overseas Hakka communities. There are many restaurants in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, as well as in the United States and Canada, that serve Hakka food. Hakka cuisine was listed in 2014 on the first Hong Kong Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage.

== Background ==
The Hakka people have a marked cuisine and style of Chinese cooking which is little known outside the Hakka home. It concentrates on the texture of food – the hallmark of Hakka cuisine. Whereas preserved meats feature in Hakka delicacy, stewed, braised, roast meats – &#x27;texturized&#x27; contributions to the Hakka palate – have a central place in their repertoire. Preserved vegetables () are commonly used for steamed and braised dishes such as steamed minced pork with preserved vegetables and braised pork with salted vegetables. In fact, the raw materials for Hakka food are no different from raw materials for any other type of regional Chinese cuisine where what is cooked depends on what is available in the market. Hakka cuisine may be described as outwardly simple but tasty. The skill in Hakka cuisine lies in the ability to cook meat thoroughly without hardening it, and to naturally bring out the proteinous flavor (umami taste) of meat.

The Hakka who settled in the harbor and port areas of Hong Kong placed great emphasis on seafood cuisine. Hakka cuisine in Hong Kong is less dominated by expensive meats; instead, emphasis is placed on an abundance of vegetables. Pragmatic and simple, Hakka cuisine is garnished lightly with sparse or little flavoring. Modern Hakka cooking in Hong Kong favors offal, an example being deep-fried intestines (). Others include tofu with preservatives, along with their signature dish, salt baked chicken (). Another specialty is the poon choi (). While it may be difficult to prove these were the actual diets of the old Hakka community, it is at present a commonly accepted view. The above dishes and their variations are in fact found and consumed throughout China, including Guangdong Province, and are not particularly unique or confined to the Hakka population.

Besides meat as source of protein, there is a unique vegan dish called lei cha (). It comprises combinations of vegetables and beans. Although not specifically unique for all Hakka people but are definitely famous among the Hakka-Hopo families. This vegetable-based rice tea dish is gaining momentum in some multicultural countries like Malaysia. Cooking of this dish requires the help from other family members to complete all eight combinations. It helps foster the relationship between family members in return.

Steamed bun () is a popular snack among the Hakka people, especially pork belly bao (扣肉包) that is stuffed with kiu nyuk. This bun is usually made with flour, water, sugar, and yeast, resulting in a soft, fluffy texture when steamed. There is another variety available, such as a dumpling-like bun called tea fruit (茶果), made from glutinous rice. The sweet version is filled with sweetened black-eyed pea paste or peanuts, while the salty version contains preserved vegetables or radishes.

==Notable dishes==
Hakka food also includes other traditional Taiwanese dishes, just as other Taiwanese ethnic groups do. Some of the more notable dishes in Hakka cuisine are listed as follow:

==Hakka cuisine in South Asia==

In India, Pakistan and other South Asian countries, there is something locally known &quot;Hakka cuisine.&quot; This variation of Chinese-style cuisine is, in reality, mostly Indian Chinese cuisine and Pakistani Chinese cuisine. It is called &quot;Hakka cuisine&quot; because, in India and areas of Pakistan, many owners of restaurants who serve this cuisine are of Hakka origin. Typical dishes include &#x27;chilli chicken&#x27; and &#x27;Dongbei (northeastern) chow mein/hakka noodles&#x27; (an Indian version of real Northeastern Chinese cuisine), and these restaurants also serve traditional South Asian dishes such as pakora. Being very popular in these areas, this style of cuisine is often mistakenly credited as being representative of Hakka cuisine in general, whereas the authentic style of Hakka cuisine is rarely known in these regions.

Outside of South Asia, the premier place to enjoy Indian-Pakistani-Chinese cuisine is in Toronto, Canada, due to most of it being halal. In Toronto, &quot;Hakka Chinese food&quot; almost universally refers to Indian-Chinese cuisine, not Hakka cuisine in general.

==Hakka cuisine in Thailand==
In Thailand, Bangkok&#x27;s Chinatown is Yaowarat and including neighboring areas such as Sampheng, Charoen Chai, Charoen Krung, Suan Mali, Phlapphla Chai or Wong Wian Yi Sip Song Karakadakhom (July 22 Circle). In the past, many Hakka restaurants are located in the Suan Mali near Bangkok Metropolitan Administration General Hospital. But now they had moved into many places, such as Talad Phlu, which is also one of the Chinatown as well.

<text>Hunan cuisine, also known as Xiang cuisine, consists of the cuisines of the Xiang River region, Dongting Lake and western Hunan Province in China. It is one of the Eight Great Traditions of Chinese cuisine and is well known for its hot and spicy flavours, fresh aroma and deep colours. Despite this, only about 20% of the cuisine uses capsicum to produce a strong spicy taste. Common cooking techniques include stewing, frying, pot-roasting, braising and smoking. Due to the high agricultural output of the region, ingredients for Hunan dishes are many and varied.

==History==
The history of the cooking skills employed in Hunan cuisine dates back to the 17th century. The first mention of chili peppers in local gazettes in the province date to 1684, 21st year of the Kangxi Emperor. During the course of its history, Hunan cuisine assimilated a variety of local forms, eventually evolving into its own style. Some well-known dishes include fried chicken with Sichuan spicy sauce () and smoked pork with dried long green beans ().

Hunan cuisine consists of three primary styles:
* Xiang River style: Originating from Changsha, Xiangtan and Hengyang. The dishes are quite oily with a attractive colour, and the dishes are spicy, fresh, and have a strong aroma. Dishes include Stir-fry chicken with Chili, Braised Meat with Black Bean Sauce and Changsha Stinky Tofu.
* Dongting Lake style: Originating from Yueyang, Yiyang and Changde. This style is also oily but is also starchy, accompanied with spiciness and saltiness. Stewing is more common in this form of Hunan cuisine, and fish is commonly used too. Notable dishes include Dongting Gold Tortoise and Lotus Seedpod with Crystal Sugar.
* Western Hunan style: Originating from Zhangjiajie, Jishou and Huaihua. Preserved meats and pickled vegetables are more commonly used. The taste is influenced by the ethnic minorities in the region, which results in a sour, spicy, and salty taste. Notable dishes include braised mushrooms and Xiangxi Sour Meat.
== Features ==

With its liberal use of chili peppers, shallots and garlic, Hunan cuisine is known for being &quot;gan la&quot; () or purely hot, as opposed to Sichuan cuisine, to which it is often compared. Sichuan cuisine uses its distinctive &quot;ma la&quot; () seasoning and other complex flavour combinations, frequently employs Sichuan pepper along with chilies which are often dried. It also utilises more dried or preserved ingredients and condiments. Hunan cuisine, on the other hand, is often spicier by pure chili content and contains a larger variety of fresh ingredients. Both Hunan and Sichuan cuisine are perhaps significantly oilier than the other cuisines in China, but Sichuan dishes are generally oilier than Hunan dishes. Another characteristic distinguishing Hunan cuisine from Sichuan cuisine is that Hunan cuisine uses smoked and cured goods in its dishes much more frequently.
Hunan cuisine&#x27;s menu changes with the seasons. In a hot and humid summer, a meal will usually start with cold dishes or a platter holding a selection of cold meats with chilies for opening the pores and keeping cool in the summer. In winter, a popular choice is hot pot, thought to heat the blood in the cold months. A special hot pot called &quot;yuanyang huoguo&quot; () is notable for splitting the pot into a spicy and a mild side. One of the classic dishes in Hunan cuisine served in restaurants and at home is farmer pepper fried pork. It is made with several common ingredients: pork belly, green pepper, fermented black beans and other spices.

== List of notable dishes ==


A discussion of Hunan cuisine overall may list a number of piquant dishes, usually but not always very hot and spicy.

<doc id="13681" wikidata="Q185565" url="?curid=13681" title="Hyperinflation">
<text>In economics, hyperinflation is a very high and typically accelerating inflation. It quickly erodes the real value of the local currency, as the prices of all goods increase. This causes people to minimize their holdings in that currency as they usually switch to more stable foreign currencies. Effective capital controls and currency substitution (&quot;dollarization&quot;) are the orthodox solutions to ending short-term hyperinflation; however there are significant social and economic costs to these policies. Ineffective implementations of these solutions often exacerbate the situation. Many governments choose to attempt to solve structural issues without resorting to those solutions, with the goal of bringing inflation down slowly while minimizing social costs of further economic shocks.

Unlike low inflation, where the process of rising prices is protracted and not generally noticeable except by studying past market prices, hyperinflation sees a rapid and continuing increase in nominal prices, the nominal cost of goods, and in the supply of currency. Typically, however, the general price level rises even more rapidly than the money supply as people try ridding themselves of the devaluing currency as quickly as possible. As this happens, the real stock of money (i.e., the amount of circulating money divided by the price level) decreases considerably.

Hyperinflation is often associated with some stress to the government budget, such as wars or their aftermath, sociopolitical upheavals, a collapse in aggregate supply or one in export prices, or other crises that make it difficult for the government to collect tax revenue. A sharp decrease in real tax revenue coupled with a strong need to maintain government spending, together with an inability or unwillingness to borrow, can lead a country into hyperinflation.

==Definition==

In 1956, Columbia University economics professor Phillip Cagan wrote &quot;The Monetary Dynamics of Hyperinflation&quot;, often regarded as the first serious study of hyperinflation and its effects (though &quot;The Economics of Inflation&quot; by C. Bresciani-Turroni on the German hyperinflation was published in Italian in 1931). In this work, Cagan defined a hyperinflationary episode as starting in the month that the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%, and as ending when the monthly inflation rate drops below 50% and stays that way for at least a year. Economists usually follow Cagan&#x27;s description that hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50% (accumulating to a yearly increase of 12,874.63%, or an increase by a factor of 129.7463).

The International Accounting Standards Board has issued guidance on accounting rules in a hyperinflationary environment. It does not establish an absolute rule on when hyperinflation arises, but instead lists factors that indicate the existence of hyperinflation:
* The general population prefers to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency. Amounts of local currency held are immediately invested to maintain purchasing power;
* The general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the local currency but in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency. Prices may be quoted in that currency;
* Sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power during the credit period, even if the period is short;
* Interest rates, wages, and prices are linked to a price index; and
* The cumulative inflation rate over three years approaches, or exceeds, 100%.

==Causes==
While there can be a number of causes of high inflation, almost all hyperinflations have been caused by government budget deficits financed by currency creation. Peter Bernholz analysed 29 hyperinflations (following Cagan&#x27;s definition) and concludes that at least 25 of them have been caused in this way. A necessary condition for hyperinflation is the use of paper money instead of gold or silver coins. Most hyperinflations in history, with some exceptions, such as the French hyperinflation of 1789–1796, occurred after the use of fiat currency became widespread in the late 19th century. The French hyperinflation took place after the introduction of a non-convertible paper currency, the assignat.

===Money supply===
Monetarist theories hold that hyperinflation occurs when there is a continuing (and often accelerating) rapid increase in the amount of money that is not supported by a corresponding growth in the output of goods and services.

The increases in price that can result from rapid money creation can create a vicious circle, requiring ever growing amounts of new money creation to fund government deficits. Hence both monetary inflation and price inflation proceed at a rapid pace. Such rapidly increasing prices cause widespread unwillingness of the local population to hold the local currency as it rapidly loses its buying power. Instead, they quickly spend any money they receive, which increases the velocity of money flow; this in turn causes further acceleration in prices. This means that the increase in the price level is greater than that of the money supply.

This results in an imbalance between the supply and demand for the money (including currency and bank deposits), causing rapid inflation. Very high inflation rates can result in a loss of confidence in the currency, similar to a bank run. The excessive money supply growth can result from speculating by private borrowers, or may result from the government being either unable or unwilling to fully finance the government budget through taxation or borrowing. The government may instead finance a government deficit through the creation of money.

Governments have sometimes resorted to excessively loose monetary policy, as it allows a government to devalue its debts and reduce (or avoid) tax increases. Monetary inflation is effectively a flat tax on creditors that also redistributes proportionally to private debtors. Distributional effects of monetary inflation are complex and vary based on the situation, with some models finding regressive effects but other empirical studies progressive effects. As a form of tax, it is less overt than levied taxes and is therefore harder to understand by ordinary citizens. Inflation can obscure quantitative assessments of the true cost of living, as published price indices only look at data in retrospect, so may increase only months later. Monetary inflation can become hyperinflation if monetary authorities fail to fund increasing government expenses from taxes, government debt, cost cutting, or by other means, because either

* during the time between recording or levying taxable transactions and collecting the taxes due, the value of the taxes collected falls in real value to a small fraction of the original taxes receivable; or
* government debt issues fail to find buyers except at very deep discounts; or
* a combination of the above.

Theories of hyperinflation generally look for a relationship between seigniorage and the inflation tax. In both Cagan&#x27;s model and the neo-classical models, a tipping point occurs when the increase in money supply or the drop in the monetary base makes it impossible for a government to improve its financial position. Thus when fiat money is printed, government obligations that are not denominated in money increase in cost by more than the value of the money created.

In neo-classical economic theory, hyperinflation is rooted in a deterioration of the monetary base, that is the confidence that there is a store of value that the currency will be able to command later. In this model, the perceived risk of holding currency rises dramatically, and sellers demand increasingly high premiums to accept the currency. This in turn leads to a greater fear that the currency will collapse, causing even higher premiums. One example of this is during periods of warfare, civil war, or intense internal conflict of other kinds: governments need to do whatever is necessary to continue fighting, since the alternative is defeat. Expenses cannot be cut significantly since the main outlay is armaments. Further, a civil war may make it difficult to raise taxes or to collect existing taxes. While in peacetime the deficit is financed by selling bonds, during a war it is typically difficult and expensive to borrow, especially if the war is going poorly for the government in question. The banking authorities, whether central or not, &quot;monetize&quot; the deficit, printing money to pay for the government&#x27;s efforts to survive. The hyperinflation under the Chinese Nationalists from 1939 to 1945 is a classic example of a government printing money to pay civil war costs. By the end, currency was flown in over the Himalayas, and then old currency was flown out to be destroyed.

Hyperinflation is a complex phenomenon and one explanation may not be applicable to all cases. In both of these models, however, whether loss of confidence comes first, or central bank seigniorage, the other phase is ignited. In the case of rapid expansion of the money supply, prices rise rapidly in response to the increased supply of money relative to the supply of goods and services, and in the case of loss of confidence, the monetary authority responds to the risk premiums it has to pay by &quot;running the printing presses&quot;.

===Supply shocks===
A number of hyperinflations were caused by some sort of extreme negative supply shock, sometimes but not always associated with wars or natural disasters.

==Effects==
Hyperinflation increases stock market prices, wipes out the purchasing power of private and public savings, distorts the economy in favor of the hoarding of real assets, causes the monetary base (whether specie or hard currency) to flee the country, and makes the afflicted area anathema to investment.

One of the most important characteristics of hyperinflation is the accelerating substitution of the inflating money by stable money—gold and silver in former times, then relatively stable foreign currencies after the breakdown of the gold or silver standards (Thiers&#x27; law). If inflation is high enough, government regulations like heavy penalties and fines, often combined with exchange controls, cannot prevent this currency substitution. As a consequence, the inflating currency is usually heavily undervalued compared to stable foreign money in terms of purchasing power parity. So foreigners can live cheaply and buy at low prices in the countries hit by high inflation. It follows that governments that do not succeed in engineering a successful currency reform in time must finally legalize the stable foreign currencies (or, formerly, gold and silver) that threaten to fully substitute the inflating money. Otherwise, their tax revenues, including the inflation tax, will approach zero. The last episode of hyperinflation in which this process could be observed was in Zimbabwe in the first decade of the 21st century. In this case, the local money was mainly driven out by the US dollar and the South African rand.

Enactment of price controls to prevent discounting the value of paper money relative to gold, silver, hard currency, or other commodities fail to force acceptance of a paper money that lacks intrinsic value. If the entity responsible for printing a currency promotes excessive money printing, with other factors contributing a reinforcing effect, hyperinflation usually continues. Hyperinflation is generally associated with paper money, which can easily be used to increase the money supply: add more zeros to the plates and print, or even stamp old notes with new numbers.

Much attention on hyperinflation centers on the effect on savers whose investments become worthless. Interest rate changes often cannot keep up with hyperinflation or even high inflation, certainly with contractually fixed interest rates. For example, in the 1970s in the United Kingdom inflation reached 25% per annum, yet interest rates did not rise above 15%—and then only briefly—and many fixed interest rate loans existed. Contractually, there is often no bar to a debtor clearing his long term debt with &quot;hyperinflated cash&quot;, nor could a lender simply somehow suspend the loan. Contractual &quot;early redemption penalties&quot; were (and still are) often based on a penalty of &quot;n&quot; months of interest/payment; again no real bar to paying off what had been a large loan. In interwar Germany, for example, much private and corporate debt was effectively wiped out—certainly for those holding fixed interest rate loans.

As more and more money is provided, interest rates decline towards zero. Realizing that fiat money is losing value, investors will try to place money in assets such as real estate, stocks, even art; as these appear to represent &quot;real&quot; value. Asset prices are thus becoming inflated. This potentially spiraling process will ultimately lead to the collapse of the monetary system. The Cantillon effect says that those institutions that receive the new money first are the beneficiaries of the policy.

===Aftermath===
Hyperinflation is ended by drastic remedies, such as imposing the shock therapy of slashing government expenditures or altering the currency basis. One form this may take is dollarization, the use of a foreign currency (not necessarily the U.S. dollar) as a national unit of currency. An example was dollarization in Ecuador, initiated in September 2000 in response to a 75% loss of value of the Ecuadorian sucre in early 2000. Usually the &quot;dollarization&quot; takes place in spite of all efforts of the government to prevent it by exchange controls, heavy fines and penalties. The government has thus to try to engineer a successful currency reform stabilizing the value of the money. If it does not succeed with this reform the substitution of the inflating by stable money goes on. Thus it is not surprising that there have been at least seven historical cases in which the good (foreign) money did fully drive out the use of the inflating currency. In the end, the government had to legalize the former, for otherwise its revenues would have fallen to zero.

Hyperinflation has always been a traumatic experience for the people who suffer it, and the next political regime almost always enacts policies to try to prevent its recurrence. Often this means making the central bank very aggressive about maintaining price stability, as was the case with the German Bundesbank, or moving to some hard basis of currency, such as a currency board. Many governments have enacted extremely stiff wage and price controls in the wake of hyperinflation, but this does not prevent further inflation of the money supply by the central bank, and always leads to widespread shortages of consumer goods if the controls are rigidly enforced.

===Currency===
In countries experiencing hyperinflation, the central bank often prints money in larger and larger denominations as the smaller denomination notes become worthless. This can result in the production of unusually large denominations of banknotes, including those denominated in amounts of 1,000,000,000 (10, 1 billion) or more.
* By late 1923, the Weimar Republic of Germany was issuing two-trillion mark banknotes and postage stamps with a face value of fifty billion marks. The highest value banknote issued by the Weimar government&#x27;s Reichsbank had a face value of 100 trillion marks (10; 100,000,000,000,000; 100 million million). At the height of the inflation, one US dollar was worth 4 trillion German marks. One of the firms printing these notes submitted an invoice for the work to the Reichsbank for 32,776,899,763,734,490,417.05 (3.28 × 10, roughly 33 quintillion) marks.
* The largest denomination banknote ever officially issued for circulation was in 1946 by the Hungarian National Bank for the amount of 100 quintillion pengő (10; 100,000,000,000,000,000,000; 100 million million million). (A banknote worth 10 times as much, 10 (1 sextillion) pengő, was printed but not issued.) The banknotes did not show the numbers in full: &quot;hundred million b.-pengő&quot; (&quot;hundred million trillion pengő&quot;) and &quot;one milliard b.-pengő&quot; were spelled out instead. This makes the 100,000,000,000,000 Zimbabwean dollar banknotes the note with the greatest number of zeros shown.
* The Post-World War II hyperinflation of Hungary held the record for the most extreme monthly inflation rate ever – 41.9 quadrillion percent (%; 41,900,000,000,000,000%) for July 1946, amounting to prices doubling every 15.3 hours. By comparison, on 14 November 2008, Zimbabwe&#x27;s annual inflation rate was estimated to be 89.7 sextillion (10) percent. The highest monthly inflation rate of that period was 79.6 billion percent (%; 79,600,000,000%), and a doubling time of 24.7 hours.

One way to avoid the use of large numbers is by declaring a new unit of currency. (As an example, instead of 10,000,000,000 dollars, a central bank might set 1 new dollar = 1,000,000,000 old dollars, so the new note would read &quot;10 new dollars&quot;.) One example of this is Turkey&#x27;s revaluation of the lira on 1 January 2005, when the old Turkish lira (TRL) was converted to the new Turkish lira (TRY) at a rate of 1,000,000 old to 1 new lira. While this does not lessen the actual value of a currency, it is called redenomination or revaluation and also occasionally happens in countries with lower inflation rates. During hyperinflation, currency inflation happens so quickly that bills reach large numbers before revaluation.

Governments may try to disguise the true rate of inflation through a variety of techniques. If these actions do not address the root causes of inflation they may undermine trust in the currency, causing further increases in inflation. Price controls will generally result in shortages and hoarding and extremely high demand for the controlled goods, causing disruptions of supply chains. Products available to consumers may diminish or disappear as businesses no longer find it economic to continue producing and/or distributing such goods at the legal prices, further exacerbating the shortages.

There are also issues with computerized money-handling systems. In Zimbabwe, during the hyperinflation of the Zimbabwe dollar, many automated teller machines and payment card machines struggled with arithmetic overflow errors as customers required many billions and trillions of dollars at one time.

===Austria===

In 1922, inflation in Austria reached 1,426%, and from 1914 to January 1923, the consumer price index rose by a factor of 11,836, with the highest banknote in denominations of 500,000 Kronen. After World War I, essentially all State enterprises ran at a loss, and the number of state employees in the capital, Vienna, was greater than in the earlier monarchy, even though the new republic was nearly one-eighth of the size.

Observing the Austrian response to developing hyperinflation, which included the hoarding of food and the speculation in foreign currencies, Owen S. Phillpotts, the Commercial Secretary at the British Legation in Vienna wrote: &quot;The Austrians are like men on a ship who cannot manage it, and are continually signalling for help. While waiting, however, most of them begin to cut rafts, each for himself, out of the sides and decks. The ship has not yet sunk despite the leaks so caused, and those who have acquired stores of wood in this way may use them to cook their food, while the more seamanlike look on cold and hungry. The population lack courage and energy as well as patriotism.&quot;

=== Bolivia ===
Increasing hyperinflation in Bolivia has plagued, and at times crippled, its economy and currency since the 1970s. At one time in 1985, the country experienced an annual inflation rate of more than 20,000%. Fiscal and monetary reform reduced the inflation rate to single digits by the 1990s, and in 2004 Bolivia experienced a manageable 4.9% rate of inflation.

In 1987, the peso boliviano was replaced by the new boliviano at a rate of one million to one (when 1 US dollar was worth 1.8–1.9 million pesos bolivianos). At that time, 1 new boliviano was roughly equivalent to 52 U.S. cents.

=== Brazil ===
Brazilian hyperinflation lasted from 1985 (the year when the military dictatorship ended) to 1994, with prices rising by 184,901,570,954.39% (or percent; equivalent to a tenfold increase on average a year) in that time due to the uncontrolled printing of money. There were many economic plans that tried to contain hyperinflation including zeroes cuts, price freezes and even confiscation of bank accounts.

The highest value was in March 1990, when the government inflation index reached 82.39%. Hyperinflation ended in July 1994 with the Real Plan during the government of Itamar Franco. During the period of inflation Brazil adopted a total of six different currencies, as the government constantly changed due to rapid devaluation and increase in the number of zeros.

===China===
Hyperinflation was a major factor in the collapse of the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek.

After a brief decrease following the defeat of Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War, hyperinflation resumed in October 1945. From 1948 to 1949, near the end of the Chinese Civil War, the Republic of China went through a period of hyperinflation. In 1947, the highest denomination bill was 50,000 yuan. By mid-1948, the highest denomination was 180,000,000 yuan.

In October 1948, the Nationalist government replaced its fabi currency with the gold yuan. The gold yuan deteriorated even faster than the fabi had.

The Communists gained significant legitimacy by defeating hyperinflation in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Their development of state trading agencies reintegrated markets and trading networks, ultimately stabilizing prices.

===France===
During the French Revolution and first Republic, the National Assembly issued bonds, some backed by seized church property, called assignats. Napoleon replaced them with the franc in 1803, at which time the assignats were basically worthless. Stephen D. Dillaye pointed out that one of the reasons for the failure was massive counterfeiting of the paper currency, largely through London. According to Dillaye: &quot;Seventeen manufacturing establishments were in full operation in London, with a force of four hundred men devoted to the production of false and forged Assignats.&quot;

===Germany (Weimar Republic)===
By November 1922, the value in gold of money in circulation had fallen from £300 million before World War I to £20 million. The Reichsbank responded by the unlimited printing of notes, thereby accelerating the devaluation of the mark. In his report to London, Lord D&#x27;Abernon wrote: &quot;In the whole course of history, no dog has ever run after its own tail with the speed of the Reichsbank.&quot; Germany went through its worst inflation in 1923. In 1922, the highest denomination was 50,000ℳ. By 1923, the highest denomination was 100,000,000,000,000ℳ ( marks). In December 1923 the exchange rate was 4,200,000,000,000ℳ ( marks) to 1 US dollar. In 1923, the rate of inflation hit percent per month (prices double every two days). Beginning on 20 November 1923, 1,000,000,000,000ℳ (ℳ, 1 trillion marks) were exchanged for 1 Rentenmark, so that RM 4.2 was worth 1 US dollar, exactly the same rate the mark had in 1914.

===Greece (German–Italian occupation)===

With the German invasion in April 1941, there was an abrupt increase in prices. This was due to psychological factors related to the fear of shortages and to the hoarding of goods. During the German and Italian Axis occupation of Greece (1941–1944), the agricultural, mineral, industrial etc. production of Greece were used to sustain the occupation forces, but also to secure provisions for the Afrika Korps. One part of these &quot;sales&quot; of provisions was settled with bilateral clearing through the German DEGRIGES and the Italian Sagic companies at very low prices. As the value of Greek exports in drachmas fell, the demand for drachmas followed suit and so did its forex rate. While shortages started due to naval blockades and hoarding, the prices of commodities soared. The other part of the &quot;purchases&quot; was settled with drachmas secured from the Bank of Greece and printed for this purpose by private printing presses. As prices soared, the Germans and Italians started requesting more and more drachmas from the Bank of Greece to offset price increases; each time prices increased, the note circulation followed suit soon afterwards. For the year starting November 1943, the inflation rate was %, the circulation was drachmae and one gold sovereign cost 43,167 billion drachmas. The hyperinflation started subsiding immediately after the departure of the German occupation forces, but inflation rates took several years to fall below 50%.

===Hungary===
The Treaty of Trianon and political instability between 1919 and 1924 led to a major inflation of Hungary&#x27;s currency. In 1921, in an attempt to stop this inflation, the national assembly of Hungary passed the Hegedüs reforms, including a 20% levy on bank deposits, but this precipitated a mistrust of banks by the public, especially the peasants, and resulted in a reduction in savings, and thus an increase in the amount of currency in circulation. Due to the reduced tax base, the government resorted to printing money, and in 1923 inflation in Hungary reached 98% per month.

Between the end of 1945 and July 1946, Hungary went through the highest inflation ever recorded. In 1944, the highest banknote value was 1,000 P. By the end of 1945, it was 10,000,000 P, and the highest value in mid-1946 was 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 P (1020 pengő). A special currency, the adópengő (or &quot;tax pengő&quot;) was created for tax and postal payments. The inflation was such that the value of the adópengő was adjusted each day by radio announcement. On 1 January 1946, one adópengő equaled one pengő, but by late July, one adópengő equaled 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 P or 2×1021 P (2 sextillion pengő).

When the pengő was replaced in August 1946 by the forint, the total value of all Hungarian banknotes in circulation amounted to of one US cent. Inflation had peaked at % per month (i.e. prices doubled every 15.6 hours). On 18 August 1946, 400,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 P (4 pengő, or four hundred octillion on short scale) became 1 Ft.

===Malaya and Singapore (Japanese occupation)===
Malaya and Singapore were under Japanese occupation from 1942 until 1945. The Japanese issued &quot;banana notes&quot; as the official currency to replace the Straits currency issued by the British. During that time, the cost of basic necessities increased drastically. As the occupation proceeded, the Japanese authorities printed more money to fund their wartime activities, which resulted in hyperinflation and a severe depreciation in value of the banana note.

From February to December 1942, $100 of Straits currency was worth $100 in Japanese scrip, after which the value of Japanese scrip began to erode, reaching $385 in December 1943 and $1,850 one year later. By 1 August 1945, this had inflated to $10,500, and 11 days later it had reached $95,000. After 13 August 1945, Japanese scrip had become valueless.

===North Korea===
North Korea most likely experienced hyperinflation from December 2009 to mid-January 2011. Based on the price of rice, North Korea&#x27;s hyperinflation peaked in mid-January 2010, but according to black market exchange-rate data, and calculations based on purchasing power parity, North Korea experienced its peak month of inflation in early March 2010. These data points are unofficial, however, and therefore must be treated with a degree of caution.

=== Peru ===
In modern history, Peru underwent a period of hyperinflation in the 1980s to the early 1990s starting with President Fernando Belaúnde&#x27;s second administration, heightened during Alan García&#x27;s first administration, to the beginning of Alberto Fujimori&#x27;s term. 1 US dollar was worth over S/3,210,000,000. Garcia&#x27;s term introduced the inti, which worsened inflation into hyperinflation. Peru&#x27;s currency and economy were stabilized under Fujimori&#x27;s Nuevo Sol program, which has remained Peru&#x27;s currency since 1991.

===Poland===
Poland has gone through two episodes of hyperinflation since the country regained independence following the end of World War I, the first in 1923, the second in 1989–1990. Both events resulted in the introduction of new currencies. In 1924, the złoty replaced the original currency of post-war Poland, the mark. This currency was subsequently replaced by another of the same name in 1950. As a result of the second hyperinflation crisis, the current &quot;new złoty&quot; was introduced in 1995 (ISO code: PLN).

The newly independent Poland had been struggling with a large budget deficit since its inception in 1918 but it was in 1923 when inflation reached its peak. The exchange rate of the Polish mark (Mp) to the US dollar dropped from Mp 9.— per dollar in 1918 to Mp 6,375,000.— per dollar at the end of 1923. A new personal &#x27;inflation tax&#x27; was introduced. The resolution of the crisis is attributed to Władysław Grabski, who became prime minister of Poland in December 1923. Having nominated an all-new government and being granted extraordinary lawmaking powers by the Sejm for a period of six months, he introduced a new currency, the &quot;złoty&quot; (&quot;golden&quot; in Polish), established a new national bank and scrapped the inflation tax, which took place throughout 1924.

The economic crisis in Poland in the 1980s was accompanied by rising inflation when new money was printed to cover a budget deficit. Although inflation was not as acute as in 1920s, it is estimated that its annual rate reached around 600% in a period of over a year spanning parts of 1989 and 1990. The economy was stabilised by the adoption of the Balcerowicz Plan in 1989, named after the main author of the reforms, minister of finance Leszek Balcerowicz. The plan was largely inspired by the previous Grabski&#x27;s reforms.

===Philippines===
The Japanese government occupying the Philippines during World War II issued fiat currencies for general circulation. The Japanese-sponsored Second Philippine Republic government led by Jose P. Laurel at the same time outlawed possession of other currencies, most especially &quot;guerrilla money&quot;. The fiat money&#x27;s lack of value earned it the derisive nickname &quot;Mickey Mouse money&quot;. Survivors of the war often tell tales of bringing suitcases or &quot;bayong&quot; (native bags made of woven coconut or buri leaf strips) overflowing with Japanese-issued notes. Early on, 75 JIM pesos could buy one duck egg. In 1944, a box of matches cost more than 100 JIM pesos.

In 1942, the highest denomination available was ₱10. Before the end of the war, because of inflation, the Japanese government was forced to issue ₱100, ₱500, and ₱1,000 notes.

===Soviet Union===
A seven-year period of uncontrollable spiralling inflation occurred in the early Soviet Union, running from the earliest days of the Bolshevik Revolution in November 1917 to the reestablishment of the gold standard with the introduction of the chervonets as part of the New Economic Policy. The inflationary crisis effectively ended in March 1924 with the introduction of the so-called &quot;gold ruble&quot; as the country&#x27;s standard currency.

The early Soviet hyperinflationary period was marked by three successive redenominations of its currency, in which &quot;new rubles&quot; replaced old at the rates of 10,000:1 (1 January 1922), 100:1 (1 January 1923), and 50,000:1 (7 March 1924), respectively.

Between 1921 and 1922, inflation in the Soviet Union reached 213%.

=== Venezuela ===


Venezuela&#x27;s hyperinflation began in November 2016. Inflation of Venezuela&#x27;s bolivar fuerte (VEF) in 2014 reached 69% and was the highest in the world. In 2015, inflation was 181%, the highest in the world and the highest in the country&#x27;s history at that time, 800% in 2016, over 4,000% in 2017, and 1,698,488% in 2018, with Venezuela spiraling into hyperinflation. While the Venezuelan government &quot;has essentially stopped&quot; producing official inflation estimates as of early 2018, one estimate of the rate at that time was 5,220%, according to inflation economist Steve Hanke of Johns Hopkins University.

Inflation has affected Venezuelans so much that in 2017, some people became video game gold farmers and could be seen playing games such as &quot;RuneScape&quot; to sell in-game currency or characters for real currency. In many cases, these gamers made more money than salaried workers in Venezuela even though they were earning just a few dollars per day. During the Christmas season of 2017, some shops would no longer use price tags since prices would inflate so quickly, so customers were required to ask staff at stores, known as (&quot;talkers&quot;), how much each item was. Some then further cut costs by replacing the &quot;talkers&quot; with computer screens.

The International Monetary Fund estimated in 2018 that Venezuela&#x27;s inflation rate would reach 1,000,000% by the end of the year. This forecast was criticized by Steve H. Hanke, professor of applied economics at The Johns Hopkins University and senior fellow at the Cato Institute. According to Hanke, the IMF had released a &quot;bogus forecast&quot; because &quot;no one has ever been able to accurately forecast the course or the duration of an episode of hyperinflation. But that has not stopped the IMF from offering inflation forecasts for Venezuela that have proven to be wildly inaccurate&quot;.

In July 2018, hyperinflation in Venezuela was sitting at 33,151%, &quot;the 23rd most severe episode of hyperinflation in history&quot;.

In April 2019, the International Monetary Fund estimated that inflation would reach 10,000,000% by the end of 2019.

In May 2019, the Central Bank of Venezuela released economic data for the first time since 2015. According to this release, the inflation of Venezuela was 274% in 2016, 863% in 2017 and 130,060% in 2018. The annualised inflation rate as of April 2019 was estimated to be 282,972.8% as of April 2019, and cumulative inflation from 2016 to April 2019 was estimated at 53,798,500%.

The new reports imply a contraction of more than half of the economy in five years, according to the &quot;Financial Times&quot; &quot;one of the biggest contractions in Latin American history&quot;. According to undisclosed sources from Reuters, the release of these numbers was due to pressure from China, a Maduro ally. One of these sources claims that the disclosure of economic numbers may bring Venezuela into compliance with the IMF, making it harder to support Juan Guaidó during the presidential crisis. At the time, the IMF was not able to support the validity of the data as they had not been able to contact the authorities.

===Vietnam===
Vietnam went through a period of chaos and high inflation in the late 1980s, with inflation peaking at 774% in 1988, after the country&#x27;s &quot;price-wage-currency&quot; reform package, led by then-Deputy Prime Minister , had failed. High inflation also occurred in the early stages of the socialist-oriented market economic reforms commonly referred to as the Đổi Mới.

===Yugoslavia===
Hyperinflation in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia happened before and during the period of breakup of Yugoslavia, from 1989 to 1991. In April 1992, one of its successor states, FR Yugoslavia, entered a period of hyperinflation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, that lasted until 1994. One of several regional conflicts accompanying the dissolution of Yugoslavia was the Bosnian War (1992–1995). The Belgrade government of Slobodan Milošević backed ethnic Serbian forces in the conflict, resulting in a United Nations boycott of Yugoslavia. The UN boycott collapsed an economy already weakened by regional war, with the projected monthly inflation rate accelerating to one million percent by December 1993 (prices double every 2.3 days).

The highest denomination in 1988 was 50,000 . By 1989, it was 2,000,000 . In the 1990 currency reform, 1 new dinar was exchanged for 10,000 old dinars. After socialist Yugoslavia broke up, the 1992 currency reform in FR Yugoslavia led to 1 new dinar being exchanged for 10 old dinars. The highest denomination in 1992 was 50,000 . By 1993, it was 10,000,000,000 . In the 1993 currency reform, 1 new dinar was exchanged for 1,000,000 old dinars. Before the year was over, however, the highest denomination was 500,000,000,000 dinars. In the 1994 currency reform, 1 new dinar was exchanged for 1,000,000,000 old dinars. In another currency reform a month later, 1 novi dinar was exchanged for 13 million dinars (1 novi dinar = 1 Deutschmark at the time of exchange). The overall impact of hyperinflation was that 1 novi dinar was equal to – pre-1990 dinars. Yugoslavia&#x27;s rate of inflation hit % cumulative inflation over the time period 1 October 1993 and 24 January 1994.

===Zimbabwe===


Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe was one of the few instances that resulted in the abandonment of the local currency. At independence in 1980, the Zimbabwe dollar (ZWD) was worth about US$1.49 (or 67 Zimbabwean cents per U.S. dollar). Afterwards, however, rampant inflation and the collapse of the economy severely devalued the currency. Inflation was relatively steady until the early 1990s when economic disruption caused by failed land reform agreements and rampant government corruption resulted in reductions in food production and the decline of foreign investment. Several multinational companies began hoarding retail goods in warehouses in Zimbabwe and just south of the border, preventing commodities from becoming available on the market. The result was that to pay its expenditures Mugabe&#x27;s government and Gideon Gono&#x27;s Reserve Bank printed more and more notes with higher face values.

Hyperinflation began early in the 21st century, reaching 624% in 2004. It fell back to low triple digits before surging to a new high of 1,730% in 2006. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe revalued on 1 August 2006 at a ratio of 1,000 ZWD to each second dollar (ZWN), but year-to-year inflation rose by June 2007 to 11,000% (versus an earlier estimate of 9,000%). Larger denominations were progressively issued in 2008:
# 5 May: banknotes or &quot;bearer cheques&quot; for the value of Z$100 million and Z$250 million.
# 15 May: new bearer cheques with a value of Z$500 million (then equivalent to about US$2.50).
# 20 May: a new series of notes (&quot;agro cheques&quot;) in denominations of Z$5 billion, Z$25 billion and Z$50 billion.
# 21 July: a &quot;special agro-cheque&quot; for Z$100 billion.

Inflation by 16 July officially surged to 2,200,000% with some analysts estimating figures surpassing 9,000,000%. As of 22 July 2008 the value of the Zimbabwe dollar fell to approximately Z$688 billion per US$1, or Z$688 trillion in pre-August 2006 Zimbabwean dollars.

On 1 August 2008, the Zimbabwe dollar was redenominated at the ratio of ZWN to each third dollar (ZWR). On 19 August 2008, official figures announced for June estimated the inflation over 11,250,000%. Zimbabwe&#x27;s annual inflation was 231,000,000% in July (prices doubling every 17.3 days). By October 2008 Zimbabwe was mired in hyperinflation with wages falling far behind inflation. In this dysfunctional economy hospitals and schools had chronic staffing problems, because many nurses and teachers could not afford bus fare to work. Most of the capital of Harare was without water because the authorities had stopped paying the bills to buy and transport the treatment chemicals. Desperate for foreign currency to keep the government functioning, Zimbabwe&#x27;s central bank governor, Gideon Gono, sent runners into the streets with suitcases of Zimbabwean dollars to buy up American dollars and South African rand.

For periods after July 2008, no official inflation statistics were released. Prof. Steve H. Hanke overcame the problem by estimating inflation rates after July 2008 and publishing the Hanke Hyperinflation Index for Zimbabwe. Prof. Hanke&#x27;s HHIZ measure indicated that the inflation peaked at an annual rate of 89.7 sextillion percent (89,700,000,000,000,000,000,000%, or %) in mid-November 2008. The peak monthly rate was 79.6 billion percent, which is equivalent to a 98% daily rate, or around % yearly rate. At that rate, prices were doubling every 24.7 hours. Note that many of these figures should be considered mostly theoretical since hyperinflation did not proceed at this rate over a whole year.
At its November 2008 peak, Zimbabwe&#x27;s rate of inflation approached, but failed to surpass, Hungary&#x27;s July 1946 world record. On 2 February 2009, the dollar was redenominated for the third time at the ratio of ZWR to 1 ZWL, only three weeks after the Z$100 trillion banknote was issued on 16 January, but hyperinflation waned by then as official inflation rates in USD were announced and foreign transactions were legalised, and on 12 April the Zimbabwe dollar was abandoned in favour of using only foreign currencies. The overall impact of hyperinflation was US$1 = Z$.
* Start and end date: March 2007 – mid November 2008
* Peak month and rate of inflation: mid November 2008, %
Ironically, following the abandonment of the ZWR and subsequent use of reserve currencies, banknotes from the hyperinflation period of the old Zimbabwe dollar began attracting international attention as collectors items, having accrued numismatic value, selling for prices many orders of magnitude higher than their old purchasing power.

==Units of inflation==
Inflation rate is usually measured in percent per year. It can also be measured in percent per month or in price doubling time.

formula_2

formula_3

formula_4

Often, at redenominations, three zeros are cut from the face values of denominations. It can be read from the table that if the (annual) inflation is for example 100%, it takes about 3.32 years for prices to increase by an order of magnitude (e.g., to produce one more zero on the price tags), or 9.97 years to produce three zeros. Thus can one expect a redenomination to take place about ten years after the currency was introduced.

<text>Herbert Clark Hoover (August 10, 1874 – October 20, 1964) was the 31st president of the United States, serving from 1929 to 1933. A wealthy mining engineer before his presidency, Hoover led the wartime Commission for Relief in Belgium and was the director of the U.S. Food Administration, followed by post-war relief of Europe. As a member of the Republican Party, he served as United States Secretary of Commerce from 1921 to 1928 before being elected president in 1928. His presidency was dominated by the Great Depression, and his policies and methods to combat it were seen as lackluster. Amid his unpopularity, he decisively lost reelection to Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932.

Born to a Quaker family in West Branch, Iowa, Hoover grew up in Oregon. He was one of the first graduates of the new Stanford University in 1895. Hoover took a position with a London-based mining company working in Australia and China. He rapidly became a wealthy mining engineer. In 1914, the outbreak of World War I, he organized and headed the Commission for Relief in Belgium, an international relief organization that provided food to occupied Belgium. When the U.S. entered the war in 1917, President Woodrow Wilson appointed Hoover to lead the Food Administration. He became famous as his country&#x27;s &quot;food dictator&quot;. After the war, Hoover led the American Relief Administration, which provided food to the starving millions in Central and Eastern Europe, especially Russia. Hoover&#x27;s wartime service made him a favorite of many progressives, and he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in the 1920 U.S. presidential election.

Hoover served as the secretary of commerce under presidents Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. Hoover was an unusually active and visible Cabinet member, becoming known as &quot;Secretary of Commerce and Under-Secretary of all other departments.&quot; He was influential in the development of air travel and radio. Hoover led the federal response to the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. He won the Republican nomination in the 1928 presidential election and defeated Democratic candidate Al Smith in a landslide. In 1929, Hoover assumed the presidency. However, during his first year in office, the stock market crashed, signaling the onset of the Great Depression, which dominated Hoover&#x27;s presidency until its end. His response to the depression was widely seen as lackluster and he scapegoated Mexican Americans for the economic crisis. Approximately one million Mexican Americans were forcibly &quot;repatriated&quot; to Mexico in a forced migration campaign known as the Mexican Repatriation even though a majority of them were born in the United States.

In the midst of the Great Depression, he was decisively defeated by Democratic nominee Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. Hoover&#x27;s retirement was over 31 years long, one of the longest presidential retirements. He authored numerous works and became increasingly conservative in retirement. He strongly criticized Roosevelt&#x27;s foreign policy and the New Deal. In the 1940s and 1950s, public opinion of Hoover improved, largely due to his service in various assignments for presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, including chairing the influential Hoover Commission. Critical assessments of his presidency by historians and political scientists generally rank him as a significantly below-average president, although Hoover has received praise for his actions as a humanitarian and public official.

==Early life and education==
Herbert Clark Hoover was born on August 10, 1874, in West Branch, Iowa. His father, Jesse Hoover, was a blacksmith and farm implement store owner of German, Swiss, and English ancestry. Hoover&#x27;s mother, Hulda Randall Minthorn, was raised in Norwich, Ontario, Canada, before moving to Iowa in 1859. Like most other citizens of West Branch, Jesse and Hulda were Quakers. Around age two &quot;Bertie&quot;, as he was called during that time, contracted a serious bout of croup, and was momentarily thought to have died until resuscitated by his uncle, John Minthorn. As a young child he was often referred to by his father as &quot;my little stick in the mud&quot; when he repeatedly got trapped in the mud crossing the unpaved street. Herbert&#x27;s family figured prominently in the town&#x27;s public prayer life, due almost entirely to mother Hulda&#x27;s role in the church. As a child, Hoover consistently attended schools, but he did little reading on his own aside from the Bible. Hoover&#x27;s father, noted by the local paper for his &quot;pleasant, sunshiny disposition&quot;, died in 1880 at the age of 34 of a sudden heart attack. Hoover&#x27;s mother died in 1884 of typhoid, leaving Hoover, his older brother, Theodore, and his younger sister, May, as orphans. Hoover lived the next 18 months with his uncle Allen Hoover at a nearby farm.

In November 1885, Hoover was sent to Newberg, Oregon, to live with his uncle John Minthorn, a Quaker physician and businessman whose own son had died the year before. The Minthorn household was considered cultured and educational, and imparted a strong work ethic. Much like West Branch, Newberg was a frontier town settled largely by Midwestern Quakers. Minthorn ensured that Hoover received an education, but Hoover disliked the many chores assigned to him and often resented Minthorn. One observer described Hoover as &quot;an orphan [who] seemed to be neglected in many ways&quot;. Hoover attended Friends Pacific Academy (now George Fox University), but dropped out at the age of thirteen to become an office assistant for his uncle&#x27;s real estate office (Oregon Land Company) in Salem, Oregon. Though he did not attend high school, Hoover learned bookkeeping, typing, and mathematics at a night school.

Hoover was a member of the inaugural &quot;Pioneer Class&quot; of Stanford University, entering in 1891 despite failing all the entrance exams except mathematics. During his freshman year, he switched his major from mechanical engineering to geology after working for John Casper Branner, the chairman of Stanford&#x27;s geology department. During his sophomore year, Sam Collins proposed founding, &quot;Romero Hall Boarding Club&quot;, the first student cooperative boarding house at Romero Hall, for &quot;sociability and economy&quot;, which Hoover and William Foster Hidden co-founded. Hoover was a mediocre student, and he spent much of his time working in various part-time jobs or participating in campus activities. Though he was initially shy among fellow students, Hoover won election as student treasurer and became known for his distaste for fraternities and sororities. He served as student manager of both the baseball and football teams, and helped organize the inaugural Big Game versus the University of California. During the summers before and after his senior year, Hoover interned under economic geologist Waldemar Lindgren of the United States Geological Survey; these experiences convinced Hoover to pursue a career as a mining geologist.

==Mining engineer==

===Bewick, Moreing===
When Hoover graduated from Stanford in 1895, the country was in the midst of the Panic of 1893 and he initially struggled to find a job. He worked in various low-level mining jobs in the Sierra Nevada Mountains until persuading prominent mining engineer Louis Janin to hire him. After working as a mine scout for a year, Hoover was hired by Bewick, Moreing &amp; Co. (&quot;Bewick&quot;), a London-based company that operated gold mines in Western Australia. He first went to Coolgardie, then the center of the Eastern Goldfields, which was actually in Western Australia, receiving a $5,000 salary (). Conditions were harsh in the goldfields; Hoover described the Coolgardie and Murchison rangelands on the edge of the Great Victoria Desert as a land of &quot;black flies, red dust and white heat&quot;.

Hoover traveled constantly across the Outback to evaluate and manage the company&#x27;s mines. He convinced Bewick to purchase the Sons of Gwalia gold mine, which proved to be one of the most successful mines in the region. Partly due to Hoover&#x27;s efforts, the company eventually controlled approximately 50 percent of gold production in Western Australia. Hoover brought in many Italian immigrants to cut costs and counter the labour movement of the Australian miners. During his time with the mining company, Hoover became opposed to measures such as a minimum wage and workers&#x27; compensation, feeling that they were unfair to owners. Hoover&#x27;s work impressed his employers, and in 1898 he was promoted to junior partner. An open feud developed between Hoover and his boss, Ernest Williams, but Bewick&#x27;s leaders defused the situation by offering Hoover a compelling position in China.

Upon arriving in China, Hoover developed gold mines near Tianjin on behalf of Bewick and the Chinese-owned Chinese Engineering and Mining Company. He became deeply interested in Chinese history, but gave up on learning the language to a fluent level. He publicly warned that Chinese workers were inefficient and racially inferior. He made recommendations to improve the lot of the Chinese worker, seeking to end the practice of imposing long-term servitude contracts and to institute reforms for workers based on merit. The Boxer Rebellion broke out shortly after the Hoovers arrived in China, trapping them and numerous other foreign nationals until a multi-national military force defeated Boxer forces in the Battle of Tientsin. Fearing the imminent collapse of the Chinese government, the director of the Chinese Engineering and Mining Company agreed to establish a new Sino-British venture with Bewick. After they established effective control over the new Chinese mining company, Hoover became the operating partner in late 1901.

In this role, Hoover continually traveled the world on behalf of Bewick, visiting mines operated by the company on different continents. Beginning in December 1902, the company faced mounting legal and financial issues after one of the partners admitted to having fraudulently sold stock in a mine. More issues arose in 1904 after the British government formed two separate royal commissions to investigate Bewick&#x27;s labor practices and financial dealings in Western Australia. After the company lost a lawsuit Hoover began looking for a way to get out of the partnership, and he sold his shares in mid-1908.

===Sole proprietor===
After leaving Bewick, Moreing, Hoover worked as a London-based independent mining consultant and financier. Though he had risen to prominence as a geologist and mine operator, Hoover focused much of his attention on raising money, restructuring corporate organizations, and financing new ventures. He specialized in rejuvenating troubled mining operations, taking a share of the profits in exchange for his technical and financial expertise. Hoover thought of himself and his associates as &quot;engineering doctors to sick concerns&quot;, and he earned a reputation as a &quot;doctor of sick mines&quot;. He made investments on every continent and had offices in San Francisco; London; New York City; Paris; Petrograd; and Mandalay, British Burma. By 1914, Hoover was a very wealthy man, with an estimated personal fortune of $4 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

Hoover co-founded the Zinc Corporation to extract zinc near the Australian city of Broken Hill, New South Wales. The Zinc Corporation developed the froth flotation process to extract zinc from lead-silver ore and operated the world&#x27;s first selective ore differential flotation plant. Hoover worked with the Burma Corporation, a British firm that produced silver, lead, and zinc in large quantities at the Namtu Bawdwin Mine. He also helped increase copper production in Kyshtym, Russia, through the use of pyritic smelting. He also agreed to manage a separate mine in the Altai Mountains that, according to Hoover, &quot;developed probably the greatest and richest single body of ore known in the world&quot;.

In his spare time, Hoover wrote. His lectures at Columbia and Stanford universities were published in 1909 as &quot;Principles of Mining&quot;, which became a standard textbook. The book reflects his move towards progressive ideals, as Hoover came to endorse eight-hour workdays and organized labor. Hoover became deeply interested in the history of science, and he was especially drawn to the &quot;De re metallica&quot;, an influential 16th century work on mining and metallurgy by Georgius Agricola. In 1912, Hoover and his wife published the first English translation of &quot;De re metallica&quot;. Hoover also joined the board of trustees at Stanford, and led a successful campaign to appoint John Branner as the university&#x27;s president.

==Marriage and family==
During his senior year at Stanford, Hoover became smitten with a classmate named Lou Henry, though his financial situation precluded marriage at that time. The daughter of a banker from Monterey, California, Lou Henry decided to study geology at Stanford after attending a lecture delivered by John C. Branner. Immediately after earning a promotion in 1898, Hoover cabled Lou Henry, asking her to marry him. After she cabled back her acceptance of the proposal, Hoover briefly returned to the United States for their wedding. They would remain married until Lou Henry Hoover&#x27;s death in 1944. Hoover was the first president to be a widower since Woodrow Wilson.

Though his Quaker upbringing strongly influenced his career, Hoover rarely attended Quaker meetings during his adult life. Hoover and his wife had two children: Herbert Hoover Jr. (born in 1903) and Allan Henry Hoover (born in 1907). The Hoover family began living in London in 1902, though they frequently traveled as part of Hoover&#x27;s career. After 1916, the Hoovers began living in the United States, maintaining homes in Stanford, California, and Washington, D.C. Hoover&#x27;s great-granddaughter (through Allan) is conservative political commentator, strategist, media personality and author Margaret Hoover.

Hoover&#x27;s elder brother Theodore also studied mining engineering at Stanford, and returned there to become dean of the engineering school. In retirement, Theodore bought a large property on the remote north coast of Santa Cruz County. The Theodore J. Hoover Natural Preserve is now part of Big Basin State Park.

==World War I and aftermath==

===Relief in Europe===
World War I broke out in August 1914, pitting Germany and its allies against France and its allies. The German Schlieffen plan was to achieve a quick victory by marching through neutral Belgium to envelop the French Army east of Paris. The maneuver failed to reach Paris, however the Germans were successful in taking nearly all of Belgium and would occupy the majority of nation for the remainder of the war. Hoover and other London-based American businessmen established a committee to organize the return of the roughly 100,000 Americans stranded in Europe. Hoover was appointed as the committee&#x27;s chairman and, with the assent of Congress and the Wilson administration, took charge of the distribution of relief to Americans in Europe. Hoover later stated, &quot;I did not realize it at the moment, but on August 3, 1914, my career was over forever. I was on the slippery road of public life.&quot; By early October 1914, Hoover&#x27;s organization had distributed relief to at least 40,000 Americans.

The German invasion of Belgium in August 1914 set a food crisis into motion in Belgium, a nation which relied heavily on food imports. The Germans refused to take responsibility for feeding Belgian citizens in captured territory, and the British refused to lift their blockade of German-occupied Belgium unless the U.S. government supervised Belgian food imports as a neutral party in the war. With the cooperation of the Wilson administration and the CNSA, a Belgian relief organization, Hoover established the Commission for Relief in Belgium (CRB). The CRB obtained and imported millions of tons of foodstuffs for the CNSA to distribute, and helped ensure that the German army did not appropriate the food. Private donations and government grants supplied the majority of its $11-million-a-month budget, and the CRB became a veritable independent republic of relief, with its own flag, navy, factories, mills, and railroads.

Hoover worked 14-hour days from London, administering the distribution of over two million tons of food to nine million war victims. In an early form of shuttle diplomacy, he crossed the North Sea forty times to meet with German authorities and persuade them to allow food shipments. He also convinced British Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George to allow individuals to send money to the people of Belgium, thereby lessening workload of the CRB. At the request of the French government, the CRB began delivering supplies to the people of German-occupied Northern France in 1915. In 1926, American diplomat Walter Page described Hoover as &quot;probably the only man living who has privately (i.e., without holding office) negotiated understandings with the British, French, German, Dutch, and Belgian governments&quot;.

===U.S. Food Administration===
War upon Germany was declared in April 1917, and American food was essential to Allied victory. With the U.S. mobilizing for war, President Wilson appointed Hoover to head the U.S. Food Administration, which was charged with ensuring the nation&#x27;s food needs during the war. Hoover had hoped to join the administration in some capacity since at least 1916, and he obtained the position after lobbying several members of Congress and Wilson&#x27;s confidant, Edward M. House. Earning the appellation of &quot;food czar&quot;, Hoover recruited a volunteer force of hundreds of thousands of women and deployed propaganda in movie theaters, schools, and churches. He carefully selected men to assist in the agency leadership—Alonzo E. Taylor (technical abilities), Robert Taft (political associations), Gifford Pinchot (agricultural influence), and Julius Barnes (business acumen).

World War I had created a global food crisis that dramatically increased food prices and caused food riots and starvation in the countries at war. Hoover&#x27;s chief goal as food czar was to provide supplies to the Allied Powers, but he also sought to stabilize domestic prices and to prevent domestic shortages. Under the broad powers granted by the Food and Fuel Control Act, the Food Administration supervised food production throughout the United States, and the administration made use of its authority to buy, import, store, and sell food. Determined to avoid rationing, Hoover established set days for people to avoid eating specified foods and save them for soldiers&#x27; rations: meatless Mondays, wheatless Wednesdays, and &quot;when in doubt, eat potatoes&quot;. These policies were dubbed &quot;Hooverizing&quot; by government publicists, in spite of Hoover&#x27;s continual orders that publicity should not mention him by name. The Food Administration shipped 23 million metric tons of food to the Allied Powers, preventing their collapse and earning Hoover great acclaim. As head of the Food Administration, Hoover gained a following in the United States, especially among progressives who saw in Hoover an expert administrator and symbol of efficiency. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society during his tenure.

===Post-war relief in Europe===

World War I came to an end in November 1918, but Europe continued to face a critical food situation; Hoover estimated that as many as 400 million people faced the possibility of starvation. The United States Food Administration became the American Relief Administration (ARA), and Hoover was charged with providing food to Central and Eastern Europe. In addition to providing relief, the ARA rebuilt infrastructure in an effort to rejuvenate the economy of Europe. Throughout the Paris Peace Conference, Hoover served as a close adviser to President Wilson, and he largely shared Wilson&#x27;s goals of establishing the League of Nations, settling borders on the basis of self-determination, and refraining from inflicting a harsh punishment on the defeated Central Powers. The following year, the famed British economist John Maynard Keynes wrote in The Economic Consequences of the Peace that if Hoover&#x27;s realism, &quot;knowledge, magnanimity and disinterestedness&quot; had found wider play in the councils of Paris, the world would have had &quot;the Good Peace&quot;. After U.S. government funding for the ARA expired in mid-1919, Hoover transformed the ARA into a private organization, raising millions of dollars from private donors. He also established the European Children&#x27;s Fund, which provided relief to fifteen million children across fourteen countries.

Despite the opposition of Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and other Republicans, Hoover provided aid to the defeated German nation after the war, as well as relief to famine-stricken Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Hoover condemned the Bolsheviks but warned President Wilson against an intervention in the Russian Civil War, as he viewed the White Russian forces as little better than the Bolsheviks and feared the possibility of a protracted U.S. involvement. The Russian famine of 1921–22 claimed six million people, but the intervention of the ARA likely saved millions of lives. When asked if he was not helping Bolshevism by providing relief, Hoover stated, &quot;twenty million people are starving. Whatever their politics, they shall be fed!&quot; Reflecting the gratitude of many Europeans, in July 1922, Soviet author Maxim Gorky told Hoover that &quot;your help will enter history as a unique, gigantic achievement, worthy of the greatest glory, which will long remain in the memory of millions of Russians whom you have saved from death&quot;.

In 1919, Hoover established the Hoover War Collection at Stanford University. He donated all the files of the Commission for Relief in Belgium, the U.S. Food Administration, and the American Relief Administration, and pledged $50,000 as an endowment (). Scholars were sent to Europe to collect pamphlets, society publications, government documents, newspapers, posters, proclamations, and other ephemeral materials related to the war and the revolutions that followed it. The collection was renamed the Hoover War Library in 1922 and is now known as the Hoover Institution Library and Archives. During the post-war period, Hoover also served as the president of the Federated American Engineering Societies.

===1920 election===

Hoover had been little known among the American public before 1914, but his service in the Wilson administration established him as a contender in the 1920 presidential election. Hoover&#x27;s wartime push for higher taxes, criticism of Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer&#x27;s actions during the First Red Scare, and his advocacy for measures such as the minimum wage, forty-eight-hour workweek, and elimination of child labor made him appealing to progressives of both parties. Despite his service in the Democratic administration of Woodrow Wilson, Hoover had never been closely affiliated with either the Democrats or the Republicans. He initially sought to avoid committing to any party in the 1920 election, hoping that either of the two major parties would draft him for president at their national conventions. In March 1920, he changed strategy and declared himself a Republican; he was motivated in large part by the belief that the Democrats had little chance of winning. Despite his national renown, Hoover&#x27;s service in the Wilson administration had alienated farmers and the conservative Old Guard of the GOP, and his presidential candidacy fizzled out after his defeat in the California primary by favorite son Hiram Johnson. At the 1920 Republican National Convention, Warren G. Harding emerged as a compromise candidate after the convention became deadlocked between supporters of Johnson, Leonard Wood, and Frank Orren Lowden. Hoover backed Harding&#x27;s successful campaign in the general election, and he began laying the groundwork for a future presidential run by building a base of strong supporters in the Republican Party.

==Secretary of Commerce (1921–1928)==
After his election as president in 1920, Harding rewarded Hoover for his support, offering to appoint him as either Secretary of the Interior or Secretary of Commerce. Secretary of Commerce was considered a minor Cabinet post, with limited and vaguely defined responsibilities, but Hoover decided to accept the position. Hoover&#x27;s progressive stances, continuing support for the League of Nations, and recent conversion to the Republican Party aroused opposition to his appointment from many Senate Republicans. To overcome this opposition, Harding paired Hoover&#x27;s nomination with that of conservative favorite Andrew Mellon as Secretary of the Treasury, and the nominations of both Hoover and Mellon were confirmed by the Senate. Hoover would serve as Secretary of Commerce from 1921 to 1928, serving under Harding and, after Harding&#x27;s death in 1923, President Calvin Coolidge. While some of the most prominent members of the Harding administration, including Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty and Secretary of Interior Albert B. Fall, were implicated in major scandals, Hoover emerged largely unscathed from investigations into the Harding administration.

Hoover envisioned the Commerce Department as the hub of the nation&#x27;s growth and stability. His experience mobilizing the war-time economy convinced him that the federal government could promote efficiency by eliminating waste, increasing production, encouraging the adoption of data-based practices, investing in infrastructure, and conserving natural resources. Contemporaries described Hoover&#x27;s approach as a &quot;third alternative&quot; between &quot;unrestrained capitalism&quot; and socialism, which was becoming increasingly popular in Europe. Hoover sought to foster a balance among labor, capital, and the government, and for this, he has been variously labeled a corporatist or an associationalist. A high priority was economic diplomacy, including promoting the growth of exports, as well as protection against monopolistic practices of foreign governments, especially regarding rubber and coffee.

Hoover demanded, and received, authority to coordinate economic affairs throughout the government. He created many sub-departments and committees, overseeing and regulating everything from manufacturing statistics to air travel. In some instances, he &quot;seized&quot; control of responsibilities from other Cabinet departments when he deemed that they were not carrying out their responsibilities well; some began referring to him as the &quot;Secretary of Commerce and Under-Secretary of all other departments&quot;. In response to the Depression of 1920–21, he convinced Harding to assemble a presidential commission on unemployment, which encouraged local governments to engage in countercyclical infrastructure spending. He endorsed much of Mellon&#x27;s tax reduction program but favored a more progressive tax system and opposed the treasury secretary&#x27;s efforts to eliminate the estate tax.

===Regulation of radio and transportation===

Between 1923 and 1929, the number of families with radios grew from 300,000 to 10 million, and Hoover&#x27;s tenure as Secretary of Commerce heavily influenced radio use in the United States. Between 1922 and 1925, Hoover organized conferences between radio manufacturers, news agencies, and government organizations which played a key role in the organization, development, and regulation of radio broadcasting. Hoover also helped pass the Radio Act of 1927, which allowed the government to intervene and abolish radio stations that were deemed &quot;non-useful&quot; to the public. Hoover&#x27;s attempts at regulating radio were not supported by all congressmen, and he received much opposition from the Senate and from radio station owners.

Hoover was also influential in the early development of air travel, and he sought to create a thriving private industry boosted by indirect government subsidies. He encouraged the development of emergency landing fields, required all runways to be equipped with lights and radio beams, and encouraged farmers to make use of planes for crop dusting. He also established the federal government&#x27;s power to inspect planes and license pilots, setting a precedent for the later Federal Aviation Administration.

As Commerce Secretary, Hoover hosted national conferences on street traffic collectively known as the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety. Hoover&#x27;s chief objective was to address the growing casualty toll of traffic accidents, but the scope of the conferences grew and soon embraced motor vehicle standards, rules of the road, and urban traffic control. He left the invited interest groups to negotiate agreements among themselves, which were then presented for adoption by states and localities. Because automotive trade associations were the best organized, many of the positions taken by the conferences reflected their interests. The conferences issued a model Uniform Vehicle Code for adoption by the states and a Model Municipal Traffic Ordinance for adoption by cities. Both were widely influential, promoting greater uniformity between jurisdictions and tending to promote the automobile&#x27;s priority in city streets.

=== Hoover&#x27;s image building ===
Phillips Payson O&#x27;Brien argues that Hoover had a Britain problem. He had spent so many years living in Britain and Australia, as an employee of British companies, there was a risk that he would be labeled a British tool. There were three solutions, all of which he tried in close collaboration with the media, which greatly admired him. First came the image of the dispassionate scientist, emotionally uninvolved but always committed to finding and implementing the best possible solution. The second solution was to gain the reputation of a humanitarian, deeply concerned with the world&#x27;s troubles, such as famine in Belgium, as well as specific American problems which he had solved as food commissioner during the world war. The third solution to was to fall back on that old tactic of twisting the British tail. He employed that solution in 1925–1926 in the worldwide rubber crisis. The American auto industry consumed 70% of the world&#x27;s output, but British investors controlled much of the supply. Their plan was to drastically cut back on output from British Malaya, which had the effect of tripling rubber prices. Hoover energetically gave a series of speeches and interviews denouncing the monopolistic practice and demanding that it be ended. The American State Department wanted no such crisis and compromised the issue in 1926. By then Hoover had solved his image problem, and during his 1928 campaign he successfully squelched attacks that alleged he was too close to British interests.

===Mississippi flood===
The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 broke the banks and levees of the lower Mississippi River in early 1927, resulting in the flooding of millions of acres and leaving 1.5 million people displaced from their homes. Although disaster response did not fall under the duties of the Commerce Department, the governors of six states along the Mississippi River specifically asked President Coolidge to appoint Hoover to coordinate the response to the flood. Believing that disaster response was not the domain of the federal government, Coolidge initially refused to become involved, but he eventually acceded to political pressure and appointed Hoover to chair a special committee to help the region. Hoover established over one hundred tent cities and a fleet of more than six hundred vessels and raised $17 million (equivalent to $ million in ). In large part due to his leadership during the flood crisis, by 1928, Hoover had begun to overshadow President Coolidge himself. Though Hoover received wide acclaim for his role in the crisis, he ordered the suppression of reports of mistreatment of African Americans in refugee camps. He did so with the cooperation of black American leader Robert Russa Moton, who was promised unprecedented influence once Hoover became president.

===Other initiatives===
With the goal of encouraging wise business investments, Hoover made the Commerce Department a clearinghouse of information. He recruited numerous academics from various fields and tasked them with publishing reports on different aspects of the economy, including steel production and films. To eliminate waste, he encouraged standardization of products like automobile tires and baby bottle nipples. Other efforts at eliminating waste included reducing labor losses from trade disputes and seasonal fluctuations, reducing industrial losses from accident and injury, and reducing the amount of crude oil spilled during extraction and shipping. He promoted international trade by opening overseas offices to advise businessmen. Hoover was especially eager to promote Hollywood films overseas. His &quot;Own Your Own Home&quot; campaign was a collaboration to promote ownership of single-family dwellings, with groups such as the Better Houses in America movement, the Architects&#x27; Small House Service Bureau, and the Home Modernizing Bureau. He worked with bankers and the savings and loan industry to promote the new long-term home mortgage, which dramatically stimulated home construction. Other accomplishments included winning the agreement of U.S. Steel to adopt an eight-hour workday, and the fostering of the Colorado River Compact, a water rights compact among Southwestern states.

===Presidential election of 1928===
Hoover quietly gathered support for a future presidential bid throughout the 1920s, but he carefully avoided alienating Coolidge, who possibly could have run for another term in the 1928 presidential election. Along with the rest of the nation, he was surprised when Coolidge announced in August 1927 that he would not seek another term. With the impending retirement of Coolidge, Hoover immediately emerged as the front-runner for the 1928 Republican nomination, and he quickly put together a strong campaign team led by Hubert Work, Will H. Hays, and Reed Smoot. Coolidge was unwilling to anoint Hoover as his successor; on one occasion he remarked that, &quot;for six years that man has given me unsolicited advice—all of it bad&quot;. Despite his lukewarm feelings towards Hoover, Coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing the popular Commerce Secretary&#x27;s candidacy.

Many wary Republican leaders cast about for an alternative candidate, such as Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon or former secretary of state Charles Evans Hughes. However, Hughes and Mellon declined to run, and other potential contenders like Frank Orren Lowden and Vice President Charles G. Dawes failed to garner widespread support. Hoover won the presidential nomination on the first ballot of the 1928 Republican National Convention. Convention delegates considered re-nominating Vice President Charles Dawes to be Hoover&#x27;s running mate, but Coolidge, who hated Dawes, remarked that this would be &quot;a personal affront&quot; to him. The convention instead selected Senator Charles Curtis of Kansas. Hoover accepted the nomination at Stanford Stadium, telling a huge crowd that he would continue the policies of the Harding and Coolidge administrations. The Democrats nominated New York governor Al Smith, who became the first Catholic major party nominee for president.

Hoover submitted his resignation as Commerce Secretary on July 7, but Coolidge kept him on until August 21 to wind up pending business. Hoover centered his campaign around the Republican record of peace and prosperity, as well as his own reputation as a successful engineer and public official. Averse to giving political speeches, Hoover largely stayed out of the fray and left the campaigning to Curtis and other Republicans. Smith was more charismatic and gregarious than Hoover, but his campaign was damaged by anti-Catholicism and his overt opposition to Prohibition. Hoover had never been a strong proponent of Prohibition, but he accepted the Republican Party&#x27;s plank in favor of it and issued an ambivalent statement calling Prohibition &quot;a great social and economic experiment, noble in motive and far-reaching in purpose&quot;. In the South, Hoover and the national party pursued a &quot;lily-white&quot; strategy, removing black Republicans from leadership positions in an attempt to curry favor with white Southerners.

Hoover maintained polling leads throughout the 1928 campaign, and he decisively defeated Smith on election day, taking 58 percent of the popular vote and 444 of the 531 electoral votes. Historians agree that Hoover&#x27;s national reputation and the booming economy, combined with deep splits in the Democratic Party over religion and Prohibition, guaranteed his landslide victory. Hoover&#x27;s appeal to Southern white voters succeeded in cracking the &quot;Solid South&quot;, and he won five Southern states. Hoover&#x27;s victory was positively received by newspapers; one wrote that Hoover would &quot;drive so forcefully at the tasks now before the nation that the end of his eight years as president will find us looking back on an era of prodigious achievement&quot;.

Hoover&#x27;s detractors wondered why he did not do anything to reapportion congress after the 1920 United States census which saw an increase in urban and immigrant populations. The 1920 census was the first and only decennial census where the results were not used to reapportion Congress, which ultimately influenced the 1928 Electoral College and impacted the presidential election.

==Presidency (1929–1933)==

Hoover saw the presidency as a vehicle for improving the conditions of all Americans by encouraging public-private cooperation—what he termed &quot;volunteerism&quot;. He tended to oppose governmental coercion or intervention, as he thought they infringed on American ideals of individualism and self-reliance. The first major bill that he signed, the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929, established the Federal Farm Board in order to stabilize farm prices. Hoover made extensive use of commissions to study issues and propose solutions, and many of those commissions were sponsored by private donors rather than by the government. One of the commissions started by Hoover, the Research Committee on Social Trends, was tasked with surveying the entirety of American society. He appointed a Cabinet consisting largely of wealthy, business-oriented conservatives, including Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon. Lou Henry Hoover was an activist First Lady. She typified the new woman of the post–World War I era: intelligent, robust, and aware of multiple female possibilities.

===Great Depression===
On taking office, Hoover said that &quot;given the chance to go forward with the policies of the last eight years, we shall soon with the help of God, be in sight of the day when poverty will be banished from this nation&quot;. Having seen the fruits of prosperity brought by technological progress, many shared Hoover&#x27;s optimism, and the already bullish stock market climbed even higher on Hoover&#x27;s accession. This optimism concealed several threats to sustained U.S. economic growth, including a persistent farm crisis, a saturation of consumer goods like automobiles, and growing income inequality. Most dangerous of all to the economy was excessive speculation that had raised stock prices far beyond their value. Some regulators and bankers had warned Coolidge and Hoover that a failure to curb speculation would lead to &quot;one of the greatest financial catastrophes that this country has ever seen,&quot; but both presidents were reluctant to become involved with the workings of the Federal Reserve System, which regulated banks.

In late October 1929, the stock market crashed, and the worldwide economy began to spiral downward into the Great Depression. The causes of the Great Depression remain a matter of debate, but Hoover viewed a lack of confidence in the financial system as the fundamental economic problem facing the nation. He sought to avoid direct federal intervention, believing that the best way to bolster the economy was through the strengthening of businesses such as banks and railroads. He also feared that allowing individuals on the &quot;dole&quot; would permanently weaken the country. Instead, Hoover strongly believed that local governments and private giving should address the needs of individuals.

====Early policies====

Though he attempted to put a positive spin on Black Tuesday, Hoover moved quickly to address the stock market collapse. In the days following Black Tuesday, Hoover gathered business and labor leaders, asking them to avoid wage cuts and work stoppages while the country faced what he believed would be a short recession similar to the Depression of 1920–21. Hoover also convinced railroads and public utilities to increase spending on construction and maintenance, and the Federal Reserve announced that it would cut interest rates. In early 1930, Hoover acquired from Congress an additional $100 million to continue the Federal Farm Board lending and purchasing policies. These actions were collectively designed to prevent a cycle of deflation and provide a fiscal stimulus. At the same time, Hoover opposed congressional proposals to provide federal relief to the unemployed, as he believed that such programs were the responsibility of state and local governments and philanthropic organizations.

Hoover had taken office hoping to raise agricultural tariffs in order to help farmers reeling from the farm crisis of the 1920s, but his attempt to raise agricultural tariffs became connected with a bill that broadly raised tariffs. Hoover refused to become closely involved in the congressional debate over the tariff, and Congress produced a tariff bill that raised rates for many goods. Despite the widespread unpopularity of the bill, Hoover felt that he could not reject the main legislative accomplishment of the Republican-controlled 71st Congress. Over the objection of many economists, Hoover signed the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act into law in June 1930. Canada, France, and other nations retaliated by raising tariffs, resulting in a contraction of international trade and a worsening of the economy. Progressive Republicans such as Senator William E. Borah of Idaho were outraged when Hoover signed the tariff act, and Hoover&#x27;s relations with that wing of the party never recovered.

====Later policies====
By the end of 1930, the national unemployment rate had reached 11.9 percent, but it was not yet clear to most Americans that the economic downturn would be worse than the Depression of 1920–21. A series of bank failures in late 1930 heralded a larger collapse of the economy in 1931. While other countries left the gold standard, Hoover refused to abandon it; he derided any other monetary system as &quot;collectivism&quot;. Hoover viewed the weak European economy as a major cause of economic troubles in the United States. In response to the collapse of the German economy, Hoover marshaled congressional support behind a one-year moratorium on European war debts. The Hoover Moratorium was warmly received in Europe and the United States, but Germany remained on the brink of defaulting on its loans. As the worldwide economy worsened, democratic governments fell; in Germany, Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler assumed power and dismantled the Weimar Republic.

By mid-1931, the unemployment rate had reached 15 percent, giving rise to growing fears that the country was experiencing a depression far worse than recent economic downturns. A reserved man with a fear of public speaking, Hoover allowed his opponents in the Democratic Party to define him as cold, incompetent, reactionary, and out-of-touch. Hoover&#x27;s opponents developed defamatory epithets to discredit him, such as &quot;Hooverville&quot; (the shanty towns and homeless encampments), &quot;Hoover leather&quot; (cardboard used to cover holes in the soles of shoes), and &quot;Hoover blanket&quot; (old newspaper used to cover oneself from the cold). While Hoover continued to resist direct federal relief efforts, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York launched the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration to provide aid to the unemployed. Democrats positioned the program as a kinder alternative to Hoover&#x27;s alleged apathy towards the unemployed, despite Hoover&#x27;s belief that such programs were the responsibility of state and local governments.

The economy continued to worsen, with unemployment rates nearing 23 percent in early 1932, and Hoover finally heeded calls for more direct federal intervention. In January 1932, he convinced Congress to authorize the establishment of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which would provide government-secured loans to financial institutions, railroads, and local governments. The RFC saved numerous businesses from failure, but it failed to stimulate commercial lending as much as Hoover had hoped, partly because it was run by conservative bankers unwilling to make riskier loans. The same month the RFC was established, Hoover signed the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, establishing 12 district banks overseen by a Federal Home Loan Bank Board in a manner similar to the Federal Reserve System. He also helped arrange passage of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1932, emergency banking legislation designed to expand banking credit by expanding the collateral on which Federal Reserve banks were authorized to lend. As these measures failed to stem the economic crisis, Hoover signed the Emergency Relief and Construction Act, a $2 billion public works bill, in July 1932.

===Budget policy===
After a decade of budget surpluses, the federal government experienced a budget deficit in 1931. Though some economists, like William Trufant Foster, favored deficit spending to address the Great Depression, most politicians and economists believed in the necessity of keeping a balanced budget. In late 1931, Hoover proposed a tax plan to increase tax revenue by 30 percent, resulting in the passage of the Revenue Act of 1932. The act increased taxes across the board, rolling back much of the tax cut reduction program Mellon had presided over during the 1920s. Top earners were taxed at 63 percent on their net income, the highest rate since the early 1920s. The act also doubled the top estate tax rate, cut personal income tax exemptions, eliminated the corporate income tax exemption, and raised corporate tax rates. Despite the passage of the Revenue Act, the federal government continued to run a budget deficit.

===Civil rights and Mexican Repatriation===
Hoover seldom mentioned civil rights while he was president. He believed that African Americans and other races could improve themselves with education and individual initiative. Hoover appointed more African Americans to federal positions than Harding and Coolidge combined, but many African American leaders condemned various aspects of the Hoover administration, including Hoover&#x27;s unwillingness to push for a federal anti-lynching law. Hoover also continued to pursue the lily-white strategy, removing African Americans from positions of leadership in the Republican Party in an attempt to end the Democratic Party&#x27;s dominance in the South. Though Robert Moton and some other black leaders accepted the lily-white strategy as a temporary measure, most African American leaders were outraged. Hoover further alienated black leaders by nominating conservative Southern judge John J. Parker to the Supreme Court; Parker&#x27;s nomination ultimately failed in the Senate due to opposition from the NAACP and organized labor. Many black voters switched to the Democratic Party in the 1932 election, and African Americans would later become an important part of Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal coalition.

As part of his efforts to limit unemployment, Hoover sought to cut immigration to the United States, and in 1930 he promulgated an executive order requiring individuals to have employment before migrating to the United States. The Hoover Administration began a campaign to prosecute illegal immigrants in the United States, which most strongly affected Mexican Americans, especially those living in Southern California. Many of the deportations were overseen by state and local authorities who acted on the encouragement of the Hoover Administration. During the 1930s, approximately one million Mexican Americans were forcibly &quot;repatriated&quot; to Mexico; approximately sixty percent of those deported were birthright citizens. According to legal professor Kevin R. Johnson, the repatriation campaign meets the modern legal standards of ethnic cleansing, as it involved the forced removal of a racial minority by government actors.

Hoover reorganized the Bureau of Indian Affairs to limit exploitation of Native Americans.

===Prohibition===

On taking office, Hoover urged Americans to obey the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act, which had established Prohibition across the United States. To make public policy recommendations regarding Prohibition, he created the Wickersham Commission. Hoover had hoped that the commission&#x27;s public report would buttress his stance in favor of Prohibition, but the report criticized the enforcement of the Volstead Act and noted the growing public opposition to Prohibition. After the Wickersham Report was published in 1931, Hoover rejected the advice of some of his closest allies and refused to endorse any revision of the Volstead Act or the Eighteenth Amendment, as he feared doing so would undermine his support among Prohibition advocates. As public opinion increasingly turned against Prohibition, more and more people flouted the law, and a grassroots movement began working in earnest for Prohibition&#x27;s repeal. In January 1933, a constitutional amendment repealing the Eighteenth Amendment was approved by Congress and submitted to the states for ratification. By December 1933, it had been ratified by the requisite number of states to become the Twenty-first Amendment.

===Foreign relations===

According to Leuchtenburg, Hoover was &quot;the last American president to take office with no conspicuous need to pay attention to the rest of the world&quot;. Nevertheless, during Hoover&#x27;s term, the world order established in the immediate aftermath of World War I began to crumble. As president, Hoover largely made good on his pledge made prior to assuming office not to interfere in Latin America&#x27;s internal affairs. In 1930, he released the Clark Memorandum, a rejection of the Roosevelt Corollary and a move towards non-interventionism in Latin America. Hoover did not completely refrain from the use of the military in Latin American affairs; he thrice threatened intervention in the Dominican Republic, and he sent warships to El Salvador to support the government against a left-wing revolution. Notwithstanding those actions, he wound down the Banana Wars, ending the occupation of Nicaragua and nearly bringing an end to the occupation of Haiti.

Hoover placed a priority on disarmament, which he hoped would allow the United States to shift money from the military to domestic needs. Hoover and Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson focused on extending the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which sought to prevent a naval arms race. As a result of Hoover&#x27;s efforts, the United States and other major naval powers signed the 1930 London Naval Treaty. The treaty represented the first time that the naval powers had agreed to cap their tonnage of auxiliary vessels, as previous agreements had only affected capital ships.

At the 1932 World Disarmament Conference, Hoover urged further cutbacks in armaments and the outlawing of tanks and bombers, but his proposals were not adopted.

In 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria, defeating the Republic of China&#x27;s National Revolutionary Army and establishing Manchukuo, a puppet state. The Hoover administration deplored the invasion, but also sought to avoid antagonizing the Japanese, fearing that taking too strong a stand would weaken the moderate forces in the Japanese government and alienate a potential ally against the Soviet Union, which he saw as a much greater threat. In response to the Japanese invasion, Hoover and Secretary of State Stimson outlined the Stimson Doctrine, which held that the United States would not recognize territories gained by force.

===Bonus Army===
Thousands of World War I veterans and their families demonstrated and camped out in Washington, DC, during June 1932, calling for immediate payment of bonuses that had been promised by the World War Adjusted Compensation Act in 1924; the terms of the act called for payment of the bonuses in 1945. Although offered money by Congress to return home, some members of the &quot;Bonus Army&quot; remained. Washington police attempted to disperse the demonstrators, but they were outnumbered and unsuccessful. Shots were fired by the police in a futile attempt to attain order, and two protesters were killed while many officers were injured. Hoover sent U.S. Army forces led by General Douglas MacArthur to the protests. MacArthur, believing he was fighting a Communist revolution, chose to clear out the camp with military force. Though Hoover had not ordered MacArthur&#x27;s clearing out of the protesters, he endorsed it after the fact. The incident proved embarrassing for the Hoover administration and hurt his bid for re-election.

===1932 re-election campaign===

By mid-1931 few observers thought that Hoover had much hope of winning a second term in the midst of the ongoing economic crisis. The Republican expectations were so bleak that Hoover faced no serious opposition for re-nomination at the 1932 Republican National Convention. Coolidge and other prominent Republicans all passed on the opportunity to challenge Hoover. Franklin D. Roosevelt won the presidential nomination on the fourth ballot of the 1932 Democratic National Convention, defeating the 1928 Democratic nominee, Al Smith. The Democrats attacked Hoover as the cause of the Great Depression, and for being indifferent to the suffering of millions. As Governor of New York, Roosevelt had called on the New York legislature to provide aid for the needy, establishing Roosevelt&#x27;s reputation for being more favorable toward government interventionism during the economic crisis. The Democratic Party, including Al Smith and other national leaders, coalesced behind Roosevelt, while progressive Republicans like George Norris and Robert La Follette Jr. deserted Hoover. Prohibition was increasingly unpopular and wets offered the argument that states and localities needed the tax money. Hoover proposed a new constitutional amendment that was vague on particulars. Roosevelt&#x27;s platform promised repeal of the 18th Amendment.
Hoover originally planned to make only one or two major speeches and to leave the rest of the campaigning to proxies, as sitting presidents had traditionally done. However, encouraged by Republican pleas and outraged by Democratic claims, Hoover entered the public fray. In his nine major radio addresses Hoover primarily defended his administration and his philosophy of government, urging voters to hold to the &quot;foundations of experience&quot; and reject the notion that government interventionism could save the country from the Depression. Historians contend that his radio speeches were not received well in part due to his monotone, awkward delivery. In his campaign trips around the country, Hoover was faced with perhaps the most hostile crowds ever seen by a sitting president. Besides having his train and motorcades pelted with eggs and rotten fruit, he was often heckled while speaking, and on several occasions, the Secret Service halted attempts to hurt Hoover, including capturing one man nearing Hoover carrying sticks of dynamite, and another already having removed several spikes from the rails in front of the president&#x27;s train. Hoover&#x27;s attempts to vindicate his administration fell on deaf ears, as much of the public blamed his administration for the depression. In the electoral vote, Hoover lost 59–472, carrying six states. Hoover won 39.6 percent of the popular vote, a plunge of 18.6 percentage points from his result in the 1928 election.

==Post-presidency (1933–1964)==
===Roosevelt administration===
====Opposition to the New Deal====
Hoover departed from Washington in March 1933, bitter at his election loss and continuing unpopularity. As Coolidge, Harding, Wilson, and Taft had all died during the 1920s or early 1930s and Roosevelt died in office, Hoover was the sole living former president from 1933 to 1953. He and his wife lived in Palo Alto until her death in 1944, at which point Hoover began to live permanently at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City. During the 1930s, Hoover increasingly self-identified as a conservative. He closely followed national events after leaving public office, becoming a constant critic of Franklin Roosevelt. In response to continued attacks on his character and presidency, Hoover wrote more than two dozen books, including &quot;The Challenge to Liberty&quot; (1934), which harshly criticized Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. Hoover described the New Deal&#x27;s National Recovery Administration and Agricultural Adjustment Administration as &quot;fascistic&quot;, and he called the 1933 Banking Act a &quot;move to gigantic socialism&quot;.

Only 58 when he left office, Hoover held out hope for another term as president throughout the 1930s. At the 1936 Republican National Convention, Hoover&#x27;s speech attacking the New Deal was well received, but the nomination went to Kansas governor Alf Landon. In the general election, Hoover delivered numerous well-publicized speeches on behalf of Landon, but Landon was defeated by Roosevelt. Though Hoover was eager to oppose Roosevelt at every turn, Senator Arthur Vandenberg and other Republicans urged the still-unpopular Hoover to remain out of the fray during the debate over Roosevelt&#x27;s proposed Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937. At the 1940 Republican National Convention, he again hoped for the presidential nomination, but it went to the internationalist Wendell Willkie, who lost to Roosevelt in the general election. Hoover was the last president to seek public office after leaving office until 2022 when Donald Trump announced his successful bid for president in the 2024 presidential election.

====World War II====
During a 1938 trip to Europe, Hoover met with Adolf Hitler and stayed at Hermann Göring&#x27;s hunting lodge. He expressed dismay at the persecution of Jews in Germany and believed that Hitler was mad, but did not present a threat to the U.S. Instead, Hoover believed that Roosevelt posed the biggest threat to peace, holding that Roosevelt&#x27;s policies provoked Japan and discouraged France and the United Kingdom from reaching an &quot;accommodation&quot; with Germany. After the September 1939 invasion of Poland by Germany, Hoover opposed U.S. involvement in World War II, including the Lend-Lease policy. He was active in the isolationist America First Committee. He rejected Roosevelt&#x27;s offers to help coordinate relief in Europe, but, with the help of old friends from the CRB, helped establish the Commission for Polish Relief. After the beginning of the occupation of Belgium in 1940, Hoover provided aid for Belgian civilians, though this aid was described as unnecessary by German broadcasts.

In December 1939, sympathetic Americans led by Hoover formed the Finnish Relief Fund to donate money to aid Finnish civilians and refugees after the Soviet Union had started the Winter War by attacking Finland, which had outraged Americans. By the end of January, it had already sent more than two million dollars to the Finns.

During a radio broadcast on June 29, 1941, one week after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Hoover disparaged any &quot;tacit alliance&quot; between the U.S. and the USSR, stating, &quot;if we join the war and Stalin wins, we have aided him to impose more communism on Europe and the world... War alongside Stalin to impose freedom is more than a travesty. It is a tragedy.&quot; Much to his frustration, Hoover was not called upon to serve after the United States entered World War II due to his differences with Roosevelt and his continuing unpopularity. He did not pursue the presidential nomination at the 1944 Republican National Convention, and, at the request of Republican nominee Thomas E. Dewey, refrained from campaigning during the general election. In 1945, Hoover advised President Harry S. Truman to drop the United States&#x27; demand for the unconditional surrender of Japan because of the high projected casualties of the planned invasion of Japan, although Hoover was unaware of the Manhattan Project and the atomic bomb.

In 1943, Hoover expressed his support for Zionism.

===Post-World War II===

Following World War II, Hoover befriended President Truman despite their ideological differences. Because of Hoover&#x27;s experience with Germany at the end of World War I, in 1946 Truman selected the former president to tour Allied-occupied Germany and Rome, Italy to ascertain the food needs of the occupied nations. After touring Germany, Hoover produced a number of reports critical of U.S. occupation policy. He stated in one report that &quot;there is the illusion that the New Germany left after the annexations can be reduced to a &#x27;pastoral state.&#x27; It cannot be done unless we exterminate or move 25,000,000 people out of it.&quot; On Hoover&#x27;s initiative, a school meals program in the American and British occupation zones of Germany was begun on April 14, 1947; the program served 3,500,000 children.

Even more important, in 1947 Truman appointed Hoover to lead the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government a new high level study. Truman accepted some of the recommendations of the &quot;Hoover Commission&quot; for eliminating waste, fraud, and inefficiency, consolidating agencies, and strengthening White House control of policy. Though Hoover had opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s concentration of power in the 1930s, he believed that a stronger presidency was required with the advent of the Atomic Age. During the 1948 presidential election, Hoover supported Republican nominee Thomas E. Dewey&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign against Truman, but he remained on good terms with Truman. Hoover favored the United Nations in principle, but he opposed granting membership to the Soviet Union and other Communist states. He viewed the Soviet Union to be as morally repugnant as Nazi Germany and supported the efforts of Richard Nixon and others to expose Communists in the United States.

In 1949, Dewey, as governor of New York, offered Hoover the Senate seat vacated by Robert F. Wagner. It was a matter of being senator for only two months and he declined.

Hoover backed conservative leader Robert A. Taft at the 1952 Republican National Convention, but the party&#x27;s presidential nomination instead went to Dwight D. Eisenhower, who went on to win the 1952 election. Though Eisenhower appointed Hoover to another presidential commission, Hoover disliked Eisenhower, faulting the latter&#x27;s failure to roll back the New Deal. Hoover&#x27;s public work helped to rehabilitate his reputation, as did his use of self-deprecating humor; he occasionally remarked that &quot;I am the only person of distinction who&#x27;s ever had a depression named after him.&quot; In 1958, Congress passed the Former Presidents Act, offering a $25,000 yearly pension () to each former president. Hoover took the pension even though he did not need the money, possibly to avoid embarrassing Truman, whose allegedly precarious financial status played a role in the law&#x27;s enactment. In the early 1960s, President John F. Kennedy offered Hoover various positions; Hoover declined the offers but defended the Kennedy administration after the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Cuban Missile Crisis and was personally distraught by Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in 1963.

Hoover wrote several books during his retirement, including &quot;The Ordeal of Woodrow Wilson&quot;, in which he strongly defended Wilson&#x27;s actions at the Paris Peace Conference. In 1944, he began working on &quot;Freedom Betrayed&quot;, which he often referred to as his &quot;magnum opus&quot;. In &quot;Freedom Betrayed&quot;, Hoover strongly critiques Roosevelt&#x27;s foreign policy, especially Roosevelt&#x27;s decision to recognize the Soviet Union in order to provide aid to that country during World War II. The book was published in 2012 after being edited by historian George H. Nash.

===Death===
Hoover faced three major illnesses during the last two years of his life, including an August 1962 operation in which a growth on his large intestine was removed. He died in New York City on October 20, 1964, following massive internal bleeding. Though Hoover&#x27;s last spoken words are unknown, his last-known written words were a get-well message to his friend former President Harry S. Truman, six days before his death, after he heard that Truman had sustained injuries from slipping in a bathroom: Two months earlier on August 10, Hoover reached the age of 90, only the second U.S. president (after John Adams) to do so. When asked how he felt on reaching the milestone, Hoover replied, &quot;Too old.&quot; At the time of his death, Hoover had been out of office for over 31 years ( days all together). This was the longest retirement in presidential history, surpassing Adams&#x27; 25 years, until Jimmy Carter broke that record in September 2012.

President Lyndon Johnson ordered flags flown at half-staff and was among the 500 guests invited for the funeral service held at St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Other dignitaries included former Vice President Nixon, Representative William E. Miller, Governor Nelson Rockefeller, former Governor Thomas E. Dewey, former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, former Postmaster General James A. Farley, Rear Admiral Lewis L. Strauss and Senators Hubert H. Humphrey, Barry Goldwater, Kenneth Keating, and Jacob Javits. 

Hoover was honored with a state funeral in which he lay in state in the United States Capitol rotunda. President Johnson and First Lady Lady Bird Johnson attended, but former presidents Truman and Eisenhower were both too ill to attend. Then, on October 25, he was buried in West Branch, Iowa, near his presidential library and birthplace on the grounds of the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site. Afterwards, Hoover&#x27;s wife, Lou Henry Hoover, who had been buried in Palo Alto, California, following her death in 1944, was re-interred beside him. Hoover was the last surviving member of the Harding and Coolidge cabinets. John Nance Garner (the speaker of the House during the second half of Hoover&#x27;s term) was the only person in Hoover&#x27;s United States presidential line of succession he did not outlive.

The state funeral was the third in a span of twelve months, following those of President John F. Kennedy and General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. Black Jack was the riderless horse in all three funerals.

==Legacy==

===Historical reputation===
Hoover was extremely unpopular when he left office after the 1932 election, and his historical reputation would not begin to recover until the 1970s. According to Professor David E. Hamilton, historians have credited Hoover for his genuine belief in voluntarism and cooperation, as well as the innovation of some of his programs. However, Hamilton also notes that Hoover was politically inept and failed to recognize the severity of the Great Depression. Nicholas Lemann writes that Hoover has been remembered &quot;as the man who was too rigidly conservative to react adeptly to the Depression, as the hapless foil to the great Franklin Roosevelt, and as the politician who managed to turn a Republican country into a Democratic one&quot;. Polls of historians and political scientists have generally ranked Hoover in the bottom third of presidents. A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association&#x27;s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Hoover as the 36th best president. A 2017 C-SPAN poll of historians also ranked Hoover as the 36th best president.

Although Hoover is generally regarded as having had a failed presidency, he has also received praise for his actions as a humanitarian and public official. Biographer Glen Jeansonne writes that Hoover was &quot;one of the most extraordinary Americans of modern times,&quot; adding that Hoover &quot;led a life that was a prototypical Horatio Alger story, except that Horatio Alger stories stop at the pinnacle of success&quot;. Biographer Kenneth Whyte writes that, &quot;the question of where Hoover belongs in the American political tradition remains a loaded one to this day. While he clearly played important roles in the development of both the progressive and conservative traditions, neither side will embrace him for fear of contamination with the other.&quot;

Historian Richard Pipes, on his actions leading the American Relief Administration, said of him: &quot;Many statesmen occupy a prominent place in history for having sent millions to their death; Herbert Hoover, maligned for his performance as President, and soon forgotten in Russia, has the rare distinction of having saved millions.&quot;

===Views of race===
Although racist remarks and humor were common at the time, Hoover never indulged in them while president, and deliberate discrimination was anathema to him. Like many of his peers, Hoover considered white people to be inherently superior to black people, considering the &quot;mixture of bloods disadvantageous&quot;. He did think education and work would improve black people&#x27;s standing, hence his support for the Tuskegee Institute. His wife Lou Henry Hoover broke the color bar as first lady by inviting Jessie De Priest, wife of the first black congressman elected in several decades, to a traditional tea for the wives of congressmen, as well as later inviting the Tuskegee Institute choir (then under the direction of William Dawson).

Although he thought of himself as a friend to black people and an advocate for their progress, many of his black contemporaries had a different view. W. E. B. Du Bois described him as an &quot;undemocratic racist who saw blacks as a species of &#x27;sub-men. Some historians trace the disaffection of African-Americans with the Republican party to his time in office especially due to his attempt to remove African-Americans from leadership in the Republican party in the South.

Hoover&#x27;s time in China shaped his views of Asian people and Asian-Americans. He erroneously wrote that &quot;no world-startling mechanical invention&quot; had come from China, claiming this was due to Chinese people not possessing the same mechanical instincts as Europeans. This may have influenced his decision to reduce immigration through restrictions on visas.

===Memorials===
The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum is located in West Branch, Iowa next to the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site. The library is one of thirteen presidential libraries run by the National Archives and Records Administration. The Hoover–Minthorn House, where Hoover lived from 1885 to 1891, is located in Newberg, Oregon. His Rapidan fishing camp in Virginia, which he donated to the government in 1933, is now a National Historic Landmark within the Shenandoah National Park. The Lou Henry and Herbert Hoover House, built in 1919 in Stanford, California, is now the official residence of the president of Stanford University, and a National Historic Landmark. Also located at Stanford is the Hoover Institution, a think tank and research institution started by Hoover.

Hoover has been memorialized in the names of several things, including the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River and numerous elementary, middle, and high schools across the United States. Two minor planets, 932 Hooveria and 1363 Herberta, are named in his honor. The Polish capital of Warsaw has a square named after Hoover, and the historic townsite of Gwalia, Western Australia contains the Hoover House Bed and Breakfast, where Hoover resided while managing and visiting the mine during the first decade of the twentieth century. A medicine ball game known as Hooverball is named for Hoover; it was invented by White House physician Admiral Joel T. Boone to help Hoover keep fit while serving as president.

===Other honors===

Hoover was inducted into the National Mining Hall of Fame in 1988 (inaugural class). His wife was inducted into the hall in 1990.

Hoover was inducted into the Australian Prospectors and Miners&#x27; Hall of Fame in the category Directors and Management.

Hoover was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Charles University in Prague and University of Helsinki in March 1938. The ceremonial sword is today on display in the lobby of the Hoover tower.

<text>Hildegard of Bingen OSB (, ; ; 17 September 1179), also known as the Sibyl of the Rhine, was a German Benedictine abbess and polymath active as a writer, composer, philosopher, mystic, visionary, and as a medical writer and practitioner during the High Middle Ages. She is one of the best-known composers of sacred monophony, as well as the most recorded in modern history. She has been considered by a number of scholars to be the founder of scientific natural history in Germany.

Hildegard&#x27;s convent at Disibodenberg elected her as (mother superior) in 1136. She founded the monasteries of Rupertsberg in 1150 and Eibingen in 1165. Hildegard wrote theological, botanical, and medicinal works, as well as letters, hymns, and antiphons for the liturgy. She wrote poems, and supervised miniature illuminations in the Rupertsberg manuscript of her first work, . There are more surviving chants by Hildegard than by any other composer from the entire Middle Ages, and she is one of the few known composers to have written both the music and the words. One of her works, the , is an early example of liturgical drama and arguably the oldest surviving morality play. She is noted for the invention of a constructed language known as .

Although the history of her formal canonization is complicated, regional calendars of the Catholic Church have listed her as a saint for centuries. On 10 May 2012, Pope Benedict XVI extended the liturgical cult of Hildegard to the entire Catholic Church in a process known as &quot;equivalent canonization&quot;. On 7 October 2012, he named her a Doctor of the Church, in recognition of &quot;her holiness of life and the originality of her teaching.&quot;

==Biography==

Hildegard was born around 1098. Her parents were Mechtild of Merxheim-Nahet and Hildebert of Bermersheim, a family of the free lower nobility in the service of the Count Meginhard of Sponheim. Sickly from birth, Hildegard is traditionally considered their youngest and tenth child, although there are records of only seven older siblings. In her , Hildegard states that from a very young age she experienced visions.

===Spirituality===
From early childhood, long before she undertook her public mission or even her monastic vows, Hildegard&#x27;s spiritual awareness was grounded in what she called the , the reflection of the living Light. Her letter to Guibert of Gembloux, which she wrote at the age of 77, describes her experience of this light:

===Monastic life===
Perhaps because of Hildegard&#x27;s visions or as a method of political positioning, or both, Hildegard&#x27;s parents offered her as an oblate to the Benedictine monastery at Disibodenberg, which had been recently reformed in the Palatinate Forest. The date of Hildegard&#x27;s enclosure at the monastery is the subject of debate. Her says she was eight years old when she was professed with Jutta, who was the daughter of Count Stephan II of Sponheim and about six years older than Hildegard. Jutta&#x27;s date of enclosure is known to have been in 1112, when Hildegard would have been 14. Their vows were received by Bishop Otto of Bamberg on All Saints Day 1112. Some scholars speculate that Hildegard was placed in the care of Jutta at the age of eight, and that the two of them were then enclosed together six years later.

In any case, Hildegard and Jutta were enclosed together at Disibodenberg and formed the core of a growing community of women attached to the monastery of monks, named a &quot;Frauenklause,&quot; a type of female hermitage. Jutta was also a visionary and thus attracted many followers who came to visit her at the monastery. Hildegard states that Jutta taught her to read and write, but that she was unlearned, and therefore incapable of teaching Hildegard sound Biblical interpretation. The written record of the &quot;Life of Jutta&quot; indicates that Hildegard probably assisted her in reciting the psalms, working in the garden, other handiwork, and tending to the sick. This might have been a time when Hildegard learned how to play the ten-stringed psaltery. Volmar, a frequent visitor, may have taught Hildegard simple psalm notation. The time she studied music could have been the beginning of the compositions she would later create.

Upon Jutta&#x27;s death in 1136, Hildegard was unanimously elected as of the community by her fellow nuns. Abbot Kuno of Disibodenberg asked Hildegard to be prioress, which would be under his authority. Hildegard wanted more independence for herself and her nuns and asked Abbot Kuno to allow them to move to Rupertsberg. This was to be a move toward poverty, from a stone complex that was well established to a temporary dwelling place. When the abbot declined Hildegard&#x27;s proposition, Hildegard went over his head and received the approval of Archbishop Henry I of Mainz. Abbot Kuno did not relent, however, until Hildegard was stricken by an illness that rendered her paralyzed and unable to move from her bed, an event that she attributed to God&#x27;s unhappiness at her not following his orders to move her nuns to Rupertsberg. It was only when the Abbot himself could not move Hildegard that he decided to grant the nuns their own monastery. Hildegard and approximately 20 nuns thus moved to the St. Rupertsberg monastery in 1150, where Volmar served as provost, as well as Hildegard&#x27;s confessor and scribe. In 1165, Hildegard founded a second monastery for her nuns at Eibingen.

Before Hildegard&#x27;s death in 1179, a problem arose with the clergy of Mainz: a man buried in Rupertsberg had died after excommunication from the Catholic Church. Therefore, the clergy wanted to remove his body from the sacred ground. Hildegard did not accept this idea, replying that it was a sin and that the man had been reconciled to the church at the time of his death.

===Visions===

Hildegard said that she first saw &quot;The Shade of the Living Light&quot; at the age of three, and by the age of five, she began to understand that she was experiencing visions. She used the term (Latin for &#x27;vision&#x27;) to describe this feature of her experience and she recognized that it was a gift that she could not explain to others. Hildegard explained that she saw all things in the light of God through the five senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. Hildegard was hesitant to share her visions, confiding only to Jutta, who in turn told Volmar, Hildegard&#x27;s tutor and, later, secretary. Throughout her life, she continued to have many visions, and in 1141, at the age of 42, Hildegard received a vision she believed to be an instruction from God, to &quot;write down that which you see and hear.&quot; Still hesitant to record her visions, Hildegard became physically ill. The illustrations recorded in the book of were visions that Hildegard experienced, causing her great suffering and tribulations. In her first theological text, (&quot;Know the Ways&quot;), Hildegard describes her struggle within:

It was between November 1147 and February 1148 at the synod in Trier that Pope Eugenius heard about Hildegard&#x27;s writings. It was from this that she received Papal approval to document her visions as revelations from the Holy Spirit, giving her instant credence.

On 17 September 1179, when Hildegard died, her sisters claimed they saw two streams of light appear in the skies and cross over the room where she was dying.

Hildegard&#x27;s hagiography, , was compiled by the monk Theoderic of Echternach after Hildegard&#x27;s death. He included the hagiographical work , or &quot;Little Book&quot;, begun by Godfrey of Disibodenberg. Godfrey had died before he was able to complete his work. Guibert of Gembloux was invited to finish the work; however, he had to return to his monastery with the project unfinished. Theoderic utilized sources Guibert had left behind to complete the .

==Works==

Hildegard&#x27;s works include three great volumes of visionary theology; a variety of musical compositions for use in the liturgy, as well as the musical morality play ; one of the largest bodies of letters (nearly 400) to survive from the Middle Ages, addressed to correspondents ranging from popes to emperors to abbots and abbesses, and including records of many of the sermons she preached in the 1160s and 1170s; two volumes of material on natural medicine and cures; an invented language called the (&#x27;unknown language&#x27;); and various minor works, including a gospel commentary and two works of hagiography.

Several manuscripts of her works were produced during her lifetime, including the illustrated Rupertsberg manuscript of her first major work, ; the Dendermonde Codex, which contains one version of her musical works; and the Ghent manuscript, which was the first fair-copy made for editing of her final theological work, the . At the end of her life, and probably under her initial guidance, all of her works were edited and gathered into the single Riesenkodex manuscript. The Riesenkodex manuscript is a collection of 481 folios of vellum bound in pig leather over wooden boards that measure .

===Visionary theology===
Hildegard&#x27;s most significant works were her three volumes of visionary theology: (&quot;Know the Ways&quot;, composed 1142–1151), (&quot;Book of Life&#x27;s Merits&quot; or &quot;Book of the Rewards of Life&quot;, composed 1158–1163); and (&quot;Book of Divine Works&quot;, also known as , &quot;On God&#x27;s Activity&quot;, begun around 1163 or 1164 and completed around 1172 or 1174). In these volumes, the last of which was completed when she was well into her seventies, Hildegard first describes each vision, whose details are often strange and enigmatic, and then interprets their theological contents in the words of the &quot;voice of the Living Light.&quot;


With permission from Abbot Kuno of Disibodenberg, she began journaling visions she had (which is the basis for ). is a contraction of (&#x27;Know the Ways of the Lord&#x27;), and it was Hildegard&#x27;s first major visionary work, and one of the biggest milestones in her life. Perceiving a divine command to &quot;write down what you see and hear,&quot; Hildegard began to record and interpret her visionary experiences. In total, 26 visionary experiences were captured in this compilation.

 is structured into three parts of unequal length. The first part (six visions) chronicles the order of God&#x27;s creation: the Creation and Fall of Adam and Eve, the structure of the universe (described as the shape of an &quot;egg&quot;), the relationship between body and soul, God&#x27;s relationship to his people through the Synagogue, and the choirs of angels. The second part (seven visions) describes the order of redemption: the coming of Christ the Redeemer, the Trinity, the church as the Bride of Christ and the Mother of the Faithful in baptism and confirmation, the orders of the church, Christ&#x27;s sacrifice on the cross and the Eucharist, and the fight against the devil. Finally, the third part (thirteen visions) recapitulates the history of salvation told in the first two parts, symbolized as a building adorned with various allegorical figures and virtues. It concludes with the Symphony of Heaven, an early version of Hildegard&#x27;s musical compositions.

In early 1148, a commission was sent by the Pope to Disibodenberg to find out more about Hildegard and her writings. The commission found that the visions were authentic and returned to the Pope, with a portion of the . Portions of the uncompleted work were read aloud to Pope Eugenius III at the Synod of Trier in 1148, after which he sent Hildegard a letter with his blessing. This blessing was later construed as papal approval for all of Hildegard&#x27;s wide-ranging theological activities. Towards the end of her life, Hildegard commissioned a richly decorated manuscript of (the Rupertsberg Codex); although the original has been lost since its evacuation to Dresden for safekeeping in 1945, its images are preserved in a hand-painted facsimile from the 1920s.
In her second volume of visionary theology, , composed between 1158 and 1163, after she had moved her community of nuns into independence at the Rupertsberg in Bingen, Hildegard tackled the moral life in the form of dramatic confrontations between the virtues and the vices. She had already explored this area in her musical morality play, , and the &quot;Book of the Rewards of Life&quot; takes up the play&#x27;s characteristic themes. Each vice, although ultimately depicted as ugly and grotesque, nevertheless offers alluring, seductive speeches that attempt to entice the unwary soul into their clutches. Standing in humankind&#x27;s defence, however, are the sober voices of the Virtues, powerfully confronting every vicious deception.

Amongst the work&#x27;s innovations is one of the earliest descriptions of purgatory as the place where each soul would have to work off its debts after death before entering heaven. Hildegard&#x27;s descriptions of the possible punishments there are often gruesome and grotesque, which emphasize the work&#x27;s moral and pastoral purpose as a practical guide to the life of true penance and proper virtue.

Hildegard&#x27;s last and grandest visionary work, , had its genesis in one of the few times she experienced something like an ecstatic loss of consciousness. As she described it in an autobiographical passage included in her , sometime in about 1163, she received &quot;an extraordinary mystical vision&quot; in which was revealed the &quot;sprinkling drops of sweet rain&quot; that she stated John the Evangelist experienced when he wrote, &quot;In the beginning was the Word&quot; (John 1:1). Hildegard perceived that this Word was the key to the &quot;Work of God&quot;, of which humankind is the pinnacle. The &quot;Book of Divine Works&quot;, therefore, became in many ways an extended explication of the prologue to the Gospel of John.

The ten visions of this work&#x27;s three parts are cosmic in scale, to illustrate various ways of understanding the relationship between God and his creation. Often, that relationship is established by grand allegorical female figures representing Divine Love () or Wisdom (). The first vision opens the work with a salvo of poetic and visionary images, swirling about to characterize God&#x27;s dynamic activity within the scope of his work within the history of salvation. The remaining three visions of the first part introduce the image of a human being standing astride the spheres that make up the universe and detail the intricate relationships between the human as microcosm and the universe as macrocosm. This culminates in the final chapter of Part One, Vision Four with Hildegard&#x27;s commentary on the prologue to the Gospel of John (John 1:1–14), a direct rumination on the meaning of &quot;In the beginning was the Word&quot;. The single vision that constitutes the whole of Part Two stretches that rumination back to the opening of Genesis, and forms an extended commentary on the seven days of the creation of the world told in Genesis 1–2:3. This commentary interprets each day of creation in three ways: literal or cosmological; allegorical or ecclesiological (i.e. related to the church&#x27;s history); and moral or tropological (i.e. related to the soul&#x27;s growth in virtue). Finally, the five visions of the third part take up again the building imagery of to describe the course of salvation history. The final vision (3.5) contains Hildegard&#x27;s longest and most detailed prophetic program of the life of the church from her own days of &quot;womanish weakness&quot; through to the coming and ultimate downfall of the Antichrist.

===Music===
Attention in recent decades to women of the medieval Catholic Church has led to a great deal of popular interest in Hildegard&#x27;s music. In addition to the , 69 musical compositions, each with its own original poetic text, survive, and at least four other texts are known, though their musical notation has been lost. This is one of the largest repertoires among medieval composers.
One of her better-known works, (&quot;Play of the Virtues&quot;), is a morality play. It is uncertain when some of Hildegard&#x27;s compositions were composed, though the is thought to have been composed as early as 1151. It is an independent Latin morality play with music (82 songs); it does not supplement or pay homage to the Mass or the Office of a certain feast. It is, in fact, the earliest known surviving musical drama that is not attached to a liturgy.

The would have been performed within Hildegard&#x27;s monastery by and for her select community of noblewomen and nuns. It was probably performed as a manifestation of the theology Hildegard delineated in the . The play serves as an allegory of the Christian story of sin, confession, repentance, and forgiveness. Notably, it is the female Virtues who restore the fallen to the community of the faithful, not the male Patriarchs or Prophets. This would have been a significant message to the nuns in Hildegard&#x27;s convent. Scholars assert that the role of the Devil would have been played by Volmar, while Hildegard&#x27;s nuns would have played the parts of Anima (the human souls) and the Virtues. The devil&#x27;s part is entirely spoken or shouted, with no musical setting. All other characters sing in monophonic plainchant. This includes patriarchs, prophets, a happy soul, an unhappy soul, and a penitent soul along with 16 virtues (including mercy, innocence, chastity, obedience, hope, and faith).

In addition to the , Hildegard composed many liturgical songs that were collected into a cycle called the . The songs from the Symphonia are set to Hildegard&#x27;s own text and range from antiphons, hymns, and sequences (such as &quot;Columba Aspexit&quot;), to responsories. Her music is monophonic, consisting of exactly one melodic line. Its style has been said to be characterized by soaring melodies that can push the boundaries of traditional Gregorian chant and to stand outside the normal practices of monophonic monastic chant. Researchers are also exploring ways in which it may be viewed in comparison with her contemporaries, such as Hermannus Contractus. Another feature of Hildegard&#x27;s music that both reflects the 12th-century evolution of chant, and pushes that evolution further, is that it is highly melismatic, often with recurrent melodic units. Scholars such as Margot Fassler, Marianne Richert Pfau, and Beverly Lomer also note the intimate relationship between music and text in Hildegard&#x27;s compositions, whose rhetorical features are often more distinct than is common in 12th-century chant. As with most medieval chant notation, Hildegard&#x27;s music lacks any indication of tempo or rhythm; the surviving manuscripts employ late German style notation, which uses very ornamental neumes. The reverence for the Virgin Mary reflected in music shows how deeply influenced and inspired Hildegard of Bingen and her community were by the Virgin Mary and the saints.

===Scientific and medicinal writings===

Hildegard&#x27;s medicinal and scientific writings, although thematically complementary to her ideas about nature expressed in her visionary works, are different in focus and scope. Neither claim to be rooted in her visionary experience and its divine authority. Rather, they spring from her experience helping in and then leading the monastery&#x27;s herbal garden and infirmary, as well as the theoretical information she likely gained through her wide-ranging reading in the monastery&#x27;s library. As she gained practical skills in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, she combined physical treatment of physical diseases with holistic methods centered on &quot;spiritual healing&quot;. She became well known for her healing powers involving the practical application of tinctures, herbs, and precious stones. She combined these elements with a theological notion ultimately derived from Genesis: all things put on earth are for the use of humans. In addition to her hands-on experience, she also gained medical knowledge, including elements of her humoral theory, from traditional Latin texts.

Hildegard catalogued both her theory and practice in two works. The first, , contains nine books that describe the scientific and medicinal properties of various plants, stones, fish, reptiles, and animals. This document is also thought to contain the first recorded reference of the use of hops in beer as a preservative. The second, , is an exploration of the human body, its connections to the rest of the natural world, and the causes and cures of various diseases. Hildegard documented various medical practices in these books, including the use of bleeding and home remedies for many common ailments. She also explains remedies for common agricultural injuries such as burns, fractures, dislocations, and cuts. Hildegard may have used the books to teach assistants at the monastery. These books are historically significant because they show areas of medieval medicine that were not well documented because their practitioners, mainly women, rarely wrote in Latin. Her writings were commentated on by Mélanie Lipinska, a Polish scientist.

In addition to its wealth of practical evidence, is also noteworthy for its organizational scheme. Its first part sets the work within the context of the creation of the cosmos and then humanity as its summit, and the constant interplay of the human person as microcosm both physically and spiritually with the macrocosm of the universe informs all of Hildegard&#x27;s approach. Her hallmark is to emphasize the vital connection between the &quot;green&quot; health of the natural world and the holistic health of the human person. , or greening power, was thought to sustain human beings and could be manipulated by adjusting the balance of elements within a person. Thus, when she approached medicine as a type of gardening, it was not just as an analogy. Rather, Hildegard understood the plants and elements of the garden as direct counterparts to the humors and elements within the human body, whose imbalance led to illness and disease.

The nearly three hundred chapters of the second book of &quot;explore the etiology, or causes, of disease as well as human sexuality, psychology, and physiology.&quot; In this section, she gives specific instructions for bleeding based on various factors, including gender, the phase of the moon (bleeding is best done when the moon is waning), the place of disease (use veins near diseased organ or body part) or prevention (big veins in arms), and how much blood to take (described in imprecise measurements, like &quot;the amount that a thirsty person can swallow in one gulp&quot;). She even includes bleeding instructions for animals to keep them healthy. In the third and fourth sections, Hildegard describes treatments for malignant and minor problems and diseases according to the humoral theory, again including information on animal health. The fifth section is about diagnosis and prognosis, which includes instructions to check the patient&#x27;s blood, pulse, urine, and stool. Finally, the sixth section documents a lunar horoscope to provide an additional means of prognosis for both disease and other medical conditions, such as conception and the outcome of pregnancy. For example, she indicates that a waxing moon is good for human conception and is also good for sowing seeds for plants (sowing seeds is the plant equivalent of conception). Elsewhere, Hildegard is even said to have stressed the value of boiling drinking water in an attempt to prevent infection.

As Hildegard elaborates the medical and scientific relationship between the human microcosm and the macrocosm of the universe, she often focuses on interrelated patterns of four: &quot;the four elements (fire, air, water, and earth), the four seasons, the four humors, the four zones of the earth, and the four major winds.&quot; Although she inherited the basic framework of humoral theory from ancient medicine, Hildegard&#x27;s conception of the hierarchical inter-balance of the four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) was unique, based on their correspondence to &quot;superior&quot; and &quot;inferior&quot; elements – blood and phlegm corresponding to the &quot;celestial&quot; elements of fire and air, and the two biles corresponding to the &quot;terrestrial&quot; elements of water and earth. Hildegard understood the disease-causing imbalance of these humors to result from the improper dominance of the subordinate humors. This disharmony reflects that introduced by Adam and Eve in the Fall, which for Hildegard marked the indelible entrance of disease and humoral imbalance into humankind. As she writes in c. 42:

=== and ===
Hildegard also invented an alternative alphabet. (&#x27;Alternate Alphabet&#x27;) was another work and was more or less a secret code, or even an intellectual code – much like a modern crossword puzzle today.

Hildegard&#x27;s (&#x27;unknown language&#x27;) consisted of a series of invented words that corresponded to an eclectic list of nouns. The list is approximately 1,000 nouns; there are no other parts of speech. The two most important sources for the are the Wiesbaden, Hessische Landesbibliothek 2 (nicknamed the Riesenkodex) and the Berlin manuscript. In both manuscripts, medieval German and Latin glosses are written above Hildegard&#x27;s invented words. The Berlin manuscript contains additional Latin and German glosses not found in the Riesenkodex. The first two words of the as copied in the Berlin manuscript are &quot;aigonz&quot; (German, ; Latin, ; English, &quot;god&quot;) and &quot;aleganz&quot; (German, ; Latin, ; English, &quot;angel&quot;).&quot;

Barbara Newman believes that Hildegard used her to increase solidarity among her nuns. Sarah Higley disagrees and notes that there is no evidence of Hildegard teaching the language to her nuns. She suggests that the language was not intended to remain a secret; rather, the presence of words for mundane things may indicate that the language was for the whole abbey and perhaps the larger monastic world. Higley believes that &quot;the Lingua is a linguistic distillation of the philosophy expressed in her three prophetic books: it represents the cosmos of divine and human creation and the sins that flesh is heir to.&quot;

The text of her writing and compositions reveals Hildegard&#x27;s use of this form of modified medieval Latin, encompassing many invented, conflated, and abridged words. Because of her inventions of words for her lyrics and use of a constructed script, many conlangers look upon her as a medieval precursor.

==Significance==

===During her lifetime===
Maddocks claims that it is likely Hildegard learned simple Latin and the tenets of the Christian faith, but was not instructed in the Seven Liberal Arts, which formed the basis of all education for the learned classes in the Middle Ages: the of grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric plus the of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. The correspondence she kept with the outside world, both spiritual and social, transcended the cloister as a space of spiritual confinement and served to document Hildegard&#x27;s grand style and strict formatting of medieval letter writing.

Contributing to Christian European rhetorical traditions, Hildegard &quot;authorized herself as a theologian&quot; through alternative rhetorical arts. Hildegard was creative in her interpretation of theology. She believed that her monastery should exclude novices who were not from the nobility because she did not want her community to be divided on the basis of social status. She also stated that &quot;woman may be made from man, but no man can be made without a woman.&quot;
Because of church limitation on public, discursive rhetoric, the medieval rhetorical arts included preaching, letter writing, poetry, and the encyclopedic tradition. Hildegard&#x27;s participation in these arts speaks to her significance as a female rhetorician, transcending bans on women&#x27;s social participation and interpretation of scripture. The acceptance of public preaching by a woman, even a well-connected abbess and acknowledged prophet, does not fit the stereotype of this time. Her preaching was not limited to the monasteries; she preached publicly in 1160 in Germany. She conducted four preaching tours throughout Germany, speaking to both clergy and laity in chapter houses and in public, mainly denouncing clerical corruption and calling for reform.

Many abbots and abbesses asked her for prayers and opinions on various matters. She traveled widely during her four preaching tours. She had several devoted followers, including Guibert of Gembloux, who wrote to her frequently and became her secretary after Volmar&#x27;s death in 1173. Hildegard also influenced several monastic women, exchanging letters with Elisabeth of Schönau, a nearby visionary.

Hildegard corresponded with popes such as Eugene III and Anastasius IV, statesmen such as Abbot Suger, German emperors such as Frederick I Barbarossa, and other notable figures such as Bernard of Clairvaux, who advanced her work, at the behest of her abbot, Kuno, at the Synod of Trier in 1147 and 1148. Hildegard of Bingen&#x27;s correspondence is an important component of her literary output.

===Veneration===
Hildegard was one of the first persons for whom the Roman canonization process was officially applied, but the process took so long that four attempts at canonization were not completed and she remained at the level of her beatification. Her name was nonetheless included in the Roman Martyrology at the end of the 16th century up to the current 2004 edition, listing her as &quot;Saint Hildegard&quot; with her feast on 17 September, which would eventually be added to the General Roman Calendar as an optional memorial. Numerous popes have referred to Hildegard as a saint, including Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. Hildegard&#x27;s pilgrimage church in Eibingen houses her relics.

On 10 May 2012, Pope Benedict XVI extended the veneration of Saint Hildegard to the entire Catholic Church in a process known as &quot;equivalent canonization,&quot; thus laying the groundwork for naming her a Doctor of the Church. On 7 October 2012, the feast of the Holy Rosary, the pope named her a Doctor of the Church. He called Hildegard &quot;perennially relevant&quot; and &quot;an authentic teacher of theology and a profound scholar of natural science and music.&quot;

Hildegard of Bingen also appears in the calendar of saints of various Anglican churches, such as that of the Church of England, in which she is commemorated on 17 September.

===Modern interest===
In recent years, Hildegard has become of particular interest to feminist scholars. They note her reference to herself as a member of the weaker sex and her rather constant belittling of women. Hildegard frequently referred to herself as an unlearned woman, completely incapable of Biblical exegesis. Such a statement on her part, however, worked slyly to her advantage because it made her statements that all of her writings and music came from visions of the Divine more believable, therefore giving Hildegard the authority to speak in a time and place where few women were permitted a voice. Hildegard used her voice to amplify the church&#x27;s condemnation of institutional corruption, in particular simony.

Hildegard has also become a figure of reverence within the contemporary New Age movement, mostly because of her holistic and natural view of healing, as well as her status as a mystic. Although her medical writings were long neglected and then, studied without reference to their context, she was the inspiration for Dr. Gottfried Hertzka&#x27;s &quot;Hildegard-Medicine&quot;, and is the namesake for June Boyce-Tillman&#x27;s Hildegard Network, a healing center that focuses on a holistic approach to wellness and brings together people interested in exploring the links between spirituality, the arts, and healing. Her reputation as a medicinal writer and healer was also used by early feminists to argue for women&#x27;s rights to attend medical schools.

Reincarnation of Hildegard has been debated since 1924 when Austrian mystic Rudolf Steiner lectured that a nun of her description was the past life of Russian poet-philosopher Vladimir Soloviev, whose visions of Holy Wisdom are often compared to Hildegard&#x27;s. Sophiologist Robert Powell writes that hermetic astrology proves the match, while mystical communities in Hildegard&#x27;s lineage include that of artist Carl Schroeder as studied by Columbia sociologist Courtney Bender and supported by reincarnation researchers Walter Semkiw and Kevin Ryerson.

Recordings and performances of Hildegard&#x27;s music have gained critical praise and popularity since 1979. There is an extensive discography of her musical works.

In space, the minor planet 898 Hildegard is named for her.

Hildegard was the subject of a 2012 fictionalized biographic novel &quot;Illuminations&quot; by Mary Sharatt.

The plant genus &quot;Hildegardia&quot; is named after her because of her contributions to herbal medicine.

The off-Broadway musical &quot;In the Green&quot;, written by Grace McLean, followed Hildegard&#x27;s story.

In his book, &quot;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&quot;, neurologist Oliver Sacks devotes a chapter to Hildegard and concludes that in his opinion her visions were migrainous.

In film, Hildegard has been portrayed by Patricia Routledge in a BBC documentary called &quot;Hildegard of Bingen&quot; (1994), by Ángela Molina in &quot;Barbarossa&quot; (2009) and by Barbara Sukowa in the film &quot;Vision&quot;, directed by Margarethe von Trotta.

A feature documentary film, &quot;The Unruly Mystic: Saint Hildegard&quot;, was released by American director Michael M. Conti in 2014.

Hildegard makes an appearance in &quot;The Baby-Sitters Club #101: Claudia Kishi, Middle School Drop-Out&quot; by Ann M. Martin, when Anna Stevenson dresses as Hildegard for Halloween.

Kristin Hayter, known professionally as Lingua Ignota, was inspired by Hildegard of Bingen.

<text>Hilversum () is a city and municipality in the province of North Holland, Netherlands. Located in the heart of the Gooi, it is the largest urban centre in that area. It is surrounded by heathland, woods, meadows, lakes and smaller towns. Hilversum is part of the Randstad, one of the largest conurbations in Europe, and the Amsterdam metropolitan area; it is about 22km southeast of Amsterdam&#x27;s city centre and about 15km north of Utrecht.

The city is home to several major radio, television, and newspaper companies such as &quot;Nederlandse Omroep Stichting&quot;. Hilversum is thus known for being the &quot;mediastad&quot; (media city) of the Netherlands.

== Town ==
Hilversum lies south-east of Amsterdam and north of Utrecht. The town is known for its architecturally important Town Hall (Raadhuis Hilversum), designed by Willem Marinus Dudok and built in 1931.

Hilversum has one public library, two swimming pools (Van Hellemond Sport and De Lieberg), several sports halls, and several shopping centers (such as Hilvertshof, Winkelcentrum Kerkelanden, De Riebeeckgalerij, and Winkelcentrum Seinhorst). Locally, the town center is known as .

== Geography ==
Hilversum is located on the sandy, hilly parts of the Gooi region and has four hills: the Boomberg (closest to the town center); the Trompenberg (now a luxury residential area), the Hoorneboeg (farther to the south), and two kilometers east of there, the Zwaluwenberg (25m), home to the headquarters of the inspector-general of the armies since 1950. These hills date from the period of the Ice-age, when Hilversum was the southern-most point covered by glaciers.

The surrounding towns of Hilversum are Nieuw-Loosdrecht, Bussum, Kortenhoef, Blaricum, Hollandsche Rading, Lage Vuursche, Maartensdijk, &#x27;s-Graveland, Laren, Nederhorst den Berg, and Ankeveen.

Hilversum consists of the following districts and neighborhoods: Center (Langgewenstbuurt, Sint Vitusbuurt, Havenstraatbuurt, and Centrum), Northwest (Nimrodpark, Trompenberg North, Trompenberg South, Media Park, Raadhuiskwartier, and Boomberg), Northeast (North, Johannes Geradtswegbuurt, Erfgooiersbuurt, and AZC Crailo), East (Geuzenbuurt, Electrobuurt, Astronomiebuurt, Science neighborhood, Kamrad, Kleine Driftbuurt and Liebergen), Southeast (Bloemkwartier Noord, Bloemenkwartier Zuid, Schilderskwartier, &#x27;t Hoogt van&#x27; t Kruis, Arenaparkkwartier and West Indiëkwartier), Zuid (Schrijverskwartier, Staatsliedenkwartier and Zeeheldenkwartier), Southwest (Kerkelanden, Havenkwartier, Zeverijn and Het Rode Dorp) and Hilversumse Meent. In 1767, Hilversum was still divided into 4 districts (quarters): the Neuquartier, Groestquartier, Kerkquartier, and the Sandtbergerquartier.

The Oude Haven in the southwest is at the end of the Gooische Vaart. The construction of the canal between &#x27;s-Graveland and Hilversum was done in stages over 240 years. The canal was completed in 1876. Later, a modern harbor was dug, surrounded by an industrial estate. There is also a leisure harbor.

== International ==
Hilversum has a variety of international schools, such as the &quot;Violenschool&quot; and &quot;International School Hilversum &quot;Alberdingk Thijm&quot;&quot;. Also, Nike&#x27;s, Hunkemöller&#x27;s and Converse&#x27;s European headquarters are located in Hilversum.

== History ==
Earthenware found in Hilversum gives its name to the Hilversum culture, which is an early- to mid-Bronze Age, or 1800–1200 BC material culture. Artifacts from this prehistoric civilization bear similarities to the Wessex Culture of southern Britain and may indicate that the first Hilversum residents emigrated from that area.

The first brick settlements formed around 900, but it was not until 1305 that the first official mention of Hilversum (&quot;Hilfersheem&quot; from &quot;Hilvertshem&quot; meaning &quot;houses between the hills&quot;) was found. At that time it was a part of Naarden, the oldest town in the Gooi area.
Farming, raising sheep, and wool manufacturing were the main sources of income for inhabitants of the Gooi region in the Middle Ages. In 1424, Hilversum received its first official independent status. This made further growth possible because permission was no longer needed from neighboring Naarden for new industrial development.

The town grew further in the 17th century when the Dutch economy was strong, and several canals were built connecting it indirectly to Amsterdam.

In 1725 and 1766 large fires destroyed most of the town, leveling parts of the old townhouse and the church next to it. The town overcame these setbacks and the textile industry continued to develop, among other ways by devising a way to weave cows&#x27; hair.

In the 19th century a substantial textile and tapestry industry emerged, aided by a railway link to Amsterdam in 1874. From that time onward the town grew quickly with wealthy commuters from Amsterdam moving in, building themselves large villas in the wooded surroundings, and gradually starting to live in Hilversum permanently. Despite this growth, Hilversum was never granted city rights so it is still referred to by many locals as &quot;het dorp&quot;, or &quot;the village.&quot;

For the 1928 Summer Olympics in neighboring Amsterdam, it hosted all of the non-jumping equestrian and the running part of the modern pentathlon event.

The &quot;Nederlandse Seintoestellen Fabriek&quot; (NSF) company established a professional transmitter and radio factory in Hilversum in the early 1920s, growing into the largest of its kind in the Netherlands.

Following the defeat of Allied forces in the Netherlands in 1940, and its occupation by Nazi Germany, Hilversum became the headquarters of the German Army (&quot;Heer&quot;) in the Netherlands. On February 25 and 26, 1941, most of Hilversum&#x27;s factories went on strike against the start of the Holocaust in the so-called February strike (Amsterdam Docker&#x27;s Strike). Some 10,000 people took part. The Holocaust took the lives of 2,000 Hilversum Jews and the community never fully recovered. Since 2015 there has been an annual remembrance service. Some 50 Hilversummers were awarded the title of Righteous among the nations from Yad Vashem, including Victor Kugler, one of Anne Frank&#x27;s helpers.

In 1948, NSF was taken over by Philips. However, Dutch radio broadcasting organizations (followed by television broadcasters during the 1950s) centralised their operations in Hilversum, providing a source of continuing economic growth. The concentration of broadcasters in Hilversum has given it its enduring status as the media city for the Netherlands.

In 1964, the population reached a record high of over 103,000. However, the textile industry had started its decline; only one factory, Veneta, managed to continue into the 1960s, when it also had to close. Another major industry, the chemical factory IFF, also closed by the end of the 1960s.

After the 1960s, the population gradually declined, until stabilising at around 86,000 in 2006 and rising to 90,000 in 2018. Several factors other than the slump in manufacturing contributed to this decline: one is the reduction in average family size, with fewer people living in each house; second, the town is virtually unable to expand because much surrounding land was sold by city architect W.M. Dudok to the Goois Natuurreservaat (&quot;nl&quot;); third, the rapid increase in property values forced many people to move to less expensive areas in the Netherlands.

Hilversum was one of the first towns to have a local party of the populist movement called &quot;Leefbaar&quot; (&quot;liveable&quot;). Founded by former social-democrat Jan Nagel, it was initially held at bay for alderman positions. In 2001, Nagel from Leefbaar Hilversum teamed up with Leefbaar Utrecht leaders to found a national Leefbaar Nederland party.

The town has undertaken many improvements, including renovating its central train station, renovation of the main shopping centre (Hilvertshof), and development of new dining and retail districts downtown including the &quot;vintage&quot; district in the Leeuwenstraat. Several notable architectural accomplishments include the Institute for Sound and Vision, and Zanderij Crailoo (&quot;nl&quot;), the largest man-made wildlife crossing in the world.

The nearby Media Park was the scene of the 2002 assassination of politician Pim Fortuyn; in 2015, a gunman carrying a false pistol stormed into Nederlandse Omroep Stichting&#x27;s headquarters, demanding airtime on the evening news.

==Culture==

There is the large Catholic neo-gothic St. Vitus church (P.J.H. Cuypers, 1892, bell tower 96 metres; 315&#x27;). The city played host to many landscape artists during the 19th century, including Barend Cornelis Koekkoek.

In the 1950s and 1960s the city played host to a major European Tennis tournament.

The 1958 Eurovision Song Contest took place in Hilversum. In 2020 the international television event &quot;&quot; was broadcast from Studio 21 in Hilversum&#x27;s Media Park. This event was held in place of the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Broadcasting ===

Hilversum is often called &quot;media city&quot;, since it is the principal centre for radio and television broadcasting in the Netherlands, and is home to an extensive complex of radio and television studios and to the administrative headquarters of the multiple broadcasting organizations which make up the Netherlands Public Broadcasting system. Hilversum is also home to many newer commercial TV production companies. Radio Netherlands, which had been broadcasting worldwide via shortwave radio since the 1920s, was also based in Hilversum until it was dissolved in 2013.

The following is a list of organizations that have, or are continuing to, broadcast from studios in Hilversum:
One result of the town&#x27;s history as an important radio transmission centre is that many older radio sets throughout Europe featured &quot;Hilversum&quot; as a pre-marked dial position on their tuning scales.

Dutch national voting in the Eurovision Song Contest is normally co-ordinated from Hilversum.

== Transport ==
===Airport===

Hilversum Airport is located in the southwest of the municipality. Next to it is the former Marine Training Camp (MOK), now Corporal Van Oudheusden Barracks for the medical troops. In wartime the airfield was expanded significantly by the German military. They also set up an assembly line for training aircraft, produced by Fokker in Weesp.

=== Railway ===
Hilversum is well connected to the Dutch railway network, and has three stations.
=== Public buses ===
Most local and regional buses are operated by Connexxion, but two of the bus routes are operated by Syntus Utrecht and two others by U-OV and Pouw Vervoer. Regional bus route 320 is operated by both Connexxion and Pouw Vervoer. In 2018, major road works started to make room for a new BRT bus lane from Hilversum to Huizen, set to open in early 2021.

After the 2022 elections, the municipal government was made up of aldermen from the political parties Hart voor Hilversum, VVD, GroenLinks and CDA. The mayor is Gerhard van den Top.

Hart voor Hilversum, a local party, is the largest group on the council. Originally a part of Leefbaar Hilversum, it separated to form a party called DLPH, which won 1 seat in the 2006 elections. In 2006 leadership was taken over by Léonie Sazias, a TV celebrity. She later changed the party name to Hart voor Hilversum. They won 3 seats in the 2010 elections, 6 in 2014 and 8 in both 2018 and 2022.

<text>&quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot; is a 182-line poem written by English poet Francis Thompson (1859–1907). The poem became famous and was the source of much of Thompson&#x27;s posthumous reputation. It was first printed in 1890 in the periodical &quot;Merry England&quot;, later to appear in Thompson&#x27;s first volume of poems in 1893. It was included in the &quot;Oxford Book of English Mystical Verse&quot; (1917).

==Form and theme==
The poem is an ode, and its subject is the pursuit of the human soul by God&#x27;s love - a theme also found in the devotional poetry of George Herbert and Henry Vaughan. Moody and Lovett point out that Thompson&#x27;s use of free and varied line lengths and irregular rhythms reflect the panicked retreat of the soul, while the structured, often recurring refrain suggests the inexorable pursuit as it comes ever closer.

The Jesuit J.F.X. O&#x27;Conor remarks of the Christian themes of the poem that,
&quot;The name is strange. It startles one at first. It is so bold, so new, so fearless. It does not attract, rather the reverse. But when one reads the poem this strangeness disappears. The meaning is understood. As the hound follows the hare, never ceasing in its running, ever drawing nearer in the chase, with unhurrying and unperturbed pace, so does God follow the fleeing soul by His Divine grace. And though in sin or in human love, away from God it seeks to hide itself, Divine grace follows after, unwearyingly follows ever after, till the soul feels its pressure forcing it to turn to Him alone in that never ending pursuit.&quot;

==Musical settings==
* William Henry Harris &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot; (1919)
* Humphrey John Stewart The Hound of Heaven (1924)
* Miriam Gideon &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot; (1945)
* Maurice Jacobson &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot; (1953)
* Howard Blake &quot;Benedictus&quot; (1980)
* Ronald Corp &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot; (2009)

==Influence==
* Actor Dean Jones used the line &quot;Under Running Laughter&quot; from the first stanza as the title of his memoir.
* Thompson&#x27;s work was praised by G. K. Chesterton, and it was also an influence on J. R. R. Tolkien, who presented a paper on Thompson in 1914.
* In 1933, Halliday Sutherland used a phrase from the second line of the poem as the title of his best-selling autobiography, &quot;The Arches of the Years&quot;.
* In 1935, Paramahansa Yogananda, an Indian spiritual master, included &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot; in one of his phonographic albums, &quot;Songs of My Heart&quot;. Today, his organization, Self-Realization Fellowship, offers this album in the form of a CD. Kamala Silva, a purported direct disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda, received the gift of a printing of the &quot;Hound of Heaven&quot; from Yogananda and he also recited it for her.
* A short passage from the poem appears in chapter four of Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1938).
* &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot; inspired Norwegian composer Fartein Valen (1887–1952) to compose his &quot;Piano Sonata No. 2&quot;, Op. 38 (1941). The sonata&#x27;s three movements reflect different parts of Thompson&#x27;s poem. The piece has been recorded by Glenn Gould.
* Thompson&#x27;s poem is mentioned and quoted in Robert Frost&#x27;s 1947 play &quot;A Masque of Mercy&quot;.
* &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot; was used as an example of the hero&#x27;s &quot;refusal of the call&quot; to adventure in Joseph Campbell&#x27;s book, &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; (1949)
* In 1955, a love letter from Suzanne Kempe to her philosophy lecturer, Sydney Sparkes Orr, quotes excerpts from the poem. Their affair was later brought to trial in Tasmania.
* Thompson&#x27;s poem is the source of the phrase, &quot;with all deliberate speed,&quot; used by the Supreme Court in &quot;Brown II&quot; (1955), the remedy phase of the famous decision on school desegregation.
* Thompson&#x27;s poem was the inspiration for a series of 23 paintings by the American painter R. H. Ives Gammell (1893–1981), &quot;A Pictorial Sequence Painted by R. H. Ives Gammell Based on The Hound of Heaven&quot;, which was in planning by 1941 and completed in 1956. A reading of &quot;The Psychology of the Unconscious&quot; by C. G. Jung showed Gammell a way in which he might give visual form to Thompson&#x27;s poem.
* &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot; is the fifth chapter in Robert L. Short&#x27;s 1965 book &quot;The Gospel According to Peanuts&quot; where he describes Snoopy as a &quot;little Christ&quot; carrying out &quot;Christ&#x27;s ambivalent work of humbling the exalted and exalting the humble.&quot;
* In A. J. Cronin&#x27;s novel, &quot;A Pocketful of Rye&quot; (1969), the protagonist Carroll reads the poem as a young man, forgets it, and suffers from a recurring nightmare that finally leads to his conversion.
* In 1970, Canadian artist William Kurelek used lines from &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot; as titles for his &quot;Nature, Poor Stepdame, A Series of Sixteen Farm Paintings&quot;
* In 1975 &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot; was mentioned in the suicide note of George R. Price, a geneticist who pioneered the evolutionary theory of altruism and suicide (among other things), before becoming a committed Christian and giving away all his possessions to the poor.
* The Christian alternative rock band Daniel Amos wrote a song titled &quot;Hound of Heaven&quot; on their 1978 album &quot;Horrendous Disc&quot; that is based on the Thompson poem.
* Contemporary Christian music artist Michael Card also wrote and recorded a song called &quot;Hound of Heaven&quot; based on Thompson&#x27;s poem for his 1981 debut album &quot;First Light&quot;.
* Lines from the poem are recited between the discussion during the last scene in &quot;The last enemy&quot;, which is the 2nd episode, 3rd season of &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; (1989).
* In 2001 Ken Bruen cites the poem admiringly in his novel &quot;The Guards&quot;.
* In 2002, Katherine A. Powers, literary columnist for the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, called &quot;Hound of Heaven&quot; &quot;perhaps the most beloved and ubiquitously taught poem among American Catholics for over half a century&quot;. 
* &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot; is the first chapter in John Stott&#x27;s book &quot;Why I am a Christian&quot; (2003) in which he confesses that he is a Christian not because of the influence of his parents and teachers, nor to his own personal decision, but to being relentlessly pursued by &#x27;the Hound of Heaven&#x27;, that is, Jesus Christ himself.
* The poem is mentioned and lines quoted in the novel &quot;Escape from Hell&quot; (2009) by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle
* The main character is reading a book by this name in the first episode of the Irish TV series &quot;Jack Taylor&quot;.
* In describing her journey from atheism and agnosticism to devout Christianity, Fox News commentator Kirsten Powers said, &quot;The Hound of Heaven had pursued me and caught me...&quot;
* In 2014, N. D. Wilson wrote and directed a short film based upon the poem, titled &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot;.
* In April 2020, in an interview with Phoebe Waller-Bridge on his show &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, Stephen Colbert told her that he thought the fox that appeared in her series &quot;Fleabag&quot; was the Hound of Heaven, which appeared to astound and delight Waller-Bridge.

* Five lines from the poem were used in a 1989 episode of &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, &quot;The Last Enemy&quot;. 
** &quot;...My mangled youth lies dead beneath the heap. / My days have crackled and gone up in smoke, / Have puffed and burst as sun-starts on a stream. / Yea, faileth now even dream / The dreamer, and the lute the lutanist...&quot;
