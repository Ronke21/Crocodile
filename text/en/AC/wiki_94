<text>Mustafa İsmet İnönü (; 24 September 1884 – 25 December 1973) was a Turkish army officer and statesman who served as the second president of Turkey from 11 November 1938, to 22 May 1950, and as its prime minister three times: from 1923 to 1924, 1925 to 1937, and 1961 to 1965.

İnönü is acknowledged by many as Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s right-hand man, with their friendship going back to the Caucasus campaign. In the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, he served as the first chief of the General Staff from 1922 to 1924 for the regular Turkish army, during which he commanded forces during the First and Second Battles of İnönü. Atatürk bestowed İsmet with the surname İnönü, the site of the battles, when the 1934 Surname Law was adopted. He was also chief negotiator in the Mudanya and Lausanne conferences for the Ankara government, successfully negotiating away the Treaty of Sèvres for the Treaty of Lausanne. As his prime minister for most of his presidency, İnönü executed many of Atatürk&#x27;s modernizing and nationalist reforms. İnönü gave the orders to carry out the Zilan Massacre.

İnönü succeeded Atatürk as president of Turkey after his death in 1938 and was granted the official title of (&quot;National Chief&quot;) by the parliament. As president and chairman of the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP), İnönü initially continued Turkey&#x27;s one party state. Kemalist style programs continued to make great strides in education by supporting projects such as Village Institutes. His governments implemented notably heavy statist economic policies. The Hatay State was annexed in 1939, and Turkey was able to maintain an armed neutrality during World War II, joining the Allied powers only three months before the end of the European Theater. The Turkish Straits crisis prompted İnönü to build closer ties with the Western powers, with the country eventually joining NATO in 1952, though by then he was no longer president.

Factionalism between statists and liberals in the CHP led to the creation of the Democrat Party in 1946. İnönü held the first multiparty elections in the Republic&#x27;s history that year, beginning Turkey&#x27;s multiparty period. 1950 saw a peaceful transfer of power to the Democrats when the CHP suffered defeat in the elections. For ten years, İnönü served as the leader of the opposition before returning to power as prime minister following the 1961 election, held after the 1960 coup-d&#x27;état. The 1960s saw İnönü reinvent the CHP as a political party, which was &quot;Left of Center&quot; as a new party cadre led by Bülent Ecevit became more influential. İnönü remained leader of the CHP until 1972, when he was defeated by Ecevit in a leadership contest. He died on December 25, 1973, of a heart attack, at the age of 89. He is interred opposite to Atatürk&#x27;s mausoleum at Anıtkabir in Ankara.

== Early life ==
İsmet İnönü (born Mustafa İsmet) was born in 1884 in Smyrna (İzmir) in the Aidin Vilayet to Hacı Reşit and Cevriye (later Cevriye Temelli). Hacı Reşit was retired after serving as director of the First Examinant Department of the Legal Affairs Bureau of the War Ministry (&quot;Harbiye Nezareti Muhakemat Dairesi Birinci Mümeyyizliği&quot;). A member of the Kürümoğlu family of Bitlis, İnönü&#x27;s father was born in Malatya. According to its members studying the ancestral background of the family, Kürümoğlus were of Turkish origin, while secondary sources refer to the family as of Kurdish descent. His mother was the daughter of Müderris Hasan Efendi, who belonged to the ulema and was a member of the Turkish family of Razgrad (present-day Bulgaria). In 1933 he visited Razgrad since the city&#x27;s Turkish cemetery was attacked. İsmet was the family&#x27;s second child; he had three brothers, including the family&#x27;s first child, Ahmet Midhat, two younger brothers, Hasan Rıza and Hayri (Temelli), as well as a sister Seniha (Otakan). Due to his father&#x27;s assignments, the family moved from one city to another.

== Military career ==
=== In the Ottoman Empire ===
İnönü completed his primary education in Sivas and graduated from Sivas Military Junior High School (&quot;Sivas Askerî Rüştiyesi&quot;) in 1894. He then studied at the Sivas School for Civil Servants (&quot;Sivas Mülkiye İdadisi&quot;) for a year. He graduated from the Imperial School of Military Engineering in 1904 as a lieutenant gunnery officer and entered the Military Academy to graduate as a first-rank staff captain on 26 September 1906. İnönü started his duty in the Second Army based in Adrianople (Edirne) on 2 October 1906, in the 3rd Battery Command of the 8th Field Artillery Regiment. As part of his platoon officer staff internship, he gave lessons in military strategy and artillery. Captain İsmet was also part of the Ottoman–Bulgarian commissions.

Through Ali Fethi (Okyar), he briefly joined the Committee of Union and Progress in 1907, which wished to overthrow Sultan Abdul Hamid II. During the 31 March Incident, he was on the staff of the Second Cavalry Division, which was mobilized to join the Action Army and marched on Constantinople (İstanbul) to depose Abdul Hamid II. Returning to Adrianople following the suppression of the mutiny, İnönü left the committee in the summer of 1909.

He won his first military victory by suppressing Imam Yahya Muhammad Hamiddin&#x27;s revolt in Yemen. İsmet eventually became chief of staff of the force sent to suppress the rebellion and personally negotiated with Imam Yahya in Kaffet-ül-Uzer to bring Yemen back into the empire. For this, he was promoted to the rank of major. He returned to Constantinople in March 1913 to defend the capital from Bulgarian attack during the First Balkan War. İnönü was part of the Turkish delegation that negotiated the Treaty of Constantinople with the Bulgarians as a military adviser. He held a close relationship with Enver Pasha and played an active role in the reformation of the army.

=== World War I ===

İnönü began climbing the ranks during World War I, becoming lieutenant colonel on 29 November 1914, and then being appointed as the First Branch Manager of the General Headquarters on 2 December. He was appointed chief of staff of the Second Army on 9 October 1915, and was promoted to the rank of colonel on 14 December 1915.

He married Emine Mevhibe Hanim on 13 April 1917, three weeks before he left for the front to return home only after the conclusion of the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918. Of which she later bore his three sons and one daughter. He began working with Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk) Pasha as a corps commander on the Caucasian Front. İnönü was appointed to the IV Corps Command on 12 January 1917, upon the recommendation of Atatürk. He was recalled to Constantinople after a while and returned to take part as a corps commander of the Seventh Army. On 1 May, he was appointed to command XX Corps on the Palestine Front, and then III Corps on 20 June. He once again came into contact with Atatürk when he assumed command of the Seventh Army. İnönü&#x27;s forces received the brunt of Edmond Allenby&#x27;s attack on Beersheba that ended the stalemate on the Sinai front. He was wounded in the Battle of Megiddo and was sent back to Constantinople, where he held various administrative positions in the War Ministry during the armistice period.

=== Turkish War of Independence ===
After the military occupation of Constantinople on 16 March 1920, İnönü decided to escape to Anatolia to join the Ankara government. He and his chief of staff, Major Saffet (Arıkan) escaped Maltepe in the evening of 19 March and arrived in Ankara on 9 April. He joined the Grand National Assembly (GNA), which was opened on 23 April 1920, as a deputy of Edirne. Like many others in the Turkish National Movement, he was sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; by the Ottoman government on 6 June 1920.

In May 1920, he was appointed chief of the general staff. The next year, he was appointed commander of the Western Front of the Army of the GNA, a position in which he remained during the Turkish War of Independence. He was promoted to the rank of Mirliva (to that extent, Pasha) after winning the First and Second Battle of İnönü. When the 1934 Surname Law was adopted Atatürk bestowed İsmet Pasha with the surname İnönü, where the battles took place.

İnönü was replaced by Mustafa Fevzi Pasha (Çakmak), who was also the prime minister and minister of defense at the time, as the chief of staff after the Turkish forces lost major battles against the advancing Greek Army in July 1921, as a result of which the cities of Afyonkarahisar, Kütahya and Eskişehir were temporarily lost. During the war, İnönü&#x27;s infant son İzzet died before his victory in Sakarya and this news was only delivered to him in the spring of 1922. His wife, Emine Mevhibe hid the news and the severity of his son&#x27;s sickness due to the intensity of the war. He participated as a staff officer (with the rank Brigadier General) in the later battles, including Dumlupınar.

=== Chief negotiator in Mudanya and Lausanne ===
After the War of Independence was won, İnönü was appointed as the chief negotiator of the Turkish delegation, both for the Armistice of Mudanya and for the Treaty of Lausanne.

The Lausanne conference convened in late 1922 to settle the terms of a new treaty that would take the place of the Treaty of Sèvres. İnönü became famous for his stubborn resolve in determining the position of Ankara as the legitimate, sovereign government of Turkey. After delivering his position, İsmet turned off his hearing aid during the speeches of British foreign secretary Lord Curzon. When Curzon had finished, İnönü reiterated his position as if Curzon had never said a word.

== Prime ministership ==

İsmet İnönü served as the prime minister of Turkey throughout Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s presidency, stepping down as prime minister for three months during Fethi Okyar&#x27;s premiership and in the last year of Atatürk&#x27;s presidency when he was replaced by Celâl Bayar. He therefore helped to execute most of Atatürk&#x27;s reformist programs. It was his suggestion to make Ankara the capital of Turkey, which was approved by the parliament. İnönü was also an important factor in the proclamation of the Republic and the abolition of the Caliphate and Evkaf Ministry. He resigned from the premiership for health reasons on 22 November 1924 for Fethi Okyar, but since Okyar lost a vote of confidence from parliament due to the Sheikh Said rebellion, İnönü returned to the position of prime minister.

İnönü immediately banned all opposition parties (including the Progressive Republican Party) and the press. Independence Tribunals were reestablished to prosecute the Kurdish rebels. In 1926, it allegedly came out that former members of the CUP attempted to assassinate Atatürk in the İzmir plot, which resulted in the remaining CUP leaders being executed. İnönü retired his military command in 1927.

=== Nationalist policy ===
While dealing with the Sheikh Said revolt, İnönü proclaimed a Turkish nationalist policy and encouraged the Turkification of the non-Turkish population. Following the suppression of the Sheikh Said rebellion, he presided over the Reform Council for the East, which prepared the Report for Reform in the East, which recommended impede the establishment of a Kurdish elite, forbid non-Turkish languages, and create regional administrative units called Inspectorates-General, which were to be governed by martial law. He stated the following in regards to the Kurds; &quot;We&#x27;re frankly nationalists, and nationalism is our only factor of cohesion. Before the Turkish majority, other elements had no kind of influence. At any price, we must Turkify the inhabitants of our land, and we will annihilate those who oppose.&quot; Following this report, three Inspectorate-Generals were established in the Kurdish areas, which comprise several provinces. Under İnönü&#x27;s regime, the Zilan massacre of thousands of Kurdish civilians was perpetrated by the Turkish Land Forces in the Zilan Valley of Van Province on 12 and 13 July 1930, during the Ararat rebellion. Nation building was codified into law when a new settlement regime was enacted in 1934, resettling Albanians, Abkhazians, Circassians, and Kurds in new areas in order to create a homogeneous Turkish state.

=== Social policy ===

İnönü was responsible for most of the reformist legislation promulgated during Turkey&#x27;s one party period. The Hat Law and the closure of Dervish lodges were enacted in 1925; in 1928, the Turkish alphabet switched to being written with Latin characters, and in 1934, titles such as Efendi, Bey, and Pasha were abolished; and certain articles of religious clothing were banned, though İnönü was and still is popularly known as İsmet Pasha. 1934 was also the year that the Surname Law was adopted, with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk bestowing İsmet with the surname İnönü, the location where İsmet won the battles against the Greek army in 1921. He was also a proponent of replacing foreign loan words with &quot;Pure Turkish&quot; words.

=== Economic policy ===
İnönü managed the economy with heavy-handed government intervention, especially during the Great Depression, by implementing an economic plan inspired by the &quot;Five Year Plan&quot; of the Soviet Union. In doing so, he took much private property under government control. Due to his efforts, to this day, more than 70% of land in Turkey is still owned by the state.

Desiring a more liberal economic system, Atatürk dissolved the government of İnönü in 1937 and appointed Celâl Bayar, the founder of the first Turkish commercial bank, Türkiye İş Bankası, as prime minister, thus beginning a decades long rivalry between Bayar and İnönü.

== Presidency (1938–1950) ==

=== Prewar ===
After the death of Atatürk on 10 November 1938, İnönü was viewed as the most appropriate candidate to succeed him and was unanimously elected the second president of the Republic of Turkey and leader of the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP). He attempted to build himself a cult of personality by receiving the official title of &quot;Millî Şef&quot;, i.e., &quot;National Chief&quot;.

One of his first actions was to annex in 1939 the Hatay State, which declared independence from French Syria. İnönü also wished to move on from one-party rule by taking incremental steps to multiparty politics. He hoped to accomplish this by establishing the Independent Group as a force of opposition in the parliament, but they fell short of expectations under wartime conditions. İnönü dismissed Bayar&#x27;s government because of differences between the two on economic policy in 1939. İnönü was an avowed statist, while Bayar wished for a more liberal economy. Turkey&#x27;s early industrialization accelerated under İnönü but the onset of World War II disrupted economic growth.

Much reform in education was accomplished during İnönü&#x27;s presidency through the efforts of Hasan Âli Yücel, who was minister of education throughout İnönü&#x27;s governments. 1940 saw the establishment of the Village Institutes, in which well-performing students from the country were selected to train as teachers and return to their hometown to run community development programs.

=== World War II ===

==== Foreign policy ====
World War II broke out in the first year of his presidency, and both the Allies and the Axis pressured İnönü to bring Turkey into the war on their side. The Germans sent Franz von Papen to Ankara in April 1939, while the British sent Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen and the French René Massigli. On 23 April 1939, Turkish Foreign Minister Şükrü Saracoğlu told Knatchbull-Hugessen of his nation&#x27;s fears of Italian claims to the Mediterranean as &quot;Mare Nostrum&quot; and German control of the Balkans and suggested an Anglo-Soviet-Turkish alliance as the best way of countering the Axis. In May 1939, during the visit of Maxime Weygand to Turkey, İnönü told the French Ambassador René Massigli that he believed that the best way of stopping Germany was an alliance of Turkey, the Soviet Union, France and Britain; that if such an alliance came into being, the Turks would allow Soviet ground and air forces onto their soil; and that he wanted a major programme of French military aid to modernize the Turkish armed forces.

The signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939, drew Turkey away from the Allies; the Turks always believed that it was essential to have the Soviet Union as an ally to counter Germany, and thus the signing of the German–Soviet pact undercut completely the assumptions behind Turkish security policy. With the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact, İnönü chose to be neutral in World War II as taking on Germany and the Soviet Union at the same time would be too much for Turkey, though he signed a tripartite treaty of alliance with Britain and France on 19 October 1939, obligating Turkey&#x27;s entry into the war if fighting spread to the Mediterranean. However, with France&#x27;s defeat in June 1940 İnönü abandoned the pro-Allied neutrality that he had followed since the beginning of the war. A major embarrassment for the Turks occurred in July 1940 when the Germans captured and published documents from the Quai d&#x27;Orsay in Paris showing the Turks were aware of Operation Pike—as the Anglo–French plan in the winter of 1939–40 to bomb the oil fields in the Soviet Union from Turkey was codenamed—which was intended by Berlin to worsen relations between Ankara and Moscow. In turn, worsening relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey were intended to drive Turkey into the arms of the &quot;Reich&quot;. After the publication of the French documents relating to Operation Pike, İnönü pulled out of the tripartite pact signed with Britain and France and signed the German–Turkish Treaty of Friendship and the Clodius Agreement, which placed Turkey within the German economic sphere of influence, but İnönü went no further towards the Axis.

In the first half of 1941, Germany, which was intent on invading the Soviet Union, went out of its way to improve relations with Turkey as the &quot;Reich&quot; hoped for benevolent Turkish neutrality when the German-Soviet war began. At the same time, the British had great hopes in the spring of 1941 when they dispatched an expeditionary force to Greece that İnönü could be persuaded to enter the war on the Allied side as the British leadership had high hopes of creating a Balkan front that would tie down German forces, which thus led to a major British diplomatic offensive with Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden visiting Ankara several times to meet with İnönü. İnönü always told Eden that the Turks would not join the British forces in Greece, and the Turks would only enter the war if Germany attacked Turkey. For his part, Papen offered İnönü parts of Greece if Turkey were to enter the war on the Axis side, an offer İnönü declined. In May 1941 when the Germans dispatched an expeditionary force to Iraq to fight against the British, İnönü refused Papen&#x27;s request that the German forces be allowed transit rights to Iraq. Another attempt by Hitler to woo Turkey came in February 1943, when Talaat Pasha&#x27;s remains were returned to Turkey for a state burial.

Internal opposition to Turkish neutrality came from ultra-nationalist circles and factions of the military that wished to incorporate the Turkic-populated areas of the Soviet Union by allying with Germany. This almost erupted into a coup d&#x27;état against the government. Leading pan-Turkists including Alparslan Türkeş, Nihal Atsız, and Şaik Gökyay were arrested and sentenced to time in prison in the Racism-Turanism trials.British Prime Minister Winston Churchill traveled to Ankara in January 1943 for a conference with President İnönu to urge Turkey&#x27;s entry into the war on the allied side. Churchill met secretly with İnönü inside a railroad car at the Yenice Station near Adana. By 4–6 December 1943, İnönü felt confident enough about the outcome of the war that he met openly with Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill at the Second Cairo Conference. Until 1941, both Roosevelt and Churchill thought that Turkey&#x27;s continued neutrality would serve the interests of the Allies by blocking the Axis from reaching the strategic oil reserves of the Middle East. But the early victories of the Axis up to the end of 1942 caused Roosevelt and Churchill to re-evaluate possible Turkish participation in the war on the side of the Allies. Turkey had maintained a decently-sized army and air force throughout the war, and Churchill wanted the Turks to open a new front in the Balkans. Roosevelt, on the other hand, still believed that a Turkish attack would be too risky and an eventual Turkish failure would have disastrous effects for the Allies. İnönü knew very well the hardships that his country had suffered during decades of incessant war between 1908 and 1922 and was determined to keep Turkey out of another war as long as he could. The young Turkish Republic was still re-building, recovering from the losses due to earlier wars, and lacked any modern weapons and the infrastructure to enter a war to be fought along and possibly within its borders. İnönü based his neutrality policy during the Second World War on the premise that Western Allies and the Soviet Union would sooner or later have a falling out after the war. Thus, İnönu wanted assurances on financial and military aid for Turkey, as well as a guarantee that the United States and the United Kingdom would stand beside Turkey in the event of a Soviet invasion of the Turkish Straits after the war. In August 1944, İnönü broke off diplomatic relations with Germany, and on 5 January 1945, İnönü severed diplomatic relations with Japan. Shortly afterwards, İnönü allowed Allied shipping to use the Turkish Straits to send supplies to the Soviet Union, and on 25 February 1945, he declared war on Germany and Japan. For this Turkey became a founding member of the United Nations.

The post-war tensions and arguments surrounding the Turkish Straits would come to be known as the Turkish Straits crisis. The fear of Soviet invasion and Joseph Stalin&#x27;s unconcealed desire for Soviet military bases in the Turkish Straits eventually caused Turkey to give up its principle of neutrality in foreign relations and join NATO in February 1952.

==== Domestic policy ====
Maintaining an armed neutrality proved to be disruptive for the young republic. The country existed in a practical state of war throughout the Second World War: military production was prioritized at the expense of peacetime goods, rationing and curfews were implemented, and high taxes were put in place, causing severe economic hardship for many. One such tax was the Wealth Tax (Varlık Vergisi), a discriminatory tax that demanded very high one-time payments from Turkey&#x27;s non-Muslim minorities. This tax is seen by many to be a continuation of the Jizya tax paid by dhimmis during Ottoman times, or &quot;Millî İktisat&quot; (National Economy) economic policy implemented by the Committee of Union and Progress regime three decades ago. It was only repealed in 1944 under American and British pressure.

A famous story of İnönü happened in a meeting in Bursa for the 1969 general elections. A young man yelled at him, &quot;You let us go without food!&quot; İnönü replied to him by saying, &quot;Yes, I let you go without food, but I did not let you become fatherless,&quot; implying the death of millions of people from both sides of World War II.

=== Post-War democratization ===

For the Kemalists there was always a desire for Turkey to develop into a democracy. Before the Independent Group, Atatürk experimented with opposition through the Liberal Republican Party, which lasted three months before it had to be shut down when reactionaries threatened to hijack the party. In an opening speech to the Grand National Assembly on 1 November 1945, İnönü openly expressed the country&#x27;s need for an opposition party. He welcomed Celâl Bayar establishing the Democrat Party (DP), which separated from the CHP. However, due to the anti-Communist hysteria brought on by the new Soviet threat, new leftist parties were swiftly banned, and rural development initiatives such as the Village Institutes and People&#x27;s Rooms were closed. Even with such pressure on the left, İnönü established the Ministry of Labour in 1945 and signed into law important protections for workers. Universities were given autonomy, and İnönü&#x27;s title of &quot;unchangeable chairman&quot; of CHP was abolished.

İnönü allowed for Turkey&#x27;s first multiparty elections to be held in 1946; however, the elections were infamously not free and fair; voting was carried out under the gaze of onlookers who could determine which voters had voted for which parties, and secrecy prevailed as to the subsequent counting of votes. Instead of inviting Şükrü Saraçoğlu to form another government, he assigned CHP hardliner Recep Peker to the task, who contributed to a polarizing atmosphere in the parliament. İnönü had to act as a mediator several times between Peker and Bayar, who threatened to have the DP walk from parliament if they didn&#x27;t have some of their demands met, such as ensuring judicial review, secret ballots, and public counting for elections. On 12 July 1947 İsmet İnönü gave a speech broadcast on radio and in newspapers that he would stand equal distance from the government and opposition, prompting Peker&#x27;s resignation.

Free and fair national elections had to wait until 1950, and on that occasion, İnönü&#x27;s government was defeated. In the 1950 election campaign, the leading figures of the Democrat Party used the slogan &quot;Geldi İsmet, kesildi kısmet&quot; (&quot;İsmet arrived, [our] fortune left&quot;). CHP lost the election with 41% of the vote against DP&#x27;s 55%, but due to the winner-takes-all electoral system, DP received 85% of the seats in parliament. İnönü presided over the peaceful transfer of power to the DP leaders, Bayar and Adnan Menderes. Bayar would serve as Turkey&#x27;s third president, and Menderes would be its first prime minister not from the CHP.

== Leader of the opposition (1950–1960) ==

For ten years, İnönü served as the leader of the opposition. In opposition, the CHP established its youth and women&#x27;s branches. On 22 June 1953, the establishment of trade unions and vocational chambers was proposed, and the right to strike for workers was added to the party program. The CHP formed an electoral alliance with the Republican Nation Party and Liberty party for the 1957 election, which was blocked by the DP government.

In the lead-up to the elections prepared for 1960, İnönü and CHP members faced regular harassment from the authorities and DP supporters, to the point where he was almost lynched several times. In 1958, the DP mayor of Zile declared martial law and mobilized the gendarmerie to prevent İnönü from conducting a rally in the city; a similar event happened in the city of Çankırı. In 1959, İnönü began a campaign tour that followed the same path he took thirty years ago as a Pasha from Uşak to İzmir and ended in victory for the Turkish nationalists. The DP minister of interior refused to promise protection to him. In Uşak, a crowd blocked İnönü from going to his podium, and he was hit in the head with a stone. Following his &quot;Great Offensive,&quot; he flew to Istanbul, where he was almost lynched by a DP-organized mob on the way to Topkapı Palace. He was also banned from speaking in rallies in Kayseri and Yeşilhisar.

İnönü was banned from 12 sessions of parliament. This coincided with an authoritarian turn of the Democrat Party, which culminated in a military coup.

== Later life (1961–1973) ==

The Turkish Armed Forces overthrew the government as a result of the military coup on 27 May 1960. After one year of junta rule in which the Democrat Party was banned and its top leaders executed in the Yassıada Trials, elections were held once the military returned to their barracks. İnönü returned to power as Prime Minister after the 1961 election, in which the CHP won the election. Right-wing parties have since continuously attacked İnönü and the CHP for their perceived involvement in the hanging of Prime minister Menderes, even though İnönü advocated for Menderes&#x27; pardoning.

İnönü&#x27;s governments were defined by an effort to deescalate tensions between radical forces in the Turkish army wishing for extended junta rule and former Democrats that wished for amnesty. İnönü&#x27;s CHP did not gain enough seats in the legislature to win a majority in the elections, so in an effort to create reconciliation, he formed coalition governments with the neo-Democrat Justice Party the New Turkey Party and the Republican Villagers Nation Party until 1965. Forming coalitions with DP successor parties, however, provoked radical officers into action. Colonel Talât Aydemir twice attempted to overthrow the government in 1962 and 1963 Turkish coup attempts. Aydemir was later executed for conducting both coups. Aydemir&#x27;s 1962 coup had the most potential to succeed when İnönü, President Cemal Gürsel and Chief of Staff Cevdet Sunay were held up in Çankaya Mansion by the putschists. Aydemir decided to let the group go, which foiled the coup.

While in coalition with the far-right Republican Villagers Nation Party, İnönü renounced the Greco-Turkish Treaty of Friendship of 1930 and took actions against the Greek minority. The Turkish government also strictly enforced a long-overlooked law barring Greek nationals from 30 professions and occupations; for example, Greeks could not be doctors, nurses, architects, shoemakers, tailors, plumbers, cabaret singers, ironsmiths, cooks, tourist guides, etc., and 50,000 more Greeks were deported. These actions were taken because of the growing anti-Greek sentiment in Turkey after the ethnic conflict in Cyprus flared up again. With an invasion of the island imminent, American President Lyndon Johnson sent a memorandum to İnönü, effectively vetoing Turkish intervention. A subsequent meeting at the White House between İnönü and Johnson on 22 June 1964, meant Cyprus&#x27; status quo continued for another ten years. An event a couple years earlier also strained the otherwise amicable relationship İnönü held with Washington D.C., namely the withdrawal of the nuclear-armed PGM-19 Jupiter MRBMs briefly stationed in Turkey, which was undertaken in the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis. While Washington withdrew the MRBMs, some B61 nuclear bombs are still stored in İncirlik Air Base.

İnönü&#x27;s governments established the National Security Council, Turkish Statistical Institute, and Turkey&#x27;s leading research institute, TÜBİTAK. Turkey signed the Ankara agreement, the first treaty of cooperation with the European Economic Community, and also increased ties with Iran and Pakistan. The army was modernized, and the National Intelligence Organization was founded. İnönü was instrumental in establishing CHP as &quot;Left of Center&quot; on the political spectrum as a new left-wing party cadre led by his protégé Bülent Ecevit became more influential. İnönü survived an assassination attempt from a Menderes supporter in 1964.

İnönü returned to the opposition after losing both the 1965 and 1969 general elections to a much younger man, Justice Party leader Süleyman Demirel. He remained leader of the CHP until 1972, when an interparty crisis over his endorsement of the 1971 military memorandum led to his defeat by Ecevit in the 5th extraordinary CHP convention. This was the first overthrow of a party leader in a leadership contest in the Republic&#x27;s history. İnönü left his party and resigned his parliamentarianship afterward. Being a former president he was a member of the Senate in the last year of his life.

== Death ==
On 25 December 1973, İsmet İnönü died of a heart attack at the age of 87. The parliament declared national mourning until his burial. He was interred at Anıtkabir opposite Atatürk&#x27;s mausoleum, on 28 December. Following the 1980 coup, Kenan Evren transferred twelve graves from Anıtkabir, but kept İnönü&#x27;s in place.

<text>Inorganic chemistry deals with synthesis and behavior of inorganic and organometallic compounds. This field covers chemical compounds that are not carbon-based, which are the subjects of organic chemistry. The distinction between the two disciplines is far from absolute, as there is much overlap in the subdiscipline of organometallic chemistry. It has applications in every aspect of the chemical industry, including catalysis, materials science, pigments, surfactants, coatings, medications, fuels, and agriculture.

==Occurrence==
Many inorganic compounds are found in nature as minerals. Soil may contain iron sulfide as pyrite or calcium sulfate as gypsum. Inorganic compounds are also found multitasking as biomolecules: as electrolytes (sodium chloride), in energy storage (ATP) or in construction (the polyphosphate backbone in DNA).

==Bonding==
Inorganic compounds exhibit a range of bonding properties. Some are ionic compounds, consisting of very simple cations and anions joined by ionic bonding. Examples of salts (which are ionic compounds) are magnesium chloride MgCl2, which consists of magnesium cations Mg2+ and chloride anions Cl−; or sodium hydroxide NaOH, which consists of sodium cations Na+ and hydroxide anions OH−. Some inorganic compounds are highly covalent, such as sulfur dioxide and iron pentacarbonyl. Many inorganic compounds feature polar covalent bonding, which is a form of bonding intermediate between covalent and ionic bonding. This description applies to many oxides, carbonates, and halides. Many inorganic compounds are characterized by high melting points. Some salts (e.g., NaCl) are very soluble in water.

When one reactant contains hydrogen atoms, a reaction can take place by exchanging protons in acid-base chemistry. In a more general definition, any chemical species capable of binding to electron pairs is called a Lewis acid; conversely any molecule that tends to donate an electron pair is referred to as a Lewis base. As a refinement of acid-base interactions, the HSAB theory takes into account polarizability and size of ions.

==Subdivisions of inorganic chemistry==
Subdivisions of inorganic chemistry are numerous, but include:
* organometallic chemistry, compounds with metal-carbon bonds. This area touches on organic synthesis, which employs many organometallic catalysts and reagents.
* cluster chemistry, compounds with several metals bound together with metal–metal bonds or bridging ligands.
* bioinorganic chemistry, biomolecules that contain metals. This area touches on medicinal chemistry.
* materials chemistry and solid state chemistry, extended (i.e. polymeric) solids exhibiting properties not seen for simple molecules. Many practical themes are associated with these areas, including ceramics.

===Industrial inorganic chemistry===
Inorganic chemistry is a highly practical area of science. Traditionally, the scale of a nation&#x27;s economy could be evaluated by their productivity of sulfuric acid.

An important man-made inorganic compound is ammonium nitrate, used for fertilization. The ammonia is produced through the Haber process. Nitric acid is prepared from the ammonia by oxidation. Another large-scale inorganic material is portland cement. Inorganic compounds are used as catalysts such as vanadium(V) oxide for the oxidation of sulfur dioxide and titanium(III) chloride for the polymerization of alkenes. Many inorganic compounds are used as reagents in organic chemistry such as lithium aluminium hydride.

==Descriptive inorganic chemistry==
Descriptive inorganic chemistry focuses on the classification of compounds based on their properties. Partly the classification focuses on the position in the periodic table of the heaviest element (the element with the highest atomic weight) in the compound, partly by grouping compounds by their structural similarities

===Coordination compounds===

Classical coordination compounds feature metals bound to &quot;lone pairs&quot; of electrons residing on the main group atoms of ligands such as H2O, NH3, Cl−, and CN−. In modern coordination compounds almost all organic and inorganic compounds can be used as ligands. The &quot;metal&quot; usually is a metal from the groups 3–13, as well as the &quot;trans&quot;-lanthanides and &quot;trans&quot;-actinides, but from a certain perspective, all chemical compounds can be described as coordination complexes.

The stereochemistry of coordination complexes can be quite rich, as hinted at by Werner&#x27;s separation of two enantiomers of [Co((OH)2Co(NH3)4)3]6+, an early demonstration that chirality is not inherent to organic compounds. A topical theme within this specialization is supramolecular coordination chemistry.
* Examples: [Co(EDTA)]−, [Co(NH3)6]3+, TiCl4(THF)2.

Coordination compounds show a rich diversity of structures, varying from tetrahedral for titanium (e.g., TiCl4) to square planar for some nickel complexes to octahedral for coordination complexes of cobalt. A range of transition metals can be found in biologically important compounds, such as iron in hemoglobin.
* Examples: iron pentacarbonyl, titanium tetrachloride, cisplatin

===Main group compounds===

These species feature elements from groups I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, 0 (excluding hydrogen) of the periodic table. Due to their often similar reactivity, the elements in group 3 (Sc, Y, and La) and group 12 (Zn, Cd, and Hg) are also generally included, and the lanthanides and actinides are sometimes included as well.

Main group compounds have been known since the beginnings of chemistry, e.g., elemental sulfur and the distillable white phosphorus. Experiments on oxygen, O2, by Lavoisier and Priestley not only identified an important diatomic gas, but opened the way for describing compounds and reactions according to stoichiometric ratios. The discovery of a practical synthesis of ammonia using iron catalysts by Carl Bosch and Fritz Haber in the early 1900s deeply impacted mankind, demonstrating the significance of inorganic chemical synthesis.
Typical main group compounds are SiO2, SnCl4, and N2O. Many main group compounds can also be classed as &quot;organometallic&quot;, as they contain organic groups, e.g., B(CH3)3). Main group compounds also occur in nature, e.g., phosphate in DNA, and therefore may be classed as bioinorganic. Conversely, organic compounds lacking (many) hydrogen ligands can be classed as &quot;inorganic&quot;, such as the fullerenes, buckytubes and binary carbon oxides.
* Examples: tetrasulfur tetranitride S4N4, diborane B2H6, silicones, buckminsterfullerene C60.

Noble gas compounds include several derivatives of xenon and krypton.
* Examples: xenon hexafluoride XeF6, xenon trioxide XeO3, and krypton difluoride KrF2

===Organometallic compounds===
 
Usually, organometallic compounds are considered to contain the M-C-H group. The metal (M) in these species can either be a main group element or a transition metal. Operationally, the definition of an organometallic compound is more relaxed to include also highly lipophilic complexes such as metal carbonyls and even metal alkoxides.

Organometallic compounds are mainly considered a special category because organic ligands are often sensitive to hydrolysis or oxidation, necessitating that organometallic chemistry employs more specialized preparative methods than was traditional in Werner-type complexes. Synthetic methodology, especially the ability to manipulate complexes in solvents of low coordinating power, enabled the exploration of very weakly coordinating ligands such as hydrocarbons, H2, and N2. Because the ligands are petrochemicals in some sense, the area of organometallic chemistry has greatly benefited from its relevance to industry.
* Examples: Cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer (C5H5)Fe(CO)2CH3, ferrocene Fe(C5H5)2, molybdenum hexacarbonyl Mo(CO)6, triethylborane Et3B, Tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) Pd2(dba)3)

===Cluster compounds===

Clusters can be found in all classes of chemical compounds. According to the commonly accepted definition, a cluster consists minimally of a triangular set of atoms that are directly bonded to each other. But metal–metal bonded dimetallic complexes are highly relevant to the area. Clusters occur in &quot;pure&quot; inorganic systems, organometallic chemistry, main group chemistry, and bioinorganic chemistry. The distinction between very large clusters and bulk solids is increasingly blurred. This interface is the chemical basis of nanoscience or nanotechnology and specifically arise from the study of quantum size effects in cadmium selenide clusters. Thus, large clusters can be described as an array of bound atoms intermediate in character between a molecule and a solid.
* Examples: Fe3(CO)12, B10H14, [Mo6Cl14]2−, 4Fe-4S

===Bioinorganic compounds===


By definition, these compounds occur in nature, but the subfield includes anthropogenic species, such as pollutants (e.g., methylmercury) and drugs (e.g., Cisplatin). The field, which incorporates many aspects of biochemistry, includes many kinds of compounds, e.g., the phosphates in DNA, and also metal complexes containing ligands that range from biological macromolecules, commonly peptides, to ill-defined species such as humic acid, and to water (e.g., coordinated to gadolinium complexes employed for MRI). Traditionally bioinorganic chemistry focuses on electron- and energy-transfer in proteins relevant to respiration. Medicinal inorganic chemistry includes the study of both non-essential and essential elements with applications to diagnosis and therapies.
* Examples: hemoglobin, methylmercury, carboxypeptidase

===Solid state compounds===
This important area focuses on structure, bonding, and the physical properties of materials. In practice, solid state inorganic chemistry uses techniques such as crystallography to gain an understanding of the properties that result from collective interactions between the subunits of the solid. Included in solid state chemistry are metals and their alloys or intermetallic derivatives. Related fields are condensed matter physics, mineralogy, and materials science.
* Examples: silicon chips, zeolites, YBa2Cu3O7

==Spectroscopy and magnetism==
In contrast to most organic compounds, many inorganic compounds are magnetic and/or colored. These properties provide information on the bonding and structure. The magnetism of inorganic compounds can be comlex. For example, most copper(II) compounds are paramagnetic but CuII2(OAc)4(H2O)2 is almost diamagnetic below room temperature. The explanation is due to magnetic coupling between pairs of Cu(II) sites in the acetate.

===Qualitative theories===
[[Crystal field theory]] explains why [[Ferricyanide|[FeIII(CN)6]3−]] has only one unpaired electron
Inorganic chemistry has greatly benefited from qualitative theories. Such theories are easier to learn as they require little background in quantum theory. Within main group compounds, VSEPR theory powerfully predicts, or at least rationalizes, the structures of main group compounds, such as an explanation for why NH3 is pyramidal whereas ClF3 is T-shaped. For the transition metals, crystal field theory allows one to understand the magnetism of many simple complexes, such as why [FeIII(CN)6]3− has only one unpaired electron, whereas [FeIII(H2O)6]3+ has five. A particularly powerful qualitative approach to assessing the structure and reactivity begins with classifying molecules according to electron counting, focusing on the numbers of valence electrons, usually at the central atom in a molecule.

===Molecular symmetry group theory===

A construct in chemistry is molecular symmetry, as embodied in Group theory. Inorganic compounds display a particularly diverse symmetries, so it is logical that Group Theory is intimately associated with inorganic chemistry. Group theory provides the language to describe the shapes of molecules according to their point group symmetry. Group theory also enables factoring and simplification of theoretical calculations.

Spectroscopic features are analyzed and described with respect to the symmetry properties of the, &quot;inter alia&quot;, vibrational or electronic states. Knowledge of the symmetry properties of the ground and excited states allows one to predict the numbers and intensities of absorptions in vibrational and electronic spectra. A classic application of group theory is the prediction of the number of C–O vibrations in substituted metal carbonyl complexes. The most common applications of symmetry to spectroscopy involve vibrational and electronic spectra.

Group theory highlights commonalities and differences in the bonding of otherwise disparate species. For example, the metal-based orbitals transform identically for WF6 and W(CO)6, but the energies and populations of these orbitals differ significantly. A similar relationship exists CO2 and molecular beryllium difluoride.

==Thermodynamics and inorganic chemistry==
An alternative quantitative approach to inorganic chemistry focuses on energies of reactions. This approach is highly traditional and empirical, but it is also useful. Broad concepts that are couched in thermodynamic terms include redox potential, acidity, phase changes. A classic concept in inorganic thermodynamics is the Born–Haber cycle, which is used for assessing the energies of elementary processes such as electron affinity, some of which cannot be observed directly.

==Mechanistic inorganic chemistry==
An important aspect of inorganic chemistry focuses on reaction pathways, i.e. reaction mechanisms.

===Main group elements and lanthanides===
The mechanisms of main group compounds of groups 13–18 are usually discussed in the context of organic chemistry (organic compounds are main group compounds, after all). Elements heavier than C, N, O, and F often form compounds with more electrons than predicted by the octet rule, as explained in the article on hypervalent molecules. The mechanisms of their reactions differ from organic compounds for this reason. Elements lighter than carbon (B, Be, Li) as well as Al and Mg often form electron-deficient structures that are electronically akin to carbocations. Such electron-deficient species tend to react via associative pathways. The chemistry of the lanthanides mirrors many aspects of chemistry seen for aluminium.

===Transition metal complexes===
Transition metal and main group compounds often react differently. The important role of d-orbitals in bonding strongly influences the pathways and rates of ligand substitution and dissociation. These themes are covered in articles on coordination chemistry and ligand. Both associative and dissociative pathways are observed.

An overarching aspect of mechanistic transition metal chemistry is the kinetic lability of the complex illustrated by the exchange of free and bound water in the prototypical complexes [M(H2O)6]n+:
:[M(H2O)6]n+ + 6 H2O* → [M(H2O*)6]n+ + 6 H2O
:where H2O* denotes isotopically enriched water, e.g., H217O
The rates of water exchange varies by 20 orders of magnitude across the periodic table, with lanthanide complexes at one extreme and Ir(III) species being the slowest.

====Redox reactions====
Redox reactions are prevalent for the transition elements. Two classes of redox reaction are considered: atom-transfer reactions, such as oxidative addition/reductive elimination, and electron-transfer. A fundamental redox reaction is &quot;self-exchange&quot;, which involves the degenerate reaction between an oxidant and a reductant. For example, permanganate and its one-electron reduced relative manganate exchange one electron:
:[MnO4]− + [Mn*O4]2− → [MnO4]2− + [Mn*O4]−

====Reactions at ligands====
Coordinated ligands display reactivity distinct from the free ligands. For example, the acidity of the ammonia ligands in [Co(NH3)6]3+ is elevated relative to NH3 itself. Alkenes bound to metal cations are reactive toward nucleophiles whereas alkenes normally are not. The large and industrially important area of catalysis hinges on the ability of metals to modify the reactivity of organic ligands. Homogeneous catalysis occurs in solution and heterogeneous catalysis occurs when gaseous or dissolved substrates interact with surfaces of solids. Traditionally homogeneous catalysis is considered part of organometallic chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis is discussed in the context of surface science, a subfield of solid state chemistry. But the basic inorganic chemical principles are the same. Transition metals, almost uniquely, react with small molecules such as CO, H2, O2, and C2H4. The industrial significance of these feedstocks drives the active area of catalysis. Ligands can also undergo ligand transfer reactions such as transmetalation.

==Characterization of inorganic compounds==
Because of the diverse range of elements and the correspondingly diverse properties of the resulting derivatives, inorganic chemistry is closely associated with many methods of analysis. Older methods tended to examine bulk properties such as the electrical conductivity of solutions, melting points, solubility, and acidity. With the advent of quantum theory and the corresponding expansion of electronic apparatus, new tools have been introduced to probe the electronic properties of inorganic molecules and solids. Often these measurements provide insights relevant to theoretical models. Commonly encountered techniques are:
* X-ray crystallography: This technique allows for the 3D determination of molecular structures.
* Various forms of spectroscopy:
** Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy: Historically, this has been an important tool, since many inorganic compounds are strongly colored
** NMR spectroscopy: Besides 1H and 13C many other NMR-active nuclei (e.g., 11B, 19F, 31P, and 195Pt) can give important information on compound properties and structure. The NMR of paramagnetic species can provide important structural information. Proton (1H) NMR is also important because the light hydrogen nucleus is not easily detected by X-ray crystallography.
** Infrared spectroscopy: Mostly for absorptions from carbonyl ligands
** Electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy
** Mössbauer spectroscopy
** Electron-spin resonance: ESR (or EPR) allows for the measurement of the environment of paramagnetic metal centres.
* Electrochemistry: Cyclic voltammetry and related techniques probe the redox characteristics of compounds.

==Synthetic inorganic chemistry==
Although some inorganic species can be obtained in pure form from nature, most are synthesized in chemical plants and in the laboratory.

Inorganic synthetic methods can be classified roughly according to the volatility or solubility of the component reactants. Soluble inorganic compounds are prepared using methods of organic synthesis. For metal-containing compounds that are reactive toward air, Schlenk line and glove box techniques are followed. Volatile compounds and gases are manipulated in &quot;vacuum manifolds&quot; consisting of glass piping interconnected through valves, the entirety of which can be evacuated to 0.001 mm Hg or less. Compounds are condensed using liquid nitrogen (b.p. 78K) or other cryogens. Solids are typically prepared using tube furnaces, the reactants and products being sealed in containers, often made of fused silica (amorphous SiO2) but sometimes more specialized materials such as welded Ta tubes or Pt &quot;boats&quot;. Products and reactants are transported between temperature zones to drive reactions.

<text>In film, an insert is a shot of part of a scene as filmed from a different angle and/or focal length from the master shot. Inserts cover action already covered in the master shot, but emphasize a different aspect of that action due to the different framing. An insert differs from a cutaway as cutaways cover action &quot;not&quot; covered in the master shot.

There are more exact terms to use when the new, inserted shot is another view of actors: close-up, head shot, knee shot, two shot. So the term &quot;insert&quot; is often confined to views of objects—and body parts, other than the head. Often inserts of this sort are done separately from the main action, by a second-unit director using stand-ins.

Inserts and cutaways can both be vexatious for directors, as care must be taken to preserve continuity by keeping the objects in the same relative position as in the main take, and having the lighting be the same.

== In popular culture ==
The 1975 movie &quot;Inserts&quot; directed by John Byrum about a pornographic film production, which starred Richard Dreyfuss and was originally released with an X rating, took its name from the double meaning that &quot;insert&quot; both refers to this film technique (often used in pornographic filmmaking) and to sexual intercourse.

<text>Ernst Ingmar Bergman (14 July 1918 – 30 July 2007) was a Swedish film and theatre director and screenwriter. Widely considered one of the greatest and most influential film directors of all time, his films have been described as &quot;profoundly personal meditations into the myriad struggles facing the psyche and the soul&quot;. Among his most acclaimed works are &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; (1957), &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot; (1957), &quot;Persona&quot; (1966) and &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; (1982), which were included in the 2012 edition of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; Greatest Films of All Time. He was also ranked No. 8 on the magazine&#x27;s 2002 &quot;Greatest Directors of All Time&quot; list. Other notable works include &quot;Sawdust and Tinsel&quot; (1953), &quot;A Lesson in Love&quot; (1954), &quot;Smiles of a Summer Night&quot; (1955), &quot;The Virgin Spring&quot; (1960), &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; (1961), &quot;Winter Light&quot; and &quot;The Silence&quot; (both 1963), &quot;Shame&quot; (1968), &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; (1972), &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot; (1973) and &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; (1978). 

Bergman directed more than 60 films and documentaries, most of which he also wrote, for both cinema releases and television screenings. Most of his films were set in Sweden, and many of his films from 1961 onward were filmed on the island of Fårö. He forged a creative partnership with his cinematographers Gunnar Fischer and Sven Nykvist. Bergman also had a theatrical career that included periods as Leading Director of Sweden&#x27;s Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm and of Germany&#x27;s Residenztheater in Munich. He directed more than 170 plays. Among his company of actors were Harriet Andersson, Bibi Andersson, Liv Ullmann, Gunnar Björnstrand, Erland Josephson, Ingrid Thulin, Gunnel Lindblom and Max von Sydow.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ernst Ingmar Bergman was born in Uppsala on 14 July 1918, the son of nurse Karin (née Åkerblom) and Lutheran minister (and later chaplain to the King of Sweden) Erik Bergman. His mother was of Walloon descent. The Bergman family was originally from Järvsö. On his father&#x27;s side, Bergman was a descendant of the noble Bröms, Ehrenskiöld, and Stockenström clergy families of Finnish, German, and Swedish origin. His father also descended from the German noble families and de Frese introduced at the Swedish Riddarhuset. Bergman&#x27;s paternal grandmother and maternal grandfather were cousins, making his parents second cousins. On his mother&#x27;s side, he was descended from Dutch merchant Paul Calwagen, who left Holland for Sweden in the 17th century; Paul&#x27;s Dutch-Swedish wife, Maria van der Hagen, was a descendant of the court painter Laurens van der Plas. Bergman&#x27;s mother was also a descendant of the noble Tigerschiöld and Weinholz families, as well as the family.
Bergman grew up with his older brother Dag and younger sister Margareta surrounded by religious imagery and discussion. His father was a conservative parish minister with strict ideas of parenting. Ingmar was locked up in dark closets for infractions such as wetting himself. &quot;While father preached away in the pulpit and the congregation prayed, sang, or listened&quot;, Ingmar wrote in his autobiography &quot;Laterna Magica&quot;, &quot;I devoted my interest to the church&#x27;s mysterious world of low arches, thick walls, the smell of eternity, the coloured sunlight quivering above the strangest vegetation of medieval paintings and carved figures on ceilings and walls. There was everything that one&#x27;s imagination could desire—angels, saints, dragons, prophets, devils, humans...&quot; Although raised in a devout Lutheran household, Bergman later stated that he lost his faith at age eight, and came to terms with this fact while making &quot;Winter Light&quot; in 1962. His interest in theatre and film began early; at the age of nine, he traded a set of tin soldiers for a magic lantern. Within a year, he had created a private world by playing with this toy in which he felt completely at home. He fashioned his own scenery, marionettes, and lighting effects and gave puppet productions of Strindberg plays in which he spoke all the parts.&quot;

Bergman attended the Palmgren School as a teenager. His school years were unhappy, and he remembered them unfavourably in later years. In a 1944 letter concerning the film &quot;Torment&quot; (sometimes known as &quot;Frenzy&quot;), which sparked debate on the condition of Swedish high schools (and which Bergman had written), the school&#x27;s principal Henning Håkanson wrote, among other things, that Bergman had been a &quot;problem child&quot;. Bergman wrote in a response that he had strongly disliked the emphasis on homework and testing in his formal schooling.

In 1934, aged 16, he was sent to Germany to spend the summer holidays with family friends. He attended a Nazi rally in Weimar at which he saw Adolf Hitler. He later wrote in &quot;Laterna Magica&quot; (&quot;The Magic Lantern&quot;) about the visit to Germany, describing how the German family had put a portrait of Hitler on the wall by his bed, and that &quot;for many years, I was on Hitler&#x27;s side, delighted by his success and saddened by his defeats&quot;. Bergman commented that &quot;Hitler was unbelievably charismatic. He electrified the crowd. ... The Nazism I had seen seemed fun and youthful.&quot; Bergman did two five-month stretches of mandatory military service in Sweden. He later reflected, &quot;When the doors to the concentration camps were thrown open ... I was suddenly ripped of my innocence.&quot;

Bergman enrolled at Stockholm University College (later renamed Stockholm University) in 1937, to study art and literature. He spent most of his time involved in student theatre and became a &quot;genuine movie addict&quot;. At the same time, a romantic involvement led to a physical confrontation with his father which resulted in a break in their relationship which lasted for many years. Although he did not graduate from the university, he wrote a number of plays and an opera, and became an assistant director at a local theatre. In 1942, he was given the opportunity to direct one of his own scripts, &quot;Caspar&#x27;s Death&quot;. The play was seen by members of Svensk Filmindustri, which then offered Bergman a position working on scripts. He married Else Fisher in 1943.

===Film career until 1975===

Bergman&#x27;s film career began in 1941 with his work rewriting scripts, but his first major accomplishment was in 1944 when he wrote the screenplay for &quot;Torment&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Frenzy&quot;) (&quot;Hets&quot;), a film directed by Alf Sjöberg. Along with writing the screenplay, he was also appointed assistant director of the film. In his second autobiographical book, &quot;Images: My Life in Film&quot;, Bergman describes the filming of the exteriors as his actual film directorial debut. The film sparked debate on Swedish formal education. When Henning Håkanson (the principal of the high school Bergman had attended) wrote a letter following the film&#x27;s release, Bergman, according to scholar Frank Gado, disparaged in a response what he viewed as Håkanson&#x27;s implication that students &quot;who did not fit some arbitrary prescription of worthiness deserved the system&#x27;s cruel neglect&quot;. Bergman also stated in the letter that he &quot;hated school as a principle, as a system and as an institution. And as such I have definitely not wanted to criticize my own school, but all schools.&quot; The international success of this film led to Bergman&#x27;s first opportunity to direct a year later. During the next ten years he wrote and directed more than a dozen films, including &quot;Prison&quot; (&quot;Fängelse&quot;) in 1949, as well as &quot;Sawdust and Tinsel&quot; (&quot;Gycklarnas afton&quot;) and &quot;Summer with Monika&quot; (&quot;Sommaren med Monika&quot;), both released in 1953.

Bergman first achieved worldwide success with &quot;Smiles of a Summer Night&quot; (&quot;Sommarnattens leende&quot;, 1955), which won for &quot;Best poetic humour&quot; and was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes the following year. This was followed by &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; (&quot;Det sjunde inseglet&quot;) and &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot; (&quot;Smultronstället&quot;), released in Sweden ten months apart in 1957. &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; won a special jury prize and was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes, and &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot; won numerous awards for Bergman and its star, Victor Sjöström. Bergman continued to be productive for the next two decades. From the early 1960s, he spent much of his life on the island of Fårö, where he made several films.

In the early 1960s he directed three films that explored the theme of faith and doubt in God, &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; (&quot;Såsom i en Spegel&quot;, 1961), &quot;Winter Light&quot; (&quot;Nattvardsgästerna&quot;, 1962), and &quot;The Silence&quot; (&quot;Tystnaden&quot;, 1963). Critics created the notion that the common themes in these three films made them a trilogy or cinematic triptych. Bergman initially responded that he did not plan these three films as a trilogy and that he could not see any common motifs in them, but he later seemed to adopt the notion, with some equivocation. His parody of the films of Federico Fellini, &quot;All These Women&quot; (&quot;För att inte tala om alla dessa kvinnor&quot;) was released in 1964.

&quot;Persona&quot; (1966), starring Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann, is a film Bergman considered one of his most important works. While the highly experimental film won few awards, it has been considered his masterpiece. Other films of the period include &quot;The Virgin Spring&quot; (&quot;Jungfrukällan&quot;, 1960), &quot;Hour of the Wolf&quot; (&quot;Vargtimmen&quot;, 1968), &quot;Shame&quot; (&quot;Skammen&quot;, 1968) and &quot;The Passion of Anna&quot; (&quot;En Passion&quot;, 1969). With his cinematographer Sven Nykvist, Bergman made use of a crimson color scheme for &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; (1972), which received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture. He also produced extensively for Swedish television at this time. Two works of note were &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot; (&quot;Scener ur ett äktenskap&quot;, 1973) and &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (&quot;Trollflöjten&quot;, 1975).
===Tax evasion charges in 1976===
On 30 January 1976, while rehearsing August Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;The Dance of Death&quot; at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm, he was arrested by two plainclothes police officers and charged with income tax evasion. The impact of the event on Bergman was devastating. He suffered a nervous breakdown as a result of the humiliation, and was hospitalised in a state of deep depression.

The investigation was focused on an alleged 1970 transaction of 500,000 Swedish kronor (SEK) between Bergman&#x27;s Swedish company &quot;Cinematograf&quot; and its Swiss subsidiary &quot;Persona&quot;, an entity that was mainly used for the paying of salaries to foreign actors. Bergman dissolved &quot;Persona&quot; in 1974 after having been notified by the Swedish Central Bank and subsequently reported the income. On 23 March 1976, the special prosecutor Anders Nordenadler dropped the charges against Bergman, saying that the alleged crime had no legal basis, and added that it would be like bringing &quot;charges against a person who has stolen his own car, thinking it was someone else&#x27;s&quot;. Director General Gösta S Ekman, chief of the Swedish Internal Revenue Service, defended the failed investigation, saying that the investigation was dealing with important legal material and that Bergman was treated just like any other suspect. He expressed regret that Bergman had left the country, hoping that Bergman was a &quot;stronger&quot; person now when the investigation had shown that he had not done any wrong.

Although the charges were dropped, Bergman became disconsolate, fearing he would never again return to directing. Despite pleas by the Swedish prime minister Olof Palme, high public figures, and leaders of the film industry, he vowed never to work in Sweden again. He closed down his studio on the island of Fårö, suspended two announced film projects, and went into self-imposed exile in Munich, West Germany. Harry Schein, director of the Swedish Film Institute, estimated the immediate damage as ten million SEK (kronor) and hundreds of jobs lost.

===Aftermath following arrest===
Bergman then briefly considered the possibility of working in America; his next film, &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Egg&quot; (1977) was a West German-U.S. production and his second English-language film (the first being &quot;The Touch&quot;, 1971). This was followed by a British-Norwegian co-production, &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; (&quot;Höstsonaten&quot;, 1978) starring Ingrid Bergman (no relation) and Liv Ullmann, and &quot;From the Life of the Marionettes&quot; (&quot;Aus dem Leben der Marionetten&quot;, 1980) which was a British-West German co-production.

He temporarily returned to his homeland to direct &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; (&quot;Fanny och Alexander&quot;, 1982). Bergman stated that the film would be his last, and that afterwards he would focus on directing theatre. After that he wrote several film scripts and directed a number of television specials. As with previous work for television, some of these productions were later theatrically released. The last such work was &quot;Saraband&quot; (2003), a sequel to &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot; and directed by Bergman when he was 84 years old.

Although he continued to operate from Munich, by mid-1978 Bergman had overcome some of his bitterness toward the Swedish government. In July of that year he visited Sweden, celebrating his sixtieth birthday on the island of Fårö, and partly resumed his work as a director at Royal Dramatic Theatre. To honour his return, the Swedish Film Institute launched a new Ingmar Bergman Prize to be awarded annually for excellence in filmmaking. Still, he remained in Munich until 1984. In one of the last major interviews with Bergman, conducted in 2005 on the island of Fårö, Bergman said that despite being active during the exile, he had effectively lost eight years of his professional life.

===Retirement and death===

Bergman retired from filmmaking in December 2003. He had hip surgery in October 2006 and was making a difficult recovery. He died in his sleep at age 89; his body was found at his home on the island of Fårö, on 30 July 2007. It was the same day another renowned existentialist film director, Michelangelo Antonioni, died. The interment was private, at the Fårö Church on 18 August 2007. A place in the Fårö churchyard was prepared for him under heavy secrecy. Although he was buried on the island of Fårö, his name and date of birth were inscribed under his wife&#x27;s name on a tomb at Roslagsbro churchyard, Norrtälje Municipality, several years before his death.

==Style of working==
===Repertory company===
Bergman developed a personal &quot;repertory company&quot; of Swedish actors whom he repeatedly cast in his films, including Max von Sydow, Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson, Erland Josephson, Ingrid Thulin, Gunnel Lindblom, and Gunnar Björnstrand, each of whom appeared in at least five Bergman features. Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann, who appeared in nine of Bergman&#x27;s films and one televisual film (&quot;Saraband&quot;), was the last to join this group (in the film &quot;Persona&quot;), and ultimately became the most closely associated with Bergman, both artistically and personally. They had a daughter together, Linn Ullmann (born 1966).

In Bergman&#x27;s working arrangement with Sven Nykvist, his best-known cinematographer, the two men developed sufficient rapport to allow Bergman not to worry about the composition of a shot until the day before it was filmed. On the morning of the shoot, he would briefly speak to Nykvist about the mood and composition he hoped for, and then leave Nykvist to work, lacking interruption or comment until post-production discussion of the next day&#x27;s work.

===Financing===
By Bergman&#x27;s own account, he never had a problem with funding. He cited two reasons for this: one, that he did not live in the United States, which he viewed as obsessed with box-office earnings; and two, that his films tended to be low-budget affairs. (&quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;, for instance, was finished for about $450,000, while &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot;, a six-episode television feature, cost only $200,000.)

===Technique===
Bergman usually wrote his films&#x27; screenplays, thinking about them for months or years before starting the actual process of writing, which he viewed as somewhat tedious. His earlier films are carefully constructed and are either based on his plays or written in collaboration with other authors. Bergman stated that in his later works, when on occasion his actors would want to do things differently from his own intention, he would let them, noting that the results were often &quot;disastrous&quot; when he did not do so. As his career progressed, Bergman increasingly let his actors improvise their dialogue. In his later films, he wrote just the ideas informing the scene and allowed his actors to determine the exact dialogue. When viewing daily rushes, Bergman stressed the importance of being critical but unemotive, claiming that he asked himself not if the work was great or terrible, but rather if it was sufficient or needed to be reshot.

===Subjects===
Bergman&#x27;s films usually deal with existential questions of mortality, loneliness, and religious faith. In addition to these cerebral topics, however, sexual desire features in the foreground of most of his films, whether the central event is medieval plague (&quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;), upper-class family activity in early twentieth century Uppsala (&quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot;), or contemporary alienation (&quot;The Silence&quot;). His female characters are usually more in touch with their sexuality than their male equivalents, and unafraid to proclaim it, sometimes with breathtaking overtness (as in &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;) as would define the work of &quot;the conjurer,&quot; as Bergman called himself in a 1960 &quot;TIME&quot; cover story. In an interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1964, he said: &quot;The manifestation of sex is very important, and particularly to me, for above all, I don&#x27;t want to make merely intellectual films. I want audiences to feel, to sense my films. This to me is much more important than their understanding them.&quot; Film, Bergman said, was his demanding mistress. While he was a social democrat as an adult, Bergman stated that &quot;as an artist I&#x27;m not politically involved ... I don&#x27;t make propaganda for either one attitude or the other.&quot;

===Bergman&#x27;s views on his career===
When asked in the series of interviews later titled &quot;Ingmar Bergman – 3 dokumentärer om film, teater, Fårö och livet&quot; conducted by Marie Nyreröd for Swedish TV and released in 2004, Bergman said that of his works, he held &quot;Winter Light&quot;, &quot;Persona&quot;, and &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; in the highest regard. There he also states that he managed to push the envelope of film making in the films &quot;Persona&quot; and &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;. Bergman stated on numerous occasions (for example in the interview book &quot;Bergman on Bergman&quot;) that &quot;The Silence&quot; meant the end of the era in which religious questions were a major concern of his films. Bergman said that he would get depressed by his own films: &quot;jittery and ready to cry... and miserable.&quot; In the same interview he also stated: &quot;If there is one thing I miss about working with films, it is working with Sven&quot; (Nykvist), the third cinematographer with whom he had collaborated.

===Theatrical work===

Although Bergman was universally famous for his contribution to cinema, he was also an active and productive stage director throughout his life. During his studies at what was then Stockholm University College, he became active in its student theatre, where he made a name for himself early on. His first work after graduation was as a trainee-director at a Stockholm theatre. At twenty-six years, he became the youngest theatrical manager in Europe at the Helsingborg City Theatre. He stayed at Helsingborg for three years and then became the director at Gothenburg city theatre from 1946 to 1949.

He became director of the Malmö City Theatre in 1953, and remained for seven years. Many of his star actors were people with whom he began working on stage. He was the director of the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm from 1960 to 1966, and manager from 1963 to 1966, where he began a long-time collaboration with choreographer Donya Feuer.

After Bergman left Sweden because of the tax evasion incident, he became director of the &quot;Residenz Theatre&quot; of Munich, West Germany (1977–1984). He remained active in theatre throughout the 1990s and made his final production on stage with Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts&quot; at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2003.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===

Bergman was married five times:
*25 March 1943 – 1945, to Else Fisher (1 March 1918 – 3 March 2006), choreographer and dancer (divorced). Children:
**Lena Bergman, actress, born 1943.
*22 July 1945 – 1950, to Ellen Lundström (23 April 1919 – 6 March 2007), choreographer and film director (divorced). Children:
**Eva Bergman, film director, born 1945
**Jan Bergman, film director (1946–2000)
**the twins Mats and Anna Bergman, both actors and film directors, born in 1948.
*1951 – 1959, to Gun Grut (1916–1971), journalist (divorced). Children:
**Ingmar Bergman Jr., retired airline captain, born 1951.
*1959 – 1969, to Käbi Laretei (14 July 1922 – 31 October 2014), concert pianist (divorced). Children:
**Daniel Bergman, film director, born 1962.
*11 November 1971 – 20 May 1995, to Ingrid von Rosen (maiden name Karlebo). Children:
**Maria von Rosen, author, born 1959.
The first four marriages ended in divorce, while the last ended when his wife Ingrid died of stomach cancer in 1995, aged 65. Aside from his marriages, Bergman had romantic relationships with actresses Harriet Andersson (1952–1955), Bibi Andersson (1955–1959), and Liv Ullmann (1965–1970). He was the father of writer Linn Ullmann with Ullmann. In all, Bergman had nine children, one of whom predeceased him. Bergman eventually married all the mothers of his children, with the exception of Liv Ullmann. His daughter with his last wife, Ingrid von Rosen, was born twelve years before their marriage. He had dozens of mistresses throughout his life and would justify the affairs to his various wives by telling them: &quot;I have so many lives.&quot;

Although Bergman once described himself as one who had lost his faith in an afterlife, in 2000 he stated that a conversation he had with Erland Josephson helped him to believe that he would see Ingrid again. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m not actually afraid of dying. On the contrary, really. I think it&#x27;ll be interesting.&quot; In 2012, Max von Sydow stated in an interview with Charlie Rose that he had had many discussions with Bergman about religion which seemed to indicate that Bergman believed in an afterlife, with von Sydow even claiming that Bergman contacted him after his passing to prove there was indeed a life after death, though he chose not to elaborate further on the exact meaning of the statement. 

In an early draft of his autobiography, Bergman admitted to raping his then-girlfriend Karin Lannby. The portion was edited out for the final version. 

===Health===
Bergman suffered from insomnia and severe stomach problems dating back to childhood. He called his nervous stomach &quot;a calamity as foolish as it is humiliating&quot; and joked that the private lavatories he secured at the theatres in which he worked represented his &quot;most lasting contribution to the history of theatre.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==

In 1958, he won the Best Director award for &quot;Brink of Life&quot; at the Cannes Film Festival, and won the Golden Bear for &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot; at the Berlin International Film Festival. In 1960 Bergman was featured in the cover of &quot;Time&quot;, the first foreign-language filmmaker to do so since Leni Riefenstahl in 1936. In 1971, Bergman received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award at the Academy Awards ceremony. Three of his films (&quot;The Virgin Spring&quot;, &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot;, and &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot;) won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. In 1997, he was awarded the Palme des Palmes (Palm of the Palms) at the 50th anniversary of the Cannes Film Festival. He won many other awards and has been nominated for numerous other awards.

Academy Awards
==Legacy==

In 1996, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Bergman at No. 8 in its &quot;50 Greatest Directors&quot; list.
In 2002, Bergman was listed at number nine on the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; list of the top ten film directors of modern times. 
MovieMaker magazine ranked Bergman at No. 13 on their 2002 list of &quot;The 25 Most Influential Directors of All Time&quot;. 
Bergman was ranked at No. 36 on Empire magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top 40 Greatest Directors of All-Time&quot; list in 2005. In 2007, &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine ranked Bergman at No. 7 on its &quot;100 Greatest Film Directors Ever&quot; list.
In 2017, &quot;New York&quot; magazine ranked Bergman at number 55 on their list of &quot;The 100 Best Screenwriters of All Time&quot;. 

Stanley Kubrick admired the work of Bergman and expressed it in personal letter: &quot;Your vision of life has moved me deeply, much more deeply than I have ever been moved by any films. I believe you are the greatest film-maker at work today [...], unsurpassed by anyone in the creation of mood and atmosphere, the subtlety of performance, the avoidance of the obvious, the truthfulness and completeness of characterization. To this one must also add everything else that goes into the making of a film; [...] and I shall look forward with eagerness to each of your films.&quot; Film critic Philip French referred to Bergman as &quot;one of the greatest artists of the 20th century ... he found in literature and the performing arts a way of both recreating and questioning the human condition.&quot; Director Martin Scorsese commented that &quot;it&#x27;s impossible to overestimate the effect that [his] films had on people.&quot; Terrence Rafferty of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that throughout the 1960s, when Bergman &quot;was considered pretty much the last word in cinematic profundity, his every tic was scrupulously pored over, analyzed, elaborated in ingenious arguments about identity, the nature of film, the fate of the artist in the modern world and so on.&quot;

Bergman&#x27;s work was a point of reference and inspiration for director Woody Allen. He described Bergman as &quot;probably the greatest film artist, all things considered, since the invention of the motion picture camera&quot;. Bergman&#x27;s films are mentioned and praised in &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and other Allen films. Allen also admired Bergman&#x27;s longtime director of photography Sven Nykvist and invited him to return as his DP on &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;. Danish Director Thomas Vinterberg has cited Bergman as one of his major influences, &quot;Bergman is always in my head. He is part of my upbringing and I was fortunate to meet him and get advice from him.&quot; Writer and director Richard Ayoade counts Bergman as one of his inspirations. In 2017, the British Film Institute (BFI) hosted an Ingmar Bergman season and Ayoade said in a &quot;Guardian&quot; interview that he saw everything in it, &quot;which was one of the best two months ever.&quot; The BFI&#x27;s programme included a discussion with Ayoade on Bergman&#x27;s 1966 film, &quot;Persona&quot;, before a screening.

Bertrand Tavernier said: &quot;Bergman was the first to bring metaphysicsreligion, death, existentialismto the screen. But the best of Bergman is the way he speaks of women, of the relationship between men and women. He&#x27;s like a miner digging in search of purity.&quot;

After Bergman died, a large archive of notes was donated to the Swedish Film Institute. Among the notes are several unpublished and unfinished scripts both for stage and films, and many more ideas for works in different stages of development. A never-performed play has the title &quot;Kärlek utan älskare&quot; (&quot;Love without lovers&quot;), and has the note &quot;Complete disaster!&quot; written on the envelope; the play is about a director who disappears and an editor who tries to complete a work he has left unfinished. Other canceled projects include the script for a pornographic film which Bergman abandoned since he did not think it was alive enough, a play about a cannibal, some loose scenes set inside a womb, a film about the life of Jesus, a film about &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, and a play with the title &quot;Från sperm till spöke&quot; (&quot;From sperm to spook&quot;). The Swedish director Marcus Lindeen went through the material, and inspired by &quot;Kärlek utan älskare&quot; he took samples from many of the works and turned them into a play, titled &quot;Arkivet för orealiserbara drömmar och visioner&quot; (&quot;The archive for unrealisable dreams and visions&quot;). Lindeen&#x27;s play premiered on 28 May 2012 at the Stockholm City Theatre.

In 2018, in honor of Bergman&#x27;s 100th birthday, The Criterion Collection compiled and released a Blu-ray disc box set comprising 39 of Bergman&#x27;s features. The set spans Bergman&#x27;s early career, beginning in the 1940s, up to his final film in 2003. The films are organized non-chronologically, and are instead presented in four groupings that mimic the procession of a film festival. Accompanying the discs is a book featuring critical essays on each of the films, intended to guide the viewer through the experience. Upon its release, &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Glenn Kenny assessed the set as &quot;impressive and almost exhaustive&quot;, and interpreted it as &quot;a fresh case for [Bergman&#x27;s] continuing importance&quot;, in response to criticisms such as Jonathan Rosenbaum&#x27;s 2007 opinion piece &quot;Scenes From an Overrated Career&quot;.

The Ingmar Bergman International Debut Award is awarded annually at the Gothenburg Film Festival, in partnership with the Ingmar Bergman Foundation, the Bergman Estate and the Bergman Center on Fårö. The prize includes a visit to the Bergman Estate as well as to Bergmans personal archive in Stockholm.

<text>Sir Isaac Newton (; ) was an English polymath active as a mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author. Newton was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment that followed. His book (&quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot;), first published in 1687, achieved the first great unification in physics and established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for formulating infinitesimal calculus, though he developed calculus years before Leibniz. He contributed to and refined the scientific method, and his work is considered the most influential in bringing forth modern science.

In the , Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. He used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System&#x27;s heliocentricity. Newton solved the two-body problem, and introduced the three-body problem. He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton&#x27;s inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, thereby convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.

Newton built the first reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. His work on light was collected in his book &quot;Opticks&quot;, published in 1704. He originated prisms as beam expanders and multiple-prism arrays, which would later become integral to the development of tunable lasers. Newton also formulated an empirical law of cooling, which was the first heat transfer formulation and serves as the formal basis of convective heat transfer, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the notions of a Newtonian fluid and a black body. Furthermore, he made early investigations into electricity, with an idea from his book &quot;Opticks&quot; arguably the beginning of the field theory of the electric force. In addition to his creation of calculus, as a mathematician, he generalized the binomial theorem to any real number, contributed to the study of power series, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, classified most of the cubic plane curves, and also originated the Newton-Cotes formulas for numerical integration. He further initiated the field of calculus of variations, and devised an early form of regression analysis.

Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge; he was appointed at the age of 26. He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. He refused to take holy orders in the Church of England, unlike most members of the Cambridge faculty of the day. Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. Politically and personally tied to the Whig party, Newton served two brief terms as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge, in 1689–1690 and 1701–1702. He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as Warden (1696–1699) and Master (1699–1727) of the Royal Mint, in which he increased the accuracy and security of British coinage, as well as president of the Royal Society (1703–1727).

== Early life ==

Isaac Newton was born (according to the Julian calendar in use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 (NS 4 January 1643) at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire. His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before. Born prematurely, Newton was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a quart mug. When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough (née Blythe). Newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: &quot;Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them.&quot; Newton&#x27;s mother had three children (Mary, Benjamin, and Hannah) from her second marriage.

=== The King&#x27;s School ===
From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King&#x27;s School in Grantham, which taught Latin and Ancient Greek and probably imparted a significant foundation of mathematics. He was removed from school by his mother and returned to Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth by October 1659. His mother, widowed for the second time, attempted to make him a farmer, an occupation he hated. Henry Stokes, master at The King&#x27;s School, persuaded his mother to send him back to school. Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student, distinguishing himself mainly by building sundials and models of windmills.

=== University of Cambridge ===
In June 1661, Newton was admitted to Trinity College at the University of Cambridge. His uncle the Reverend William Ayscough, who had studied at Cambridge, recommended him to the university. At Cambridge, Newton started as a subsizar, paying his way by performing valet duties until he was awarded a scholarship in 1664, which covered his university costs for four more years until the completion of his MA. At the time, Cambridge&#x27;s teachings were based on those of Aristotle, whom Newton read along with then more modern philosophers, including Descartes and astronomers such as Galileo Galilei and Thomas Street. He set down in his notebook a series of &quot;&quot;Quaestiones&quot;&quot; about mechanical philosophy as he found it. In 1665, he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became calculus. Soon after Newton obtained his BA degree at Cambridge in August 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the Great Plague.

Although he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student, his private studies and the years following his bachelor&#x27;s degree have been described as &quot;the richest and most productive ever experienced by a scientist&quot;. The next two years alone saw the development of theories on calculus, optics, and the law of gravitation, at his home in Woolsthorpe. The physicist Louis T. More stated that &quot;There are no other examples of achievement in the history of science to compare with that of Newton during those two golden years.&quot;

Newton has been described as an &quot;exceptionally organized&quot; person when it came to note-taking, further dog-earing pages he saw as important. Furthermore, Newton&#x27;s &quot;indexes look like present-day indexes: They are alphabetical, by topic.&quot; His books showed his interests to be wide-ranging, with Newton himself described as a &quot;Janusian thinker, someone who could mix and combine seemingly disparate fields to stimulate creative breakthroughs.&quot;

In April 1667, Newton returned to the University of Cambridge, and in October he was elected as a fellow of Trinity. Fellows were required to take holy orders and be ordained as Anglican priests, although this was not enforced in the Restoration years, and an assertion of conformity to the Church of England was sufficient. He made the commitment that &quot;I will either set Theology as the object of my studies and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes [7 years] arrives, or I will resign from the college.&quot; Up until this point he had not thought much about religion and had twice signed his agreement to the Thirty-nine Articles, the basis of Church of England doctrine. By 1675 the issue could not be avoided, and by then his unconventional views stood in the way.

His academic work impressed the Lucasian Professor Isaac Barrow, who was anxious to develop his own religious and administrative potential (he became master of Trinity College two years later); in 1669, Newton succeeded him, only one year after receiving his MA. Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and King Charles II, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument; thus, a conflict between Newton&#x27;s religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted. He was appointed at the age of 26.
The Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge position included the responsibility of instructing geography. In 1672, and again in 1681, Newton published a revised, corrected, and amended edition of the &quot;Geographia Generalis&quot;, a geography textbook first published in 1650 by the then-deceased Bernhardus Varenius. In the &quot;Geographia Generalis,&quot; Varenius attempted to create a theoretical foundation linking scientific principles to classical concepts in geography, and considered geography to be a mix between science and pure mathematics applied to quantifying features of the Earth. While it is unclear if Newton ever lectured in geography, the 1733 Dugdale and Shaw English translation of the book stated Newton published the book to be read by students while he lectured on the subject. The &quot;Geographia Generalis&quot; is viewed by some as the dividing line between ancient and modern traditions in the history of geography, and Newton&#x27;s involvement in the subsequent editions is thought to be a large part of the reason for this enduring legacy.

Newton was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1672.

== Mid-life ==
=== Calculus ===
Newton&#x27;s work has been said &quot;to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied&quot;. His work on calculus, usually referred to as fluxions, began in 1664, and by May 20, 1665 as seen in a manuscript, Newton &quot;had already developed the calculus to the point where he could compute the tangent and the curvature at any point of a continuous curve&quot;. Another manuscript of October 1666, is now published among Newton&#x27;s mathematical papers. His work &quot;De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas&quot;, sent by Isaac Barrow to John Collins in June 1669, was identified by Barrow in a letter sent to Collins that August as the work &quot;of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things&quot;. Newton later became involved in a dispute with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz over priority in the development of calculus. Both are now credited with independently developing calculus, though with very different mathematical notations. However, it is established that Newton came to develop calculus much earlier than Leibniz. Leibniz&#x27;s notation is recognized as the more convenient notation, being adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820, by British mathematicians.

Historian of science A. Rupert Hall notes that while Leibniz deserves credit for his independent formulation of calculus, Newton was undoubtedly the first to develop it, stating:Hall further notes that in &quot;Principia&quot;, Newton was able to &quot;formulate and resolve problems by the integration of differential equations&quot; and &quot;in fact, he anticipated in his book many results that later exponents of the calculus regarded as their own novel achievements.&quot;

It has been noted that despite the convenience of Leibniz&#x27;s notation, Newton&#x27;s notation could still have been used to develop multivariate techniques, with his dot notation still widely used in physics. Some academics have noted the richness and depth of Newton&#x27;s work, such as physicist Roger Penrose, stating &quot;in most cases Newton’s geometrical methods are not only more concise and elegant, they reveal deeper principles than would become evident by the use of those formal methods of calculus that nowadays would seem more direct.&quot; Mathematician Vladimir Arnold states &quot;Comparing the texts of Newton with the comments of his successors, it is striking how Newton’s original presentation is more modern, more understandable and richer in ideas than the translation due to commentators of his geometrical ideas into the formal language of the calculus of Leibniz.&quot;

His work extensively uses calculus in geometric form based on limiting values of the ratios of vanishingly small quantities: in the &quot;Principia&quot; itself, Newton gave demonstration of this under the name of &quot;the method of first and last ratios&quot; and explained why he put his expositions in this form, remarking also that &quot;hereby the same thing is performed as by the method of indivisibles.&quot; Because of this, the &quot;Principia&quot; has been called &quot;a book dense with the theory and application of the infinitesimal calculus&quot; in modern times and in Newton&#x27;s time &quot;nearly all of it is of this calculus.&quot; His use of methods involving &quot;one or more orders of the infinitesimally small&quot; is present in his &quot;De motu corporum in gyrum&quot; of 1684 and in his papers on motion &quot;during the two decades preceding 1684&quot;.

Newton had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared controversy and criticism. He was close to the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier. In 1691, Duillier started to write a new version of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot;, and corresponded with Leibniz. In 1693, the relationship between Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was never completed. Starting in 1699, Duillier accused Leibniz of plagiarism. Mathematician John Keill accused Leibniz of plagiarism in 1708 in the Royal Society journal, thereby deteriorating the situation even more. The dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labelled Leibniz a fraud; it was later found that Newton wrote the study&#x27;s concluding remarks on Leibniz. Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both men until Leibniz&#x27;s death in 1716.

Newton is credited with the generalised binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. He discovered Newton&#x27;s identities, Newton&#x27;s method, classified cubic plane curves (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made substantial contributions to the theory of finite differences, with Newton regarded as &quot;the single most significant contributor to finite difference interpolation&quot;, with many formulas created by Newton. He was the first to state Bézout&#x27;s theorem, and was also the first to use fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations. He approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms (a precursor to Euler&#x27;s summation formula) and was the first to use power series with confidence and to revert power series. He originated the Newton-Cotes formulas for numerical integration. His work on infinite series was inspired by Simon Stevin&#x27;s decimals. He also initiated the field of calculus of variations, being the first to clearly formulate and correctly solve a problem in the field, that being Newton&#x27;s minimal resistance problem, which he posed and solved in 1685, and then later published in &quot;Principia&quot; in 1687. It is regarded as one of the most difficult problems tackled by variational methods prior to the twentieth century. He then used calculus of variations in his solving of the brachistochrone curve problem in 1697, which was posed by Johann Bernoulli in 1696, thus he pioneered the field with his work on the two problems.

=== Optics ===
In 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism in the position of minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles. This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light – a point which had, until then, been a matter of debate.

From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During this period he investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured image produced by a prism, which he named a spectrum, could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton&#x27;s analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.

In his work on Newton&#x27;s rings in 1671, he used a method that was unprecedented in the 17th century, as &quot;he &quot;averaged&quot; all of the differences, and he then calculated the difference between the average and the value for the first ring&quot;, in effect introducing a now standard method for reducing noise in measurements, and which does not appear elsewhere at the time. He extended his &quot;error-slaying method&quot; to studies of equinoxes in 1700, which was described as an &quot;altogether unprecedented method&quot; but differed in that here &quot;Newton required good values for each of the original equinoctial times, and so he devised a method that allowed them to, as it were, self-correct.&quot; Newton wrote down the first of the two &#x27;normal equations&#x27; known from ordinary least squares and introduced &quot;an embryonic linear regression analysis&quot;, as he averaged a set of data, 50 years before Tobias Mayer and also &quot;summing the residuals to zero he &quot;forced&quot; the regression line to pass through the average point&quot;. He also &quot;distinguished between two inhomogeneous sets of data and might have thought of an &quot;optimal&quot; solution in terms of bias, though not in terms of effectiveness&quot;.

He showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton&#x27;s theory of colour.

From this work, he concluded that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. He grounded his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton&#x27;s rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes. In late 1668, he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, he was asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope by the Royal Society. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, &quot;Of Colours&quot;, which he later expanded into the work &quot;Opticks&quot;. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton&#x27;s ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. However, the two had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, who had been appointed Secretary of the Royal Society, opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. The two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke&#x27;s death.

Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium. He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films (&quot;Opticks&quot; Bk. II, Props. 12), but still retained his theory of &#x27;fits&#x27; that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted (Props.13). Physicists later favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for the interference patterns and the general phenomenon of diffraction. Despite his known preference of a particle theory, Newton in fact noted that light had both particle-like and wave-like properties in &quot;Opticks&quot;, and was the first to attempt to reconcile the two theories, thereby anticipating later developments of wave-particle duality, which is the modern understanding of light.

In his &quot;Hypothesis of Light&quot; of 1675, Newton posited the existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles. The contact with the Cambridge Platonist philosopher Henry More revived his interest in alchemy. He replaced the ether with occult forces based on Hermetic ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles. His contributions to science cannot be isolated from his interest in alchemy. This was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science.

In 1704, Newton published &quot;Opticks&quot;, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light, and included a set of queries at the end, which were posed as unanswered questions and positive assertions. In line with his corpuscle theory, he thought that normal matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation, with query 30 stating &quot;Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?&quot; Query 6 introduced the concept of a black body. 

Newton investigated electricity by constructing a primitive form of a frictional electrostatic generator using a glass globe, and detailed an experiment in 1675 that showed when one side of a glass sheet is rubbed to create an electric charge, it attracts &quot;light bodies&quot; to the opposite side. He interpreted this as evidence that electric forces could pass through glass. His idea in &quot;Opticks&quot; that optical reflection and refraction arise from interactions across the entire surface is regarded as the beginning of the field theory of electric force. His mass-dispersion model, ancestral to the successful use of the least action principle, provided a credible framework for understanding refraction, particularly in its approach to refraction in terms of momentum.

In &quot;Opticks&quot;, he was the first to show a diagram using a prism as a beam expander, and also the use of multiple-prism arrays. Some 278 years after Newton&#x27;s discussion, multiple-prism beam expanders became central to the development of narrow-linewidth tunable lasers. The use of these prismatic beam expanders led to the multiple-prism dispersion theory.

Subsequent to Newton, much has been amended. Thomas Young and Augustin-Jean Fresnel discarded Newton&#x27;s particle theory in favour of Christiaan Huygens&#x27; wave theory to show that colour is the visible manifestation of light&#x27;s wavelength. Science also slowly came to realise the difference between perception of colour and mathematisable optics. The German poet and scientist, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, could not shake the Newtonian foundation but &quot;one hole Goethe did find in Newton&#x27;s armour, ... Newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible. He, therefore, thought that the object-glasses of telescopes must forever remain imperfect, achromatism and refraction being incompatible. This inference was proved by Dollond to be wrong.&quot;
=== Gravity ===
Newton had been developing his theory of gravitation as far back as 1665. In 1679, he returned to his work on celestial mechanics by considering gravitation and its effect on the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion. Newton&#x27;s reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed. After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. He communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in , a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society&#x27;s Register Book in December 1684. This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the &quot;Principia&quot;.

The was published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Halley. In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion. Together, these laws describe the relationship between any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for classical mechanics. They contributed to many advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advances continue to be the underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. He used the Latin word &quot;gravitas&quot; (weight) for the effect that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation. His work achieved the first great unification in physics. He further solved the two-body problem, and introduced the three-body problem.

In the same work, Newton presented a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using &#x27;first and last ratios&#x27;, gave the first analytical determination (based on Boyle&#x27;s law) of the speed of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth&#x27;s spheroidal figure, accounted for the precession of the equinoxes as a result of the Moon&#x27;s gravitational attraction on the Earth&#x27;s oblateness, initiated the gravitational study of the irregularities in the motion of the Moon, provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more. Newton&#x27;s biographer David Brewster reported that the complexity of applying his theory of gravity to the motion of the moon was so great it affected Newton&#x27;s health: &quot;[H]e was deprived of his appetite and sleep&quot; during his work on the problem in 1692–93, and told the astronomer John Machin that &quot;his head never ached but when he was studying the subject&quot;. According to Brewster, Halley also told John Conduitt that when pressed to complete his analysis Newton &quot;always replied that it made his head ache, and &quot;kept him awake so often, that he would think of it no more&quot;&quot;. [Emphasis in original]

Newton made clear his heliocentric view of the Solar System—developed in a somewhat modern way because already in the mid-1680s he recognised the &quot;deviation of the Sun&quot; from the centre of gravity of the Solar System. For Newton, it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but rather &quot;the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem&#x27;d the Centre of the World&quot;, and this centre of gravity &quot;either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line&quot;. (Newton adopted the &quot;at rest&quot; alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest.)

Newton was criticised for introducing &quot;occult agencies&quot; into science because of his postulate of an invisible force able to act over vast distances. Later, in the second edition of the &quot;Principia&quot; (1713), Newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding General Scholium, writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction, as they did; but they did not so far indicate its cause, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomena. (Here he used what became his famous expression .)

With the , Newton became internationally recognised. He acquired a circle of admirers, including the Swiss-born mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier.

In the 1660s and 1670s, Newton found 72 of the 78 &quot;species&quot; of cubic curves and categorised them into four types, systemizing his results in later publications. However, a 1690s manuscript later analyzed showed that Newton had identified all 78 cubic curves, but chose not to publish the remaining six for unknown reasons. In 1717, and probably with Newton&#x27;s help, James Stirling proved that every cubic was one of these four types. He claimed that the four types could be obtained by plane projection from one of them, and this was proved in 1731, four years after his death.

=== Other significant work ===
Newton studied heat and energy flow, formulating an empirical law of cooling which states that the rate at which an object cools is proportional to the temperature difference between the object and its surrounding environment. It was first formulated in 1701, and is the first heat transfer formulation and serves as the formal basis of convective heat transfer.

Newton introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid with his formulation of his law of viscosity in &quot;Principia&quot; in 1687. It states that the shear stress between two fluid layers is directly proportional to the velocity gradient between them.

=== Philosophy of Science ===

Starting with the second edition of his &quot;Principia&quot;, Newton included a final section on science philosophy or method. It was here that he wrote his famous line, in Latin, &quot;hypotheses non fingo&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;I don&#x27;t make hypotheses,&quot; (the direct translation of &quot;fingo&quot; is &quot;frame&quot;, but in context he was advocating against the use of hypotheses in science). He went on to posit that if there is no data to explain a finding, one should simply wait for that data, rather than guessing at an explanation. The quote in part as translated is, &quot;Hitherto I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phenomena, and I frame no hypotheses, for whatever is not deduced from the phenomena is to be called an hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction&quot;.

Newton contributed to and refined the scientific method. In his work on the properties of light in the 1670s, he showed his rigorous method, which was conducting experiments, taking detailed notes, making measurements, conducting more experiments that grew out of the initial ones, he formulated a theory, created more experiments to test it, and finally described the entire process so other scientists could replicate every step.

In his 1687 &quot;Principia&quot;, he outlined four rules: the first is, &#x27;Admit no more causes of natural things than are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances&#x27;; the second is, &#x27;To the same natural effect, assign the same causes&#x27;; the third is, &#x27;Qualities of bodies, which are found to belong to all bodies within experiments, are to be esteemed universal&#x27;; and lastly, &#x27;Propositions collected from observation of phenomena should be viewed as accurate or very nearly true until contradicted by other phenomena&#x27;. These rules have become the basis of the modern approaches to science.

== Later life ==
=== Royal Mint ===

In the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible. A manuscript Newton sent to John Locke in which he disputed the fidelity of 1 John 5:7—the Johannine Comma—and its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New Testament, remained unpublished until 1785.

Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England for Cambridge University in 1689 and 1701, but according to some accounts his only comments were to complain about a cold draught in the chamber and request that the window be closed. He was, however, noted by Cambridge diarist Abraham de la Pryme to have rebuked students who were frightening locals by claiming that a house was haunted.

Newton moved to London to take up the post of warden of the Royal Mint during the reign of King William III in 1696, a position that he had obtained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. He took charge of England&#x27;s great recoining, trod on the toes of Lord Lucas, Governor of the Tower, and secured the job of deputy comptroller of the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley. Newton became perhaps the best-known Master of the Mint upon the death of Thomas Neale in 1699, a position he held for the last 30 years of his life. These appointments were intended as sinecures, but Newton took them seriously. He retired from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercised his authority to reform the currency and punish clippers and counterfeiters.

As Warden, and afterwards as Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20 percent of the coins taken in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit. Counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by the felon being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult, but Newton proved equal to the task.

Disguised as a habitué of bars and taverns, he gathered much of that evidence himself. For all the barriers placed to prosecution, and separating the branches of government, English law still had ancient and formidable customs of authority. Newton had himself made a justice of the peace in all the home counties. A draft letter regarding the matter is included in Newton&#x27;s personal first edition of &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;, which he must have been amending at the time. Then he conducted more than 100 cross-examinations of witnesses, informers, and suspects between June 1698 and Christmas 1699. He successfully prosecuted 28 coiners, including serial counterfeiter William Chaloner, who was subsequently hanged.

Beyond prosecuting counterfeiters, he improved minting technology and reduced the standard deviation of the weight of guineas from 1.3 grams to 0.75 grams. Starting in 1707, Newton introduced the practice of testing a small sample of coins, a pound in weight, in the trial of the pyx, which helped to reduce the size of admissible error. He ultimately saved the Treasury a then £41,510, roughly £3 million in 2012, with his improvements lasting until the 1770s, thereby increasing the accuracy of British coinage.

Newton was made president of the Royal Society in 1703 and an associate of the French Académie des Sciences. In his position at the Royal Society, Newton made an enemy of John Flamsteed, the Astronomer Royal, by prematurely publishing Flamsteed&#x27;s &quot;Historia Coelestis Britannica&quot;, which Newton had used in his studies.

=== Knighthood ===
In April 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton during a royal visit to Trinity College, Cambridge. The knighthood is likely to have been motivated by political considerations connected with the parliamentary election in May 1705, rather than any recognition of Newton&#x27;s scientific work or services as Master of the Mint. Newton was the second scientist to be knighted, after Francis Bacon.

As a result of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&#x27;s Treasury, the bimetallic relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings. This inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard. It is a matter of debate as to whether he intended to do this or not. It has been argued that Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.

Newton was invested in the South Sea Company and lost some £20,000 (£4.4 million in 2020) when it collapsed in around 1720.

Toward the end of his life, Newton took up residence at Cranbury Park, near Winchester, with his niece and her husband, until his death. His half-niece, Catherine Barton, served as his hostess in social affairs at his house on Jermyn Street in London; he was her &quot;very loving Uncle&quot;, according to his letter to her when she was recovering from smallpox.

=== Death ===

Newton died in his sleep in London on 20 March 1727 (OS 20 March 1726; NS 31 March 1727). He was given a ceremonial funeral, attended by nobles, scientists, and philosophers, and was buried in Westminster Abbey among kings and queens. He was the first scientist to be buried in the abbey. Voltaire may have been present at his funeral. A bachelor, he had divested much of his estate to relatives during his last years, and died intestate. His papers went to John Conduitt and Catherine Barton.

Shortly after his death, a plaster death mask was moulded of Newton. It was used by Flemish sculptor John Michael Rysbrack in making a sculpture of Newton. It is now held by the Royal Society, who created a 3D scan of it in 2012.

Newton&#x27;s hair was posthumously examined and found to contain mercury, probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits. Mercury poisoning could explain Newton&#x27;s eccentricity in late life.

== Personality ==
Although it was claimed that he was once engaged, Newton never married. The French writer and philosopher Voltaire, who was in London at the time of Newton&#x27;s funeral, said that he &quot;was never sensible to any passion, was not subject to the common frailties of mankind, nor had any commerce with women—a circumstance which was assured me by the physician and surgeon who attended him in his last moments.” There exists a widespread belief that Newton died a virgin, and writers as diverse as mathematician Charles Hutton, economist John Maynard Keynes, and physicist Carl Sagan have commented on it.

Newton had a close friendship with the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, whom he met in London around 1689; some of their correspondence has survived. Their relationship came to an abrupt and unexplained end in 1693, and at the same time Newton suffered a nervous breakdown, which included sending wild accusatory letters to his friends Samuel Pepys and John Locke. His note to the latter included the charge that Locke had endeavoured to &quot;embroil&quot; him with &quot;woemen &amp; by other means&quot;.

Newton appeared to be relatively modest about his achievements, writing in a later memoir, &quot;I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.&quot; Nonetheless, he could be fiercely competitive and did on occasion hold grudges against his intellectual rivals, not abstaining from personal attacks when it suited him—a common trait found in many of his contemporaries. In a letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676, for instance, he confessed &quot;If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.&quot; Some historians argued that this, written at a time when Newton and Hooke were disputing over optical discoveries, was an oblique attack on Hooke who was presumably short and hunchbacked, rather than (or in addition to) a statement of modesty. On the other hand, the widely known proverb about standing on the shoulders of giants, found in 17th century poet George Herbert&#x27;s (1651) among others, had as its main point that &quot;a dwarf on a giant&#x27;s shoulders sees farther of the two&quot;, and so in effect place Newton himself rather than Hooke as the &#x27;dwarf&#x27; who saw farther.
== Theology ==
=== Religious views ===

Although born into an Anglican family, by his thirties Newton held a Christian faith that, had it been made public, would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream Christianity, with historian Stephen Snobelen labelling him a heretic.

By 1672, he had started to record his theological researches in notebooks which he showed to no one and which have only been available for public examination since 1972. Over half of what Newton wrote concerned theology and alchemy, and most has never been printed. His writings demonstrate an extensive knowledge of early Church writings and show that in the conflict between Athanasius and Arius which defined the Creed, he took the side of Arius, the loser, who rejected the conventional view of the Trinity. Newton &quot;recognized Christ as a divine mediator between God and man, who was subordinate to the Father who created him.&quot; He was especially interested in prophecy, but for him, &quot;the great apostasy was trinitarianism.&quot;

Newton tried unsuccessfully to obtain one of the two fellowships that exempted the holder from the ordination requirement. At the last moment in 1675 he received a dispensation from the government that excused him and all future holders of the Lucasian chair.

Worshipping Jesus Christ as God was, in Newton&#x27;s eyes, idolatry, an act he believed to be the fundamental sin. In 1999, Snobelen wrote, that&quot;Isaac Newton was a heretic. But ... he never made a public declaration of his private faith—which the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical. He hid his faith so well that scholars are still unraveling his personal beliefs.&quot; Snobelen concludes that Newton was at least a Socinian sympathiser (he owned and had thoroughly read at least eight Socinian books), possibly an Arian and almost certainly an anti-trinitarian.

Although the laws of motion and universal gravitation became Newton&#x27;s best-known discoveries, he warned against using them to view the Universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a great clock. He said, &quot;So then gravity may put the planets into motion, but without the Divine Power it could never put them into such a circulating motion, as they have about the sun&quot;.

Along with his scientific fame, Newton&#x27;s studies of the Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably &quot;An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture&quot; and &quot;&quot;. He placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.

He believed in a rationally immanent world, but he rejected the hylozoism implicit in Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Baruch Spinoza. The ordered and dynamically informed Universe could be understood, and must be understood, by an active reason. In his correspondence, he claimed that in writing the &quot;Principia&quot; &quot;I had an eye upon such Principles as might work with considering men for the belief of a Deity&quot;. He saw evidence of design in the system of the world: &quot;Such a wonderful uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed the effect of choice&quot;. But Newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be required to reform the system, due to the slow growth of instabilities. For this, Leibniz lampooned him: &quot;God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time: otherwise it would cease to move. He had not, it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion.&quot;

Newton&#x27;s position was defended by his follower Samuel Clarke in a famous correspondence. A century later, Pierre-Simon Laplace&#x27;s work &quot;Celestial Mechanics&quot; had a natural explanation for why the planet orbits do not require periodic divine intervention. The contrast between Laplace&#x27;s mechanistic worldview and Newton&#x27;s one is the most strident considering the famous answer which the French scientist gave Napoleon, who had criticised him for the absence of the Creator in the &quot;Mécanique céleste&quot;: &quot;Sire, j&#x27;ai pu me passer de cette hypothèse&quot; (&quot;Sir, I didn&#x27;t need this hypothesis&quot;).

Scholars long debated whether Newton disputed the doctrine of the Trinity. His first biographer, David Brewster, who compiled his manuscripts, interpreted Newton as questioning the veracity of some passages used to support the Trinity, but never denying the doctrine of the Trinity as such. In the twentieth century, encrypted manuscripts written by Newton and bought by John Maynard Keynes (among others) were deciphered and it became known that Newton did indeed reject Trinitarianism.

=== Religious thought ===

Newton and Robert Boyle&#x27;s approach to the mechanical philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as a viable alternative to the pantheists and enthusiasts, and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the latitudinarians. The clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and metaphysical superlatives of both superstitious enthusiasm and the threat of atheism, and at the same time, the second wave of English deists used Newton&#x27;s discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a &quot;Natural Religion&quot;.

The attacks made against pre-Enlightenment &quot;magical thinking&quot;, and the mystical elements of Christianity, were given their foundation with Boyle&#x27;s mechanical conception of the universe. Newton gave Boyle&#x27;s ideas their completion through mathematical proofs and, perhaps more importantly, was very successful in popularising them.

== Alchemy ==
Of an estimated ten million words of writing in Newton&#x27;s papers, about one million deal with alchemy. Many of Newton&#x27;s writings on alchemy are copies of other manuscripts, with his own annotations. Alchemical texts mix artisanal knowledge with philosophical speculation, often hidden behind layers of wordplay, allegory, and imagery to protect craft secrets. Some of the content contained in Newton&#x27;s papers could have been considered heretical by the church.

In 1888, after spending sixteen years cataloguing Newton&#x27;s papers, Cambridge University kept a small number and returned the rest to the Earl of Portsmouth. In 1936, a descendant offered the papers for sale at Sotheby&#x27;s. The collection was broken up and sold for a total of about £9,000. John Maynard Keynes was one of about three dozen bidders who obtained part of the collection at auction. Keynes went on to reassemble an estimated half of Newton&#x27;s collection of papers on alchemy before donating his collection to Cambridge University in 1946.

All of Newton&#x27;s known writings on alchemy are currently being put online in a project undertaken by Indiana University: &quot;The Chymistry of Isaac Newton&quot; and has been summarised in a book.

In June 2020, two unpublished pages of Newton&#x27;s notes on Jan Baptist van Helmont&#x27;s book on plague, &quot;De Peste&quot;, were being auctioned online by Bonhams. Newton&#x27;s analysis of this book, which he made in Cambridge while protecting himself from London&#x27;s 1665–1666 infection, is the most substantial written statement he is known to have made about the plague, according to Bonhams. As far as the therapy is concerned, Newton writes that &quot;the best is a toad suspended by the legs in a chimney for three days, which at last vomited up earth with various insects in it, on to a dish of yellow wax, and shortly after died. Combining powdered toad with the excretions and serum made into lozenges and worn about the affected area drove away the contagion and drew out the poison&quot;.

== Legacy ==
=== Recognition ===
The mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange frequently asserted that Newton was the greatest genius who ever lived, and once added that Newton was also &quot;the most fortunate, for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish.&quot; English poet Alexander Pope wrote the famous epitaph:

But this was not allowed to be inscribed in Newton&#x27;s monument at Westminster. The epitaph added is as follows:

which can be translated as follows:

Newton has been called &quot;the most influential figure in the history of Western science&quot;, and has been regarded as &quot;the central figure in the history of science&quot;, who &quot;more than anyone else is the source of our great confidence in the power of science.&quot; &quot;New Scientist&quot; called Newton &quot;the supreme genius and most enigmatic character in the history of science&quot;. The philosopher and historian David Hume also declared that Newton was &quot;the greatest and rarest genius that ever arose for the ornament and instruction of the species&quot;. In his home of Monticello, Thomas Jefferson, a Founding Father and President of the United States, kept portraits of John Locke, Sir Francis Bacon, and Newton, whom he described as &quot;the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception&quot;, and who he credited with laying &quot;the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical and Moral sciences&quot;.

Newton has further been called &quot;the towering figure of the Scientific Revolution&quot; and that &quot;In a period rich with outstanding thinkers, Newton was simply the most outstanding.&quot; The polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe labeled Newton&#x27;s birth as the &quot;Christmas of the modern age&quot;. In the Italian polymath Vilfredo Pareto&#x27;s estimation, Newton was the greatest human being who ever lived. On the bicentennial of Newton&#x27;s death in 1927, astronomer James Jeans stated that he &quot;was certainly the greatest man of science, and perhaps the greatest intellect, the human race has seen&quot;. Newton ultimately conceived four revolutions—in optics, mathematics, mechanics, and gravity—but also foresaw a fifth in electricity, though he lacked the time and energy in old age to fully accomplish it.

The physicist Ludwig Boltzmann called Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; &quot;the first and greatest work ever written about theoretical physics&quot;. Physicist Stephen Hawking similarly called &quot;Principia&quot; &quot;probably the most important single work ever published in the physical sciences&quot;. Lagrange called &quot;Principia&quot; &quot;the greatest production of the human mind&quot;, and noted that &quot;he felt dazed at such an illustration of what man&#x27;s intellect might be capable&quot;.

Physicist Edward Andrade stated that Newton &quot;was capable of greater sustained mental effort than any man, before or since&quot;, and noted earlier the place of Isaac Newton in history, stating:The French physicist and mathematician Jean-Baptiste Biot praised Newton&#x27;s genius, stating that:
Despite his rivalry with Gottfried Wilhem Leibniz, Leibniz still praised the work of Newton, with him responding to a question at a dinner in 1701 from Sophia Charlotte, the Queen of Prussia, about his view of Newton with:
Mathematician E.T. Bell ranked Newton alongside Carl Friedrich Gauss and Archimedes as the three greatest mathematicians of all time. In &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Isaac Newton&quot; (2016), he is described as being &quot;from a very young age, an extraordinary problem-solver, as good, it would appear, as humanity has ever produced&quot;. He is ultimately ranked among the top two or three greatest theoretical scientists ever, alongside James Clerk Maxwell and Albert Einstein, the greatest mathematician ever alongside Carl F. Gauss, and among the best experimentalists ever, thereby &quot;putting Newton in a class by himself among empirical scientists, for one has trouble in thinking of any other candidate who was in the first rank of even two of these categories.&quot; Also noted is &quot;At least in comparison to subsequent scientists, Newton was also exceptional in his ability to put his scientific effort in much wider perspective&quot;. Gauss himself had Archimedes and Newton as his heroes, and used terms such as or to describe other intellectuals such as great mathematicians and philosophers, but reserved for Newton only, and once remarked that &quot;Newton remains forever the master of all masters!&quot; 

Albert Einstein kept a picture of Newton on his study wall alongside ones of Michael Faraday and of James Clerk Maxwell. Einstein stated that Newton&#x27;s creation of calculus in relation to his laws of motion was &quot;perhaps the greatest advance in thought that a single individual was ever privileged to make.&quot; He also noted the influence of Newton, stating that:In 1999, an opinion poll of 100 of the day&#x27;s leading physicists voted Einstein the &quot;greatest physicist ever,&quot; with Newton the runner-up, while a parallel survey of rank-and-file physicists ranked Newton as the greatest. In 2005, a dual survey of both the public and of members of Britain&#x27;s Royal Society (formerly headed by Newton) asking who had the greater effect on both the history of science and on the history of mankind, Newton or Einstein, both the public and the Royal Society deemed Newton to have made the greater overall contributions for both.

In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; named Newton the Person of the Century for the 17th century. Newton placed sixth in the &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot; poll conducted by BBC in 2002. However, in 2003, he was voted as the greatest Briton in a poll conducted by BBC World, with Winston Churchill second. He was voted as the greatest Cantabrigian by University of Cambridge students in 2009.

Physicist Lev Landau ranked physicists on a logarithmic scale of productivity and genius ranging from 0 to 5. The highest ranking, 0, was assigned to Newton. Einstein was ranked 0.5. A rank of 1 was awarded to the fathers of quantum mechanics, such as Werner Heisenberg and Paul Dirac. Landau, a Nobel prize winner and the discoverer of superfluidity, ranked himself as 2.

The SI derived unit of force is named the Newton in his honour.

=== Apple incident ===
Newton himself often told the story that he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravitation by watching the fall of an apple from a tree. The story is believed to have passed into popular knowledge after being related by Catherine Barton, Newton&#x27;s niece, to Voltaire. Voltaire then wrote in his &quot;Essay on Epic Poetry&quot; (1727), &quot;Sir Isaac Newton walking in his gardens, had the first thought of his system of gravitation, upon seeing an apple falling from a tree.&quot;

Although it has been said that the apple story is a myth and that he did not arrive at his theory of gravity at any single moment, acquaintances of Newton (such as William Stukeley, whose manuscript account of 1752 has been made available by the Royal Society) do in fact confirm the incident, though not the apocryphal version that the apple actually hit Newton&#x27;s head. Stukeley recorded in his &quot;Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s Life&quot; a conversation with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726:

John Conduitt, Newton&#x27;s assistant at the Royal Mint and husband of Newton&#x27;s niece, also described the event when he wrote about Newton&#x27;s life:
It is known from his notebooks that Newton was grappling in the late 1660s with the idea that terrestrial gravity extends, in an inverse-square proportion, to the Moon; however, it took him two decades to develop the full-fledged theory. The question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the Moon to its orbit. Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon&#x27;s orbital period, and get good agreement. He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it &quot;universal gravitation&quot;.

Various trees are claimed to be &quot;the&quot; apple tree which Newton describes. The King&#x27;s School, Grantham claims that the tree was purchased by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster&#x27;s garden some years later. The staff of the (now) National Trust-owned Woolsthorpe Manor dispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton. A descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room Newton lived in when he studied there. The National Fruit Collection at Brogdale in Kent can supply grafts from their tree, which appears identical to Flower of Kent, a coarse-fleshed cooking variety.

=== Commemorations ===

Newton&#x27;s monument (1731) can be seen in Westminster Abbey, at the north of the entrance to the choir against the choir screen, near his tomb. It was executed by the sculptor Michael Rysbrack (1694–1770) in white and grey marble with design by the architect William Kent. The monument features a figure of Newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus, his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design. Above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the signs of the Zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680. A relief panel depicts putti using instruments such as a telescope and prism.

From 1978 until 1988, an image of Newton designed by Harry Ecclestone appeared on Series D £1 banknotes issued by the Bank of England (the last £1 notes to be issued by the Bank of England). Newton was shown on the reverse of the notes holding a book and accompanied by a telescope, a prism and a map of the Solar System.

A statue of Isaac Newton, looking at an apple at his feet, can be seen at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. A large bronze statue, &quot;Newton, after William Blake&quot;, by Eduardo Paolozzi, dated 1995 and inspired by Blake&#x27;s etching, dominates the piazza of the British Library in London. A bronze statue of Newton was erected in 1858 in the centre of Grantham where he went to school, prominently standing in front of Grantham Guildhall.

The still-surviving farmhouse at Woolsthorpe By Colsterworth is a Grade I listed building by Historic England through being his birthplace and &quot;where he discovered gravity and developed his theories regarding the refraction of light&quot;.
== The Enlightenment ==
Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors—Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally—as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of nature and natural law to every physical and social field of the day. In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded.

It is held by European philosophers of the Enlightenment and by historians of the Enlightenment that Newton&#x27;s publication of the &quot;Principia&quot; was a turning point in the Scientific Revolution and started the Enlightenment. It was Newton&#x27;s conception of the universe based upon natural and rationally understandable laws that became one of the seeds for Enlightenment ideology. Locke and Voltaire applied concepts of natural law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the physiocrats and Adam Smith applied natural conceptions of psychology and self-interest to economic systems; and sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit history into natural models of progress. Monboddo and Samuel Clarke resisted elements of Newton&#x27;s work, but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.

<doc id="14631" wikidata="Q9312" url="?curid=14631" title="Immanuel Kant">
<text>Immanuel Kant (born Emanuel Kant; 22 April 1724 – 12 February 1804) was a German philosopher and one of the central Enlightenment thinkers. Born in Königsberg, Kant&#x27;s comprehensive and systematic works in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics have made him one of the most influential and controversial figures in modern Western philosophy. He has been called the &quot;father of modern ethics&quot;, the &quot;father of modern aesthetics&quot;, and for bringing together rationalism and empiricism, the &quot;father of modern philosophy&quot;.

In his doctrine of transcendental idealism, Kant argued that space and time are mere &quot;forms of intuition&quot; that structure all experience, and that the objects of experience are mere &quot;appearances&quot;. The nature of things as they are in themselves is unknowable to us. Nonetheless, in an attempt to counter the philosophical doctrine of skepticism, he wrote the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; (1781/1787), his best-known work. Kant drew a parallel to the Copernican Revolution in his proposal to think of the objects of experience as conforming to our spatial and temporal forms of intuition and the categories of our understanding, so that we have &quot;a priori&quot; cognition of those objects. These claims have proved especially influential in the social sciences, particularly sociology and anthropology, which regard human activities as pre-oriented by cultural norms.

Kant believed that reason is the source of morality, and that aesthetics arises from a faculty of disinterested judgment. Kant&#x27;s religious views were deeply connected to his moral theory. Their exact nature remains in dispute. He hoped that perpetual peace could be secured through an international federation of republican states and international cooperation. His cosmopolitan reputation is called into question by his promulgation of scientific racism for much of his career, although he altered his views on the subject in the last decade of his life.

==Biography==
Immanuel Kant was born on 22 April 1724 into a Prussian German family of Lutheran faith in Königsberg, East Prussia. His mother, Anna Regina Reuter (1697–1737), was born in Königsberg to a father from Nuremberg. Her surname is sometimes erroneously given as Porter. Kant&#x27;s father, Johann Georg Kant (1682–1746), was a German harness-maker from Memel, at the time Prussia&#x27;s most northeastern city (now Klaipėda, Lithuania). It is possible that the Kants got their name from the village of Kantvainiai (German: &quot;Kantwaggen&quot; – today part of Priekulė) and were of Kursenieki origin.

Kant was baptized as Emanuel and later changed the spelling of his name to Immanuel after learning Hebrew. He was the fourth of nine children (six of whom reached adulthood). The Kant household stressed the pietist values of religious devotion, humility, and a literal interpretation of the Bible. The young Immanuel&#x27;s education was strict, punitive and disciplinary, and focused on Latin and religious instruction over mathematics and science. In his later years, Kant lived a strictly ordered life. It was said that neighbors would set their clocks by his daily walks. Kant considered marriage two times, first a widow and then a Westphalian girl, but both times waited too long. Though he never married he seems to have had a rewarding social life; he was a popular teacher as well as a modestly successful author, even before starting on his major philosophical works.

===Young scholar===
Kant showed a great aptitude for study at an early age. He first attended the Collegium Fridericianum, from which he graduated at the end of the summer of 1740. In 1740, aged 16, he enrolled at the University of Königsberg, where he would later remain for the rest of his professional life. He studied the philosophy of Gottfried Leibniz and Christian Wolff under Martin Knutzen (Associate Professor of Logic and Metaphysics from 1734 until he died in 1751), a rationalist who was also familiar with developments in British philosophy and science and introduced Kant to the new mathematical physics of Isaac Newton. Knutzen dissuaded Kant from the theory of pre-established harmony, which he regarded as &quot;the pillow for the lazy mind&quot;. He also dissuaded Kant from idealism, the idea that reality is purely mental, which most philosophers in the 18th century regarded negatively. The theory of transcendental idealism that Kant later included in the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; was developed partially in opposition to traditional idealism. Kant had contacts with students, colleagues, friends and diners who frequented the local Masonic lodge.

His father&#x27;s stroke and subsequent death in 1746 interrupted his studies. Kant left Königsberg shortly after August 1748; he would return there in August 1754. He became a private tutor in the towns surrounding Königsberg, but continued his scholarly research. In 1749, he published his first philosophical work, &quot;Thoughts on the True Estimation of Living Forces&quot; (written in 1745–1747).

===Early work===
 Kant is best known for his work in the philosophy of ethics and metaphysics, but he made significant contributions to other disciplines. In 1754, while contemplating on a prize question by the Berlin Academy about the problem of Earth&#x27;s rotation, he argued that the Moon&#x27;s gravity would slow down Earth&#x27;s spin and he also put forth the argument that gravity would eventually cause the Moon&#x27;s tidal locking to coincide with the Earth&#x27;s rotation. The next year, he expanded this reasoning to the formation and evolution of the Solar System in his &quot;Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens&quot;. In 1755, Kant received a license to lecture in the University of Königsberg and began lecturing on a variety of topics including mathematics, physics, logic, and metaphysics. In his 1756 essay on the theory of winds, Kant laid out an original insight into the Coriolis force.

In 1756, Kant also published three papers on the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Kant&#x27;s theory, which involved shifts in huge caverns filled with hot gases, though inaccurate, was one of the first systematic attempts to explain earthquakes in natural rather than supernatural terms. In 1757, Kant began lecturing on geography making him one of the first lecturers to explicitly teach geography as its own subject. Geography was one of Kant&#x27;s most popular lecturing topics and, in 1802, a compilation by Friedrich Theodor Rink of Kant&#x27;s lecturing notes, &quot;Physical Geography&quot;, was released. After Kant became a professor in 1770, he expanded the topics of his lectures to include lectures on natural law, ethics, and anthropology, along with other topics.
In the &quot;Universal Natural History&quot;, Kant laid out the nebular hypothesis, in which he deduced that the Solar System had formed from a large cloud of gas, a nebula. Kant also correctly deduced that the Milky Way was a large disk of stars, which he theorized formed from a much larger spinning gas cloud. He further suggested that other distant &quot;nebulae&quot; might be other galaxies. These postulations opened new horizons for astronomy, for the first time extending it beyond the solar system to galactic and intergalactic realms.

From then on, Kant turned increasingly to philosophical issues, although he continued to write on the sciences throughout his life. In the early 1760s, Kant produced a series of important works in philosophy. &quot;The False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Figures&quot;, a work in logic, was published in 1762. Two more works appeared the following year: &quot;Attempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes into Philosophy&quot; and &quot;The Only Possible Argument in Support of a Demonstration of the Existence of God&quot;. By 1764, Kant had become a notable popular author, and wrote &quot;Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime&quot;; he was second to Moses Mendelssohn in a Berlin Academy prize competition with his &quot;Inquiry Concerning the Distinctness of the Principles of Natural Theology and Morality&quot; (often referred to as &quot;The Prize Essay&quot;). In 1766 Kant wrote a critical piece on Emanuel Swedenborg&#x27;s &quot;Dreams of a Spirit-Seer&quot;.

In 1770, Kant was appointed Full Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at the University of Königsberg. In defense of this appointment, Kant wrote his inaugural dissertation &quot;On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and the Intelligible World&quot;. This work saw the emergence of several central themes of his mature work, including the distinction between the faculties of intellectual thought and sensible receptivity. To miss this distinction would mean to commit the error of subreption, and, as he says in the last chapter of the dissertation, only in avoiding this error does metaphysics flourish.

It is often claimed that Kant was a late developer, that he only became an important philosopher in his mid-50s after rejecting his earlier views. While it is true that Kant wrote his greatest works relatively late in life, there is a tendency to underestimate the value of his earlier works. Recent Kant scholarship has devoted more attention to these &quot;pre-critical&quot; writings and has recognized a degree of continuity with his mature work.

===Publication of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;===
At age 46, Kant was an established scholar and an increasingly influential philosopher, and much was expected of him. In correspondence with his ex-student and friend Markus Herz, Kant admitted that, in the inaugural dissertation, he had failed to account for the relation between our sensible and intellectual faculties. He needed to explain how we combine what is known as sensory knowledge with the other type of knowledge—that is, reasoned knowledge—these two being related but having very different processes. Kant also credited David Hume with awakening him from a &quot;dogmatic slumber&quot; in which he had unquestioningly accepted the tenets of both religion and natural philosophy. Hume, in his 1739 &quot;Treatise on Human Nature&quot;, had argued that we only know the mind through a subjective, essentially illusory series of perceptions. Ideas such as causality, morality, and objects are not evident in experience, so their reality may be questioned. Kant felt that reason could remove this skepticism, and he set himself to solving these problems. Although fond of company and conversation with others, Kant isolated himself, and resisted friends&#x27; attempts to bring him out of his isolation. When Kant emerged from his silence in 1781, the result was the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, printed by Johann Friedrich Hartknoch. Kant countered Hume&#x27;s empiricism by claiming that some knowledge exists inherently in the mind, independent of experience. He drew a parallel to the Copernican revolution in his proposal that worldly objects can be intuited &quot;a priori&quot;, and that intuition is consequently distinct from objective reality. Perhaps the most direct contested matter was Hume&#x27;s argument against any necessary connection between causal events, which Hume characterized as the &quot;cement of the universe.&quot; In the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, Kant argues for what he takes to be the &quot;a priori&quot; justification of such necessary connection.
Although now recognized as one of the greatest works in the history of philosophy, the &quot;Critique&quot; disappointed Kant&#x27;s readers upon its initial publication. The book was long, over 800 pages in the original German edition, and written in a convoluted style. Kant was quite upset with its reception. His former student, Johann Gottfried Herder criticized it for placing reason as an entity worthy of criticism by itself instead of considering the process of reasoning within the context of language and one&#x27;s entire personality. Similarly to Christian Garve and Johann Georg Heinrich Feder, he rejected Kant&#x27;s position that space and time possess a form that can be analyzed. Garve and Feder also faulted the &quot;Critique&quot; for not explaining differences in perception of sensations. Its density made it, as Herder said in a letter to Johann Georg Hamann, a &quot;tough nut to crack&quot;, obscured by &quot;all this heavy gossamer&quot;. Its reception stood in stark contrast to the praise Kant had received for earlier works, such as his &quot;Prize Essay&quot; and shorter works that preceded the first &quot;Critique&quot;. Recognizing the need to clarify the original treatise, Kant wrote the &quot;Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics&quot; in 1783 as a summary of its main views. Shortly thereafter, Kant&#x27;s friend Johann Friedrich Schultz (1739–1805), a professor of mathematics, published &quot;Explanations of Professor Kant&#x27;s Critique of Pure Reason&quot; (Königsberg, 1784), which was a brief but very accurate commentary on Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;.

Kant&#x27;s reputation gradually rose through the latter portion of the 1780s, sparked by a series of important works: the 1784 essay, &quot;Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?&quot;; 1785&#x27;s &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&quot; (his first work on moral philosophy); and &quot;Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science&quot; from 1786. Kant&#x27;s fame ultimately arrived from an unexpected source. In 1786, Karl Leonhard Reinhold published a series of public letters on Kantian philosophy. In these letters, Reinhold framed Kant&#x27;s philosophy as a response to the central intellectual controversy of the era: the pantheism controversy. Friedrich Jacobi had accused the recently deceased Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (a distinguished dramatist and philosophical essayist) of Spinozism. Such a charge, tantamount to an accusation of atheism, was vigorously denied by Lessing&#x27;s friend Moses Mendelssohn, leading to a bitter public dispute among partisans. The controversy gradually escalated into a debate about the values of the Enlightenment and the value of reason. Reinhold maintained in his letters that Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; could settle this dispute by defending the authority and bounds of reason. Reinhold&#x27;s letters were widely read and made Kant the most famous philosopher of his era.

===Later work===
Kant published a second edition of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; in 1787, heavily revising the first parts of the book. Most of his subsequent work focused on other areas of philosophy. He continued to develop his moral philosophy, notably in 1788&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; (known as the second &quot;Critique&quot;), and 1797&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics of Morals&quot;. The 1790 &quot;Critique of the Power of Judgment&quot; (the third &quot;Critique&quot;) applied the Kantian system to aesthetics and teleology. In 1792, Kant&#x27;s attempt to publish the Second of the four Pieces of &quot;Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason&quot;, in the journal &quot;Berlinische Monatsschrift&quot;, met with opposition from the King&#x27;s censorship commission, which had been established that same year in the context of the French Revolution. Kant then arranged to have all four pieces published as a book, routing it through the philosophy department at the University of Jena to avoid the need for theological censorship. This insubordination earned him a now-famous reprimand from the King. When he nevertheless published a second edition in 1794, the censor was so irate that he arranged for a royal order that required Kant never to publish or even speak publicly about religion. Kant then published his response to the King&#x27;s reprimand and explained himself in the preface of &quot;The Conflict of the Faculties&quot; (1798).
He also wrote a number of semi-popular essays on history, religion, politics, and other topics. These works were well received by Kant&#x27;s contemporaries and confirmed his preeminent status in eighteenth-century philosophy. There were several journals devoted solely to defending and criticizing Kantian philosophy. Despite his success, philosophical trends were moving in another direction. Many of Kant&#x27;s most important disciples and followers (including Reinhold, Beck, and Fichte) transformed the Kantian position. The progressive stages of revision of Kant&#x27;s teachings marked the emergence of German idealism. In what was one of his final acts expounding a stance on philosophical questions, Kant opposed these developments and publicly denounced Fichte in an open letter in 1799.

In 1800, a student of Kant named Gottlob Benjamin Jäsche (1762–1842) published a manual of logic for teachers called &quot;Logik&quot;, which he had prepared at Kant&#x27;s request. Jäsche prepared the &quot;Logik&quot; using a copy of a textbook in logic by Georg Friedrich Meier entitled &quot;Excerpt from the Doctrine of Reason&quot;, in which Kant had written copious notes and annotations. The &quot;Logik&quot; has been considered of fundamental importance to Kant&#x27;s philosophy, and the understanding of it. The great 19th-century logician Charles Sanders Peirce remarked, in an incomplete review of Thomas Kingsmill Abbott&#x27;s English translation of the introduction to &quot;Logik&quot;, that &quot;Kant&#x27;s whole philosophy turns upon his logic.&quot; Also, Robert Schirokauer Hartman and Wolfgang Schwarz wrote in the translators&#x27; introduction to their English translation of the &quot;Logik&quot;, &quot;Its importance lies not only in its significance for the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, the second part of which is a restatement of fundamental tenets of the &quot;Logic&quot;, but in its position within the whole of Kant&#x27;s work.&quot;

===Death and burial===
Kant&#x27;s health, long poor, worsened. He died at Königsberg on 12 February 1804, uttering &quot;Es ist gut&quot; (&quot;It is good&quot;) before his death. His unfinished final work was published as &quot;Opus Postumum&quot;. Kant always cut a curious figure in his lifetime for his modest, rigorously scheduled habits, which have been referred to as clocklike. Heinrich Heine observed the magnitude of &quot;his destructive, world-crushing thoughts&quot; and considered him a sort of philosophical &quot;executioner&quot;, comparing him to Robespierre with the observation that both men &quot;represented in the highest the type of provincial bourgeois. Nature had destined them to weigh coffee and sugar, but Fate determined that they should weigh other things and placed on the scales of the one a king, on the scales of the other a god.&quot;

When his body was transferred to a new burial spot, his skull was measured during the exhumation and found to be larger than the average German male&#x27;s with a &quot;high and broad&quot; forehead. His forehead has been an object of interest ever since it became well known through his portraits: &quot;In Döbler&#x27;s portrait and in Kiefer&#x27;s faithful if expressionistic reproduction of it—as well as in many of the other late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century portraits of Kant—the forehead is remarkably large and decidedly retreating.&quot;
Kant&#x27;s mausoleum adjoins the northeast corner of Königsberg Cathedral in Kaliningrad, Russia. The mausoleum was constructed by the architect Friedrich Lahrs and was finished in 1924, in time for the bicentenary of Kant&#x27;s birth. Originally, Kant was buried inside the cathedral, but in 1880 his remains were moved to a neo-Gothic chapel adjoining the northeast corner of the cathedral. Over the years, the chapel became dilapidated and was demolished to make way for the mausoleum, which was built on the same location. The tomb and its mausoleum are among the few artifacts of German times preserved by the Soviets after they captured the city.

Into the 21st century, many newlyweds bring flowers to the mausoleum. Artifacts previously owned by Kant, known as &quot;Kantiana&quot;, were included in the Königsberg City Museum; however, the museum was destroyed during World War II. A replica of the statue of Kant that in German times stood in front of the main University of Königsberg building was donated by a German entity in the early 1990s and placed in the same grounds. After the expulsion of Königsberg&#x27;s German population at the end of World War II, the University of Königsberg where Kant taught was replaced by the Russian-language Kaliningrad State University, which appropriated the campus and surviving buildings. In 2005, the university was renamed Immanuel Kant State University of Russia. The name change, which was considered a politically-charged issue due to the residents having mixed feelings about its German past, was announced at a ceremony attended by Russian president Vladimir Putin and German chancellor Gerhard Schröder, and the university formed a Kant Society, dedicated to the study of Kantianism. In 2010, the university was again renamed to Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University.

==Philosophy==

Like many of his contemporaries, Kant was greatly impressed with the scientific advances made by Newton and others. This new evidence of the power of human reason called into question for many the traditional authority of politics and religion. In particular, the modern mechanistic view of the world called into question the very possibility of morality; for, if there is no agency, there cannot be any responsibility.

The aim of Kant&#x27;s critical project is to secure human autonomy, the basis of religion and morality, from this threat of mechanism—and to do so in a way that preserves the advances of modern science. In the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, Kant summarizes his philosophical concerns in the following three questions:
# What can I know?
# What should I do?
# What may I hope?
The &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; focuses upon the first question and opens a conceptual space for an answer to the second question. It argues that even though we cannot strictly &quot;know&quot; that we are free, we can—and for practical purposes, must—&quot;think&quot; of ourselves as free. In Kant&#x27;s own words, &quot;I had to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith.&quot; Our rational faith in morality is further developed in the &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&quot; and the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot;.

The &quot;Critique of the Power of Judgment&quot; argues we may &quot;rationally&quot; hope for the harmonious unity of the theoretical and practical domains treated in the first two &quot;Critiques&quot; on the basis, not only of its conceptual possibility, but also on the basis of our affective experience of natural beauty and, more generally, the organization of the natural world. In &quot;Religion within the Bounds of Mere Reason&quot;, Kant endeavors to complete his answer to this third question.

These works all place the active, rational human subject at the center of the cognitive and moral worlds. In brief, Kant argues that the mind itself necessarily makes a constitutive contribution to knowledge, that this contribution is transcendental rather than psychological, and that to act autonomously is to act according to rational moral principles.

===Kant&#x27;s critical project===

Kant&#x27;s 1781 (revised 1787) &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; has often been cited as the most significant volume of metaphysics and epistemology in modern philosophy. In the first &quot;Critique&quot;, and later on in other works as well, Kant frames the &quot;general&quot; and &quot;real problem of pure reason&quot; in terms of the following question: &quot;How are synthetic judgments &quot;a priori&quot; possible?&quot; To understand this claim, it is necessary to define some terms. First, Kant makes a distinction between two sources of knowledge:

# Cognitions &quot;a priori&quot;: &quot;cognition independent of all experience and even of all the impressions of the senses&quot;.
# Cognitions &quot;a posteriori&quot;: cognitions that have their sources in experiencethat is, which are empirical.

Second, he makes a distinction in terms of the &quot;form&quot; of knowledge:

# Analytic judgements: judgements in which the predicate concept is contained in the subject concept; e.g., &quot;All bachelors are unmarried&quot;, or &quot;All bodies take up space&quot;. These can also be called &quot;judgments of clarification&quot;.
# Synthetic judgements: judgements in which the predicate concept is not contained in the subject concept; e.g., &quot;All bachelors are alone&quot;, &quot;All swans are white&quot;, or &quot;All bodies have weight&quot;. These can also be called &quot;judgments of amplification&quot;.

An analytic judgement is true by nature of strictly conceptual relations. All analytic judgements are &quot;a priori&quot; since basing an analytic judgement on experience would be absurd. By contrast, a synthetic judgement is one the content of which includes something new in the sense that it is includes something not already contained in the subject concept. The truth or falsehood of a synthetic statement depends upon something more than what is contained in its concepts. The most obvious form of synthetic judgement is a simple empirical observation.

Philosophers such as David Hume believed that these were the only possible kinds of human reason and investigation, which Hume called &quot;relations of ideas&quot; and &quot;matters of fact&quot;. Establishing the synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; as a third mode of knowledge would allow Kant to push back against Hume&#x27;s skepticism about such matters as causation and metaphysical knowledge more generally. This is because, unlike &quot;a posteriori&quot; cognition, &quot;a priori&quot; cognition has &quot;true or strict ... universality&quot; and includes a claim of &quot;necessity&quot;. Kant himself regards it as uncontroversial that we do have synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; knowledgeespecially in mathematics. That 7 + 5 = 12, he claims, is a result not contained in the concepts of seven, five, and the addition operation. Yet, although he considers the possibility of such knowledge to be obvious, Kant nevertheless assumes the burden of providing a philosophical proof that we have &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge in mathematics, the natural sciences, and metaphysics. It is the twofold aim of the &quot;Critique&quot; both &quot;to prove&quot; and &quot;to explain&quot; the possibility of this knowledge. Kant says &quot;There are two stems of human cognition, which may perhaps arise from a common but to us unknown root, namely sensibility and understanding, through the first of which objects are &quot;given&quot; to us, but through the second of which they are &quot;thought&quot;.&quot;

Kant&#x27;s term for the object of sensibility is intuition, and his term for the object of the understanding is concept. In general terms, the former is a non-discursive representation of a &quot;particular&quot; object, and the latter is a discursive (or mediate) representation of a &quot;general type&quot; of object. The conditions of possible experience require both intuitions and concepts, that is, the affection of the receptive sensibility and the actively synthesizing power of the understanding. Thus the statement: &quot;Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind.&quot; Kant&#x27;s basic strategy in the first half of his book will be to argue that some intuitions and concepts are purethat is, are contributed entirely by the mind, independent of anything empirical. Knowledge generated on this basis, under certain conditions, can be synthetic &quot;a priori&quot;. This insight is known as Kant&#x27;s &quot;Copernican revolution&quot;, because, just as Copernicus advanced astronomy by way of a radical shift in perspective, so Kant here claims do the same for metaphysics. The second half of the &quot;Critique&quot; is the explicitly &quot;critical&quot; part. In this &quot;transcendental dialectic&quot;, Kant argues that many of the claims of traditional rationalist metaphysics violate the criteria he claims to establish in the first, &quot;constructive&quot; part of his book. As Kant observes, however, &quot;human reason, without being moved by the mere vanity of knowing it all, inexorably pushes on, driven by its own need to such questions that cannot be answered by any experiential use of reason&quot;. It is the project of &quot;the critique of pure reason&quot; to establish the limits as to just how far reason may legitimately so proceed.

=== Doctrine of transcendental idealism ===

The section of the &quot;Critique&quot; entitled &quot;The transcendental aesthetic&quot; introduces Kant&#x27;s famous metaphysics of transcendental idealism. Something is &quot;transcendental&quot; if it is a necessary condition for the possibility of experience, and &quot;idealism&quot; denotes some form of mind-dependence that must be further specified. The correct interpretation of Kant&#x27;s own specification remains controversial. The metaphysical thesis then states that human beings only experience and know phenomenal appearances, not independent things-in-themselves, because space and time are nothing but the subjective forms of intuition that we ourselves contribute to experience. Nevertheless, although Kant says that space and time are &quot;transcendentally ideal&quot;—the &quot;pure forms&quot; of human sensibility, rather than part of nature or reality as it exists in-itself—he also claims that they are &quot;empirically real&quot;, by which he means &quot;that &#x27;everything that can come before us externally as an object&#x27; is in both space and time, and that our internal intuitions of ourselves are in time&quot;. However Kant&#x27;s doctrine is interpreted, he wished to distinguish his position from the subjective idealism of Berkeley.

Paul Guyer, although critical of many of Kant&#x27;s arguments in this section, writes of the &quot;Transcendental Aesthetic&quot; that it &quot;not only lays the first stone in Kant&#x27;s constructive theory of knowledge; it also lays the foundation for both his critique and his reconstruction of traditional metaphysics. It argues that all genuine knowledge requires a sensory component, and thus that metaphysical claims that transcend the possibility of sensory confirmation can never amount to knowledge.&quot;

====Interpretive disagreements====
One interpretation, known as the &quot;two-world&quot; interpretation, regards Kant&#x27;s position as a statement of epistemological limitation, meaning that we are not able to transcend the bounds of our own mind, and therefore cannot access the &quot;thing-in-itself&quot;. On this particular view, the thing-in-itself is not numerically identical to the phenomenal empirical object. Kant also spoke, however, of the thing-in-itself or &quot;transcendent object&quot; as a product of the (human) understanding as it attempts to conceive of objects in abstraction from the conditions of sensibility. Following this line of thought, a different interpretation argues that the thing-in-itself does not represent a separate ontological domain but simply a way of considering objects by means of the understanding alone; this is known as the &quot;two-aspect&quot; view. On this alternative view, the same objects to which we attribute empirical properties like color, size, and shape are also, when considered as they are in themselves, the things-in-themselves, otherwise inaccessible to human knowledge.

===Kant&#x27;s theory of judgment===

Following the &quot;Transcendental Analytic&quot; is the &quot;Transcendental Logic&quot;. Whereas the former was concerned with the contributions of the sensibility, the latter is concerned, first, with the contributions of the understanding (&quot;Transcendental Analytic&quot;) and, second, with the faculty of &quot;reason&quot; as the source of both metaphysical errors and genuine regulatory principles (&quot;Transcendental Dialectic&quot;). The &quot;Transcendental Analytic&quot; is further divided into two sections. The first, &quot;Analytic of Concepts&quot;, is concerned with establishing the universality and necessity of the &quot;pure&quot; concepts of the understanding (i.e., the categories). This section contains Kant&#x27;s famous &quot;transcendental deduction&quot;. The second, &quot;Analytic of Principles&quot;, is concerned with the application of those pure concepts in &quot;empirical&quot; judgments. This second section is longer than the first and is further divided into many sub-sections.

====Transcendental deduction of the categories of the understanding====
The &quot;Analytic of Concepts&quot; argues for the universal and necessary validity of the pure concepts of the understanding, or the categories, for instance, the concepts of substance and causation. These twelve basic categories define what it is to be a &quot;thing in general&quot;that is, they articulate the necessary conditions according to which something is a possible object of experience. These, in conjunction with the &quot;a priori&quot; forms of intuition, are the basis of all synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; cognition. According to Guyer and Wood, &quot;Kant&#x27;s idea is that just as there are certain essential features of all judgments, so there must be certain corresponding ways in which we form the concepts of objects so that judgments may be about objects.&quot;

Kant provides two central lines of argumentation in support of his claims about the categories. The first, known as the &quot;metaphysical deduction&quot;, proceeds analytically from a table of the Aristotelian logical functions of judgment. As Kant was aware, this assumes precisely what the skeptic rejects, namely, the existence of synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; cognition. For this reason, Kant also supplies a synthetic argument that does not depend upon the assumption in dispute.

This argument, provided under the heading &quot;Transcendental Deduction of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding&quot;, is widely considered to be both the most important and the most difficult of Kant&#x27;s arguments in the &quot;Critique&quot;. Kant himself said that it is the one that cost him the most labor. Frustrated by its confused reception in the first edition of his book, he rewrote it entirely for the second edition.

The &quot;Transcendental Deduction&quot; gives Kant&#x27;s argument that these pure concepts apply universally and necessarily to the objects that are given in experience. According to Guyer and Wood, &quot;He centers his argument on the premise that our experience can be ascribed to a single identical subject, via what he calls the &#x27;transcendental unity of apperception,&#x27; only if the elements of experience given in intuition are synthetically combined so as to present us with objects that are thought through the categories.&quot;

Kant&#x27;s principle of apperception is that &quot;The I think must be able to accompany all my representations; for otherwise something would be represented in me that could not be thought at all, which is as much as to say that the representation would either be impossible or else at least would be nothing for me.&quot; The &quot;necessary&quot; possibility of the self-ascription of the representations of self-consciousness, identical to itself through time, is an &quot;a priori&quot; conceptual truth that cannot be based on experience. This is only a bare sketch of one of the arguments that Kant presents.

====Principles of pure understanding====
Kant&#x27;s deduction of the categories in the &quot;Analytic of Concepts&quot;, if successful, demonstrates its claims about the categories only in an abstract way. The task of the &quot;Analytic of Principles&quot; is to show both &quot;that&quot; they must universally apply to objects given in actual experience (i.e., manifolds of intuition) and &quot;how&quot; it is they do so. In the first book of this section on the &quot;schematism&quot;, Kant connects each of the purely logical categories of the understanding to the temporality of intuition to show that, although non-empirical, they do have purchase upon the objects of experience. The second book continues this line of argument in four chapters, each associated with one of the category groupings. In some cases, it adds a connection to the spatial dimension of intuition to the categories it analyzes. The fourth chapter of this section, &quot;The Analogies of Experience&quot;, marks a shift from &quot;mathematical&quot; to &quot;dynamical&quot; principles, that is, to those that deal with relations among objects. Some commentators consider this the most significant section of the &quot;Critique&quot;. The analogies are three in number:

# &quot;Principle of persistence of substance&quot;: Kant is here concerned with the general conditions of determining time-relations among the objects of experience. He argues that the unity of time implies that &quot;all change must consist in the alteration of states in an underlying substance, whose existence and quantity must be unchangeable or conserved.&quot;
# &quot;Principle of temporal succession according to the law of causality&quot;: Here Kant argues that &quot;we can make determinate judgments about the objective succession of events, as contrasted to merely subjective successions of representations, only if every objective alteration follows a necessary rule of succession, or a causal law.&quot; This is Kant&#x27;s most direct rejoinder to Hume&#x27;s skepticism about causality.
# &quot;Principle of simultaneity according to the law of reciprocity or community&quot;: The final analogy argues that &quot;determinate judgments that objects (or states of substance) in different regions of space exists simultaneously are possible only if such objects stand in mutual causal relation of community or reciprocal interaction.&quot; This is Kant&#x27;s rejoinder to Leibniz&#x27;s thesis in the &quot;Monadology&quot;.

The fourth section of this chapter, which is not an analogy, deals with the empirical use of the modal categories. That was the end of the chapter in the A edition of the &quot;Critique&quot;. The B edition includes one more short section, &quot;The Refutation of Idealism&quot;. In this section, by analysis of the concept of self-consciousness, Kant argues that his transcendental idealism is a &quot;critical&quot; or &quot;formal&quot; idealism that does not deny the existence of reality apart from our subjective representations. The final chapter of &quot;The Analytic of Principles&quot; distinguishes &quot;phenomena&quot;, of which we can have genuine knowledge, from &quot;noumena&quot;, a term which refers to objects of pure thought that we cannot know, but to which we may still refer &quot;in a negative sense&quot;. An Appendix to the section further develops Kant&#x27;s criticism of Leibnizian-Wolffian rationalism by arguing that its &quot;dogmatic&quot; metaphysics confuses the &quot;mere features of concepts through which we think things ... [with] features of the objects themselves&quot;. Against this, Kant reasserts his own insistence upon the necessity of a sensible component in all genuine knowledge.

===Critique of metaphysics===
The second of the two Divisions of &quot;The Transcendental Logic&quot;, &quot;The Transcendental Dialectic&quot;, contains the &quot;negative&quot; portion of Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique&quot;, which builds upon the &quot;positive&quot; arguments of the preceding &quot;Transcendental Analytic&quot; to expose the limits of metaphysical speculation. In particular, it is concerned to demonstrate as spurious the efforts of reason to arrive at knowledge independent of sensibility. This endeavor, Kant argues, is doomed to failure, which he claims to demonstrate by showing that reason, unbounded by sense, is always capable of generating opposing or otherwise incompatible conclusions. Like &quot;the light dove, in free flight cutting through the air, the resistance of which it feels&quot;, reason &quot;could get the idea that it could do even better in airless space&quot;. Against this, Kant claims that, absent epistemic friction, there can be no knowledge. Nevertheless, Kant&#x27;s critique is not entirely destructive. He presents the speculative excesses of traditional metaphysics as inherent in our very capacity of reason. Moreover, he argues that its products are not without some (carefully qualified) &quot;regulative&quot; value.

====On the concepts of pure reason====
Kant calls the basic concepts of metaphysics &quot;ideas&quot;. They are different from the concepts of understanding in that they are not limited by the critical stricture limiting knowledge to the conditions of possible experience and its objects. &quot;Transcendental illusion&quot; is Kant&#x27;s term for the tendency of reason to produce such ideas. Although reason has a &quot;logical use&quot; of simply drawing inferences from principles, in &quot;The Transcendental Dialectic&quot;, Kant is concerned with its purportedly &quot;real use&quot; to arrive at conclusions by way of unchecked regressive syllogistic ratiocination. The three categories of &quot;relation&quot;, pursued without regard to the limits of possible experience, yield the three central ideas of traditional metaphysics:

# &quot;The soul&quot;: the concept of substance as the ultimate subject;
# &quot;The world in its entirety&quot;: the concept of causation as a completed series; and
# &quot;God&quot;: the concept of community as the common ground of all possibilities.

Although Kant denies that these ideas can be objects of genuine cognition, he argues that they are the result of reason&#x27;s inherent drive to unify cognition into a systematic whole. Leibnizian-Wolffian metaphysics was divided into four parts: ontology, psychology, cosmology, and theology. Kant replaces the first with the positive results of the first part of the &quot;Critique&quot;. He proposes to replace the following three with his later doctrines of anthropology, the metaphysical foundations of natural science, and the critical postulation of human freedom and morality.

====Dialectical inferences of pure reason====
In the second of the two Books of &quot;The Transcendental Dialectic&quot;, Kant undertakes to demonstrate the contradictory nature of unbounded reason. He does this by developing contradictions in each of the three metaphysical disciplines that he contends are in fact pseudosciences. This section of the &quot;Critique&quot; is long and Kant&#x27;s arguments are extremely detailed. In this context, it not possible to do much more than enumerate the topics of discussion. The first chapter addresses what Kant terms the &quot;paralogisms&quot;i.e., false inferencesthat pure reason makes in the metaphysical discipline of rational psychology. He argues that one cannot take the mere thought of &quot;I&quot; in the proposition &quot;I think&quot; as the proper cognition of &quot;I&quot; as an object. In this way, he claims to debunk various metaphysical theses about the substantiality, unity, and self-identity of the soul. The second chapter, which is the longest, takes up the topic Kant calls the &quot;antinomies of pure reason&quot;that is, the contradictions of reason with itselfin the metaphysical discipline of rational cosmology. Originally, Kant had thought that all transcendental illusion could be analyzed in antinomic terms. He presents four cases in which he claims reason is able to prove opposing theses with equal plausibility:

# That &quot;reason seems to be able to prove that the universe is both finite and infinite in space and time&quot;;
# that &quot;reason seems to be able to prove that matter both is and is not infinitely divisible into ever smaller parts&quot;;
# that &quot;reason seems to be able to prove that free will cannot be a causally efficacious part of the world (because all of nature is deterministic) and yet that it must be such a cause&quot;; and,
# that &quot;reason seems to be able to prove that there is and there is not a necessary being (which some would identify with God)&quot;.

Kant further argues in each case that his doctrine of transcendental idealism is able to resolve the antinomy. The third chapter examines fallacious arguments about God in rational theology under the heading of the &quot;Ideal of Pure Reason&quot;. (Whereas an &quot;idea&quot; is a pure concept generated by reason, an &quot;ideal&quot; is the concept of an idea as an &quot;individual thing&quot;.) Here Kant addresses and claims to refute three traditional arguments for the existence of God: the ontological argument, the cosmological argument, and the physio-theological argument (i.e., the argument from design). The results of the transcendental dialectic so far appear to be entirely negative. In an Appendix to this section, Kant rejects such a conclusion. The ideas of pure reason, he argues, have an important &quot;regulatory&quot; function in directing and organizing our theoretical and practical inquiry. Kant&#x27;s later works elaborate upon this function at length and in detail.

===Moral thought===

Kant developed his ethics, or moral philosophy, in three works: &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&quot; (1785), &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; (1788), and &quot;Metaphysics of Morals&quot; (1797).
With regard to morality, Kant argued that the source of the good lies not in anything outside the human subject, either in nature or given by God, but rather is only the good will itself. A good will is one that acts from duty in accordance with the universal moral law that the autonomous human being freely gives itself. This law obliges one to treat humanityunderstood as rational agency, and represented through oneself as well as othersas an end in itself rather than (merely) as means to other ends the individual might hold. Kant is known for his theory that all moral obligation is grounded in what he calls the &quot;categorical imperative&quot;, which is derived from the concept of duty. He argues that the moral law is a principle of reason itself, not based on contingent facts about the world, such as what would make us happy; to act on the moral law has no other motive than &quot;worthiness to be happy&quot;.

====Idea of freedom====
In the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, Kant distinguishes between the transcendental idea of freedom, which as a psychological concept is &quot;mainly empirical&quot; and refers to &quot;whether a faculty of beginning a series of successive things or states from itself is to be assumed&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kant, CPuR A448/B467&quot;&gt;Kant, &quot;CPuR&quot; A448/B467&lt;/ref&gt; and the practical concept of freedom as the independence of our will from the &quot;coercion&quot; or &quot;necessitation through sensuous impulses&quot;. Kant finds it a source of difficulty that the practical idea of freedom is founded on the transcendental idea of freedom, but for the sake of practical interests uses the practical meaning, taking &quot;no account of ... its transcendental meaning&quot;, which he feels was properly &quot;disposed of&quot; in the Third Antinomy, and as an element in the question of the freedom of the will is for philosophy &quot;a real stumbling block&quot; that has embarrassed speculative reason.

Kant calls &quot;practical&quot; &quot;everything that is possible through freedom&quot;; he calls the pure practical laws that are never given through sensuous conditions, but are held analogously with the universal law of causality, moral laws. Reason can give us only the &quot;pragmatic laws of free action through the senses&quot;, but pure practical laws given by reason &quot;a priori&quot; dictate &quot;what is to be done&quot;. Kant&#x27;s categories of freedom function primarily as conditions for the possibility for actions (i) to be free, (ii) to be understood as free, and (iii) to be morally evaluated. For Kant, although actions as theoretical objects are constituted by means of the theoretical categories, actions as practical objects (objects of practical use of reason, and which can be good or bad) are constituted by means of the categories of freedom. Only in this way can actions, as phenomena, be a consequence of freedom, and be understood and evaluated as such.

====Categorical imperative====
Kant makes a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A &quot;hypothetical&quot; imperative is one that must be obeyed to satisfy contingent desires. A &quot;categorical&quot; imperative binds rational agents regardless of their desires: for example, all rational agents have a duty to respect other rational agents as individual ends in themselves, regardless of circumstances, even though it is sometimes in one&#x27;s selfish interest to not do so. These imperatives are morally binding because of the categorical form of their maxims, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative, because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times. Stated in other terms, with all forms of instrumental rationality excluded from morality, &quot;the moral law itself, Kant holds, can only be the form of lawfulness itself, because nothing else is left once all content has been rejected&quot;.

Kant provides three formulations for the categorical imperative. He claims that these are necessarily equivalent, as all being expressions of the pure universality of the moral law as such; many scholars are not convinced. The formulas are as follows:
* &quot;Formula of Universal Law&quot;:
**&quot;Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you at the same time can will that it become a universal law&quot;; alternatively,
***&quot;Formula of the Law of Nature&quot;: &quot;So act, as if the maxim of your action were to become through your will a universal law of nature.&quot;
* &quot;Formula of Humanity as End in Itself&quot;:
**&quot;So act that you use humanity, as much in your own person as in the person of every other, always at the same time as an end and never merely as a means&quot;.
* &quot;Formula of Autonomy&quot;:
**&quot;the idea of the will of every rational being as a will giving universal law&quot;, or &quot;Not to choose otherwise than so that the maxims of one&#x27;s choice are at the same time comprehended with it in the same volition as universal law&quot;; alternatively,
***&quot;Formula of the Realm of Ends&quot;: &quot;Act in accordance with maxims of a universally legislative member for a merely possible realm of ends.&quot;

Kant defines &quot;maxim&quot; as a &quot;subjective principle of volition&quot;, which is distinguished from an &quot;objective principle or &#x27;practical law. While &quot;the latter is valid for every rational being and is a &#x27;principle according to which they ought to act[,]&#x27; a maxim &#x27;contains the practical rule which reason determines in accordance with the conditions of the subject (often their ignorance or inclinations) and is thus the principle according to which the subject does act.

Maxims fail to qualify as practical laws if they produce a contradiction in conception or a contradiction in the will when universalized. A contradiction in conception happens when, if a maxim were to be universalized, it ceases to make sense, because the &quot;maxim would necessarily destroy itself as soon as it was made a universal law&quot;. For example, if the maxim &#x27;It is permissible to break promises&#x27; was universalized, no one would trust any promises made, so the idea of a promise would become meaningless; the maxim would be self-contradictory because, when it is universalized, promises cease to be meaningful. The maxim is not moral because it is logically impossible to universalizethat is, we could not conceive of a world where this maxim was universalized. A maxim can also be immoral if it creates a contradiction in the will when universalized. This does not mean a logical contradiction, but that universalizing the maxim leads to a state of affairs that no &quot;rational&quot; being would desire.

====&quot;The Doctrine of Virtue&quot;====
As Kant explains in the 1785 &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&quot; and as its title directly indicates, that text is &quot;nothing more than the search for and establishment of the &quot;supreme principle of morality&quot;&quot;. His promised &quot;Metaphysics of Morals&quot; was much delayed and did not appear until its two parts, &quot;The Doctrine of Right&quot; and &quot;The Doctrine of Virtue&quot;, were published separately in 1797 and 1798. The first deals with political philosophy, the second with ethics. &quot;The Doctrine of Virtue&quot; provides &quot;a very different account of ordinary moral reasoning&quot; than the one suggested by the &quot;Groundwork&quot;. It is concerned with &quot;duties of virtue&quot; or &quot;ends that are at the same time duties&quot;. It is here, in the domain of ethics, that the greatest innovation by &quot;The Metaphysics of Morals&quot; is to be found. According to Kant&#x27;s account, &quot;ordinary moral reasoning is fundamentally teleologicalit is reasoning about what ends we are constrained by morality to pursue, and the priorities among these ends we are required to observe&quot;.

There are two sorts of ends that it is our duty to have: our own perfection and the happiness of others (&quot;MS&quot; 6:385). &quot;Perfection&quot; includes both our natural perfection (the development of our talents, skills, and capacities of understanding) and moral perfection (our virtuous disposition) (&quot;MS&quot; 6:387). A person&#x27;s &quot;happiness&quot; is the greatest rational whole of the ends the person set for the sake of her own satisfaction (&quot;MS&quot; 6:387–388).

Kant&#x27;s elaboration of this teleological doctrine offers up a moral theory very different from the one typically attributed to him on the basis of his foundational works alone.

===Political philosophy===

In &quot;Towards Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Project&quot;, Kant listed several conditions that he thought necessary for ending wars and creating a lasting peace. They included a world of constitutional republics. His classical republican theory was extended in the &quot;Doctrine of Right&quot;, the first part of the &quot;Metaphysics of Morals&quot; (1797). Kant believed that universal history leads to the ultimate world of republican states at peace, but his theory was not pragmatic. The process was described in &quot;Perpetual Peace&quot; as natural rather than rational:
Kant&#x27;s political thought can be summarized as republican government and international organization: &quot;In more characteristically Kantian terms, it is doctrine of the state based upon the law (&quot;Rechtsstaat&quot;) and of eternal peace. Indeed, in each of these formulations, both terms express the same idea: that of legal constitution or of &#x27;peace through law. &quot;Kant&#x27;s political philosophy, being essentially a legal doctrine, rejects by definition the opposition between moral education and the play of passions as alternate foundations for social life. The state is defined as the union of men under law. The state rightly so called is constituted by laws which are necessary a priori because they flow from the very concept of law. A regime can be judged by no other criteria nor be assigned any other functions, than those proper to the lawful order as such.&quot;

Kant opposed &quot;democracy&quot;, which at his time meant direct democracy, believing that majority rule posed a threat to individual liberty. He stated that &quot;&quot;democracy&quot; in the strict sense of the word is necessarily a &quot;despotism&quot; because it establishes an executive power in which all decide for and, if need be, against one (who thus does not agree), so that all, who are nevertheless not all, decide; and this is a contradiction of the general will with itself and with freedom.&quot;

As with most writers at the time, Kant distinguished three forms of governmentnamely, democracy, aristocracy, and monarchywith mixed government as the most ideal form of it. He believed in republican ideals and forms of governance, and rule of law brought on by them. Although Kant published this as a &quot;popular piece&quot;, Mary J. Gregor points out that two years later, in &quot;The Metaphysics of Morals&quot;, Kant claims to demonstrate &quot;systematically&quot; that &quot;establishing universal and lasting peace constitutes not merely a part of the doctrine of right, but rather the entire final end of the doctrine of right within the limits of mere reason&quot;.

&quot;The Doctrine of Right&quot;, published in 1797, contains Kant&#x27;s most mature and systematic contribution to political philosophy. It addresses duties according to law, which are &quot;concerned only with protecting the external freedom of individuals&quot; and indifferent to incentives. Although there is a moral duty &quot;to limit ourselves to actions that are right, that duty is not part of [right] itself&quot;. Its basic political idea is that &quot;each person&#x27;s entitlement to be his or her own master is only consistent with the entitlements of others if public legal institutions are in place&quot;. He formulates the universal principle of right as:
===Religious writings===

Starting in the 20th century, commentators tended to see Kant as having a strained relationship with religion, although in the nineteenth century this had not been the prevalent view. Karl Leonhard Reinhold, whose letters helped make Kant famous, wrote: &quot;I believe that I may infer without reservation that the interest of religion, and of Christianity in particular, accords completely with the result of the Critique of Reason.&quot; According to Johann Schultz, who wrote one of the first commentaries on Kant: &quot;And does not this system itself cohere most splendidly with the Christian religion? Do not the divinity and beneficence of the latter become all the more evident?&quot; The reason for these views was Kant&#x27;s moral theology and the widespread belief that his philosophy was the great antithesis to Spinozism, which was widely seen as a form of sophisticated pantheism or even atheism. As Kant&#x27;s philosophy disregarded the possibility of arguing for God through pure reason alone, for the same reasons it also disregarded the possibility of arguing against God through pure reason alone.

Kant directs his strongest criticisms of the organization and practices of religious organizations at those that encourage what he sees as a religion of counterfeit service to God. Among the major targets of his criticism are external ritual, superstition, and a hierarchical church order. He sees these as efforts to make oneself pleasing to God in ways other than conscientious adherence to the principle of moral rightness in choosing and acting upon one&#x27;s maxims. Kant&#x27;s criticisms on these matters, along with his rejection of certain theoretical proofs for the existence of God that were grounded in pure reason (particularly the ontological argument) and his philosophical commentary on some Christian doctrines, have resulted in interpretations that see Kant as hostile to religion in general and to Christianity in particular. Other interpreters, nevertheless, consider that Kant was trying to mark off defensible from indefensible Christian belief.

Regarding Kant&#x27;s conception of religion, some critics have argued that he was sympathetic to deism. Other critics have argued that Kant&#x27;s moral conception moves from deism to theism (as moral theism), for example Allen W. Wood, as well as Merold Westphal. As for Kant&#x27;s book &quot;Religion within the Bounds of Mere Reason&quot;, it was emphasized that Kant reduced religiosity to rationality, religion to morality, and Christianity to ethics; however, many interpreters, including Wood, alongside Lawrence Pasternack, now agree with Stephen Palmquist&#x27;s claim that a better way of reading Kant&#x27;s &quot;Religion&quot; is to see him as raising morality to the status of religion.

=== Aesthetics ===

Kant discusses the subjective nature of aesthetic qualities and experiences in &quot;Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime&quot; (1764). Kant&#x27;s contribution to aesthetic theory is developed in the &quot;Critique of the Power of Judgment&quot; (1790), where he investigates the possibility and logical status of &quot;judgments of taste&quot;. In the &quot;Critique of Aesthetic Judgment&quot;, the first major division of the &quot;Critique of the Power of Judgment&quot;, Kant used the term &quot;aesthetic&quot; in a manner that resembles its modern sense. In the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, to note essential differences between judgments of taste, moral judgments, and scientific judgments, Kant abandoned the term &quot;aesthetic&quot; as &quot;designating the critique of taste&quot;, noting that judgments of taste could never be &quot;directed&quot; by &quot;laws &quot;a priori&quot;&quot;. After A. G. Baumgarten, who wrote &quot;Aesthetica&quot; (1750–58), Kant was one of the first philosophers to develop and integrate aesthetic theory into a unified and comprehensive philosophical system, utilizing ideas that played an integral role throughout his philosophy. In the chapter &quot;Analytic of the Beautiful&quot; in the &quot;Critique of the Power of Judgment&quot;, Kant states that beauty is not a property of an artwork or natural phenomenon, but is instead consciousness of the pleasure that attends the &#x27;free play&#x27; of the imagination and the understanding. Even though it appears that we are using reason to decide what is beautiful, the judgment is not a cognitive judgment, &quot;and is consequently not logical, but aesthetical&quot;.

A pure judgement of taste is subjective since it refers to the emotional response of the subject and is based upon nothing but esteem for an object itself: it is a disinterested pleasure, and we feel that pure judgements of taste (i.e., judgements of beauty), lay claim to universal validity. This universal validity is not derived from a determinate concept of beauty but from &quot;common sense&quot;. Kant also believed that a judgment of taste shares characteristics with a moral judgment: both are disinterested, and we hold them to be universal. In the chapter &quot;Analytic of the Sublime,&quot; Kant identifies the sublime as an aesthetic quality that, like beauty, is subjective, but unlike beauty, it refers to an indeterminate relationship between the faculties of the imagination and reason. It also shares the character of moral judgments in its engagement with reason. The feeling of the sublime, divided into two distinct modes (the mathematical and the dynamical sublime), describes two subjective moments that concern the relationship of the faculty of the imagination to reason. Some commentators argue that Kant&#x27;s critical philosophy contains a third kind of the sublime, the moral sublime, which is the aesthetic response to the moral law or a representation, and a development of the &quot;noble&quot; sublime in Kant&#x27;s theory of 1764.

The mathematical sublime results from the failure of the imagination to comprehend natural objects that appear boundless and formless, or appear &quot;absolutely great&quot;. This imaginative failure is then recuperated through the pleasure taken in reason&#x27;s assertion of the concept of infinity. In this move the faculty of reason proves itself superior to our fallible sensible self. In the dynamical sublime, there is the sense of annihilation of the sensible self as the imagination tries to comprehend a vast might. This power of nature threatens us but through the resistance of reason to such sensible annihilation, the subject feels a pleasure and a sense of the human moral vocation. This appreciation of moral feeling through exposure to the sublime helps to develop moral character. Kant developed a theory of humor, which has been interpreted as an &quot;incongruity&quot; theory. He illustrated his theory of humor by telling three narrative jokes in the &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot;. He thought that the physiological impact of humor is akin to that of music.

Kant developed a distinction between an object of art as a material value subject to the conventions of society and the transcendental condition of the judgment of taste as a &quot;refined&quot; value in his &quot;Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Aim&quot; (1784). In the Fourth and Fifth Theses of that work he identified all art as the &quot;fruits of unsociableness&quot; due to men&#x27;s &quot;antagonism in society&quot; and, in the Seventh Thesis, asserted that while such material property is indicative of a civilized state, only the ideal of morality and the universalization of refined value through the improvement of the mind &quot;belongs to culture&quot;.

===Anthropology===
Kant lectured on anthropology, the study of human nature, for twenty-three years. His &quot;Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View&quot; was published in 1798. Transcripts of Kant&#x27;s lectures on anthropology were published for the first time in 1997 in German. Kant was among the first people of his time to introduce anthropology as an intellectual area of study, long before the field gained popularity, and his texts are considered to have advanced the field. His point of view was to influence the works of later philosophers such as Martin Heidegger and Paul Ricoeur.

Kant was the first to suggest using a dimensionality approach to human diversity. He analyzed the nature of the Hippocrates-Galen four temperaments and plotted in two dimensions &quot;what belongs to a human being&#x27;s faculty of desire&quot;:
&quot;his natural aptitude or natural predisposition&quot; and &quot;his temperament or sensibility&quot;. Cholerics were described as emotional and energetic, phlegmatics as balanced and weak, sanguines as balanced and energetic, and melancholics as emotional and weak. These two dimensions reappeared in all subsequent models of temperament and personality traits. Kant viewed anthropology in two broad categories: (1) the physiological approach, which he referred to as &quot;what nature makes of the human being&quot;; and (2) the pragmatic approach, which explores the things that a human &quot;can and should make of himself&quot;.

====Racism====
Kant&#x27;s theory of race and his prejudicial beliefs are among the most contentious areas of recent Kant scholarship. While few, if any, dispute the overt racism and chauvinism present in his work, a more contested question is the degree to which it degrades or invalidates his other contributions. His most severe critics assert that Kant intentionally manipulated science to support chattel slavery and discrimination. Others acknowledge that he lived in an era of immature science, with many erroneous beliefs, some racist, all appearing decades before evolution, molecular genetics, and other sciences that today are taken for granted. Kant was one of the most notable Enlightenment thinkers to defend racism. Philosopher Charles W. Mills is unequivocal: &quot;Kant is also seen as one of the central figures in the birth of modern &#x27;scientific&#x27; racism. Whereas other contributors to early racial thought like Carolus Linnaeus and Johann Friedrich Blumenbach had offered only &#x27;empirical&#x27; (scare-quotes necessary!) observation, Kant produced a full-blown &quot;theory&quot; of race.&quot;

Using the four temperaments of ancient Greece, Kant proposed a hierarchy of racial categories including white Europeans, black Africans, and red Native Americans. Although he was a proponent of scientific racism for much of his career, Kant&#x27;s views on race changed significantly in the last decade of his life, and he ultimately rejected racial hierarchies and European colonialism in &quot;Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch&quot; (1795). Kant was an opponent of miscegenation, believing that whites would be &quot;degraded&quot; and that &quot;fusing of races&quot; is undesirable, for &quot;not every race adopts the morals and customs of the Europeans&quot;. He states that &quot;instead of assimilation, which was intended by the melting together of the various races, nature has here made a law of just the opposite&quot;. Kant was also an anti-Semite, believing that Jews were incapable of transcending material forces, which a moral order required. In this way, Jews are presented as the opposite of autonomous, rational Christians, and therefore incapable of being incorporated into an ethical Christian society. In his &quot;Anthropology&quot;, Kant called the Jews &quot;a nation of cheaters&quot; and portrayed them as &quot;a group that has followed not the path of transcendental freedom but that of enslavement to the material world&quot;.

Mills wrote that Kant has been &quot;sanitized for public consumption&quot;, his racist works conveniently ignored. Robert Bernasconi stated that Kant &quot;supplied the first scientific definition of race&quot;. Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze is credited with bringing Kant&#x27;s contributions to racism to light in the 1990s among Western philosophers, who he believed often glossed over this part of his life and works. Pauline Kleingeld argues that, while Kant &quot;did defend a racial hierarchy until at least the end of the 1780s&quot;, his views on race changed significantly in works published in the last decade of his life. In particular, she argues that Kant rejected past views related to racial hierarchies and the diminished rights or moral status of non-whites in &quot;Perpetual Peace&quot; (1795). This work also saw him providing extended arguments against European colonialism, which he claimed was morally unjust and incompatible with the equal rights held by indigenous populations. Kleingeld argues that this shift in Kant&#x27;s views later in life has often been forgotten or ignored in the literature on Kant&#x27;s racist anthropology, and that the shift suggests a belated recognition of the fact that racial hierarchy was incompatible with a universalized moral framework.

While Kant&#x27;s racist rhetoric is indicative of the state of scholarship and science during the 18th century, German philosopher Daniel-Pascal Zorn explains the risk of taking period quotations out of context. Many of Kant&#x27;s most outrageous quotations are from a series of articles from 1777–1788, a public exchange among Kant, Herder, natural scientist Georg Forster, and other scholars prominent in that period. Kant asserts that all races of humankind are of the same species, challenging the position of Forster and others that the races were distinct species. While his commentary is clearly biased at times, certain extreme statements were patterned specifically to paraphrase or counter Forster and other authors. By considering the full arc of Kant&#x27;s scholarship, Zorn notes the progression in both his philosophical and his anthropological works, &quot;with which he argues, against the &quot;zeitgeist&quot;, for the unity of humanity&quot;.

==Influence and legacy==

Kant&#x27;s influence on Western thought has been profound. Although the basic tenets of Kant&#x27;s transcendental idealism (i.e., that space and time are &quot;a priori&quot; forms of human perception rather than real properties and the claim that formal logic and transcendental logic coincide) have been claimed to be falsified by modern science and logic, and no longer set the intellectual agenda of contemporary philosophers, Kant is credited with having innovated the way philosophical inquiry has been carried on at least up to the early nineteenth century. This shift consisted of several closely related innovations that, although highly contentious in themselves, have become important in subsequent philosophy and in the social sciences broadly construed:
* The human subject seen as the center of inquiry into human knowledge, such that it is impossible to philosophize about things as they exist independently of human perception or of how they are &quot;for us&quot;;
* the notion that is possible to discover and systematically explore the inherent limits of the human ability to know entirely &quot;a priori&quot;;
* the notion of the &quot;categorical imperative&quot;, an assertion that people are naturally endowed with the ability and obligation toward right reason and acting. Perhaps his most famous quote is drawn from the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot;: &quot;Two things fill my mind with ever new and increasing admiration and reverence ... : &quot;the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me&quot;&quot;;
* the concept of &quot;conditions of possibility&quot;, as in his notion of &quot;the conditions of possible experience&quot;; that is, that things, knowledge, and forms of consciousness rest on prior conditions that make them possible, so that, to understand or to know them, several conditions must be understood:
:* the claim that objective experience is actively constituted or constructed by the functioning of the human mind;
:* the concept of moral autonomy as central to humanity; and
:* the assertion of the principle that human beings should be treated as ends rather than as mere means.

Kant&#x27;s ideas have been incorporated into a variety of schools of thought. These include German idealism, Marxism, positivism, phenomenology, existentialism, critical theory, linguistic philosophy, structuralism, post-structuralism, and deconstruction.

===Historical influence===

During his own life, much critical attention was paid to Kant&#x27;s thought. He influenced Reinhold, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, and Novalis during the 1780s and 1790s. Samuel Taylor Coleridge was greatly influenced by Kant and helped to spread awareness of him, and of German Idealism generally, in the UK and the US. In his &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot; (1817), he credits Kant&#x27;s ideas in coming to believe that the mind is not a passive, but an active agent in the apprehension of reality. Hegel was one of Kant&#x27;s first major critics. In Hegel&#x27;s view the entire project of setting a &quot;transcendental subject&quot; (i.e., human consciousness) apart from the living individual as well as from nature, history, and society was fundamentally flawed, although parts of that very project could be put to good use in a new direction. Similar concerns motivated Hegel&#x27;s criticisms of Kant&#x27;s concept of moral autonomy, to which Hegel opposed an ethic focused on the &quot;ethical life&quot; of the community. In a sense, Hegel&#x27;s notion of &quot;ethical life&quot; is meant to subsume, rather than replace, Kantian ethics. And Hegel can be seen as trying to defend Kant&#x27;s idea of freedom as going beyond finite &quot;desires&quot;, by means of reason. Thus, in contrast to later critics like Nietzsche or Russell, Hegel shares some of Kant&#x27;s concerns.

Kant&#x27;s thinking on religion was used in Britain by philosophers such as Thomas Carlyle to challenge the nineteenth-century decline in religious faith. British Catholic writers, notably G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc, followed this approach. Criticisms of Kant were common in the realist views of the new positivism at that time. Arthur Schopenhauer was strongly influenced by Kant&#x27;s transcendental idealism. Like G. E. Schulze, Jacobi, and Fichte before him, Schopenhauer was critical of Kant&#x27;s theory of the thing-in-itself. Things-in-themselves, they argued, are neither the cause of what we observe, nor are they completely beyond our access. Ever since the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, philosophers have been critical of Kant&#x27;s theory of the thing-in-itself. Many have argued that, if such a thing exists beyond experience, then one cannot posit that it affects us causally, since that would entail stretching the category &quot;causality&quot; beyond the realm of experience.
With the success and wide influence of Hegel&#x27;s writings, Kant&#x27;s own influence began to wane, but a re-examination of his ideas began in Germany in 1865 with the publication of &quot;Kant und die Epigonen&quot; by Otto Liebmann, whose motto was &quot;Back to Kant&quot;. There proceeded an important revival of Kant&#x27;s theoretical philosophy, known as Neo-Kantianism. Kant&#x27;s notion of &quot;critique&quot; has been more broadly influential. The early German Romantics, especially Friedrich Schlegel in his &quot;Athenaeum Fragments&quot;, used Kant&#x27;s reflexive conception of criticism in their Romantic theory of poetry. Also in aesthetics, Clement Greenberg, in his classic essay &quot;Modernist Painting&quot;, uses Kantian criticism, what Greenberg refers to as &quot;immanent criticism&quot;, to justify the aims of abstract painting, a movement Greenberg saw as aware of the key limitation—flatness—that makes up the medium of painting. French philosopher Michel Foucault was also greatly influenced by Kant&#x27;s notion of &quot;critique&quot; and wrote several pieces on Kant for a re-thinking of the Enlightenment as a form of &quot;critical thought&quot;. He went so far as to classify his own philosophy as a &quot;critical history of modernity, rooted in Kant&quot;.

Kant believed that mathematical truths were forms of synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge, which means they are necessary and universal, yet known through the &quot;a priori&quot; intuition of space and time, as transcendental preconditions of experience. Kant&#x27;s often brief remarks about mathematics influenced the mathematical school known as intuitionism, a movement in philosophy of mathematics opposed to Hilbert&#x27;s formalism, and Frege and Bertrand Russell&#x27;s logicism.

===Influence on modern thinkers===
With his &quot;Perpetual Peace&quot;, Kant is considered to have foreshadowed many of the ideas that have come to form the democratic peace theory, one of the main controversies in political science. More concretely, constructivist theorist Alexander Wendt proposed that the anarchy of the international system could evolve from the &quot;brutish&quot; Hobbesian anarchy understood by realist theorists, through Lockean anarchy, and ultimately a Kantian anarchy in which states would see their self-interests as inextricably linked to the well being of other states, thus transforming international politics into a far more peaceful form.

Prominent recent Kantians include the British philosophers P. F. Strawson, Onora O&#x27;Neill, and Quassim Cassam, and the American philosophers Wilfrid Sellars and Christine Korsgaard. Due to the influence of Strawson and Sellars, among others, there has been a renewed interest in Kant&#x27;s view of the mind. Central to many debates in philosophy of psychology and cognitive science is Kant&#x27;s conception of the unity of consciousness.

Jürgen Habermas and John Rawls are two significant political and moral philosophers whose work is strongly influenced by Kant&#x27;s moral philosophy. They have argued against relativism, supporting the Kantian view that universality is essential to any viable moral philosophy. Mou Zongsan&#x27;s study of Kant has been cited as a highly crucial part in the development of Mou&#x27;s personal philosophy, namely New Confucianism. Widely regarded as the most influential Kant scholar in China, Mou&#x27;s rigorous critique of Kant&#x27;s philosophyhaving translated all three of Kant&#x27;s critiquesserved as an ardent attempt to reconcile Chinese and Western philosophy whilst increasing pressure to Westernize in China.

Because of the thoroughness of Kant&#x27;s paradigm shift, his influence extends well beyond this to thinkers who neither specifically refer to his work nor use his terminology. Kant&#x27;s influence extended to the social, behavioral, and physical sciencesas in the sociology of Max Weber, the psychology of Jean Piaget, and Carl Gustav Jung. Kant&#x27;s work on mathematics and synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge is also cited by theoretical physicist Albert Einstein as an early influence on his intellectual development, although it was one which he later criticized and rejected. In the 2020s, there was a renewed interest in Kant&#x27;s theory of mind from the point of view of formal logic and computer science.

<doc id="14643" wikidata="Q331596" url="?curid=14643" title="History of Indonesia">
<text>The history of Indonesia has been shaped by its geographic position, natural resources, a series of human migrations and contacts, wars and conquests, as well as by trade, economics and politics. Indonesia is an archipelagic country of 17,000 to 18,000 islands stretching along the equator in Southeast Asia and Oceania. The country&#x27;s strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade; trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history. The area of Indonesia is populated by peoples of various migrations, creating a diversity of cultures, ethnicities, and languages. The archipelago&#x27;s landforms and climate significantly influenced agriculture and trade, and the formation of states. The boundaries of the state of Indonesia match the 20th-century borders of the Dutch East Indies.

Fossilised remains of &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, popularly known as &quot;Java Man&quot;, and their tools suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited at least 1.5 million years ago. Austronesian people, who form the majority of the modern population, are thought to have originally been from Taiwan and arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE. From the 7th century CE, the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished, bringing Hindu and Buddhist influences with it. The agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties subsequently thrived in inland Java. The last significant non-Muslim kingdom, the Hindu Majapahit kingdom, flourished from the late 13th century, and its influence stretched over much of Indonesia. The earliest evidence of Islamised populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra; other Indonesian areas gradually adopted Islam, which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century. For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences.

Europeans such as the Portuguese arrived in Indonesia from the 16th century seeking to monopolise the sources of valuable nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in Maluku. In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (&quot;Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie&quot; or VOC) and became the dominant European power by 1610. Following bankruptcy, the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800, and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies under government control. By the early 20th century, Dutch dominance extended to the current boundaries. The Japanese invasion and occupation in 1942–1945 during WWII ended Dutch rule, and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement. Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, nationalist leader Sukarno declared independence and became president. The Netherlands tried to reestablish its rule, but a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949, when in the face of international pressure the Dutch formally recognised Indonesian independence.

An attempted coup in 1965 led to a violent army-led anti-communist purge in which over half a million people were killed. General Suharto politically outmanoeuvred President Sukarno, and became president in March 1968. His New Order administration was marked by widespread corruption, nepotism, human rights abuses, and the centralization of power, with political dissent brutally suppressed and the media tightly controlled. Economic policies disproportionately benefited elites, while poverty and inequality persisted for much of his rule. In the late 1990s, Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis, which led to popular protests and Suharto&#x27;s resignation on 21 May 1998. The &quot;Reformasi&quot; era following Suharto&#x27;s resignation has led to a strengthening of democratic processes, including a regional autonomy program, the secession of East Timor, and the first direct presidential election in 2004. Political instability, social unrest, corruption, natural disasters, and terrorism remained problems in the 2000s, but the economy has performed strongly since 2007. Although relations between different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious, acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas.

Today, Indonesia, a nation with over 270 million people, is known for its diversity and multiculturalism, rooted in its rich history. Despite facing challenges such as political instability and economic crises, Indonesia has continued to develop its economy and plays a significant role in the Southeast Asian region. The country has also made notable contributions to global art, music, and cuisine.

==Prehistory==
In 2007, an analysis of cut marks on two bovid bones found in Sangiran, showed them to have been made 1.5 to 1.6 million years ago by clamshell tools. This is the oldest evidence for the presence of early humans in Indonesia. Fossilised remains of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; in Indonesia, popularly known as the &quot;Java Man&quot; were first discovered by the Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois at Trinil in 1891, and are at least 700,000 years old. Other &quot;H. erectus&quot; fossils of a similar age were found at Sangiran in the 1930s by the anthropologist Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald, who in the same time period also uncovered fossils at Ngandong alongside more advanced tools, re-dated in 2011 to between 550,000 and 143,000 years old. In 1977 another &quot;H. erectus&quot; skull was discovered at Sambungmacan. In 2010, stone tools were discovered on Flores, dating from 1 million years ago. These are the earliest remains implying human seafaring technology. The earliest evidence of artistic activity ever found, in the form of diagonal etchings made with the use of a shark&#x27;s tooth, was detected in 2014 on a 500,000-year-old fossil of a clam found in Java in the 1890s, associated with &quot;H. erectus&quot;.

In 2003, on the island of Flores, fossils of a 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall hominid dated between 74,000 and 13,000 years old were discovered, much to the surprise of the scientific community. This newly discovered hominid was named the &quot;Flores Man&quot;, or &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot;. A phylogenetic analysis published in 2017 suggests that &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; was descended from the same ancestor as &quot;Homo habilis.&quot; &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; would thus represent a previously unknown and very early migration out of Africa. The &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot; skeletal material is dated from 60,000 to 100,000 years ago; stone tools recovered alongside the skeletal remains were from archaeological horizons ranging from 50,000 to 190,000 years ago.
The Indonesian archipelago was formed during the thaw after the Last Glacial Maximum. Early humans travelled by sea and spread from mainland Asia eastward to New Guinea and Australia. &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; reached the region by around 45,000 years ago. In 2011, evidence was uncovered in neighbouring East Timor, showing that 42,000 years ago, these early settlers had high-level maritime skills, and by implication the technology needed to make ocean crossings to reach Australia and other islands, as they were catching and consuming large numbers of big deep sea fish such as tuna.

In November 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the then-oldest known figurative art painting, over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh on the Indonesian island of Borneo. The discovery of the cave paintings is important within human cultural history, as it adds to the view that cave art was created simultaneously in Indonesia and Europe. Francesco d&#x27;Errico, an expert in prehistoric art at the University of Bordeaux, described the investigation as a &quot;major archaeological discovery&quot;. On 11 December 2019, a team of researchers led by Dr. Maxime Aubert announced the discovery of the oldest hunting scenes in prehistoric art in the world which is more than 44,000 years old from the limestone cave of Leang Bulu&#x27; Sipong 4. Archaeologists determined the age of the depiction of hunting a pig and buffalo thanks to the calcite &#x27;popcorn&#x27;, different isotope levels of radioactive uranium and thorium. 

An elaborate 4.5 m long rock art panel in a limestone cave at Leang Bulu&#x27; in Sulawesi is currently considered the earliest figurative artwork in the world. It portrays several figures hunting wild pigs and dwarf bovids. This rock art was dated to at least 43,900 years ago on the basis of uranium-series analysis of overlying speleothems. A painted hand stencil from Leang Timpuseng, which has a minimum age of 39,900 years, is now the oldest known hand stencil in the world. Discoveries in 2021 revealed that another cave, Leang Tedongnge, has cave art with a minimum age of 45,500 years old, which makes it the earliest known representational work of art in the world. On July 3, 2024, the journal &quot;Nature&quot; published research findings indicating that the cave paintings which depict anthropomorphic figures interacting with a pig and measure in Leang Karampuang are approximately 51,200 years old, establishing them as the oldest known paintings in the world.

Austronesian people form the majority of the modern population. They may have arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE and are thought to have originated in Taiwan. During this period, parts of Indonesia participated in the Maritime Jade Road, with outlets in Kalimantan which existed for 3,000 years between 2000 BCE to 1000 CE. Dong Son culture spread to Indonesia bringing with it techniques of wet-field rice cultivation, ritual buffalo sacrifice, bronze casting, megalithic practises, and ikat weaving methods. Some of these practices remain in areas including the Batak areas of Sumatra, Toraja in Sulawesi, and several islands in Nusa Tenggara. Early Indonesians were animists who honoured the spirits of the dead believing their souls or life force could still help the living.

Ideal agricultural conditions, and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the 8th century BCE, allowed villages, towns, and small kingdoms to flourish by the 1st century CE. These kingdoms (little more than collections of villages subservient to petty chieftains) evolved with their own ethnic and tribal religions. Java&#x27;s hot and even temperature, abundant rain and volcanic soil, was perfect for wet rice cultivation. Such agriculture required a well-organized society, in contrast to the society based on dry-field rice, which is a much simpler form of cultivation that does not require an elaborate social structure to support it.

Buni culture clay pottery flourished in coastal northern West Java and Banten around 400 BCE to 100 CE. The Buni culture was probably the predecessor of the Tarumanagara kingdom, one of the earliest Hindu kingdoms in Indonesia, producing numerous inscriptions and marking the beginning of the historical period in Java.

==Hindu-Buddhist civilizations==
===Early kingdoms===
Much of Indonesia, like much of Southeast Asia, were influenced by Indian culture. From the 2nd century, through the Indian dynasties like the Pallava, Gupta, Pala and Chola in the succeeding centuries up to the 12th century, Indian culture spread across all of Southeast Asia.

References to the Dvipantara or Yawadvipa, a Hindu kingdom in Java and Sumatra appear in Sanskrit writings from 200 BCE. In India&#x27;s earliest epic, the Ramayana, Sugriva, the chief of Rama&#x27;s army dispatched his men to Yawadvipa, the island of Java, in search of Sita. According to the ancient Tamil text Manimekalai Java had a kingdom with a capital called Nagapuram. The earliest archaeological relic discovered in Indonesia is from the Ujung Kulon National Park, West Java, where an early Hindu statue of Ganesha estimated from the 1st century CE was found on the summit of Mount Raksa in Panaitan island. There is also archaeological evidence of Sunda Kingdom in West Java dating from the 2nd-century, and Jiwa Temple in Batujaya, Karawang, West Java was probably built around this time. South Indian culture was spread to Southeast Asia by the south Indian Pallava dynasty in the 4th and 5th centuries. and by the 5th century, stone inscriptions written in Pallava scripts were found in Java and Borneo.

A number of Hindu and Buddhist states flourished and then declined across Indonesia. Seven rough plinths dating from the beginning of the 4th century CE were found in Kutai, East Kalimantan, near the Mahakam River known as the Yupa inscription or &quot;Mulavarman Inscription&quot; believed to be one of the earliest Sanskrit inscriptions of Indonesia, the plinths were written by Brahmins in the Sanskrit language using the Pallava script of India recalling of a generous king by the name of Mulavarman who donated a huge amount of alms to Brahmin priests in his kingdom, the kingdom was known as the Kutai Martadipura Kingdom located in present East Kalimantan Province, believed to be the oldest and first Hindu kingdom of Indonesia.

===Tarumanagara and Sunda===
One such early kingdom was Tarumanagara, which flourished between 358 and 669 CE. Located in West Java close to modern-day Jakarta, its 5th-century king, Purnawarman, established the earliest known inscriptions in Java, the Ciaruteun inscription located near Bogor. And other inscriptions called the Pasir Awi inscription and the Muncul inscription. On this monument, King Purnawarman inscribed his name and made an imprint of his footprints, as well as his elephant&#x27;s footprints. The accompanying inscription reads, &quot;Here are the footprints of King Purnavarman, the heroic conqueror of the world&quot;. This inscription is written in Pallava script and in Sanskrit and is still clear after 1500 years. Purnawarman apparently built a canal that changed the course of the Cakung River, and drained a coastal area for agriculture and settlement purpose. In his stone inscriptions, Purnawarman associated himself with Vishnu, and Brahmins ritually secured the hydraulic project.

Around the same period, in the 6th to 7th centuries (501–700 CE), the Kalingga Kingdom was established in Central Java northern coast, mentioned in Chinese account. The name of this kingdom was derived from ancient Indian kingdom of Kalinga, which suggest the ancient link between India and Indonesia.

The political history of Indonesian archipelago during the 7th to 11th (601–1100 CE) around centuries was dominated by Srivijaya based in Sumatra and Sailendra that dominated southeast Asia based in Java and constructed Borobudur, the largest Buddhist monument in the world. The history prior of the 14th and 15th centuries (1301–1500 CE) is not well known due to the scarcity of evidence. By the 15th century (1401–1500 CE), two major states dominated this period; Majapahit in East Java, the greatest of the pre-Islamic Indonesian states, and Malacca on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula, arguably one of the greatest of the Muslim trading empires, this marked the rise of Muslim states in the Indonesian archipelago.

===Mataram===

Mataram Empire, sometimes referred to as Mataram Kingdom, was an Indianized kingdom based in Central Java around modern-day Yogyakarta between the 8th and 10th centuries. The kingdom was ruled by the Sailendra dynasty, and later by the Sanjaya dynasty. The centre of the kingdom was moved from central Java to East Java by Mpu Sindok. An eruption of the volcano Mount Merapi in 929, and political pressure from Sailendrans based in the Srivijaya Empire may have caused the move.

The first king of Mataram, Sri Sanjaya, left inscriptions in stone. The monumental Hindu temple of Prambanan in the vicinity of Yogyakarta was built by Pikatan. Dharmawangsa ordered the translation of the Mahabharata into Old Javanese in 996.

In the period 750 CE – 850 CE, the kingdom saw the blossoming of classical Javanese art and architecture. A rapid increase in temple construction occurred across the landscape of its heartland in Mataram (Kedu and Kewu Plain). The most notable temples constructed in Mataram are Kalasan, Sewu, Borobudur and Prambanan. The Empire had become the supreme power not only in Java but also over Srivijayan Empire, Bali, southern Thailand, some Philippine kingdoms, and Khmer in Cambodia.

Later in its history, the dynasty divided into two dynasties based on their own religion, the Buddhist and Shivaist dynasties. Civil war was unavoidable and the outcome was Mataram Empire divided into two powerful kingdom based on region and religion. The Shivaist dynasty of Mataram kingdom in Java led by Rakai Pikatan and the Buddhist dynasty of Srivijaya kingdom in Sumatra led by Balaputradewa. The hostility between them didn&#x27;t end until in 1006 when the Sailendran based in Srivijaya kingdom incited rebellion by Wurawari, vassal of Mataram kingdom and sacked Shivaist dynasty&#x27;s capital in Watugaluh, Java. Srivijaya kingdom rose into undisputed hegemonic Empire in the era as the result. Yet the Shivaist dynasty survived and successfully reclaimed the east Java in 1019 then descended to Kahuripan kingdom led by Airlangga son of Udayana of Bali.

===Srivijaya===
Srivijaya was a kingdom on Sumatra which influenced much of the Maritime Southeast Asia. From the 7th century, the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it.

Srivijaya was centred in the coastal trading centre of present-day Palembang. Srivijaya was not a &quot;state&quot; in the modern sense with defined boundaries and a centralised government to which the citizens own allegiance. Rather Srivijaya was a confederacy form of society centred on a royal heartland. It was a thalassocracy and did not extend its influence far beyond the coastal areas of the islands of Southeast Asia. Trade was the driving force of Srivijaya just as it is for most societies throughout history. The Srivijayan navy controlled the trade that made its way through the Strait of Malacca.

By the 7th century, the harbours of various vassal states of Srivijaya lined both coasts of the Straits of Melaka. Around this time, Srivijaya had established suzerainty over large areas of Sumatra, western Java, and much of the Malay Peninsula. Dominating the Malacca and Sunda straits, the empire controlled both the Spice Route traffic and local trade. It remained a formidable sea power until the 13th century. This spread the ethnic Malay culture throughout Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and western Borneo. A stronghold of Mahayana Buddhism, Srivijaya attracted pilgrims and scholars from other parts of Asia.

The relation between Srivijaya and the Chola Empire of south India was friendly during the reign of Raja Raja Chola I but during the reign of Rajendra Chola I the Chola Empire attacked Srivijaya cities. A series of Chola raids in the 11th century weakened the Srivijayan hegemony and enabled the formation of regional kingdoms based, like Kediri, on intensive agriculture rather than coastal and long-distance trade. Srivijayan influence waned by the 11th century. The island was in frequent conflict with the Javanese kingdoms, first Singhasari and then Majapahit. Islam eventually made its way to the Aceh region of Sumatra, spreading its influence through contacts with Arabs and Indian traders. By the late 13th century, the kingdom of Pasai in northern Sumatra converted to Islam. The last inscription dates to 1374, where a crown prince, Ananggavarman, is mentioned. Srivijaya ceased to exist by 1414, when Parameswara, the kingdom&#x27;s last prince, fled to Temasik, then to Malacca. Later his son converted to Islam and founded the Sultanate of Malacca on the Malay peninsula.

===Singhasari and Majapahit===


Majapahit was the most dominant of Indonesia&#x27;s pre-Islamic states. The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century, and under Gajah Mada it experienced what is often referred to as a golden age in Indonesian history, when its influence extended to much of southern Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, and Bali from about 1293 to around 1500.

The founder of the Majapahit Empire, Kertarajasa, was the son-in-law of the ruler of the Singhasari kingdom, also based in Java. After Singhasari drove Srivijaya out of Java in 1290, the rising power of Singhasari came to the attention of Kublai Khan in China and he sent emissaries demanding tribute. Kertanagara, ruler of the Singhasari kingdom, refused to pay tribute and the Khan sent a punitive expedition which arrived off the coast of Java in 1293. By that time, a rebel from Kediri, Jayakatwang, had killed Kertanagara. The Majapahit founder allied himself with the Mongols against Jayakatwang and, once the Singhasari kingdom was destroyed, turned and forced his Mongol allies to withdraw in confusion.

Gajah Mada, a Majapahit prime minister and regent from 1331 to 1364, extended the empire&#x27;s rule to the surrounding islands. A few years after Gajah Mada&#x27;s death, the Majapahit navy captured Palembang, putting an end to the Sriwijaya kingdom. Although the Majapahit rulers extended their power over other islands and destroyed neighbouring kingdoms, their focus seems to have been on controlling and gaining a larger share of the commercial trade that passed through the archipelago. About the time Majapahit was founded, Muslim traders and proselytisers began entering the area. After its peak in the 14th century, Majapahit power began to decline and was unable to control the rising power of the Sultanate of Malacca. Dates for the end of the Majapahit Empire range from 1478 to 1520. A large number of courtiers, artisans, priests, and members of the royal family moved east to the island of Bali at the end of Majapahit power.

==Islamic civilizations==
===Spread of Islam===

The earliest accounts of the Indonesian archipelago date from the Abbasid Caliphate, according to those early accounts the Indonesian archipelago were famous among early Muslim sailors mainly due to its abundance of precious spice trade commodities such as nutmeg, cloves, galangal and many other spices.

Although Muslim traders first travelled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era, the spread of Islam among the inhabitants of the Indonesian archipelago dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra.

Although it is known that the spread of Islam began in the west of the archipelago, the fragmentary evidence does not suggest a rolling wave of conversion through adjacent areas; rather, it suggests the process was complicated and slow. The spread of Islam was driven by increasing trade links outside of the archipelago; in general, traders and the royalty of major kingdoms were the first to adopt the new religion.

Other Indonesian areas gradually adopted Islam, making it the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 7th until 13th century. For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences, which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia, particularly in Java. Only Bali retained a Hindu majority. In the eastern archipelago, both Christian and Islamic missionaries were active in the 16th and 17th centuries, and, currently, there are large communities of both religions on these islands.

===Sultanate of Mataram===

The Sultanate of Mataram was the third Sultanate in Java, after the Sultanate of Demak Bintoro and the Sultanate of Pajang.

According to Javanese records, Kyai Gedhe Pamanahan became the ruler of the Mataram area in the 1570s with the support of the kingdom of Pajang to the east, near the current site of Surakarta (Solo). Pamanahan was often referred to as Kyai Gedhe Mataram after his ascension.

Pamanahan&#x27;s son, Panembahan Senapati, replaced his father on the throne around 1584. Under Senapati the kingdom grew substantially through regular military campaigns against Mataram&#x27;s neighbours. Shortly after his accession, for example, he conquered his father&#x27;s patrons in Pajang.

The reign of Panembahan Seda ing Krapyak (Suhusunan Anyakrawati) (&quot;c.&quot; 1601–1613), the son of Senapati, was dominated by further warfare, especially against powerful Surabaya, already a major centre in East Java. The first contact between Mataram and the Dutch East India Company (VOC) occurred under Krapyak. Dutch activities at the time were limited to trading from limited coastal settlements, so their interactions with the inland Mataram kingdom were limited, although they did form an alliance against Surabaya in 1613. Krapyak died that year.Krapyak was succeeded by his son, who is known simply as Sultan Agung (&quot;Great Sultan&quot;) in Javanese records. Agung was responsible for the great expansion and lasting historical legacy of Mataram due to the extensive military conquests of his long reign from 1613 to 1646.

===Sultanate of Banten===
In 1524–25, Sunan Gunung Jati from Cirebon, together with the armies of Demak Sultanate, seized the port of Banten from the Sunda kingdom, and established The Sultanate of Banten. This was accompanied by Muslim preachers and the adoption of Islam amongst the local population. At its peak in the first half of the 17th century, the Sultanate lasted from 1526 to 1813 AD. The Sultanate left many archaeological remains and historical records.

==European colonization==
Beginning in the 16th century, successive waves of Europeans—the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and English—sought to dominate the spice trade at its sources in India and the &#x27;Spice Islands&#x27; (Maluku) of Indonesia. This meant finding a way to Asia to cut out Muslim merchants who, with their Venetian outlet in the Mediterranean, monopolised spice imports to Europe. Astronomically priced at the time, spices were highly coveted not only to preserve and make poorly preserved meat palatable, but also as medicines and magic potions.

The arrival of Europeans in South East Asia is often regarded as the watershed moment in its history. Other scholars consider this view untenable, arguing that European influence during the times of the early arrivals of the 16th and 17th centuries was limited in both area and depth. This is in part due to Europe not being the most advanced or dynamic area of the world in the early 15th century. Rather, the major expansionist force of this time was Islam; in 1453, for example, the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople, while Islam continued to spread through Indonesia and the Philippines. European influence, particularly that of the Dutch, would not have its greatest impact on Indonesia until the 18th and 19th centuries.

===The Portuguese===

Newfound Portuguese expertise in navigation, shipbuilding and weaponry allowed them to make daring expeditions of exploration and expansion. Starting with the first exploratory expeditions sent from newly conquered Malacca in 1512, the Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive in Indonesia, and sought to dominate the sources of valuable spices and to extend the Catholic Church&#x27;s missionary efforts. The Portuguese turned east to Maluku and through both military conquest and alliance with local rulers, they established trading posts, forts, and missions on the islands of Ternate, Ambon, and Solor among others. The height of Portuguese missionary activities, however, came in the latter half of the 16th century. Ultimately, the Portuguese presence in Indonesia was reduced to Solor, Flores and Timor in modern-day Nusa Tenggara, following defeat at the hands of indigenous Ternateans and the Dutch in Maluku, and a general failure to maintain control of trade in the region. In comparison with the original Portuguese ambition to dominate Asian trade, their influence on Indonesian culture was small: the romantic &quot;keroncong&quot; guitar ballads; a number of Indonesian words which reflect Portuguese&#x27;s role as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the archipelago alongside Malay; and many family names in eastern Indonesia such as da Costa, Dias, de Fretes, Gonsalves, etc. The most significant impacts of the Portuguese arrival were the disruption and disorganisation of the trade network mostly as a result of their conquest of Malacca, and the first significant plantings of Christianity in Indonesia. There have continued to be Christian communities in eastern Indonesia through to the present, which has contributed to a sense of shared interest with Europeans, particularly among the Ambonese.

===Dutch East India Company===

In 1602, the Dutch parliament awarded the VOC a monopoly on trade and colonial activities in the region at a time before the company controlled any territory in Java. In 1619, the VOC conquered the West Javan city of Jayakarta, where they founded the city of Batavia (present-day Jakarta). The VOC became deeply involved in the internal politics of Java in this period, and fought in a number of wars involving the leaders of Mataram and Banten.

The Dutch followed the Portuguese aspirations, courage, brutality, and strategies but brought better organisation, weapons, ships, and superior financial backing. Although they failed to gain complete control of the Indonesian spice trade, they had much more success than the previous Portuguese efforts. They exploited the factionalisation of the small kingdoms in Java that had replaced Majapahit, establishing a permanent foothold in Java, from which grew a land-based colonial empire which became one of the richest colonial possessions on earth.

By the mid-17th century, Batavia, the headquarter of VOC in Asia, had become an important trade centre in the region. It had repelled attacks from the Javanese Mataram kingdom. In 1641, the Dutch captured Malacca from the Portuguese, thus weakened Portuguese position in Asia. The Dutch defeated the Sulawesi city of Makassar in 1667 thus bringing its trade under VOC control. Sumatran ports were also brought under VOC control and the last of the Portuguese were expelled in 1660. In return for monopoly control over the pepper trade and the expulsion of the English, the Dutch helped the son of the ruler of Banten overthrow his father in 1680. By the 18th century, the VOC has established themselves firmly in Indonesian archipelago, controlling inter-island trade as part of their Asian business which includes India, Ceylon, Formosa, and Japan. VOC has established their important bases in some ports in Java, Maluku, and parts of Sulawesi, Sumatra, and Malay Peninsula.

===French and British interlude===

After the fall of the Netherlands to the First French Empire and the dissolution of the Dutch East India Company in 1800, there were profound changes in the European colonial administration of the East Indies. The company&#x27;s assets in East Indies were nationalised as the Dutch colony, the Dutch East Indies. Meanwhile, Europe was devastated by the Napoleonic Wars. In the Netherlands, Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806 oversaw the dissolution of the Batavian Republic, which was replaced by the Kingdom of Holland, a French puppet kingdom ruled by Napoleon&#x27;s third brother Louis Bonaparte (Lodewijk Napoleon). The East Indies were treated as a proxy French colony, administered through a Dutch intermediary.

In 1806, King Lodewijk of the Netherlands sent one of his generals, Herman Willem Daendels, to serve as governor-general of the East Indies, based in Java. Daendels was sent to strengthen Javanese defences against a predicted British invasion. Since 1685, the British had had a presence in Bencoolen on the western coast of Sumatra, as well as several posts north of the Malaccan straits. Daendels was responsible for the construction of the Great Post Road () across northern Java from Anjer to Panaroecan. The thousand-kilometre road was meant as to ease logistics across Java and was completed in only one year, during which thousands of Javanese forced labourers died. In 1811, Java was captured by the British, becoming a possession of the British Empire, and Thomas Stamford Raffles was appointed as the island&#x27;s governor. Raffles launched several military expeditions against local Javanese princes; such as the assault on Yogyakarta kraton on 21 June 1812, and the military expedition against Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II of Palembang, along with giving orders to seize the nearby Bangka Island. During his administration, numbers of ancient monuments in Java were rediscovered, excavated and systematically catalogued for the first time, the most important one being the rediscovery of Borobudur Buddhist temple in Central Java. Raffles was an enthusiast of the island&#x27;s history, as he wrote the book &quot;The History of Java&quot; published later in 1817. In 1816, under the administration of British governor John Fendall, Java was returned to control of the Netherlands as per the terms of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814.

===Dutch state rule===

After the VOC was dissolved in 1800 following bankruptcy, and after the end of British rule under Raffles&#x27; governorship, the Dutch state took over the VOC possessions in 1816. A Javanese uprising was crushed in the Java War of 1825–1830. After 1830, a system of forced cultivations and indentured labour was introduced on Java, the Cultivation System (in Dutch: &quot;cultuurstelsel&quot;). This system brought the Dutch and their Indonesian allies enormous wealth. The cultivation system tied peasants to their land, forcing them to work in government-owned plantations for 60 days of the year. The system was abolished in a more liberal period after 1870. In 1901, the Dutch adopted what they called the Ethical Policy, which included somewhat increased investment in indigenous education, and modest political reforms.

The Dutch colonials formed a privileged upper social class of soldiers, administrators, managers, teachers, and pioneers. They lived together with the &quot;natives&quot;, but at the top of a rigid social and racial caste system. The Dutch East Indies had two legal classes of citizens; European and indigenous. A third class, Foreign Easterners, was added in 1920.

Upgrading the infrastructure of ports and roads was a high priority for the Dutch, with the goal of modernising the economy, pumping wages into local areas, facilitating commerce, and speeding up military movements. By 1950, Dutch engineers had built and upgraded a road network with 12,000 km of asphalted surface, 41,000 km of metalled road area and 16,000 km of gravel surfaces. In addition the Dutch built of railways, bridges, irrigation systems covering 1.4 million hectares (5,400 sq mi) of rice fields, several harbours, and 140 public drinking water systems. These Dutch constructed public works became the economic base of the colonial state; after independence, they became the basis of the Indonesian infrastructure.

For most of the colonial period, Dutch control over its territories in the Indonesian archipelago was tenuous. In some cases, Dutch police and military actions in parts of Indonesia were quite cruel. Recent discussions, for example, of Dutch cruelty in Aceh have encouraged renewed research on these aspects of Dutch rule. It was only in the early 20th century, three centuries after the first Dutch trading post, that the full extent of the colonial territory was established and direct colonial rule exerted across what would become the boundaries of the modern Indonesian state. Portuguese Timor, now East Timor, remained under Portuguese rule until 1975 when it was invaded by Indonesia. The Indonesian government declared the territory an Indonesian province but relinquished it in 1999.

==Emergence of Indonesia==
===Indonesian National Awakening===

In October 1908, the first nationalist movement was formed, Budi Utomo. On 10 September 1912, the first nationalist mass movement was formed: Sarekat Islam. By December 1912, Sarekat Islam had 93,000 members. The Dutch responded after the First World War with repressive measures. The nationalist leaders came from a small group of young professionals and students, some of whom had been educated in the Netherlands. In the post–World War I era, the Indonesian communists who were associated with the Third International started to usurp the nationalist movement. The repression of the nationalist movement led to many arrests, including Indonesia&#x27;s first president, Sukarno (1901–70), who was imprisoned for political activities on 29 December 1929. Also arrested was Mohammad Hatta, first vice-president of Indonesia. Additionally, Sutan Sjahrir, who later became the first Prime Minister of Indonesia, was arrested on this date.

In 1914 the exiled Dutch socialist Henk Sneevliet founded the Indies Social Democratic Association. Initially a small forum of Dutch socialists, it would later evolve into the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) in 1924. In the post–World War I era, the Dutch strongly repressed all attempts at change. This repression led to a growth of the PKI. By December 1924, the PKI had a membership of 1,140. One year later in 1925, the PKI had grown to 3,000 members. From 1926 to 1927, there was a PKI-led revolt against Dutch colonialism and the harsh repression of strikes of urban workers. However, the strikes and the revolt was put down by the Dutch with some 13,000 nationalists and communists leaders were arrested. Some 4,500 were given prison sentences.

Sukarno was released from prison in December 1931 but was re-arrested on 1 August 1933.

===Japanese occupation===

The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during World War II interrupted Dutch rule and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement. In May 1940, early in World War II, Nazi Germany occupied the Netherlands, but the Dutch government-in-exile initially continued to control the Dutch East Indies from its base in London. The Dutch East Indies declared a state of siege and in July 1940 redirected exports intended for Japan to the US and Britain. Negotiations with the Japanese aimed at securing supplies of aviation fuel collapsed in June 1941, and the Japanese started their conquest of Southeast Asia in December of that year. That same month, factions from Sumatra sought Japanese assistance for a revolt against the Dutch wartime government. The Japanese military defeated last Dutch forces in the East Indies in March 1942.

In July 1942, Sukarno accepted Japan&#x27;s offer to rally the public in support of the Japanese war effort. Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta were decorated by the Emperor of Japan in 1943. However, experience of the Japanese occupation of Dutch East Indies varied considerably, depending upon where one lived and one&#x27;s social position. Many who lived in areas considered important to the war effort experienced torture, sex slavery, arbitrary arrest and execution, and other war crimes. Thousands taken away from Indonesia as war labourers (romusha) suffered or died as a result of ill-treatment and starvation. People of Dutch and mixed Dutch-Indonesian descent were particular targets of the Japanese occupation.

In March 1945, the Japanese established the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (BPUPK) as the initial stage of the establishment of independence for the area under the control of the Japanese 16th Army. At its first meeting in May, Soepomo spoke of national integration and against personal individualism, while Muhammad Yamin suggested that the new nation should claim British Borneo, British Malaya, Portuguese Timor, and all the pre-war territories of the Dutch East Indies. The committee drafted the 1945 Constitution, which remains in force, though now much amended. On 9 August 1945 Sukarno, Hatta, and Radjiman Wediodiningrat were flown to meet Marshal Hisaichi Terauchi in Vietnam. They were told that Japan intended to announce Indonesian independence on 24 August. After the Japanese surrender, however, Sukarno unilaterally proclaimed Indonesian independence on 17 August. A later UN report stated that four million people died in Indonesia as a result of the Japanese occupation.

===Indonesian National Revolution===

Under pressure from radical and politicised &quot;pemuda&quot; (&#x27;youth&#x27;) groups, Sukarno and Hatta on behalf of the Nation proclaimed Indonesian independence on 17 August 1945 from colonialism by foreign nations two days after the Japanese Emperor&#x27;s surrender in the Pacific, and made this nation an independent state, which has the right to govern its people and nation in accordance with the philosophy, character and spirit of the Indonesia nation itself. The following day, the Central Indonesian National Committee (KNIP) declared Sukarno President and Hatta Vice-President. Word of the proclamation spread by shortwave and fliers while the Indonesian war-time military (PETA), youths, and others rallied in support of the new republic, often moving to take over government offices from the Japanese. In December 1946 the United Nations acknowledged that Netherlands had advised the United Nations that the &quot;Netherlands Indies&quot; was a non-self-governing territory (colony) for which the Netherlands had a legal duty to make yearly reports and to assist towards &quot;a full measure of self-government&quot; as required by the &quot;Charter of the United Nations article 73&quot;.

The Dutch, initially backed by the British, tried to re-establish their rule, and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949, when in the face of international pressure, the Dutch formally recognised Indonesian independence. Dutch efforts to re-establish complete control met resistance. At the end of World War II, a power vacuum arose, and the nationalists often succeeded in seizing the arms of the demoralised Japanese. A period of unrest with city guerrilla warfare called the Bersiap period ensued. Groups of Indonesian nationalists armed with improvised weapons (like bamboo spears) and firearms attacked returning Allied troops. 3,500 Europeans were killed and 20,000 were missing, meaning there were more European deaths in Indonesia after the war than during the war. After returning to Java, Dutch forces quickly re-occupied the colonial capital of Batavia (now Jakarta), so the city of Yogyakarta in central Java became the capital of the nationalist forces. Negotiations with the nationalists led to two major truce agreements, but disputes about their implementation, and much mutual provocation, led each time to renewed conflict. Within four years the Dutch had recaptured almost the whole of Indonesia, but guerrilla resistance persisted, led on Java by commander Nasution. On 27 December 1949, after four years of sporadic warfare and fierce criticism of the Dutch by the UN, the Netherlands officially recognised Indonesian sovereignty under the federal structure of the United States of Indonesia (RUSI). With the unification of all the kingdoms in the archipelago on 17 August 1950, exactly five years after the proclamation of independence, the last of the federal states were dissolved and Sukarno proclaimed a single unitary Republic of Indonesia until now.

==Sukarno&#x27;s presidency==
===Democratic experiment===

With the unifying struggle to secure Indonesia&#x27;s independence over, divisions in Indonesian society began to appear. These included regional differences in customs, religion, the impact of Christianity and Marxism, and fears of Javanese political domination. Following colonial rule, Japanese occupation, and war against the Dutch, the new country suffered from severe poverty, a ruinous economy, low educational and skills levels, and authoritarian traditions. Challenges to the authority of the Republic included the militant &quot;Darul Islam&quot; who waged a guerrilla struggle against the Republic from 1948 to 1962; the declaration of an independent Republic of South Maluku by Ambonese formerly of the Royal Dutch Indies Army; and rebellions in Sumatra and Sulawesi between 1955 and 1961.

In contrast to the 1945 Constitution, the 1950 constitution mandated a parliamentary system of government, an executive responsible to parliament, and stipulated at length constitutional guarantees for human rights, drawing heavily on the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. A proliferation of political parties dealing for shares of cabinet seats resulted in a rapid turnover of coalition governments including 17 cabinets between 1945 and 1958. The long-postponed parliamentary elections were held in 1955; although the Indonesian National Party (PNI)—considered Sukarno&#x27;s party—topped the poll, and the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) received strong support, no party garnered more than a quarter of the votes, which resulted in short-lived coalitions.

===Guided Democracy===

By 1956, Sukarno was openly criticising parliamentary democracy, stating that it was &quot;based upon inherent conflict&quot; which ran counter to Indonesian notions of harmony as being the natural state of human relationships. Instead, he sought a system based on the traditional village system of discussion and consensus, under the guidance of village elders. He proposed a threefold blend of &quot;nasionalisme&quot; (&#x27;nationalism&#x27;), &quot;agama&quot; (&#x27;religion&#x27;), and &quot;komunisme&quot; (&#x27;communism&#x27;) into a co-operative &#x27;Nas-A-Kom&#x27; government. This was intended to appease the three main factions in Indonesian politics — the army, Islamic groups, and the communists. With the support of the military, he proclaimed in February 1957 a system of &#x27;Guided Democracy&#x27;, and proposed a cabinet representing all the political parties of importance (including the PKI). The US tried and failed to secretly overthrow the president, even though Secretary of State Dulles declared before Congress that &quot;we are not interested in the internal affairs of this country.&quot;

Sukarno abrogated the 1950 Constitution on 9 July 1959 by a decree dissolving the Constitutional Assembly and restoring the 1945 Constitution. The elected parliament was replaced by one appointed by, and subject to the will of, the president. This dissolution of the constitutional assembly caused Sukarno to ban the Masyumi Party in August 1960. Another non-elected body, the Supreme Advisory Council, was the main policy development body, while the National Front was set up in September 1960 and presided over by the president to &quot;mobilise the revolutionary forces of the people&quot;. Western-style parliamentary democracy was thus finished in Indonesia until the 1999 elections of the &quot;Reformasi&quot; era.

===Sukarno&#x27;s revolution and nationalism===

Charismatic Sukarno spoke as a romantic revolutionary, and under his increasingly authoritarian rule, Indonesia moved on a course of stormy nationalism. Sukarno was popularly referred to as &quot;bung&quot; (&quot;older brother&quot;), and he painted himself as a man of the people carrying the aspirations of Indonesia and one who dared take on the West. He instigated a number of large, ideologically driven infrastructure projects and monuments celebrating Indonesia&#x27;s identity, which were criticised as substitutes for real development in a deteriorating economy.

Western New Guinea had been part of the Dutch East Indies, and Indonesian nationalists had thus claimed it on this basis. Indonesia was able to instigate a diplomatic and military confrontation with the Dutch over the territory following an Indonesian-Soviet arms agreement in 1960. It was, however, United States pressure on the Netherlands that led to an Indonesian takeover in 1963. Also in 1963, Indonesia commenced &quot;Konfrontasi&quot; with the new state of Malaysia. The northern states of Borneo, formerly British Sarawak and Sabah, had wavered in joining Malaysia, whilst Indonesia saw itself as the rightful ruler of Austronesian peoples and supported an unsuccessful revolution attempt in Brunei. Reviving the glories of the Indonesian National Revolution, Sukarno increased the anti-British sentiment in his rhetoric and mounted military offensives along the Indonesia-Malaysia border in Borneo. As the PKI rallied in Jakarta streets in support, the West became increasingly alarmed at Indonesian foreign policy and the United States withdrew its aid to Indonesia.

In social policy, Sukarno&#x27;s time in office witnessed substantial reforms in health and education, together with the passage of various pro-labour measures. However, Indonesia&#x27;s economic position deteriorated under Sukarno; by the mid-1960s, the cash-strapped government had to scrap critical public sector subsidies, inflation was at 1,000%, export revenues were shrinking, infrastructure crumbling, and factories were operating at minimal capacity with negligible investment. Severe poverty and hunger were widespread.

==New Order==

===Transition to the New Order===


Described as the great &quot;dalang&quot; (&quot;puppet master&quot;), Sukarno&#x27;s position depended on balancing the opposing and increasingly hostile forces of the army and the PKI. Sukarno&#x27;s anti-imperialist ideology saw Indonesia increasingly dependent on Soviet and then communist China. By 1965, the PKI was the largest communist party in the world outside the Soviet Union or China. Penetrating all levels of government, the party increasingly gained influence at the expense of the army.

On 30 September 1965, six of the most senior generals within the military and other officers were assassinated in an attempted coup. The insurgents, known later as the 30 September Movement, backed a rival faction of the army and took up positions in the capital, later seizing control of the national radio station. They claimed they were acting against a plot organised by the generals to overthrow Sukarno. Within a few hours, Major General Suharto, commander of the Army Strategic Reserve (Kostrad), mobilised counteraction, and by the evening of 1 October, it was clear that the coup, which had little co-ordination and was largely limited to Jakarta, had failed. Complicated and partisan theories continue to this day over the identity of the attempted coup&#x27;s organisers and their aims. According to the Indonesian army, the PKI were behind the coup and used disgruntled army officers to carry it out, and this became the official account of Suharto&#x27;s subsequent New Order administration. Although there is not broad agreement on who bears ultimate responsibility for the coup or even if there was really a single mastermind controlling all events, modern evidence has suggested at least a role played by Western intelligence agencies including the American Central Intelligence Agency and the United Kingdom&#x27;s MI6.

The PKI was blamed for the coup, and anti-communists, initially following the army&#x27;s lead, went on a violent anti-communist purge across much of the country. The PKI was effectively destroyed, and the most widely accepted estimates are that between 500,000 and 1 million were killed. The violence was especially brutal in Java and Bali. The PKI was outlawed and possibly more than 1 million of its leaders and affiliates were imprisoned. The United States and other Western powers facilitated and supported the purge.

Throughout the 1965–66 period, President Sukarno attempted to restore his political position and shift the country back to its pre-October 1965 position but his Guided Democracy balancing act was destroyed with the PKI&#x27;s demise. Although he remained president, the weakened Sukarno was forced to transfer key political and military powers to General Suharto, who by that time had become head of the armed forces. In March 1967, the Provisional People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPRS) named General Suharto acting president. Suharto was formally appointed president in March 1968. Sukarno lived under virtual house arrest until his death in 1970.

===Consolidation of the New Order===
In the aftermath of Suharto&#x27;s rise, hundreds of thousands of people were killed or imprisoned by the military and religious groups in a backlash against alleged communist supporters, with direct support from the United States. Suharto&#x27;s administration is commonly called the &quot;New Order&quot; era. Suharto invited major foreign investment, which produced substantial, if uneven, economic growth. However, Suharto enriched himself and his family through business dealings and widespread corruption.

===Annexation of West Irian===
At the time of independence, the Dutch retained control over the western half of New Guinea (also known as West Irian), and permitted steps towards self-government and a declaration of independence on 1 December 1961. After negotiations with the Dutch on the incorporation of the territory into Indonesia failed, an Indonesian paratroop invasion 18 December preceded armed clashes between Indonesian and Dutch troops in 1961 and 1962. In 1962 the United States pressured the Netherlands into secret talks with Indonesia which in August 1962 produced the New York Agreement, and Indonesia assumed administrative responsibility for West Irian on 1 May 1963.

Rejecting UN supervision, the Indonesian government under Suharto decided to settle the question of West Irian, the former Dutch New Guinea, in their favour. Rather than a referendum of all residents of West Irian as had been agreed under Sukarno, an &#x27;Act of Free Choice&#x27; was conducted in 1969 in which 1,025 Papuan representatives of local councils were selected by the Indonesians. They were warned to vote in favour of Indonesian integration with the group unanimously voting for integration with Indonesia. A subsequent UN General Assembly resolution confirmed the transfer of sovereignty to Indonesia.

West Irian was renamed Irian Jaya (&#x27;glorious Irian&#x27;) in 1973. Opposition to Indonesian administration of Irian Jaya (later known as Papua) gave rise to guerrilla activity in the years following Jakarta&#x27;s assumption of control.

===Annexation of East Timor===

In 1975, the Carnation Revolution in Portugal caused authorities there to announce plans for decolonisation of Portuguese Timor, the eastern half of the island of Timor whose western half was a part of the Indonesian province of East Nusa Tenggara. In the East Timorese elections held in 1975, Fretilin, a left-leaning party, and UDT, aligned with the local elite, emerged as the largest parties, having previously formed an alliance to campaign for independence from Portugal. Apodeti, a party advocating integration with Indonesia, enjoyed little popular support.

Indonesia alleged that Fretilin was communist, and feared that an independent East Timor would influence separatism in the archipelago. Indonesian military intelligence influenced the break-up of the alliance between Fretilin and UDT, which led to a coup by the UDT on 11 August 1975 and the start of a month-long civil war. During this time, the Portuguese government effectively abandoned the territory and did not resume the decolonisation process. On 28 November, Fretilin unilaterally declared independence, and proclaimed the &#x27;Democratic Republic of East Timor&#x27;. Nine days later, on 7 December, Indonesia invaded East Timor, eventually annexing the tiny country of (then) 680,000 people. Indonesia was supported materially and diplomatically by the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, who regarded Indonesia as an anti-communist ally.

Following the 1998 resignation of Suharto, the people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly for independence in a UN-sponsored referendum held on 30 August 1999. About 99% of the eligible population participated; more than three quarters chose independence despite months of attacks by the Indonesian military and its militia. After the result was announced, elements of the Indonesian military and its militia retaliated by killing approximately 2,000 East Timorese, displacing two-thirds of the population, raping hundreds of women and girls, and destroying much of the country&#x27;s infrastructure. In October 1999, the Indonesian parliament (MPR) revoked the decree that annexed East Timor, and the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) assumed responsibility for governing East Timor until it officially became an independent state in May 2002.

===Transmigration===
The Transmigration program (&quot;Transmigrasi&quot;) was a National Government initiative to move landless people from densely populated areas of Indonesia (such as Java and Bali) to less populous areas of the country including Papua, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi. The stated purpose of this program was to reduce the considerable poverty and overpopulation on Java, to provide opportunities for hard-working poor people, and to provide a workforce to better utilise the resources of the outer islands. The program, however, has been controversial, with critics accusing the Indonesian Government of trying to use these migrants to reduce the proportion of native populations in destination areas to weaken separatist movements. The program has often been cited as a major and ongoing factor in controversies and even conflict and violence between settlers and indigenous populations.

==Reform era==
===Pro-democracy movement===
In 1996, Suharto undertook efforts to pre-empt a challenge to the New Order government. The Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), a legal party that had traditionally propped up the regime, had changed direction and began to assert its independence. Suharto fostered a split over the leadership of PDI, backing a co-opted faction loyal to deputy speaker of the People&#x27;s Representative Council Suryadi against a faction loyal to Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Sukarno and the PDI&#x27;s chairperson.

After the Suryadi faction announced a party congress to sack Megawati would be held in Medan on 20–22 June, Megawati proclaimed that her supporters would hold demonstrations in protest. The Suryadi faction went through with its sacking of Megawati, and the demonstrations manifested themselves throughout Indonesia. This led to several confrontations on the streets between protesters and security forces, and recriminations over the violence. The protests culminated in the military allowing Megawati&#x27;s supporters to take over PDI headquarters in Jakarta, with a pledge of no further demonstrations.

Suharto allowed the occupation of PDI headquarters to go on for almost a month, as attentions were also on Jakarta due to a set of high-profile ASEAN meetings scheduled to take place there. Capitalizing on this, Megawati supporters organised &quot;democracy forums&quot; with several speakers at the site. On 26 July, officers of the military, Suryadi, and Suharto openly aired their disgust with the forums.

On 27 July, police, soldiers, and persons claiming to be Suryadi supporters stormed the headquarters. Several Megawati supporters were killed, and over two hundred people were arrested and tried under the Anti-Subversion and Hate-Spreading laws. The day would become known as &quot;Black Saturday&quot; and mark the beginning of a renewed crackdown by the New Order government against supporters of democracy, now called the &quot;Reformasi&quot; or Reform movement.

===Economic crisis and Suharto&#x27;s resignation===
In 1997 and 1998, Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which had dire consequences for the Indonesian economy and society, as well as Suharto&#x27;s presidency. At the same time, the country suffered a severe drought and some of the largest forest fires in history burned in Kalimantan and Sumatra. The rupiah, the Indonesian currency, took a sharp dive in value. Suharto came under scrutiny from international lending institutions, chiefly the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the United States, over longtime embezzlement of funds and some protectionist policies. In December, Suharto&#x27;s government signed a letter of intent to the IMF, pledging to enact austerity measures, including cuts to public services and removal of subsidies, in return for aid from the IMF and other donors. Prices for goods such as kerosene and rice, as well as fees for public services including education, rose dramatically. The effects were exacerbated by widespread corruption. The austerity measures approved by Suharto had started to erode domestic confidence with the New Order and led to popular protests.

Suharto stood for re-election by parliament for the seventh time in March 1998, justifying it on the grounds of the necessity of his leadership during the crisis. The parliament approved a new term. This sparked protests and riots throughout the country, now termed the Indonesian 1998 Revolution. Dissent within the ranks of his own Golkar party and the military finally weakened Suharto, and on 21 May he stood down from power. He was replaced by his deputy, Vice President B.J. Habibie.

President Habibie quickly assembled a cabinet. One of its main tasks was to re-establish International Monetary Fund and donor community support for an economic stabilisation program. He moved quickly to release political prisoners and lift some controls on freedom of speech and association. Elections for the national, provincial, and sub-provincial parliaments were held on 7 June 1999. In the elections for the national parliament, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P, led by Sukarno&#x27;s daughter Megawati Sukarnoputri) won 34% of the vote; Golkar (Suharto&#x27;s party, formerly the only legal party of government) 22%; United Development Party (PPP, led by Hamzah Haz) 12%; and National Awakening Party (PKB, led by Abdurrahman Wahid) 10%.
===May 1998 riots===
The May 1998 riots of Indonesia also known as the 1998 tragedy or simply the 1998 event, were incidents of mass violence, demonstrations, and civil unrest of a racial nature that occurred throughout Indonesia.

===Politics since 1999===
In October 1999, the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPR), which consists of the 500-member Parliament plus 200 appointed members, elected Abdurrahman Wahid, commonly referred to as &quot;Gus Dur&quot;, as President, and Megawati Sukarnoputri as Vice-President, both for five-year terms. Wahid named his first Cabinet in early November 1999 and a reshuffled, second Cabinet in August 2000. President Wahid&#x27;s government continued to pursue democratisation and to encourage renewed economic growth under challenging conditions. In addition to continuing economic malaise, his government faced regional, interethnic, and interreligious conflict, particularly in Aceh, the Maluku Islands, and Irian Jaya. In West Timor, the problems of displaced East Timorese and violence by pro-Indonesian East Timorese militias caused considerable humanitarian and social problems. An increasingly assertive Parliament frequently challenged President Wahid&#x27;s policies and prerogatives, contributing to a lively and sometimes rancorous national political debate.
During the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly&#x27;s first annual session in August 2000, President Wahid gave an account of his government&#x27;s performance. On 29 January 2001, thousands of student protesters stormed parliament grounds and demanded that President Abdurrahman Wahid resign due to alleged involvement in corruption scandals. Under pressure from the Assembly to improve management and co-ordination within the government, he issued a presidential decree giving Vice-President Megawati control over the day-to-day administration of government. Soon after, Megawati Sukarnoputri assumed the presidency on 23 July. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono won Indonesia&#x27;s first direct presidential election in 2004, and was reelected in 2009.

Joko Widodo, the PDI-P candidate, was elected president in 2014. Having previously served as the Governor of Jakarta, he is the first Indonesian president without a high-ranking political or military background. However, his opponent Prabowo Subianto disputed the outcome and withdrew from the race before the count was completed. Jokowi was reelected in 2019, again defeating Prabowo Subianto. In March 2024, Prabowo Subianto, nationalist former general, won the presidential election, meaning he became Indonesia’s next president with his running mate Gibran Rakabuming Raka, son of outgoing President Joko Widodo, as new vice president. On 20 October 2024, Prabowo Subianto was sworn in as Indonesia&#x27;s eighth president along with Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka.

===Terrorism===
As a multi-ethnic and multicultural democratic country with a Muslim-majority population, Indonesia faces the challenge of dealing with terrorism linked to global militant Islamic movements. Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), a militant Islamic organisation that aspires for the establishment of a Daulah Islamiyah across Southeast Asia, is responsible for a series of terrorist attacks in Indonesia. This terrorist organisation, linked to Al-Qaeda, was responsible for the Bali bombings in 2002 and 2005, as well as Jakarta bombings in 2003, 2004, and 2009. The Indonesian government and authorities have tried to crack down on terrorist cells in Indonesia.

On 14 January 2016, suicide bombers and gunmen initiated a terror attack in Jakarta, resulting in the death of eight people: three Indonesian civilians, a Canadian and four of the attackers. Twenty people were wounded during the attack. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the incident.

===Tsunami disaster and Aceh peace deal===
On 26 December 2004, a massive earthquake and tsunami devastated parts of northern Sumatra, particularly Aceh. Partly as a result of the need for co-operation and peace during the recovery from the tsunami in Aceh, peace talks between the Indonesian government and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) were restarted. Accords signed in Helsinki created a framework for military de-escalation in which the government has reduced its military presence, as members of GAM&#x27;s armed wing decommission their weapons and apply for amnesty. The agreement also allows for local parties to be established, and other autonomy measures.

===Forest and plantation fires===
Since 1997 Indonesia has been struggling to contain forest fires, especially on the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan. Haze occurs annually during the dry season and is largely caused by illegal agricultural fires due to slash-and-burn practices in Indonesia, especially in the provinces of South Sumatra and Riau on Indonesia&#x27;s Sumatra island, and Kalimantan on Indonesian Borneo. The haze that occurred in 1997 was one of the most severe; dense hazes occurred again in 2005, 2006, 2009, 2013, and the worst was in 2015, killing dozens of Indonesians as a result of respiratory illnesses and road accidents due to poor visibility. Another 10 people were killed due to smog from forest and land fires.

In September 2014, Indonesia ratified the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, becoming the last ASEAN country to do so.

=== Reign of Prabowo ===
On 14 February 2024, Indonesia held a presidential election. The candidates included Anies Baswedan, former governor of Jakarta; Prabowo Subianto, a former general; and Ganjar Pranowo, former governor of Central Java.

On 20 October 2024, Prabowo Subianto and his running mate, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, were sworn in as the President and Vice President of Indonesia, following their victory in the February election.

<text>Indonesia is an archipelagic country located in Southeast Asia and Oceania, lying between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. It is located in a strategic location astride or along major sea lanes connecting East Asia, South Asia and Oceania. Indonesia is the largest archipelago in the world. Indonesia&#x27;s various regional cultures have been shaped—although not specifically determined—by centuries of complex interactions with its physical environment.

==Overview==

Indonesia is an archipelagic country extending about from east to west and from north to south. It is considered to be the largest archipelagic country in the world. According to a geospatial survey conducted between 2007 and 2010 by National Coordinating Agency for Survey and Mapping (Bakosurtanal), Indonesia has 17,500 islands. While earlier survey conducted in 2002 by National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) stated Indonesia has 18,307 islands. According to the CIA World Factbook, there are 17,508 islands. The discrepancy between the surveys is likely caused by the earlier different survey method including tidal islands, sandy cays and rocky reefs that surface during low tide and submerge during high tide. There are 8,844 named islands according to estimates made by the government of Indonesia, with 922 of those being permanent. It comprises five main islands: Sumatra, Java, Borneo (known as &quot;Kalimantan&quot; in Indonesia), Sulawesi, and New Guinea; two major island groups (Nusa Tenggara and the Maluku Islands) and sixty smaller island groups. Four of the islands are shared with other countries: Borneo is shared with Malaysia and Brunei; Sebatik, located off the northeastern coast of Kalimantan, shared with Malaysia; Timor is shared with East Timor; and New Guinea is shared with Papua New Guinea.

Indonesia has total land area of , including of inland seas (straits, bays, and other bodies of water). This makes it the largest island country in the world. The additional surrounding sea areas bring Indonesia&#x27;s generally recognised territory (land and sea) to about 5 million km2. The government claims an exclusive economic zone of . This brings the total area to about 7.9 million km2.

Indonesia is a transcontinental country, where its territory consisted of islands geologically considered as part of either Asia or Australia. During the Pleistocene, the Greater Sunda Islands were connected to the Asian mainland while New Guinea was connected to Australia. Karimata Strait, Java Sea and Arafura Sea were formed as the sea level rose at the end of the Pleistocene.

==Geology==

The main islands of Sumatra, Java, Madura, and Kalimantan lie on the Sunda plate and geographers have conventionally grouped them, (along with Sulawesi), as the Greater Sunda Islands. At Indonesia&#x27;s eastern extremity is western New Guinea, which lies on the Australian plate. Sea depths in the Sunda and Sahul shelves average or less. Between these two shelves lie Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara (also known as the Lesser Sunda Islands), and the Maluku Islands (or the Moluccas), which form a second island group with deep, surrounding seas down to in depth. The term &quot;Outer Islands&quot; is used inconsistently by various writers but it is usually taken to mean those islands other than Java and Madura.

Sulawesi is an island lies on three separate plates, the Banda Sea plate, Molucca Sea plate, and Sunda plate. Seismic and volcanic activities are high on its northeastern part, evidenced by the formation of volcanoes in North Sulawesi and island arcs such as the Sangihe and Talaud Islands, southwest of the Philippine Trench.

Nusa Tenggara or Lesser Sunda Islands consists of two strings of islands stretching eastward from Bali toward southern Maluku. The inner arc of Nusa Tenggara is a continuation of the Alpide belt chain of mountains and volcanoes extending from Sumatra through Java, Bali, and Flores, and trailing off in the volcanic Banda Islands, which along with the Kai Islands and the Tanimbar Islands and other small islands in the Banda Sea are typical examples of the Wallacea mixture of Asian and Australasian plant and animal life. The outer arc of Nusa Tenggara is a geological extension of the chain of islands west of Sumatra that includes Nias, Mentawai, and Enggano. This chain resurfaces in Nusa Tenggara in the ruggedly mountainous islands of Sumba and Timor.

The Maluku Islands (or Moluccas) are geologically among the most complex of the Indonesian islands, consisted of four different tectonic plates. They are located in the northeast sector of the archipelago, bounded by the Philippine Sea to the north, Papua to the east, and Nusa Tenggara to the southwest. The largest of these islands include Halmahera, Seram and Buru, all of which rise steeply out of very deep seas and have unique Wallacea vegetation. This abrupt relief pattern from sea to high mountains means that there are very few level coastal plains. To the south lies the Banda Sea. The convergence between the Banda Sea plate and Australian plate created a chain of volcanic islands called the Banda Arc. The sea also contains the Weber Deep, one of the deepest point in Indonesia.

Geomorphologists believe that the island of New Guinea is part of the Australian continent, both lies on Sahul Shelf and once joined via a land bridge during the Last glacial period. The tectonic movement of the Australian plate created towering, snowcapped mountain peaks lining the island&#x27;s central east–west spine and hot, humid alluvial plains along the coasts. The New Guinea Highlands range some east to west along the island, forming a mountainous spine between the northern and southern portion of the island. Due to its tectonic movement, New Guinea experienced many earthquakes and tsunamis, especially in its northern and western part.

===Tectonism and volcanism===

Most of the larger islands are mountainous, with peaks ranging between meters above sea level in Sumatra, Java, Bali, Lombok, Sulawesi, and Seram. The country&#x27;s tallest mountains are located in the Jayawijaya Mountains and the Sudirman Range in Papua. The highest peak, Puncak Jaya (), is located in the Sudirman Mountains. A string of volcanoes stretches from Sumatra to Nusa Tenggara, and then loops around through to the Banda Islands of Maluku to northeastern Sulawesi. Of the 400 volcanoes, approximately 150 are active. Two of the most violent volcanic eruptions in modern times occurred in Indonesia; in 1815 Mount Tambora in Sumbawa erupted killing 92,000 and in 1883, Krakatau, erupted killing 36,000. While volcanic ashes resulted from eruption has positive effects for the fertility of the surrounding soils, it also makes agricultural conditions unpredictable in some areas.
Indonesia has relatively high tectonic and volcanic activities. It lies on the convergence between the Eurasian, Indo-Australian, Pacific, and Philippine Sea plate. The Sunda megathrust is a 5,500 km long fault located off southern coasts of Sumatra, Java and Lesser Sunda Islands, where the Indo-Australian Plate is thrusting northeastward towards the subducting Sunda Plate. Tectonic movement in this fault is responsible for the creation of the Sunda Trench, and mountain ranges across Sumatra, Java, and the Lesser Sunda Islands. Many great earthquakes occurred in the vicinity of the fault, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Mount Merapi, located in the Java portion of the megathrust, is the most active volcano in Indonesia and is designated as one of world&#x27;s Decade Volcanoes due to the hazard it poses to the surrounding populated areas. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami devastated the Indonesian provinces of Aceh and North Sumatra, resulting in approximately 225,000 deaths and leaving over 425,000 people homeless. The disaster caused significant damage to infrastructure, homes, and local industries. The Indonesian government, in partnership with international organizations like the IMF, World Bank, and ADB, coordinated relief and reconstruction efforts. Preliminary assessments estimated the reconstruction cost at $4-5 billion over five years. During a donor meeting in January 2005, nearly $4 billion in aid was pledged for reconstruction, with a focus on transparency and efficient fund management. Despite the severe local impact, the overall effect on Indonesia’s national GDP was limited, as the Aceh region contributed only about 2% of national output. The Paris Club also offered a temporary debt moratorium, which helped fund rebuilding without diverting domestic financial resources.

The northern part of Sulawesi and Maluku Islands lie on the convergence of Sunda Plate and Molucca Sea plate, making it an active tectonic region with volcanic chains such as the Sangihe and Talaud Islands. Northern Maluku and western New Guinea is located on the convergence of Bird&#x27;s Head, Philippine Sea and Caroline plate. It is also a seismically active region, with the 7.6 Mw 2009 Papua earthquakes being the most recent great earthquake to date in the region.

== Ecology ==

Borneo is the third largest island in the world and the native vegetation was mostly Borneo lowland rain forests although much of this has been cleared with wildlife retreating to the Borneo montane rain forests inland. The islands of North Maluku are the original Spice Islands, a distinct rainforest ecoregion. A number of islands off the coast of New Guinea have their own distinctive biogeographic features, including the limestone islands of Biak, in the entrance to the large Cenderawasih Bay at the northwest end of the island.

A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 14,416 km2 of tidal flats in Indonesia, ranking it 1st in the world in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there. Another global analysis also estimated that Indonesia experienced the greatest total tidal wetland change (36% of global net change including mangroves, tidal flats, and tidal marshes) between 1999 and 2019 with a net loss of .

== Time zones ==
Indonesia is divided into three time zones:
*Western Indonesian Time/WIT (Indonesian: &quot;Waktu Indonesia Barat&quot;/WIB) (UTC+7)
**WIB is observed in islands of Sumatra, Java, provinces of West Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan.
*Central Indonesian Time/CIT (&quot;Waktu Indonesia Tengah&quot;/WITA) (UTC+8)
**WITA is observed in islands of Sulawesi, Lesser Sunda Islands, provinces of East Kalimantan, South Kalimantan, and North Kalimantan.
*Eastern Indonesian Time/EIT (&quot;Waktu Indonesia Timur&quot;/WIT) (UTC+9).
**WIT is observed in provinces of Maluku, North Maluku, Papua, West Papua, Southwest Papua, Central Papua, South Papua, and Highland Papua.

== Climate ==

Lying along the equator, Indonesia&#x27;s climate tends to be relatively even year-round. Indonesia has two seasons—a wet season and a dry season—with no extremes of summer or winter. For most of Indonesia, the dry season falls between May and October while the wet season between November and April.

Some regions, such as Kalimantan and Sumatra, experience only slight differences in rainfall and temperature between the seasons, whereas others, such as Nusa Tenggara, experience far more pronounced differences with droughts in the dry season, and floods in the wet. Rainfall in Indonesia is plentiful, particularly in west Sumatra, northwest Kalimantan, west Java, and western New Guinea.

Parts of Sulawesi and some islands closer to Australia, such as Sumba and Timor, are drier, however, these are exceptions. The almost uniformly warm waters that make up 81% of Indonesia&#x27;s area ensure that temperatures on land remain fairly constant. The coastal plains averaging , the inland and mountain areas averaging , and the higher mountain regions, . The area&#x27;s relative humidity ranges between 70 and 90%.

Winds are moderate and generally predictable, with monsoons usually blowing in from the south and east in June through October and from the northwest in November through March. Typhoons and large scale storms pose little hazard to mariners in Indonesia waters; the major danger comes from swift currents in channels, such as the Lombok and Sape straits.

Indonesia&#x27;s climate is almost entirely tropical, dominated by the tropical rainforest climate found in every major island of Indonesia, followed by the tropical monsoon climate that predominantly lies along Java&#x27;s coastal north, Sulawesi&#x27;s coastal south and east, and Bali, and finally the tropical savanna climate, found in isolated locations of Central Java, lowland East Java, coastal southern Papua and smaller islands to the east of Lombok.

However, cooler climate types do exist in mountainous regions of Indonesia 1,300–1,500 metres above sea level. The oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) prevail in highland areas with fairly uniform precipitation year-round, adjacent to rainforest climates, while the subtropical highland climate (Köppen &quot;Cwb&quot;) exist in highland areas with a more pronounced dry season, adjacent to tropical monsoon and savanna climates.

Above 3000 metres is where cold, subpolar climates dominate and where frost and occasional snow become more commonplace. The subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfc&quot;), existing between 3,000 and 3,500 metres, can be found on the mountain slopes of Indonesia&#x27;s highest peaks, and serves as a transition between oceanic climates and tundra climates. Tundra climates (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;), are found anywhere above 3500 metres on the highest peaks of Indonesia, including the permanently snow-capped peaks in Papua. In this climate regime, average monthly temperatures are all below 10 °C, and monthly precipitation is uniform.

==Environmental issues==

Indonesia&#x27;s high population and rapid industrialisation present serious environmental issues, which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak, under-resourced governance. Issues include large-scale deforestation (much of it illegal) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore; over-exploitation of marine resources; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanisation and economic development, including air pollution, traffic congestion, garbage management, and reliable water and waste water services.

Deforestation and the destruction of peatlands make Indonesia the world&#x27;s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species, including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) as threatened, and 15 identified as critically endangered, including the Sumatran Orangutan.

In 1970, 15% of Indonesians lived in cities compared to over 30% today, and this increases pressure on the urban environment. Industrial pollution is increasing, particularly in Java, and the increasing affluence of the growing middle class drives a rapid increase in the number of motor vehicles and associated emissions. Garbage and waste water services are being placed under increasing pressure. Reliance on septic systems or effluent disposal in open canals and river systems remains the norm, and is a major polluter of water resources. Very few Indonesians have access to safe drinking water and must boil water before use.

The geographical resources of the Indonesian archipelago have been exploited in ways that fall into consistent social and historical patterns. One cultural pattern consists of the formerly Indianized, rice-growing peasants in the valleys and plains of Sumatra, Java, and Bali, another cultural complex is composed of the largely Islamic coastal commercial sector, a third, more marginal sector consists of the upland forest farming communities which exist by means of subsistence swidden agriculture. To some degree, these patterns can be linked to the geographical resources themselves, with abundant shoreline, generally calm seas, and steady winds favouring the use of sailing vessels, and fertile valleys and plains—at least in the Greater Sunda Islands—permitting irrigated rice farming. The heavily forested, mountainous interior hinders overland communication by road or river, but fosters slash-and-burn agriculture.

<text>The population of Indonesia was 270.20 million according to the 2020 national census, an increase from 237.64 million in 2010. The official estimate as at end 2023 was 280 million increasing at a rate of 1.17% per year. Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world. Approximately 55% of Indonesia&#x27;s population resides on Java, which is the most populous island in the world.

Despite a fairly effective family planning program that has been in place since 1967, Indonesia&#x27;s average population growth per year was over 1.1% for the decade ending in 2020, nearly having 13% population growth for that decade. At this rate, Indonesia&#x27;s population is projected to surpass the population of the United States if the recent population growth continues.

Indonesia has a relatively young population compared to Western nations, though it is aging as the country&#x27;s birth rate has slowed and its life expectancy has increased. The median age was 30.2 years in 2017. Indonesia encompasses thousands of different ethnic groups, cultures, and hundreds of languages, some of which are related to each other. Since independence, Indonesian is the language of most written communication, education, government, and business. Many local ethnic languages are the first language of most Indonesians and are still important. Examples of local languages are Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese.

==Ethnic groups==

Indonesia is a country of great ethnic diversity, with approximately 600 distinct indigenous ethnic groups living side by side across more than 17,000 islands. The majority of Indonesia&#x27;s population is descended from Austronesian peoples who are concentrated in western and central Indonesia, which is part of the Asian continent. Another large group is the Melanesian peoples, who inhabit the eastern part of Indonesia (the Maluku Islands, Western New Guinea, and the East Nusa Tenggara) in Oceania.

The Javanese are the largest ethnic group, accounting for 40.2% of the population and are culturally, economically, and politically dominant. The Javanese are concentrated in Java, the most populous island, especially in the central and eastern parts, and also in significant numbers in most provinces due to extensive migration throughout the archipelago. The Sundanese are the next largest group (15.4%), followed by the Malays, Batak, Madurese, Betawi, Minangkabau, and Bugis. A sense of Indonesian nationalism is present along with strong ethnic and regional identities.

==Languages==
Indonesian is the official and national language of Indonesia, widely spoken by over 97% of the population. However, Indonesia is a highly multilingual country. According to Ethnologue, there are currently 737 regional languages spoken across the Indonesian archipelago. This extensive linguistic diversity accounts for about 10% of the world’s total languages, making Indonesia the second most linguistically diverse country in the world. The majority of these languages belong to the Austronesian language family, which is prevalent in the western and central regions of Indonesia, including languages such as Acehnese, Batak, Sundanese, Balinese, Banjarese and Buginese. In contrast, the eastern regions, particularly Papua and the Maluku Islands, are home to over 270 Papuan languages, which are distinct from the Austronesian language family and represent a unique linguistic heritage. The most widely spoken language as a mother tongue is Javanese, spoken by over 80 million speakers, mainly in central and east Java, but also on many other islands due to migration.

==Religion==
Indonesia is the world&#x27;s most populous Muslim-majority nation; based on civil registration data in 2023 from Ministry of Home Affairs, 87.06% of Indonesians are Muslims, 10.47% Christians (7.41% Protestants, 3.06% Roman Catholic), 1.68% Hindu, 0.71% Buddhists, 0.03% Confucians and 0.05% other faiths. Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are Chinese.

<text>The politics of Indonesia take place in the framework of a presidential representative democratic republic whereby the President of Indonesia is both head of state and head of government and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the bicameral People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.

The 1945 constitution provided for a limited separation of executive, legislative and judicial power. The governmental system has been described as &quot;presidential with parliamentary characteristics&quot;. Indonesia was democratic upon independence, but became authoritarian in 1957 under Sukarno. It remained authoritarian under his successor Suharto until the Indonesian riots of May 1998 and the resignation of President Suharto, which led to the restoration of democracy in Indonesia.

 According to the V-Dem Democracy indices Indonesia was 2023 the 11th most electoral democratic country in Asia. Indonesia&#x27;s political parties have been characterized as cartel parties with extensive power-sharing among parties and limited accountability to voters.

According to the American think tank Freedom House, Indonesia fails to meet many of the civil requirements for a consolidated, or maximalist, democracy. The court system often has many instances of corruption, and there is no due process many in civil and criminal matters.

==History==
===Old Order: Liberal Democracy and Guided Democracy===
The &quot;Old Order&quot; (1950–1965) in Indonesia has long been understood to be a period of turmoil and crisis, characterized by rebellions and political unrest. The weakness of Indonesia&#x27;s democracy and its gradual transition to authoritarianism during the Old Order can be attributed to conventional modernization theory, which suggests that without strong socioeconomic structures, successful transitions to democracy are unlikely. Indeed, it was not until the late 1960s when urbanization took place that the Indonesian government began to build a stronger democracy.

During the &quot;Liberal Democracy&quot; period (1950–1957), Indonesia aspired to renew its global status and achieve modernity as a newly independent country. In line with this vision, it sought to establish a democratic parliamentary system, bringing forth a &quot;multi-party system, cabinet government under a prime minister, and a ceremonial president&quot;. However, the economic instability inherited from colonial rule significantly hindered their democratic nation-building vision: the Indonesian economy struggled to recover from the hardships of colonial occupation, with economic growth being stagnant and inflation reaching over 600% between the 1950s-1960s. Indonesia&#x27;s economy heavily relied on the agricultural sector, but without diversification and industrialization, the government became vulnerable to polarization and instability.

Moreover, Indonesia&#x27;s abundance of natural resources, such as coffee, rubber, and cocoa, made it susceptible to the political resource curse: Indonesia&#x27;s resource wealth led to corruption, inequality, and political instability, hindering economic and social progress; the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few elites with a monopoly over these resources worsened the country&#x27;s economic and political problems. This ultimately led to rising political tensions and the government&#x27;s loss of control.

&quot;Guided Democracy&quot;, which was in place from 1957 to 1966, aimed to bring about political stability, modernization, and development under the leadership of President Sukarno. Initially, Sukarno sought to build political institutions to bolster representation and resolve conflicts of regionalism, social class, and religion that plagued the Parliament during the Liberal Democracy era. However, power became increasingly centralized to the executive branch in the latter half of Guided Democracy, with Sukarno assuming a dictator-like role in the government. Indonesia&#x27;s gradual transition to authoritarianism during the Guided Democracy period exemplifies the failure of the democratic project in the country due to weak socio-economic structures and the political resource curse that undermined its democratic development.

===Transition to the New Order===
The transition to the &quot;New Order&quot; in the mid-1960s, ousted Sukarno after 22 years in the position. One of the most tumultuous periods in the country&#x27;s modern history, it was the commencement of Suharto&#x27;s three-decade presidency. Described as the great &quot;dhalang&quot; (&quot;puppet master&quot;), Sukarno drew power from balancing the opposing and increasingly antagonistic forces of the army and the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI).

By 1965, the PKI extensively penetrated all levels of government and gained influence at the expense of the army. On 30 September 1965, six of the military&#x27;s most senior officers were killed in an action (generally labelled an &quot;attempted coup&quot;) by the so-called 30 September Movement, a group from within the armed forces. Within a few hours, Major General Suharto mobilised forces under his command and took control of Jakarta. Anti-communists, initially following the army&#x27;s lead, went on a violent purge of communists throughout the country, killing an estimated half million people and destroying the PKI, which was officially blamed for the crisis.

The politically weakened Sukarno was forced to transfer key political and military powers to General Suharto, who had become head of the armed forces. In March 1967, the Provisional People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPRS) named General Suharto acting president. He was formally appointed president one year later. Sukarno lived under virtual house arrest until his death in 1970. In contrast to the stormy nationalism, revolutionary rhetoric, and economic failure that characterised the early 1960s under the left-leaning Sukarno, Suharto&#x27;s pro-Western &quot;New Order&quot; stabilised the economy but continued the official state philosophy of &quot;Pancasila&quot;.

===New Order===

Sukarno-Indonesia&#x27;s first national figure and president-dissolved the elected assembly, introduced a concept known as Guided Democracy, and reinstated the 1945 constitution in 1959. The period of Guided Democracy was marked by the creation of a plethora of ministries, by the rise of the Indonesia Communist Party (Partai Komunis Indonesia; PKI) to a position of political dominance, and by the emergence of the army as a major anticommunist political force. The structure collapsed with an attempted coup d&#x27;état in 1965, which led to the downfall of Sukarno. Under Suharto, Sukarno&#x27;s successor, Indonesia entered a new political era, officially called the New Order

The New Order () is the term coined by President Suharto to characterise his regime as he came to power in 1966. He used this term to contrast his rule with that of his predecessor, Sukarno (dubbed the &quot;Old Order,&quot; or &quot;Orde Lama&quot;). The term &quot;New Order&quot; in more recent times has become synonymous with the Suharto years (1966–1998).

Immediately following the attempted coup in 1965, the political situation was uncertain, but the New Order found much popular support from groups wanting a separation from Indonesia&#x27;s problems since its independence. The &#x27;generation of 66&#x27; (&quot;Angkatan 66&quot;) epitomised talk of a new group of young leaders and new intellectual thought. Following communal and political conflicts, and economic collapse and social breakdown of the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s, the New Order was committed to achieving and maintaining political order, economic development, and the removal of mass participation in the political process. The features of the New Order established from the late 1960s were thus a strong political role for the military, the bureaucratisation and corporatisation of political and societal organisations, and selective but effective repression of opponents. Strident anti-communism remained a hallmark of the regime for its subsequent 32 years.

Within a few years, however, many of its original allies had become indifferent or averse to the New Order, which comprised a military faction supported by a narrow civilian group. Among much of the pro-democracy movement which forced Suharto to resign in 1998 and then gained power, the term &quot;New Order&quot; has come to be used pejoratively. It is frequently employed to describe figures who were either tied to the New Order, or who upheld the practises of his authoritarian regime, such as corruption, collusion and nepotism (widely known by the acronym KKN: &quot;korupsi&quot;, &quot;kolusi&quot;, &quot;nepotisme&quot;).

===Reform era===
The Post-Suharto era began with the fall of Suharto in 1998 during which Indonesia has been in a period of transition, an era known as &quot;Reformasi&quot; (English: &quot;Reform&quot;). This period has seen a more open and liberal political-social environment.

Indonesia&#x27;s transition to democracy was a key part of the broader reform era. Democratic transitions tend to be grouped into two categories: bottom-up transitions where people rise up and overthrow an existing regime, and top-down transitions where an authoritarian ruler introduces liberalizing reforms leading to democratic transition. Indonesia experienced a transition toward democratic rule that involved both bottom-up and top-down forces after the fall of the authoritarian regime in 1998, thus altering the political structure of the country. Differences in democratization across developing countries, including Indonesia, is common and may be explained by different theoretical models. While Indonesia has been considered a democracy since the fall of the authoritarian regime in 1998, democratic consolidation has not completely been achieved.

A process of constitutional reform lasted from 1999 to 2002, with four amendments producing major changes. Among these were term limits of up to two five-year terms for the president and vice president and measures to institute checks and balances. The highest state institution is the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (, MPR), whose functions previously included electing the president and vice-president (since 2004 the president has been elected directly by the people), establishing broad guidelines of state policy, and amending the constitution. The 695-member MPR includes all 550 members of the House of Representatives (, DPR) plus 130 members of Regional Representative Council (, DPD) elected by the 26 provincial parliaments and 65 appointed members from societal groups.

The DPR, which is the premier legislative institution, originally included 462 members elected through a mixed proportional/district representational system and thirty-eight appointed members of the Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI) and police (POLRI). TNI/POLRI representation in the DPR and MPR ended in 2004. Societal group representation in the MPR was eliminated in 2004 through further constitutional change. Having served as rubberstamp bodies in the past, the DPR and MPR have gained considerable power and are increasingly assertive in oversight of the executive branch. Under constitutional changes in 2004, the MPR became a bicameral legislature, with the creation of the DPD, in which each province is represented by four members, although its legislative powers are more limited than those of the DPR. Through his/her appointed cabinet, the president retains the authority to conduct the administration of the government.

A general election in June 1999 produced the first freely elected national, provincial and regional parliaments in over 40 years. In October 1999, the MPR elected a compromise candidate, Abdurrahman Wahid, as the country&#x27;s fourth president, and Megawati Sukarnoputri—a daughter of Sukarno—as the vice-president. Megawati&#x27;s PDI-P party had won the largest share of the vote (34%) in the general election, while Golkar, the dominant party during the New Order, came in second (22%). Several other, mostly Islamic parties won shares large enough to be seated in the DPR. Other nationwide democratic elections took place in 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019.
In Indonesia, while free and fair elections have been held and a constitution guaranteeing certain rights and freedoms exists, corruption and involvement of money in politics persists. Corruption in regional government is often revenue-related, involving bribery and theft of public goods for personal gain, and identifies political corruption, such as fraudulent behavior and deviant lobbying techniques, as the type committed by government officials. Additionally, one of the primary reasons Indonesia may not be considered a consolidated democracy is due to their lack of “civilian control over the military”. Indonesia has created democratic institutions, but there is still progress that must be made to address the challenges the country currently faces in order to consolidate democracy.

After the Reformasi, Indonesia became a patronage democracy, where state resources are distributed among political parties. While patronage weakens democratic institutions and accountability, it serves as a powerful incentive for compromise and cooperation. Parties get into governing coalitions regardless of ideology to access state resources. This cut across identity-based cleavages. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&#x27;s leadership contained social conflict by mediating between conflicting forces and accommodating potential opposition. Yudhoyono&#x27;s presidency was a period of democratic stagnation but also of peace, stability, and absence of political polarization. The 2014 Indonesian presidential election marked a rise of polarization, with an Islamist-pluralist divide, which continued in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election and the 2019 Indonesian presidential election.

Currently, scholars are conflicted about the strength and durability of Indonesia&#x27;s democracy. Indonesia scores well on certain characteristics of democracy, such as political rights, classifying it as a democracy in the minimalist interpretation of the word. However, the country lacks other aspects of democracy that are usually required for a regime to reach democratic consolidation, such as adequate civil rights protections.

A minimalist view of democracy classifies political regimes purely in terms of their institutions and procedures rather than the outcomes they produce. Specifically, a regime must implement free and fair elections. In Indonesia, the president is directly elected and can serve up to two five-year terms. There are limited voting irregularities, and international election monitors consider the elections free and fair. Additionally, in 2019, the Constitutional Court rejected claims of widespread voter fraud. The right to organize competing political parties is respected, and the system allows for the competition of several political parties. Thus, according to the minimalist definition, Indonesia is a democracy.

However, a maximalist approach to democracy claims that free and fair elections are insufficient to consider a regime a democracy. Maximalists argue that these countries must also guarantee other social, political, and economic rights, often those found in consolidated democracies. These include human rights protections, civil rights, egalitarianism, judicial independence, and more.

==Civil society in Indonesia==
Civil society is a term that has been coined by both sides of the political spectrum for their respective interests. It is defined broadly by David Rieff as the wide range of organizations operating outside the governmental and business sectors. It has taken on ambiguous connotations as Robert Putnam has associated it with the strengthening of Democratic government while Sheri Berman has demonstrated how civil associations helped to collapse Weimar Germany. As with any other country, Indonesian civil society spans an array of organizations including professional, religious, intermediary, and mass-based. Under Suharto, civil society organizations (CSOs) often fought for democracy and human rights.

Under Suharto, civil society in Indonesia was massively contained. The mass murders of the left limited CSOs to advocacy relating to human rights and democracy. After his fall, civil society established itself in the reformed era. CSOs in Indonesia are reflective of the unique politics of the country. They exist on a spectrum of opinion on Islam&#x27;s proper role in the government. For example, in 2017, the Indonesian government prohibited the Indonesian Chapter of Hizb ut-Tahrir. Using the Law on Mass-Based Organizations (ORMAS). Some CSOs condemned the action as a violation of human rights while others saw the move as a necessity in curbing extremist ideology. ORMAS represents new bureaucratic regulations and restrictions on CSOs. The passage of this law has been associated with the Indonesian government&#x27;s continued crackdown on free speech and expression.

Humanprogress.org provides a Civil Society Participation Index which measures whether “major CSOs routinely consulted by policymakers; how large is the involvement of people in CSOs; are women prevented from participating;” among a variety of other factors. Indonesia&#x27;s Civil Society Index has fluctuated throughout the 20th century. During the period of liberal democracy before Sukarno, Indonesia reached a Civil Society Participation score of 0.74. During the presidencies of Sukarno and Suharto, the score plunged to 0.12. As Indonesia entered its Reform Era, the score climbed to 0.95; however in recent years Indonesia&#x27;s Civil Society Participation Index has declined to 0.82. Compared to its neighbors in Southeast Asia, Indonesia has been hailed as a champion for free expression in the region. Other tools to measure civil society are the CSO Sustainability Index Explorer by csosi.org and the Civil Society Index provided by the United Nations Development Programme.

==Executive branch==

|President
|Prabowo Subianto
|Gerindra
|20 October 2024
|Vice President
|Gibran Rakabuming Raka
|Independent
|20 October 2024
The executive branch of Indonesia is headed by a president, who is head of government and head of state. The president is elected by general election and can serve up to two five-year terms if re-elected. The executive branch also includes a vice-president and a cabinet. All bills need joint approval between the executive and the legislature to become law, meaning the president has veto power over all legislation. The president also has the power to issue presidential decrees that have policy effects, and is also in charge of Indonesia&#x27;s foreign relations, although treaties require legislative approval. Prior to 2004, the president was selected by the MPR, but following the third amendment to the constitution, enacted in 2001, the president is now directly elected. The last election was held in February 2024, and Prabowo was elected and inaugurated on 20 October 2024.

==Legislative branch==
The MPR is the legislative branch of Indonesia&#x27;s political system. The MPR is composed of two houses: the DPR, which is commonly called the House of Representatives, and the DPD, which is called the Regional Representative Council. The 575 DPR members are elected through multi-member electoral districts, whereas 4 DPD senators are elected in each of Indonesia&#x27;s 34 provinces. The DPR holds most of the legislative power because it has the sole power to pass laws. The DPD acts as a supplementary body to the DPR; it can propose bills, offer its opinion and participate in discussions, but it has no legal power. The MPR itself has power outside of those given to the individual houses. It can amend the constitution, inaugurate the president and conduct impeachment procedures. When the MPR acts in this function, it does so by simply combining the members of the two houses.

==Political parties and elections==

The General Elections Commission (, &quot;KPU&quot;) is the body that is responsible for running both parliamentary and presidential elections. Article 22E(5) of the Constitution rules that the KPU is national, permanent, and independent. Prior to the 2004 elections, the KPU was made up of members who were also members of political parties. However, members of KPU must now be non-partisan.

===Latest election===
====President====
=== House of Representatives ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Judicial branch==
Both the Supreme Court of Indonesia () and the Constitutional Court () are the highest level of the judicial branch. The Constitutional Court listens to disputes concerning legality of law, general elections, dissolution of political parties, and the scope of authority of state institution. It has 9 judges appointed by the DPR, the President and the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of Indonesia hears final cessation appeals and conducts case reviews. It has 51 judges divided into 8 chambers. Its judges are nominated by the Judicial Commission of Indonesia and appointed by the President. Most civil disputes appear before the State Court (); appeals are heard before the High Court (). Other courts include the Commercial Court, which handles bankruptcy and insolvency; the State Administrative Court () to hear administrative law cases against the government; and the Religious Court () to deal with codified Islamic personal law (&quot;sharia&quot;) cases. Additionally, the Judicial Commission () monitors the performance of judges.

==Foreign relations==

During the regime of president Suharto, Indonesia built strong relations with the United States and had difficult relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China owing to Indonesia&#x27;s anti-communist policies and domestic tensions with the Chinese community. It received international denunciation for its annexation of East Timor and the related genocide against the East Timorese in 1978. Indonesia is a founding member of the Association of South East Asian Nations, and thereby a member of both ASEAN+3 and the East Asia Summit.

Since the 1980s, Indonesia has worked to develop close political and economic ties between Southeast Asian countries, and is also influential in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Indonesia was heavily criticised between 1975 and 1999 for allegedly suppressing human rights in East Timor, and for supporting violence against the East Timorese following the latter&#x27;s secession and independence in 1999. Since 2001, the government of Indonesia has co-operated with the US in cracking down on Islamic fundamentalism and terrorist groups.

<text>The economy of Indonesia is a mixed economy with dirigiste characteristics, and it is one of the emerging market economies in the world and the largest in Southeast Asia. As an upper-middle income country and member of the G20, Indonesia is classified as a newly industrialized country. Indonesia nominal GDP reached 22.139 quadrillion rupiah in 2024, it is the 16th largest economy in the world by nominal GDP and the 8th largest in terms of GDP (PPP). Indonesia&#x27;s internet economy reached US$77 billion in 2022, and is expected to cross the US$130 billion mark by 2025. Indonesia depends on the domestic market and government budget spending and its ownership of state-owned enterprises (the central government owns 141 enterprises). The administration of prices of a range of basic goods (including rice and electricity) also plays a significant role in Indonesia&#x27;s market economy. However, micro, medium and small companies contribute around 61.7% of the economy and significant major private owned companies and foreign companies are also present.

In the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the government took custody of a significant portion of private sector assets through the acquisition of nonperforming bank loans and corporate assets through the debt restructuring process, and the companies in custody were sold for privatization several years later. Since 1999, the economy has recovered, and growth accelerated to over 4–6% in the early 2000s. In 2012, Indonesia was the second fastest-growing G-20 economy, behind China, and the annual growth rate fluctuated around 5% in the following years. Indonesia faced a recession in 2020 when the economic growth collapsed to −2.07% due to the COVID-19 pandemic, its worst economic performance since the 1997 crisis.

In 2022, gross domestic product expanded by 5.31%, due to the removal of COVID-19 restrictions as well as record-high exports driven by stronger commodity prices.

Indonesia is predicted to be the 4th largest economy in the world by 2045. Joko Widodo (Jokowi) has stated that his cabinet&#x27;s calculations showed that by 2045, Indonesia will have a population of 309 million people. By Jokowi&#x27;s estimate, there would be economic growth of 5−6% and GDP of US$9.1 trillion. Indonesia&#x27;s income per capita is expected to reach US$29,000.

==History==
===Sukarno era===
In the years immediately following the proclamation of Indonesian independence, both the Japanese occupation and the conflict between Dutch and Republican forces had crippled the country&#x27;s production, with exports of commodities such as rubber and oil being reduced to 12 and 5% of their pre-WW2 levels, respectively. The first Republican government-controlled bank, the Indonesian State Bank (&quot;Bank Negara Indonesia&quot;, BNI) was founded on 5 July 1946. It initially acted as the manufacturer and distributor of ORI (&quot;Oeang Republik Indonesia&quot;/Money of the Republic of Indonesia), a currency issued by the Republican Government which was the predecessor of Rupiah. Despite this, currency issued during the Japanese occupation and by Dutch authorities was still in circulation, and the simplicity of the ORI made its counterfeiting relatively easy, worsening matters. Between 1949 and 1960, Indonesia experienced several economic disruptions. The country&#x27;s independence recognized by the Netherlands, the dissolution of the United States of Indonesia in 1950, the subsequent liberal democracy period, the nationalization of &quot;De Javasche Bank&quot; into the modern Bank Indonesia, and the takeover of Dutch corporate assets following the West New Guinea dispute, which all resulted in the devaluation of Dutch banknotes into half their value.

During the guided democracy era in the 1960s, the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability. The government was inexperienced in implementing macroeconomic policies, which resulted in severe poverty and hunger. By the time of Sukarno&#x27;s downfall in the mid-1960s, the economy was in chaos with 1,000% annual inflation, shrinking export revenues, crumbling infrastructure, factories operating at minimal capacity, and negligible investment. Nevertheless, Indonesia&#x27;s post-1960 economic improvement was considered remarkable when taking into consideration how few indigenous Indonesians in the 1950s had received a formal education under Dutch colonial policies.

===New Order===
Following President Sukarno&#x27;s downfall, the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down, stabilized the currency, rescheduled foreign debt, and attracted foreign aid and investment. (See Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia and Berkeley Mafia). Indonesia was until recently Southeast Asia&#x27;s only member of OPEC, and the 1970s oil price rise provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates, averaging over 7% from 1968 to 1981.

With high levels of regulation and dependence on declining oil prices, growth slowed to an average of 4.5% per annum between 1981 and 1988. A range of economic reforms was introduced in the late 1980s, including a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness, and deregulation of the financial sector. Foreign investment flowed into Indonesia, particularly into the rapidly developing export-oriented manufacturing sector, and from 1989 to 1997, the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7%. GDP per capita grew 545% from 1970 to 1980 as a result of the sudden increase in oil export revenues from 1973 to 1979. High levels of economic growth masked several structural weaknesses in the economy. It came at a high cost in terms of weak and corrupt governmental institutions, severe public indebtedness through mismanagement of the financial sector, rapid depletion of natural resources, and culture of favors and corruption in the business elite.

Corruption particularly gained momentum in the 1990s, reaching to the highest levels of the political hierarchy as Suharto became the most corrupt leader according to Transparency International. As a result, the legal system was weak, and there was no effective way to enforce contracts, collect debts, or sue for bankruptcy. Banking practices were very unsophisticated, with collateral-based lending the norm and widespread violation of prudential regulations, including limits on connected lending. Non-tariff barriers, rent-seeking by state-owned enterprises, domestic subsidies, barriers to domestic trade and export restrictions all created economic distortions.

The 1997 Asian financial crisis that began to affect Indonesia became an economic and political crisis. The initial response was to float the rupiah, raise key domestic interest rates, and tighten fiscal policy. In October 1997, Indonesia and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached an agreement on an economic reform program aimed at macroeconomic stabilization and the elimination of some of the country&#x27;s most damaging economic policies, such as the National Car Program and the clove monopoly, both involving family members of Suharto. The rupiah remained weak, however, and Suharto was forced to resign in May 1998 after massive riots erupted. In August 1998, Indonesia and the IMF agreed on an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) under President B. J. Habibie that included significant structural reform targets. President Abdurrahman Wahid took office in October 1999, and Indonesia and the IMF signed another EFF in January 2000. The new program also has a range of economic, structural reform, and governance targets.

The effects of the crisis were severe. By November 1997, rapid currency depreciation had seen public debt reach US$60 billion, imposing severe strains on the government&#x27;s budget. In 1998, real GDP contracted by 13.1%, and the economy reached its low point in mid-1999 with 0.8% real GDP growth. Inflation reached 72% in 1998 but slowed to 2% in 1999. The rupiah, which had been in the RP 2,600/USD1 range at the start of August 1997 fell to 11,000/USD1 by January 1998, with spot rates around 15,000 for brief periods during the first half of 1998. It returned to the 8,000/USD1 range at the end of 1998 and has generally traded in the Rp 8,000–10,000/USD1 range ever since, with fluctuations that are relatively predictable and gradual. However, the rupiah began devaluing past 11,000 in 2013, and as of November 2016 is around 13,000 Rp/USD1.

===Reform era===
Since an inflation target was introduced in 2000, the GDP deflator and the CPI have grown at an average annual pace of 10¾% and 9%, respectively, similar to the pace recorded in the two decades prior to the 1997 crisis, but well below the pace in the 1960s and 1970s. Inflation has also generally trended lower through the 2000s, with some of the fluctuations in inflation reflecting government policy initiatives such as the changes in fiscal subsidies in 2005 and 2008, which caused large temporary spikes in CPI growth.


In late 2004, Indonesia faced a &#x27;mini-crisis&#x27; due to international oil prices rises and imports. The currency exchange rate reached Rp 12,000/USD1 before stabilizing. Under President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY), the government was forced to cut its massive fuel subsidies, which were planned to cost $14 billion in October 2005. This led to a more than doubling in the price of consumer fuels, resulting in double-digit inflation. The situation had stabilized but the economy continued to struggle with inflation at 17% in late 2005. Economic outlook became more positive as the 2000s progressed. Growth accelerated to 5.1% in 2004 and reached 5.6% in 2005. Real per capita income has reached fiscal levels in 1996–1997. Growth was driven primarily by domestic consumption, which accounts for roughly three-fourths of Indonesia&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP). The Jakarta Stock Exchange was the best performing market in Asia in 2004, up by 42%. Problems that continue to put a drag on growth include low foreign investment levels, bureaucratic red tape, and widespread corruption which costs RP. 51.4 trillion (US$5.6 billion) or approximately 1.4% of GDP annually. However, there is a robust economic optimism due to the conclusion of the peaceful 2004 elections.

As of February 2007, the unemployment rate was 9.75%. Despite a slowing global economy, Indonesia&#x27;s economic growth accelerated to a ten-year high of 6.3% in 2007. This growth rate was sufficient to reduce poverty from 17.8% to 16.6% based on the government&#x27;s poverty line and reversed the recent trend towards jobless growth, with unemployment falling to 8.46% in February 2008. Unlike many of its more export-dependent neighbors, Indonesia has managed to skirt the recession helped by strong domestic demand (which makes up about two-thirds of the economy) and a government fiscal stimulus package of about 1.4% of GDP. After India and China, Indonesia was the third-fastest growing economy in the G20. With the $512 billion economy expanded 4.4% in the first quarter from a year earlier and last month, the IMF revised its 2009 Indonesia forecast to 3–4% from 2.5%. Indonesia enjoyed stronger fundamentals with the authorities implemented wide-ranging economic and financial reforms, including a rapid reduction in public and external debt, strengthening of corporate and banking sector balance sheets and reducing bank vulnerabilities through higher capitalization and better supervision.

In 2012, Indonesia&#x27;s real GDP growth reached 6%, then it steadily decreased below 5% until 2015. After Joko Widodo succeeded SBY, the government took measures to ease regulations for foreign direct investments to stimulate the economy. Indonesia managed to increase their GDP growth slightly above 5% in 2016–2017. However, the government is currently still facing problems such as currency weakening, decreasing exports and stagnating consumer spending. The current unemployment rate for 2019 is at 5.3%.

Reform happened in Indonesia around the 1980s, when the Indonesian government states it will be attempting to economically integrate with global economies. They stated in 2017 that &quot;Globalisation has made it difficult for the Indonesian economy to balance all other factors of the economy&quot;.

Indonesia’s economy in 2023, as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at current market prices, reached IDR 20,892.4 trillion. The highest growth on the production side was Transportation and Storage at 13.96%. During 2023, the Indonesian economy continued to grow spatially. The group of provinces according to the islands, the provinces with the highest growth were Maluku and Papua, Sulawesi, and Kalimantan with growth (c-to-c) of 6.94%, 6.37% and 5.43%. Meanwhile, the group of provinces on Jawa Island which contributed 57.05% to the national economy recorded a growth of 4.96% (c-to-c).

===Composition===

==Sectors==
===Agriculture===

Agriculture is a key sector which contributed to 14.43% of GDP. Currently, there are around 30% of the land area used for agriculture and employed about 49 million people (41% of the total workforce). Primary agriculture commodities include rice, cassava (tapioca), peanuts, natural rubber, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, copra; poultry, beef, pork, and eggs. Palm oil production is vital to the economy as Indonesia is the world&#x27;s biggest producer and consumer of the commodity, providing about half of the world&#x27;s supply. Plantations in the country stretch across 6 million hectares as of 2007, with a replanting plan set for an additional 4.7 million to boost productivity in 2017. There are a number of negative social and environmental impacts of palm oil production in Southeast Asia.

====Seafood====
In 2015, the total production of seafood reached about 22.31 million metric tons, valued at around 18.10 billion US dollars. For capture of wild fish (both inland and marine), the production trend was steady in 2011–2015, while there was a steep increase in the production from aquaculture during the same period.

===Oil and mining===

Indonesia was the only South East Asian member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) until its suspension in 2009. The country currently remains a net oil importer despite its large petroleum production industry. In 1999, crude and condensate output averaged per day, and in 1998, the oil and gas sector including refining, contributed approximately 9% to GDP. As of 2005, crude oil and condensate output were per day. It indicates a substantial decline from the 1990s, due primarily to ageing oil fields and a lack of investment in oil production equipment. This decline in production has been accompanied by a substantial increase in domestic consumption, about 5.4% per year, leading to an estimated US$1.2 billion cost for importing oil in 2005. The state owns all petroleum and mineral rights. Foreign firms participate through production-sharing and work contracts. Oil and gas contractors are required to finance all exploration, production, and development costs in their contract areas and are entitled to recover operating, exploration, and development costs out of the oil and gas produced. Indonesia had previously subsidized fuel prices to keep prices low, costing US$7 billion in 2004. SBY has mandated a significant reduction of government subsidy of fuel prices in several stages. The government has stated that cuts in subsidies are aimed at reducing the budget deficit to 1% of GDP in 2005, down from around 1.6% last year. At the same time, the government has offered one-time subsidies for qualified citizens, to alleviate hardships.

Indonesia is the world&#x27;s largest tin market. Although mineral production traditionally centered on bauxite, silver, and tin, it is expanding its copper, nickel, gold, and coal output for export markets. In mid-1993, the Department of Mines and Energy reopened the coal sector to foreign investment, resulting in a joint venture between Indonesian coal producer and BP and Rio Tinto Group. Total coal production reached 74 million metric tons in 1999, including exports of 55 million tons, and in 2011, production was 353 million. As of 2014, Indonesia is the third-largest producer with a total output of 458 Mt and export of 382 Mt. At this rate, the reserves will be used up in 61 years until 2075. Not all of the productions can be exported due to Domestic Market Obligation (DMO) regulation, which should fulfill the domestic market. In 2012, the DMO was 24.72%. Starting from 2014, no low-grade coal exports are allowed, so the upgraded brown coal process that cranks up the calorie value of coal from 4,500 to 6,100 kcal/kg will be built in South Kalimantan and South Sumatra. Indonesia is also the world&#x27;s largest producer of nickel, and the second-largest producer of cobalt in 2022.

Two US firms operate three copper/gold mines in Indonesia, with a Canadian and British firm holding significant other investments in nickel and gold, respectively. India&#x27;s fortune groups like Vedanta Resources and Tata Group also have substantial mining operations in Indonesia. In 1998, the value of Indonesian gold and copper production was $1 billion and $843 million respectively. Receipts from gold, copper, and coal accounted for 84% of the $3 billion earned in 1998 by the mineral mining sector. With the addition of Alumina project that produces 5% of the world&#x27;s alumina production, Indonesia would be the world&#x27;s second-largest Alumina producer. The project will not make the ores to become aluminum, as there are 100 types of Alumina derivatives that can be developed further by other companies in Indonesia.

Joko Widodo&#x27;s administration continued the resource nationalism policy of SBY, nationalizing some assets controlled by multinational companies such as Freeport McMoRan, TotalEnergies and Chevron. In 2018, in a move aimed to cut imports, oil companies operating in Indonesia were ordered to sell their crude oil to state-owned Pertamina.

===Manufacturing===

Indonesia&#x27;s manufacturing sector has historically played a key role in the country&#x27;s economic development and now contributes to 20 percent of GDP.
The government has ambitious plans to propel the country into the top ten biggest economies in the world by 2030, with manufacturing at the heart of this goal. The main areas of production include textiles and garments, food and beverages (F&amp;B), electronics, automotive, and chemicals, with the majority of manufacturers in this sector consisting of micro, small, or medium-sized enterprises. The sector has posted a consistent four percent growth year-on-year since 2016 and registered 147 trillion rupiah (US$8.9 billion) in investments from January to September 2019.

Indonesia recently became the 10th-largest manufacturing nation in the world. Its large manufacturing sector accounts for almost a quarter of the nation&#x27;s total GDP and employs over a fifth of Indonesia&#x27;s working age population (around 25 million workers). Put into perspective, Indonesia&#x27;s manufacturing sector is now larger than the manufacturing sectors of the United Kingdom, Russia and Mexico. Industry sector (including manufacturing) which accounts for 21% of local workers (having become more prominent in recent years). Indonesia&#x27;s labour pool is estimated at 120 million people, and is growing annually by approximately 2.4 million. As the economy has progressed beyond its predominantly agricultural base to a mixed composition, more workers – particularly women – are now employed in manufacturing and service-related professional industries.

With its rapidly growing middle class and competitive workforce, more foreign investors than ever before are taking advantage of Indonesia&#x27;s strong manufacturing sector. However, the sector has significant challenges, including intense international competition, particularly from China, increasing labour costs, high transportation and logistics costs, difficulties getting credit, and varying levels of transparency and clarity in regulations.

=== Renewable energy ===

Indonesia has significant potential for developing renewable energy, however, the country continues to rely heavily on the use of fossil fuels in domestic electricity production. Continued investment in and reliance on fossil fuels, such as coal, may result in fossil fuels becoming stranded assets, leading to significant investments lost that the country could have received from renewable energy investors.

===Automotive industry===
In 2010, Indonesia sold 7.6 million motorcycles, which were mainly produced in the country with almost 100% local components. Honda led the market with a 50.95% market share, followed by Yamaha with 41.37%. In 2011, the retail car sales total was 888,335 units, a 19.26% increase from last year. Toyota dominated the domestic car market (35.34%), followed by Daihatsu and Mitsubishi with 15.44% and 14.56%, respectively. Since 2011, some local carmakers have introduced some Indonesian national cars which can be categorized as Low-Cost Green Car (LCGC). In 2012, sales increased significantly by 24%, making it the first time that there were more than one million units in automobile sales.
In August 2014, Indonesia exported 126,935 Completely Build Up (CBU) vehicle units and 71,000 Completely Knock Down (CKD) vehicle units, while total production reached 878,000 vehicle units, constituting 22.5% of total output. Automotive export is more than double of its import. By 2020, it is predicted that the automotive exports will be the third after CPO and shoe export. In August 2015, Indonesia exported 123,790 motorcycles. In the same year, Yamaha Motor Company, which exported 82,641, announced to make Indonesia as a base of exporting of its products.

In 2017, the country produced almost 1.2 million motor vehicles, ranking it as the 18th largest producer in the world. Nowadays, Indonesian automotive companies can produce cars with a high ratio of local content (80%–90%).

In 2018, the country produced 1.34 million cars and exported 346,000 cars, mainly to the Philippines and Vietnam.

===Finance, real estate and business===

There are 50 million small businesses in Indonesia, with online usage growth of 48% in 2010. Google announced that it would open a local office in Indonesia before 2012. According to Deloitte in 2011, Internet-related activities have generated 1.6% of the GDP. It is bigger than electronic and electrical equipment exports and liquefied natural gas at 1.51% and 1.45% respectively.

Up to the end of June 2011, the fixed state assets were Rp 1,265 trillion ($128 billion). The value of state stocks was Rp 50 trillion ($5 billion) while other state assets were Rp 24 trillion ($2.4 billion).

In 2015, financial services covered Rp 7,2 trillion. Fifty domestic and foreign conglomerations held around 70.5%. Fourteen of it were vertical conglomerations, 28 were horizontal, and eight are mixed. Thirty-five entities are mainly in the bank industries, 13 were in non-bank industries and one each in special financial industries and capital market industries.

===Others===
The Indonesian Textile Association has reported that in 2013, the textile sector is likely to attract investment of around $175 million. In 2012, the investment in this sector was $247 million, of which only $51 million was for new textile machinery. Exports from the textile sector in 2012 were $13.7 billion.

In 2011, Indonesia released 55,010 working visas for foreigners, an increase of 10% compared to 2010, while the number of foreign residents in Indonesia, excluding tourists and foreign emissaries was 111,752, rose by 6% compared to last year. Those who received visas for six months to one year were mostly Chinese, Japanese, South Koreans, Indians, Americans and Australians. A few of them were entrepreneurs who made new businesses. Malaysia is the most common destination of Indonesian migrant workers (including illegal workers). In 2010, according to a World Bank report, Indonesia was among the world&#x27;s top ten remittance-receiving countries with a value totaling $7 billion. In May 2011, six million Indonesian citizens were working overseas, 2.2 million of whom reside in Malaysia and another 1.5 million in Saudi Arabia.

==Regional economies==

===GDP by provinces===

There are 34 provinces in Indonesia. Below are the top 15 provinces in Indonesia ranked by GDP in 2019:
==Foreign economic relations==
=== Trade statistics ===
===ASEAN===
Until the end of 2010, intra-ASEAN trade was still low as trade involved mainly exports to countries outside the region, with the exception of Laos and Myanmar, whose foreign trade was ASEAN-oriented. In 2009, realised foreign direct investment (FDI) was US$37.9 billion and increased two-fold in 2010 to US$75.8 billion.

The ASEAN Framework Agreement on Trade in Services (AFAS) was adopted at the ASEAN Summit in Bangkok in December 1995. Under the agreement, member states enter into successive rounds of negotiations to liberalise trade in services with the aim of submitting increasingly higher levels of commitment. ASEAN has concluded seven packages of commitments under AFAS.

Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) have been agreed upon by ASEAN for eight professions: physicians, dentists, nurses, architects, engineers, accountants, surveyors, and tourism professionals. Individuals in these professions will be free to work in any ASEAN states effective 31 December 2015.

In addition, six member states (Malaysia, Vietnam (2 exchanges), Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore) have collaborated on integrating their stock exchanges, which includes 70% of its transaction values with the goal to compete with international exchanges.

Single market will also include the ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASEAN-SAM), the region&#x27;s aviation policy geared towards the development of a unified and single aviation market in Southeast Asia. It was proposed by the ASEAN Air Transport Working Group, supported by the ASEAN Senior Transport Officials Meeting, and endorsed by the ASEAN Transport Ministers. It is expected to liberalise air travel between member states allowing ASEAN airlines to benefit directly from the growth in air travel, and also free up tourism, trade, investment, and service flows. This policy supersedes existing unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral air services agreements among member states which are inconsistent with its provisions.

===Japan===
Indonesia and Japan signed the Indonesia–Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (IJEPA), which had come into effect on 1 July 2008. The agreement was Indonesia&#x27;s first bilateral free-trade agreement to ease the cross-border flow of goods and people as well as investment between both countries. In 2012, there were between 1,200 and 1,300 Japanese corporates operating in Indonesia, with some 12,000 Japanese nationals living in Indonesia. Japan has been investing in Indonesia for decades, particularly in the automotive, electronic goods, energy, and mining sectors. Prior to the formation of the Indonesian Republic, the Japanese had viewed Indonesia as an important source of natural resources. The Japanese need of natural resources was among the reasons that led the nation to advance further to the south in their military conquests during World War II. Today Indonesia is Japan&#x27;s major supplier for natural rubber, liquefied natural gas, coal, minerals, paper pulp, seafood such as shrimp and tuna, and coffee. Traditionally Indonesia has been regarded as a major market of Japanese automotive and electronic goods. For Japanese businesses, Indonesia has been a location for low-cost manufacturing operations as well as being the source of various natural resources required by those operations. Approximately 1,000 Japanese companies operate in Indonesia which employ approximately 300,000 people. Major Japanese factories are concentrated east of Jakarta with high concentrations in Bekasi, Cikarang and Karawang, West Java.

===China===
Trade with China has increased since the 1990s, and in 2014, China became Indonesia&#x27;s second-largest export destination after Japan. Trade between China and Indonesia is on the rise, especially after the implementation of ACFTA since early 2010. Indeed, while in 2003 trade between Indonesia and China reached only US$3.8 billion, in 2010 it multiplied almost 10 times and reached US$36.1 billion. China&#x27;s transformation into Fastest growing country in the 21st century has led to an increase of foreign investments in the bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties. However the free trade with China has caused much anxiety in Indonesia, since inflows of cheap products from China could harm Indonesian industry. Indonesian private sector and civil society organizations vigorously lobbied the Indonesian government and members of parliament, insisting that Indonesia should either pull out of the agreement or renegotiate its terms with Beijing.

China has remained on top of Indonesia&#x27;s key major trading partners, serving as the country&#x27;s largest export and import market. China serves as Indonesia&#x27;s largest export destination after overtaking Japan and United States, reaching US$16.8 billion. China is also Indonesia&#x27;s most important source of imports, reaching US$30.8 billion, or 22.7% of Indonesian imports in 2016. The balance however was in favour of China as Indonesia booked a trade deficit of US$14 billion in 2016.

From China&#x27;s perspective, since 2010 ASEAN as a whole has become its fourth-largest trading partner after the European Union, Japan and the United States. Among ASEAN member countries, Indonesia was China&#x27;s fourth-largest trading partner, which, according to data as of May 2010 from the Ministry of Commerce of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, amounted to US$12.4 billion, after Malaysia (US$22.2 billion), Singapore (US$17.9 billion) and Thailand (US$15.7 billion). With China&#x27;s economic rise, Indonesia has been intensifying its trade relationship with China to counterbalance its ties with the West. By 2020, China had become Indonesia&#x27;s largest export destination.

===South Korea===
In the past, the relations were only developed around trade and investments, such as the forestry and garment sectors. Today the cooperation has been expanded to a number of mega projects and advanced industries. With US$27 billion in bilateral trade, South Korea became the fourth biggest trading partner of Indonesia in 2012. It became the third-biggest foreign investor in Indonesia, with US$1.94 billion in investment.

There are large numbers of South Korean companies that have been investing and operating in Indonesia, such as Miwon (Daesang Corporation), Lotte, Yong Ma, Hankook, Samsung, LG, Kia Motors and Hyundai. In 2011, Hankook announced a US$353 million investment into a production plant located in Bekasi, West Java, Indonesia.

In 2019, trade between Indonesia and South Korea was worth $15.65 billion, and between 2015 and 2019 South Korean companies invested nearly $7 billion in Indonesia. In December 2020, Indonesia and South Korea signed a comprehensive economic partnership. It is equivalent to a free trade agreement, though focuses on a broader scope of economic cooperation. Under the deal, Indonesia will scrap 94.8% of tariffs on South Korean products while South Korea will scrap 95.8% of tariffs on Indonesian products.

===United States===
At the beginning of the post-Suharto era, US exports to Indonesia in 1999 totaled $2 billion, down significantly from $4.5 billion in 1997. The main exports were construction equipment, machinery, aviation parts, chemicals, and agricultural products. US imports from Indonesia in 1999 totaled $9.5 billion and consisted primarily of clothing, machinery and transportation equipment, petroleum, natural rubber, and footwear. Financial assistance to Indonesia is coordinated through the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI) formed in 1989. It includes 19 donor countries and 13 international organizations that meet annually to coordinate donor assistance. In 2019, as Indonesia&#x27;s share of global trade exceeded 0.5 percent, the United States Trade Representatives decided not to classify Indonesia as a &quot;developing country.&quot; Despite a revocation of this status, the Indonesian government has assured that this would not change the current Generalized System of Preferences facilities that Indonesia had enjoyed from the United States.

===European Union===
The EU and Indonesia have built robust commercial relations, with bilateral trade amounting to approximately €25 billion in 2012 resulting in a sizeable €5.7 billion trade surplus for Indonesia with the EU. In the past few years trade between EU and Indonesia has been marked by an upward trend. Whereas total trade was worth almost €16 billion in 2009, by 2011 it had already reached €23.5 billion. For the EU, Indonesia is the 24th largest import source (share 0.9%) and the 30th largest export destination (share 0.6%). Inside the ASEAN-region, Indonesia ranks fourth in terms of total trade. The EU is Indonesia&#x27;s 4th largest trading partner after Japan, China and Singapore, representing almost 10% of its total external trade. The EU is the second largest investor in the Indonesian economy.
Indonesia mostly exports to the EU agricultural products and processed resources, mainly palm oil, fuels and mining products, textiles and furniture. EU exports to Indonesia consist mainly of high-tech machinery and transport equipment, chemicals and various manufactured goods. Essentially, trade flows between Indonesia and the EU complement each other.
After negotiations on a free trade agreement with ASEAN got increasingly difficult, the EU began pursuing negotiations with individual ASEAN states. The EU and Indonesia are currently working towards an ambitious Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement covering trade, investment and services.

===India===
On 25 January 2011, after talks by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and visiting President of Indonesia Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, India and Indonesia had signed business deals worth billions of dollars and set an ambitious target of doubling trade over the next five years. India also has further economic ties with Indonesia through its free trade agreement with ASEAN, of which Indonesia is a member. The two countries target to achieve bilateral trade of $25 billion by 2015, with cumulative Indian investments of $20 billion in Indonesia.

==Macro-economic trend==
This is a chart of trend of Indonesia&#x27;s GDP at market prices by the IMF with figures in millions of rupiah.
For purchasing power parity comparisons, the exchange rate for 1 US dollar is set at 3,094.57 rupiah.

Average net wage in Indonesia varies by sector. In February 2017 the electricity, gas, and water sector has the highest average net wage, while the agriculture sector has the lowest.

==Investment==
Since the late 1980s, Indonesia has made significant changes to its regulatory framework to encourage economic growth. This growth was financed mostly from private investment, both foreign and domestic. US investors dominated the oil and gas sector and undertook some of Indonesia&#x27;s largest mining projects. In addition, the presence of US banks, manufacturers, and service providers expanded, especially after the industrial and financial sector reforms of the 1980s. Other major foreign investors included India, Japan, the UK, Singapore, the Netherlands, Qatar, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea.

The 1997 crisis made continued private financing imperative but problematic. New foreign investment approvals fell by almost two-thirds between 1997 and 1999. The crisis further highlighted areas where additional reform was needed. Frequently cited areas for improving the investment climate were the establishment of a functioning legal and judicial system, adherence to competitive processes, and adoption of internationally acceptable accounting and disclosure standards. Despite improvements of laws in recent years, Indonesia&#x27;s intellectual property rights regime remains weak, and lack of effective enforcement is a significant concern. Under Suharto, Indonesia had moved towards the private provision of public infrastructure, including electric power, toll roads, and telecommunications. The 1997 crisis brought to light a severe weakness in the process of dispute resolution, however, particularly in the area of private infrastructure projects. Although Indonesia continued to have the advantages of a large labour force, abundant natural resources and modern infrastructure, private investment in new projects largely ceased during the crisis.

As of 28 June 2010, the Indonesia Stock Exchange had 341 listed companies with a combined market capitalization of $269.9 billion. As of November 2010, two-thirds of the market capitalization was in the form of foreign funds, and only around 1% of the population have stock investments. Efforts are further being made to improve the business and investment environment. Within the World Bank&#x27;s Doing Business Survey, Indonesia rose to 122 out of 178 countries in 2010, from 129 in the previous year. Despite these efforts, the rank is still below regional peers, and an unfavorable investment climate persists. For example, potential foreign investors and their executive staff cannot maintain their own bank accounts in Indonesia, unless they are tax-paying local residents (paying tax in Indonesia for their worldwide income).

From 1990 to 2010, Indonesian companies have been involved in 3,757 mergers and acquisitions as either acquirer or target with a total known value of $137 billion. In 2010, 609 transactions were announced, which is a new record. Numbers had increased by 19% compared to 2009. The value of deals in 2010 was US$17 billion, which is the second-highest number ever. In 2012, Indonesia realized total investments of $32.5 billion, surpassing its annual target $25 billion, as reported by Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) on 22 January. The primary investments were in the mining, transport and chemicals sectors. In 2011, the Indonesian government announced a new &quot;Masterplan&quot; (known as the &quot;MP3EI&quot;, or &quot;Masterplan Percepatan dan Perluasan Pembangunan Ekonomi Indonesia&quot;, the &quot;Masterplan to Accelerate and Expand Economic Development in Indonesia&quot;). The aim was to encourage increased investment, particularly in infrastructure projects across Indonesia.

Indonesia regained its investment grade rating from Fitch Rating in late 2011, and from Moody&#x27;s Rating in early 2012, after losing it in the 1997 crisis, during which Indonesia spent more than Rp. 450 trillion ($50 billion) to bail out lenders from banks. Fitch raised Indonesia&#x27;s long-term and local currency debt rating to BBB− from BB+ with both ratings is stable. Fitch also predicted that the economy would grow at least 6% on average per year through 2013, despite a less conducive global economic climate. Moody&#x27;s raised Indonesia&#x27;s foreign and local currency bond ratings to Baa3 from Ba1 with a stable outlook. In May 2017, S&amp;P Global raised Indonesia&#x27;s investment grade from BB+ to BBB− with a stable outlook, due to the economy experiencing a rebound in exports and strong consumer spending during early 2017.

===Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)===
Indonesia&#x27;s foreign direct investment surged 44.2% on a yearly basis in 2022, with the base metals sector drawing in the biggest inflows. Indonesia&#x27;s received 654.4 trillion rupiah worth of FDI last year, or equivalent to $45.6 billion in the investment ministry&#x27;s official calculation, which assumes an exchange rate of 14,350 to the dollar. The data excludes investment in the banking and oil and gas sectors. Foreign direct investment in base metals and mining reached $11 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, last year, the biggest recipients of FDI. The biggest sources were Singapore, China and Hong Kong. Total investment, including from domestic sources, reached 1,207.2 trillion rupiah ($81.02 billion), roughly in line with the government&#x27;s target. FDI in the final quarter of last year was up 43.3% on an annual basis, amounting to 175.2 trillion rupiah in rupiah terms, or $12.2 billion in the official U.S. dollar equivalent.

List of the 10 largest foreign investment origin countries in Indonesia :

Foreign direct investment into Indonesia (excluding investment in banking and the oil and gas sectors) increased 20.2 percent year-on-year to a new record peak of IDR 177 trillion (US$11.96 billion) in the Q1 of 2023, amid efforts by the government to ease business and licensing rules. Singapore (US$4.3 billion) was the biggest source of investment, followed by Hong Kong (US$1.5 billion), China (US$1.2 billion), and Japan (US$1 billion) while base metals were the biggest recipient amid efforts to boost investment in processed minerals. In total, Indonesia recorded IDR 328.9 trillion of foreign and domestic investment during the first quarter, up 16.5 percent from a year earlier, boosted by a rise in investment in base metals, transportation, and the mining sector. For 2023, the government has set a target to draw IDR 1,400 trillion (US$95.5 billion) of investment from domestic and foreign sources.

Indonesia has 1 company that rank in the Fortune Global 500 ranking for 2023.
=== Forbes Global 2000 ===
Indonesia has 9 companies that rank in the Forbes Global 2000 ranking for 2024.


==Public expenditure==
In 2015, total public spending was Rp 1,806 trillion (US$130.88 billion, 15.7% of GDP). Government revenues, including those from state-owned enterprises (BUMN), totaled Rp 1,508 trillion (US$109.28 billion, 13.1% of GDP) resulting in a deficit of 2.6%. Since the 1997 crisis that caused an increase in debt and public subsidies and a decrease in development spending, Indonesia&#x27;s public finances have undergone a major transformation. As a result of a series macroeconomic policies, including a low budget deficit, Indonesia is considered to have moved into a situation of financial resources sufficiency to address development needs. Decentralization, enacted during the Habibie administration, has changed the manner of government spending, which has resulted in around 40% of public funds being transferred to regional governments by 2006.

In 2005, rising international oil prices led to the government&#x27;s decision of slashing fuel subsidies. It led to an extra US$10 billion for government spending on development, and by 2006, there were an additional 5 billion due to steady growth, and declining debt service payments. It was the country&#x27;s first &quot;fiscal space&quot; since the revenue windfall during the 1970s oil boom. Due to decentralization and fiscal space, Indonesia has the potential to improve the quality of its public services. Such potential also enables the country to focus on further reforms, such as the provision of targeted infrastructure. Careful management of allocated funds has been described as Indonesia&#x27;s main issue in public expenditure.

In 2018, President Joko Widodo substantially increased the amount of debt by taking foreign loans. Indonesia has increased the debt by Rp 1,815 trillion compared to his predecessor, SBY. He has insisted that the loan is used for productive long-term projects such as building roads, bridges, and airports. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani also stated that despite an increase of foreign loans and debt, the government has also increased the budget for infrastructure development, healthcare, education, and budget given to regencies and villages. The government is insisting that foreign debt is still under control, and complying with relevant laws that limit debt to be under 60% of GDP.

==Regional performance==
Based on the regional administration implementation performance evaluation of 2009, by order, the best performance were:
* 3 provinces: North Sulawesi, South Sulawesi, and Central Java;

==Wealth==

===National net wealth===
National net wealth, also known as national net worth, is the total sum of the value of a nation&#x27;s assets minus its liabilities. It refers to the total value of net wealth possessed by the citizens of a nation at a set point in time. This figure is an important indicator of a nation&#x27;s ability to take on debt and sustain spending and is influenced not only by real estate prices, equity market prices, exchange rates, liabilities and incidence in a country of the adult population but also by human resources, natural resources and capital and technological advancements, which may create new assets or render others worthless in the future. According to Credit Suisse, Indonesia has national net wealth of approximately $3.199 trillion, or about 0.765% of world net wealth, placing Indonesia at 17th, above Russia, Brazil, and Sweden.

===High-net-worth individuals===
According to Asia Wealth Report, Indonesia has the highest growth rate of high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) predicted among the 10 largest Asian economies. The 2015 Knight Frank Wealth Report reported that in 2014 there were 24 individuals with a net worth above US$1 billion. 18 of them lived in Jakarta while the others were spread among other large cities in Indonesia. 192 persons can be categorized as centamillionaires with over US$100 million of wealth and 650 persons as high-net-worth individuals whose wealth exceeded US$30 million.

==Challenges==
===Embezzlement and corrupt bureaucracy===

Corruption is pervasive in the Indonesian government, affecting many fields that are central to barrier the country&#x27;s economic development from local governments, the police, the private sector even various ministerial institutions which are close to the president. It is related to problems of human capacities and technical resources remains a major challenge in merging effectiveness and integrity in public administration, especially in regencies and cities. A 2018 World Economic Forum survey reports that corruption is the most problematic issue regarding doing business in Indonesia, as well as inefficient government bureaucracy policies. The survey also showed that 70% of entrepreneurs believe that corruption has grown in Indonesia, while low trust in the private sector is a major obstacle to foreign investment in the country.

In 2019, a controversial bill regarding the anti-corruption body (Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK)) reduced the commission&#x27;s effectiveness in tackling widespread corruption problems and stripped its independence was passed despite massive protests across the country. There were 26 points in the revised law that crippled the commission and might further undermine efforts to eradicate corruption in Indonesia.

===Labour unrest===
As of 2011, labour militancy was growing with a major strike at the Grasberg mine, the world&#x27;s largest gold mine as well as the second-largest copper mine, and numerous strikes elsewhere. A common issue was the attempts by foreign-owned enterprises to evade Indonesia&#x27;s strict labour laws by calling their employees&#x27; contract workers. &quot;The New York Times&quot; expressed concern that Indonesia&#x27;s cheap labor advantage might be lost. However, a large pool of the unemployed who will accept substandard wages and conditions remains available. One factor in the increase of militancy is increased awareness via the Internet of prevailing wages in other countries, and the generous profits foreign companies are making in Indonesia.

On 1 September 2015, thousands of workers in Indonesia staged large demonstrations across the country in pursuit of higher wages and improved labour laws. Approximately 35,000 people rallied in total. They demanded a 22% to 25% increase in the minimum wage by 2016 and lower prices on essential goods, including fuel. The unions also want the government to ensure job security and ensure the fundamental rights of the workers.

In 2020, thousands of workers across the country held a massive march to protest against the Omnibus Law on Job Creation that included several controversial rules, which revised minimum wages, lowered severance pay, relaxed firing rules, among other disadvantaging regulations for labors and factory workers.

===Inequality===
Economic disparity and the flow of natural resource profits to Jakarta has led to discontent and contributed to separatist movements in areas such as Aceh and Papua. Geographically, the poorest fifth regions account for just 8% of consumption, while the wealthiest fifth account for 45%. While there are new laws on decentralization that may address the problem of uneven growth and satisfaction partially, there are many hindrances in putting this new policy into practice. At a 2011 Makassar Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) meeting, Disadvantaged Regions Minister said there are 184 regencies classified as disadvantaged areas, with around 120 in eastern Indonesia. 1% of Indonesia&#x27;s population has 49.3% of the country&#x27;s $1.8 trillion wealth, down from 53.5%. However, it is ranked fourth after Russia (74.5%), India (58.4%) and Thailand (58%).

===Inflation===
Inflation has long been a problem in Indonesia. Because of political turmoil, the country once suffered hyperinflation, with 1,000% annual inflation between 1964 and 1967, resulting in severe poverty and hunger. Even though the economy recovered quickly during the first decade of the New Order administration (1970–1981), never once was the inflation less than 10% annually. The inflation slowed during the mid-1980s; however, the economy was also languid due to the decrease in oil price that reduced its export revenue dramatically. The economy was again experiencing rapid growth between 1989 and 1997 due to the improving export-oriented manufacturing sector. Still, the inflation rate was higher than economic growth, and this caused a widening gap among Indonesians. Inflation peaked in 1998 during the 1997 crisis at over 58%, causing poverty to rise to the levels of the 1960s. During the economic recovery and growth in recent years, the government has been trying to lower the inflation rate. However, it seems that inflation has been affected by global fluctuation and domestic market competition. As of 2010, the inflation rate was approximately 7%, when its economic growth was 6%. To date, inflation is affecting the Indonesian lower middle class, especially those who are not able to afford food after price hikes. At the end of 2017, Indonesia&#x27;s inflation rate was 3.61%, or higher than the government-set forecast of 3.0–3.5%.

<text>Communications in Indonesia has a complex history due to the need to reach an extended archipelago of over 17,500 islands. The once important non-electronic communication methods of the past have given way to a considerable telecommunications infrastructure in contemporary Indonesia.

== History ==
Indonesia has long been using traditional forms of communications between various islands and villages. It was not until the sixteenth century when the Dutch colonised Indonesia, constructing a more elaborate communication system, both within Indonesia and to other countries. The first connection to Australia was an undersea telegraph cable that was completed on 18 November 1871, connecting Java to Darwin, and eventually to the Australian Overland Telegraph Line across Australia.

After gaining Independence, Indonesia started to develop its own communication systems, generally following the rest of the world. The construction of communication towers and launch of the Palapa series of communication satellites was done during the New Order period.

== Infrastructure ==
A number of lines connect Indonesia to international communication routes. For example, the SEA-ME-WE 3 optical submarine telecommunications cable lands at both Medan and Jakarta connecting Europe with South eastern Asia (several countries up to Japan) and Australia (Perth).

Domestically, Indonesia has good coverage for media across most major islands, although smaller and less populated Islands do not always receive attention from media companies, and rely on satellite communication.

==Media==

=== Print ===
Indonesia has a long list of print media, in the form of newspapers and magazines. Some, such as Kompas, Media Indonesia, Koran Sindo and Koran Tempo are circulated daily and are relatively simple to obtain. Others are island- or city-specific, and are usually not distributed to other regions.

=== Telephone ===
* Telephones - main lines in use: 9.99 million (2004)
* Telephones - mobile cellular: At the end of 2010, the mobile cellular penetration rate was 67 percent (22 percent at end of 2006). CDMA use is declining in favour of GSM.
* Telephone system: domestic service fair, international service good
**domestic: interisland microwave system and HF radio police net; domestic satellite communications system
**international: satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (1 Indian Ocean and 1 Pacific Ocean)

=== Radio ===
* Radio broadcast stations: AM 678, FM 43, shortwave 82 (1998)
* Radios: 31.5 million (1997)

=== Television ===
* Television broadcast stations: 11 national TV, 60 local TV (From AC Nielsen Report - first Semester 2005):
* Televisions: 13.75 million (1997)

=== Internet ===

* Internet Service Providers (ISPs): 24 (1999)
* Country code (Top-level domain): .id

By June 2011, all sub-districts in Indonesia will be connected to the Internet.

==Regulatory environment in Indonesia==

The media in Indonesia is regulated by the Ministry of Communications and Informatics.

LIRNEasia&#x27;s Telecommunications Regulatory Environment (TRE) index, which summarises stakeholders&#x27; perception on certain TRE dimensions, provides insight into how conducive the environment is for further development and progress. The most recent survey was conducted in July 2008 in eight Asian countries, including Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines. The tool measured seven dimensions: i) market entry; ii) access to scarce resources; iii) interconnection; iv) tariff regulation; v) anti-competitive practices; and vi) universal services; vii) quality of service, for the fixed, mobile and broadband sectors.

Below-average scores received in all sectors and across dimensions reflect general dissatisfaction of the TRE in Indonesia. However, this does not mean that respondents have ignored recent developments. The relatively healthy growth in mobile sector is reflected in the higher TRE scores received by the sector for most dimensions, when compared to the fixed sector. On average, the mobile sector scores best, with fixed and broadband following.

<text>[[Indonesia]]&#x27;s transport system has been shaped over time by the economic resource base of an archipelago with thousands of islands, and the distribution of its more than 200 million people concentrated mainly on a single island, Java.

All modes of transport play a role in the country&#x27;s transport system and are generally complementary rather than competitive. Road transport is predominant, with a total system length of in 2020. The railway system has five unconnected networks in Java and Sumatra primarily dedicated to transport bulk commodities and long-distance passenger traffic.

Sea transport is extremely important for economic integration, as well as for domestic and foreign trade. It is well developed, with each of the major islands having at least one significant port city. The role of inland waterways is relatively minor and is limited to certain areas of Eastern Sumatra and Kalimantan.

The function of air transport is significant, particularly where land or water transport is deficient or non-existent. It is based on an extensive domestic airline network in which all major cities can be reached by passenger plane.

== Water transport==

===Merchant marine vessels===

Because Indonesia encompasses a sprawling archipelago, maritime shipping provides essential links between different parts of the country. Boats in common use include large container ships, a variety of ferries, passenger ships, sailing ships, and smaller motorised vessels. The traditional wooden pinisi vessel is still widely used as the inter-island freight service within Indonesian archipelago. Main pinisi traditional harbours are Sunda Kelapa in Jakarta and Paotere harbour in Makassar.

Frequent ferry services cross the straits between nearby islands, especially in the chain of islands stretching from Sumatra through Java to the Lesser Sunda Islands. On the busy crossings between Sumatra, Java, and Bali, multiple car ferries run frequently twenty-four hours per day. There are also international ferry services between across the Straits of Malacca between Sumatra and Malaysia, and between Singapore and nearby Indonesian islands, such as Batam. Ferry services are operated by state-owned ASDP Indonesia Ferry and several private operators.
A network of passenger ships makes longer connections to more remote islands, especially in the eastern part of the archipelago. The national shipping line, Pelni, provides passenger service to ports throughout the country on a two to four week schedule. These ships generally provide the least expensive way to cover long distances between islands. Smaller privately run boats provide service between islands.

On some islands, major rivers provide a key transportation link in the absence of good roads. On Kalimantan, longboats running on the rivers are the only way to reach many inland areas.

===Waterways===
Indonesia has of navigable waterways (), of which about one half are on Kalimantan, and a quarter each on Sumatra and Papua. Waterways are highly needed because the rivers on these islands are not wide enough to hold medium-sized ships. In addition to this, roads and railways are not good options since Kalimantan and Papua are not like Java, which is a highly developed island. With the current length of waterways, Indonesia ranked seventh on the countries with longest waterways.

=== Ports and harbours ===
Major ports and harbours include Bitung, Cilacap, Cirebon, Jakarta, Kupang, Palembang, Semarang, Surabaya, and Makassar. Ports are managed by the various Indonesia Port Corporations, of which there are four, numbered I through IV. Each has jurisdiction over various regions of the country, with I in the west and IV in the east. Port of Tanjung Priok in Jakarta is the Indonesia&#x27;s busiest port, handling over 5.20 million TEUs.

A two-phase &quot;New Tanjung Priok&quot; extension project is currently underway, which will triple the existing annual capacity when fully operational in 2023. In 2015, ground breaking of the strategic North Sumatra&#x27;s Kuala Tanjung Port has been completed. It is expected to accommodate 500,000 TEUs per year, overtaking Johor&#x27;s Tanjung Pelepas Port and could even compete with the port of Singapore.

==Roads and highways==
A wide variety of vehicles are used for transportation on Indonesia&#x27;s roads. Bus services are available in most areas connected to the road network. Between major cities, especially on Sumatra, Java, and Bali, services are frequent and direct; many express services are available with no stops until the final destination.

===Intercity bus===
The intercity bus service has become the major provider of land transportation service connecting Indonesian cities, either within an island or inter-island connected through ferry crossings. The intercity bus operator companies are called P.O. ( in Indonesian) with several major companies operating mainly in Java and Sumatra. The longest intercity bus service in Indonesia is a route operated by P.O. Antar Lintas Sumatera (ALS) connecting Medan in North Sumatra and Jember in East Java. It is a week long bus travel covering a distance of 2,920 kilometers.

The surge of intercity bus travel in Indonesia took place after the completion of Trans-Java highway section connecting Jakarta and Surabaya in 2018. During this time, some intercity bus services began operating fleet of double decker busses.

===City bus===

Some major cities has urban transit bus service, or a more sophisticated form of bus rapid transit (BRT). There are usually also bus services of various kinds such as the Kopaja in Jakarta. The largest one, Transjakarta system in Jakarta, is the longest bus rapid transit system in the world that boasts some in 13 corridors and 10 cross-corridor routes and carrying 430,000 passengers daily in 2016. Other cities such as Yogyakarta (Trans Jogja), Surabaya (Suroboyo Bus &amp; Trans Semanggi Suroboyo), Palembang, Bandung (Trans Metro Pasundan), Surakarta (Batik Solo Trans), Denpasar, Pekanbaru, Semarang (Trans Semarang), Makassar, Bogor, and Padang also have BRT systems in place without segregated lanes.

====City bus in Surabaya====
Surabaya City has a number of public transportation services in the form of regular city bus by several bus companies, both owned by BUMN and private, which operate in accordance with the route permit from the Surabaya City Transportation Agency or the East Java Traffic and Road Transportation Agency (DLLAJ). The service has been operating since July 20, 1975, replacing the function of tram as the main public transportation at that time.
In the early 2010s, the population of regular city buses continued to decline along with the number of units that were no longer roadworthy and the emergence of various online transportation services in this city. The existence of regular city buses has also been eroded by the start of various road-based mass transportation (bus rapid transit) services in the city since mid-2015, such as Trans Gerbangkertosila (known as Trans Sidoarjo), Suroboyo Bus, Trans Semanggi Suroboyo and Trans Jatim. Until 2017, the population of regular city buses with various chassis (frames) and bodies reached 274 units spread across twenty different route lines.
Early September 2022, the state-owned operator Perum DAMRI officially stopped all operations of its regular city buses, so that all remaining regular city bus services were only operated by several private bus companies. There are a total of 38 buses from several bus companies such as PO Estraa Mandiri, PO Ladju, PO Akas NR, PO Dua Putra, etc., which provide services on two economy routes, two express routes and one AC express route. These routes connect Terminal Purabaya or Terminal Larangan (Sidoarjo) in the south of the city with several public transportation infrastructures in the north of the city such as Terminal Bratang, Terminal Joyoboyo or Jembatan Merah Plaza (JMP).

==== History and development ====
===== Tram feeder buses =====
City bus services have been present in Surabaya as feeder buses or pick-up buses for tram passengers belonging to the Oost-Java Stoomtram Maatschappij (OJS) company since 1889. Many bus units were placed at several tram stop infrastructure such as Wonokromo Kota Station, Willemplein, and Ujung. As the golden age of trams faded, the Surabaya City Government began to stop all tram operations in 1969. As a result, tram feeder buses changed status to become the main mode of public transportation in the city.
===== Pioneer city bus of Perum DAMRI =====

After the tram operation stopped, the Surabaya City Government began a project to establish and procure regular city bus services bound to fixed routes, in collaboration with the pioneer operator Perum DAMRI. The regular city bus service by Perum DAMRI was officially launched on July 20, 1975 with twenty large buses produced by Robur. Along with the increasing public interest, Perum DAMRI began to increase the number of buses by fifty units in 1976 and 92 units in 1978. Until 1982, the city bus routes increased to nine and were served by 168 buses. The nine newest city bus routes are:
* Joyoboyo–Red Bridge via Darmo
* Joyoboyo–Red Bridge via Diponegoro
* Joyoboyo–Tanjung Perak
* Kutisari–Demak Road
* Aloha–Red Bridge
* Kutisari–Karang Menjangan
* Demak Road–Karang Menjangan
* Aloha–Heroes Monument via Darmo
* Aloha–Heroes Monument via Diponegoro.

===== Double-decker buses =====
In 1981, Perum DAMRI began operating five double-decker bus routes using buses produced by Leyland Motors. A year later, Perum DAMRI added two new routes, along with the inauguration of the patas class city bus service. By 1983, the number of double-decker bus routes had increased to ten different routes. After operating for eight years, all double-decker bus operations were stopped since 1989. One of the contributing factors was the infrastructure on arterial roads that still did not support the operation and affordability of double-decker bus transportation. All bus units belonging to the double-decker bus were finally replaced with regular buses.

===== RMB Bus =====

One form of improving regular city bus services from the Perum DAMRI operator in the early 2000s was the operation of new method route buses (RMB). The fundamental difference between RMB buses and other buses is that there are various improvements and improvements in service quality such as the addition of interior facilities, security systems, passenger capacity, departure schedules, distances between departures (&quot;headway&quot;), stopping points (stops), payment methods, crew competence, and payroll systems. The RMB bus was designed as a pilot project to improve the quality of other routes. This RMB bus is the beginning of the development of city buses with air conditioning (AC) facilities, so that later these bus units are better known as AC patas city buses.

===== AC patas bus =====

As of July 5, 2007, Perum DAMRI has begun to gradually rejuvenate regular patas class city buses using patas class units with facilities air conditioning (AC) and automatic doors. The initial stage was carried out by replacing twenty regular city buses on route P1 with city buses on route PAC1. Following on April 3, 2012, ten regular city buses on route P8 were also replaced with city buses on route PAC8.

===== Women&#x27;s bus =====

As of April 30, 2012, the Surabaya City Government in collaboration with Perum DAMRI began operating a special regular city bus service for women or called a women&#x27;s bus. The service aims to minimize cases of sexual harassment and criminal acts against women in public transportation. The number of units provided by Perum DAMRI for the service is thirteen large buses. As of July 2, 2012, the women&#x27;s bus began operating using six buses on the PAC1 route. Low passenger occupancy has resulted in the number of buses operating continuing to be reduced. Until July 13, 2012, only four women&#x27;s buses were operating. Ineffective operations and the absence of feedback in the form of evaluations and long-term plans from the Surabaya City Government caused this service to slowly stop operating. The women&#x27;s bus units began to function again as regular city buses by transporting passengers of various genders.

===== BRT Trans Sidoarjo =====

Perum DAMRI in collaboration with the Sidoarjo Regency Government inaugurated the Trans Sidoarjo service (as part of the development of the Trans Gerbang Kertasusila agglomeration transportation) with a total of thirty large buses with a high deck design (&quot;highdeck&quot;) assisted by the Ministry of Transportation of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemenhub RI) on September 21, 2015. Trans Sidoarjo is a transportation system based on &quot;bus rapid transit&quot; (BRT) using fast, cheap and air-conditioned (AC) buses in the area around Sidoarjo. The Trans Sidoarjo route connects Purabaya Terminal with Porong Terminal via Toll Road, Terminal Larangan and Tanggulangin. Low passenger occupancy has caused Perum DAMRI to suffer losses, so it has gradually reduced the number of operating buses to ten units. Since the PPKM due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Trans Sidoarjo has stopped operating. In 2020, all Trans Sidoarjo bus units were converted to regular city bus routes PAC4 and PAC8.

==== End of Perum DAMRI operations ====
Based on a copy of the letter from the Land Transportation Observation Center (BPTD), as of September 1, 2022, Perum DAMRI has officially stopped all UABK or regular city bus services in Surabaya on the three routes it owns. This operational cessation moment is twelve days after the inauguration of Trans Jatim on August 19, 2022 and two days before the fuel price increase on August 3, 2022. Previously, Perum DAMRI was the sole operator on two regular city bus routes from the Purabaya Terminal such as the P4/PAC4 and P8/PAC8 routes. In addition, Perum DAMRI is one of the regular city bus operators for the P3/PAC3 route from Terminal Larangan, together with PO Estraa Mandiri, PO Akas NR and PO Ladju.
Several news reports from the mass media stated that Perum DAMRI will reactivate regular city bus services on the P4/PAC4 route on the Purabaya-Tanjung Perak route via the Toll Road which still has passenger occupancy. The route of the route is planned to be extended (extension) to Bangkalan Terminal. The discourse on extending the route had previously surfaced in 2009, but had not been realized. The discourse will be implemented at the end of 2022, when Perum DAMRI has received a grant in the form of 34 electric bus units produced by PT INKA after the G20 Summit in Bali ends.

===== Differences with modern city buses =====
Before bus rapid transit (BRT) was present in Indonesia, all city bus services generally still adopted a conventional (regular) management system and were similar to intercity bus services. In 2004, it was only Transjakarta is present in Jakarta City as the first modern city bus service based on road-based mass transportation and implementing BRT standards on an integrated corridor network. The implementation of these standards is a differentiator between Transjakarta as a modern city bus with several services such as Kopaja, MetroMini, Koantas Bima, Kopami, Miniarta, Kowanbisata, etc. as regular city buses or non-corridor city buses that already existed. The success of the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government in organizing public transportation with the Transjakarta service has become a pilot model for several local governments in implementing modern city buses in other big cities such as Trans Jogja (2008), Trans Semarang (2009), Batik Solo Trans (2010), Trans Musi (2010), Trans Sarbagita (2011), etc. The local government has started implementing a modern city bus operational scheme by converting regular city buses into modern city buses, or maintaining the existence of regular city buses.
In comparison with other big cities in Indonesia, the development of urban bus modes in Surabaya is relatively static and slower. However, Surabaya is the only city in East Java that still maintains regular city bus services, after similar services in Jember City were deactivated in 2007–2008. In the period between 1975–2015, regular city buses were still one of the main modes of public transportation within the city (besides transportation city and public passenger cars) that are able to survive and dominate the route network connecting strategic points in the city such as Purabaya Terminal, Larangan Terminal (Sidoarjo), Joyoboyo Terminal, Bratang Terminal, Jembatan Merah Plaza (JMP), Semut Station, Tanjung Perak Port (Ujung Baru) and Tambak Osowilangon Terminal. However, the era of the glory of regular city buses began to decline and degrade since the 2010s, along with the start of the operation of online transportation services and several modern city bus services or BRT in this city such as Trans Sidoarjo (2015), Suroboyo Bus (2018), Trans Semanggi Suroboyo (2021) and Trans Jatim (2022). As of September 2022, the population of regular city buses has shrunk to less than fifty units, spread across only four routes such as routes D, F, P3/PAC3 and P5.

==== Route lines and service operators ====
===== Service classes =====

Regular city bus services in Surabaya are divided into three levels of travel class based on differences in accommodation quality. The order of service classes from the lowest is economy, patas, and AC patas. Economy buses only have routes on arterial roads in the city, the fare is cheaper than the class above it, and can accommodate standing passengers (if the seat capacity is full). The express bus (an acronym for fast–limited) has a route on arterial roads and toll roads in the city, travel time is faster than economy buses, and carries limited passengers according to the maximum seat capacity. While the AC express bus is a express bus with additional facilities in the form of Air conditioning (AC). Most of the AC express bus units in Surabaya are units owned by Perum DAMRI. Express bus units that are no longer roadworthy and are more than fifteen years old will be replaced with AC express bus units gradually.
==== Route list ====
The Surabaya City Government began adding and adjusting regular city bus routes in the period 1991–1993. The route adjustments were made after several public infrastructures in the city were operated, such as the Purabaya Terminal, Tambak Osowilangon Terminal, Jalan Raya Ahmad Yani and Surabaya–Gresik Toll Road. Based on data from the Surabaya City Transportation Agency, there was a decrease in the number of regular city bus route permits in the period 2009–2017. The total number of city bus route permits in 2009 was 426 units spread across 22 active routes, while the total number of regular city bus route permits in 2017 decreased by 36%, with details of 274 units spread across twenty active routes.
===== Operator =====

Until 2021, regular city bus service providers in Surabaya are divided into two types of operators, namely BUMN operators and private operators. BUMN operators refer to the city bus transportation units (UABK) by Perum DAMRI Surabaya Branch. While private operators refers to the operational cooperation (KSO) unit of several private bus companies in East Java, whose units are employed for the regular city bus division. Since 2015, all regular city bus operators have begun to form legal entities in the form of limited liability company (PT) to facilitate operational arrangements in the field. Early September 2022, all regular city bus services will be operated by only ten private bus companies. There are a total of 39 buses from the bus company, which provide services on two economy routes, two express routes and one AC express route.

Perum DAMRI is the only regular city bus operator that implements a fixed salary system for bus crews, both drivers and conductors. In addition to Perum DAMRI, other operators implement a deposit system and profit sharing for bus crews. The crew gets their income based on the amount of money they have to deposit with the company. After the amount of money earned is reduced by the deposit, the remainder is divided among the crew.

===== Routes =====
===== Active routes =====

As of September 2022, there are four different travel routes on five active regular city bus routes in Surabaya. The seven routes consist of two economy bus routes, two express bus routes and three AC express bus routes. The five routes connect the southern end of the city such as Purabaya Terminal or Larangan Terminal with public transportation infrastructure in the north of the city such as Bratang Terminal and Jembatan Merah Plaza (JMP). The bus unit has an effective operational schedule between 05.00–17.00 WIB with a waiting time (&quot;headway&quot;) of at least 25 minutes from each terminal and stopping point.
* Purabaya–Bratang
* Purabaya–JMP via Diponegoro
* Sidoarjo–JMP via Toll
* Purabaya–JMP via Toll

===== Inactive route =====
Regular city bus units in Surabaya have their own platforms or departure lanes at the Purabaya Terminal since the revitalization of the terminal building in March 2013. The number of platforms provided is ten lanes, adjusting to the number of regular city bus lanes with high passenger occupancy. The ten route lanes are still operating routinely in the period 2013–2020. However, all regular city bus units on all routes have stopped operating since the Surabaya City Government implemented large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) and enforcement of restrictions on community activities (PPKM) due to the Covid-19 pandemic in this city. Several routes have started to operate again since the Surabaya City Government began to lower the PPKM level and the Purabaya Terminal has started to be visited by intercity bus units. However, there are several routes that are experiencing an empty bus unit, so that several of these routes are no longer operated (inactive).
* Purabaya–Ngagel–Semut
* Purabaya–Joyoboyo
* Purabaya–Tanjung Perak via Darmo
* Purabaya–Tanjung Perak via Toll Road
* Purabaya–Osowilangon Pond via Diponegoro
* Purabaya–Osowilangon via Toll Road

=== Bus unit specifications ===

In general, almost all regular city buses in Surabaya (except for AC patas buses) have a similar uniform pattern (&quot;livery&quot;) on the bus body. The uniform on the bus body uses a white base color and a special colored bumper according to the service class level. Some units even add large, eye-catching stickers of commercial product advertisements such as soft drinks, headache medicine, bird feed, footwear, furniture, beds, and so on.
Since 2009, some of the regular city bus units owned by Perum DAMRI that are not roadworthy (over fifteen years old) have begun to be rejuvenated and replaced with AC patas buses. Since mid-2018, Perum DAMRI has replaced some of the bus units on its routes with buses provided by the Ministry of Transportation of the Republic of Indonesia for the 2014 budget year. The Hino RK8 R260 chassis buses and Laksana Discovery bodies are former Trans Sidoarjo units.
Unlike Perum DAMRI, most of the regular city bus units owned by private operators use used buses with various specifications. Generally, bus units are obtained by utilizing used or rebuilt buses owned by operators, or buying used buses from other bus companies. This causes the fleets owned by private operators have a higher level of chassis and body type diversity than regular city bus units owned by Perum DAMRI which tend to be uniform.

==== Service payment system ====

The payment system for city bus services in Surabaya mostly still uses a conventional system, namely payment with cash directly to the conductor on the bus. Perum DAMRI has also implemented a ticket system, namely payment is made by paying cash to the conductor which is then exchanged for a ticket as proof of payment.
The type of service tariff applied is a fixed tariff, which means that the tariff is the same for both short and long distances. The amount of city bus service tariffs on all routes is further regulated in Surabaya Mayor Regulation Number 76 of 2014. Constraints from several factors such as the rise of online transportation, rising fuel prices, decreasing number of daily passengers, and the effects of the implementation of PSBB and PPKM have made all operators start to adjust the amount of service rates several times.

===== Other services =====
====== Integrated bus ======

In order to implement the Decree of the Minister of Transportation Number 35 of 2003, Perum DAMRI began opening city bus services as integrated buses in Surabaya since 2004. The integrated bus modes support intermodal connectivity (land, water and air transportation) with seamless, efficient and sustainable service characteristics (&quot;sustainable&quot;). Perum DAMRI in collaboration with PT Angkasa Pura I provides a bus service for connecting integrated modes infrastructure airport–bus terminal from Terminal 1 Domestic (T1) and Terminal 2 International (T2) Juanda International Airport using a special airport transportation unit (UAKB). In 2022, there are three travel routes on three integrated bus routes from Juanda Airport.
* Juanda (T1)–Purabaya via Aloha
* Juanda (T1)–Gresik via toll road
* Juanda (T1)–Mojokerto via the toll road

===== Intercity Bus =====
====== Gerbangkertosusila Agglomeration ======

Since two type A passenger terminals were built in the Surabaya border area such as Bungurasih and Tambak Osowilangon in the 1990s, all intercity bus route permits began to be transferred to the two terminals. However, there are several intercity bus services in the Gerbangkertosusila agglomeration area that have route permits that cover the inner city area. This causes the intercity bus units to be able to pick up and drop off passengers at the same stops or stopping points as the overlapping regular city bus routes. The following are intercity bus routes in Surabaya that have crossing points in the inner city area.
====== Across Java–Madura ======
Since the Suramadu Bridge began operating in 2010, several intercity bus routes within the province (AKDP) across Java–Madura have begun adjusting their routes and passenger stops in the northern area of Surabaya City. According to a circular from the East Java Provincial Transportation Agency, intercity buses are permitted to cross the Suramadu Bridge without having to cross the Ujung–Kamal crossing. Referring to the results of the agreement between the bus companies (PO) related to the local land transportation organization (organda), intercity buses are permitted to transport passengers on a limited basis and outside the operational schedule of city transportation (bemo) and regular city buses. Intercity buses can only pick up and drop off passengers from points such as Ujung Baru, Barunawati Park and Kedinding Lor.

===== Incident =====
A series of traffic accidents due to a bus experiencing brake failure occurred on September 14, 2022 at the Taman Mayangkara red light, Wonokromo. This incident involved a regular city bus unit belonging to PO Indrapura 88 on route F on the Purabaya-JMP route via Diponegoro, which hit six motorbikes and one car. This incident claimed the lives of four men and a pregnant woman. All victims have been rushed and treated at the Islamic Hospital (RSI) Jemursari. Based on findings in the field, the active period of roadworthiness test of the bus unit has apparently expired since April 2022, even though the bus still has an active route permit from the Surabaya Transportation Agency. The temporary suspicion of the Surabaya Police Traffic Unit is that this incident was caused by the bus driver being less careful in maintaining a safe distance. In addition, there are indications that the bus unit&#x27;s braking mechanism is not functioning optimally (failed) which causes a collision.

=====Gallery=====
===Taxis and autorickshaws===

Many cities and towns have some form of transportation for hire available as well such as taxis. Many cities also have motorised autorickshaws (&quot;bajaj&quot;) of various kinds. Cycle rickshaws, called &quot;becak&quot; in Indonesia, are a regular sight on city roads and provide inexpensive transportation. They have been blamed for causing traffic congestion and, consequently, banned from most parts of Jakarta in 1972. Horse-drawn carts are found in some cities and towns.

Ridesharing companies have become serious competition to both taxicabs and motorcycle taxis (&quot;ojek&quot;), with the four providers being Gojek, Maxim, Anterin, Grab and others.

===Minibus===
In more remote areas, and between smaller towns, most services are provided with minibuses or minivans (&quot;angkot&quot;). Buses and vans are also the primary form of transportation within cities. Often, these are operated as share taxis, running semi-fixed routes.

===Private cars===
Due to the increasing purchasing power of Indonesians, private cars are becoming more common especially in major cities. However the growth of the number of cars increasingly outpaces the construction of new roads, resulting in frequently crippling traffic jams in large parts in major cities especially in Jakarta, which often also happen on highways. Jakarta also has one of the worst traffic jams in the world.

Indonesia has been gradually introducing an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) since 2012. ITS Indonesia was formed on 26 April 2011.

===Other road transports===

* Becak

* Bentor

* Delman

* Nusantara Autonomous Rapid Transit
* Smart Pete-Pete

===National routes===
Indonesia has about of paved highways and of unpaved highways ( estimate). Four of Indonesia&#x27;s main highways are classified as parts of Asian Highway Network: AH2 section in Java and Bali, AH25 and AH151 in Sumatra, AH152 in Java and AH150 section in Kalimantan. Some of them has been numbered, currently only in Java and (partially) Sumatera.

National routes of Indonesia pass through the hearts of most main cities, and are designed to connect between city centres. They act as main inter-city route outside the tollways. A national route has to be passable by logistic trucks, while simultaneously handling the common traffic. National routes in Java are numbered, while those outside Java aren&#x27;t. In some cities, even in crowded districts, national routes often form bypasses or ring roads (Indonesian: &quot;jalan lingkar&quot;) around the city to prevent inter-city traffic entering the city center.

Ministry of Public Works and People&#x27;s Housing is responsible to these networks, except DKI Jakarta part from Jakarta Inner Ring Road to Jakarta Outer Ring Road. A national route can be revised if it serves unable to handle the traffic. It would usually be handled by the province/regional government.

Below were lists of some national routes in Indonesia:
* Sumatra: Trans-Sumatra Highway
* Java: North Coast, South Coast
* Kalimantan: Trans-Kalimantan Highway (Northern, Central, Southern)
* Sulawesi: Trans-Sulawesi Highway
* Papua: Trans-Papua Highway

===Toll roads===

All expressways in Indonesia are toll roads, known locally as (lit. toll road). The first expressway in Indonesia is the Jagorawi Toll Road, opened in 1978. 2,386 kilometers of expressways are operating as of 2021. Over of expressways opened during the first term of President Joko Widodo, surpassing previous administrations. Since 2018, all expressways do not accept any cash tolls; all tolls must be paid with certain contactless money cards.

The high cost of building and maintaining a national highway system means that Indonesia has to outsource the construction and maintenance to private and state-owned companies. Indonesia has an extensive system of highways consisting of:
==== Java ====
====Sumatra====
====Sulawesi====
* Makassar-Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport Toll Road
* Manado-Bitung Toll Road

====Lesser Sunda Islands====
Serangan-Tanjung Benoa Toll Road: The toll road between Tanjung Benoa to Airport and from Airport to Serangan, all in direct line (not curve) is 12.7 kilometres and is equipped also with motorcycle lanes. The toll road is formally opened on 23 September 2013, about a week before APEC Summit in Bali is opened.

====Kalimantan====
* Samarinda-Balikpapan Toll Road

== Railways ==

Indonesia&#x27;s main railways, operated by Kereta Api Indonesia and its subsidiaries, is used for both passenger and freight transport.

The majority of railways is located on Java. There are four separate railway networks on Sumatra: one in Aceh, one in North Sumatra (Aceh connection proposed to be finished in 2020s), another in West Sumatra, and the final one in South Sumatra and Lampung. South Sulawesi has railway network in Barru Regency as the impact of Trans-Sulawesi Railway construction, the first phase includes 146 kilometers route from Makassar to Parepare, which was completed in November 2022 and has been operating ever since. There are no railways in other parts of Indonesia, although new networks are being developed on islands such as Kalimantan and Papua.

The inter-city rail network is complemented by local commuter rail services, particularly in Jakarta metropolitan area and Surabaya. In Jakarta, the KRL Commuterline service carries more than a million passengers a day. Urban rail networks are also exists in few cities. Palembang LRT began operations in 2018, the first of such kind. The Jakarta MRT and Jakarta LRT began operations in 2019, with the Greater Jakarta LRT system being constructed and it commenced official commercial operations on 28 August 2023, after 11 days of Indonesian Independence Day.

The government&#x27;s plan to build a high-speed rail (HSR) was announced in 2015, the first in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. It is expected to connect the capital Jakarta with Bandung, covering a distance of around . Plans were also mentioned for its possible extension to Surabaya, the country&#x27;s second largest city. In 2023, the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Rail construction partially finished and is set to start commercial operation starting October 2023. The Jakarta-Bandung HSR began trial operation with passengers on 7 September 2023 and commercial operations on 2 October 2023.

== Pipelines ==
As of 2013, Indonesia has pipelines for condensate , condensate/gas , gas , liquid petroleum gas , oil , oil/gas/water , refined products , and water .

== Air transport ==
Air transport in Indonesia serves as a critical means of connecting the thousands of islands throughout the archipelago. Indonesia is the largest archipelagic country in the world, extending from east to west and from north to south, comprising 13,466 islands, with 922 of those permanently inhabited. With an estimated population of over 255 million people – making it the world&#x27;s fourth-most-populous country – and also due to the growth of the middle-class, the boom of low-cost carriers in the recent decade, and overall economic growth, many domestic travellers shifted from land and sea transport to faster and more comfortable air travel. Indonesia is widely regarded as an emerging market for air travel in the region. Between 2009 and 2014, the number of Indonesian air passengers increased from 27,421,235 to 94,504,086, an increase of over threefold.

However, safety issues continue to be a persistent problem in Indonesian aviation. Several accidents have given Indonesia&#x27;s air transport system the reputation of the least safe in the world. Indonesian aviation faces numerous challenges, including poorly maintained, outdated, and often overwhelmed infrastructure, the factor of human error, bad weather, haze problems caused by plantation fires, and volcanic ash spewed by numerous volcanoes that disrupts air transportation.

The Indonesian Air Force has 34,930 personnel equipped with 224 aircraft, among them 110 combat aircraft. The Indonesian Air Force possesses and operates numerous military air bases and military airstrips across the archipelago.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has predicted that Indonesia will become the world&#x27;s sixth largest air travel market by 2034. Around 270 million passengers are predicted to fly from and within Indonesia by 2034.

===Airports===
As of 2013, there are 673 airports in Indonesia, 186 of those have paved runways, and 487 have unpaved runways. As of 2013, there are 76 heliports in Indonesia. Jakarta&#x27;s Soekarno–Hatta International Airport serves as the country&#x27;s main air transportation hub as well as the nation&#x27;s busiest. Since 2010, it has become the busiest airport in Southeast Asia, surpassing Suvarnabhumi and Changi airports. In 2017, it became the 17th busiest airport in the world with 62.1 million passengers.

===Airlines===

In Indonesia, there are 22 commercial scheduled airlines that carry more than 30 passengers, and 32 commercial scheduled airlines that transport 30 or less passengers, as well as chartered airlines. Some notable Indonesian airlines, among others, include Garuda Indonesia, the government-owned flag carrier of Indonesia, Lion Air, currently the largest private low-cost carrier airline in Indonesia, Sriwijaya Air, currently the largest medium service regional carrier in Indonesia, also the country&#x27;s third largest carrier, and Indonesia AirAsia, the Indonesian branch of Malaysian-based AirAsia.

== Mudik ==
&quot;Mudik&quot;, or &quot;Pulang Kampung&quot;, is an Indonesian term for the activity where migrants or migrant workers return to their hometown or village during or before major holidays, especially Lebaran (Eid al-Fitr). Although the mudik homecoming travel before Lebaran takes place in most Indonesian urban centers, the highlight is on the nation&#x27;s largest urban agglomeration; Greater Jakarta, as millions of Jakartans exit the city by various means of transportation, overwhelming train stations and airports and also clogging highways, especially the Trans-Java toll road and Java&#x27;s Northern Coast Road.

In 2023 it was estimated that the people that took annual &quot;mudik&quot; travel reached 123 million people. 
The demand for train and airplane tickets usually spikes a month or two prior to Lebaran, prompting an unusually higher cost for tickets for highly sought days of departure. Some airlines might add extra flights or operate larger airplanes to deal with the surge in demand.

Indonesian train operator Kereta Api Indonesia usually offers additional train trips or introduces longer trains with more cars in order to meet the demand. The private operators of intercity and interprovince buses usually charge higher ticket costs during this period. The impact is indeed tremendous as millions of buses, cars and motorcycles jam the roads and highways, causing kilometres of traffic jams each year.

<text>The Indonesian National Armed Forces (; abbreviated as TNI) are the military forces of the Republic of Indonesia. It consists of the Army (&quot;TNI-AD&quot;), Navy (&quot;TNI-AL&quot;), and Air Force (&quot;TNI-AU&quot;). The President of Indonesia is the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. , it comprises approximately 400,000 military personnel including the Indonesian Marine Corps (), which is a branch of the Navy.

Initially formed with the name of the People&#x27;s Security Army (TKR), then later changed to the Republic of Indonesia Army (TRI) before changing again its name to the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) to the present. The Indonesian Armed Forces were formed during the Indonesian National Revolution, when it undertook a guerrilla war along with informal militia. As a result of this, and the need to maintain internal security, the Armed forces including the Army, Navy, and Air Force has been organised along territorial lines, aimed at defeating internal enemies of the state and potential external invaders.

Under the 1945 Constitution, all citizens are legally entitled and obliged to defend the nation. Conscription is provided for by law, however the Forces have been able to maintain mandated strength levels without resorting to a draft.

The Indonesian armed forces (military) personnel does not include members of law enforcement and paramilitary personnel such as the Indonesian National Police (Polri) consisting of approximately 440,000+ personnel, Mobile Brigade Corps (Brimob) of around 42,000+ armed personnel, and the Indonesian College Students&#x27; Regiment or (Menwa) which is a collegiate military service consisting 26,000 trained personnel.

== History ==

Before the formation of the Indonesian Republic, the military authority in the Dutch East Indies was held by the Royal Dutch East Indies Army (KNIL) and naval forces of the Royal Netherlands Navy (KM). Although both the KNIL and KM were not directly responsible for the formation of the future Indonesian armed forces, and mainly took the role of foe during Indonesian National Revolution in 1945 to 1949, the KNIL had also provided military training and infrastructure for some of the future TNI officers and other ranks. There were military training centers, military schools and academies in the Dutch East Indies. Next to Dutch volunteers and European mercenaries, the KNIL also recruited indigenous, especially Ambonese, Kai Islanders, Timorese, and Minahasan people. In 1940, with the Netherlands under German occupation and the Japanese pressing for access to Dutch East Indies oil supplies, the Dutch had opened up the KNIL to large intakes of previously excluded Javanese. Some of the indigenous soldiers that had enjoyed Dutch KNIL military academy education would later become important TNI officers, for example Suharto and Abdul Haris Nasution.
Indonesian nationalism and militarism started to gain momentum and support in World War II during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. To gain support from the Indonesian people in their war against the Western Allied force, Japan started to encourage and back Indonesian nationalistic movements by providing Indonesian youth with military training and weapons. On 3 October 1943, the Japanese military formed the Indonesian volunteer army called PETA (; Defenders of the Homeland). The Japanese intended PETA to assist their forces oppose a possible invasion by the Allies. The Japanese military training for Indonesian youth originally was meant to rally the local&#x27;s support for the Japanese Empire, but later it became the significant resource for the Republic of Indonesia during the Indonesian National Revolution from 1945 to 1949. Many of these men who served in PETA, both officers and NCOs alike like Sudirman, formed the majority of the personnel that would compose the future armed forces.
The Indonesian Armed Forces started out as the People&#x27;s Security Agency (, BKR), which was formed in the third PPKI meeting, on 29 August 1945. BKR united militias across the newly independent country to maintain civil order; it was more of a constabulary than an army. The decision to create a &quot;security agency&quot;, and not an army, was taken to avoid the Allied forces seeing it as an armed revolution and invading in full force. One of the terms of surrender to Japan was to return the Asian colonies they had conquered to their previous rulers, certainly not to make them independent.

When confrontations became sharp and hostile between Indonesia and the Allied forces, on 5 October 1945 the People&#x27;s Security Forces (, TKR) was formed on the basis of existing BKR units; this was a move taken to formalize, unite, and organize the splintered pockets of independent troopers () across Indonesia, ensuing a more professional military approach, to contend with the Netherlands and the Allied force invaders.

The Indonesian armed forces have seen significant action since their establishment in 1945. Their first conflict was the 1945–1949 Indonesian National Revolution, in which the 1945 Battle of Surabaya was especially important as the baptism of fire of the young armed forces.

In January 1946, TKR renamed as the People&#x27;s Safety Forces (, TKR), then succeeded by Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia (, TRI), in a further step to professionalize the armed forces and increase its ability to engage systematically.

In June 1947, the TRI, per a government decision, was renamed the Indonesian National Armed Forces (, TNI) which was a merger between the TRI and the independent paramilitary organizations () across Indonesia, becoming by 1950 the War Forces of the United States of Indonesia (, APRIS), by mid year the War Forces of the Republic of Indonesia (, APRI), also absolving native personnel from within both the former KNIL and KM within the expanded republic.

According to the official website of Indonesian veterans, there were 863,432 people who joined the struggle for Indonesian independence and this included those who were members of the militia, police, intelligence and auxiliary and as of 2023, there are still 25,676 Indonesian National Revolution veterans alive.
On 21 June 1962, the name (TNI) was changed to (Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia, ABRI). The POLRI (Indonesian National Police) was integrated under the Armed Forces and changed its name to (Police Force), and its commander maintained the concurrent status of Minister of Defense and Security, reporting to the President, who is commander in chief. The commanding generals (later chiefs of staff) and the Chief of the National Police then all held ministerial status as members of the cabinet of the republic, while a number of higher-ranking officers were appointed to other cabinet posts. On 1 July 1969, the Police Force&#x27;s name was reverted to &quot;POLRI&quot;.

After the fall of Suharto in 1998, the democratic and civil movement grew against the acute military role and involvements in Indonesian politics. As a result, the post-Suharto Indonesian military has undergone certain reforms, such as the revocation of the Dwifungsi doctrine and the terminations of military controlled business. The reforms also involved law enforcement in common civil society, which questioned the position of Indonesian police under the military corps umbrella. These reforms led to the separation of the police force from the military. In April 1999, the Indonesian National Police officially regained its independence and now is a separate entity from the armed forces proper. The official name of the Indonesian armed forces also changed from (ABRI) back to (TNI).

=== Future plans ===

At the beginning of 2010, the Indonesian government sought to strengthen the TNI to achieve minimum standards of minimum strength called &quot;&quot; (Minimum Essential Force, or MEF). The MEF was divided into three strategic five-year plan stages, 2010–2014, 2015–2019, and 2020–2024. Initially the government budgeted Rp156 trillion (around US$16 billion at the time) for the provision of TNI&#x27;s main weapon system equipment (known as , an abbreviation for or &quot;Main Weapons System&quot;) in the MEF period 2010–2014.

== Philosophy and doctrine ==

The Indonesian military philosophy about the defense of the archipelago is summarily civilian-military defence, called &quot;Total People&#x27;s Defense&quot;, consisting of a three-stage war: a short initial period in which an invader would defeat a conventional Indonesian military, a long period of territorial guerrilla warfare followed by a final stage of expulsion, with the military acting as a rallying point for defense from grass-roots village level upwards. The doctrine relies on a close bond between villager and soldier to encourage the support of the entire population and enable the armed forces to manage all war-related resources.

The civilian population would provide logistical support, intelligence, and upkeep with some of the population that is armed forces-trained to join the guerrilla struggle against the aggressor. The armed forces regularly engage in large-scale community and rural development. The &quot;Armed Forces Enters the Village&quot; (AMD/TMMD) program, begun in 1983, is held three times annually to organize and assist construction and development of civilian village projects.

The current developments in Indonesia&#x27;s defense policies are framed within the concept of achieving &quot;Minimum Essential Force&quot; or MEF by 2024. This concept of MEF was first articulated in Presidential Decree No. 7/2008 on General Policy Guidelines on State Defense Policy which came into effect on 26 January 2008. MEF is defined as a capability based defense and force level that can guarantee the attainment of immediate strategic defense interests, where the procurement priority is given to the improvement of minimum defense strength and/or the replacement of outdated main weapon systems/equipment. To achieve this aim, MEF had been restructured into a series of 3 strategic programs with timeframes from 2010 to 2014, 2015 to 2019 and 2020 to 2024 as well as spending of up to1.5–2% of the GDP.

The identity of the Indonesian National Armed forces is as defined by the Article 2 of the Law No 34/2004 on Indonesian National Armed forces is the TNI must aim to become the:

# People&#x27;s Military Forces, the armed forces whose serving personnel come from Indonesian citizens from all walks of life;
# Military of Warriors, which are soldiers who fought to establish the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia and do not recognize surrender in carrying out and completing its obligations;
# National Armed Forces, the Indonesian national armed forces who serve in the interest of the country and her people over the interests of the regions/provinces, ethnic groups, races, and religions;
# and Professional Armed Forces, an armed forces that is well-trained, well-educated, well-equipped, non-practicable, prohibited to do business and politics and guaranteed welfare, and following the country&#x27;s political policies that embrace democratic principles, civil supremacy, human rights, and the provisions of national law and international laws in force, as ratified and approved in the 1999–2003 amendments to the Constitution.

== Organization ==
The Indonesian armed forces have long been organized around territorial commands. Following independence, seven were established by 1958. No central reserve formation was formed until 1961 (when the 1st Army Corps of the Army General Reserve, &quot;CADUAD&quot;, the precursor of today&#x27;s Kostrad was established). It was only after the attempted coup d&#x27;état of 1 October 1965 and General Suharto&#x27;s rise to the presidency that it became possible to integrate the armed forces and begin to develop a joint operations structure.

Following a decision in 1985, major reorganization separate the Ministry of Defense and Security from the ABRI (, the name of the armed forces used during the New Order) headquarters and staff. MoDS was made responsible for planning, acquisition, and management tasks but had no command or control of troop units. The ABRI Commander in chief retained command and control of all armed forces and continued by tradition to be the senior military officer in the country, while continuing to be a part of the cabinet.

The administrative structure of Ministry of Defense and Security consisted of a minister, deputy minister, secretary general, inspector general, three directorates-general and a number of functional centers and institutes. The minister, deputy minister, inspector general, and three directors general were retired senior military officers; the secretary general (who acted as deputy minister) and most functional center chiefs were, as is the case today, active-duty military officers, while employees and staff were personnel of the armed forces and of the civil service.

The 1985 reorganization also made significant changes in the armed forces chain of command. The four multi-service Regional Defense Commands (&quot;Kowilhans&quot;) and the National Strategic Command (&quot;Kostranas&quot;) were eliminated from the defense structure, establishing the Military Regional Command (&quot;Kodam&quot;), or area command, as the key organization for strategic, tactical, and territorial operations for all services. The chain of command flowed directly from the &quot;ABRI&quot; commander in chief to the ten &quot;Kodam&quot; commanders, and then to subordinate army territorial commands. The former territorial commands of the air force and navy were eliminated from the structure altogether, with each of those services represented on the &quot;Kodam&quot; staff by a senior liaison officer. The navy and air force territorial commands were replaced by operational commands. The air force formed two Operational Commands (&quot;Ko-Ops&quot;) while the navy had its two Fleet Commands, the Western and Eastern Armadas. The air force&#x27;s National Air Defense Command (&quot;Kohanudnas&quot;) remained under the &quot;ABRI&quot; commander in chief. It had an essentially defensive function that included responsibility for the early warning system.

After Suharto&#x27;s presidential era collapsed in 1998, the Indonesian National Police was separated from the Armed Forces making the Indonesian Armed Forces under the direct auspices command of the Ministry of Defense and the Police Force under the direct auspices of the President of Indonesia. Before 1998, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia (the then name &quot;ABRI&quot;) was composed of four service branches: Indonesian Army, Indonesian Navy, Indonesian Air Force, and the Indonesian National Police. Then after 1998 (After reformation from Soeharto), the Armed Forces&#x27; name, in 1999, was changed to TNI () literally meaning: &quot;The National Military of Indonesia&quot; and the independent Indonesian Police Force changed its name to POLRI () literally meaning: &quot;The National Police Force of Indonesia&quot;. Now specifically, although the Armed Forces of Indonesia and the National Police of Indonesia has been separated, they still cooperate and conduct special duties and tasks together for the sake of the national security and integrity of Indonesia.

On 13 May 2018, Commander Hadi Tjahjanto reorganized the armed forces once more by inaugurating 4 new military units: Kostrad&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Division, Navy&#x27;s 3rd Fleet Command, Air Force&#x27;s 3rd Air Force Operations Command, and Marine Force III. The new military units are intended to reduce response time against any threats and problems in Eastern Indonesia. He also officially renamed the Western and Eastern Fleet Commands to 1st and 2nd Fleet Commands.

=== Branches ===
TNI has three service branches, the Army (TNI-AD), the Navy (TNI-AL), and the Air Force (TNI-AU). Each service branch is led by a Chief of Staff (Chief of Staff of the Army, Chief of Staff of the Navy, and Chief of Staff of the Air Force respectively) who is responsible for the administration and capability development for his/her own branch. These positions were previously called Commander or Panglima (for some period in 60s, it is a Minister-equivalent post) which was equipped with commanding authority until it was changed as Chief of Staffs (until now). In the present day, the Commander of The Indonesian National Armed Forces is the only military officer holding commanding authority for all the service branches under the overall authority of the President as Supreme Commander of the Forces.

*The TNI-AD (Indonesian Army) was first formed in 1945 following the end of World War II, to protect the newly independent country. It initially consisted of local militia and grew to become the regular army of today. The force now has up to 306,506 personnel, and comprises major strong territorial army commands known as &quot;Kodam&quot; and several independent regiments, brigades and battalions. The Army is also built up of operational commands and special forces such as the: Kopassus and the Kostrad units also with other types of formation within the Army itself. The Army also operates aircraft under the Army Aviation Command (&quot;Pusat Penerbangan Angkatan Darat&quot;). The Army operates 123 helicopters including combat, transport, and trainer models, and eight fixed-wing aircraft. The Army also guards and patrols the land borders with Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and East Timor.

*The TNI-AL (Indonesian Navy) was first formed on 22 August 1945. The current strength of the Navy is around up-to 74,000. In contrast to many other nations and military traditions, the Navy uses Army style ranks (&quot;See: Indonesian military ranks&quot;). The Navy has one centralized fleet command (Indonesian Fleet Command at Jakarta) which consists of three navy fleets which are the 1st Fleet Command (&quot;Koarmada I&quot;) based in Tanjungpinang, the 2nd Fleet Command (&quot;Koarmada II&quot;) based in Surabaya, and the 3rd Fleet Command (&quot;Koarmada III&quot;) based in Sorong, all three fleet forces commands holding responsibility for the defense of the three maritime and naval territorial commands. The Navy also has a management of aircraft and aviation systems which are operated by the Naval Aviation Center (). The Navy operates 63 fixed wing aircraft and 29 combat and transport helicopters. The Navy also includes the Indonesian Marine Corps (, or &quot;KorMar&quot;). It was created on 15 November 1945 and has the duties of being the main naval infantry and amphibious warfare force with quick reaction capabilities and special operations abilities.

*The TNI-AU (Indonesian Air Force) is headquartered in Jakarta, Indonesia. Its Order of Battle is under the Air Operations Commands (&quot;Koopsud&quot;) which consists of three operational commands (Koopsud I, Koopsud II, and Koopsud III). Most of its airbases are located on the island of Java. Presently, the Air Force has up-to 34,930 personnel equipped with 202 aircraft including Sukhoi Su-27s, Su-30s, F-16 Fighting Falcons, Hawk 100/200s, KAI T-50 Golden Eagles, and EMB 314 Super Tucanos. The Air Force also has air force infantry corps which is known as &quot;Kopasgat&quot; that are tasked for airbase defense, airborne troops and special forces unit.
*While no longer a part of the Armed Forces since 1 April 1999, the Indonesian National Police (&quot;POLRI&quot;) often operate in paramilitary roles independently or in co-operation with the other services on internal security missions, usually in cooperation with the Indonesian National Armed Forces (&quot;TNI&quot;). The National Police Mobile Brigade Corps are the main paramilitary forces which are usually put on to these roles and tasks with the service branches of the armed forces. Until today, both the &quot;TNI&quot; and the &quot;POLRI&quot; still holds strong ties and cooperation for the sake of the nation&#x27;s national security and integrity purposes.

<text>Since independence, Indonesian foreign relations have adhered to a &quot;free and active&quot; foreign policy, seeking to play a role in regional affairs commensurate with its size and location but avoiding involvement in conflicts among major powers. During the presidency of Sukarno, Indonesia&#x27;s foreign relations were marked by engagement with other newly independent nations in Asia and Africa, as exemplified by the Bandung Conference, the subsequent foundation of the Non-Aligned Movement and a confrontational attitude towards Western powers, justified by a belief in the CONEFO and opposition to what Sukarno termed as NEKOLIM (Neocolonialism and Imperialism).

After a US-backed ouster of Sukarno and left-wing elements in 1965, Indonesian foreign policy underwent a major shift under the &quot;New Order&quot; government, as President Suharto moved away from the stridently anti-Western, anti-American posturing that characterised the latter part of the Sukarno era. Following Suharto&#x27;s ouster in 1998, Indonesia&#x27;s government has preserved the broad outlines of Suharto&#x27;s independent, moderate foreign policy. Preoccupation with domestic problems has not prevented successive presidents from travelling abroad.

Indonesia&#x27;s relations with the international community were strained as a result of its invasion of neighbouring East Timor in December 1975, the subsequent annexation and occupation, the independence referendum in 1999, and the resulting violence afterwards. As one of the founding members of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), established in 1967, and also as the largest country in Southeast Asia, Indonesia has put ASEAN as the cornerstone of its foreign policy and outlook. After the transformation from Suharto&#x27;s regime to a relatively open and democratic country in the 21st century, Indonesia today exercises its influence to promote co-operation, development, democracy, security, peace and stability in the region through its leadership in ASEAN. Currently, Israel is the only UN member state that does not have formal diplomatic relations with Indonesia, although they maintain informal relations.

Indonesia managed to play a role as a peacemaker in the Cambodia–Thailand conflict over the Preah Vihear temple. Indonesia and other ASEAN member countries collectively have also played a role in encouraging the government of Myanmar to open up its political system and introduce other reforms more quickly.

Given its geographic and demographic size, rising capabilities and diplomatic initiatives, scholars have classified Indonesia as one of Asia-Pacific&#x27;s middle powers.

==Historical issues==
The foreign policy of Indonesia has evolved over time and has been shaped by various factors such as its historical context, geographic location, national interests, and leadership. Here is an overview of the historical context of Indonesia&#x27;s foreign policy:

* Founding Principles: Indonesia&#x27;s foreign policy is rooted in the country&#x27;s founding principles of Pancasila, which emphasizes peaceful coexistence, mutual respect, and non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries.
* Western New Guinea. The western part of New Guinea was under Dutch colonial rule and known as &quot;West Irian.&quot; When Indonesia gained independence from the Netherlands in 1945, the Dutch retained control over West Irian, but Indonesia claimed it. The United Nations supervised the transfer of West Irian to Indonesia in 1963. The region officially became a part of Indonesia in 1969 through a UN-sanctioned referendum known as the Act of Free Choice.
* Non-Aligned Movement: After gaining independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945, Indonesia played a prominent role in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). The NAM was a group of countries that chose not to align with any major power bloc during the Cold War, advocating for a neutral stance and promoting cooperation among developing nations.
* Regional Leadership: Indonesia has sought to establish itself as a leader in the Southeast Asian region. It was one of the founding members of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) in 1967 and has been actively involved in regional initiatives to promote peace, stability, and economic integration in Southeast Asia.
* &quot;Free and Active&quot; Foreign Policy: In the 1950s and 1960s, under the leadership of President Sukarno, Indonesia pursued a &quot;free and active&quot; foreign policy. This policy aimed at asserting Indonesia&#x27;s independence and taking an active role in global affairs by participating in international organizations, supporting decolonization movements, and advocating for the rights of developing nations.
* Post-Suharto Era: Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998, Indonesia underwent political and economic reforms. This period saw a shift in foreign policy priorities, focusing more on economic development, regional cooperation, and democracy promotion. Indonesia also embraced a more pragmatic approach in its foreign relations.
* East Timor: In 1975, shortly after East Timor declared independence from Portuguese colonial rule, Indonesia invaded and occupied the territory. The occupation lasted for 24 years and was marked by widespread human rights abuses, violence, and resistance from the East Timorese people. The international community largely condemned the occupation. Various human rights organizations and activists put pressure on Indonesia to leave. In 1999, Indonesia agreed to hold a UN-sponsored referendum to determine its political status. The majority of the East Timorese people voted for independence, leading to widespread violence and destruction orchestrated by pro-Indonesia militias. International peacekeeping forces, led by Australia, restored order. East Timor finally achieved independence in 2002.
* Territorial Integrity: Indonesia places great importance on its territorial integrity and has been firm in its stance against any threats to its sovereignty. It has been involved in various territorial disputes, including those in the South China Sea, and has sought to resolve them through peaceful means, including diplomatic negotiations.
* Counterterrorism and Maritime Security: Indonesia has actively cooperated with regional and international partners in combating terrorism and ensuring maritime security. It has been affected by terrorist attacks in the past and has taken steps to enhance intelligence-sharing, border control, and counterterrorism efforts.
* Economic Diplomacy: With the world&#x27;s fourth-largest population and a growing economy, Indonesia has focused on economic diplomacy to attract foreign investment, promote trade relations, and strengthen economic ties with other countries. It has pursued partnerships with both developed and developing nations to foster economic growth and development.
* Climate Change and Environmental Issues: As a country highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, Indonesia has been actively engaged in international efforts to address environmental issues. It has been a vocal advocate for sustainable development, forest conservation, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
* Global and Regional Multilateralism: Indonesia actively participates in various multilateral organizations, including the United Nations (UN), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). It has sought to contribute to global peace, security, and development by engaging in multilateral dialogues and fostering regional cooperation.

== Significant international memberships ==

=== Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ===

A cornerstone of Indonesia&#x27;s contemporary foreign policy is its participation in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which it was a founding member in 1967 with Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. Since then, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia also have joined ASEAN. While organised to promote shared economic, social, and cultural goals, ASEAN acquired a security dimension after Vietnam&#x27;s liberation of Cambodia in 1979; this aspect of ASEAN expanded with the establishment of the ASEAN Regional Forum in 1994, which comprises 22 countries, including the US.

The Indonesian capital Jakarta is also the seat of ASEAN Secretariat. Other than serving their diplomatic missions for Indonesia, numerous of foreign embassies and diplomatic mission in Jakarta are also accredited to ASEAN. The presence of the ASEAN Headquarters has made Jakarta a diplomatic hub in Southeast Asia in some regards.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Indonesia&#x27;s domestic troubles distracted it from ASEAN matters and consequently reduced its influence within the organisation. However, after the political and economic transformation, from the turmoil of 1998 &quot;Reformasi&quot; to the relatively open and democratic civil society with rapid economic growth in the 2010s, Indonesia returned to the region&#x27;s diplomatic stage by assuming its leadership role in ASEAN in 2011. Indonesia is viewed to have weight, international legitimacy and global appeal to draw support and attention from around the world to ASEAN. Indonesia believes that ASEAN can contribute positively to the international community, by promoting economic development and co-operation, improving security, peace, the stability of ASEAN, and making the Southeast Asia region far from conflicts.

Indonesia&#x27;s bilateral relations with three neighbouring ASEAN members—Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam—are not without challenges. If not appropriately managed, it would result in mutual mistrust and suspicion, thus hindering bilateral and regional co-operation. In the era of rising Indonesia, which might assert its leadership role within ASEAN, the problem could become more significant. Nevertheless, the rise of Indonesia should be regarded in the sense of optimism. First, although Indonesia is likely to become assertive, the general tone of its foreign policy is mainly liberal and accommodating. The consolidation of the Indonesian democratic government played a key role and influence in ASEAN. The second, institutional web of ASEAN will sustain engagements and regular meetings between regional elites, thus deepening their mutual understanding and personal connections.

=== Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) ===
Indonesia also was one of the founders of NAM and has taken moderate positions in its councils. As NAM Chairman in 1992–95, it led NAM positions away from the rhetoric of north–south confrontation, advocating the broadening of north–south co-operation instead in the area of development. Indonesia continues to be a prominent, and generally constructive, leader of the Non-Aligned Movement.

=== Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) ===
Indonesia has the world&#x27;s largest Muslim population and is a member of OIC. It carefully considers the interests of Islamic solidarity in its foreign policy decisions but generally has been an influence for moderation in the OIC.

=== Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ===
Indonesia has been a strong supporter of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Mainly through the efforts of President Suharto at the 1994 meeting in Indonesia, APEC members agreed to implement free trade in the region by 2010 for industrialised economies and 2020 for developing economies. As the largest economy in Southeast Asia, Indonesia also belongs to other economic groupings such as G20 and Developing 8 Countries (D-8).

=== G20 major economies ===
In 2008, Indonesia was admitted as a member of the G20, as the only ASEAN member state in the group. Through its membership in the global economic powerhouse that accounted of 85% of the global economy, Indonesia is keen to position itself as a mouthpiece for ASEAN countries, and as a representative of the developing world within the G20. Bali, Indonesia had played host to the 2022 G20 Summit.

=== BRICS ===

Indonesia became a full member of BRICS in January 2025. BRICS is an intergovernmental organization comprising ten countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.

=== IGGI and CGI ===
After 1966, Indonesia welcomed and maintained close relations with the international donor community, particularly the United States, western Europe, Australia, and Japan, through the meetings of the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) and its successor, the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI), which coordinated substantial foreign economic assistance. Problems in Timor and Indonesia&#x27;s reluctance to implement economic reform at times complicated Indonesia&#x27;s relationship with donors. In 1992 the IGGI aid coordination group ceased to meet and the coordination activities were transferred to meetings arranged by the World Bank through the CGI. The CGI, in turn, ceased activities in 2007 when the Indonesian government suggested that an internationally organised aid coordination program was no longer needed.

== International disputes ==
Indonesia has numerous outlying and remote islands, some of which are inhabited by numerous pirate groups that regularly attack ships in the Strait of Malacca in the north, and illegal fishing crews known for penetrating Australian and Filipino waters. At the same time, Indonesian waters are the target of large-scale illegal fishing activities by foreign vessels.

Indonesia has some present and historic territorial disputes with neighboring nations, such as:
* Ambalat Block in dispute with Malaysia (ongoing, overlapping EEZ line drawn by both countries)
* Ashmore and Cartier Islands in dispute with Australia (ongoing, the islands known by Indonesians as &quot;Pulau Pasir&quot;)
* Fatu Sinai Island (Pulau Batek) formerly disputed with Timor-Leste (settled, Timor-Leste ceded the island to Indonesia in August 2004)
* Miangas Island formerly disputed with Insular Government of the Philippine Islands (settled, part of Dutch East Indies and now Indonesia&#x27;s territory as of &quot;Island of Palmas Case&quot;)
* Northern waters off Natuna Islands in dispute with China and Taiwan (ongoing; overlapping with Chinese nine-dash line claim)
* Sipadan and Ligitan Islands formerly disputed with Malaysia (settled, part of Malaysia&#x27;s territory per International Court of Justice&#x27;s decision in 2002)

<text>The islands of Indonesia, also known as the [[Indonesian Archipelago]] () or [[Nusantara (term)|Nusantara]], may refer either to the islands composing the country of Indonesia or to the geographical groups which include its islands. Indonesia is the world&#x27;s largest archipelagic state, stretching from Sumatra in Asia to the western part of New Guinea in Oceania.

== History ==
The exact number of islands composing Indonesia varies among definitions and sources. According to the Law No 9/1996 on Maritime Territory of Indonesia, of 17,508 officially listed islands within the territory of the Republic of Indonesia. According to a geospatial survey conducted between 2007 and 2010 by the National Coordinating Agency for Survey and Mapping (Bakorsurtanal), Indonesia has 13,466 islands. However, according to earlier survey in 2002 by National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN), the Indonesian archipelago has 18,307 islands, and according to the CIA &quot;World Factbook&quot;, there are 17,508 islands. The discrepancy of the numbers of Indonesian islands is due to the earlier surveys including &quot;tidal islands&quot;; sandy cays and rocky reefs that appear during low tide and are submerged during high tide. As of 2023, 17,024 island have been named by Geospatial Information Agency and published in Indonesian Gazetteer.
