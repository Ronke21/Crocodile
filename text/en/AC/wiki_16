<text>Film stock is an analog medium that is used for recording motion pictures or animation. It is recorded on by a movie camera, developed, 
edited, and projected onto a screen using a movie projector. It is a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film base coated on one side with a gelatin emulsion containing microscopically small light-sensitive silver halide crystals. The sizes and other characteristics of the crystals determine the sensitivity, contrast and resolution of the film. The emulsion will gradually darken if left exposed to light, but the process is too slow and incomplete to be of any practical use. Instead, a very short exposure to the image formed by a camera lens is used to produce only a very slight chemical change, proportional to the amount of light absorbed by each crystal. This creates an invisible latent image in the emulsion, which can be chemically developed into a visible photograph. In addition to visible light, all films are sensitive to X-rays and high-energy particles. Most are at least slightly sensitive to invisible ultraviolet (UV) light. Some special-purpose films are sensitive into the infrared (IR) region of the spectrum.

In black-and-white photographic film there is usually one layer of silver salts. When the exposed grains are developed, the silver salts are converted to metallic silver, which blocks light and appears as the black part of the film negative. Color film has at least three sensitive layers. Dyes, which adsorb to the surface of the silver salts, make the crystals sensitive to different colors. Typically the blue-sensitive layer is on top, followed by the green and red layers. During development, the exposed silver salts are converted to metallic silver, just as with black-and-white film. But in a color film, the by-products of the development reaction simultaneously combine with chemicals known as color couplers that are included either in the film itself or in the developer solution to form colored dyes. Because the by-products are created in direct proportion to the amount of exposure and development, the dye clouds formed are also in proportion to the exposure and development. Following development, the silver is converted back to silver salts in the &quot;bleach step&quot;. It is removed from the film in the &quot;fix step&quot; and is sometimes recovered for subsequent use or sale. Fixing leaves behind only the formed color dyes, which combine to make up the colored visible image. Later color films, like Kodacolor II, have as many as 12 emulsion layers, with upwards of 20 different chemicals in each layer. Photographic film and film stock tend to be similar in composition and speed, but often not in other parameters such as frame size and length.

==History==

===1888–1899: Before standardization===
Early motion picture experiments in the 1880s were performed using a fragile paper roll film, with which it was difficult to view a single, continuously moving image without a complex apparatus. The first transparent and flexible film base material was celluloid, which was discovered and refined for photographic use by John Carbutt, Hannibal Goodwin, and George Eastman. Eastman Kodak made celluloid film commercially available in 1889; Thomas Henry Blair, in 1891, was his first competitor. The stock had a frosted base to facilitate easier viewing by transmitted light. Emulsions were orthochromatic. By November 1891 William Dickson, at Edison&#x27;s laboratory, was using Blair&#x27;s stock for Kinetoscope experiments. Blair&#x27;s company supplied film to Edison for five years. Between 1892 and 1893, Eastman experienced problems with production. Because of patent lawsuits in 1893, Blair left his American company and established another in Britain. Eastman became Edison&#x27;s supplier of film.

Blair&#x27;s new company supplied European filmmaking pioneers, including Birt Acres, Robert Paul, George Albert Smith, Charles Urban, and the Lumière Brothers. By 1896, the new movie projector required a fully transparent film base that Blair&#x27;s American operation could not supply. Eastman shortly thereafter bought the company out and became the leading supplier of film stock. Louis Lumière worked with Victor Planchon to adapt the Lumière &quot;Blue Label&quot; (Etiquette Bleue) photographic plate emulsion for use on celluloid roll film, which began in early 1896.

Eastman&#x27;s first motion picture film stock was offered in 1889. At first the film was the same as photographic film. By 1916, separate &quot;Cine Type&quot; films were offered. From 1895, Eastman supplied their motion picture roll film in rolls of 65 feet, while Blair&#x27;s rolls were 75 feet. If longer lengths were needed, the unexposed negative rolls could be cemented in a darkroom, but this was largely undesirable by most narrative filmmakers. The makers of Actuality films were much more eager to undertake this method, however, in order to depict longer actions. They created cemented rolls as long as 1,000 feet. American Mutoscope and Biograph was the first known company to use such film for the Jeffries-Sharkey fight on 3 November 1899.

===1900–1919: Toward the standard picture film===
As the quantity of film and filmmakers grew, the demand for standardization increased. Between 1900 and 1910, film formats gradually became standardized and film stocks improved. A number of film gauges were made. Eastman increased the length of rolls to 200 feet without major adjustments to the emulsion, retaining a large market share. Lumière reformulated its stock to match the speed of Eastman film, naming it &#x27;Etiquette Violette&#x27; (Violet Label). Blair sold his English company to Pathé in 1907 and retired to the US. Pathé began to supplement its operation in 1910 by purchasing film prints, stripping the emulsion from the film base and re-coating it. 35mm film began to become the dominant gauge because of the commonality of Edison&#x27;s and Lumière&#x27;s cameras. Consumers usually purchased unperforated film and had to punch it by perforators that were often imprecise, causing difficulty in making prints for the opposite perforation format. In 1908, the perforators began to be made by Bell and Howell. Eastman Kodak used the Bell and Howell machine to perforate its films. In 1909, Edison&#x27;s organization of the Motion Picture Patents Trust agreed to what would become the standard: 35 mm gauge, with Edison perforations and a 1.33 aspect ratio.

Agfa began to produce motion picture film in 1913, but remained a largely local supplier until World War I boycotts of popular French, American and Italian film stocks allowed the UFA film studio to flourish, boosting Agfa&#x27;s orders. All film stocks were manufactured on a nitrate film base, which is highly flammable. Nitrate film fires were virtually impossible to extinguish. A significant number of fatal accidents occurred in theatrical projection booths, where the heat of the projector lamp made ignition a possibility. Amateur filmmaking (home movies) slowly developed during this period. Kodak developed a heat-resistant &#x27;safety base&#x27; for home projection.

In 1909, tests showed cellulose diacetate to be a viable replacement base, and Kodak began selling acetate-base films the following year in 22 mm widths for Edison&#x27;s work on the Home Kinetoscope, which was commercially released in 1912. Eastman Kodak introduced a non-flammable 35 mm film stock in 1909. The plasticizers used to make the film flexible evaporated quickly, making the film dry and brittle, causing splices to part and perforations to tear. In 1911 the major American film studios returned to using nitrate stock. More amateur formats began to use acetate-based film, and several, including Kodak&#x27;s own 16 mm format, were designed specifically to be manufactured with safety base. Kodak released Cine Negative Film Type E in 1916 and Type F (later known as Negative Film Par Speed Type 1201) in 1917. As both of these orthochromatic films were no faster than previous offerings, the improvements were in granularity and sharpness.

===1920s: Diversification of film sensitivity===
Film stock manufacturers began to diversify their products. Each manufacturer had previously offered one negative stock (usually orthochromatic) and one print stock. In 1920, a variant of Type F film known as X-back was introduced to counteract the effects of static electricity on the film, which can cause sparking and create odd exposure patterns on the film. A resin backing was used on the film, which rendered the film too opaque to allow focusing through the back of the film, a common technique for many cameras of that era. The X-back stock was popular on the east coast of the US. Other manufacturers were established in the 1920s, including American E.I. Dupont de Nemours in 1926 and Belgian Gevaert in 1925. Panchromatic film stock became more common. Created in 1913 for use in early color film processes such as Kinemacolor, panchromatic was first used in a black-and-white film for exterior sequences in &quot;Queen of the Sea&quot; (1918) and originally available as a special order product. The stock&#x27;s increased sensitivity to red light made it an attractive option for day for night shooting. Kodak financed a feature in 1922, shot entirely with panchromatic stock, &quot;The Headless Horseman&quot;, to promote the film when Kodak introduced it as a standard option. Panchromatic film stock increased costs and no motion pictures were produced on it in their entirety for several years. The cross-cutting between panchromatic and orthochromatic stocks caused continuity problems with costume tones and panchromatic film was often avoided.

Orthochromatic film remained dominant until the mid-1920s due to Kodak&#x27;s lack of competition in the panchromatic market. In 1925, Gevaert introduced an orthochromatic stock with limited color sensitivity and a fully panchromatic stock, Pan-23. In 1926, Kodak lowered the price of panchromatic stock to parity with its orthochromatic offering and the panchromatic stock began to overtake the orthochromatic stock&#x27;s market share within a few years. As similar panchromatic film stocks were also manufactured by Agfa and Pathé, making the shift to panchromatic stocks largely complete by 1928, Kodak discontinued orthochromatic stock in 1930.

===Color films===

Experiments with color films were made as early as the late 19th century, but practical color film was not commercially viable until 1908, and for amateur use when Kodak introduced Kodachrome for 16 mm in 1935 and 8 mm in 1936. Commercially successful color processes used special cameras loaded with black-and-white separation stocks rather than color negative. Kinemacolor (1908–1914), Technicolor processes 1 through 4 (1917–1954), and Cinecolor used one, two or three strips of monochrome film stock sensitized to certain primary colors or exposed behind color filters in special cameras. Technicolor introduced a color reversal stock, called Monopack, for location shooting in 1941; it was ultimately a 35 mm version of Kodachrome that could be used in standard motion picture cameras.

Eastman Kodak introduced their first 35mm color negative stock, Eastman Color Negative film 5247, in 1950. A higher quality version in 1952, Eastman Color Negative film 5248, was quickly adopted by Hollywood for color motion picture production, replacing both the expensive three-strip Technicolor process and Monopack.
==Classification and properties==
There are several variables in classifying stocks; in practice, one orders raw stock by a code number, based on desired sensitivity to light.

===Base===

A piece of film consists of a light-sensitive emulsion applied to a tough, transparent base, sometimes attached to anti-halation backing or &quot;rem-jet&quot; layer (now only on camera films). Originally the highly flammable cellulose nitrate was used. In the 1930s, film manufacturers introduced &quot;safety film&quot; with a cellulose triacetate plastic base. All amateur film stocks were safety film, but the use of nitrate persisted for professional releases. Kodak discontinued the manufacture of nitrate base in 1951, and the industry transitioned entirely to safety film in 1951 in the United States and by 1955 internationally. Since the late 1990s, almost all release prints have used polyester film stock.

===Emulsion===
The emulsion consists of silver halide grains suspended in a gelatin colloid; in the case of color film, there are three layers of silver halide, which are mixed with color couplers and interlayers that filter specific light spectra. These end up creating yellow, cyan, and magenta layers in the negative after development.

===Chemistry===
Development chemicals applied to an appropriate film can produce either a positive (showing the same densities and colors as the subject) or negative image (with dark highlights, light shadows, and, in principle, complementary colors). The first films were darkened by light: negative films. Later films that produce a positive image became known as reversal films; processed transparent film of this type can be projected onto a screen. Negative images need to be transferred onto photographic paper or other substrate which reverses the image again, producing a final positive image. Creating a positive image from a negative film can also be done by scanning the negative to create a computer file which can then be reversed by software.

===Image record===
Different emulsions and development processes exist for a variety of image recording possibilities: the two most common of which are black and white, and color. However, there are also variant types, such as infrared film (in black and white or false color); specialist technical films, such as those used for X-rays; and obsolete processes, such as orthochromatic film. Generally, however, the vast majority of stock used today is &quot;normal&quot; (visible spectrum) color, although &quot;normal&quot; black and white also commands a significant minority percentage.

===Physical characteristics===
Film is also classified according to its gauge and the arrangement of its perforations— gauges range from 8 mm to 70 mm or more, while perforations may vary in shape, pitch, and positioning. The film is also distinguished by how it is wound with regard to perforations and base or emulsion side, as well as whether it is packaged around a core, a daylight spool, or within a cartridge. Depending on the manufacturing processes and camera equipment, lengths can vary anywhere from 25 to 2000 feet. Common lengths include 25 feet for 8 mm, 50 feet for Super 8, 100 and 400 feet for 16 mm, 400 and 1000 feet for 35 mm, and 1000 for 65/70 mm.

===Responsivity===
A critical property of a stock is its film speed, determined by ASA or its sensitivity to light listed by a measurement on the raw stock which must be chosen with care. Speed determines the range of lighting conditions under which the film can be shot, and is related to granularity and contrast, which influence the look of the image. The stock manufacturer will usually give an exposure index (EI) number equal to the ASA which they recommend exposing for. However, factors such as forced or non-standard development (such as bleach bypass or cross processing), compensation for filters or shutter angle, as well as intended under- and over-exposure may cause the cinematographer to actually &quot;rate&quot; the stock differently from the EI. This new rating is not a change to the stock itself — it is merely a way of calculating exposure without figuring out the compensation after each light reading.

===Color temperature===
Another important quality of color film stock in particular is its color balance, which is defined by the color temperature at which it accurately records white. Tungsten lighting is defined at 3200 K, which is considered &quot;warmer&quot; in tone and shifted towards orange; daylight is defined at 5600 K, which is considered &quot;colder&quot; and shifted towards blue. This means that unfiltered tungsten stock will look normal shot under tungsten lights, but blue if shot during daylight. Conversely, daylight stock shot in daylight will look normal, but orange if shot under tungsten lights. Color temperature issues such as these can be compensated for by other factors such as lens filters and color gels placed in front of the lights. The color temperature of a film stock is generally indicated next to the film speed number — e.g. 500T stock is color film stock with an ASA of 500 and balanced for tungsten light; 250D would have an ASA of 250 and be balanced for daylight. While black-and-white film has no color temperature itself, the silver halide grains themselves tend to be slightly more responsive to blue light, and therefore will have daylight and tungsten speeds — e.g. Kodak&#x27;s Double-X stock is rated 250D/200T, since the tungsten light will give slightly less exposure than an equivalent amount of daylight.

===Sound===

A fundamental limitation of film stock as a recording medium is that it reacts to light, but not sound. This is why the first films were literally silent (and exhibitors often provided live musical accompaniment to compensate). Sound films later became possible after engineers developed techniques like sound-on-disc to synchronize playback of a separate soundtrack and then sound-on-film to print the soundtrack on the film itself.

==Deterioration==

All plastic is subject to deterioration through physical or chemical means, and thus, motion picture film is at risk for the same reason. Films deteriorate over time, which can damage individual frames or even lead to the entire film being destroyed. Cellulose nitrate, cellulose diacetate and triacetate are known to be unstable media: improperly preserved film can deteriorate in a period of time much faster than many photographs or other visual presentations. Cellulose nitrate, because of its unstable chemistry, eventually breaks down, releasing nitric acid, further catalyzing the decomposition. In the final stage of celluloid decomposition, the film has turned into a rust-like powder. Likewise, tri-acetate stock is also vulnerable to deterioration. Because of the small gauge of the film, owners of home-made films often find that their film can become shrunken and brittle to the point where the film is unwatchable in the space of a few years. In general, decaying acetate film breaks down into acetic acid, and similar to celluloid decomposition, leads to an auto-catylictic breakdown of the base that cannot be reversed. The result of the acetic acid released is a strong odor of vinegar, which is why the decay process in the archival community is known as &quot;vinegar syndrome&quot;. Modern polyester-based stocks are far more stable by comparison and are rated to last hundreds of years if stored properly.

==Intermediate and print stocks==
The distinction between camera stocks and print stocks involves a difference in the recording process. When the work print or edit master has been approved, the Original Camera Negative (OCN) is assembled by a negative cutter using the edited work print or EDL (edit decision list) as a guide. A series of Answer Prints are then made from the OCN. During the Answer Print stage, corrections in the film&#x27;s density and color are corrected (timed) to the filmmakers&#x27; tastes. Interpositive (IP) prints are struck from the OCN, checked to make sure they look the same as the custom timed Answer Print, and then each IP is used to make one or more Dupe Negative (DN) copies. The release prints are then generated from the DN(s). Recently, with the development of digital intermediate (DI), it has become possible to completely edit, composite visual effects, and color grade the image digitally at full resolution and bit-depth. In this workflow, the answer print is generated digitally and then written out to the IP stage using a laser film printer known as a film recorder.

Due to the specialized nature of the exposure and the higher degree of control afforded by the film lab equipment, these intermediate and release stocks are specially designed solely for these applications and are generally not feasible for camera shooting. Because intermediates only function to maintain the image information accurately across duplication, each manufacturer tends to only produce one or two different intermediate stocks. Similarly, release print stocks usually are available only in two varieties: a &quot;normal&quot; print or a deluxe print (on more-costly print film like Kodak Vision Premiere) with slightly greater saturation and contrast.

==Decline==
Use of film remained the dominant form of cinematography until the early 21st century when digital formats supplanted the use of film in many applications. This has also led to the replacement of film projectors with digital projection.

Despite this, some filmmakers continue to opt for film stock as a medium of choice for aesthetic reasons. Movies produced entirely on photochemical film or with a combination of analog and digital methods are a minority, but maintain a stable presence among both arthouse and mainstream film releases. 

However, digital formats are sometimes deliberately altered to achieve a film look, such as adding film grain or other noise for artistic effect.

<text>Form 1040, officially, the U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, is an IRS tax form used for personal federal income tax returns filed by United States residents. The form calculates the total taxable income of the taxpayer and determines how much is to be paid to or refunded by the government.

Income tax returns for individual calendar-year taxpayers are due by Tax Day, which is usually April 15 of the following year, except when April 15 falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday. In those circumstances, the returns are due on the next business day after April 15. An automatic extension until October 15 to file Form 1040 can be obtained by filing Form 4868 (but that filing does not extend a taxpayer&#x27;s required payment date if tax is owed; it must still be paid by Tax Day).

Form 1040 consists of two pages (23 lines in total), not counting attachments. The first page collects information about the taxpayer(s) and dependents. In particular, the taxpayer&#x27;s filing status is reported on this page. The second page reports income, calculates the allowable deductions and credits, figures the tax due given adjusted income, and applies funds already withheld from wages or estimated payments made towards tax liability. On the right side of the first page is the presidential election campaign fund checkoff, which allows individuals to designate that the federal government give $3 of the tax it receives to the presidential election campaign fund. Altogether, 142 million individual income tax returns were filed for the tax year 2018 (filing season 2019), 92% of which were filed electronically.

==Filing requirements==

=== Who must file? ===

Form 1040 (or a variant thereof) is the main tax form filed by individuals who are deemed residents of the United States for tax purposes. The corresponding main form filed by businesses is Form 1120, also called the U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return.

An individual is considered a resident of the United States for tax purposes if he or she is a citizen of the United States or a resident alien of the United States for tax purposes. An individual is a resident alien of the United States if he or she passes either the Substantial Presence Test or the Green Card Test, although there are also some other cases; individuals who have taxable income in the United States but fail the criteria for being resident aliens must file as nonresident aliens for tax purposes. While residents of the United States for tax purposes file Form 1040, nonresident aliens must file Form 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ. There is also a &quot;dual status alien&quot; for aliens whose status changed during the year.

Resident aliens of the United States for tax purposes must generally file if their income crosses a threshold where their taxable income is likely to be positive, but there are many other cases where it may be legally desirable to file. For instance, even if not required, individuals can file a return in order to receive a refund on withheld income or to receive certain credits (e.g. earned income tax credit).

=== Filing modalities ===

The form may be filed either by paper or online.

==== Paper filing ====

Paper filing is the universally accepted filing method. Form 1040, along with its variants, schedules, and instructions, can be downloaded as PDFs from the Internal Revenue Service website. Finalized versions of the forms for the tax year (which in the US is the same as the calendar year) are released near the end of January of the following year.

Paper forms can be filled and saved electronically using a compatible PDF reader, and then printed. This way, it is easy to keep electronic copies of one&#x27;s filled forms despite filing by paper. Alternatively, they can be printed out and filled by hand. A combination of the approaches may also be used, with some content filled in electronically and additional content written in by hand. As a general rule, where possible, it makes sense to fill electronically, but in some cases filling by hand may be necessary (for instance, if additional notes of explanation need to be added, or the font used for electronic filling is too large to fit the information in the space provided).

The only parts of the form that cannot be filled electronically are the signature lines.

The paper Form 1040, along with all relevant schedules and additional forms, must be sent in a single packet by mail or courier to an IRS address determined by the US state the taxpayer is filing from and whether or not a payment is enclosed.

The IRS accepts returns that are stapled or paperclipped together. However, any check or payment voucher, as well as accompanying Form 1040-V, must &quot;not&quot; be stapled or paperclipped with the rest of the return, since payments are processed separately.

==== Electronic filing ====

The IRS allows US residents for tax purposes to file electronically in three ways:

* Those with incomes of $66,000 or less may file electronically using IRS Free File, a free e-filing tool (there are some other conditions necessary to be eligible for free filing; in particular, some kinds of income and deductions cannot be handled by free filing).
* It is possible to prepare one&#x27;s tax return using a tax compliance software approved by the IRS and have the software file the return electronically.
* One can use a tax professional who has been accepted by the IRS for electronic filing.

Many paid tax preparers are required to file individual tax returns electronically, and most tax compliance software file electronically on the taxpayer&#x27;s behalf. Even the tax preparers who are not so required, must file Form 8948 if they choose paper filing, providing an explanation for why they are not filing electronically.

==== Comparison ====

If one is not eligible for IRS Free File, depending on the company used it might cost hundreds of dollars to file electronically, whereas paper filing has no costs beyond those of printing and mailing. Furthermore, the available existing electronic filing options may not offer sufficient flexibility with respect to arranging one&#x27;s tax return, adding attachments, or putting written notes of explanation that can help preempt IRS questions. In the past, filing electronically may have exposed the taxpayer&#x27;s data to the risk of accidental loss or identity theft, but now e-filing with reputable companies is considered more secure than paper filing.
=== Signature requirement ===

Form 1040 must be signed and dated in order to be considered valid. If filing jointly with a spouse, both must sign and date. If a return is submitted electronically, individuals must use either a Self-Select PIN or Practitioner PIN.

=== Substitute return ===

If an individual decides not to file a return, the IRS may (after it has sent several reminders) file a substitute return.

==Variants==

For filing the regular tax return, in addition to the standard Form 1040, there are currently three variants: the 1040-NR 1040-SR, and 1040-X.

Form 1040-NR is used by taxpayers who are considered &quot;non-resident aliens&quot; for tax purposes.

Form 1040-SR may be used by taxpayers who are 65 or older. The 1040-SR form is functionally the same as 1040, but 1040-SR is easier to fill-out by hand, because the text is larger and the checkboxes are larger. Seniors may continue to use the standard 1040 for tax filing if they prefer. Its creation was mandated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, and it was first used for filing taxes for the 2019 tax year. 

Form 1040-X (officially, the &quot;Amended U.S. Individual Tax Return&quot;) is used to make corrections on Form 1040, Form 1040A, and Form 1040EZ tax returns that have been previously filed (note: forms 1040-A and 1040-EZ were discontinued starting with tax year 2018, but a 1040X may still be filed amending one of these tax forms filed for previous years).

== Accompanying payments ==

=== Form 1040-V ===
The 1040-V (officially, the &quot;Payment Voucher for Form 1040&quot;) is used as an optional payment voucher to be sent in along with a payment for any balance due on the &quot;Amount you owe&quot; line of the 1040.

The form is entirely optional. The IRS will accept payment without the 1040V form. However including the 1040-V allows the IRS to process payments more efficiently.

Form 1040-V and any accompanying payment should be included in the same packet as the tax return, but should &quot;not&quot; be stapled or paper-clipped along with the tax return, since it is processed separately.

==Schedules and extra forms==

Since 1961 Form 1040 has had various separate attachments to the form. These attachments are usually called &quot;schedules&quot; because prior to the 1961, the related sections were schedules on the main form identified by letter. Form 1040 currently has 20 attachments, which may need to be filed depending on the taxpayer. For 2009 and 2010 there was an additional form, , due to the &quot;Making Work Pay&quot; provision of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (&quot;the stimulus&quot;).

Starting in 2018, 1040 was &quot;simplified&quot; by separating out 6 new schedules numbers Schedule 1 through Schedule 6 to make parts of the main form optional. The new schedules had the prior old 1040 line numbers to make transition easier.

In addition to the listed schedules, there are dozens of other forms that may be required when filing a personal income tax return. Typically these will provide additional details for deductions taken or income earned that are listed either on form 1040 or its subsequent schedules.

In 2014 there were two additions to Form 1040 due to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act—the premium tax credit and the individual mandate.

In most situations, other Internal Revenue Service or Social Security Administration forms such as Form W-2 must be attached to the Form 1040, in addition to the Form 1040 schedules. There are over 100 other specialized forms that may need to be completed along with Schedules and the Form 1040. However, Form 1099 need not be attached if no tax was withheld. In general, employer-sent forms are used to substantiate claims of withholding, so only forms that involve withholding need to be attached.

==Estimated payments and withholding==

For most individuals, withholding is the main way through which taxes are paid. However, income that is not subject to withholding must be estimated using Form 1040-ES. (It may be possible to avoid filing Form 1040-ES by increasing one&#x27;s withholding and instead filing a Form W-4.)

Estimated payments can be made using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System.

==Payments, refunds, and penalties==

There is a three-year limit to when individuals can claim a tax refund. However, payments that are due must be paid immediately.

In addition it is possible to apply one&#x27;s refunds to next year&#x27;s taxes and also to change one&#x27;s mind later.

An automatic extension until October 15 to file Form 1040 can be obtained by filing Form 4868. There is a penalty for not filing a tax return by April 15 that depends on whether the individual got a filing extension and the amount of unpaid taxes. However, since the maximum penalty is 25% of unpaid taxes, if an individual has paid all their taxes, there is no penalty for not filing.

In addition to making sure that one pays one&#x27;s taxes for the year by Tax Day, it is also important to make sure that one has paid partial taxes throughout the tax year in the form of estimated tax payments or employer tax withholding. If one has not done so, then a tax penalty may be assessed. The minimum amount of estimated taxes that need to be paid to avoid penalties depends on a variety of factors, including one&#x27;s income in the tax year in question as well as one&#x27;s income in the previous year (in general, if one pays 90% of the current year&#x27;s tax liability or 100% of the previous year&#x27;s tax liability during the tax year, one is not subject to estimated tax penalty even if this year&#x27;s taxes are higher, but there are some caveats to that rule). Employer withholding is also treated differently from estimated tax payment, in that for the latter, the time of the year when the payment was made matters, whereas for the former, all that matters is how much has been withheld as of the end of the year (though there are other restrictions on how one can adjust one&#x27;s withholding pattern that need to be enforced by the employer).

When filing Form 1040, the penalty for failing to pay estimated taxes must be included on the form (on line 79) and included in the total on line 78 (if a net payment is due). The taxpayer is not required to compute other interest and penalties (such as penalty for late filing or late payment of taxes). If the taxpayer does choose to compute these, the computed penalty can be listed on the bottom margin of page 2 of the form, but should not be included on the amount due line (line 78).

==Relationship with state tax returns==
Each state has separate tax codes in addition to federal taxes. Form 1040 is only used for federal taxes, and state taxes should be filed separately based on the individual state&#x27;s form. Some states do not have any income tax. Although state taxes are filed separately, many state tax returns will reference items from Form 1040. For example, California&#x27;s 540 Resident Income Tax form makes a reference to Form 1040&#x27;s line 37 in line 13.

Certain tax filing software, such as TurboTax, will simultaneously file state tax returns using information filled in on the 1040 form.

The federal government allows individuals to deduct their state income tax or their state sales tax from their federal tax through Schedule A of Form 1040, but not both. In addition to deducting either income tax or sales tax, an individual can further deduct any state real estate taxes or private property taxes.

==OMB control number controversy==
One argument used by tax protesters against the legitimacy of the 1040 Form is the OMB Control Number of the Paperwork Reduction Act argument. Tax protesters contend that Form 1040 does not contain an &quot;OMB Control Number&quot; which is issued by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

The relevant clauses of the Paperwork Reduction Act state that:
::§ 1320.6 Public protection.

::(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person shall be subject to any penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information that is subject to the requirements of this part if:

::::(1) The collection of information does not display, in accordance with §1320.3(f) and §1320.5(b)(1), a currently valid OMB control number assigned by the Director in accordance with the Act...

::(e) The protection provided by paragraph (a) of this section does not preclude the imposition of a penalty on a person for failing to comply with a collection of information that is imposed on the person by statute—e.g., 26 U.S.C. §6011(a) (statutory requirement for person to file a tax return)...

The Courts have responded to the OMB Control Number arguments with the following arguments. 1) Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return has contained the OMB Control number since 1981. 2) As ruled in a number of cases, the absence of an OMB Control number does not eliminate the legal obligation to file or pay taxes.

Cases involving the OMB Control Number Argument include:
*&quot;United States v. Wunder&quot;
The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit argues that the provisions on the Paperwork Reduction Act are not relevant as the act applies only to information requests made after December 31, 1981, and tax returns starting from 1981 contained an OMB Control Number.
*&quot;United States v. Patridge&quot;
The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected the convicted taxpayer&#x27;s OMB control number argument by stating &quot;Finally, we have no doubt that the IRS has complied with the Paperwork Reduction Act. Form 1040 bears a control number from OMB, as do the other forms the IRS commonly distributes to taxpayers. That this number has been constant since 1981 does not imply that OMB has shirked its duty.&quot;
*&quot;United States v. Lawrence&quot;
In this Case, IRS agents who had calculated Lawrence&#x27;s tax liability had made an error and it was discovered that Lawrence owed less taxes than originally determined. Lawrence asked the trial court to order the government to reimburse him for his legal fees, to which the trial court ruled against him. He appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, contending that the government&#x27;s conduct against him had been &quot;vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith.&quot; and also raising the OMB Control Number Argument.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected the OMB argument stating that
According to Lawrence, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) required the Internal Revenue Service to display valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) numbers on its Form 1040... Lawrence argues that the PRA by its terms prohibits the government from imposing a criminal penalty upon a citizen for the failure to complete a form where the information request at issue does not comply with the PRA... Yet Lawrence conceded at oral argument that no case from this circuit establishes such a proposition, and in fact Lawrence cites no caselaw from any jurisdiction that so holds. In contrast, the government referenced numerous cases supporting its position that the PRA does not present a defense to a criminal action for failure to file income taxes.&quot;

==History==

=== Original form structure and tax rates ===

The first Form 1040 was published for use for the tax years 1913, 1914, and 1915;
the number 1040 was simply the next number in the sequential numbering of forms. For 1913, taxes applied only from March 1 to December 31. The original Form 1040, available on the IRS website as well as elsewhere, is three pages and 31 lines long, with the first page focused on computing one&#x27;s income tax, the second page focused on more detailed documentation of one&#x27;s income and the third page describing deductions and including a signature area. There is an additional page of instructions. The main rules were:

* The taxable income was calculated starting from gross income, subtracting business-related expenses to get net income, and then subtracting specific exemptions (usually $3,000 or $4,000). In other words, people with net incomes below $3,000 would have to pay no income tax at all. The inflation calculator used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the corresponding amount in 2015 dollars as $71,920.
* The base income tax rate on taxable income was 1%.
* High earners had to pay additional taxes. The first high-earning tax bracket, $20,000–$50,000, has an additional tax of 1% on the part of net income above $20,000. Thus, somebody with a taxable income of $50,000 (over a million dollars in 2015 dollars according to the BLS) would pay a total of $800 (1% of $50,000 + 1% of $(50,000 − 20,000)) in federal income tax. At the time (when the United States as a whole was much poorer) these higher taxes applied to fewer than 0.5% of the residents of the United States.

Just over 350,000 forms were filed in 1914 and all were audited.

=== Subsequent changes ===
For 1916, Form 1040 was converted to an annual form (i.e., updated each year with the new tax year printed on the form). Initially, the IRS mailed tax booklets (Form 1040, instructions, and most common attachments) to all households. As alternative delivery methods (CPA/Attorneys, Internet forms) increased in popularity, the IRS sent fewer packets via mail. In 2009 this practice was discontinued.

With the Current Tax Payment Act of 1943, income tax withholding was introduced. The Individual Income Tax Act of 1944 created standard deductions on the 1040.

The tax return deadline was original set at March 1. This was changed to March 15 in the Revenue Act of 1918, and in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the tax return deadline was changed to April 15 from March 15, as part of a large-scale overhaul of the tax code. The reason for March 1 was not explained in the law, but was presumably to give time after the end of the tax (and calendar) year to prepare tax returns. The two-week extension from March 1 to March 15 occurred after the Revenue Act of 1918 was passed in February 1919, given only a few weeks to complete returns under the new law. The month extension from March 15 to April 15 was to give additional time for taxpayers and accountants to prepare taxes, owing to the more complex tax code, and also helped spread work by the IRS over a longer time, as it would receive returns over a longer time.

The 1040A was introduced by the 1930s to simplify the filing process and discontinued after tax year 2017. It was limited to taxpayers with taxable income below $100,000 who take the standard deduction instead of itemizing deductions.

The 1040EZ was used for tax years 1982–2017. Its use was limited to taxpayers with no dependents to claim, with taxable income below $100,000 who take the standard deduction instead of itemizing deductions.

Electronic filing was introduced in a limited form in 1986, with the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and starting 1992, taxpayers who owed money were allowed to file electronically. The Electronic Federal Tax Payment System, jointly managed by the IRS and Financial Management Service, started in 1996 and allowed people to make estimated payments.

With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, a new, redesigned Form 1040 was released for tax year 2018. It reduced the number of lines from 79 to 23, removed two of the variants (1040A and 1040EZ) in favor of the redesigned Form 1040, and redesigned the supplemental schedules.

=== Changes to complexity and tax rates ===
The complexity and compliance burden of the form and its associated instructions have increased considerably since 1913. The National Taxpayers Union has documented the steady increase in complexity from a 34-line form in 1935 to a 79-line form in 2014, decreasing to 23 lines in 2018. &quot;Quartz&quot; created an animated GIF showing the gradual changes to the structure and complexity of the form. The NTU table is below with data through 2014:

The number of pages in the federal tax law grew from 400 in 1913 to over 72,000 in 2011. The increase in complexity can be attributed to an increase in the number and range of activities being taxed, an increase in the number of exemptions, credits, and deductions available, an increase in the subtlety of the rules governing taxation and the edge cases explicitly spelled out based on historical experience, and an increase in the base of taxpayers making it necessary to offer longer, more explicit instructions for less sophisticated taxpayers. As an example, whereas the initial versions of Form 1040 came only with a rate schedule included in the tax form itself, the IRS now publishes a complete tax table for taxable income up to $100,000 so that people can directly look up their tax liability from their taxable income without having to do complicated arithmetic calculations based on the rate schedule. The IRS still publishes its rate schedule so that people can quickly compute their approximate tax liability, and lets people with incomes of over $100,000 compute their taxes directly using the Tax Computation Worksheet.

In addition to an increase in the complexity of the form, the tax rates have also increased, though the increase in tax rates has not been steady (with huge upswings and downswings) in contrast with the steady increase in tax complexity.

===Cost of filing===
For tax return preparation, Americans spent roughly 20 percent of the amount collected in taxes (estimating the compliance costs and efficiency costs is difficult because neither the government nor taxpayers maintain regular accounts of these costs). As of 2013, there were more tax preparers in the US (1.2 million) than there were law enforcement officers (765 thousand) and firefighters (310,400) combined. The National Taxpayers Union estimated the 2018 compliance cost at 11 hours per form 1040 vs. 12 hours in 2017, with a total of $92.5 billion spent in individual income tax compliance vs. $94.27 billion in 2017.

In 2008, 57.8 percent of tax returns were filed with assistance from paid tax preparers, compared to about 20 percent of taxpayers employing a paid preparer in the 1950s.

<doc id="11033" wikidata="Q215562" url="?curid=11033" title="Frederick Douglass">
<text>Frederick Douglass (born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey, February 14, 1818 – February 20, 1895) was an American social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman. He became the most important leader of the movement for African-American civil rights in the 19th century.

After escaping from slavery in Maryland in 1838, Douglass became a national leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York and gained fame for his oratory and incisive antislavery writings. Accordingly, he was described by abolitionists in his time as a living counterexample to claims by supporters of slavery that enslaved people lacked the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens. Northerners at the time found it hard to believe that such a great orator had once been enslaved. It was in response to this disbelief that Douglass wrote his first autobiography.

Douglass wrote three autobiographies, describing his experiences as an enslaved person in his &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave&quot; (1845), which became a bestseller and was influential in promoting the cause of abolition, as was his second book, &quot;My Bondage and My Freedom&quot; (1855). Following the Civil War, Douglass was an active campaigner for the rights of freed slaves and wrote his last autobiography, &quot;Life and Times of Frederick Douglass&quot;. First published in 1881 and revised in 1892, three years before his death, the book covers his life up to those dates. Douglass also actively supported women&#x27;s suffrage, and he held several public offices. Without his knowledge or consent, Douglass became the first African American nominated for vice president of the United States, as the running mate of Victoria Woodhull on the Equal Rights Party ticket.

Douglass believed in dialogue and in making alliances across racial and ideological divides, as well as, after breaking with William Lloyd Garrison, in the anti-slavery interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. When radical abolitionists, under the motto &quot;No Union with Slaveholders&quot;, criticized Douglass&#x27;s willingness to engage in dialogue with slave owners, he replied: &quot;I would unite with anybody to do right and with nobody to do wrong.&quot;

==Early life and slavery==

Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey was born into slavery on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay in Talbot County, Maryland. The plantation was between Hillsboro and Cordova; his birthplace was likely his grandmother&#x27;s cabin east of Tappers Corner and west of Tuckahoe Creek. In his first autobiography, Douglass stated: &quot;I have no accurate knowledge of my age, never having seen any authentic record containing it.&quot; In successive autobiographies, he gave more precise estimates of when he was born, his final estimate being 1817. However, based on the extant records of Douglass&#x27;s former owner, Aaron Anthony, historian Dickson J. Preston determined that Douglass was born in February 1818. Though the exact date of his birth is unknown, he chose to celebrate February 14 as his birthday, remembering that his mother called him her &quot;Little Valentine&quot;.

=== Birth family ===

Douglass&#x27;s enslaved mother was of African descent and his father, who may have been her master, apparently of European descent; in his &quot;Narrative&quot; (1845), Douglass wrote: &quot;My father was a white man.&quot; According to David W. Blight&#x27;s 2018 biography of Douglass, &quot;For the rest of his life he searched in vain for the name of his true father.&quot; Douglass&#x27;s genetic heritage likely also included Native American. Douglass said his mother Harriet Bailey gave him his name Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey and, after he escaped to the North in September 1838, he took the surname Douglass, having already dropped his two middle names.

He later wrote of his earliest times with his mother:

The opinion was also whispered that my master was my father; but of the correctness of this opinion, I know nothing. ... My mother and I were separated when I was but an infant. ... It is a common custom, in the part of Maryland from which I ran away, to part children from their mothers at a very early age. ... I do not recollect of ever seeing my mother by the light of day. She was with me in the night. She would lie down with me, and get me to sleep, but long before I waked she was gone.

After separation from his mother during infancy, young Frederick lived with his maternal grandmother Betsy Bailey, who was also enslaved, and his maternal grandfather Isaac, who was free. Betsy would live until 1849. Frederick&#x27;s mother remained on the plantation about away, visiting Frederick only a few times before her death when he was 7 years old.

Returning much later, about 1883, to purchase land in Talbot County that was meaningful to him, he was invited to address &quot;a colored school&quot;:

===Early learning and experience===

==== The Auld family ====
At the age of 6, Douglass was separated from his grandparents and moved to the Wye House plantation, where Aaron Anthony worked as overseer and Edward Lloyd was his unofficial master. After Anthony died in 1826, Douglass was given to Lucretia Auld, wife of Thomas Auld, who sent him to serve Thomas&#x27;s brother Hugh Auld and his wife Sophia Auld in Baltimore. From the day he arrived, Sophia saw to it that Douglass was properly fed and clothed, and that he slept in a bed with sheets and a blanket. Douglass described her as a kind and tender-hearted woman, who treated him &quot;as she supposed one human being ought to treat another.&quot; Douglass felt that he was lucky to be in the city, where he said enslaved people were almost freemen, compared to those on plantations.

When Douglass was about 12, Sophia Auld began teaching him the alphabet. Hugh Auld disapproved of the tutoring, feeling that literacy would encourage enslaved people to desire freedom. Douglass later referred to this as the &quot;first decidedly antislavery lecture&quot; he had ever heard. &quot;&#x27;Very well, thought I,&#x27;&quot; wrote Douglass. &quot;&#x27;Knowledge unfits a child to be a slave.&#x27; I instinctively assented to the proposition, and from that moment I understood the direct pathway from slavery to freedom.&quot;

Under her husband&#x27;s influence, Sophia came to believe that education and slavery were incompatible and one day snatched a newspaper away from Douglass. She stopped teaching him altogether and hid all potential reading materials, including her Bible, from him. In his autobiography, Douglass related how he learned to read from white children in the neighborhood and by observing the writings of the men with whom he worked.

Douglass continued, secretly, to teach himself to read and write. He later often said, &quot;knowledge is the pathway from slavery to freedom.&quot; As Douglass began to read newspapers, pamphlets, political materials, and books of every description, this new realm of thought led him to question and condemn the institution of slavery. In later years, Douglass credited &quot;The Columbian Orator&quot;, an anthology that he discovered at about age 12, with clarifying and defining his views on freedom and human rights. First published in 1797, the book is a classroom reader, containing essays, speeches, and dialogues, to assist students in learning reading and grammar. He later learned that his mother had also been literate, about which he would later declare:

I am quite willing, and even happy, to attribute any love of letters I possess, and for which I have got—despite of prejudices—only too much credit, &quot;not&quot; to my admitted Anglo-Saxon paternity, but to the native genius of my sable, unprotected, and uncultivated &quot;mother&quot;—a woman, who belonged to a race whose mental endowments it is, at present, fashionable to hold in disparagement and contempt.

====William Freeland====
When Douglass was hired out to William Freeland, he &quot;gathered eventually more than thirty male slaves on Sundays, and sometimes even on weeknights, in a Sabbath literacy school.&quot;

====Edward Covey====
In 1833, Thomas Auld took Douglass back from Hugh (&quot;[a]s a means of punishing Hugh,&quot; Douglass later wrote). Thomas sent Douglass to work for Edward Covey, a poor farmer who had a reputation as a &quot;slave-breaker&quot;. He whipped Douglass so frequently that his wounds had little time to heal. Douglass later said the frequent whippings broke his body, soul, and spirit. The 16-year-old Douglass finally rebelled against the beatings, however, and fought back. After Douglass won a physical confrontation, Covey never tried to beat him again.

Recounting his beatings at Covey&#x27;s farm in &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave&quot;, Douglass described himself as &quot;a man transformed into a brute!&quot; Still, Douglass came to see his physical fight with Covey as life-transforming, and introduced the story in his autobiography as such: &quot;You have seen how a man was made a slave; you shall see how a slave was made a man.&quot;

==Escape from slavery==
Douglass first tried to escape from Freeland, who had hired him from his owner, but was unsuccessful. In 1837, Douglass met and fell in love with Anna Murray, a free black woman in Baltimore about five years his senior. Her free status strengthened his belief in the possibility of gaining his own freedom. Murray encouraged him and supported his efforts by aid and money.

On September 3, 1838, Douglass successfully escaped by boarding a northbound train of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad in Baltimore. The area where he boarded was formerly thought to be a short distance east of the train depot, in a recently developed neighborhood between the modern neighborhoods of Harbor East and Little Italy. This depot was at President and Fleet Streets, east of &quot;The Basin&quot; of the Baltimore harbor, on the northwest branch of the Patapsco River. Research cited in 2021, however, suggests that Douglass in fact boarded the train at the Canton Depot of the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad on Boston Street, in the Canton neighborhood of Baltimore, further east.

Douglass reached Havre de Grace, Maryland, in Harford County, in the northeast corner of the state, along the southwest shore of the Susquehanna River, which flowed into the Chesapeake Bay. Although this placed him only some from the Maryland–Pennsylvania state line, it was easier to continue by rail through Delaware, another slave state. Dressed in a sailor&#x27;s uniform provided to him by Murray, who also gave him part of her savings to cover his travel costs, he carried identification papers and protection papers that he had obtained from a free black seaman.

Douglass crossed the wide Susquehanna River by the railroad&#x27;s steam-ferry at Havre de Grace to Perryville on the opposite shore, in Cecil County, then continued by train across the state line to Wilmington, Delaware, a large port at the head of the Delaware Bay. From there, because the rail line was not yet completed, he went by steamboat along the Delaware River farther northeast to the &quot;Quaker City&quot; of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, an anti-slavery stronghold. He continued to the safe house of abolitionist David Ruggles in New York City. His entire journey to freedom took less than 24 hours. Douglass later wrote of his arrival in New York City:

Once Douglass had arrived, he sent for Murray to follow him north to New York. She brought the basic supplies for them to set up a home. They were married on September 15, 1838, by a black Presbyterian minister, just eleven days after Douglass had reached New York. At first they adopted Johnson as their married name, to divert attention.

==Religious views==
As a child, Douglass was exposed to a number of religious sermons, and in his youth, he sometimes heard Sophia Auld reading the Bible. In time, he became interested in literacy; he began reading and copying bible verses, and he eventually converted to Christianity. He described this approach in his last biography, &quot;Life and Times of Frederick Douglass&quot;:

I was not more than thirteen years old when, in my loneliness and destitution, I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners in the sight of God: that they were but natural rebels against his government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing I did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise. I consulted a good coloured man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to &quot;cast all my care upon God.&quot; This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased, and especially did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible.

Douglass was mentored by Rev. Charles Lawson, and, early in his activism, he often included biblical allusions and religious metaphors in his speeches. Although a believer, he strongly criticized religious hypocrisy and accused slaveholders of &quot;wickedness&quot;, lack of morality, and failure to follow the Golden Rule. In this sense, Douglass distinguished between the &quot;Christianity of Christ&quot; and the &quot;Christianity of America&quot; and considered religious slaveholders and clergymen who defended slavery as the most brutal, sinful, and cynical of all who represented &quot;wolves in sheep&#x27;s clothing&quot;.

In &quot;What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?&quot;, an oration Douglass gave in the Corinthian Hall of Rochester, he sharply criticized the attitude of religious people who kept silent about slavery, and he charged that ministers committed a &quot;blasphemy&quot; when they taught it as sanctioned by religion. He considered that a law passed to support slavery was &quot;one of the grossest infringements of Christian Liberty&quot; and said that pro-slavery clergymen within the American Church &quot;stripped the love of God of its beauty, and leave the throne of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form&quot;, and &quot;an abomination in the sight of God&quot;.

Of ministers like John Chase Lord, Leonard Elijah Lathrop, Ichabod Spencer, and Orville Dewey, he said that they taught, against the Scriptures, that &quot;we ought to obey man&#x27;s law before the law of God&quot;. He further asserted, &quot;in speaking of the American church, however, let it be distinctly understood that I mean the great mass of the religious organizations of our land. There are exceptions, and I thank God that there are. Noble men may be found, scattered all over these Northern States ... Henry Ward Beecher of Brooklyn, Samuel J. May of Syracuse, and my esteemed friend [Robert R. Raymonde]&quot;.

He maintained that &quot;upon these men lies the duty to inspire our ranks with high religious faith and zeal, and to cheer us on in the great mission of the slave&#x27;s redemption from his chains&quot;. In addition, he called religious people to embrace abolitionism, stating, &quot;let the religious press, the pulpit, the Sunday school, the conference meeting, the great ecclesiastical, missionary, Bible and tract associations of the land array their immense powers against slavery and slave-holding; and the whole system of crime and blood would be scattered to the winds.&quot;

During his visits to the United Kingdom between 1846 and 1848, Douglass asked British Christians never to support American churches that permitted slavery, and he expressed his happiness to know that a group of ministers in Belfast had refused to admit slaveholders as members of the Church.

On his return to the United States, Douglass founded the &quot;North Star&quot;, a weekly publication with the motto &quot;Right is of no sex, Truth is of no color, God is the Father of us all, and we are all Brethren.&quot; In his 1848 &quot;Letter to Thomas Auld&quot;, Douglass denounced his former slaveholder for leaving Douglass&#x27;s family illiterate:

Sometimes considered a precursor of a non-denominational liberation theology, Douglass was a deeply spiritual man, as his home continues to show. The fireplace mantle features busts of two of his favorite philosophers, David Friedrich Strauss, author of &quot;The Life of Jesus&quot;, and Ludwig Feuerbach, author of &quot;The Essence of Christianity&quot;. In addition to several Bibles and books about various religions in the library, images of angels and Jesus are displayed, as well as interior and exterior photographs of Washington&#x27;s Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church. Throughout his life, Douglass had linked that individual experience with social reform, and, according to John Stauffer, he, like other Christian abolitionists, followed practices such as abstaining from tobacco, alcohol and other substances that he believed corrupted body and soul. Douglass stated himself that he was a teetotaler. According to David W. Blight, however, &quot;Douglass loved cigars&quot; and received them as gifts from Ottilie Assing.

Douglass praised the agnostic orator Robert G. Ingersoll, whom Douglass met in Peoria, Illinois, stating, &quot;Genuine goodness is the same, whether found inside or outside the church, and that to be an &#x27;infidel&#x27; no more proves a man to be selfish, mean and wicked than to be evangelical proves him to be honest, just and human. Perhaps there were Christian ministers and Christian families in Peoria at that time by whom I might have been received in the same gracious manner ... but in my former visits to this place I had failed to meet them&quot;.

==Family life==
Douglass and Anna Murray had five children: Rosetta Douglass, Lewis Henry Douglass, Frederick Douglass Jr., Charles Remond Douglass, and Annie Douglass (died at the age of ten). Charles and Rosetta helped produce his newspapers.

Anna Douglass remained a loyal supporter of her husband&#x27;s public work. His relationships with Julia Griffiths and Ottilie Assing, two women with whom he was professionally involved, caused recurring speculation and scandals. Assing was a journalist recently immigrated from Germany, who first visited Douglass in 1856 seeking permission to translate &quot;My Bondage and My Freedom&quot; into German. Until 1872, she often stayed at his house &quot;for several months at a time&quot; as his &quot;intellectual and emotional companion&quot;.

Assing held Anna Douglass &quot;in utter contempt&quot; and was vainly hoping that Douglass would separate from his wife. Douglass biographer David W. Blight concludes that Assing and Douglass &quot;were probably lovers&quot;. Though Douglass and Assing are widely believed to have had an intimate relationship, the surviving correspondence contains no proof of such a relationship.

Anna died in 1882. In 1884, Douglass married Helen Pitts, a white suffragist and abolitionist from Honeoye, New York. Pitts was the daughter of Gideon Pitts Jr., an abolitionist colleague and friend of Douglass&#x27;s. A graduate of Mount Holyoke College (then called Mount Holyoke Female Seminary), Pitts worked on a radical feminist publication named &quot;Alpha&quot; while living in Washington, D.C. She later worked as Douglass&#x27;s secretary.

Assing, who had depression and was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer, committed suicide in France in 1884 after hearing of the marriage. Upon her death, Assing bequeathed Douglass a $13,000 trust fund (), a &quot;large album&quot;, and his choice of books from her library.

The marriage of Douglass and Pitts provoked a storm of controversy, since Pitts was both white and nearly 20 years younger. Many in her family stopped speaking to her; his children considered the marriage a repudiation of their mother. But feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton congratulated the couple. Douglass responded to the criticisms by saying that his first marriage had been to someone the color of his mother, and his second to someone the color of his father.

==Career==

===Abolitionist and preacher===

Frederick Douglass and Anna Murray Douglass settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts (an abolitionist center, full of former enslaved people), in 1838, moving to Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1841. After meeting and staying with Nathan and Mary Johnson, they adopted Douglass as their married name. Douglass had grown up using his mother&#x27;s surname of Bailey; after escaping slavery he had changed his surname first to Stanley and then to Johnson. In New Bedford, the latter was such a common name that he wanted one that was more distinctive, and asked Nathan Johnson to choose a suitable surname. Nathan suggested &quot;Douglass&quot;, after having read the poem &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; by Walter Scott, in which two of the principal characters have the surname &quot;Douglas&quot;.
Douglass thought of joining a white Methodist Church, but was disappointed, from the beginning, upon finding that it was segregated. Later, he joined the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, an independent black denomination first established in New York City, which counted among its members Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman. He became a licensed preacher in 1839, which helped him to hone his oratorical skills. He held various positions, including steward, Sunday-school superintendent, and sexton. In 1840, Douglass delivered a speech in Elmira, New York, then a station on the Underground Railroad, in which a black congregation would form years later, becoming the region&#x27;s largest church by 1940.

Douglass also joined several organizations in New Bedford and regularly attended abolitionist meetings. He subscribed to William Lloyd Garrison&#x27;s weekly newspaper, &quot;The Liberator&quot;. He later said that &quot;no face and form ever impressed me with such sentiments [of the hatred of slavery] as did those of William Lloyd Garrison.&quot; So deep was this influence that in his last autobiography, Douglass said &quot;his paper took a place in my heart second only to The Bible.&quot;

Garrison was likewise impressed with Douglass and had written about his anti-colonization stance in &quot;The Liberator&quot; as early as 1839. Douglass first heard Garrison speak in 1841, at a lecture that Garrison gave in Liberty Hall, New Bedford. At another meeting, Douglass was unexpectedly invited to speak. After telling his story, Douglass was encouraged to become an anti-slavery lecturer. A few days later, Douglass spoke at the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society&#x27;s annual convention, in Nantucket. Then 23 years old, Douglass conquered his nervousness and gave an eloquent speech about his life as a slave.
While living in Lynn, Douglass engaged in an early protest against segregated transportation. In September 1841, at Lynn Central Square station, Douglass and his friend James N. Buffum were thrown off an Eastern Railroad train because Douglass refused to sit in the segregated railroad coach.

In 1843, Douglass joined other speakers in the American Anti-Slavery Society&#x27;s &quot;Hundred Conventions&quot; project, a six-month tour at meeting halls throughout the eastern and midwestern United States. During this tour, slavery supporters frequently accosted Douglass. At a lecture in Pendleton, Indiana, an angry mob chased and beat Douglass before a local Quaker family, the Hardys, rescued him. His hand was broken in the attack; it healed improperly and bothered him for the rest of his life. A stone marker in Falls Park in the Pendleton Historic District commemorates this event.

In 1847, Douglass explained to Garrison, &quot;I have no love for America, as such; I have no patriotism. I have no country. What country have I? The Institutions of this Country do not know me – do not recognize me as a man.&quot;

===Autobiography===
Douglass&#x27;s best-known work is his first autobiography, &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave&quot;, written during his time in Lynn, Massachusetts and published in 1845. At the time, some skeptics questioned whether a black man could have produced such an eloquent piece of literature. The book received generally positive reviews and became an immediate bestseller. Within three years, it had been reprinted nine times, with 11,000 copies circulating in the United States. It was also translated into French and Dutch and published in Europe.

Douglass published three autobiographies during his lifetime (and revised the third of these), each time expanding on the previous one. The 1845 &quot;Narrative&quot; was his biggest seller and probably allowed him to raise the funds to gain his legal freedom the following year, as discussed below. In 1855, Douglass published &quot;My Bondage and My Freedom&quot;. In 1881, in his sixties, Douglass published &quot;Life and Times of Frederick Douglass&quot;, which he revised in 1892.

===Travels to Ireland and Great Britain===


Douglass&#x27;s friends and mentors feared that the publicity would draw the attention of his ex-owner, Hugh Auld, who might try to get his &quot;property&quot; back. They encouraged Douglass to tour Ireland, as many former slaves had done. Douglass set sail on the &quot;Cambria&quot; for Liverpool, England, on August 16, 1845. He traveled in Ireland as the Great Famine was beginning.

The feeling of freedom from American racial discrimination amazed Douglass:

Eleven days and a half gone, and I have crossed three thousand miles of the perilous deep. Instead of a democratic government, I am under a monarchical government. Instead of the bright, blue sky of America, I am covered with the soft, grey fog of the Emerald Isle [Ireland]. I breathe, and lo! the chattel [slave] becomes a man. I gaze around in vain for one who will question my equal humanity, claim me as his slave, or offer me an insult. I employ a cab—I am seated beside white people—I reach the hotel—I enter the same door—I am shown into the same parlor—I dine at the same table—and no one is offended... I find myself regarded and treated at every turn with the kindness and deference paid to white people. When I go to church, I am met by no upturned nose and scornful lip to tell me, ″&quot;We don&#x27;t allow niggers in here!&quot;″

Still, Douglass was astounded by the extreme levels of poverty he encountered in Dublin, much of it reminding him of his experiences in slavery. In a letter to William Lloyd Garrison, Douglass wrote &quot;I see much here to remind me of my former condition, and I confess I should be ashamed to lift up my voice against American slavery, but that I know the cause of humanity is one the world over. He who really and truly feels for the American slave, cannot steel his heart to the woes of others; and he who thinks himself an abolitionist, yet cannot enter into the wrongs of others, has yet to find a true foundation for his anti-slavery faith.&quot;

He also met and befriended the Irish nationalist and strident abolitionist Daniel O&#x27;Connell, who was to be a great inspiration.

Douglass spent two years in Ireland and Great Britain, lecturing in churches and chapels. His draw was such that some facilities were &quot;crowded to suffocation&quot;. One example was his hugely popular &quot;London Reception Speech&quot;, which Douglass delivered in May 1846 at Alexander Fletcher&#x27;s Finsbury Chapel. Douglass remarked that in England he was treated not &quot;as a color, but as a man&quot;.

In 1846, Douglass met with Thomas Clarkson, one of the last living British abolitionists, who had persuaded Parliament to abolish slavery in Great Britain&#x27;s colonies. During this trip Douglass became legally free, as British supporters led by Anna Richardson and her sister-in-law Ellen of Newcastle upon Tyne raised funds to buy his freedom from his American owner Thomas Auld. Many supporters tried to encourage Douglass to remain in England but, with his wife still in Massachusetts and three million of his black brethren in bondage in the United States, he returned to America in the spring of 1847, soon after the death of Daniel O&#x27;Connell.

In the 21st century, historical plaques were installed on buildings in Cork and Waterford, Ireland, and London to celebrate Douglass&#x27;s visit: the first is on the Imperial Hotel in Cork and was unveiled on August 31, 2012; the second is on the façade of Waterford City Hall, unveiled on October 7, 2013. It commemorates his speech there on October 9, 1845. The third plaque adorns Nell Gwynn House, South Kensington in London, at the site of an earlier house where Douglass stayed with the British abolitionist George Thompson. On July 31, 2023, the first statue of him in Europe was unveiled in High Street in Belfast.

Douglass spent time in Scotland and was appointed &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Antislavery agent&quot;. He made anti-slavery speeches and wrote letters back to the US. He considered the city of Edinburgh to be elegant, grand and very welcoming. Maps of the places in the city that were important to his stay are held by the National Library of Scotland. A plaque and a mural at 33 Gilmore Place in Edinburgh mark his stay there in 1846.

&quot;A variety of collaborative projects are currently [in 2021] underway to commemorate Frederick Douglass&#x27;s journey and visit to Ireland in the 19th century.&quot;

===Return to the United States; the abolitionist movement===

After returning to the U.S. in 1847, using £500 () given to him by English supporters, Douglass started publishing his first abolitionist newspaper, the &quot;North Star&quot;, from the basement of the Memorial AME Zion Church in Rochester, New York. Originally, Pittsburgh journalist Martin Delany was co-editor but Douglass didn&#x27;t feel he brought in enough subscriptions, and they parted ways. The &quot;North Star&quot; motto was &quot;Right is of no Sex – Truth is of no Color – God is the Father of us all, and we are all brethren.&quot; The AME Church and &quot;North Star&quot; joined in the freedmen community&#x27;s vigorous opposition to the mostly white American Colonization Society and its proposal to send free black people to Africa. Douglass also participated in the Underground Railroad. He and his wife provided lodging and resources in their home to more than four hundred fugitive slaves.

Douglass also soon split with Garrison, whom he found unwilling to support actions against American slavery. Earlier Douglass had agreed with Garrison&#x27;s position that the Constitution was pro-slavery, because of the Three-Fifths Clause, the compromise that provided that 60 percent of the number of enslaved people would be added to &quot;the whole Number of free Persons&quot; for the purpose of apportioning congressional seats; and protection of the international slave trade through 1807. Garrison had burned copies of the Constitution to express his opinion. However, Lysander Spooner published &quot;The Unconstitutionality of Slavery&quot; (1846), which examined the United States Constitution as an antislavery document. Douglass&#x27;s change of opinion about the Constitution and his splitting from Garrison around 1847 became one of the abolitionist movement&#x27;s most notable divisions. Douglass angered Garrison by saying that the Constitution could and should be used as an instrument in the fight against slavery.

On July 24, 1851, &quot;shortly after his announced change of opinion&quot;, Douglass delivered a speech titled, &quot;Is the United States Constitution For or Against Slavery&quot;. He expressed his changed views again in an 1860 speech in Glasgow, Scotland, titled, &quot;The Constitution of the United States: is it pro-slavery or anti-slavery?&quot;. In that speech, he said, &quot;When I escaped from slavery, and was introduced to the Garrisonians, I adopted very many of their opinions... I was young, had read but little, and naturally took some things on trust. Subsequent reading and experience&quot;, however, &quot;brought me to other conclusions&quot;. He now believed that &quot;dissolution of the American Union&quot;, which Garrison advocated, &quot;would place the slave system more exclusively under the control of the slaveholding States...&quot; In addition, &quot;Mr. Garrison and his friends tell us that while in the Union we are responsible for slavery... I deny that going out of the Union would free us from that responsibility... The American people in the Northern States have helped to enslave the black people. Their duty will not be done till they give them back their plundered rights.&quot;

===Letter to his former owner===
In September 1848, on the tenth anniversary of his escape, Douglass published an open letter addressed to his former master, Thomas Auld, berating him for his conduct, and inquiring after members of his family still held by Auld. In the course of the letter, Douglass adeptly transitions from formal and restrained to familiar and then to impassioned. At one point he is the proud parent, describing his improved circumstances and the progress of his own four young children. But then he dramatically shifts tone:

Oh! sir, a slaveholder never appears to me so completely an agent of hell, as when I think of and look upon my dear children. It is then that my feelings rise above my control. ... The grim horrors of slavery rise in all their ghastly terror before me, the wails of millions pierce my heart, and chill my blood. I remember the chain, the gag, the bloody whip, the deathlike gloom overshadowing the broken spirit of the fettered bondman, the appalling liability of his being torn away from wife and children, and sold like a beast in the market.

In a graphic passage, Douglass asked Auld how he would feel if Douglass had come to take away his daughter Amanda into slavery, treating her the way he and members of his family had been treated by Auld. Yet in his conclusion Douglass shows his focus and benevolence, stating that he has &quot;no malice towards him personally,&quot; and asserts that, &quot;there is no roof under which you would be more safe than mine, and there is nothing in my house which you might need for comfort, which I would not readily grant. Indeed, I should esteem it a privilege, to set you an example as to how mankind ought to treat each other.&quot;

===Women&#x27;s rights===
In 1848, Douglass was the only black person to attend the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women&#x27;s rights convention, in upstate New York. Elizabeth Cady Stanton asked the assembly to pass a resolution asking for women&#x27;s suffrage. Many of those present opposed the idea, including influential Quakers James and Lucretia Mott. Douglass stood and spoke eloquently in favor of women&#x27;s suffrage; he said that he could not accept the right to vote as a black man if women could also not claim that right. He suggested that the world would be a better place if women were involved in the political sphere:

After Douglass&#x27;s powerful words, the attendees passed the resolution.

In the wake of the Seneca Falls Convention, Douglass used an editorial in &quot;The North Star&quot; to press the case for women&#x27;s rights. He recalled the &quot;marked ability and dignity&quot; of the proceedings, and briefly conveyed several arguments of the convention and feminist thought at the time.

On the first count, Douglass acknowledged the &quot;decorum&quot; of the participants in the face of disagreement. In the remainder, he discussed the primary document that emerged from the conference, a Declaration of Sentiments, and the &quot;infant&quot; feminist cause. He criticized opponents of women&#x27;s rights: &quot;A discussion of the rights of animals would be regarded with far more complacency by many of what are called the &quot;wise&quot; and the &quot;good&quot; of our land, than would be a discussion of the rights of woman.&quot; He also noted the link between abolitionism and feminism, the overlap between the communities.

His opinion as the editor of a prominent newspaper carried weight, and he stated the position of the &quot;North Star&quot; explicitly: &quot;We hold woman to be justly entitled to all we claim for man.&quot; This letter, written a week after the convention, reaffirmed the first part of the paper&#x27;s slogan, &quot;right is of no sex.&quot;
After the Civil War, when the 15th Amendment giving black men the right to vote was being debated, Douglass split with the Stanton-led faction of the women&#x27;s rights movement. Douglass supported the amendment, which would grant suffrage to black men. Stanton opposed the 15th Amendment because it limited the expansion of suffrage to black men; she predicted its passage would delay for decades the cause for women&#x27;s right to vote. Stanton argued that American women and black men should band together to fight for universal suffrage, and opposed any bill that split the issues. Douglass and Stanton both knew that there was not yet enough male support for women&#x27;s right to vote, but that an amendment giving black men the vote could pass in the late 1860s. Stanton wanted to attach women&#x27;s suffrage to that of black men so that her cause would be carried to success.

Douglass thought such a strategy was too risky, that there was barely enough support for black men&#x27;s suffrage. He feared that linking the cause of women&#x27;s suffrage to that of black men would result in failure for both. Douglass argued that white women, already empowered by their social connections to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. Black women, he believed, would have the same degree of empowerment as white women once black men had the vote. Douglass assured the American women that at no time had he ever argued against women&#x27;s right to vote.

===Ideological refinement===

In 1850, Douglass was elected the vice president of the American League of Colored Laborers, the first black labor union in the United States, which he had also helped found. Meanwhile, in 1851, he merged the &quot;North Star&quot; with Gerrit Smith&#x27;s Liberty Party paper to form &quot;Frederick Douglass&#x27; Paper&quot;, which was published until 1859.

On July 5, 1852, Douglass delivered an address in Corinthian Hall at a meeting organized by the Rochester Ladies&#x27; Anti-Slavery Society. This speech eventually became known as &quot;What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?&quot;; one biographer called it &quot;perhaps the greatest antislavery oration ever given.&quot; In 1853, he was a prominent attendee of the radical abolitionist National African American Convention in Rochester. Douglass was one of five people whose names were attached to the address of the convention to the people of the United States published under the title, &quot;The Claims of Our Common Cause&quot;. The other four were Amos Noë Freeman, James Monroe Whitfield, Henry O. Wagoner, and George Boyer Vashon.

Like many abolitionists, Douglass believed that education would be crucial for African Americans to improve their lives; he was an early advocate for school desegregation. In the 1850s, Douglass observed that New York&#x27;s facilities and instruction for African American children were vastly inferior to those for European Americans. Douglass called for court action to open all schools to all children. He said that full inclusion within the educational system was a more pressing need for African Americans than political issues such as suffrage.

===John Brown===
On March 12, 1859, Douglass met with radical abolitionists John Brown, George DeBaptiste, and others at William Webb&#x27;s house in Detroit to discuss emancipation. Douglass met Brown again when Brown visited his home two months before leading the raid on Harpers Ferry. Brown penned his Provisional Constitution during his two-week stay with Douglass. Also staying with Douglass for over a year was Shields Green, a fugitive slave whom Douglass was helping, as he often did.

Shortly before the raid, Douglass, taking Green with him, travelled from Rochester, via New York City, to Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, Brown&#x27;s communications headquarters. He was recognized there by black people, who asked him for a lecture. Douglass agreed, although he said his only topic was slavery. Green joined him on the stage; Brown, , sat in the audience. A white reporter, referring to &quot;Nigger Democracy&quot;, called it a &quot;flaming address&quot; by &quot;the notorious Negro Orator&quot;.

There, in an abandoned stone quarry for secrecy, Douglass and Green met with Brown and John Henri Kagi, to discuss the raid. After discussions lasting, as Douglass put it, &quot;a day and a night&quot;, he disappointed Brown by declining to join him, considering the mission suicidal. To Douglass&#x27;s surprise, Green went with Brown instead of returning to Rochester with Douglass. Anne Brown said that Green told her that Douglass promised to pay him on his return, but David Blight called this &quot;much more ex post facto bitterness than reality&quot;.

Almost all that is known about this incident comes from Douglass. It is clear that it was of immense importance to him, both as a turning point in his life—not accompanying John Brown—and its importance in his public image. The meeting was not revealed by Douglass for 20 years. He first disclosed it in his speech on John Brown at Storer College in 1881, trying unsuccessfully to raise money to support a John Brown professorship at Storer, to be held by a black man. He again referred to it stunningly in his last &quot;Autobiography&quot;.

After the raid, which took place between October 16 and 18, 1859, Douglass was accused both of supporting Brown and of not supporting him enough. He was nearly arrested on a Virginia warrant, and fled for a brief time to Canada before proceeding onward to England on a previously planned lecture tour, arriving near the end of November. During his lecture tour of Great Britain, on March 26, 1860, Douglass delivered a speech before the Scottish Anti-Slavery Society in Glasgow, &quot;The Constitution of the United States: is it pro-slavery or anti-slavery?&quot;, outlining his views on the American Constitution. That month, on the 13th, Douglass&#x27;s youngest daughter Annie died in Rochester, New York, at age 10. Douglass sailed back from England the following month, traveling through Canada to avoid detection.

Years later, in 1881, Douglass shared a stage at Storer College in Harpers Ferry with Andrew Hunter, the prosecutor who secured Brown&#x27;s conviction and execution. Hunter congratulated Douglass.

===Photography===
Douglass considered photography very important in ending slavery and racism, and believed that the camera would not lie, even in the hands of a racist white person, as photographs were an excellent counter to many racist caricatures, particularly in blackface minstrelsy. He was the most photographed American of the 19th century, consciously using photography to advance his political views. He never smiled, specifically so as not to play into the racist caricature of a happy enslaved person. He tended to look directly into the camera and confront the viewer with a stern look.

==Civil War years==
===Before the Civil War===
By the time of the Civil War, Douglass was one of the most famous black men in the country, known for his orations on the condition of the black race and on other issues such as women&#x27;s rights. His eloquence gathered crowds at every location. His reception by leaders in England and Ireland added to his stature.

He had been seriously proposed for the congressional seat of his friend and supporter Gerrit Smith, who declined to run again after his term ended in 1854. Smith recommended to him that he not run, because there were &quot;strenuous objections&quot; from members of Congress. The possibility &quot;afflicted some with convulsions, others with panic, more with an astonishing flow of exceedingly select and nervous language&quot;, &quot;giving vent to all sorts of linguistic enormities.&quot; If the House agreed to seat him, which was unlikely, all the Southern members would walk out, so the country would finally be split. No black person would serve in Congress until 1870, just after the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment.

===Fight for emancipation and suffrage===

Douglass and the abolitionists argued that because the aim of the Civil War was to end slavery, African Americans should be allowed to engage in the fight for their freedom. Douglass publicized this view in his newspapers and several speeches. After Lincoln had finally allowed black soldiers to serve in the Union army, Douglass helped the recruitment efforts, publishing his famous broadside &quot;Men of Color to Arms!&quot; on March 21, 1863. His eldest son, Charles Douglass, joined the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, but was ill for much of his service. Lewis Douglass fought at the Battle of Fort Wagner. Another son, Frederick Douglass Jr., also served as a recruiter.

With the North no longer obliged to return slaves to their owners in the South, Douglass fought for equality for his people. Douglass conferred with President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 on the treatment of black soldiers and on plans to move liberated slaves out of the South.

President Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation, which took effect on January 1, 1863, declared the freedom of all slaves in Confederate-held territory. (Slaves in Union-held areas were not covered because the proclamation was permissible under the Constitution only as a war measure; they were freed with the adoption of the 13th Amendment on December 6, 1865.) Douglass described the spirit of those awaiting the proclamation: &quot;We were waiting and listening as for a bolt from the sky ... we were watching ... by the dim light of the stars for the dawn of a new day ... we were longing for the answer to the agonizing prayers of centuries.&quot;

During the U.S. Presidential Election of 1864, Douglass supported John C. Frémont, who was the candidate of the abolitionist Radical Democracy Party. Douglass was disappointed that President Lincoln did not publicly endorse suffrage for black freedmen. Douglass believed that since African American men were fighting for the Union in the American Civil War, they deserved the right to vote.

===After Lincoln&#x27;s death===
The postwar ratification of the 13th Amendment, on December 6, 1865, outlawed slavery, &quot;except as a punishment for crime.&quot; The 14th Amendment provided for birthright citizenship and prohibited the states from abridging the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States or denying any &quot;person&quot; due process of law or equal protection of the laws. The 15th Amendment protected all citizens from being discriminated against in voting because of race. After Lincoln had been assassinated, Douglass conferred with President Andrew Johnson on the subject of black suffrage.
On April 14, 1876, Douglass delivered the keynote speech at the unveiling of the Emancipation Memorial in Washington&#x27;s Lincoln Park. He spoke frankly about the complex legacy of Lincoln, noting what he perceived as both positive and negative attributes of the late President. Calling Lincoln &quot;the white man&#x27;s President&quot;, Douglass criticized Lincoln&#x27;s tardiness in joining the cause of emancipation, noting that Lincoln initially opposed the expansion of slavery but did not support its elimination: &quot;He had been ready and willing at any time during the first years of his administration to deny, postpone, and sacrifice the humanity of the colored people to promote the welfare of the white people. Lincoln was neither our man or our model&quot;. But Douglass also asked, &quot;Can any colored man, or any white man friendly to the freedom of all men, ever forget the night which followed the first day of January 1863, when the world was to see if Abraham Lincoln would prove to be as good as his word?&quot; He also said: &quot;Though Mr. Lincoln shared the prejudices of his white fellow-countrymen against the Negro, it is hardly necessary to say that in his heart of hearts he loathed and hated slavery...&quot; Most famously, he added: &quot;Viewed from the genuine abolition ground, Mr. Lincoln seemed tardy, cold, dull, and indifferent; but measuring him by the sentiment of his country, a sentiment he was bound as a statesman to consult, he was swift, zealous, radical, and determined.&quot;

The crowd, roused by his speech, gave Douglass a standing ovation. Lincoln&#x27;s widow Mary Lincoln supposedly gave Lincoln&#x27;s favorite walking-stick to Douglass in appreciation. That walking stick still rests in his final residence, &quot;Cedar Hill&quot; in Washington, D.C., now preserved as the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site.

After delivering the speech, Douglass immediately wrote to the National Republican newspaper in Washington (which published his letter five days later, on April 19), criticizing the statue&#x27;s design and suggesting the park could be improved by more dignified monuments of free black people. &quot;The negro here, though rising, is still on his knees and nude,&quot; Douglass wrote. &quot;What I want to see before I die is a monument representing the negro, not couchant on his knees like a four-footed animal, but erect on his feet like a man.&quot;

==Reconstruction era==
After the Civil War, Douglass continued to work for equality for African Americans and women. Due to his prominence and activism during the war, Douglass received several political appointments. He served as president of the Reconstruction-era Freedman&#x27;s Savings Bank.

Meanwhile, white insurgents had quickly arisen in the South after the war, organizing first as secret vigilante groups, including the Ku Klux Klan. Armed insurgency took different forms. Powerful paramilitary groups included the White League and the Red Shirts, both active during the 1870s in the Deep South. They operated as &quot;the military arm of the Democratic Party&quot;, turning out Republican officeholders and disrupting elections. Starting 10 years after the war, Democrats regained political power in every state of the former Confederacy and began to reassert white supremacy. They enforced this by a combination of violence, late 19th-century laws imposing segregation and a concerted effort to disfranchise African Americans. New labor and criminal laws also limited their freedom.

To combat these efforts, Douglass supported the presidential campaign of Ulysses S. Grant in 1868. In 1870, Douglass started his last newspaper, the &quot;New National Era&quot;, attempting to hold his country to its commitment to equality. President Grant sent a congressionally sponsored commission, accompanied by Douglass, on a mission to the West Indies to investigate whether the annexation of Santo Domingo would be good for the United States. Grant believed annexation would help relieve the violent situation in the South by allowing African Americans their own state. Douglass and the commission favored annexation, but Congress remained opposed to annexation. Douglass criticized Senator Charles Sumner, who opposed annexation, stating that if Sumner continued to oppose annexation he would &quot;regard him as the worst foe the colored race has on this continent.&quot;

After the midterm elections, Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act) and the second and third Enforcement Acts. Grant used their provisions vigorously, suspending &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in South Carolina and sending troops there and into other states. Under his leadership over 5,000 arrests were made. Grant&#x27;s vigor in disrupting the Klan made him unpopular among many whites but earned praise from Douglass. A Douglass associate wrote that African Americans &quot;will ever cherish a grateful remembrance of [Grant&#x27;s] name, fame and great services.&quot;

In 1872, Douglass became the first African American nominated for Vice President of the United States, as Victoria Woodhull&#x27;s running mate on the Equal Rights Party ticket. He was nominated without his knowledge. Douglass neither campaigned for the ticket nor acknowledged that he had been nominated. In that year, he was presidential elector at large for the State of New York, and took that state&#x27;s votes to Washington, D.C.

However, in early June of that year, Douglass&#x27;s third Rochester home, on South Avenue, burned down; arson was suspected. There was extensive damage to the house, its furnishings, and the grounds; in addition, sixteen volumes of the &quot;North Star&quot; and &quot;Frederick Douglass&#x27; Paper&quot; were lost. Douglass then moved to Washington, D.C.

Throughout the Reconstruction era, Douglass continued speaking, emphasizing the importance of work, voting rights and actual exercise of suffrage. His speeches for the twenty-five years following the war emphasized work to counter the racism that was then prevalent in unions. In a November 15, 1867, speech he said: In an 1869 speech entitled &quot;Our Composite Nationality,&quot; Douglass spoke in defense of Chinese immigration to the United States, their admission &quot;as witnesses in our courts of law&quot;, their naturalization as citizens, and their right to vote and to hold office. This was at a time when even many fellow Republicans expressed anti-Chinese sentiment and opposed their immigration and the other rights that Douglass named. Describing the freedom to immigrate as a human right, Douglass argued, &quot;I hold that a liberal and brotherly welcome to all who are likely to come to the United States is the only wise policy which this nation can adopt.&quot; 

Douglass spoke at many colleges around the country, including Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, in 1873.

In 1881, at Storer College in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, Douglass delivered a speech praising John Brown and revealing unknown information about their relationship, including their meeting in an abandoned stone quarry near Chambersburg shortly before the raid.

==Frederick Douglass House==
In 1877 Frederick Douglass bought a house in Washington, D.C., that included a big yard, as well as a studio where he did most of his work; he lived in this house from 1878 until his death in 1895, and it was named the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site.

==Final years in Washington, D.C.==
The Freedman&#x27;s Savings Bank went bankrupt on June 29, 1874, just a few months after Douglass became its president in late March. During that same economic crisis, his final newspaper, &quot;The New National Era&quot;, failed in September. When Republican Rutherford B. Hayes was elected president, he named Douglass United States Marshal for the District of Columbia, making him the first person of color to be so named. The United States Senate voted to confirm him on March 17, 1877. Douglass accepted the appointment, which helped assure his family&#x27;s financial security. During his tenure, Douglass was urged by his supporters to resign from his commission, since he was never asked to introduce visiting foreign dignitaries to the President, which is one of the usual duties of that post. However, Douglass believed that no covert racism was implied by the omission and stated that he was always warmly welcomed in presidential circles.

In 1877, Douglass visited his former enslaver Thomas Auld on his deathbed, and the two men reconciled. Douglass had met Auld&#x27;s daughter, Amanda Auld Sears, some years prior. She had requested the meeting and had subsequently attended and cheered one of Douglass&#x27;s speeches. Her father complimented her for reaching out to Douglass. The visit also appears to have brought closure to Douglass, although some criticized his effort.

That same year, Douglass bought the house that was to be the family&#x27;s final home in Washington, D.C., on a hill above the Anacostia River. He and Anna named it &quot;Cedar Hill&quot; (also spelled &quot;CedarHill&quot;). They expanded the house from 14 to 21 rooms and included a china closet. One year later, Douglass purchased adjoining lots and expanded the property to 15 acres (61,000 m2). The home is now preserved as the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site.

In 1881, Douglass published the final edition of his autobiography, &quot;The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass&quot;, which he updated in 1892. In 1881, he was appointed Recorder of Deeds for the District of Columbia. His wife Anna Murray Douglass died in 1882, leaving the widower devastated. After a period of mourning, Douglass found new meaning from working with activist Ida B. Wells. He remarried in 1884, as mentioned above.

Douglass also continued his speaking engagements and travel, both in the United States and abroad. With new wife Helen, Douglass toured the UK including Wales (possibly by invitation from abolitionist Jessie Donaldson), Ireland, France, Italy, Egypt, and Greece from 1886 to 1887. He became known for advocating Irish Home Rule and supported Charles Stewart Parnell in Ireland.

At the 1888 Republican National Convention, Douglass became the first African American to receive a vote for President of the United States in a major party&#x27;s roll call vote. That year, Douglass spoke at Claflin College, a historically black college in Orangeburg, South Carolina, and the state&#x27;s oldest such institution.

Many African Americans, called Exodusters, escaped the Klan and racially discriminatory laws in the South by moving to Kansas, where some formed all-black towns to have a greater level of freedom and autonomy. Douglass favored neither this nor the Back-to-Africa movement. He thought the latter resembled the American Colonization Society, which he had opposed in his youth. In 1892, at an Indianapolis conference convened by Bishop Henry McNeal Turner, Douglass spoke out against the separatist movements, urging African Americans to stick it out. He made similar speeches as early as 1879 and was criticized both by fellow leaders and some audiences, who even booed him for this position. Speaking in Baltimore in 1894, Douglass said, &quot;I hope and trust all will come out right in the end, but the immediate future looks dark and troubled. I cannot shut my eyes to the ugly facts before me.&quot;

President Harrison appointed Douglass as the United States&#x27;s minister resident and consul-general to the Republic of Haiti and Chargé d&#x27;affaires for Santo Domingo in 1889, but Douglass resigned the commission in July 1891 when it became apparent that the American President was intent upon gaining permanent access to Haitian territory regardless of that country&#x27;s desires. In 1892, Haiti made Douglass a co-commissioner of its pavilion at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

In 1892, Douglass constructed rental housing for blacks, now known as Douglass Place, in the Fells Point area of Baltimore. The complex still exists, and in 2003 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Death==
On February 20, 1895, Douglass attended a meeting of the National Council of Women in Washington, D.C. During that meeting, he was brought to the platform and received a standing ovation. Shortly after he returned home, Douglass died of a heart attack. He was 77.

His funeral was held at the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church. Although Douglass had attended several churches in the nation&#x27;s capital, he had a pew here and had donated two standing candelabras when this church had moved to a new building in 1886. He also gave many lectures there, including his last major speech, &quot;The Lessons of the Hour&quot;.

Thousands of people passed by his coffin to show their respect. United States senators and Supreme Court justices were pallbearers. Jeremiah Rankin, president of Howard University, delivered &quot;a masterly address&quot;. A letter from Elizabeth Cady Stanton was read. The Secretary of the Haitian Legation &quot;expressed the condolence of his country in melodious French.&quot;

Douglass&#x27;s coffin was transported to Rochester, New York, where he had lived for 25 years, longer than anywhere else in his life. His body was received in state at City Hall, flags were flown at half mast, and schools adjourned. He was buried next to Anna in the Douglass family plot of Mount Hope Cemetery. Helen was also buried there, in 1903. His grave is, with that of Susan B. Anthony, the most visited in the cemetery. A marker, erected by the University of Rochester and other friends, describes him as &quot;escaped slave, abolitionist, suffragist, journalist and statesman, founder of the Civil Rights Movement in America&quot;.

===Poetry===
* 1847. &quot;Liberty&quot;, an eight-line poem, was written by Douglass in his notebook on September 13, 1847, in Cleveland, Ohio. Since mid-August he and William Lloyd Garrison, on a Western tour for the abolitionist movement, had been traveling through Ohio, where their receptions ranged from hospitable to enthusiastic. This raised Douglass&#x27;s spirits considerably after he had faced an onslaught of &quot;rotten eggs and all manner of stones and brickbats&quot; while speaking a few weeks earlier in the courthouse at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. As a result of his receptions in Ohio, he was moved to write poetry on at least one other occasion in that state after he had written the poem &quot;Liberty&quot;. The handwritten poem is now held in the Xavier University of Louisiana, Archives &amp; Special Collections.

==Legacy and honors==


Biographer David Blight states that Douglass &quot;played a pivotal role in America&#x27;s Second Founding out of the apocalypse of the Civil War, and he very much wished to see himself as a founder and a defender of the Second American Republic.&quot;

Roy Finkenbine argues:

The most influential African American of the nineteenth century, Douglass made a career of agitating the American conscience. He spoke and wrote on behalf of a variety of reform causes: women&#x27;s rights, temperance, peace, land reform, free public education, and the abolition of capital punishment. But he devoted the bulk of his time, immense talent, and boundless energy to ending slavery and gaining equal rights for African Americans. These were the central concerns of his long reform career. Douglass understood that the struggle for emancipation and equality demanded forceful, persistent, and unyielding agitation. And he recognized that African Americans must play a conspicuous role in that struggle. Less than a month before his death, when a young black man solicited his advice to an African American just starting out in the world, Douglass replied without hesitation: ″Agitate! Agitate! Agitate!″

The Episcopal Church remembers Douglass with a Lesser Feast annually on its liturgical calendar for February 20, the anniversary of his death. Many public schools have also been named in his honor. Douglass still has living descendants today, such as Ken Morris, who is also a descendant of Booker T. Washington. Other honors and remembrances include:
* In 1871, a bust of Douglass was unveiled at Sibley Hall, University of Rochester.

===Painting===
* In 1938–39, African-American artist Jacob Lawrence created &quot;The Frederick Douglass&quot; series of narrative paintings. They were part of the historical series started by Lawrence in 1937, which included painted panels about prominent Black historical figures such as Toussaint Louverture and Harriet Tubman. During his preparatory work, Lawrence conducted research at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, drawing primarily from the autobiographies of Frederick Douglass: &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave&quot; (1845) and &quot;Life and Times of Frederick Douglass&quot; (1881). For this series the artist used a multipanel-plus-caption format that allowed him to develop a serial narrative that was not possible to convey by means of traditional portrait or history painting. Instead of reproducing Douglass&#x27;s original narratives verbatim, Lawrence constructed his own visual and textual narrative in the form of 32 panels painted in tempera and accompanied with Lawrence&#x27;s own captions. The structure of the painting series is linear and consists of three parts (the slave, the fugitive, the free man) which offer an epic chronicle of Douglass&#x27;s transformation from slave to leader in the struggle for the liberation of black people. &quot;The Frederick Douglass&quot; series is currently in the Hampton University Museum.

* In 2024, the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History &amp; Culture in Baltimore put up a mural by artist Adam Himoff portraying Douglass &quot;posed in a slim, European-cut suit, high-top white Converse sneakers, and an oversized wristwatch&quot;.

<text>In physics, physical chemistry and engineering, fluid dynamics is a subdiscipline of fluid mechanics that describes the flow of fluids – liquids and gases. It has several subdisciplines, including (the study of air and other gases in motion) and (the study of water and other liquids in motion). Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating forces and moments on aircraft, determining the mass flow rate of petroleum through pipelines, predicting weather patterns, understanding nebulae in interstellar space and modelling fission weapon detonation.

Fluid dynamics offers a systematic structure—which underlies these practical disciplines—that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from flow measurement and used to solve practical problems. The solution to a fluid dynamics problem typically involves the calculation of various properties of the fluid, such as flow velocity, pressure, density, and temperature, as functions of space and time.

Before the twentieth century, &quot;hydrodynamics&quot; was synonymous with fluid dynamics. This is still reflected in names of some fluid dynamics topics, like magnetohydrodynamics and hydrodynamic stability, both of which can also be applied to gases.

==Equations==

The foundational axioms of fluid dynamics are the conservation laws, specifically, conservation of mass, conservation of linear momentum, and conservation of energy (also known as the &quot;first law of thermodynamics&quot;). These are based on classical mechanics and are modified in quantum mechanics and general relativity. They are expressed using the Reynolds transport theorem.

In addition to the above, fluids are assumed to obey the continuum assumption. At small scale, all fluids are composed of molecules that collide with one another and solid objects. However, the continuum assumption assumes that fluids are continuous, rather than discrete. Consequently, it is assumed that properties such as density, pressure, temperature, and flow velocity are well-defined at infinitesimally small points in space and vary continuously from one point to another. The fact that the fluid is made up of discrete molecules is ignored.

For fluids that are sufficiently dense to be a continuum, do not contain ionized species, and have flow velocities that are small in relation to the speed of light, the momentum equations for Newtonian fluids are the Navier–Stokes equations—which is a non-linear set of differential equations that describes the flow of a fluid whose stress depends linearly on flow velocity gradients and pressure. The unsimplified equations do not have a general closed-form solution, so they are primarily of use in computational fluid dynamics. The equations can be simplified in several ways, all of which make them easier to solve. Some of the simplifications allow some simple fluid dynamics problems to be solved in closed form.

In addition to the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations, a thermodynamic equation of state that gives the pressure as a function of other thermodynamic variables is required to completely describe the problem. An example of this would be the perfect gas equation of state:

:formula_1

where is pressure, is density, and is the absolute temperature, while is the gas constant and is molar mass for a particular gas. A constitutive relation may also be useful.

===Conservation laws===
Three conservation laws are used to solve fluid dynamics problems, and may be written in integral or differential form. The conservation laws may be applied to a region of the flow called a &quot;control volume&quot;. A control volume is a discrete volume in space through which fluid is assumed to flow. The integral formulations of the conservation laws are used to describe the change of mass, momentum, or energy within the control volume. Differential formulations of the conservation laws apply Stokes&#x27; theorem to yield an expression that may be interpreted as the integral form of the law applied to an infinitesimally small volume (at a point) within the flow.

{D t} = \mathbf{F} - \frac{\nabla p}{\rho} &lt;/math&gt;

In aerodynamics, air is assumed to be a Newtonian fluid, which posits a linear relationship between the shear stress (due to internal friction forces) and the rate of strain of the fluid. The equation above is a vector equation in a three-dimensional flow, but it can be expressed as three scalar equations in three coordinate directions. The conservation of momentum equations for the compressible, viscous flow case is called the Navier–Stokes equations.}}

== Classifications ==

===Compressible versus incompressible flow===
All fluids are compressible to an extent; that is, changes in pressure or temperature cause changes in density. However, in many situations the changes in pressure and temperature are sufficiently small that the changes in density are negligible. In this case the flow can be modelled as an incompressible flow. Otherwise the more general compressible flow equations must be used.

Mathematically, incompressibility is expressed by saying that the density of a fluid parcel does not change as it moves in the flow field, that is,
formula_2
where is the material derivative, which is the sum of local and convective derivatives. This additional constraint simplifies the governing equations, especially in the case when the fluid has a uniform density.

For flow of gases, to determine whether to use compressible or incompressible fluid dynamics, the Mach number of the flow is evaluated. As a rough guide, compressible effects can be ignored at Mach numbers below approximately 0.3. For liquids, whether the incompressible assumption is valid depends on the fluid properties (specifically the critical pressure and temperature of the fluid) and the flow conditions (how close to the critical pressure the actual flow pressure becomes). Acoustic problems always require allowing compressibility, since sound waves are compression waves involving changes in pressure and density of the medium through which they propagate.

===Newtonian versus non-Newtonian fluids===
All fluids, except superfluids, are viscous, meaning that they exert some resistance to deformation: neighbouring parcels of fluid moving at different velocities exert viscous forces on each other. The velocity gradient is referred to as a strain rate; it has dimensions . Isaac Newton showed that for many familiar fluids such as water and air, the stress due to these viscous forces is linearly related to the strain rate. Such fluids are called Newtonian fluids. The coefficient of proportionality is called the fluid&#x27;s viscosity; for Newtonian fluids, it is a fluid property that is independent of the strain rate.

Non-Newtonian fluids have a more complicated, non-linear stress-strain behaviour. The sub-discipline of rheology describes the stress-strain behaviours of such fluids, which include emulsions and slurries, some viscoelastic materials such as blood and some polymers, and &quot;sticky liquids&quot; such as latex, honey and lubricants.

===Inviscid versus viscous versus Stokes flow===

The dynamic of fluid parcels is described with the help of Newton&#x27;s second law. An accelerating parcel of fluid is subject to inertial effects.

The Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity which characterises the magnitude of inertial effects compared to the magnitude of viscous effects. A low Reynolds number () indicates that viscous forces are very strong compared to inertial forces. In such cases, inertial forces are sometimes neglected; this flow regime is called Stokes or creeping flow.

In contrast, high Reynolds numbers () indicate that the inertial effects have more effect on the velocity field than the viscous (friction) effects. In high Reynolds number flows, the flow is often modeled as an inviscid flow, an approximation in which viscosity is completely neglected. Eliminating viscosity allows the Navier–Stokes equations to be simplified into the Euler equations. The integration of the Euler equations along a streamline in an inviscid flow yields Bernoulli&#x27;s equation. When, in addition to being inviscid, the flow is irrotational everywhere, Bernoulli&#x27;s equation can completely describe the flow everywhere. Such flows are called potential flows, because the velocity field may be expressed as the gradient of a potential energy expression.

This idea can work fairly well when the Reynolds number is high. However, problems such as those involving solid boundaries may require that the viscosity be included. Viscosity cannot be neglected near solid boundaries because the no-slip condition generates a thin region of large strain rate, the boundary layer, in which viscosity effects dominate and which thus generates vorticity. Therefore, to calculate net forces on bodies (such as wings), viscous flow equations must be used: inviscid flow theory fails to predict drag forces, a limitation known as the d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s paradox.

A commonly used model, especially in computational fluid dynamics, is to use two flow models: the Euler equations away from the body, and boundary layer equations in a region close to the body. The two solutions can then be matched with each other, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions.

=== Steady versus unsteady flow===
A flow that is not a function of time is called steady flow. Steady-state flow refers to the condition where the fluid properties at a point in the system do not change over time. Time dependent flow is known as unsteady (also called transient). Whether a particular flow is steady or unsteady, can depend on the chosen frame of reference. For instance, laminar flow over a sphere is steady in the frame of reference that is stationary with respect to the sphere. In a frame of reference that is stationary with respect to a background flow, the flow is unsteady.

Turbulent flows are unsteady by definition. A turbulent flow can, however, be statistically stationary. The random velocity field is statistically stationary if all statistics are invariant under a shift in time. This roughly means that all statistical properties are constant in time. Often, the mean field is the object of interest, and this is constant too in a statistically stationary flow.

Steady flows are often more tractable than otherwise similar unsteady flows. The governing equations of a steady problem have one dimension fewer (time) than the governing equations of the same problem without taking advantage of the steadiness of the flow field.

===Laminar versus turbulent flow===

Turbulence is flow characterized by recirculation, eddies, and apparent randomness. Flow in which turbulence is not exhibited is called laminar. The presence of eddies or recirculation alone does not necessarily indicate turbulent flow—these phenomena may be present in laminar flow as well. Mathematically, turbulent flow is often represented via a Reynolds decomposition, in which the flow is broken down into the sum of an average component and a perturbation component.

It is believed that turbulent flows can be described well through the use of the Navier–Stokes equations. Direct numerical simulation (DNS), based on the Navier–Stokes equations, makes it possible to simulate turbulent flows at moderate Reynolds numbers. Restrictions depend on the power of the computer used and the efficiency of the solution algorithm. The results of DNS have been found to agree well with experimental data for some flows.

Most flows of interest have Reynolds numbers much too high for DNS to be a viable option, given the state of computational power for the next few decades. Any flight vehicle large enough to carry a human ( &gt; 3 m), moving faster than is well beyond the limit of DNS simulation ( = 4 million). Transport aircraft wings (such as on an Airbus A300 or Boeing 747) have Reynolds numbers of 40 million (based on the wing chord dimension). Solving these real-life flow problems requires turbulence models for the foreseeable future. Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS) combined with turbulence modelling provides a model of the effects of the turbulent flow. Such a modelling mainly provides the additional momentum transfer by the Reynolds stresses, although the turbulence also enhances the heat and mass transfer. Another promising methodology is large eddy simulation (LES), especially in the form of detached eddy simulation (DES) — a combination of LES and RANS turbulence modelling.

===Other approximations===
There are a large number of other possible approximations to fluid dynamic problems. Some of the more commonly used are listed below.
* The &quot;Boussinesq approximation&quot; neglects variations in density except to calculate buoyancy forces. It is often used in free convection problems where density changes are small.
* &quot;Lubrication theory&quot; and &quot;Hele–Shaw flow&quot; exploits the large aspect ratio of the domain to show that certain terms in the equations are small and so can be neglected.
* &quot;Slender-body theory&quot; is a methodology used in Stokes flow problems to estimate the force on, or flow field around, a long slender object in a viscous fluid.
* The &quot;shallow-water equations&quot; can be used to describe a layer of relatively inviscid fluid with a free surface, in which surface gradients are small.
* &quot;Darcy&#x27;s law&quot; is used for flow in porous media, and works with variables averaged over several pore-widths.
* In rotating systems, the &quot;quasi-geostrophic equations&quot; assume an almost perfect balance between pressure gradients and the Coriolis force. It is useful in the study of atmospheric dynamics.

== Multidisciplinary types ==

===Flows according to Mach regimes===

While many flows (such as flow of water through a pipe) occur at low Mach numbers (subsonic flows), many flows of practical interest in aerodynamics or in turbomachines occur at high fractions of (transonic flows) or in excess of it (supersonic or even hypersonic flows). New phenomena occur at these regimes such as instabilities in transonic flow, shock waves for supersonic flow, or non-equilibrium chemical behaviour due to ionization in hypersonic flows. In practice, each of those flow regimes is treated separately.

===Reactive versus non-reactive flows===
Reactive flows are flows that are chemically reactive, which finds its applications in many areas, including combustion (IC engine), propulsion devices (rockets, jet engines, and so on), detonations, fire and safety hazards, and astrophysics. In addition to conservation of mass, momentum and energy, conservation of individual species (for example, mass fraction of methane in methane combustion) need to be derived, where the production/depletion rate of any species are obtained by simultaneously solving the equations of chemical kinetics.

===Magnetohydrodynamics===

Magnetohydrodynamics is the multidisciplinary study of the flow of electrically conducting fluids in electromagnetic fields. Examples of such fluids include plasmas, liquid metals, and salt water. The fluid flow equations are solved simultaneously with Maxwell&#x27;s equations of electromagnetism.

===Relativistic fluid dynamics===
Relativistic fluid dynamics studies the macroscopic and microscopic fluid motion at large velocities comparable to the velocity of light. This branch of fluid dynamics accounts for the relativistic effects both from the special theory of relativity and the general theory of relativity. The governing equations are derived in Riemannian geometry for Minkowski spacetime.

=== Fluctuating hydrodynamics ===
This branch of fluid dynamics augments the standard hydrodynamic equations with stochastic fluxes that model 
thermal fluctuations.
As formulated by Landau and Lifshitz,
a white noise contribution obtained from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem of statistical mechanics
is added to the viscous stress tensor and heat flux.

== Terminology ==
The concept of pressure is central to the study of both fluid statics and fluid dynamics. A pressure can be identified for every point in a body of fluid, regardless of whether the fluid is in motion or not. Pressure can be measured using an aneroid, Bourdon tube, mercury column, or various other methods.

Some of the terminology that is necessary in the study of fluid dynamics is not found in other similar areas of study. In particular, some of the terminology used in fluid dynamics is not used in fluid statics.

=== Characteristic numbers ===
=== Terminology in incompressible fluid dynamics ===
The concepts of total pressure and dynamic pressure arise from Bernoulli&#x27;s equation and are significant in the study of all fluid flows. (These two pressures are not pressures in the usual sense—they cannot be measured using an aneroid, Bourdon tube or mercury column.) To avoid potential ambiguity when referring to pressure in fluid dynamics, many authors use the term static pressure to distinguish it from total pressure and dynamic pressure. Static pressure is identical to pressure and can be identified for every point in a fluid flow field.

A point in a fluid flow where the flow has come to rest (that is to say, speed is equal to zero adjacent to some solid body immersed in the fluid flow) is of special significance. It is of such importance that it is given a special name—a stagnation point. The static pressure at the stagnation point is of special significance and is given its own name—stagnation pressure. In incompressible flows, the stagnation pressure at a stagnation point is equal to the total pressure throughout the flow field.

=== Terminology in compressible fluid dynamics ===
In a compressible fluid, it is convenient to define the total conditions (also called stagnation conditions) for all thermodynamic state properties (such as total temperature, total enthalpy, total speed of sound). These total flow conditions are a function of the fluid velocity and have different values in frames of reference with different motion.

To avoid potential ambiguity when referring to the properties of the fluid associated with the state of the fluid rather than its motion, the prefix &quot;static&quot; is commonly used (such as static temperature and static enthalpy). Where there is no prefix, the fluid property is the static condition (so &quot;density&quot; and &quot;static density&quot; mean the same thing). The static conditions are independent of the frame of reference.

Because the total flow conditions are defined by isentropically bringing the fluid to rest, there is no need to distinguish between total entropy and static entropy as they are always equal by definition. As such, entropy is most commonly referred to as simply &quot;entropy&quot;.

<text>A fin is a thin component or appendage attached to a larger body or structure. Fins typically function as foils that produce lift or thrust, or provide the ability to steer or stabilize motion while traveling in water, air, or other fluids. Fins are also used to increase surface areas for heat transfer purposes, or simply as ornamentation.

Fins first evolved on fish as a means of locomotion. Fish fins are used to generate thrust and control the subsequent motion. Fish and other aquatic animals, such as cetaceans, actively propel and steer themselves with pectoral and tail fins. As they swim, they use other fins, such as dorsal and anal fins, to achieve stability and refine their maneuvering.

The fins on the tails of cetaceans, ichthyosaurs, metriorhynchids, mosasaurs and plesiosaurs are called flukes.

==Thrust generation==
Foil shaped fins generate thrust when moved, the lift of the fin sets water or air in motion and pushes the fin in the opposite direction. Aquatic animals get significant thrust by moving fins back and forth in water. Often the tail fin is used, but some aquatic animals generate thrust from pectoral fins. Fins can also generate thrust if they are rotated in air or water. Turbines and propellers (and sometimes fans and pumps) use a number of rotating fins, also called foils, wings, arms or blades. Propellers use the fins to translate torquing force to lateral thrust, thus propelling an aircraft or ship. Turbines work in reverse, using the lift of the blades to generate torque and power from moving gases or water.



Cavitation can be a problem with high power applications, resulting in damage to propellers or turbines, as well as noise and loss of power. Cavitation occurs when negative pressure causes bubbles (cavities) to form in a liquid, which then promptly and violently collapse. It can cause significant damage and wear. Cavitation damage can also occur to the tail fins of powerful swimming marine animals, such as dolphins and tuna. Cavitation is more likely to occur near the surface of the ocean, where the ambient water pressure is relatively low. Even if they have the power to swim faster, dolphins may have to restrict their speed because collapsing cavitation bubbles on their tail are too painful. Cavitation also slows tuna, but for a different reason. Unlike dolphins, these fish do not feel the bubbles, because they have bony fins without nerve endings. Nevertheless, they cannot swim faster because the cavitation bubbles create a vapor film around their fins that limits their speed. Lesions have been found on tuna that are consistent with cavitation damage.

Scombrid fishes (tuna, mackerel and bonito) are particularly high-performance swimmers. Along the margin at the rear of their bodies is a line of small rayless, non-retractable fins, known as finlets. There has been much speculation about the function of these finlets. Research done in 2000 and 2001 by Nauen and Lauder indicated that &quot;the finlets have a hydrodynamic effect on local flow during steady swimming&quot; and that &quot;the most posterior finlet is oriented to redirect flow into the developing tail vortex, which may increase thrust produced by the tail of swimming mackerel&quot;.

Fish use multiple fins, so it is possible that a given fin can have a hydrodynamic interaction with another fin. In particular, the fins immediately upstream of the caudal (tail) fin may be proximate fins that can directly affect the flow dynamics at the caudal fin. In 2011, researchers using volumetric imaging techniques were able to generate &quot;the first instantaneous three-dimensional views of wake structures as they are produced by freely swimming fishes&quot;. They found that &quot;continuous tail beats resulted in the formation of a linked chain of vortex rings&quot; and that &quot;the dorsal and anal fin wakes are rapidly entrained by the caudal fin wake, approximately within the timeframe of a subsequent tail beat&quot;.

==Motion control==
Once motion has been established, the motion itself can be controlled with the use of other fins. Boats control direction (yaw) with fin-like rudders, and roll with stabilizer and keel fins. Airplanes achieve similar results with small specialised fins that change the shape of their wings and tail fins.




Stabilising fins are used as fletching on arrows and some darts, and at the rear of some bombs, missiles, rockets and self-propelled torpedoes. These are typically planar and shaped like small wings, although grid fins are sometimes used. Static fins have also been used for one satellite, GOCE.


==Temperature regulation==
Engineering fins are also used as heat transfer fins to regulate temperature in heat sinks or fin radiators.


==Ornamentation and other uses==
In biology, fins can have an adaptive significance as sexual ornaments. During courtship, the female cichlid, &quot;Pelvicachromis taeniatus&quot;, displays a large and visually arresting purple pelvic fin. &quot;The researchers found that males clearly preferred females with a larger pelvic fin and that pelvic fins grew in a more disproportionate way than other fins on female fish.&quot;

Reshaping human feet with swim fins, rather like the tail fin of a fish, add thrust and efficiency to the kicks of a swimmer or underwater diver Surfboard fins provide surfers with means to maneuver and control their boards. Contemporary surfboards often have a centre fin and two cambered side fins.

The bodies of reef fishes are often shaped differently from open water fishes. Open water fishes are usually built for speed, streamlined like torpedoes to minimise friction as they move through the water. Reef fish operate in the relatively confined spaces and complex underwater landscapes of coral reefs. For this manoeuvrability is more important than straight line speed, so coral reef fish have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction. They outwit predators by dodging into fissures in the reef or playing hide and seek around coral heads.

The pectoral and pelvic fins of many reef fish, such as butterflyfish, damselfish and angelfish, have evolved so they can act as brakes and allow complex maneuvers. Many reef fish, such as butterflyfish, damselfish and angelfish, have evolved bodies which are deep and laterally compressed like a pancake, and will fit into fissures in rocks. Their pelvic and pectoral fins are designed differently, so they act together with the flattened body to optimise maneuverability. Some fishes, such as puffer fish, filefish and trunkfish, rely on pectoral fins for swimming and hardly use tail fins at all.



==Evolution==

There is an old theory, proposed by anatomist Carl Gegenbaur, which has been often disregarded in science textbooks, &quot;that fins and (later) limbs evolved from the gills of an extinct vertebrate&quot;. Gaps in the fossil record had not allowed a definitive conclusion. In 2009, researchers from the University of Chicago found evidence that the &quot;genetic architecture of gills, fins and limbs is the same&quot;, and that &quot;the skeleton of any appendage off the body of an animal is probably patterned by the developmental genetic program that we have traced back to formation of gills in sharks&quot;. Recent studies support the idea that gill arches and paired fins are serially homologous and thus that fins may have evolved from gill tissues.

Fish are the ancestors of all mammals, reptiles, birds and amphibians. In particular, terrestrial tetrapods (four-legged animals) evolved from fish and made their first forays onto land 400 million years ago. They used paired pectoral and pelvic fins for locomotion. The pectoral fins developed into forelegs (arms in the case of humans) and the pelvic fins developed into hind legs. Much of the genetic machinery that builds a walking limb in a tetrapod is already present in the swimming fin of a fish.


In 2011, researchers at Monash University in Australia used primitive but still living lungfish &quot;to trace the evolution of pelvic fin muscles to find out how the load-bearing hind limbs of the tetrapods evolved.&quot; Further research at the University of Chicago found bottom-walking lungfishes had already evolved characteristics of the walking gaits of terrestrial tetrapods.

In a classic example of convergent evolution, the pectoral limbs of pterosaurs, birds and bats further evolved along independent paths into flying wings. Even with flying wings there are many similarities with walking legs, and core aspects of the genetic blueprint of the pectoral fin have been retained.

About 200 million years ago the first mammals appeared. A group of these mammals started returning to the sea about 52 million years ago, thus completing a circle. These are the cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises). Recent DNA analysis suggests that cetaceans evolved from within the even-toed ungulates, and that they share a common ancestor with the hippopotamus. About 23 million years ago another group of bearlike land mammals started returning to the sea. These were the pinnipeds (seals). What had become walking limbs in cetaceans and seals evolved further, independently in a reverse form of convergent evolution, back to new forms of swimming fins. The forelimbs became flippers and, in pinnipeds, the hind limbs became a tail terminating in two fins (the cetacean fluke, conversely, is an entirely new organ). Fish tails are usually vertical and move from side to side. Cetacean flukes are horizontal and move up and down, because cetacean spines bend the same way as in other mammals.

Ichthyosaurs are ancient reptiles that resembled dolphins. They first appeared about 245 million years ago and disappeared about 90 million years ago.

&quot;This sea-going reptile with terrestrial ancestors converged so strongly on fishes that it actually evolved a dorsal fin and tail in just the right place and with just the right hydrological design. These structures are all the more remarkable because they evolved from nothing — the ancestral terrestrial reptile had no hump on its back or blade on its tail to serve as a precursor.&quot;
The biologist Stephen Jay Gould said the ichthyosaur was his favorite example of convergent evolution.
==Robotics==

The use of fins for the propulsion of aquatic animals can be remarkably effective. It has been calculated that some fish can achieve a propulsive efficiency greater than 90%. Fish can accelerate and maneuver much more effectively than boats or submarine, and produce less water disturbance and noise. This has led to biomimetic studies of underwater robots which attempt to emulate the locomotion of aquatic animals. An example is the Robot Tuna built by the Institute of Field Robotics, to analyze and mathematically model thunniform motion. In 2005, the Sea Life London Aquarium displayed three robotic fish created by the computer science department at the University of Essex. The fish were designed to be autonomous, swimming around and avoiding obstacles like real fish. Their creator claimed that he was trying to combine &quot;the speed of tuna, acceleration of a pike, and the navigating skills of an eel&quot;.

The &quot;AquaPenguin&quot;, developed by Festo of Germany, copies the streamlined shape and propulsion by front flippers of penguins. Festo also developed &quot;AquaRay&quot;, &quot;AquaJelly&quot; and &quot;AiraCuda&quot;, respectively emulating the locomotion of manta rays, jellyfish and barracuda.

In 2004, Hugh Herr at MIT prototyped a biomechatronic robotic fish with a living actuator by surgically transplanting muscles from frog legs to the robot and then making the robot swim by pulsing the muscle fibers with electricity.

Robotic fish offer some research advantages, such as the ability to examine part of a fish design in isolation from the rest, and variance of a single parameter, such as flexibility or direction. Researchers can directly measure forces more easily than in live fish. &quot;Robotic devices also facilitate three-dimensional kinematic studies and correlated hydrodynamic analyses, as the location of the locomotor surface can be known accurately. And, individual components of a natural motion (such as outstroke vs. instroke of a flapping appendage) can be programmed separately, which is certainly difficult to achieve when working with a live animal.&quot;

<text>Freyr (Old Norse: &#x27;Lord&#x27;), sometimes anglicized as Frey, is a widely attested god in Norse mythology, associated with kingship, fertility, peace, prosperity, fair weather, and good harvest. Freyr, sometimes referred to as Yngvi-Freyr, was especially associated with Sweden and seen as an ancestor of the Swedish royal house. According to Adam of Bremen, Freyr was associated with peace and pleasure, and was represented with a phallic statue in the Temple at Uppsala. According to Snorri Sturluson, Freyr was &quot;the most renowned of the æsir&quot;, and was venerated for good harvest and peace.

In the mythological stories in the Icelandic books the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Freyr is presented as one of the Vanir, the son of the god Njörðr and his sister-wife, as well as the twin brother of the goddess Freyja. The gods gave him Álfheimr, the realm of the Elves, as a teething present. He rides the shining dwarf-made boar Gullinbursti, and possesses the ship Skíðblaðnir, which always has a favorable breeze and can be folded together and carried in a pouch when it is not being used. Freyr is also known to have been associated with the horse cult. He also kept sacred horses in his sanctuary at Trondheim in Norway. He has the servants Skírnir, Byggvir and Beyla.

The most extensive surviving Freyr myth relates Freyr&#x27;s falling in love with the female jötunn Gerðr. Eventually, she becomes his wife but first Freyr has to give away his sword, which fights on its own &quot;if wise be he who wields it.&quot; Although deprived of this weapon, Freyr defeats the jötunn Beli with an antler. However, lacking his sword, Freyr will be killed by the fire jötunn Surtr during the events of Ragnarök.

Like other Germanic deities, veneration of Freyr was revived during the modern period through the Heathenry movement.

== Name ==
The Old Norse name &quot;Freyr&quot; (&#x27;lord&#x27;) is generally thought to descend from a Proto-Norse form reconstructed as , stemming from the Proto-Germanic noun &quot;*frawjaz&quot; ~ *&quot;fraw(j)ōn&quot; (&#x27;lord&#x27;), and cognate with Gothic , Old English , or Old High German , all meaning &#x27;lord, master&#x27;. The runic form , derived from an earlier , may also be related. Recently, however, an etymology deriving the name of the god from a nominalized form of the Proto-Scandinavian adjective *&quot;fraiw(i)a&quot;- (&#x27;fruitful, generative&#x27;) has also been proposed. According to linguist Guus Kroonen, &quot;within Germanic, the attestation of ON &quot;frjar&quot;, &quot;frjór&quot;, &quot;frær&quot;, Icel. &quot;frjór&quot; &#x27;fertile; prolific&#x27; &lt; *&quot;fraiwa&quot;- clearly seems to point to a stem *&quot;frai(w)&quot;- meaning &#x27;fecund&#x27;. Both in form and meaning, &quot;fraiwa&quot;- (&#x27;seed&#x27;) is reminiscent of &quot;Freyr&quot; &#x27;fertility deity&#x27; &lt; *&quot;frauja&quot;-. The possibility must be considered, therefore, that *&quot;fraiwa&quot;- was metathesized from *&quot;frawja&quot;-, a collective of some kind.&quot; Freyr is also known by a series of other names which describe his attributes and role in religious practice and associated mythology.

==Adam of Bremen==
Written 1080, one of the oldest written sources on pre-Christian Scandinavian religious practices is Adam of Bremen&#x27;s . Adam claimed to have access to first-hand accounts on pagan practices in Sweden. He refers to Freyr with the Latinized name Fricco and mentions that an image of him at Skara was destroyed by the Christian missionary Bishop Egino. Adam&#x27;s description of the Temple at Uppsala gives some details on the god.

Later in the account Adam states that when a marriage is performed a libation is made to the image of Fricco.

Historians are divided on the reliability of Adam&#x27;s account.

==&quot;Prose Edda&quot;==
When Snorri Sturluson was writing in 13th century Iceland, the indigenous Germanic gods were still remembered although they had not been openly worshiped for more than two centuries.

===&quot;Gylfaginning&quot;===
In the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; section of his &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Snorri introduces Freyr as one of the major gods.

This description has similarities to the older account by Adam of Bremen but the differences are interesting. Adam assigns control of the weather and produce of the fields to Thor but Snorri says that Freyr rules over those areas. Snorri also omits any explicitly sexual references in Freyr&#x27;s description. Those discrepancies can be explained in several ways. Adam and Snorri were writing with different goals in mind. It is possible that the Norse gods did not have exactly the same roles in Icelandic and Swedish paganism. Either Snorri or Adam may also have had distorted information.

The only extended myth related to Freyr in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; is the story of his marriage.

The woman is Gerðr, a beautiful giantess. Freyr immediately falls in love with her and becomes depressed and taciturn. After a period of brooding, he consents to talk to Skírnir, his foot-page. He tells Skírnir that he has fallen in love with a beautiful woman and thinks he will die if he cannot have her. He asks Skírnir to go and woo her for him.

The loss of Freyr&#x27;s sword has consequences. According to the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Freyr had to fight Beli without his sword, and slew him with an antler. But the result at Ragnarök, the end of the world, will be much more serious. Freyr is fated to fight the fire-giant Surtr, and since he does not have his sword he will be defeated.

Even after the loss of his weapon Freyr still has two magical artifacts, both dwarf-made. One is the ship Skíðblaðnir, which will have favoring breeze wherever its owner wants to go and can also be folded together like a napkin and carried in a pouch. The other is the boar Gullinbursti whose mane glows to illuminate the way for his owner. No myths involving Skíðblaðnir have come down to us but Snorri relates that Freyr rode to Baldr&#x27;s funeral in a wagon pulled by Gullinbursti.

===Skaldic poetry===
Freyr is referred to several times in skaldic poetry. In &quot;Húsdrápa&quot;, partially preserved in the Prose Edda, he is said to ride a boar to Baldr&#x27;s funeral.

In a poem by Egill Skalla-Grímsson, Freyr is called upon along with Njörðr to drive Eric Bloodaxe from Norway. The same skald mentions in &quot;Arinbjarnarkviða&quot; that his friend has been blessed by the two gods.

===&quot;Nafnaþulur&quot;===
In &quot;Nafnaþulur&quot; Freyr is said to ride the horse Blóðughófi (&quot;Bloody Hoof&quot;).

==&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;==

Freyr is mentioned in several of the poems in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. The information there is largely consistent with that of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; while each collection has some details not found in the other.

===&quot;Völuspá&quot;===
&quot;Völuspá&quot;, the best known of the Eddic poems, describes the final confrontation between Freyr and Surtr during Ragnarök.

Some scholars have preferred a slightly different translation, in which the sun shines &quot;from the sword of the gods&quot;. The idea is that the sword which Surtr slays Freyr with is the &quot;sword of the gods&quot; which Freyr had earlier bargained away for Gerðr. This would add a further layer of tragedy to the myth. Sigurður Nordal argued for this view but the possibility represented by Ursula Dronke&#x27;s translation above is equally possible.

===&quot;Grímnismál&quot;===
&quot;Grímnismál&quot;, a poem which largely consists of miscellaneous information about the gods, mentions Freyr&#x27;s abode.

A tooth-gift was a gift given to an infant on the cutting of the first tooth. Since &quot;Alfheimr&quot; or &quot;Álfheimr&quot; means &quot;World of Álfar (Elves)&quot; the fact that Freyr should own it is one of the indications of a connection between the Vanir and the obscure Álfar. &quot;Grímnismál&quot; also mentions that the sons of Ívaldi made Skíðblaðnir for Freyr and that it is the best of ships.

===&quot;Lokasenna&quot;===
In the poem &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, Loki accuses the gods of various misdeeds. He criticizes the Vanir for incest, saying that Njörðr had Freyr with his sister. He also states that the gods discovered Freyr and Freyja having sex together. The god Týr speaks up in Freyr&#x27;s defense.

&quot;Lokasenna&quot; also mentions that Freyr has servants called Byggvir and Beyla. They seem to have been associated with the making of bread.

===&quot;Skírnismál&quot;===

The courtship of Freyr and Gerðr is dealt with extensively in the poem &quot;Skírnismál&quot;.
Freyr is depressed after seeing Gerðr. Njörðr and Skaði ask Skírnir to go and talk with him. Freyr reveals the cause of his grief and asks Skírnir to go to Jötunheimr to woo Gerðr for him. Freyr gives Skírnir a steed and his magical sword for the journey.

When Skírnir finds Gerðr he starts by offering her treasures if she will marry Freyr. When she declines he forces her to accept by threatening her with destructive magic.
==&quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;==
Snorri Sturluson starts his epic history of the kings of Norway with &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, a euhemerized account of the Norse gods. Here Odin and the Æsir are men from Asia who gain power through their prowess in war and Odin&#x27;s skills. But when Odin attacks the Vanir he bites off more than he can chew and peace is negotiated after the destructive and indecisive Æsir-Vanir War. Hostages are exchanged to seal the peace deal and the Vanir send Freyr and Njörðr to live with the Æsir. At this point the saga, like &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, mentions that incest was practised among the Vanir.

Odin makes Njörðr and Freyr priests of sacrifices and they become influential leaders. Odin goes on to conquer the North and settles in Sweden where he rules as king, collects taxes and maintains sacrifices. After Odin&#x27;s death, Njörðr takes the throne. During his rule there is peace and good harvest and the Swedes come to believe that Njörðr controls these things. Eventually Njörðr falls ill and dies.

Freyr had a son named Fjölnir, who succeeds him as king and rules during the continuing period of peace and good seasons. Fjölnir&#x27;s descendants are enumerated in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; which describes the mythological kings of Sweden.

==&quot;Ögmundar þáttr dytts&quot;==
The 14th century Icelandic &quot;Ögmundar þáttr dytts&quot; contains a tradition of how Freyr was transported in a wagon and administered by a priestess, in Sweden. Freyr&#x27;s role as a fertility god needed a female counterpart in a divine couple (McKinnell&#x27;s translation 1987):

In this short story, a man named Gunnar was suspected of manslaughter and escaped to Sweden, where Gunnar became acquainted with this young priestess. He helped her drive Freyr&#x27;s wagon with the god effigy in it, but the god did not appreciate Gunnar and so attacked him and would have killed Gunnar if he had not promised himself to return to the Christian faith if he would make it back to Norway. When Gunnar had promised this, a demon jumped out of the god effigy and so Freyr was nothing but a piece of wood. Gunnar destroyed the wooden idol and dressed himself as Freyr, then Gunnar and the priestess travelled across Sweden where people were happy to see the god visiting them. After a while he made the priestess pregnant, but this was seen by the Swedes as confirmation that Freyr was truly a fertility god and not a scam. Finally, Gunnar had to flee back to Norway with his young bride and had her baptized at the court of Olaf Tryggvason.

==Other Icelandic sources==
Worship of Freyr is alluded to in several Icelanders&#x27; sagas.

The protagonist of &quot;Hrafnkels saga&quot; is a priest of Freyr. He dedicates a horse to the god and kills a man for riding it, setting in motion a chain of fateful events.

In &quot;Gísla saga&quot; a chieftain named &quot;Þorgrímr Freysgoði&quot; is an ardent worshipper of Freyr. When he dies he is buried in a howe.

&quot;Hallfreðar saga&quot;, &quot;Víga-Glúms saga&quot; and &quot;Vatnsdœla saga&quot; also mention Freyr.

Other Icelandic sources referring to Freyr include &quot;Íslendingabók&quot;, , and &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;.

&quot;Íslendingabók&quot;, written 1125, is the oldest Icelandic source that mentions Freyr, including him in a genealogy of Swedish kings. includes a heathen oath to be sworn at an assembly where Freyr, Njörðr, and &quot;the almighty &quot;áss&quot;&quot; are invoked. &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; mentions a Yuletide sacrifice of a boar to Freyr.

==&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;==
The 12th Century Danish &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; describes Freyr, under the name Frø, as the &quot;viceroy of the gods&quot;.

That Freyr had a cult at Uppsala is well confirmed from other sources. The reference to the change in sacrificial ritual may also reflect some historical memory. There is archaeological evidence for an increase in human sacrifices in the late Viking Age though among the Norse gods human sacrifice is most often linked to Odin. Another reference to Frø and sacrifices is found earlier in the work, where the beginning of an annual &quot;blót&quot; to him is related. King Hadingus is cursed after killing a divine being and atones for his crime with a sacrifice.

The sacrifice of dark-coloured victims to Freyr has a parallel in Ancient Greek religion where the chthonic fertility deities preferred dark-coloured victims to lighter ones.

In book 9, Saxo identifies Frø as the &quot;king of Sweden&quot; (&quot;rex Suetiae&quot;):

The reference to public prostitution may be a memory of fertility cult practices. Such a memory may also be the source of a description in book 6 of the stay of Starcatherus, a follower of Odin, in Sweden.

==Yngvi==

A strophe of the Anglo-Saxon rune poem (c. 1100) records that:

:&quot;Ing was first among the East Danes seen by men&quot;

This may refer to the origins of the worship of Ingui in the tribal areas that Tacitus mentions in his &quot;Germania&quot; as being populated by the Inguieonnic tribes. A later Danish chronicler lists Ingui was one of three brothers that the Danish tribes descended from. The strophe also states that &quot;then he (Ingui) went back over the waves, his wagon behind him&quot; which could connect Ingui to earlier conceptions of the wagon processions of Nerthus and the later Scandinavian conceptions of Freyr&#x27;s wagon journeys.

Ingui is mentioned also in some later Anglo-Saxon literature under varying forms of his name, such as &quot;For what doth Ingeld have to do with Christ&quot; and the variants used in Beowulf to designate the kings as &#x27;leader of the friends of Ing&#x27;. The compound Ingui-Frea (OE) and Yngvi-Freyr (ON) likely refer to the connection between the god and the Germanic kings&#x27; role as priests during the sacrifices in the pagan period, as &quot;Frea&quot; and &quot;Freyr&quot; are titles meaning &#x27;Lord&#x27;.

The Swedish royal dynasty was known as the Ynglings from their descent from Yngvi-Freyr. This is supported by Tacitus, who wrote about the Germans: &quot;In their ancient songs, their only way of remembering or recording the past they celebrate an earth-born god Tuisco, and his son Mannus, as the origin of their race, as their founders. To Mannus they assign three sons, from whose names, they say, the coast tribes are called Ingaevones; those of the interior, Herminones; all the rest, Istaevones&quot;.

==Archaeological record==

===Rällinge statuette===

In 1904, a Viking Age statuette identified as a depiction of Freyr was discovered on the farm Rällinge in Lunda, Södermanland parish in the province of Södermanland, Sweden. The depiction features a cross-legged seated, bearded male with an erect penis. He is wearing a pointed cap or helmet and stroking his triangular beard. The seven-centimeter-tall statue is displayed at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities.

===Skog tapestry===

A part of the Swedish Skog tapestry depicts three figures that have been interpreted as allusions to Odin, Thor, and Freyr, but also as the three Scandinavian holy kings Canute, Eric and Olaf. The figures coincide with 11th century descriptions of statue arrangements recorded by Adam of Bremen at the Temple at Uppsala and written accounts of the gods during the late Viking Age. The tapestry is originally from Hälsingland, Sweden but is now housed at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities.

===Gullgubber===

Small pieces of gold foil featuring engravings dating from the Migration Period into the early Viking Age (known as &quot;gullgubber&quot;) have been discovered in various locations in Scandinavia, at one site almost 2,500. The foil pieces have been found largely on the sites of buildings, only rarely in graves. The figures are sometimes single, occasionally an animal, sometimes a man and a woman with a leafy bough between them, facing or embracing one another. The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with their knees bent. Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson says that it has been suggested that the figures are taking part in a dance, and that they may have been connected with weddings, as well as linked to the Vanir group of gods, representing the notion of a divine marriage, such as in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Skírnismál&quot;; the coming together of Gerðr and Freyr.

==Modern influence==
Freyr appears in numerous works of modern art and literature. He appears, for example, alongside numerous other figures from Norse mythology in the Danish poet Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger&#x27;s &quot;Nordens Guder&quot; (1819). He also appears in Icelandic poet Gerður Kristný&#x27;s &quot;Blóðhófnir&quot; (2010), a feminist retelling of the Eddic poem &quot;Skírnismál&quot; that won the 2010 Icelandic Literature Award.

<text>In Norse mythology, Freyja (Old Norse &quot;(the) Lady&quot;) is a goddess associated with love, beauty, fertility, sex, war, gold, and seiðr (magic for seeing and influencing the future). Freyja is the owner of the necklace Brísingamen, rides a chariot pulled by two cats, is accompanied by the boar Hildisvíni, and possesses a cloak of falcon feathers. By her husband Óðr, she is the mother of two daughters, Hnoss and Gersemi. Along with her twin brother Freyr, her father Njörðr, and her mother (Njörðr&#x27;s sister, unnamed in sources), she is a member of the Vanir. Stemming from Old Norse &quot;Freyja&quot;, modern forms of the name include Freya, Freyia, and Freja.

Freyja rules over her heavenly field, Fólkvangr, where she receives half of those who die in battle. The other half go to the god Odin&#x27;s hall, Valhalla. Within Fólkvangr lies her hall, Sessrúmnir. Freyja assists other deities by allowing them to use her feathered cloak, is invoked in matters of fertility and love, and is frequently sought after by powerful jötnar who wish to make her their wife. Freyja&#x27;s husband, the god Óðr, is frequently absent. She cries tears of red gold for him, and searches for him under assumed names. Freyja has numerous names, including &quot;Gefn&quot;, &quot;Hörn&quot;, &quot;Mardöll&quot;, &quot;Sýr&quot;, &quot;Vanadís&quot;, and &quot;Valfreyja&quot;.

Freyja is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, composed by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century; in several Sagas of Icelanders; in the short story &quot;&quot;Sörla þáttr&quot;; in the poetry of skalds; and into the modern age in Scandinavian folklore.

Scholars have debated whether Freyja and the goddess Frigg ultimately stem from a single goddess common among the Germanic peoples. They have connected her to the valkyries, female battlefield choosers of the slain, and analyzed her relation to other goddesses and figures in Germanic mythology, including the thrice-burnt and thrice-reborn Gullveig/Heiðr, the goddesses Gefjon, Skaði, Þorgerðr Hölgabrúðr and Irpa, Menglöð, and the 1st century CE &quot;Isis&quot; of the Suebi. In Scandinavia, Freyja&#x27;s name frequently appears in the names of plants, especially in southern Sweden. Various plants in Scandinavia once bore her name, but it was replaced with the name of the Virgin Mary during the process of Christianization. Rural Scandinavians continued to acknowledge Freyja as a supernatural figure into the 19th century, and Freyja has inspired various works of art.

==Name==

=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;Freyja&quot; transparently means &#x27;lady, mistress&#x27; in Old Norse. Stemming from the Proto-Germanic feminine noun *&quot;frawjōn&quot; (&#x27;lady, mistress&#x27;), it is cognate with Old Saxon &quot;frūa&quot; (&#x27;lady, mistress&#x27;) or Old High German (&#x27;lady&#x27;; cf. modern German ). &quot;Freyja&quot; is also etymologically close to the name of the god &quot;Freyr&quot;, meaning &#x27;lord&#x27; in Old Norse. The theonym &quot;Freyja&quot; is thus considered to have been an epithet in origin, replacing a personal name that is now unattested.

=== Alternative names ===
In addition to &quot;Freyja&quot;, Old Norse sources refer to the goddess by the following names:
==Attestations==

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, Freyja is mentioned or appears in the poems &quot;Völuspá&quot;, &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, &quot;Þrymskviða&quot;, &quot;Oddrúnargrátr&quot;, and &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;.

&quot;Völuspá&quot; contains a stanza that mentions Freyja, referring to her as &quot;Óð&#x27;s girl&quot;; Freyja being the wife of her husband, Óðr. The stanza recounts that Freyja was once promised to an unnamed builder, later revealed to be a jötunn and subsequently killed by Thor (recounted in detail in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; chapter 42; see &quot;Prose Edda&quot; section below). In the poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, Odin (disguised as &quot;Grímnir&quot;) tells the young Agnar that every day Freyja allots seats to half of those that are slain in her hall Fólkvangr, while Odin owns the other half.

In the poem &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, where Loki accuses nearly every female in attendance of promiscuity or unfaithfulness, an aggressive exchange occurs between Loki and Freyja. The introduction to the poem notes that among other gods and goddesses, Freyja attends a celebration held by Ægir. In verse, after Loki has flyted with the goddess Frigg, Freyja interjects, telling Loki that he is insane for dredging up his terrible deeds, and that Frigg knows the fate of everyone, though she does not tell it. Loki tells her to be silent, and says that he knows all about her—that Freyja is not lacking in blame, for each of the gods and elves in the hall have been her lover. Freyja objects. She says that Loki is lying, that he is just looking to blather about misdeeds, and since the gods and goddesses are furious at him, he can expect to go home defeated. Loki tells Freyja to be silent, calls her a malicious witch, and conjures a scenario where Freyja was once astride her brother when all of the gods, laughing, surprised the two. Njörðr interjects—he says that a woman having a lover other than her husband is harmless, and he points out that Loki has borne children, and calls Loki a pervert. The poem continues in turn.

The poem &quot;Þrymskviða&quot; features Loki borrowing Freyja&#x27;s cloak of feathers and Thor dressing up as Freyja to fool the lusty jötunn Þrymr. In the poem, Thor wakes up to find that his powerful hammer, Mjöllnir, is missing. Thor tells Loki of his missing hammer, and the two go to the beautiful court of Freyja. Thor asks Freyja if she will lend him her cloak of feathers, so that he may try to find his hammer. Freyja agrees:


Loki flies away in the whirring feather cloak, arriving in the land of Jötunheimr. He spies Þrymr sitting on top of a mound. Þrymr reveals that he has hidden Thor&#x27;s hammer deep within the earth and that no one will ever know where the hammer is unless Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies back, the cloak whistling, and returns to the courts of the gods. Loki tells Thor of Þrymr&#x27;s conditions.

The two go to see the beautiful Freyja. The first thing that Thor says to Freyja is that she should dress herself and put on a bride&#x27;s head-dress, for they shall drive to Jötunheimr. At that, Freyja is furious—the halls of the gods shake, she snorts in anger, and from the goddess the necklace Brísingamen falls. Indignant, Freyja responds:

The gods and goddesses assemble at a thing and debate how to solve the problem. The god Heimdallr proposes to dress Thor up as a bride, complete with bridal dress, head-dress, jingling keys, jewelry, and the famous Brísingamen. Thor objects but is hushed by Loki, reminding him that the new owners of the hammer will soon be settling in the land of the gods if the hammer is not returned. Thor is dressed as planned and Loki is dressed as his maid. Thor and Loki go to Jötunheimr.

In the meantime, Thrym tells his servants to prepare for the arrival of the daughter of Njörðr. When &quot;Freyja&quot; arrives in the morning, Thrym is taken aback by her behavior; her immense appetite for food and mead is far more than what he expected, and when Thrym goes in for a kiss beneath &quot;Freyja&#x27;s&quot; veil, he finds &quot;her&quot; eyes to be terrifying, and he jumps down the hall. The disguised Loki makes excuses for the bride&#x27;s odd behavior, claiming that she simply has not eaten or slept for eight days. In the end, the disguises successfully fool the jötnar and, upon sight of it, Thor regains his hammer by force.

In the poem &quot;Oddrúnargrátr&quot;, Oddrún helps Borgny give birth to twins. In thanks, Borgny invokes vættir, Frigg, Freyja, and other unspecified deities.


Freyja is a main character in the poem &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;, where she assists her faithful servant Óttar in finding information about his ancestry so that he may claim his inheritance. In doing so, Freyja turns Óttar into her boar, Hildisvíni, and, by means of flattery and threats of death by fire, Freyja successfully pries the information that Óttar needs from the jötunn Hyndla. Freyja speaks throughout the poem, and at one point praises Óttar for constructing a hörgr (an altar of stones) and frequently making blót (sacrifices) to her:


===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
Freyja appears in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; books &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;. In chapter 24 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, the enthroned figure of High says that after the god Njörðr split with the goddess Skaði, he had two beautiful and mighty children (no partner is mentioned); a son, Freyr, and a daughter, Freyja. Freyr is &quot;the most glorious&quot; of the gods, and Freyja &quot;the most glorious&quot; of the goddesses. Freyja has a dwelling in the heavens, Fólkvangr, and that whenever Freyja &quot;rides into battle she gets half the slain, and the other half to Odin [...]&quot;. In support, High quotes the &quot;Grímnismál&quot; stanza mentioned in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; section above.

High adds that Freyja has a large, beautiful hall called Sessrúmnir, and that when Freyja travels she sits in a chariot and drives two cats, and that Freyja is &quot;the most approachable one for people to pray to, and from her name is derived the honorific title whereby noble ladies are called &quot;fruvor&quot; [noble ladies]&quot;. High adds that Freyja has a particular fondness for love songs, and that &quot;it is good to pray to her concerning love affairs&quot;.

In chapter 29, High recounts the names and features of various goddesses, including Freyja. Regarding Freyja, High says that, next to Frigg, Freyja is highest in rank among them and that she owns the necklace Brísingamen. Freyja is married to Óðr, who goes on long travels, and the two have a very fair daughter by the name of Hnoss. While Óðr is absent, Freyja stays behind and in her sorrow she weeps tears of red gold. High notes that Freyja has many names, and explains that this is because Freyja adopted them when looking for Óðr and traveling &quot;among strange peoples&quot;. These names include &quot;Gefn&quot;, &quot;Hörn&quot;, &quot;Mardöll&quot;, &quot;Sýr&quot;, and &quot;Vanadís&quot;.

Freyja plays a part in the events leading to the birth of Sleipnir, the eight-legged horse. In chapter 42, High recounts that, soon after the gods built the hall Valhalla, a builder (unnamed) came to them and offered to build for them in three seasons a fortification so solid that no jötunn would be able to come in over from Midgard. In exchange, the builder wants Freyja for his bride, and the sun and the moon. After some debate the gods agree, but with added conditions. In time, just as he is about to complete his work, it is revealed that the builder is, in fact, himself a jötunn, and he is killed by Thor. In the meantime, Loki, in the form of a mare, has been impregnated by the jötunn&#x27;s horse, Svaðilfari, and so gives birth to Sleipnir. In support, High quotes the &quot;Völuspá&quot; stanza that mentions Freyja. In chapter 49, High recalls the funeral of Baldr and says that Freyja attended the funeral and there drove her cat-chariot, the final reference to the goddess in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;.

At the beginning of the book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Freyja is mentioned among eight goddesses attending a banquet held for Ægir. Chapter 56 details the abduction of the goddess Iðunn by the jötunn Þjazi in the form of an eagle. Terrified at the prospect of death and torture due to his involvement in the abduction of Iðunn, Loki asks if he may use Freyja&#x27;s &quot;falcon shape&quot; to fly north to Jötunheimr and retrieve the missing goddess. Freyja allows it, and using her &quot;falcon shape&quot; and a furious chase by eagle-Þjazi, Loki successfully returns her.

In chapter 6, a means of referring to Njörðr is provided that refers to Frejya (&quot;father of Freyr and Freyja&quot;). In chapter 7, a means of referring to Freyr is provided that refers to the goddess (&quot;brother of Freyja&quot;). In chapter 8, ways of referring to the god Heimdallr are provided, including &quot;Loki&#x27;s enemy, recoverer of Freyja&#x27;s necklace&quot;, inferring a myth involving Heimdallr recovering Freyja&#x27;s necklace from Loki.

In chapter 17, the jötunn Hrungnir finds himself in Asgard, the realm of the gods, and becomes very drunk. Hrungnir boasts that he will move Valhalla to Jötunheimr, bury Asgard, and kill all of the gods—with the exception of the goddesses Freyja and Sif, who he says he will take home with him. Freyja is the only one of them that dares to bring him more to drink. Hrungnir says that he will drink all of their ale. After a while, the gods grow bored of Hrungnir&#x27;s antics and invoke the name of Thor. Thor immediately enters the hall, hammer raised. Thor is furious and demands to know who is responsible for letting a jötunn in to Asgard, who guaranteed Hrungnir safety, and why Freyja &quot;should be serving him drink as if at the Æsir&#x27;s banquet&quot;.

In chapter 18, verses from the 10th century skald&#x27;s composition &quot;Þórsdrápa&quot; are quoted. A kenning used in the poem refers to Freyja. In chapter 20, poetic ways to refer to Freyja are provided; &quot;daughter of Njörðr&quot;, &quot;sister of Freyr&quot;, &quot;wife of Óðr&quot;, &quot;mother of Hnoss&quot;, &quot;possessor of the fallen slain and of Sessrumnir and tom-cats&quot;, possessor of Brísingamen, &quot;Van-deity&quot;, Vanadís, and &quot;fair-tear deity&quot;. In chapter 32, poetic ways to refer to gold are provided, including &quot;Freyja&#x27;s weeping&quot; and &quot;rain or shower [...] from Freyja&#x27;s eyes&quot;.

Chapter 33 tells that once the gods journeyed to visit Ægir, one of whom was Freyja. In chapter 49, a quote from a work by the skald Einarr Skúlason employs the kenning &quot;Óðr&#x27;s bedfellow&#x27;s eye-rain&quot;, which refers to Freyja and means &quot;gold&quot;.

Chapter 36 explains again that gold can be referring to as Freyja&#x27;s weeping due to her red gold tears. In support, works by the skalds Skúli Þórsteinsson and Einarr Skúlason are cited that use &quot;Freyja&#x27;s tears&quot; or &quot;Freyja&#x27;s weepings&quot; to represent &quot;gold&quot;. The chapter features additional quotes from poetry by Einarr Skúlason that references the goddess and her child Hnoss. Freyja receives a final mention in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; in chapter 75, where a list of goddesses is provided that includes Freyja.

===&quot;Heimskringla&quot;===

The &quot;Heimskringla&quot; book &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; provides a euhemerized account of the origin of the gods, including Freyja. In chapter 4, Freyja is introduced as a member of the Vanir, the sister of Freyr, and the daughter of Njörðr and his sister (whose name is not provided). After the Æsir–Vanir War ends in a stalemate, Odin appoints Freyr and Njörðr as priests over sacrifices. Freyja becomes the priestess of sacrificial offerings and it was she who introduced the practice of seiðr to the Æsir, previously only practiced by the Vanir.

In chapter 10, Freyja&#x27;s brother Freyr dies, and Freyja is the last survivor among the Æsir and Vanir. Freyja keeps up the sacrifices and becomes famous. The saga explains that, due to Freyja&#x27;s fame, all women of rank become known by her name—&quot;frúvor&quot; (&quot;ladies&quot;), a woman who is the mistress of her property is referred to as &quot;freyja&quot;, and &quot;húsfreyja&quot; (&quot;lady of the house&quot;) for a woman who owns an estate.

The chapter adds that not only was Freyja very clever, but that she and her husband Óðr had two immensely beautiful daughters, Gersemi and Hnoss, &quot;who gave their names to our most precious possessions&quot;.

===Other===
Freyja is mentioned in the sagas &quot;Egils saga&quot;, &quot;Njáls saga&quot;, &quot;Hálfs saga ok Hálfsrekka&quot;, and in &quot;Sörla þáttr&quot;.

;&quot;Egils saga&quot;
In &quot;Egils saga&quot;, when Egill Skallagrímsson refuses to eat, his daughter Þorgerðr (here anglicized as &quot;Thorgerd&quot;) says she will go without food and thus starve to death, and in doing so will meet the goddess Freyja:

Thorgerd replied in a loud voice, &quot;I have had no evening meal, nor will I do so until I join Freyja. I know no better course of action than my father&#x27;s. I do not want to live after my father and brother are dead.&quot;
;&quot;Hálfs saga ok Hálfsrekka&quot;
In the first chapter of the 14th century legendary saga &quot;Hálfs saga ok Hálfsrekka&quot;, King Alrek has two wives, Geirhild and Signy, and cannot keep them both. He tells the two women that he would keep whichever of them that brews the better ale for him by the time he has returned home in the summer. The two compete and during the brewing process Signy prays to Freyja and Geirhild to Hött (&quot;hood&quot;), a man she had met earlier (earlier in the saga revealed to be Odin in disguise). Hött answers her prayer and spits on her yeast. Signy&#x27;s brew wins the contest.

;&quot;Sörla þáttr&quot;
In &quot;Sörla þáttr&quot;, a short, late 14th century narrative from a later and extended version of the &quot;Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar&quot; found in the &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot; manuscript, a euhemerized account of the gods is provided. In the account, Freyja is described as having been a concubine of Odin, who bartered sex to four dwarfs for a golden necklace. In the work, the Æsir once lived in a city called Asgard, located in a region called &quot;Asialand or Asiahome&quot;. Odin was the king of the realm, and made Njörðr and Freyr temple priests. Freyja was the daughter of Njörðr, and was Odin&#x27;s concubine. Odin deeply loved Freyja, and she was &quot;the fairest of woman of that day&quot;. Freyja had a beautiful bower, and when the door was shut no one could enter without Freyja&#x27;s permission.

Chapter 1 records that one day Freyja passed by an open stone where dwarfs lived. Four dwarfs were smithying a golden necklace, and it was nearly done. Looking at the necklace, the dwarfs thought Freyja to be most fair, and she the necklace. Freyja offered to buy the collar from them with silver and gold and other items of value. The dwarfs said that they had no lack of money, and that for the necklace the only thing she could offer them would be a night with each of them. &quot;Whether she liked it better or worse&quot;, Freyja agreed to the conditions, and so spent a night with each of the four dwarfs. The conditions were fulfilled and the necklace was hers. Freyja went home to her bower as if nothing happened.

As related in chapter 2, Loki, under the service of Odin, found out about Freyja&#x27;s actions and told Odin. Odin told Loki to get the necklace and bring it to him. Loki said that since no one could enter Freyja&#x27;s bower against her will, this would not be an easy task, yet Odin told him not to come back until he had found a way to get the necklace. Howling, Loki turned away and went to Freyja&#x27;s bower but found it locked, and that he could not enter. So Loki transformed himself into a fly, and after having trouble finding even the tiniest of entrances, he managed to find a tiny hole at the gable-top, yet even here he had to squeeze through to enter.

Having made his way into Freyja&#x27;s chambers, Loki looked around to be sure that no one was awake, and found that Freyja was asleep. He landed on her bed and noticed that she was wearing the necklace, the clasp turned downward. Loki turned into a flea and jumped onto Freyja&#x27;s cheek and there bit her. Freyja stirred, turning about, and then fell asleep again. Loki removed his flea&#x27;s shape and undid her collar, opened the bower, and returned to Odin.

The next morning Freyja woke and saw that the doors to her bower were open, yet unbroken, and that her precious necklace was gone. Freyja had an idea of who was responsible. She got dressed and went to Odin. She told Odin of the malice he had allowed against her and of the theft of her necklace, and that he should give her back her jewelry.

Odin said that, given how she obtained it, she would never get it back. That is, with one exception: she could have it back if she could make two kings, themselves ruling twenty kings each, battle one another, and cast a spell so that each time one of their numbers falls in battle, they will again spring up and fight again. And that this must go on eternally, unless a Christian man of a particular stature goes into the battle and smites them, only then will they stay dead. Freyja agreed.

==Later Scandinavian folklore==
Although the Christianization of Scandinavia sought to demonize the native gods, belief and reverence in the gods, including Freyja, persisted throughout the modern period and melded into Scandinavian folklore. comments that Freyja became a particular target under Christianization:

Freyja&#x27;s erotic qualities became an easy target for the new religion, in which an asexual virgin was the ideal woman [...] Freyja is called &quot;a whore&quot; and &quot;a harlot&quot; by the holy men and missionaries, whereas many of her functions in the everyday lives of men and women, such as protecting the vegetation and supplying assistance in childbirth were transferred to the Virgin Mary.
However, Freyja did not disappear. In Iceland, Freyja was called upon for assistance by way of Icelandic magical staves as late as the 18th century; and as late as the 19th century, Freyja is recorded as retaining elements of her role as a fertility goddess among rural Swedes.

The Old Norse poem &quot;Þrymskviða&quot; (or its source) continued into Scandinavian folk song tradition, where it was euhemerized and otherwise transformed over time. In Iceland, the poem became known as &quot;Þrylur&quot;, whereas in Denmark the poem became &quot;Thor af Havsgaard&quot; and in Sweden it became &quot;Torvisan&quot; or &quot;Hammarhämtningen&quot;. A section of the Swedish &quot;Torvisan&quot;, in which &quot;Freyja&quot; has been transformed into &quot;the fair&quot; (&quot;den väna&quot;) &quot;Frojenborg&quot;, reads as follows:


In the province of Småland, Sweden, an account is recorded connecting Freyja with sheet lightning in this respect. Writer Johan Alfred Göth recalled a Sunday in 1880 where men were walking in fields and looking at nearly ripened rye, where Måns in Karryd said: &quot;Now Freyja is out watching if the rye is ripe&quot;. Along with this, Göth recalls another mention of Freyja in the countryside:

When as a boy I was visiting the old Proud-Katrina, I was afraid of lightning like all boys in those days. When the sheet lightning flared at the night, Katrina said: &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid little child, it is only Freyja who is out making fire with steel and flintstone to see if the rye is ripe. She is kind to people and she is only doing it to be of service, she is not like Thor, he slays both people and livestock, when he is in the mood&quot; [...] I later heard several old folks talk of the same thing in the same way.
In Värend, Sweden, Freyja could also arrive at Christmas night and she used to shake the apple trees for the sake of a good harvest and consequently people left some apples in the trees for her sake. However, it was dangerous to leave the plough outdoors, because if Freyja sat on it, it would no longer be of any use.

Many Asatru practitioners today mostly honor Freyja as a goddess of fertility, abundance and beauty. A common rite for modern Freya worshippers is to bake foods that have some connection to love in one way or another, such as chocolate. Freyja is also called upon for protection, usually when it comes to a domestic violence situation.

==Eponyms==
Several plants were named after Freyja, such as &quot;Freyja&#x27;s tears&quot; and &quot;Freyja&#x27;s hair&quot; (&quot;Polygala vulgaris&quot;), but during the process of Christianization, the name of the goddess was replaced with that of the Virgin Mary. In the pre-Christian period, the Orion constellation was called either Frigg&#x27;s distaff or Freyja&#x27;s distaff (Swedish &quot;Frejerock&quot;).

Place names in Norway and Sweden reflect devotion to the goddess, including the Norwegian place name Frøihov (originally *&quot;Freyjuhof&quot;, literally &quot;Freyja&#x27;s hof&quot;) and Swedish place names such as Frövi (from *&quot;Freyjuvé&quot;, literally &quot;Freyja&#x27;s vé&quot;). In a survey of toponyms in Norway, M. Olsen tallies at least 20 to 30 location names compounded with &quot;Freyja&quot;. Three of these place names appear to derive from *&quot;Freyjuhof&quot; (&#x27;Freyja&#x27;s hof&#x27;), whereas the goddess&#x27;s name is frequently otherwise compounded with words for &#x27;meadow&#x27; (such as &quot;-þveit&quot;, -&quot;land&quot;) and similar land formations. These toponyms are attested most commonly on the west coast though a high frequency is found in the southeast.

Place names containing &quot;Freyja&quot; are yet more numerous and varied in Sweden, where they are widely distributed. A particular concentration is recorded in Uppland, among which a number derive from the above-mentioned &quot;*Freyjuvé&quot; and also *&quot;Freyjulundr&quot; (&#x27;Freyja&#x27;s sacred grove&#x27;), place names that indicate public worship of Freyja. A variety of place names (such as &quot;Frøal&quot; and &quot;Fröale&quot;) have been seen as containing an element cognate to Gothic &quot;alhs&quot; and Old English &quot;ealh&quot; (&quot;temple&quot;), although these place names may be otherwise interpreted. In addition, &quot;Frejya&quot; appears as a compound element with a variety of words for geographic features such as fields, meadows, lakes and natural objects such as rocks.

The Freyja name &quot;Hörn&quot; appears in the Swedish place names Härnevi and Järnevi, stemming from the reconstructed Old Norse place name &quot;*Hörnar-vé&quot; (meaning &quot;Hörn&#x27;s vé&quot;).

==Archaeological record and historic depictions==

A priestess was buried with considerable splendour in Hagebyhöga in Östergötland. In addition to being buried with her wand, she had received great riches which included horses, a wagon and an Arabian bronze pitcher. There was also a silver pendant, which represents a woman with a broad necklace around her neck. This kind of necklace was only worn by the most prominent women during the Iron Age and some have interpreted it as Freyja&#x27;s necklace Brísingamen. The pendant may represent Freyja herself.

A 7th-century phalara found in a &quot;warrior grave&quot; in what is now Eschwege in northwestern Germany features a female figure with two large braids flanked by two &quot;cat-like&quot; beings and holding a staff-like object. This figure has been interpreted as Freyja. This image may be connected to various B-type bracteates, referred to as the Fürstenberg-type, that may also depict the goddess; they &quot;show a female figure, in a short skirt and double-looped hair, holding a stave or sceptre in her right hand and a double-cross feature in the left&quot;.

Upon its discovery, the 10th century Oseberg ship burial was found to contain a ceremonial wagon. One side of the ornate wagon features a depiction of nine cats. Scholars have linked this depiction to Freyja&#x27;s cat-led chariot and a broader associations between the Vanir and wagons.

A 12th century depiction of a cloaked but otherwise nude woman riding a large cat appears on a wall in the Schleswig Cathedral in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany. Beside her is similarly a cloaked yet otherwise nude woman riding a distaff. Due to iconographic similarities to the literary record, these figures have been theorized as depictions of Freyja and Frigg respectively.

==Theories==

===Relation to Frigg and other goddesses and figures===
Due to numerous similarities, scholars have frequently connected Freyja with the goddess Frigg. The connection with Frigg and question of possible earlier identification of Freyja with Frigg in the Proto-Germanic period (Frigg and Freyja common origin hypothesis) remains a matter of scholarly discourse. Regarding a Freyja-Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar Stephan Grundy comments, &quot;the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-Viking Age references to Germanic goddesses, and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported.&quot;

Like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the Vanir, the name &quot;Freyja&quot; is not attested outside of Scandinavia, as opposed to the name of the goddess &quot;Frigg&quot;, who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as Proto-Germanic *&quot;Frijjō&quot;. Similar proof for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which &quot;Freyja&quot; descends does not exist, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to lack of evidence.

In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, a figure by the name of Gullveig is burnt three times yet is three times reborn. After her third rebirth, she is known as Heiðr. This event is generally accepted as precipitating the Æsir–Vanir War. Starting with scholar Gabriel Turville-Petre, scholars such as Rudolf Simek, Andy Orchard, and John Lindow have theorized that Gullveig/Heiðr is the same figure as Freyja, and that her involvement with the Æsir somehow led to the events of the Æsir–Vanir War.

Outside of theories connecting Freyja with the goddess Frigg, some scholars, such as Hilda Ellis Davidson and , have theorized that other goddesses in Norse mythology, such as Gefjon, Gerðr, and Skaði, may be forms of Freyja in different roles or ages.

===Receiver of the slain===
Freyja and her afterlife field Fólkvangr, where she receives half of the slain, have been theorized as connected to the valkyries. Scholar Britt-Mari Näsström points out the description in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; where it is said of Freyja that &quot;whenever she rides into battle she takes half of the slain&quot;, and interprets &quot;Fólkvangr&quot; as &quot;the field of the Warriors&quot;. Näsström notes that, just like Odin, Freyja receives slain heroes who have died on the battlefield, and that her house is Sessrumnir (which she translates as &quot;filled with many seats&quot;), a dwelling that Näsström posits likely fills the same function as Valhalla. Näsström comments that &quot;still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse view of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn and the other to Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally &#x27;the one who chooses the slain&#x27;.&quot;

Siegfried Andres Dobat comments that &quot;in her mythological role as the chooser of half the fallen warriors for her death realm Fólkvangr, the goddess Freyja, however, emerges as the mythological role model for the Valkyrjar and the dísir.&quot;

===The Oriental hypothesis===
Gustav Neckel, writing in 1920, connects Freyja to the Phrygian goddess Cybele. According to Neckel, both goddesses can be interpreted as &quot;fertility goddesses&quot; and other potential resemblances have been noted. Some scholars have suggested that the image of Cybele subsequently influenced the iconography of Freyja, the lions drawing the former&#x27;s chariot becoming large cats. These observations became an extremely common observation in works regarding Old Norse religion until at least the early 1990s. In her book-length study of scholarship on the topic of Freyja, Britt-Mari Näsström (1995) is highly critical of this deduction; Näsström says that &quot;these &#x27;parallels&#x27; are due to sheer ignorance about the characteristics of Cybele; scholars have not troubled to look into the resemblances and differences between the two goddesses, if any, in support for their arguments for a common origin.&quot;

==In art and literature==
Into the modern period, Freyja was treated as a Scandinavian counterpart to the Roman Venus in, for example, Swedish literature, where the goddess may be associated with romantic love or, conversely, simply as a synonym for &quot;lust and potency&quot;. In the 18th century, Swedish poet Carl Michael Bellman referred to Stockholm prostitutes in his &quot;Fredman&#x27;s Epistles&quot; as &quot;the children of Fröja&quot;. In the 19th century, Britt-Mari Näsström observes, Swedish Romanticism focused less on Freyja&#x27;s erotic qualities and more on the image of &quot;the pining goddess, weeping for her husband&quot;.

Freyja is mentioned in the first stanza (&quot;it is called old Denmark and it is Freja&#x27;s hall&quot;) of the civil national anthem of Denmark, &quot;Der er et yndigt land&quot;, written by 19th century Danish poet Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger in 1819. In addition, Oehlenschläger wrote a comedy entitled &quot;Freyjas alter&quot; (1818) and a poem &quot;Freais sal&quot; featuring the goddess.

The 19th century German composer Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; opera cycle features &quot;Freia&quot;, the goddess Freyja combined with the apple-bearing goddess Iðunn.

In late 19th century and early 20th century Northern Europe, Freyja was the subject of numerous works of art, including &quot;Freyja&quot; by H. E. Freund (statue, 1821–1822), &quot;Freja sökande sin make&quot; (painting, 1852) by Nils Blommér, &quot;Freyjas Aufnahme uner den Göttern&quot; (charcoal drawing, 1881), and &quot;Frigg; Freyja&quot; (drawing, 1883) by , &quot;Freyja&quot; (1901) by Carl Emil Doepler d. J., and &quot;Freyja and the Brisingamen&quot; by J. Doyle Penrose (painting, 1862–1932). Like other Norse goddesses, her name was applied widely in Scandinavia to, for example, &quot;sweetmeats or to stout carthorses&quot;.

&quot;Vanadís&quot;, one of Freyja&#x27;s names, is the source of the name of the chemical element vanadium, so named because of its many colored compounds.

==In popular culture==
Frigga (sometimes called Freyja) is a fictional character appearing in Marvel Comics starting in 1963. The character in particular is based on goddess Freyja of the Norse mythology.

Starting in the early 1990s, derivatives of &quot;Freyja&quot; began to appear as a given name for girls. According to the Norwegian name database from the Central Statistics Bureau, around 500 women are listed with the first name &quot;Frøya&quot; (the modern Norwegian spelling of the goddess&#x27;s name) in the country. There are also several similar names, such as the first element of the dithematic personal name &quot;Frøydis&quot;.

Freyja is featured in several video games including the 2002 Ensemble Studios game &quot;Age of Mythology&quot;, the 2014 third-person multiplayer online battle arena game &quot;Smite&quot;, the 2018 Santa Monica Studio game God of War, and in its 2022 sequel &quot;God of War Ragnarök&quot;.

&quot;Freya&quot; is a song by American heavy metal band The Sword from their 2006 debut album &quot;Age of Winters&quot;. A playable cover version was featured in &quot;Guitar Hero II&quot;, released the same year.

<text>First-class cricket, along with List A cricket and Twenty20 cricket, is one of the highest-standard forms of cricket. A first-class match is one of three or more days&#x27; scheduled duration between two sides of eleven players each and is officially adjudged to be worthy of the status by virtue of the standard of the competing teams. Matches must allow for the teams to play two innings each, although in practice a team might play only one innings or none at all.

The etymology of &quot;first-class cricket&quot; is unknown, but the term was used loosely before it acquired official status in 1895, following a meeting of leading English clubs. At a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC) in 1947, it was formally defined on a global basis. A significant omission of the ICC ruling was any attempt to define first-class cricket retrospectively. That has left historians, and especially statisticians, with the problem of how to categorise earlier matches, especially those played in Great Britain before 1895. The Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (ACS) has published a list of early matches which are believed to have been of a high standard.

Test cricket, the highest standard of cricket, is statistically a form of first-class cricket, though the term &quot;first-class&quot; is mainly used to refer to domestic competition. A player&#x27;s first-class statistics include any performances in Test matches.

==Initial usage under MCC ruling, May 1894==
Before 1894 &quot;first-class&quot; was a common adjective applied to cricket matches in England, used loosely to suggest that a match had a high standard; adjectives like &quot;great&quot;, &quot;important&quot; and &quot;major&quot; were also loosely applied to such matches, but there tended to be differences of opinion. In the inaugural issue of &quot;&quot; on 10 May 1882, the term is used twice on page 2 in reference to the recently completed tour of Australia and New Zealand by Alfred Shaw&#x27;s XI. The report says it is &quot;taking&quot; the first-class matches to be one against Sydney (&quot;sic&quot;), two each against Victoria, the Combined team and the Australian Eleven, and another against South Australia. In the fourth issue on 1 June 1882, James Lillywhite refers to first-class matches on the tour but gives a different list.

The earliest known match scorecards date from 1744 but few have been found before 1772. The cards for three 1772 matches have survived and scorecards became increasingly common thereafter. At the beginning of the 1860s, there were only four formally constituted county clubs. Sussex was the oldest, formed in 1839, and it had been followed by Kent, Nottinghamshire and Surrey. In the early 1860s, several more county clubs were founded, and questions began to be raised in the sporting press about which should be categorised as first-class, but there was considerable disagreement in the answers. In 1880, the Cricket Reporting Agency was founded. It acquired influence through the decade especially by association with &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; (&quot;Wisden&quot;) and the press came to generally rely on its information and opinions.

The term acquired official status, though limited to matches in Great Britain, following a meeting at Lord&#x27;s in May 1894 between the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) committee and the secretaries of the clubs involved in the official County Championship, which had begun in 1890. As a result, those clubs became first-class from 1895 along with MCC, Cambridge University, Oxford University, senior cricket touring teams (i.e., Australia and South Africa at that time) and other teams designated as such by MCC (e.g., North v South, Gentlemen v Players and occasional &quot;elevens&quot; which consisted of recognised first-class players). Officially, therefore, the inaugural first-class match was the opening game of the 1895 season between MCC and Nottinghamshire at Lord&#x27;s on 1 and 2 May, MCC winning by 37 runs.

&quot;Test match&quot; was another loosely applied term at the time but the first list of matches considered to be &quot;Tests&quot; was conceived and published by South Australian journalist Clarence P. Moody in his 1894 book, &quot;Australian Cricket and Cricketers, 1856 to 1893–94&quot;. His proposal was widely accepted after a list of 39 matches was reproduced in the 28 December 1894 issue of &quot;Cricket&quot; magazine. The list began with the Melbourne Cricket Ground match played 15–17 March 1877 and ended with a recent match at the Association Ground, Sydney played 14–20 December 1894. All of Moody&#x27;s matches, plus four additional ones, were retrospectively recognised as Test matches and also, thereby, as first-class matches.

==Formal definition under ICC ruling, May 1947==
The term &quot;first-class cricket&quot; was formally defined by the then Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC) on 19 May 1947. It was made clear that the definition &quot;will not have retrospective effect&quot;. The definition is as follows:

A match of three or more days&#x27; duration between two sides of eleven players officially adjudged first-class, shall be regarded as a first-class fixture. Matches in which either team have more than eleven players or which are scheduled for less than three days shall not be regarded as first-class. The Governing body in each country shall decide the status of teams.

For example, MCC was authorised to determine the status of matches played in Great Britain. To all intents and purposes, the 1947 ICC definition confirmed the 1894 MCC definition, and gave it international recognition and usage.

Hence, official judgment of status is the responsibility of the governing body in each country that is a &quot;full member&quot; of the International Cricket Council (ICC). The governing body grants first-class status to international teams and to domestic teams that are representative of the country&#x27;s highest playing standard. Later ICC rulings make it possible for international teams from &quot;associate members&quot; of the ICC to achieve first-class status but it is dependent on the status of their opponents in a given match.

===Definition===
According to the ICC definition, a match may be adjudged first-class if:
* it is of three or more days scheduled duration
* each side playing the match has eleven players
* each side may have two innings
* the match is played on natural, and not artificial, turf
* the match is played at a venue which meets certain standard criteria regarding venues
* the match conforms to the Laws of Cricket, except for only minor amendments 
* the sport&#x27;s governing body in the appropriate nation, or the ICC itself, recognises the match as first-class.

A Test match is a first-class match played between two ICC full member countries, subject to their current status at the ICC and the application of ICC conditions when the match is played.

===Recognised matches===
In 2010, the ICC published its &quot;Classification of Official Cricket&quot; which includes the criteria with which a match must comply to achieve a desired categorisation. In the section on first-class cricket, there is a list of the types of match that &quot;should&quot; qualify. It is important to note, given the differences in opinion about what constitutes a first-class match, that the ICC clearly stipulates that its match type list &quot;is not exhaustive and is merely indicative of the matches which would fall into the first-class definition&quot;. For example, the list includes matches of recognised first-class teams &quot;versus&quot; international touring teams; and the leading domestic championships (using their then-current names) such as the County Championship, Sheffield Shield, Ranji Trophy, etc.

==First-class domestic competitions==

===Current active men&#x27;s competitions===
==Retrospective classification of matches played before the definitions==
The absence of any ICC ruling about matches played before 1947 (or before 1895 in Great Britain) is problematic for those cricket statisticians who wish to categorise earlier matches in the same way. They have responded by compiling their own match lists and allocating a strictly &quot;unofficial&quot; first-class status to the matches they consider to have been of a high standard. It is therefore a matter of opinion only with no official support. Inevitable differences have arisen and there are variations in published cricket statistics. In November 2021, the ICC retrospectively applied first-class status to women&#x27;s cricket, aligning it with the men&#x27;s game.

===Issue for statisticians===
A key issue for the statisticians is when first-class cricket for their purpose is deemed to have begun. Writing in 1951, Roy Webber argued that the majority of matches prior to 1864 (i.e., the year in which overarm bowling was legalised) &quot;cannot be regarded as first-class&quot; and their records are used &quot;for their historical associations&quot;. This drew a line between what was important historically and what should form part of the statistical record. Hence, for pre-1895 (i.e., in Great Britain) cricket matches, &quot;first-class&quot; is essentially a statistical concept while the historical concept is broader and takes account of historical significance. Webber&#x27;s rationale was that cricket was &quot;generally weak before 1864&quot; (there was a greater and increasingly more organised effort to promote county cricket from about that time) and match details were largely incomplete, especially bowling analyses, which hindered compilation of records. According to Webber&#x27;s view, the inaugural first-class match was the opening game of the 1864 season between Cambridge University and MCC at Fenner&#x27;s on 12 and 13 May, Cambridge winning by 6 wickets.

===Important matches list===
When the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (ACS) published its &quot;Guide to First-Class Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles&quot; in 1982, it tentatively agreed with Webber&#x27;s 1864 start date by saying that &quot;the line between first-class and other matches becomes more easily discernible about that date&quot;. A year earlier, the ACS had published its &quot;Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles, 1709–1863&quot; in which it listed all the known matches during that period which it considered to have historical importance. The ACS did stipulate that they had taken a more lenient view of importance regarding matches played in the 18th century than they did of matches played in the 19th century. As they explained, surviving details of 18th century matches are typically incomplete while there is a fairly comprehensive store of data about 19th century matches, certainly since 1825.

===Earlier startpoints suggested===
Subsequently, Webber&#x27;s view was challenged by Bill Frindall who believed that 1815 should be the startpoint to encompass the entire roundarm bowling phase of cricket&#x27;s history, although roundarm did not begin in earnest until 1827. In Frindall&#x27;s view, the inaugural first-class match should have been the opening game of the 1815 season between MCC and Middlesex at Lord&#x27;s on 31 May and 1 June, Middlesex winning by 16 runs. Notwithstanding Frindall&#x27;s reputation, Webber&#x27;s view has been revived and reinforced in recent times. For example, the Kent researcher Derek Carlaw began his study of Kent cricketers since 1806 by stating: &quot;Part One is confined to players who appeared for Kent in important matches from 1806 to 1863 and first-class matches from 1864 to 1914&quot;.

On the internet, the &quot;CricketArchive&quot; (CA) and &quot;ESPN Cricinfo&quot; (CI) databases both say the earliest first-class match was Hampshire v England at Broadhalfpenny Down on 24 and 25 June 1772. At that time, cricket matches were played with a two-stump wicket and exclusively underarm bowling, although other features of the modern game had been introduced. The opinion of these databases has been repudiated by both &quot;Wisden&quot; and &quot;Playfair Cricket Annual&quot;. &quot;Wisden&quot; agrees with Frindall by commencing its first-class records in 1815. &quot;Playfair&quot; supports Webber and begins its records in 1864.

The status of earlier matches, including many in the ACS&#x27; &quot;Important Matches&quot; guide, which have left no scorecard and for which only a brief announcement or report exists, must be based on other factors. Contemporary importance was often measured by the amount of money at stake and the fact that a match was deemed notable enough to be reported in the press. The 18th century matches in the ACS list were primarily compiled to assist historians. The earliest match known to have been accorded superior status in a contemporary report (i.e., termed &quot;a great match&quot; in this case) and to have been played for a large sum of money was one in Sussex between two unnamed eleven-a-side teams contesting &quot;fifty guineas apiece&quot; in June 1697, a match of enormous historical significance but with no statistical data recorded.

<text>Ferdinand de Saussure (; ; 26 November 185722 February 1913) was a Swiss linguist, semiotician and philosopher. His ideas laid a foundation for many significant developments in both linguistics and semiotics in the 20th century. He is widely considered one of the founders of 20th-century linguistics and one of two major founders (together with Charles Sanders Peirce) of semiotics, or &quot;semiology&quot;, as Saussure called it.

One of his translators, Roy Harris, summarized Saussure&#x27;s contribution to linguistics and the study of &quot;the whole range of human sciences. It is particularly marked in linguistics, philosophy, psychoanalysis, psychology, sociology and anthropology.&quot; Although they have undergone extension and critique over time, the dimensions of organization introduced by Saussure continue to inform contemporary approaches to the phenomenon of language. As Leonard Bloomfield stated after reviewing the &quot;Cours&quot;: &quot;he has given us the theoretical basis for a science of human speech&quot;.

==Biography==
Saussure was born in Geneva in 1857. His father, Henri Louis Frédéric de Saussure, was a mineralogist, entomologist, and taxonomist. Saussure showed signs of considerable talent and intellectual ability as early as the age of fourteen. In the autumn of 1870, he began attending the private school called the Institution Martine (previously the Institution Lecoultre until 1969) in Geneva. There he lived with the family of a classmate, Elie David. After graduating at the top of class, Saussure expected to continue his studies at the Gymnase de Genève, but his father decided he was not mature enough at fourteen and a half, and sent him to the Collège de Genève instead. The college also housed the Gymnase de Genève and some of its teachers also taught at the Collège. Saussure, however, was not pleased, as he complained: &quot;I entered the Collège de Genève, to waste a year there as completely as a year can be wasted.&quot;

He spent the year studying Latin, Ancient Greek, and Sanskrit and taking a variety of courses at the University of Geneva. He also purposely avoided taking the course in general linguistics due to its bad reputation, arranging instead to study foundational works in comparative-historical linguistics with Louis Morel, a &quot;Privatdozent&quot;. He commenced graduate work at the University of Leipzig and arrived at the university in October 1876.

Two years later, at 21, Saussure published a book entitled &quot;Mémoire sur le système primitif des voyelles dans les langues indo-européennes&quot; (&quot;Dissertation on the Primitive Vowel System in Indo-European Languages&quot;). After this, he studied for a year at the University of Berlin under the &quot;Privatdozent&quot; Heinrich Zimmer, with whom he studied Celtic and Hermann Oldenberg with whom he continued his studies of Sanskrit. He returned to Leipzig to defend his doctoral dissertation &quot;De l&#x27;emploi du génitif absolu en Sanscrit&quot;, and was awarded his doctorate in February 1880. Soon, he relocated to the University of Paris, where he lectured on Sanskrit, Gothic, Old High German, and occasionally other subjects.

Ferdinand de Saussure is one of the world&#x27;s most quoted linguists, which is remarkable as he hardly published anything during his lifetime. Even his few scientific articles are not unproblematic. Thus, for example, his publication on Lithuanian phonetics is mostly taken from studies by the Lithuanian researcher Friedrich Kurschat, with whom Saussure traveled through Lithuania in August 1880 for two weeks and whose (German) books Saussure had read. Saussure, who had studied some basic grammar of Lithuanian in Leipzig for one semester but was unable to speak the language, was thus dependent on Kurschat.

Saussure taught at the École pratique des hautes études for eleven years during which he was named Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur (Knight of the Legion of Honor). When offered a professorship in Geneva in 1892, he returned to Switzerland. Saussure lectured on Sanskrit and Indo-European at the University of Geneva for the remainder of his life. It was not until 1907 that Saussure began teaching the Course of General Linguistics, which he would offer three times, ending in the summer of 1911. He died in 1913 in Vufflens-le-Château, Vaud, Switzerland. His brothers were the linguist and Esperantist René de Saussure, and scholar of ancient Chinese astronomy, Léopold de Saussure. His son Raymond de Saussure was a psychiatrist and prolific psychoanalytic theorist, who was trained under Sigmund Freud himself.

Saussure attempted, at various times in the 1880s and 1890s, to write a book on general linguistic matters. His lectures about important principles of language description in Geneva between 1907 and 1911 were collected and published by his pupils posthumously in the famous &quot;Cours de linguistique générale&quot; in 1916. Work published in his lifetime includes two monographs and a few dozen papers and notes, all of them collected in a volume of some 600 pages published in 1922. Saussure did not publish anything of his work on ancient poetics even though he had filled more than a hundred notebooks. Jean Starobinski edited and presented material from them in the 1970s and more has been published since then. Some of his manuscripts, including an unfinished essay discovered in 1996, were published in &quot;Writings in General Linguistics&quot;, but most of the material in it had already been published in Engler&#x27;s critical edition of the &quot;Course&quot;, in 1967 and 1974. Today it is clear that &quot;Cours&quot; owes much to its so-called editors Charles Bally and Albert Sèchehaye and various details are difficult to track to Saussure himself or his manuscripts.

==Work and influence==
Saussure&#x27;s theoretical reconstructions of the Proto-Indo-European language vocalic system and particularly his theory of laryngeals, otherwise unattested at the time, bore fruit and found confirmation after the decipherment of Hittite in the work of later generations of linguists such as Émile Benveniste and Walter Couvreur, who both drew direct inspiration from their reading of the 1878 &quot;Mémoire&quot;.

Saussure had a major impact on the development of linguistic theory in the first half of the 20th century with his notions becoming incorporated in the central tenets of structural linguistics. His main contributions to structuralism include his notion of the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign. There is also his theory of a two-tiered reality about language. The first is the &quot;langue&quot;, the abstract and invisible layer, while the second, the &quot;parole&quot;, refers to the actual speech that we hear in real life. This framework was later adopted by Claude Levi-Strauss, who used the two-tiered model to determine the reality of myths. His idea was that all myths have an underlying pattern, which forms the structure that makes them myths.

In Europe, the most important work after Saussure&#x27;s death was done by the Prague school. Most notably, Nikolay Trubetzkoy and Roman Jakobson headed the efforts of the Prague School in setting the course of phonological theory in the decades from 1940. Jakobson&#x27;s universalizing structural-functional theory of phonology, based on a markedness hierarchy of distinctive features, was the first successful solution of a plane of linguistic analysis according to the Saussurean hypotheses. Elsewhere, Louis Hjelmslev and the Copenhagen School proposed new interpretations of linguistics from structuralist theoretical frameworks.

In America, where the term &#x27;structuralism&#x27; became highly ambiguous, Saussure&#x27;s ideas informed the distributionalism of Leonard Bloomfield, but his influence remained limited. Systemic functional linguistics is a theory considered to be based firmly on the Saussurean principles of the sign, albeit with some modifications. Ruqaiya Hasan describes systemic functional linguistics as a &#x27;post-Saussurean&#x27; linguistic theory. Michael Halliday argues:

===&quot;Course in General Linguistics&quot;===
Saussure&#x27;s most influential work, &quot;Course in General Linguistics&quot; (&quot;Cours de linguistique générale&quot;), was published posthumously in 1916 by former students Charles Bally and Albert Sechehaye, based on notes taken from Saussure&#x27;s lectures in Geneva. The &quot;Course&quot; became one of the linguistics works of the 20th century not primarily for the content (many of the ideas had been anticipated in the works of other 20th-century linguists) but for the innovative approach that Saussure applied in discussing linguistic phenomena.

Its central notion is that language may be analyzed as a formal system of differential elements, apart from the messy dialectics of real-time production and comprehension. Examples of these elements include his notion of the linguistic sign, which is composed of the signifier and the signified. Though the sign may also have a referent, Saussure took that to lie beyond the linguist&#x27;s purview.

Throughout the book, he stated that a linguist can develop a diachronic analysis of a text or theory of language but must learn just as much or more about the language/text as it exists at any moment in time (i.e. &quot;synchronically&quot;): &quot;Language is a system of signs that expresses ideas&quot;. A science that studies the life of signs within society and is a part of social and general psychology. Saussure believed that semiotics is concerned with everything that can be taken as a sign, and he called it semiology.

===Laryngeal theory===

While a student, Saussure published an important work about Proto-Indo-European, which explained unusual forms of word roots in terms of lost phonemes he called &quot;sonant coefficients&quot;. The Scandinavian scholar Hermann Möller suggested that they might be laryngeal consonants, leading to what is now known as the laryngeal theory. After Hittite texts were discovered and deciphered, Polish linguist Jerzy Kuryłowicz recognized that a Hittite consonant stood in the positions where Saussure had theorized a lost phoneme some 48 years earlier, confirming the theory. It has been argued that Saussure&#x27;s work on this problem, systematizing the irregular word forms by hypothesizing then-unknown phonemes, stimulated his development of structuralism.

===Influence outside linguistics===
The principles and methods employed by structuralism were later adapted in diverse fields by French intellectuals such as Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Claude Lévi-Strauss. Such scholars took influence from Saussure&#x27;s ideas in their areas of study (literary studies/philosophy, psychoanalysis, anthropology, etc.).

==View of language==

Saussure approaches the theory of language from two different perspectives. On the one hand, language is a system of signs. That is, a semiotic system; or a semiological system as he calls it. On the other hand, a language is also a social phenomenon: a product of the language community.

===Language as semiology===

====The bilateral sign====

One of Saussure&#x27;s key contributions to semiotics lies in what he called &quot;semiology&quot;, the concept of the bilateral (two-sided) sign which consists of &#x27;the signifier&#x27; (a linguistic form, e.g. a word) and &#x27;the signified&#x27; (the meaning of the form). Saussure supported the argument for the arbitrariness of the sign although he did not deny the fact that some words are onomatopoeic, or claim that picture-like symbols are fully arbitrary. Saussure also did not consider the linguistic sign as random, but as historically cemented. All in all, he did not invent the philosophy of arbitrariness but made a very influential contribution to it.

The arbitrariness of words of different languages itself is a fundamental concept in Western thinking of language, dating back to Ancient Greek philosophers. The question of whether words are natural or arbitrary (and artificially made by people) returned as a controversial topic during the Age of Enlightenment when the medieval scholastic dogma, that languages were created by God, became opposed by the advocates of humanistic philosophy. There were efforts to construct a &#x27;universal language&#x27;, based on the lost Adamic language, with various attempts to uncover universal words or characters which would be readily understood by all people regardless of their nationality. John Locke, on the other hand, was among those who believed that languages were a rational human innovation, and argued for the arbitrariness of words.

Saussure took it for granted in his time that &quot;No one disputes the principle of the arbitrary nature of the sign.&quot; He however disagreed with the common notion that each word corresponds &quot;to the thing that it names&quot; or what is called the referent in modern semiotics. For example, in Saussure&#x27;s notion, the word &#x27;tree&#x27; does not refer to a tree as a physical object, but to the psychological &quot;concept&quot; of a tree. The linguistic sign thus arises from the psychological &quot;association&quot; between the signifier (a &#x27;sound-image&#x27;) and the signified (a &#x27;concept&#x27;). There can therefore be no linguistic expression without meaning, but also no meaning without linguistic expression. Saussure&#x27;s structuralism, as it later became called, therefore includes an implication of linguistic relativity. However, Saussure&#x27;s view has been described instead as a form of semantic holism that acknowledged that the interconnection between terms in a language was not fully arbitrary and only methodologically bracketed the relationship between linguistic terms and the physical world.

The naming of spectral colours exemplifies how meaning and expression arise simultaneously from their interlinkage. Different colour frequencies are per se meaningless, or mere &quot;substance&quot; or meaning potential. Likewise, phonemic combinations that are not associated with any content are only meaningless expression potential, and therefore not considered as &quot;signs&quot;. It is only when a region of the spectrum is outlined and given an arbitrary name, for example, &#x27;blue&#x27;, that the sign emerges. The sign consists of the &quot;signifier&quot; (&#x27;blue&#x27;) and the &quot;signified&quot; (the colour region), and of the associative link which connects them. Arising from an arbitrary demarcation of meaning potential, the signified is not a property of the physical world. In Saussure&#x27;s concept, language is ultimately not a function of reality, but a self-contained system. Thus, Saussure&#x27;s semiology entails a bilateral (two-sided) perspective of semiotics.

The same idea is applied to any concept. For example, natural law does not dictate which plants are &#x27;trees&#x27; and which are &#x27;shrubs&#x27; or a different type of woody plant; or whether these should be divided into further groups. Like blue, all signs gain semantic &quot;value&quot; in opposition to other signs of the system (e.g. red, colourless). If more signs emerge (e.g. &#x27;marine blue&#x27;), the semantic field of the original word may narrow down. Conversely, words may become antiquated, whereby competition for the semantic field lessens. Or, the meaning of a word may change altogether.

After his death, structural and functional linguists applied Saussure&#x27;s concept to the analysis of the linguistic form as motivated by meaning. The opposite direction of the linguistic expressions as giving rise to the conceptual system, on the other hand, became the foundation of the post-Second World War structuralists who adopted Saussure&#x27;s concept of structural linguistics as the model for all human sciences as the study of how language shapes our concepts of the world. Thus, Saussure&#x27;s model became important not only for linguistics but for humanities and social sciences as a whole.

====Opposition theory====
A second key contribution comes from Saussure&#x27;s notion of the organisation of language based on the principle of opposition. Saussure made a distinction between meaning (significance) and &quot;value&quot;. On the semantic side, concepts gain value by being contrasted with related concepts, creating a conceptual system that could in modern terms be described as a semantic network. On the level of the sound-image, phonemes and morphemes gain value by being contrasted with related phonemes and morphemes; and on the level of the grammar, parts of speech gain value by being contrasted with each other. Each element within each system is eventually contrasted with all other elements in different types of relations so that no two elements have the same value:

:&quot;Within the same language, all words used to express related ideas limit each other reciprocally; synonyms like French &quot;redouter&quot; &#x27;dread&#x27;, &quot;craindre&quot; &#x27;fear,&#x27; and &quot;avoir peur&quot; &#x27;be afraid&#x27; have value only through their opposition: if &quot;redouter&quot; did not exist, all its content would go to its competitors.&quot;

Saussure defined his theory in terms of binary oppositions: &quot;sign—signified, meaning—value, language—speech, synchronic—diachronic, internal linguistics—external linguistics&quot;, and so on. The related term markedness denotes the assessment of value between binary oppositions. These were studied extensively by post-war structuralists such as Claude Lévi-Strauss to explain the organisation of social conceptualisation, and later by the post-structuralists to criticise it. Cognitive semantics also diverges from Saussure on this point, emphasizing the importance of similarity in defining categories in the mind as well as opposition.

Based on markedness theory, the Prague Linguistic Circle made great advances in the study of phonetics reforming it as the systemic study of phonology. Although the terms opposition and markedness are rightly associated with Saussure&#x27;s concept of language as a semiological system, he did not invent the terms and concepts that had been discussed by various 19th-century grammarians before him.

===Language as a social phenomenon===
In his treatment of language as a &#x27;social fact&#x27;, Saussure touches on topics that were controversial in his time, and that would continue to split opinions in the post-war structuralist movement. Saussure&#x27;s relationship with 19th-century theories of language was somewhat ambivalent. These included social Darwinism and Völkerpsychologie or Volksgeist thinking which were regarded by many intellectuals as nationalist and racist pseudoscience.

Saussure, however, considered the ideas useful if treated properly. Instead of discarding August Schleicher&#x27;s organicism or Heymann Steinthal&#x27;s &quot;spirit of the nation&quot;, he restricted their sphere in ways that were meant to preclude any chauvinistic interpretations.

Organic analogy

Saussure exploited the sociobiological concept of language as a living organism. He criticises August Schleicher and Max Müller&#x27;s ideas of languages as organisms struggling for living space but settles with promoting the idea of linguistics as a natural science as long as the study of the &#x27;organism&#x27; of language excludes its adaptation to its territory. This concept would be modified in post-Saussurean linguistics by the Prague circle linguists Roman Jakobson and Nikolai Trubetzkoy, and eventually diminished.

====The speech circuit====
Perhaps the most famous of Saussure&#x27;s ideas is the distinction between language and speech (Fr. &quot;langue et parole&quot;), with &#x27;speech&#x27; referring to the individual occurrences of language usage. These constitute two parts of three of Saussure&#x27;s &#x27;speech circuit&#x27; (&quot;circuit de parole&quot;). The third part is the brain, that is, the mind of the individual member of the language community. This idea is in principle borrowed from Steinthal, so Saussure&#x27;s concept of a language as a social fact corresponds to &quot;Volksgeist&quot;, although he was careful to preclude any nationalistic interpretations. In Saussure&#x27;s and Durkheim&#x27;s thinking, social facts and norms do not elevate the individuals but shackle them. Saussure&#x27;s definition of language is statistical rather than idealised.

::&quot;Among all the individuals that are linked together by speech, some sort of average will be set up : all will reproduce — not exactly of course, but approximately — the same signs united with the same concepts.&quot;

Saussure argues that language is a &#x27;social fact&#x27;; a conventionalised set of rules or norms relating to speech. When at least two people are engaged in conversation, there forms a communicative circuit between the minds of the individual speakers. Saussure explains that language, as a social system, is neither situated in &quot;speech&quot; nor the mind. It only properly exists between the two within the loop. It is located in – and is the product of – the collective mind of the linguistic group. An individual has to learn the normative rules of language and can never control them.

The task of the linguist is to study the language by analysing samples of speech. For practical reasons, this is ordinarily the analysis of written texts. The idea that language is studied through texts is by no means revolutionary as it had been the common practice since the beginning of linguistics. Saussure does not advise against introspection and takes up many linguistic examples without reference to a source in a text corpus. The idea that linguistics is not the study of the mind, however, contradicts Wilhelm Wundt&#x27;s Völkerpsychologie in Saussure&#x27;s contemporary context; and in a later context, generative grammar and cognitive linguistics.

==A legacy of ideological disputes==

===Structuralism versus generative grammar===

Saussure&#x27;s influence was restricted to American linguistics which was dominated by the advocates of Wilhelm Wundt&#x27;s psychological approach to language, especially Leonard Bloomfield (1887–1949). The Bloomfieldian school rejected Saussure&#x27;s and other structuralists&#x27; sociological or even anti-psychological (e.g. Louis Hjelmslev, Lucien Tesnière) approaches to the theory of language. Problematically, the post-Bloomfieldian school was nicknamed &#x27;American structuralism&#x27;. Although Bloomfield denounced Wundt&#x27;s Völkerpsychologie and opted for behavioural psychology in his 1933 textbook &quot;Language&quot;, he and other American linguists stuck to Wundt&#x27;s practice of analysing the grammatical object as part of the verb phrase. Since this practice is not semantically motivated, they argued for the disconnectedness of syntax from semantics, thus fully rejecting structuralism.

The question remained why the object should be in the verb phrase, vexing American linguists for decades. The post-Bloomfieldian approach was eventually reformed as a sociobiological framework by Noam Chomsky who argued that linguistics is a cognitive science; and claimed that linguistic structures are the manifestation of a random mutation in the human genome. Advocates of the new school, generative grammar, claim that Saussure&#x27;s structuralism has been reformed and replaced by Chomsky&#x27;s modern approach to linguistics. Jan Koster asserts:

::it is certainly the case that Saussure considered the most important linguist of the century in Europe until the 1950s, hardly plays a role in current theoretical thinking about language. As a result of the Chomskyan revolution, linguistics has gone through a number of conceptual transformations which have led to all kinds of technical pre-occupations that are far beyond linguistic practice of the days of Saussure. For the most it seems Saussure has rightly sunk into near oblivion.

French historian and philosopher François Dosse however argues that there have been various misunderstandings. He points out that Chomsky&#x27;s criticism of &#x27;structuralism&#x27; is directed at the Bloomfieldian school and not the proper address of the term; and that structural linguistics is not to be reduced to mere sentence analysis. It is also argued that

::&quot;&#x27;Chomsky the Saussurean&#x27; is nothing but &quot;an academic fable&quot;. This fable is a result of misreading – by Chomsky himself (1964) and also by others – of Saussure&#x27;s &quot;la langue&quot; (in the singular form) as generativist concept of &#x27;competence&#x27; and, therefore, its grammar as the Universal Grammar (UG).&quot;

===Saussure versus the social Darwinists===

Saussure&#x27;s &quot;Course in General Linguistics&quot; begins and ends with a criticism of 19th-century linguistics where he is especially critical of Volkgeist thinking and the evolutionary linguistics of August Schleicher and his colleagues. Saussure&#x27;s ideas replaced social Darwinism in Europe as it was banished from humanities at the end of World War II.

The publication of Richard Dawkins&#x27;s memetics in 1976 brought the Darwinian idea of linguistic units as cultural replicators back to vogue. It became necessary for adherents of this movement to redefine linguistics in a way that would be simultaneously anti-Saussurean and anti-Chomskyan. This led to a redefinition of old humanistic terms such as structuralism, formalism, functionalism, and constructionism along Darwinian lines through debates that were marked by an acrimonious tone. In a functionalism–formalism debate of the decades following &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, the &#x27;functionalism&#x27; camp attacking Saussure&#x27;s legacy includes frameworks such as Cognitive Linguistics, Construction Grammar, Usage-based linguistics, and Emergent Linguistics. Arguing for &#x27;functional-typological theory&#x27;, William Croft criticises Saussure&#x27;s use of the organic analogy:

::When comparing functional-typological theory to biological theory, one must take care to avoid a caricature of the latter. In particular, in comparing the structure of language to an ecosystem, one must not assume that in contemporary biological theory, it is believed that an organism possesses a perfect adaptation to a stable niche inside an ecosystem in equilibrium. The analogy of a language as a perfectly adapted &#x27;organic&#x27; system where &quot;tout se tient&quot; is a characteristic of the structuralist approach, and was prominent in early structuralist writing. The static view of adaptation in biology is not tenable in the face of empirical evidence of nonadaptive variation and competing adaptive motivations of organisms.

Structural linguist Henning Andersen disagrees with Croft. He criticises memetics and other models of cultural evolution and points out that the concept of &#x27;adaptation&#x27; is not to be taken in linguistics in the same meaning as in biology. Humanistic and structuralistic notions are likewise defended by Esa Itkonen and Jacques François; the Saussurean standpoint is explained and defended by Tomáš Hoskovec, representing the Prague Linguistic Circle.

Conversely, other cognitive linguists claim to continue and expand Saussure&#x27;s work on the bilateral sign. Dutch philologist Elise Elffers, however, argues that their view of the subject is incompatible with Saussure&#x27;s ideas.

The term &#x27;structuralism&#x27; continues to be used in structural–functional linguistics which despite the contrary claims defines itself as a humanistic approach to language.

<text>In nutrition, biology, and chemistry, fat usually means any ester of fatty acids, or a mixture of such compounds, most commonly those that occur in living beings or in food.

The term often refers specifically to triglycerides (triple esters of glycerol), that are the main components of vegetable oils and of fatty tissue in animals; or, even more narrowly, to triglycerides that are solid or semisolid at room temperature, thus excluding oils. The term may also be used more broadly as a synonym of lipid—any substance of biological relevance, composed of carbon, hydrogen, or oxygen, that is insoluble in water but soluble in non-polar solvents. In this sense, besides the triglycerides, the term would include several other types of compounds like mono- and diglycerides, phospholipids (such as lecithin), sterols (such as cholesterol), waxes (such as beeswax), and free fatty acids, which are usually present in human diet in smaller amounts.

Fats are one of the three main macronutrient groups in human diet, along with carbohydrates and proteins, and the main components of common food products like milk, butter, tallow, lard, salt pork, and cooking oils. They are a major and dense source of food energy for many animals and play important structural and metabolic functions in most living beings, including energy storage, waterproofing, and thermal insulation. The human body can produce the fat it requires from other food ingredients, except for a few essential fatty acids that must be included in the diet. Dietary fats are also the carriers of some flavor and aroma ingredients and vitamins that are not water-soluble.

== Biological importance ==
In humans and many animals, fats serve both as energy sources and as stores for energy in excess of what the body needs immediately. Each gram of fat when burned or metabolized releases about nine food calories (37 kJ = 8.8 kcal).

Fats are also sources of essential fatty acids, an important dietary requirement. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat-soluble, meaning they can only be digested, absorbed, and transported in conjunction with fats.

Fats play a vital role in maintaining healthy skin and hair, insulating body organs against shock, maintaining body temperature, and promoting healthy cell function. Fat also serves as a useful buffer against a host of diseases. When a particular substance, whether chemical or biotic, reaches unsafe levels in the bloodstream, the body can effectively dilute—or at least maintain equilibrium of—the offending substances by storing it in new fat tissue. This helps to protect vital organs, until such time as the offending substances can be metabolized or removed from the body by such means as excretion, urination, accidental or intentional bloodletting, sebum excretion, and hair growth.

===Adipose tissue===

In animals, adipose tissue, or fatty tissue is the body&#x27;s means of storing metabolic energy over extended periods of time. Adipocytes (fat cells) store fat derived from the diet and from liver metabolism. Under energy stress these cells may degrade their stored fat to supply fatty acids and also glycerol to the circulation. These metabolic activities are regulated by several hormones (e.g., insulin, glucagon and epinephrine). Adipose tissue also secretes the hormone leptin.

==Production and processing==
A variety of chemical and physical techniques are used for the production and processing of fats, both industrially and in cottage or home settings. They include:
* Pressing to extract liquid fats from fruits, seeds, or algae, e.g. olive oil from olives
* Solvent extraction using solvents like hexane or supercritical carbon dioxide
* Rendering, the melting of fat in adipose tissue, e.g. to produce tallow, lard, fish oil, and whale oil
* Churning of milk to produce butter
* Hydrogenation to increase the degree of saturation of the fatty acids
* Interesterification, the rearrangement of fatty acids across different triglycerides
* Winterization to remove oil components with higher melting points
* Clarification of butter

== Metabolism ==

The pancreatic lipase acts at the ester bond, hydrolyzing the bond and &quot;releasing&quot; the fatty acid. In triglyceride form, lipids cannot be absorbed by the duodenum. Fatty acids, monoglycerides (one glycerol, one fatty acid), and some diglycerides are absorbed by the duodenum, once the triglycerides have been broken down.

In the intestine, following the secretion of lipases and bile, triglycerides are split into monoacylglycerol and free fatty acids in a process called lipolysis. They are subsequently moved to absorptive enterocyte cells lining the intestines. The triglycerides are rebuilt in the enterocytes from their fragments and packaged together with cholesterol and proteins to form chylomicrons. These are excreted from the cells and collected by the lymph system and transported to the large vessels near the heart before being mixed into the blood. Various tissues can capture the chylomicrons, releasing the triglycerides to be used as a source of energy. Liver cells can synthesize and store triglycerides. When the body requires fatty acids as an energy source, the hormone glucagon signals the breakdown of the triglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase to release free fatty acids. As the brain cannot utilize fatty acids as an energy source (unless converted to a ketone), the glycerol component of triglycerides can be converted into glucose, via gluconeogenesis by conversion into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and then into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, for brain fuel when it is broken down. Fat cells may also be broken down for that reason if the brain&#x27;s needs ever outweigh the body&#x27;s.

Triglycerides cannot pass through cell membranes freely. Special enzymes on the walls of blood vessels called lipoprotein lipases must break down triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids can then be taken up by cells via fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs).

Triglycerides, as major components of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons, play an important role in metabolism as energy sources and transporters of dietary fat. They contain more than twice as much energy (approximately 9kcal/g or 38kJ/g) as carbohydrates (approximately 4kcal/g or 17kJ/g).

==Nutritional and health aspects==
The most common type of fat, in human diet and most living beings, is a triglyceride, an ester of the triple alcohol glycerol and three fatty acids. The molecule of a triglyceride can be described as resulting from a condensation reaction (specifically, esterification) between each of glycerol&#x27;s –OH groups and the HO– part of the carboxyl group of each fatty acid, forming an ester bridge with elimination of a water molecule .

Other less common types of fats include diglycerides and monoglycerides, where the esterification is limited to two or just one of glycerol&#x27;s –OH groups. Other alcohols, such as cetyl alcohol (predominant in spermaceti), may replace glycerol. In the phospholipids, one of the fatty acids is replaced by phosphoric acid or a monoester thereof.
The benefits and risks of various amounts and types of dietary fats have been the object of much study, and are still highly controversial topics.

===Essential fatty acids===
There are two essential fatty acids (EFAs) in human nutrition: alpha-Linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) and linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid). The adult body can synthesize other lipids that it needs from these two.

==Dietary sources==
===Saturated vs. unsaturated fats===

Different foods contain different amounts of fat with different proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Some animal products, like beef and dairy products made with whole or reduced fat milk like yogurt, ice cream, cheese and butter have mostly saturated fatty acids (and some have significant contents of dietary cholesterol). Other animal products, like pork, poultry, eggs, and seafood have mostly unsaturated fats. Industrialized baked goods may use fats with high unsaturated fat contents as well, especially those containing partially hydrogenated oils, and processed foods that are deep-fried in hydrogenated oil are high in saturated fat content.

Plants and fish oil generally contain a higher proportion of unsaturated acids, although there are exceptions such as coconut oil and palm kernel oil. Foods containing unsaturated fats include avocado, nuts, olive oils, and vegetable oils such as canola.

Many scientific studies have found that replacing saturated fats with &quot;cis&quot; unsaturated fats in the diet reduces risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, or death. These studies prompted many medical organizations and public health departments, including the World Health Organization (WHO), to officially issue that advice. Some countries with such recommendations include:

* United Kingdom
* United States
* India
* Canada
* Australia
* Singapore
* New Zealand
* Hong Kong

A 2004 review concluded that &quot;no lower safe limit of specific saturated fatty acid intakes has been identified&quot; and recommended that the influence of varying saturated fatty acid intakes against a background of different individual lifestyles and genetic backgrounds should be the focus in future studies.

This advice is often oversimplified by labeling the two kinds of fats as &quot;bad fats&quot; and &quot;good fats&quot;, respectively. However, since the fats and oils in most natural and traditionally processed foods contain both unsaturated and saturated fatty acids, the complete exclusion of saturated fat is unrealistic and possibly unwise. For instance, some foods rich in saturated fat, such as coconut and palm oil, are an important source of cheap dietary calories for a large fraction of the population in developing countries.

Concerns were also expressed at a 2010 conference of the American Dietetic Association that a blanket recommendation to avoid saturated fats could drive people to also reduce the amount of polyunsaturated fats, which may have health benefits, and/or replace fats by refined carbohydrates — which carry a high risk of obesity and heart disease.

For these reasons, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, recommends to consume less than 10% (7% for high-risk groups) of calories from saturated fat, with 15-30% of total calories from all fat. A general 7% limit was recommended also by the American Heart Association (AHA) in 2006.

The WHO/FAO report also recommended replacing fats so as to reduce the content of myristic and palmitic acids, specifically.

The so-called Mediterranean diet, prevalent in many countries in the Mediterranean Sea area, includes more total fat than the diet of Northern European countries, but most of it is in the form of unsaturated fatty acids (specifically, monounsaturated and omega-3) from olive oil and fish, vegetables, and certain meats like lamb, while consumption of saturated fat is minimal in comparison.
A 2017 review found evidence that a Mediterranean-style diet could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, overall cancer incidence, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and mortality rate. A 2018 review showed that a Mediterranean-like diet may improve overall health status, such as reduced risk of non-communicable diseases. It also may reduce the social and economic costs of diet-related illnesses.

A small number of contemporary reviews have challenged this negative view of saturated fats. For example, an evaluation of evidence from 1966 to 1973 of the observed health impact of replacing dietary saturated fat with linoleic acid found that it &quot;increased&quot; rates of death from all causes, coronary heart disease, and cardiovascular disease. These studies have been disputed by many scientists, and the consensus in the medical community is that saturated fat and cardiovascular disease are closely related. Still, these discordant studies fueled debate over the merits of substituting polyunsaturated fats for saturated fats.

====Cardiovascular disease====
The effect of saturated fat on cardiovascular disease has been extensively studied. The general consensus is that there is evidence of moderate-quality of a strong, consistent, and graded relationship between saturated fat intake, blood cholesterol levels, and the incidence of cardiovascular disease. The relationships are accepted as causal, including by many government and medical organizations.

A 2017 review by the AHA estimated that replacement of saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat in the American diet could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by 30%.

The consumption of saturated fat is generally considered a risk factor for dyslipidemia—abnormal blood lipid levels, including high total cholesterol, high levels of triglycerides, high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol) or low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL, &quot;good&quot; cholesterol). These parameters in turn are believed to be risk indicators for some types of cardiovascular disease. These effects were observed in children too.

Several meta-analyses (reviews and consolidations of multiple previously published experimental studies) have confirmed a significant relationship between saturated fat and high serum cholesterol levels, which in turn have been claimed to have a causal relation with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (the so-called lipid hypothesis). However, high cholesterol may be caused by many factors. Other indicators, such as high LDL/HDL ratio, have proved to be more predictive. In a study of myocardial infarction in 52 countries, the ApoB/ApoA1 (related to LDL and HDL, respectively) ratio was the strongest predictor of CVD among all risk factors. There are other pathways involving obesity, triglyceride levels, insulin sensitivity, endothelial function, and thrombogenicity, among others, that play a role in CVD, although it seems, in the absence of an adverse blood lipid profile, the other known risk factors have only a weak atherogenic effect. Different saturated fatty acids have differing effects on various lipid levels.

====Cancer====
The evidence for a relation between saturated fat intake and cancer is significantly weaker, and there does not seem to be a clear medical consensus about it.

* Several reviews of case–control studies have found that saturated fat intake is associated with increased breast cancer risk.
* Another review found limited evidence for a positive relationship between consuming animal fat and incidence of colorectal cancer.
* Other meta-analyses found evidence for increased risk of ovarian cancer by high consumption of saturated fat.
* Some studies have indicated that serum myristic acid and palmitic acid and dietary myristic and palmitic saturated fatty acids and serum palmitic combined with alpha-tocopherol supplementation are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in a dose-dependent manner. These associations may, however, reflect differences in intake or metabolism of these fatty acids between the precancer cases and controls, rather than being an actual cause.

====Bones====
Various animal studies have indicated that the intake of saturated fat has a negative effect on the mineral density of bones. One study suggested that men may be particularly vulnerable.

====Disposition and overall health====

Studies have shown that substituting monounsaturated fatty acids for saturated ones is associated with increased daily physical activity and resting energy expenditure. More physical activity, less anger, and less irritability were associated with a higher-oleic acid diet than one of a palmitic acid diet.

===Monounsaturated vs. polyunsaturated fat===

The most common fatty acids in human diet are unsaturated or mono-unsaturated. Monounsaturated fats are found in animal flesh such as red meat, whole milk products, nuts, and high fat fruits such as olives and avocados. Olive oil is about 75% monounsaturated fat. The high oleic variety sunflower oil contains at least 70% monounsaturated fat. Canola oil and cashews are both about 58% monounsaturated fat. Tallow (beef fat) is about 50% monounsaturated fat, and lard is about 40% monounsaturated fat. Other sources include hazelnut, avocado oil, macadamia nut oil, grapeseed oil, groundnut oil (peanut oil), sesame oil, corn oil, popcorn, whole grain wheat, cereal, oatmeal, almond oil, hemp oil, and tea-oil camellia.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids can be found mostly in nuts, seeds, fish, seed oils, and oysters.

Food sources of polyunsaturated fats include:
==== Insulin resistance and sensitivity ====

MUFAs (especially oleic acid) have been found to lower the incidence of insulin resistance; PUFAs (especially large amounts of arachidonic acid) and SFAs (such as arachidic acid) increased it. These ratios can be indexed in the phospholipids of human skeletal muscle and in other tissues as well. This relationship between dietary fats and insulin resistance is presumed secondary to the relationship between insulin resistance and inflammation, which is partially modulated by dietary fat ratios (omega−3/6/9) with both omega−3 and −9 thought to be anti-inflammatory, and omega−6 pro-inflammatory (as well as by numerous other dietary components, particularly polyphenols and exercise, with both of these anti-inflammatory). Although both pro- and anti-inflammatory types of fat are biologically necessary, fat dietary ratios in most US diets are skewed towards omega−6, with subsequent disinhibition of inflammation and potentiation of insulin resistance. This is contrary to the suggestion that polyunsaturated fats are shown to be protective against insulin resistance.

The large scale KANWU study found that increasing MUFA and decreasing SFA intake could improve insulin sensitivity, but only when the overall fat intake of the diet was low. However, some MUFAs may promote insulin resistance (like the SFAs), whereas PUFAs may protect against it.

====Cancer====
Levels of oleic acid along with other MUFAs in red blood cell membranes were positively associated with breast cancer risk. The saturation index (SI) of the same membranes was inversely associated with breast cancer risk. MUFAs and low SI in erythrocyte membranes are predictors of postmenopausal breast cancer. Both of these variables depend on the activity of the enzyme delta-9 desaturase (Δ9-d).

Results from observational clinical trials on PUFA intake and cancer have been inconsistent and vary by numerous factors of cancer incidence, including gender and genetic risk. Some studies have shown associations between higher intakes and/or blood levels of omega-3 PUFAs and a decreased risk of certain cancers, including breast and colorectal cancer, while other studies found no associations with cancer risk.

====Pregnancy disorders====
Polyunsaturated fat supplementation was found to have no effect on the incidence of pregnancy-related disorders, such as hypertension or preeclampsia, but may increase the length of gestation slightly and decreased the incidence of early premature births.

Expert panels in the United States and Europe recommend that pregnant and lactating women consume higher amounts of polyunsaturated fats than the general population to enhance the DHA status of the fetus and newborn.

===&quot;Cis fat&quot; vs. &quot;trans fat&quot;===

In nature, unsaturated fatty acids generally have double bonds in &quot;cis&quot; configuration (with the adjacent C–C bonds on the same side) as opposed to &quot;trans&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;trans&quot; fatty acids (TFAs) occur in small amounts in meat and milk of ruminants (such as cattle and sheep), typically 2–5% of total fat. Natural TFAs, which include conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and vaccenic acid, originate in the rumen of these animals. CLA has two double bonds, one in the &quot;cis&quot; configuration and one in &quot;trans&quot;, which makes it simultaneously a &quot;cis&quot;- and a &quot;trans&quot;-fatty acid.
The processing of fats by hydrogenation can convert some unsaturated fats into trans fat]]s. The presence of trans fats in various processed foods has received much attention. 


===Omega-three and omega-six fatty acids===

The ω−3 fatty acids have received substantial attention. Among omega-3 fatty acids, neither long-chain nor short-chain forms were consistently associated with breast cancer risk. High levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), however, the most abundant omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid in erythrocyte (red blood cell) membranes, were associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. The DHA obtained through the consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids is positively associated with cognitive and behavioral performance. In addition, DHA is vital for the grey matter structure of the human brain, as well as retinal stimulation and neurotransmission.

===Interesterification===
Some studies have investigated the health effects of interesterified (IE) fats, by comparing diets with IE and non-IE fats with the same overall fatty acid composition.

Several experimental studies in humans found no statistical difference on fasting blood lipids between a diet with large amounts of IE fat, having 25-40% C16:0 or C18:0 on the 2-position, and a similar diet with non-IE fat, having only 3-9% C16:0 or C18:0 on the 2-position. A negative result was obtained also in a study that compared the effects on blood cholesterol levels of an IE fat product mimicking cocoa butter and the real non-IE product.

A 2007 study funded by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board claimed that replacing natural palm oil by other interesterified or partially hydrogenated fats caused adverse health effects, such as higher LDL/HDL ratio and plasma glucose levels. However, these effects could be attributed to the higher percentage of saturated acids in the IE and partially hydrogenated fats, rather than to the IE process itself.

===Rancification===

Unsaturated fats undergo auto-oxidation, which involves replacement of a C-H bond with C-OH unit. The process requires oxygen (air) and is accelerated by the presence of traces of metals, which serve as catalysts. Doubly unsaturated fatty acids are particularly prone to this reaction. Vegetable oils resist this process to a small degree because they contain antioxidants, such as tocopherol. Fats and oils often are treated with chelating agents such as citric acid to remove the metal catalysts.
===Role in disease===

In the human body, high levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream have been linked to atherosclerosis, heart disease
and stroke. However, the relative negative impact of raised levels of triglycerides compared to that of LDL:HDL ratios is as yet unknown. The risk can be partly accounted for by a strong inverse relationship between triglyceride level and HDL-cholesterol level. But the risk is also due to high triglyceride levels increasing the quantity of small, dense LDL particles.

=== Guidelines ===
The National Cholesterol Education Program has set guidelines for triglyceride levels:
These levels are tested after fasting 8 to 12 hours. Triglyceride levels remain temporarily higher for a period after eating.

The AHA recommends an optimal triglyceride level of 100mg/dL (1.1mmol/L) or lower to improve heart health.

<text>A front line (alternatively front-line or frontline) in military terminology is the position(s) closest to the area of conflict of an armed force&#x27;s personnel and equipment, usually referring to land forces. When a front (an intentional or unintentional boundary) between opposing sides forms, the front line is the area where each side&#x27;s forces are engaged in conflict. Leaders have often fought at the front lines either purposefully or due to a collapse in battle formation. While a calculated risk, fighting on the front has in instances reduced communication and heightened morale. The front is in direct contrast to the rear, which is the position farthest from conflict.

All branches of the United States Armed Forces use the related technical terms, Forward Line of Own Troops (FLOT) and Forward Edge of Battle Area (FEBA). These terms are used as battlespace control measures that designate the forward-most friendly maritime or land forces on the battlefield at a given point in time during an armed conflict. FLOT/FEBA may include covering and screening forces. The Forward Line of Enemy Troops (FLET) is the FEBA from the enemy&#x27;s perspective.

==Etymology==
Although the term &quot;front line&quot; first appeared in the 1520s, it was only in 1842 that it was recorded used in the military sense. Its first use as an adjective was from 1915.

The word &quot;front&quot; gained the military sense of &quot;foremost part of an army&quot; in the mid-14th century, which, in turn, led the word to take on the meaning &quot;field of operations in contact with the enemy&quot; in the 1660s. That sense led to the phrase home front, which first appeared in 1919. In a non-combat situation or when a combat situation is not assumed, front can mean the direction in which the command is faced.

The attributive adjective version of the term front line (as in &quot;our front-line personnel&quot;) describes materiel or personnel intended for or actively in forward use: at sea, on land or in the air: &quot;at&quot; the front line.

==Evolution of the concept==
In the land campaigns of World War I, FEBAs, FLOTs and FLETs could often be identified by eye. For example, in France and Belgium they were defined by opposing defensive trench systems.

Typical modern conflicts are vastly different, characterised by &quot;war amongst the people&quot;, the concept of a &quot;Three Block War&quot;, and the presence of an asymmetric threat from irregular or terrorist combatants. In those cases, the concepts of front line, FEBA, FLOT and FLET may be of little relevance. The term &quot;front line&quot; has come to refer more to any place where bullets and bombs are flying or are likely to fly.

<text>The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (), more commonly known by its acronym FIFA ( ), is the international self-regulatory governing body of association football, beach soccer, and futsal. It was founded on 21 May 1904 to oversee international competition among the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain (represented by Real Madrid CF), Sweden, and Switzerland. Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, its membership now comprises 211 national associations. These national associations must also be members of one of the six regional confederations: CAF (Africa), AFC (Asia), UEFA (Europe), CONCACAF (North &amp; Central America and the Caribbean), OFC (Oceania), and CONMEBOL (South America).

FIFA outlines several objectives in its organizational statutes, including growing football internationally, ensuring it is accessible to everyone, and advocating for integrity and fair play. It is responsible for organizing and promoting football&#x27;s major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which began in 1930, and the Women&#x27;s World Cup which commenced in 1991. Although FIFA does not solely set the laws of the game, that being the responsibility of the International Football Association Board of which FIFA is a member, it applies and enforces the rules across all FIFA competitions. All FIFA tournaments generate revenue from sponsorships; in 2022, FIFA had revenues of over US$5.8 billion, ending the 2019–2022 cycle with a net positive of $1.2 billion, and cash reserves of over $3.9 billion.

Reports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging related to the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organization&#x27;s decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the US Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who launched a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the US are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well.

Many officials were suspended by FIFA&#x27;s ethics committee including Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini. In early 2017, reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections of both chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borbély and Hans-Joachim Eckert, during the FIFA congress in May 2017. On 9 May 2017, following Infantino&#x27;s proposal, The FIFA Council decided not to renew the mandates of Borbély and Eckert. Together with the chairmen, 11 of 13 committee members were removed. FIFA has been suspected of corruption regarding the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid.

==History==
The need for a single body to oversee association football became increasingly apparent at the beginning of the 20th century with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in the rear of the headquarters of the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques (USFSA) at the Rue Saint Honoré 229 in Paris on 21 May 1904. The French name and acronym are universally adopted outside French-speaking countries. The founding members were the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain (represented by then-Real Madrid CF; the Royal Spanish Football Federation was not created until 1913), Sweden and Switzerland.

On the same day, the German Football Association (DFB) declared its intention to affiliate through a telegram.

The first president of FIFA was Robert Guérin. Guérin was replaced in 1906 by Daniel Burley Woolfall from England, by then a member of the association. The first tournament FIFA staged, the association football competition for the 1908 Olympics in London was more successful than its Olympic predecessors, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding principles of FIFA.

Membership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the application of South Africa in 1909, Argentina in 1912, Canada and Chile in 1913, and the United States in 1914.

The 1912 Spalding Athletic Library &quot;Official Guide&quot; includes information on the 1912 Olympics (scores and stories), AAFA, and FIFA. The 1912 FIFA president was Dan B Woolfall. Daniel Burley Woolfall was president from 1906 to 1918.

During World War I, with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel for international fixtures severely limited, the organization&#x27;s survival was in doubt. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organization was run by Dutchman Carl Hirschmann. It was saved from extinction but at the cost of the withdrawal of the Home Nations (of the United Kingdom), who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their World War enemies. The Home Nations later resumed their membership. The FIFA collection is held by the National Football Museum at Urbis in Manchester, England. The first World Cup was held in 1930 in Montevideo, Uruguay.

==Identity==
=== Flag ===

The FIFA flag is blue, with the organization&#x27;s wordmark logo in the middle. The current FIFA flag was first flown during the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in Moscow, Russia.

===Anthem===
Akin to the UEFA Champions League, FIFA has adopted an anthem composed by the German composer Franz Lambert since the 1994 FIFA World Cup. It has been re-arranged and produced by Rob May and Simon Hill. The FIFA Anthem is played at the beginning of official FIFA sanctioned matches and tournaments such as international friendlies, the FIFA World Cup, FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, Football at the Summer Olympics, FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Cup, FIFA Women&#x27;s U-17 World Cup, FIFA Futsal World Cup, FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.

Since 2007, FIFA has also required most of its broadcast partners to use short sequences including the anthem at the beginning and end of FIFA event coverage and for break bumpers to help promote FIFA&#x27;s sponsors. This emulates practices long used by international football events, such as the UEFA Champions League. Exceptions may be made for specific circumstances; for example, an original piece of African music was used for bumpers during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

==Structure==

===Six confederations and 211 national associations===
Besides its worldwide institutions, there are six confederations recognized by FIFA which oversee the game in the different continents and regions of the world. National associations, and not the continental confederations, are members of FIFA. The continental confederations are provided for in FIFA&#x27;s statutes, and membership of a union is a prerequisite to FIFA membership.

* Asian Football Confederation (AFC; 47 members)
* Confederation of African Football (CAF; 54 members)
* Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF; 41 members)
*Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol (CONMEBOL; 10 members)
* Oceania Football Confederation (OFC; 13 members)
* Union of European Football Associations (UEFA; 55 members)

In total, FIFA recognizes 211 national associations and their associated men&#x27;s national teams as well as 129 women&#x27;s national teams; see the list of national football teams and their respective country codes. The number of FIFA member associations is higher than the number of UN member states as FIFA has admitted associations from 23 non-sovereign entities as members in their own right, such as the four Home Nations within the United Kingdom and the two special administrative regions of China: Hong Kong and Macau.

On 28 February 2022, FIFA suspended Russia from all competitions due to controversy surrounding Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

FIFA can suspend countries due to numerous multifaceted issues. Common reasons include governance interference, corruption, and financial irregularities. Doping or the misappropriation of drugs is also a consideration for expulsion.

The FIFA Men&#x27;s World Rankings are updated monthly and rank each team based on their performance in international competitions, qualifiers, and friendly matches. There is also a world ranking for women&#x27;s football, amended on a quarterly schedule.

===Laws and governance===

FIFA&#x27;s headquarters is in Zürich, and it is an association established under the law of Switzerland.

FIFA&#x27;s supreme body is the FIFA Congress, an assembly of representatives from each affiliated member association. Each national football association has one vote, regardless of size or footballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary sessions once every year, and extraordinary sessions have been held once a year since 1998. Congress makes decisions relating to FIFA&#x27;s governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only Congress can pass changes to FIFA&#x27;s statutes. The congress approves the annual report and decides on the acceptance of new national associations, and holds elections. Congress elects the President of FIFA, its general secretary, and the other members of the FIFA Council in the year following the FIFA World Cup.

FIFA Council – formerly called the FIFA Executive Committee and chaired by the president – is the organization&#x27;s main decision-making body in the intervals of Congress. The council comprises 37 people: the president; 8 vice-presidents; and 28 members from the confederations, with at least one of them being a woman. The executive committee is the body that decides which country will host the World Cup.

The president and the general secretary are the main office holders of FIFA and are in charge of its daily administration, carried in by the general secretariat, with its staff of approximately 280 members. Gianni Infantino is the current president, elected on 26 February 2016 at an extraordinary FIFA Congress session after former president Sepp Blatter was suspended pending a corruption investigation.

FIFA&#x27;s worldwide organizational structure also consists of several other bodies under the authority of the FIFA Council or created by Congress as standing committees. Among those bodies are the FIFA Emergency Committee, the FIFA Ethics Committee, the Finance Committee, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Referees Committee.

The FIFA Emergency Committee deals with all matters requiring immediate settlement in the time frame between the regular meetings of the FIFA Council. The Emergency Committee consists of the FIFA president as well as one member from each confederation. Emergency Committee decisions made are immediately put into legal effect, although they need to be ratified at the next Executive Committee meeting.

===Administrative cost===
FIFA publishes its results according to International Financial Reporting Standards. The total compensation for the management committee in 2011 was 30 million for 35 people. Blatter, the only full-time person on the committee, earned approximately two million Swiss francs, 1.2 million in salary, and the rest in bonuses. A report in London&#x27;s &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in June 2014 said the members of the committee had their salaries doubled from $100,000 to $200,000 during the year. The report also said leaked documents had indicated $4.4 million in secret bonuses had been paid to the committee members following the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.

==Governance==

The laws that govern football known officially as the Laws of the Game, are not solely the responsibility of FIFA; they are maintained by a body called the International Football Association Board (IFAB). FIFA has members on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the football associations of the United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognized for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed upon by at least six delegates.

The FIFA Statutes form the overarching document guiding FIFA&#x27;s governing system. The governing system is divided into separate bodies with the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances. It consists of four general bodies: the Congress, the executive committee, the general Secretariat, and standing and ad hoc committees.

===Discipline of national associations===
FIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world. One of its sanctions is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition when a government interferes in the running of FIFA&#x27;s associate member organizations or if the associate is not functioning correctly.

A 2007 FIFA ruling that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs and appear in official matches for a maximum of two in a year measured from 1 July to 30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier, as in the case of two former Ireland internationals. As a direct result of this controversy, FIFA modified this ruling the following year to accommodate transfers between leagues with out-of-phase seasons.

===Video replay and goal-line technology===
FIFA now permits the use of video evidence during matches, as well as for subsequent sanctions. However, for most of FIFA&#x27;s history it stood opposed to its use. The 1970 meeting of the International Football Association Board &quot;agreed to request the television authorities to refrain from any slow-motion play-back which reflected, or might reflect, adversely on any decision of the referee&quot;. As recently as 2008 FIFA president Sepp Blatter said: &quot;Let it be as it is and let&#x27;s leave [football] with errors. The television companies will have the right to say [the referee] was right or wrong, but still, the referee makes the decision – a man, not a machine.&quot; This stance was finally overturned on 3 March 2018, when the IFAB wrote video assistant referees (also known as VARs) into the Laws of the Game permanently. Their use remains optional for competitions.

In early July 2012 FIFA sanctioned the use of goal-line technology, subject to rules specified by the International Football Association Board (IFAB), who had officially approved its use by amending the Laws of the Game to permit (but not require) its use. This followed a high-profile incident during a second-round game in the 2010 FIFA World Cup between England and Germany, where a shot by Englishman Frank Lampard, which would have levelled the scores at 2–2 in a match that ultimately ended in a 4–1 German victory, crossed the line but was not seen to do so by the match officials, which led FIFA officials to declare that they would re-examine the use of goal-line technology.

=== Controversy ===
The 2015 FIFA corruption scandal exposed a widespread bribery and corruption scheme within the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the governing body of international football. This scandal implicated over two dozen FIFA officials and associates in a 24-year self-enrichment scheme that reached the highest levels of FIFA management. Accusations included bribery related to the awarding of hosting rights for the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.
On 27 May 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted 14 FIFA officials and marketing executives, charging them with receiving approximately $150 million in bribes over two decades. The scandal led to the arrest of several high-ranking FIFA officials, including vice presidents Jeffrey Webb and Eugenio Figueredo. Although FIFA president Sepp Blatter was not initially named in the criminal investigation, he resigned shortly after being re-elected for a fifth term.
Further investigations uncovered additional corruption, resulting in suspensions and bans for several FIFA executives, including Blatter, Michel Platini, and Jérôme Valcke. The scandal highlighted an organizational culture within FIFA characterized by greed, secrecy, and corruption, severely damaging its reputation and prompting widespread calls for significant reforms in the governance of international football.
On 28 February 2022, due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and by a recommendation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), FIFA suspended the participation of Russia. The Russian Football Union unsuccessfully appealed the FIFA ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which upheld the ban. Some observers, while approving of the boycott of Russia, have pointed out that FIFA did not boycott Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq as an aggressor during the Iran–Iraq War, Saudi Arabia for its military intervention in Yemen, Qatar for its human rights violations, or the United States for the actions of the US military during the Iraq War.

FIFA previously banned Indonesia due to government intervention within the team. FIFA requires members to play &quot;with no influence from third parties&quot;.

On 23 October 2024, a new controversy came up as allegations against FIFA were made by players from several countries claiming the organization did not pay them agreed sums of money. The total reaching with sums reaching up to £3m. According to reports Four hundred and twenty players did not get paid as agreed with FIFA.

==Recognition and awards==
FIFA holds an annual awards ceremony, The Best FIFA Football Awards since 2016, which recognizes both individual and team achievements in international association football. Individually, the top men&#x27;s player is awarded The Best FIFA Men&#x27;s Player, and the top women&#x27;s player is The Best FIFA Women&#x27;s Player. Other prominent awards are The Best FIFA Football Coach and FIFA FIFPRO World 11.

In 2000, FIFA presented two awards, FIFA Club of the Century and FIFA Player of the Century, to decide the greatest football club and player of the 20th century. Real Madrid was the club winner, while Diego Maradona and Pelé were the joint player&#x27;s winners.

{{Further|2015 FIFA corruption case}}
In May 2006, British investigative reporter Andrew Jennings&#x27; book &quot;Foul! The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging, and Ticket Scandals&quot; (HarperCollins) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA&#x27;s marketing partner International Sport and Leisure (ISL) and revealed how some football officials had been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had occurred in the fight for Sepp Blatter&#x27;s continued control of FIFA as the organization&#x27;s president. Shortly after the release of &quot;Foul!&quot; a BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; exposé by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke, screened on 11 June 2006, reported that Blatter was being investigated by Swiss police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than £1m worth of bribes pocketed by football officials. Lord Triesman, the former chairman of the English Football Association, described FIFA as an organization that &quot;behaves like a mafia family,&quot; highlighting the organization&#x27;s &quot;decades-long traditions of bribes, bungs, and corruption&quot;.

All testimonies offered in the &quot;Panorama&quot; exposé were provided through a disguised voice, appearance, or both, save one: Mel Brennan, a former CONCACAF official, became the first high-level football insider to go public with substantial allegations of corruption, nonfeasance, and malfeasance by CONCACAF and FIFA leadership. Brennan—the highest-level African-American in the history of world football governance—joined Jennings, Trinidadian journalist Lisana Liburd, and many others in exposing allegedly inappropriate allocations of money by CONCACAF and drew connections between ostensible CONCACAF criminality and similar behaviours at FIFA. Since then, and in the light of fresh allegations of corruption by FIFA in late 2010, both Jennings and Brennan remain highly critical of FIFA. Brennan has called directly for an alternative to FIFA to be considered by the stakeholders of the sport worldwide.

In a further &quot;Panorama&quot; exposé broadcast on 29 November 2010, Jennings alleged that three senior FIFA officials, Nicolas Leoz, Issa Hayatou and Ricardo Teixeira, had been paid huge bribes by ISL between 1989 and 1999, which FIFA had failed to investigate. Jennings claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totalling about $100 million. A former ISL executive said there were suspicions within the company that they were only awarded the marketing contract for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The program also alleged that another current official, Jack Warner, has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via &#x27;official channels.&#x27;

&quot;Panorama&quot; also alleged that FIFA requires nations bidding to host the World Cup to agree to implement special laws, including a blanket tax exemption for FIFA and its corporate sponsors and limitation of workers rights. Contrary to FIFA&#x27;s demands, these conditions were revealed by the Dutch government, resulting in them being told by FIFA that their bid could be adversely affected. Following Jennings&#x27; earlier investigations, he was banned from all FIFA press conferences for reasons he claimed had not been made clear. The accused officials failed to answer questions about his latest allegations verbally or by letter.

Prime Minister David Cameron and Andy Anson, head of England&#x27;s World Cup bid, criticized the timing of the broadcast three days before FIFA decided on the host for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, because it might damage England&#x27;s bid; the voters included officials accused by the program.

In June 2011, it came to light that the International Olympic Committee had started inquiry proceedings against FIFA honorary president João Havelange into claims of bribery. &quot;Panorama&quot; alleged that Havelange accepted a $1 million &#x27;bung&#x27; in 1997 from ISL. The IOC stated that it &quot;takes all allegations of corruption very seriously, and we would always ask for any evidence of wrongdoing involving any IOC members to be passed to our ethics commission&quot;.

In a 2014 interview, American sportswriter Dave Zirin said that corruption is endemic to FIFA leadership and that the organization should be abolished for the game&#x27;s good. He said that currently, FIFA is in charge of both monitoring corruption in association football matches and marketing and selling the sport, but that two &quot;separate&quot; organizational bodies are needed: an organizational body that monitors corruption and match-fixing and the like and an organization that&#x27;s responsible for marketing and sponsorships and selling the sport. Zirin said the idea of having a single organization responsible for both seems highly ineffective and detrimental to the sport.

In May 2015, 14 people were arrested, including nine FIFA officials, after being accused of corruption.

In the 2022 World Cup bid, Qatar was honoured to host the World Cup. Since then it has been discovered that Qatar paid as much as $200 billion to host the World Cup. This information was discovered by the Tass news agency in Russia.

===Guilty pleas===
Between 2013 and 2015 four individuals, and two sports television rights corporations pleaded guilty to United States financial misconduct charges. The pleas of Chuck Blazer, José Hawilla, Daryan Warner, Darrell Warner, Traffic Group and Traffic Sports USA were unsealed in May 2015. In another 2015 case, Singapore also imposed a 6-year &quot;harshest sentence ever received for match-fixing&quot; on match-fixer Eric Ding who had bribed three Lebanese FIFA football officials with prostitutes as an inducement to fix future matches that they would officiate, as well as perverting the course of justice.

===Indictments and arrests===
Fourteen FIFA officials and marketing executives were indicted by the United States Department of Justice in May 2015. The officials were arrested in Switzerland and are in the process of extradition to the US. Specific charges (brought under the RICO act) include wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering.

&quot;Swiss authorities say they have also opened a separate criminal investigation into FIFA&#x27;s operations pertaining to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids&quot;.

FIFA&#x27;s top officials were arrested at a hotel in Switzerland on suspicion of receiving bribes totalling $100m (£65m). The US Department of Justice stated that nine FIFA officials and four executives of sports management companies were arrested and accused of over $150m in bribes. The UK Shadow Home Secretary and Labour Member of Parliament, Andy Burnham, stated in May 2015 that England should boycott the 2018 World Cup against corruption in FIFA and military aggression by Russia.

===2018 and 2022 World Cup bids===
{{further|2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids|Garcia Report}}

FIFA&#x27;s choice to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 World Cup to Qatar has been widely criticized by media. It has been alleged that some FIFA inside sources insist that the Russian kickbacks of cash and gifts given to FIFA executive members were enough to secure the Russian 2018 bid weeks before the result was announced. Sepp Blatter was widely criticized in the media for giving a warning about the &quot;evils of the media&quot; in a speech to FIFA executive committee members shortly before they voted on the hosting of the 2018 World Cup, a reference to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; exposés, and the &quot;Panorama&quot; investigation.

Two members of FIFA&#x27;s executive committee were banned from all football-related activity in November 2010 for allegedly offering to sell their votes to undercover newspaper reporters. In early May 2011, a British parliamentary inquiry into why England failed to secure the 2018 finals was told by a member of parliament, Damian Collins, that there was evidence from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; newspaper that Issa Hayatou of Cameroon and Jacques Anouma of Ivory Coast were paid by Qatar. Qatar has categorically denied the allegations, as have Hayatou and Anouma.

FIFA president Blatter said, {{as of|2011|May|23|lc=y}}, that the British newspaper &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; has agreed to bring its whistle-blowing source to meet senior FIFA officials, who will decide whether to order a new investigation into alleged World Cup bidding corruption. &quot;[The &quot;Sunday Times&quot;] are happy, they agreed that they will bring this whistleblower here to Zürich and then we will have a discussion, an investigation of this&quot;, Blatter said.

Specifically, the whistle-blower claims that FIFA executive committee members Issa Hayatou and Jacques Anouma were paid $1.5 million to vote for Qatar. The emirate&#x27;s bid beat the United States in a final round of voting last December. Blatter did not rule out reopening the 2022 vote if corruption could be proved, but urged taking the matter &quot;step by step&quot;. The FIFA president said his organization is &quot;anxiously awaiting&quot; more evidence before asking its ethics committee to examine allegations made in Britain&#x27;s Parliament in early May 2011.

Hayatou, who is from Cameroon, leads the Confederation of African Football and is a FIFA vice-president. Anouma is president of Ivorian Football Federation. The whistle-blower said Qatar agreed to pay a third African voter, Amos Adamu, for his support. The Nigerian was later suspended from voting after a FIFA ethics court ruled he solicited bribes from undercover Sunday Times reporters posing as lobbyists. Blatter said the newspaper and its whistle-blower would meet with FIFA secretary general, Jérôme Valcke, and legal director, Marco Villiger.

Allegations against FIFA officials have also been made to the UK Parliament by David Triesman, the former head of England&#x27;s bid and the English Football Association. Triesman told the lawmakers that four long-standing FIFA executive committee members—Jack Warner, Nicolás Leoz, Ricardo Teixeira and Worawi Makudi—engaged in &quot;improper and unethical&quot; conduct in the 2018 bidding, which was won by Russia. All six FIFA voters have denied wrongdoing.

On 28 September 2015, Sepp Blatter suggested that the 2018 World Cup being awarded to Russia was planned before the voting, and that the 2022 World Cup would have then been awarded to the United States. However, this plan changed after the election ballot, and the 2022 World Cup was awarded to Qatar instead of the US.

According to leaked documents seen by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Qatari state-run television channel Al Jazeera secretly offered $400 million to FIFA, for broadcasting rights, just 21 days before FIFA announced that Qatar would hold the 2022 World Cup.

On 17 July 2012, in the wake of announced anti-corruption reforms by Sepp Blatter, the president of the FIFA, the organization appointed US lawyer Michael J. Garcia as the chairman of the investigative chamber of FIFA Ethics Committee, while German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert was appointed as the chairman of the Ethics Committee&#x27;s adjudication chamber.

In August 2012, Garcia declared his intention to investigate the bidding process and decision to respectively award the right to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup to Russia and Qatar by the FIFA Executive Committee. Garcia delivered his subsequent 350-page report in September 2014, and Eckert then announced that it would not be made public for legal reasons.

On 13 November 2014, Eckert released a 42-page summary of his findings after reviewing Garcia&#x27;s report. The summary cleared both Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing during the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, leaving Russia and Qatar free to stage their respective World Cups.

FIFA welcomed &quot;the fact that a degree of closure has been reached&quot;, while the Associated Press wrote that the Eckert summary &quot;was denounced by critics as a &quot;. Hours after the Eckert summary was released, Garcia himself criticized it for being &quot;materially incomplete&quot; with &quot;erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions&quot;, while declaring his intention to appeal to FIFA&#x27;s Appeal Committee. On 16 December 2014, FIFA&#x27;s Appeal Committee dismissed Garcia&#x27;s appeal against the Eckert summary as &quot;not admissible&quot;. FIFA also stated that Eckert&#x27;s summary was &quot;neither legally binding nor appealable&quot;. A day later, Garcia resigned from his role as FIFA ethics investigator in protest of FIFA&#x27;s conduct, citing a &quot;lack of leadership&quot; and lost confidence in the independence of Eckert from FIFA. In June 2015, Swiss authorities claimed the report was of &quot;little value&quot;.

In November 2022, the FIFA officials told players not to get involved in politics but focus on sports when they are in Qatar. A few weeks earlier, the football associations and players of Denmark and Australia criticized Qatar for this.

===2011 FIFA presidential election===
FIFA announced on 25 May 2011 that it had opened the investigation to examine the conduct of four officials—Mohamed Bin Hammam and Jack Warner, along with Caribbean Football Union (CFU) officials Debbie Minguell and Jason Sylvester—in relation to claims made by executive committee member, Chuck Blazer. Blazer, who was at the time, the general secretary of the CONCACAF confederation, has alleged that violations were committed under the FIFA code of ethics during a meeting organized by Bin Hammam and Warner on 10 and 11 May—the same time Lord Triesman had accused Warner of demanding money for a World Cup 2018 vote—in relation to the 2011 FIFA presidential election, in which Bin Hammam, who also played a key role in the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, allegedly offered financial incentives for votes cast in his favour during the presidential election.

As a result of the investigation both Bin Hammam and Warner were suspended. Warner reacted to his suspension by questioning Blatter&#x27;s conduct and adding that FIFA secretary general, Jérôme Valcke, had told him via e-mail that Qatar had bought the 2022 World Cup. Valcke subsequently issued a statement denying he had suggested it was bribery, saying instead that the country had &quot;used its financial muscle to lobby for support&quot;. Qatar officials denied any impropriety. Bin Hammam also responded by writing to FIFA, protesting unfair treatment in suspension by the FIFA Ethics Committee and FIFA administration.

Further evidence emerged of alleged corruption. On 30 May 2011, Fred Lunn, vice-president of the Bahamas Football Association, said that he was given $40,000 in cash as an incitement to vote for FIFA presidential candidate, Mohamed bin Hammam. In addition, on 11 June 2011 Louis Giskus, president of the Surinamese Football Association, alleged that he was given $40,000 in cash for &quot;development projects&quot; as an incentive to vote for Bin Hammam.

===Response to allegations===
After being re-elected as president of FIFA, Sepp Blatter responded to the allegations by promising to reform FIFA in wake of the bribery scandal, with Danny Jordaan, CEO of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, saying there is great expectation for reform. Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is being tipped for a role on the newly proposed &#x27;Solutions Committee&#x27;, and former Netherlands national football team player Johan Cruyff was also being linked with a role.

UEFA secretary-general Gianni Infantino said he hopes for &quot;concrete&quot; measures to be taken by the world game&#x27;s authority. Saying that &quot;the UEFA executive committee has taken note of the will of FIFA to take concrete and effective measures for good governance ... [and is] following the situation closely.&quot;

IOC president Jacques Rogge commented on the situation by saying that he believes FIFA &quot;can emerge stronger&quot; from its worst-ever crisis, stating that &quot;I will not point a finger and lecture ... I am sure FIFA can emerge stronger and from within&quot;.

Several of FIFA&#x27;s partners and sponsors have raised concerns about the allegations of corruption, including Coca-Cola, Adidas, Emirates and Visa. Coca-Cola raised concerns by saying &quot;the current allegations being raised are distressing and bad for the sport&quot;; with Adidas saying &quot;the negative tenor of the public debate around Fifa at the moment is neither good for football nor for Fifa and its partners&quot;; moreover Emirates raised its concerns by saying &quot;we hope that these issues will be resolved as soon as possible&quot;; and Visa adding &quot;the current situation is clearly not good for the game and we ask that Fifa take all necessary steps to resolve the concerns that have been raised.&quot;

Australian Sports Minister Mark Arbib said it was clear FIFA needed to change, saying &quot;there is no doubt there needs to be reform of FIFA. This is something that we&#x27;re hearing worldwide&quot;, with Australian Senator Nick Xenophon accusing FIFA of &quot;scamming&quot; the country out of the A$46 million (US$35 million) it spent on the Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, saying that &quot;until the investigation into FIFA has been completed, Australia must hold off spending any more taxpayers&#x27; money on any future World Cup bids.&quot;

Theo Zwanziger, president of the German Football Association, also called on FIFA to re-examine the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.

Transparency International, which had called on FIFA to postpone the election pending a full independent investigation, renewed its call on FIFA to change its governance structure.

Moreover, former Argentine football player Diego Maradona was critical of FIFA in light of the corruption scandal, comparing members of the board to dinosaurs. He said &quot;Fifa is a big museum. They are dinosaurs who do not want to relinquish power. It&#x27;s always going to be the same.&quot; In October 2011, Dick Pound criticized the organization, saying, &quot;FIFA has fallen far short of a credible demonstration that it recognizes the many problems it faces, that it has the will to solve them, that it is willing to be transparent about what it is doing and what it finds, and that its conduct in the future will be such that the public can be confident in the governance of the sport.&quot;

===2018 revision of code of ethics===
In 2018, FIFA revised its code of ethics to remove corruption as one of the enumerated bases of ethical violations. It retained bribery, misappropriation of funds and manipulation of competitions as offences, but added a statute of limitation clause that those offences could not be pursued after a ten-year period.

The revision also made it an offence to make public statements of a defamatory nature against FIFA. Alexandra Wrage, a former member of the FIFA governance committee and an expert in anti-bribery compliance, said that of the revision that &quot;the real value to FIFA is the chilling effect this will have on critics&quot;.

In October 2024 more than 100 female footballers sent an open letter to FIFA demanding the organization to end its sponsor deal with Saudi oil company Aramco, due to the continuous human rights violations, women&#x27;s rights abuses and criminalisation of homosexuality in Saudi Arabia.

<doc id="11054" wikidata="Q6223" url="?curid=11054" title="Fascism">
<text>Fascism ( ) is a far-right, authoritarian, and ultranationalist political ideology and movement, characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural social hierarchy, subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation or race, and strong regimentation of society and the economy. Opposed to anarchism, democracy, pluralism, egalitarianism, liberalism, socialism, and Marxism, fascism is at the far right of the traditional left–right spectrum.

Fascism rose to prominence in early-20th-century Europe. The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries, most notably Germany. Fascism also had adherents outside of Europe. Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. The advent of total war and the mass mobilization of society erased the distinction between civilians and combatants. A military citizenship arose, in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner. The war resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines, providing logistics to support them, and having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens.

Fascism rejects the view that violence is inherently negative or pointless but rather views imperialism, political violence, and war as means to national rejuvenation. Fascists often advocate for the establishment of a totalitarian one-party state, and for a dirigiste economy (a market economy in which the state plays a strong directive role through economic interventionist policies), with the principal goal of achieving autarky (national economic self-sufficiency). Fascism&#x27;s extreme authoritarianism and nationalism can manifest as a belief in Manifest Destiny or a revival of historical greatness (like Mussolini seeking to restore the Roman Empire). It may also centre around an ingroup-outgroup opposition. In the case of Nazism, this involved racial purity and a master race which blended with a variant of racism and discrimination against a demonized &quot;Other&quot;, such as Jews and other groups. Other marginalized groups such as homosexuals, transgender people, ethnic minorities, or immigrants have been targeted. Such bigotry has motivated fascist regimes to commit massacres, forced sterilizations, deportations, and genocides. During World War II, the genocidal and imperialist ambitions of the fascist Axis powers resulted in the murder of millions of people.

Since the end of World War II in 1945, fascism has been largely disgraced, and few parties have openly described themselves as &quot;fascist&quot;; the term is often used pejoratively by political opponents. The descriptions &quot;neo-fascist&quot; or &quot;post-fascist&quot; are sometimes applied to contemporary parties with ideologies similar to, or rooted in, 20th-century fascist movements. Some opposition groups have adopted the label anti-fascist (often shortened to antifa) to signify their stance.

==Etymology==

The Italian term is derived from , meaning &#x27;bundle of sticks&#x27;, ultimately from the Latin word . This was the name given to political organizations in Italy known as fasci, groups similar to guilds or syndicates. According to Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini&#x27;s own account, the Fasces of Revolutionary Action were founded in Italy in 1915. In 1919, Mussolini founded the Italian Fasces of Combat in Milan, which became the National Fascist Party two years later. The fascists came to associate the term with the ancient Roman fasces or , a bundle of rods tied around an axe, an ancient Roman symbol of the authority of the civic magistrate, carried by his lictors. The symbolism of the fasces suggested strength through unity: a single rod is easily broken, while the bundle is difficult to break. 

Prior to 1914, the fasces symbol was widely employed by various political movements, often of a left-wing or liberal persuasion. For instance, according to Robert Paxton, &quot;Marianne, symbol of the French Republic, was often portrayed in the nineteenth century carrying the fasces to represent the force of Republican solidarity against her aristocratic and clerical enemies.&quot; The symbol often appeared as an architectural motif, for instance on the Sheldonian Theater at Oxford University and on the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.

==Definitions==


Historian Ian Kershaw once wrote that &quot;trying to define &#x27;fascism&#x27; is like trying to nail jelly to the wall.&quot; Each group described as &quot;fascist&quot; has at least some unique elements, and frequently definitions of &quot;fascism&quot; have been criticized as either too broad or too narrow. According to many scholars, fascists—especially when they&#x27;re in power—have historically attacked communism, conservatism, and parliamentary liberalism, attracting support primarily from the far-right.

Historian Stanley G. Payne&#x27;s definition is frequently cited as standard by notable scholars, such as Roger Griffin, Randall Schweller, Bo Rothstein, Federico Finchelstein, and Stephen D. Shenfield, His definition of fascism focuses on three concepts:
# &quot;Fascist negations&quot; – anti-liberalism, anti-communism, and anti-conservatism.
# &quot;Fascist goals&quot; – the creation of a nationalist dictatorship to regulate economic structure and to transform social relations within a modern, self-determined culture, and the expansion of the nation into an empire.
# &quot;Fascist style&quot; – a political aesthetic of romantic symbolism, mass mobilization, a positive view of violence, and promotion of masculinity, youth, and charismatic authoritarian leadership.

Umberto Eco lists fourteen &quot;features that are typical of what [he] would like to call &#x27;Ur-Fascism&#x27;, or &#x27;Eternal Fascism&#x27;. These features cannot be organized into a system; many of them contradict each other, and are also typical of other kinds of despotism or fanaticism. But it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it.&quot; Historian John Lukacs argues that there is no such thing as generic fascism. He claims that Nazism and communism are essentially manifestations of populism, and that states such as Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy are more different from each other than they are similar.

In his book &quot;How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them&quot; (2018), Jason Stanley defined fascism thusly: [A] cult of the leader who promises national restoration in the face of humiliation brought on by supposed communists, Marxists and minorities and immigrants who are supposedly posing a threat to the character and the history of a nation ... The leader proposes that only he can solve it and all of his political opponents are enemies or traitors. Stanley says recent global events , including the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020–2022 United States racial unrest, have substantiated his concern about how fascist rhetoric is showing up in politics and policies around the world.

Roger Griffin describes fascism as &quot;a genus of political ideology whose mythic core in its various permutations is a palingenetic form of populist ultranationalism.&quot; Without palingenetic ultranationalism, there is no &quot;genuine fascism&quot; according to Griffin. Griffin further describes fascism as having three core components: &quot;(i) the rebirth myth, (ii) populist ultra-nationalism, and (iii) the myth of decadence.&quot; In Griffin&#x27;s view, fascism is &quot;a genuinely revolutionary, trans-class form of anti-liberal, and in the last analysis, anti-conservative nationalism&quot; built on a complex range of theoretical and cultural influences. He distinguishes an inter-war period in which it manifested itself in elite-led but populist &quot;armed party&quot; politics opposing socialism and liberalism, and promising radical politics to rescue the nation from decadence.

Kershaw argues that the difference between fascism and other forms of right-wing authoritarianism in the interwar period is that the latter generally aimed &quot;to conserve the existing social order&quot;, whereas fascism was &quot;revolutionary&quot;, seeking to change society and obtain &quot;total commitment&quot; from the population. In &quot;Against the Fascist Creep&quot;, Alexander Reid Ross writes regarding Griffin&#x27;s view: &quot;Following the Cold War and shifts in fascist organizing techniques, a number of scholars have moved toward the minimalist &#x27;new consensus&#x27; refined by Roger Griffin: &#x27;the mythic core&#x27; of fascism is &#x27;a populist form of palingenetic ultranationalism.&#x27; That means that fascism is an ideology that draws on old, ancient, and even arcane myths of racial, cultural, ethnic, and national origins to develop a plan for the &#x27;new man. Griffin himself explored this &#x27;mythic&#x27; or &#x27;eliminable&#x27; core of fascism with his concept of &quot;post-fascism&quot; to explore the continuation of Nazism in the modern era. Additionally, other historians have applied this minimalist core to explore &quot;proto-fascist&quot; movements.

Cas Mudde and Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser argue that although fascism &quot;flirted with populism ... in an attempt to generate mass support&quot;, it is better seen as an elitist ideology. They cite in particular its exaltation of the Leader, the race, and the state, rather than the people. They see populism as a &quot;thin-centered ideology&quot; with a &quot;restricted morphology&quot; that necessarily becomes attached to &quot;thick-centered&quot; ideologies such as fascism, liberalism, or socialism. Thus populism can be found as an aspect of many specific ideologies, without necessarily being a defining characteristic of those ideologies. They refer to the combination of populism, authoritarianism and ultranationalism as &quot;a marriage of convenience&quot;.

Robert Paxton says: [Fascism is] a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.

Roger Eatwell defines fascism as &quot;an ideology that strives to forge social rebirth based on a holistic-national radical Third Way&quot;, while Walter Laqueur sees the core tenets of fascism as &quot;self-evident: nationalism; social Darwinism; racialism, the need for leadership, a new aristocracy, and obedience; and the negation of the ideals of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution.&quot;

Historian Emilio Gentile has defined fascism thusly:
[A] modern political phenomenon, revolutionary, anti-liberal, and anti-Marxist, organized in a militia party with a totalitarian conception of politics and the state, an activist and anti-theoretical ideology, with a mythical, virilistic and anti-hedonistic foundation, sacralized as a secular religion, which affirms the absolute primacy of the nation, understood as an ethnically homogeneous organic community, hierarchically organized in a corporate state, with a bellicose vocation to the politics of greatness, power, and conquest aimed at creating a new order and a new civilization.

Historian and cultural critic Ruth Ben-Ghiat has described fascism as &quot;the original phase of authoritarianism, along with early communism, when a population has undergone huge dislocations or they perceive that there&#x27;s been changes in society that are very rapid, too rapid for their taste&quot;.

Racism was a key feature of German fascism, for which the Holocaust was a high priority. According to &quot;The Historiography of Genocide&quot;, &quot;In dealing with the Holocaust, it is the consensus of historians that Nazi Germany targeted Jews as a race, not as a religious group.&quot; Several historians, such as Umberto Eco, Kevin Passmore, and Moyra Grant, stress racism as a characteristic component of German fascism. Historian Robert Soucy stated that &quot;Hitler envisioned the ideal German society as a , a racially unified and hierarchically organized body in which the interests of individuals would be strictly subordinate to those of the nation, or Volk.&quot; Kershaw noted that common factors of fascism included &quot;the &#x27;cleansing&#x27; of all those deemed not to belong—foreigners, ethnic minorities, &#x27;undesirables and belief in its own nation&#x27;s superiority, even if it was not biological racism like in Nazism. Fascist philosophies vary by application, but remain distinct by one theoretical commonality: all traditionally fall into the far-right sector of any political spectrum, catalyzed by afflicted class identities over conventional social inequities.

According to the Council on Foreign Relations, many experts see fascism as a mass political movement centered around extreme nationalism, militarism, and the placement of national interests above those of the individual. Fascist regimes often advocate for the overthrow of institutions that they view as &quot;liberal decay&quot; while simultaneously promoting traditional values. They believe in the supremacy of certain peoples and use it to justify the persecution of other groups. Fascist leaders often maintain a cult of personality and seek to generate enthusiasm for the regime by rallying massive crowds. This contrasts with authoritarian governments, which also centralize power and suppress dissent, but want their subjects to remain passive and demobilized.

===Position on the political spectrum===
Scholars place fascism on the far right of the political spectrum. Such scholarship focuses on its social conservatism and its authoritarian means of opposing egalitarianism. Roderick Stackelberg places fascism—including Nazism, which he says is &quot;a radical variant of fascism&quot;—on the political right by explaining: &quot;The more a person deems absolute equality among all people to be a desirable condition, the further left he or she will be on the ideological spectrum. The more a person considers inequality to be unavoidable or even desirable, the further to the right he or she will be.&quot;

Fascism&#x27;s origins are complex and include many seemingly contradictory viewpoints, ultimately centered on a mythos of national rebirth from decadence. Fascism was founded during World War I by Italian national syndicalists who drew upon both left-wing organizational tactics and right-wing political views. Italian fascism gravitated to the right in the early 1920s. A major element of fascist ideology that has been deemed to be far right is its stated goal to promote the right of a supposedly superior people to dominate, while purging society of supposedly inferior elements.

In the 1920s, Mussolini and Giovanni Gentile described their ideology as right-wing in the political essay &quot;The Doctrine of Fascism&quot;, stating: &quot;We are free to believe that this is the century of authority, a century tending to the &#x27;right,&#x27; a fascist century.&quot; Mussolini stated that fascism&#x27;s position on the political spectrum was not a serious issue for fascists: &quot;[F]ascism, sitting on the right, could also have sat on the mountain of the center. ... These words in any case do not have a fixed and unchanged meaning: they do have a variable subject to location, time and spirit. We don&#x27;t give a damn about these empty terminologies and we despise those who are terrorized by these words.&quot;

Major Italian groups politically on the right, especially rich landowners and big business, feared an uprising by groups on the left, such as sharecroppers and labour unions. They welcomed fascism and supported its violent suppression of opponents on the left. The accommodation of the political right into the Italian Fascist movement in the early 1920s created internal factions within the movement. The &quot;fascist left&quot; included Michele Bianchi, Giuseppe Bottai, Angelo Oliviero Olivetti, Sergio Panunzio, and Edmondo Rossoni, who were committed to advancing national syndicalism as a replacement for parliamentary liberalism in order to modernize the economy and advance the interests of workers and the common people. The &quot;fascist right&quot; included members of the paramilitary Blackshirts and former members of the Italian Nationalist Association (ANI). The Blackshirts wanted to establish fascism as a complete dictatorship, while the former ANI members, including Alfredo Rocco, sought to institute an authoritarian corporatist state to replace the liberal state in Italy while retaining the existing elites. Upon accommodating the political right, there arose a group of monarchist fascists who sought to use fascism to create an absolute monarchy under King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.

A number of post-World War II fascist movements described themselves as a Third Position outside the traditional political spectrum. Falange Española de las JONS leader José Antonio Primo de Rivera said: &quot;[B]asically the Right stands for the maintenance of an economic structure, albeit an unjust one, while the Left stands for the attempt to subvert that economic structure, even though the subversion thereof would entail the destruction of much that was worthwhile.&quot;

===&quot;Fascist&quot; as a pejorative===

The term &quot;fascist&quot; has been used as a pejorative, regarding varying movements across the far right of the political spectrum. George Orwell noted in 1944 that the term had been used to denigrate diverse positions &quot;in internal politics&quot;. Orwell said that while fascism is &quot;a political and economic system&quot; that was inconvenient to define, &quot;&quot;as used&quot;, the word &#x27;Fascism&#x27; is almost entirely meaningless. ... almost any English person would accept &#x27;bully&#x27; as a synonym for &#x27;Fascist, and in 1946 wrote that Fascism&#x27; has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies something not desirable.&quot; Richard Griffiths of the University of Wales wrote in 2000 that &quot;fascism&quot; is the &quot;most misused, and over-used word, of our times&quot;. &quot;Fascist&quot; is sometimes applied to post-World War II organizations and ways of thinking that academics more commonly term &quot;neo-fascist&quot;.

Despite fascist movements&#x27; history of anti-communism, Communist states have sometimes been referred to as &quot;fascist&quot;, typically as an insult. It has been applied to Marxist–Leninist regimes in Cuba under Fidel Castro and Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh. Chinese Marxists used the term to denounce the Soviet Union during the Sino-Soviet split, and the Soviets used the term to denounce Chinese Marxists, in addition to social democracy, coining a new term in &quot;social fascism&quot;. In the United States, Herbert Matthews of &quot;The New York Times&quot; asked in 1946: &quot;Should we now place Stalinist Russia in the same category as Hitlerite Germany? Should we say that she is Fascist?&quot; J. Edgar Hoover, longtime FBI director and ardent anti-communist, wrote extensively of red fascism. The Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s was sometimes called &quot;fascist&quot;. Historian Peter Amann states that, &quot;Undeniably, the Klan had some traits in common with European fascism—chauvinism, racism, a mystique of violence, an affirmation of a certain kind of archaic traditionalism—yet their differences were fundamental ... [the KKK] never envisioned a change of political or economic system.&quot;

==History==
===Background and 19th-century roots===
Early influences that shaped the ideology of fascism have been dated back to ancient Greece. The political culture of ancient Greece and specifically the ancient Greek city state of Sparta under Lycurgus, with its emphasis on militarism and racial purity, were admired by the Nazis. Nazi &quot;Führer&quot; Adolf Hitler emphasized that Germany should adhere to Hellenic values and culture – particularly that of ancient Sparta.

Georges Valois, founder of the first non-Italian fascist party Faisceau, claimed the roots of fascism stemmed from the late 18th century Jacobin movement, seeing in its totalitarian nature a foreshadowing of the fascist state. Historian George Mosse similarly analyzed fascism as an inheritor of the mass ideology and civil religion of the French Revolution, as well as a result of the brutalization of societies in 1914–1918.

Historians such as Irene Collins and Howard C Payne see Napoleon III, who ran a &#x27;police state&#x27; and suppressed the media, as a forerunner of fascism. According to David Thomson, the Italian Risorgimento of 1871 led to the &#x27;nemesis of fascism&#x27;. William L Shirer sees a continuity from the views of Fichte and Hegel, through Bismarck, to Hitler; Robert Gerwarth speaks of a &#x27;direct line&#x27; from Bismarck to Hitler. Julian Dierkes sees fascism as a &#x27;particularly violent form of imperialism&#x27;.

Marcus Garvey, founder and leader of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, insisted that he and his organisation &quot;were the first fascists&quot;. In 1938, C. L. R. James wrote &quot;all the things that Hitler was to do so well later, Marcus Garvey was doing in 1920 and 1921&quot;.

=== era and fusion of Maurrasism with Sorelianism (1880–1914)===

The historian Zeev Sternhell has traced the ideological roots of fascism back to the 1880s and in particular to the theme of that time. The theme was based on a revolt against materialism, rationalism, positivism, bourgeois society, and democracy. The generation supported emotionalism, irrationalism, subjectivism, and vitalism. They regarded civilization as being in crisis, requiring a massive and total solution. Their intellectual school considered the individual as only one part of the larger collectivity, which should not be viewed as a numerical sum of atomized individuals. They condemned the rationalistic, liberal individualism of society and the dissolution of social links in bourgeois society.

The outlook was influenced by various intellectual developments, including Darwinian biology, , Arthur de Gobineau&#x27;s racialism, Gustave Le Bon&#x27;s psychology, and the philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and Henri Bergson. Social Darwinism, which gained widespread acceptance, made no distinction between physical and social life, and viewed the human condition as being an unceasing struggle to achieve the survival of the fittest. It challenged positivism&#x27;s claim of deliberate and rational choice as the determining behaviour of humans, with social Darwinism focusing on heredity, race, and environment. Its emphasis on biogroup identity and the role of organic relations within societies fostered the legitimacy and appeal of nationalism. New theories of social and political psychology also rejected the notion of human behaviour being governed by rational choice and instead claimed that emotion was more influential in political issues than reason. Nietzsche&#x27;s argument that &quot;God is dead&quot; coincided with his attack on the &quot;herd mentality&quot; of Christianity, democracy, and modern collectivism, his concept of the , and his advocacy of the will to power as a primordial instinct, were major influences upon many of the generation. Bergson&#x27;s claim of the existence of an , or vital instinct, centred upon free choice and rejected the processes of materialism and determinism; this challenged Marxism.

In his work &quot;The Ruling Class&quot; (1896), Gaetano Mosca developed the theory that claims that in all societies an &quot;organized minority&quot; would dominate and rule over an &quot;disorganized majority&quot;, stating that there are only two classes in society, &quot;the governing&quot; (the organized minority) and &quot;the governed&quot; (the disorganized majority). He claims that the organized nature of the organized minority makes it irresistible to any individual of the disorganized majority.

French nationalist and reactionary monarchist Charles Maurras influenced fascism. Maurras promoted what he called integral nationalism, which called for the organic unity of a nation, and insisted that a powerful monarch was an ideal leader of a nation. Maurras distrusted what he considered the democratic mystification of the popular will that created an impersonal collective subject. He claimed that a powerful monarch was a personified sovereign who could exercise authority to unite a nation&#x27;s people. Maurras&#x27; integral nationalism was idealized by fascists, but modified into a modernized revolutionary form that was devoid of Maurras&#x27; monarchism.

====Fascist syndicalism====

French revolutionary syndicalist Georges Sorel promoted the legitimacy of political violence in his work &quot;Reflections on Violence&quot; (1908) and other works in which he advocated radical syndicalist action to achieve a revolution to overthrow capitalism and the bourgeoisie through a general strike. In &quot;Reflections on Violence&quot;, Sorel emphasized need for a revolutionary political religion. Also in his work &quot;The Illusions of Progress&quot;, Sorel denounced democracy as reactionary, saying &quot;nothing is more aristocratic than democracy.&quot; By 1909, after the failure of a syndicalist general strike in France, Sorel and his supporters left the radical left and went to the radical right, where they sought to merge militant Catholicism and French patriotism with their views—advocating anti-republican Christian French patriots as ideal revolutionaries. Initially, Sorel had officially been a revisionist of Marxism, but by 1910 announced his abandonment of socialist literature and claimed in 1914, using an aphorism of Benedetto Croce that &quot;socialism is dead&quot; because of the &quot;decomposition of Marxism&quot;. Sorel became a supporter of reactionary Maurrassian nationalism beginning in 1909 that influenced his works. Maurras held interest in merging his nationalist ideals with Sorelian syndicalism, known as Sorelianism, as a means to confront democracy. Maurras stated that &quot;a socialism liberated from the democratic and cosmopolitan element fits nationalism well as a well made glove fits a beautiful hand.&quot;

The fusion of Maurrassian nationalism and Sorelian syndicalism influenced radical Italian nationalist Enrico Corradini. Corradini spoke of the need for a nationalist-syndicalist movement, led by elitist aristocrats and anti-democrats who shared a revolutionary syndicalist commitment to direct action and a willingness to fight. Corradini spoke of Italy as being a &quot;proletarian nation&quot; that needed to pursue imperialism in order to challenge the &quot;plutocratic&quot; French and British. Corradini&#x27;s views were part of a wider set of perceptions within the right-wing Italian Nationalist Association (ANI), which claimed that Italy&#x27;s economic backwardness was caused by corruption in its political class, liberalism, and division caused by &quot;ignoble socialism&quot;.

The ANI held ties and influence among conservatives, Catholics, and the business community. Italian national syndicalists held a common set of principles: the rejection of bourgeois values, democracy, liberalism, Marxism, internationalism, and pacifism, and the promotion of heroism, vitalism, and violence. The ANI claimed that liberal democracy was no longer compatible with the modern world, and advocated a strong state and imperialism. They believed that humans are naturally predatory, and that nations are in a constant struggle in which only the strongest would survive.

Futurism was both an artistic-cultural movement and initially a political movement in Italy led by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti who founded the Manifesto of Futurism (1908), that championed the causes of modernism, action, and political violence as necessary elements of politics while denouncing liberalism and parliamentary politics. Marinetti rejected conventional democracy based on majority rule and egalitarianism, for a new form of democracy, promoting what he described in his work &quot;The Futurist Conception of Democracy&quot; as the following: &quot;We are therefore able to give the directions to create and to dismantle to numbers, to quantity, to the mass, for with us number, quantity and mass will never be—as they are in Germany and Russia—the number, quantity and mass of mediocre men, incapable and indecisive.&quot;

Futurism influenced fascism in its emphasis on recognizing the virile nature of violent action and war as being necessities of modern civilization. Marinetti promoted the need of physical training of young men saying that, in male education, gymnastics should take precedence over books. He advocated segregation of the genders because womanly sensibility must not enter men&#x27;s education, which he claimed must be &quot;lively, bellicose, muscular and violently dynamic.&quot;

===World War I and its aftermath (1914–1929)===

At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Italian political left became severely split over its position on the war. The Italian Socialist Party (PSI) opposed the war but a number of Italian revolutionary syndicalists supported war against Germany and Austria-Hungary on the grounds that their reactionary regimes had to be defeated to ensure the success of socialism. Angelo Oliviero Olivetti formed a pro-interventionist &quot;fascio&quot; called the Revolutionary Fasces of International Action in October 1914. Benito Mussolini upon being expelled from his position as chief editor of the PSI&#x27;s newspaper for his anti-German stance, joined the interventionist cause in a separate &quot;fascio&quot;. The term &quot;fascism&quot; was first used in 1915 by members of Mussolini&#x27;s movement, the Fasces of Revolutionary Action.

The first meeting of the Fasces of Revolutionary Action was held on 24 January 1915 when Mussolini declared that it was necessary for Europe to resolve its national problems—including national borders—of Italy and elsewhere &quot;for the ideals of justice and liberty for which oppressed peoples must acquire the right to belong to those national communities from which they descended.&quot; Attempts to hold mass meetings were ineffective and the organization was regularly harassed by government authorities and socialists.
Similar political ideas arose in Germany after the outbreak of the war. German sociologist Johann Plenge spoke of the rise of a &quot;National Socialism&quot; in Germany within what he termed the &quot;ideas of 1914&quot; that were a declaration of war against the &quot;ideas of 1789&quot; (the French Revolution). According to Plenge, the &quot;ideas of 1789&quot;—such as the rights of man, democracy, individualism and liberalism—were being rejected in favor of &quot;the ideas of 1914&quot; that included &quot;German values&quot; of duty, discipline, law and order. Plenge believed that racial solidarity () would replace class division and that &quot;racial comrades&quot; would unite to create a socialist society in the struggle of &quot;proletarian&quot; Germany against &quot;capitalist&quot; Britain. He believed that the Spirit of 1914 manifested itself in the concept of the People&#x27;s League of National Socialism. This National Socialism was a form of state socialism that rejected the &quot;idea of boundless freedom&quot; and promoted an economy that would serve the whole of Germany under the leadership of the state. This National Socialism was opposed to capitalism because of the components that were against &quot;the national interest&quot; of Germany but insisted that National Socialism would strive for greater efficiency in the economy. Plenge advocated an authoritarian rational ruling elite to develop National Socialism through a hierarchical technocratic state.

====Impact of World War I====
Fascists viewed World War I as bringing revolutionary changes in the nature of war, society, the state and technology, as the advent of total war and mass mobilization had broken down the distinction between civilian and combatant, as civilians had become a critical part in economic production for the war effort and thus arose a &quot;military citizenship&quot; in which all citizens were involved to the military in some manner during the war. World War I had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines or provide economic production and logistics to support those on the front lines, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens. Fascists viewed technological developments of weaponry and the state&#x27;s total mobilization of its population in the war as symbolizing the beginning of a new era fusing state power with mass politics, technology and particularly the mobilizing myth that they contended had triumphed over the myth of progress and the era of liberalism.

====Impact of the Bolshevik Revolution====
The October Revolution of 1917, in which Bolshevik communists led by Vladimir Lenin seized power in Russia, greatly influenced the development of fascism. Leon Trotsky would later formulate a theory of fascism based on a dialectical interpretation of events to analyze the manifestation of Italian fascism and the early emergence of Nazi Germany from 1930 to 1933. In 1917, Mussolini, as leader of the Fasces of Revolutionary Action, praised the October Revolution, but later he became unimpressed with Lenin, regarding him as merely a new version of Tsar Nicholas II. After World War I, fascists commonly campaigned on anti-Marxist agendas.

British historian Cyprian Blamires argues that there are similarities between fascism and Bolshevism, including that they believed in the necessity of a vanguard leadership, showed contempt for bourgeois values, and had totalitarian ambitions. In practice, both have commonly emphasized revolutionary action, proletarian nation theories, one-party states, and party-armies; however, both draw clear distinctions from each other both in aims and tactics, with the Bolsheviks emphasizing the need for an organized participatory democracy (Soviet democracy) and an egalitarian, internationalist vision for society based on proletarian internationalism, while fascists emphasized hyper-nationalism and open hostility towards democracy, envisioning a hierarchical social structure as essential to their aims. With the antagonism between anti-interventionist Marxists and pro-interventionist fascists complete by the end of the war, the two sides became irreconcilable. The fascists presented themselves as anti-communists and as especially opposed to the Marxists. In 1919, Mussolini consolidated control over the fascist movement, known as , with the founding of the &quot;Italian Fasces of Combat&quot;.

====Fascist Manifesto and Charter of Carnaro====
In 1919, Alceste De Ambris and futurist movement leader Filippo Tommaso Marinetti created &quot;The Manifesto of the Italian Fasces of Combat&quot;. The Fascist Manifesto was presented on 6 June 1919 in the fascist newspaper and supported the creation of universal suffrage, including women&#x27;s suffrage (the latter being realized only partly in late 1925, with all opposition parties banned or disbanded); proportional representation on a regional basis; government representation through a corporatist system of &quot;National Councils&quot; of experts, selected from professionals and tradespeople, elected to represent and hold legislative power over their respective areas, including labour, industry, transportation, public health, and communications, among others; and abolition of the Senate of the Kingdom of Italy. The Fascist Manifesto supported the creation of an eight-hour work day for all workers, a minimum wage, worker representation in industrial management, equal confidence in labour unions as in industrial executives and public servants, reorganization of the transportation sector, revision of the draft law on invalidity insurance, reduction of the retirement age from 65 to 55, a strong progressive tax on capital, confiscation of the property of religious institutions and abolishment of bishoprics, and revision of military contracts to allow the government to seize 85% of profits. It also called for the fulfillment of expansionist aims in the Balkans and other parts of the Mediterranean, the creation of a short-service national militia to serve defensive duties, nationalization of the armaments industry, and a foreign policy designed to be peaceful but also competitive.
The next events that influenced the fascists in Italy were the raid of Fiume by Italian nationalist Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio and the founding of the Charter of Carnaro in 1920. D&#x27;Annunzio and De Ambris designed the Charter, which advocated national-syndicalist corporatist productionism alongside D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s political views. Many fascists saw the Charter of Carnaro as an ideal constitution for a fascist Italy. This behaviour of aggression towards Yugoslavia and South Slavs was pursued by Italian fascists with their persecution of South Slavs—especially Slovenes and Croats.

====From populism to conservative accommodations====
In 1920, militant strike activity by industrial workers reached its peak in Italy and 1919 and 1920 were known as the &quot;Red Year&quot; (). Mussolini and the fascists took advantage of the situation by allying with industrial businesses and attacking workers and peasants in the name of preserving order and internal peace in Italy.

Fascists identified their primary opponents as the majority of socialists on the left who had opposed intervention in World War I. The fascists and the Italian political right held common ground: both held Marxism in contempt, discounted class consciousness and believed in the rule of elites. The fascists assisted the anti-socialist campaign by allying with the other parties and the conservative right in a mutual effort to destroy the Italian Socialist Party and labour organizations committed to class identity above national identity.

Fascism sought to accommodate Italian conservatives by making major alterations to its political agenda—abandoning its previous populism, republicanism and anticlericalism, adopting policies in support of free enterprise and accepting the Catholic Church and the monarchy as institutions in Italy. To appeal to Italian conservatives, fascism adopted policies such as promoting family values, including policies designed to reduce the number of women in the workforce—limiting the woman&#x27;s role to that of a mother. The fascists banned literature on birth control and increased penalties for abortion in 1926, declaring both crimes against the state.

Although fascism adopted a number of anti-modern positions designed to appeal to people upset with the new trends in sexuality and women&#x27;s rights—especially those with a reactionary point of view—the fascists sought to maintain fascism&#x27;s revolutionary character, with Angelo Oliviero Olivetti saying: &quot;Fascism would like to be conservative, but it will [be] by being revolutionary.&quot; The Fascists supported revolutionary action and committed to secure law and order to appeal to both conservatives and syndicalists.

Prior to fascism&#x27;s accommodations to the political right, fascism was a small, urban, northern Italian movement that had about a thousand members. After Fascism&#x27;s accommodation of the political right, the fascist movement&#x27;s membership soared to approximately 250,000 by 1921. A 2020 article by Daron Acemoğlu, Giuseppe De Feo, Giacomo De Luca, and Gianluca Russo in the Center for Economic and Policy Research, exploring the link between the threat of socialism and Mussolini&#x27;s rise to power, found &quot;a strong association between the Red Scare in Italy and the subsequent local support for the Fascist Party in the early 1920s.&quot; According to the authors, it was local elites and large landowners who played an important role in boosting Fascist Party activity and support, which did not come from socialists&#x27; core supporters but from centre-right voters, as they viewed traditional centre-right parties as ineffective in stopping socialism and turned to the Fascists. In 2003, historian Adrian Lyttelton wrote: &quot;The expansion of Fascism in the rural areas was stimulated and directed by the reaction of the farmers and landowners against the peasant leagues of both Socialists and Catholics.&quot;

====Fascist violence====
Beginning in 1922, fascist paramilitaries escalated their strategy from one of attacking socialist offices and the homes of socialist leadership figures, to one of violent occupation of cities. The fascists met little serious resistance from authorities and proceeded to take over several northern Italian cities. The fascists attacked the headquarters of socialist and Catholic labour unions in Cremona and imposed forced Italianization upon the German-speaking population of Bolzano. After seizing these cities, the fascists made plans to take Rome.

On 24 October 1922, the Fascist Party held its annual congress in Naples, where Mussolini ordered Blackshirts to take control of public buildings and trains and to converge on three points around Rome. The Fascists managed to seize control of several post offices and trains in northern Italy while the Italian government, led by a left-wing coalition, was internally divided and unable to respond to the Fascist advances. King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy perceived the risk of bloodshed in Rome in response to attempting to disperse the Fascists to be too high. Victor Emmanuel III decided to appoint Mussolini as Prime Minister of Italy and Mussolini arrived in Rome on 30 October to accept the appointment. Fascist propaganda aggrandized this event, known as &quot;March on Rome&quot;, as a &quot;seizure&quot; of power because of Fascists&#x27; heroic exploits.

===Fascist Italy===
Historian Stanley G. Payne says:

[Fascism in Italy was a] primarily political dictatorship. ... The Fascist Party itself had become almost completely bureaucratized and subservient to, not dominant over, the state itself. Big business, industry, and finance retained extensive autonomy, particularly in the early years. The armed forces also enjoyed considerable autonomy. ... The Fascist militia was placed under military control. ... The judicial system was left largely intact and relatively autonomous as well. The police continued to be directed by state officials and were not taken over by party leaders ... nor was a major new police elite created. ... There was never any question of bringing the Church under overall subservience. ... Sizable sectors of Italian cultural life retained extensive autonomy, and no major state propaganda-and-culture ministry existed. ... The Mussolini regime was neither especially sanguinary nor particularly repressive.

====Mussolini in power====

Upon being appointed Prime Minister of Italy, Mussolini had to form a coalition government because the fascists did not have control over the Italian parliament. Mussolini&#x27;s coalition government initially pursued economically liberal policies under the direction of liberal finance minister Alberto De Stefani, a member of the Center Party, including balancing the budget through deep cuts to the civil service. Initially, little drastic change in government policy had occurred and repressive police actions were limited.

The fascists began their attempt to entrench fascism in Italy with the Acerbo Law, which guaranteed a plurality of the seats in parliament to any party or coalition list in an election that received 25% or more of the vote. Through considerable fascist violence and intimidation, the list won a majority of the vote, allowing many seats to go to the fascists. In the aftermath of the election, a crisis and political scandal erupted after Socialist Party deputy Giacomo Matteotti was kidnapped and murdered by a Fascist. The liberals and the leftist minority in parliament walked out in protest in what became known as the Aventine Secession. On 3 January 1925, Mussolini addressed the Fascist-dominated Italian parliament and declared that he was personally responsible for what happened, but insisted that he had done nothing wrong. Mussolini proclaimed himself dictator of Italy, assuming full responsibility over the government and announcing the dismissal of parliament. From 1925 to 1929, fascism steadily became entrenched in power: opposition deputies were denied access to parliament, censorship was introduced and a December 1925 decree made Mussolini solely responsible to the King.

====Catholic Church====
In 1929, the fascist regime briefly gained what was in effect a blessing of the Catholic Church after the regime signed a concordat with the Church, known as the Lateran Treaty, which gave the papacy state sovereignty and financial compensation for the seizure of Church lands by the liberal state in the 19th century, but within two years the Church had renounced fascism in the Encyclical &quot;Non Abbiamo Bisogno&quot; as a &quot;pagan idolatry of the state&quot; which teaches &quot;hatred, violence and irreverence&quot;. Not long after signing the agreement, by Mussolini&#x27;s own confession, the Church had threatened to have him &quot;excommunicated&quot;, in part because of his intractable nature, but also because he had &quot;confiscated more issues of Catholic newspapers in the next three months than in the previous seven years.&quot; By the late 1930s, Mussolini became more vocal in his anti-clerical rhetoric, repeatedly denouncing the Catholic Church and discussing ways to depose the pope. He took the position that the &quot;papacy was a malignant tumor in the body of Italy and must &#x27;be rooted out once and for all,&#x27; because there was no room in Rome for both the Pope and himself.&quot; In her 1974 book, Mussolini&#x27;s widow Rachele stated that her husband had always been an atheist until near the end of his life, writing that her husband was &quot;basically irreligious until the later years of his life.&quot;

The Nazis in Germany employed similar anti-clerical policies. The Gestapo confiscated hundreds of monasteries in Austria and Germany, evicted clergymen and laymen alike and often replaced crosses with swastikas. Referring to the swastika as &quot;the Devil&#x27;s Cross&quot;, church leaders found their youth organizations banned, their meetings limited and various Catholic periodicals censored or banned. Government officials eventually found it necessary to place &quot;Nazis into editorial positions in the Catholic press.&quot; Up to 2,720 clerics, mostly Catholics, were arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned inside of Germany&#x27;s Dachau concentration camp, resulting in over 1,000 deaths.

====Corporatist economic system====
The fascist regime created a corporatist economic system in 1925 with creation of the Palazzo Vidoni Pact, in which the Italian employers&#x27; association Confindustria and fascist trade unions agreed to recognize each other as the sole representatives of Italy&#x27;s employers and employees, excluding non-fascist trade unions. The Fascist regime first created a Ministry of Corporations that organized the Italian economy into 22 sectoral corporations, banned workers&#x27; strikes and lock-outs and in 1927 created the Charter of Labour, which established workers&#x27; rights and duties and created labour tribunals to arbitrate employer-employee disputes. In practice, the sectoral corporations exercised little independence and were largely controlled by the regime, and the employee organizations were rarely led by employees themselves, but instead by appointed Fascist party members.

====Aggressive foreign policy====
In the 1920s, Fascist Italy pursued an aggressive foreign policy that included ambitions to expand Italian territory. In response to revolt in the Italian colony of Libya, Fascist Italy abandoned previous liberal-era colonial policy of cooperation with local leaders. Instead, claiming that Italians were a superior race to African races and thereby had the right to colonize the &quot;inferior&quot; Africans, it sought to settle 10 to 15 million Italians in Libya. This resulted in an aggressive military campaign known as the Pacification of Libya against natives in Libya, including mass killings, the use of concentration camps and the forced starvation of thousands of people. Italian authorities committed ethnic cleansing by forcibly expelling 100,000 Bedouin Cyrenaicans, half the population of Cyrenaica in Libya, from their settlements that was slated to be given to Italian settlers.

====Nazi adoption of the Italian model====

The March on Rome brought fascism international attention. One early admirer of the Italian fascists was Adolf Hitler, who less than a month after the March had begun to model himself and the Nazi Party upon Mussolini and the Fascists. The Nazis, led by Hitler and the German war hero Erich Ludendorff, attempted a &quot;March on Berlin&quot; modeled upon the March on Rome, which resulted in the failed Beer Hall Putsch in Munich in November 1923.

===International impact of the Great Depression and buildup to World War II===
The conditions of economic hardship caused by the Great Depression brought about an international surge of social unrest. Fascist propaganda blamed the problems of the long depression of the 1930s on minorities and scapegoats: &quot;Judeo-Masonic-bolshevik&quot; conspiracies, left-wing internationalism and the presence of immigrants.

In Germany, it contributed to the rise of the Nazi Party, which resulted in the demise of the Weimar Republic and the establishment of the fascist regime, Nazi Germany, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. With the rise of Hitler and the Nazis to power in 1933, liberal democracy was dissolved in Germany and the Nazis mobilized the country for war, with expansionist territorial aims against several countries. In the 1930s, the Nazis implemented racial laws that deliberately discriminated against, disenfranchised and persecuted Jews and other racial and minority groups.

Fascist movements grew in strength elsewhere in Europe. Hungarian fascist Gyula Gömbös rose to power as Prime Minister of Hungary in 1932 and attempted to entrench his Party of National Unity throughout the country. He created an eight-hour work day and a forty-eight-hour work week in industry; sought to entrench a corporatist economy; and pursued irredentist claims on Hungary&#x27;s neighbors. The fascist Iron Guard movement in Romania soared in political support after 1933, gaining representation in the Romanian government, and an Iron Guard member assassinated Romanian prime minister Ion Duca. The Iron Guard was the only fascist movement outside Germany and Italy to come to power without foreign assistance. During the 6 February 1934 crisis, France faced the greatest domestic political turmoil since the Dreyfus Affair when the fascist Francist Movement and multiple far-right movements rioted &quot;en masse&quot; in Paris against the French government resulting in major political violence. A variety of para-fascist governments that borrowed elements from fascism were formed during the Great Depression, including those of Greece, Lithuania, Poland and Yugoslavia. In the Netherlands, the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands was at its height in the 1930s due to the Great Depression, especially in 1935 when it won almost eight percent of votes, until the year 1937.

In the Americas, the Brazilian Integralists led by Plínio Salgado claimed as many as 200,000 members, although following coup attempts it faced a crackdown from the Estado Novo of Getúlio Vargas in 1937. In Peru, the fascist Revolutionary Union was a fascist political party which was in power 1931 to 1933. In the 1930s, the National Socialist Movement of Chile gained seats in Chile&#x27;s parliament and attempted a coup d&#x27;état that resulted in the Seguro Obrero massacre of 1938.

During the Great Depression, Mussolini promoted active state intervention in the economy. He denounced the contemporary &quot;supercapitalism&quot; that he claimed began in 1914 as a failure because of its alleged decadence, its support for unlimited consumerism, and its intention to create the &quot;standardization of humankind.&quot; Fascist Italy created the Institute for Industrial Reconstruction (IRI), a giant state-owned firm and holding company that provided state funding to failing private enterprises. The IRI was made a permanent institution in Fascist Italy in 1937, pursued fascist policies to create national autarky and had the power to take over private firms to maximize war production. While Hitler&#x27;s regime only nationalized 500 companies in key industries by the early 1940s, Mussolini declared in 1934 that &quot;[t]hree-fourths of Italian economy, industrial and agricultural, is in the hands of the state.&quot;

Due to the worldwide depression, Mussolini&#x27;s government was able to take over most of Italy&#x27;s largest failing banks, who held controlling interest in many Italian businesses. The Institute for Industrial Reconstruction, a state-operated holding company in charge of bankrupt banks and companies, reported in early 1934 that they held assets of &quot;48.5 percent of the share capital of Italy&quot;, which later included the capital of the banks themselves. Political historian Martin Blinkhorn estimated Italy&#x27;s scope of state intervention and ownership &quot;greatly surpassed that in Nazi Germany, giving Italy a public sector second only to that of Stalin&#x27;s Russia.&quot; In the late 1930s, Italy enacted manufacturing cartels, tariff barriers, currency restrictions and massive regulation of the economy to attempt to balance payments. Italy&#x27;s policy of autarky failed to achieve effective economic autonomy. Nazi Germany similarly pursued an economic agenda with the aims of autarky and rearmament and imposed protectionist policies, including forcing the German steel industry to use lower-quality German iron ore rather than superior-quality imported iron.

===World War II (1939–1945)===
In Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, both Mussolini and Hitler pursued territorial expansionist and interventionist foreign policy agendas from the 1930s through the 1940s culminating in World War II. From 1935 to 1939, Germany and Italy escalated their demands for territorial claims and greater influence in world affairs. Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935 resulting in its condemnation by the League of Nations and its widespread diplomatic isolation. In 1936, Germany remilitarized the industrial Rhineland, a region that had been ordered demilitarized by the Treaty of Versailles. In 1938, Germany annexed Austria and Italy assisted Germany in resolving the diplomatic crisis between Germany versus Britain and France over claims on Czechoslovakia by arranging the Munich Agreement that gave Germany the Sudetenland and was perceived at the time to have averted a European war. These hopes faded when Czechoslovakia was dissolved by the proclamation of the German client state of Slovakia, followed by the next day of the occupation of the remaining Czech Lands and the proclamation of the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. At the same time from 1938 to 1939, Italy was demanding territorial and colonial concessions from France and Britain. In 1939, Germany prepared for war with Poland, but attempted to gain territorial concessions from Poland through diplomatic means. The Polish government did not trust Hitler&#x27;s promises and refused to accept Germany&#x27;s demands.

The invasion of Poland by Germany was deemed unacceptable by Britain, France and their allies, leading to their mutual declaration of war against Germany and the start of World War II. In 1940, Mussolini led Italy into World War II on the side of the Axis. During World War II, the Axis Powers in Europe led by Nazi Germany participated in the extermination of millions of Poles, Jews, Gypsies and others in the genocide known as the Holocaust. In 1943, after Italy faced multiple military failures, the complete reliance and subordination of Italy to Germany, the Allied invasion of Italy and the corresponding international humiliation, Mussolini was removed as head of government and arrested on the order of King Victor Emmanuel III, who proceeded to dismantle the Fascist state and declared Italy&#x27;s switching of allegiance to the Allied side. Mussolini was rescued from arrest by German forces and led the German client state, the Italian Social Republic from 1943 to 1945. Nazi Germany faced multiple losses and steady Soviet and Western Allied offensives from 1943 to 1945.

On 28 April 1945, Mussolini was captured and executed by Italian communist partisans. On 30 April 1945, Hitler committed suicide. Shortly afterwards, Germany surrendered and the Nazi regime was systematically dismantled by the occupying Allied powers. An International Military Tribunal was subsequently convened in Nuremberg. Beginning in November 1945 and lasting through 1949, numerous Nazi political, military and economic leaders were tried and convicted of war crimes, with many of the worst offenders being sentenced to death and executed.

===Post-World War II (1945–2008)===

The victory of the Allies over the Axis powers in World War II led to the collapse of many fascist regimes in Europe. The Nuremberg Trials convicted several Nazi leaders of crimes against humanity involving the Holocaust. However, there remained several movements and governments that were ideologically related to fascism.

Francisco Franco&#x27;s Falangist one-party state in Spain was officially neutral during World War II, although Franco&#x27;s rise to power had been directly assisted by the militaries of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany during the Spanish Civil War. The first years were characterized by a repression against the anti-fascist ideologies, deep censorship and the suppression of democratic institutions (elected Parliament, Spanish Constitution of 1931, Regional Statutes of Autonomy). After World War II and a period of international isolation, Franco&#x27;s regime normalized relations with the Western powers during the Cold War, until Franco&#x27;s death in 1975 and the transformation of Spain into a liberal democracy.

Historian Robert Paxton observes that one of the main problems in defining fascism is that it was widely mimicked. Paxton says: &quot;In fascism&#x27;s heyday, in the 1930s, many regimes that were not functionally fascist borrowed elements of fascist decor in order to lend themselves an aura of force, vitality, and mass mobilization.&quot; He goes on to observe that Salazar &quot;crushed Portuguese fascism after he had copied some of its techniques of popular mobilization.&quot; Paxton says: &quot;Where Franco subjected Spain&#x27;s fascist party to his personal control, Salazar abolished outright in July 1934 the nearest thing Portugal had to an authentic fascist movement, Rolão Preto&#x27;s blue-shirted National Syndicalists. ... Salazar preferred to control his population through such &#x27;organic&#x27; institutions traditionally powerful in Portugal as the Church. Salazar&#x27;s regime was not only non-fascist, but &#x27;voluntarily non-totalitarian,&#x27; preferring to let those of its citizens who kept out of politics &#x27;live by habit. However, historians tend to view the Estado Novo as para-fascist in nature, possessing minimal fascist tendencies. Other historians, including Fernando Rosas and Manuel Villaverde Cabral, think that the Estado Novo should be considered fascist.

The term neo-fascism refers to fascist movements after World War II. In Italy, the Italian Social Movement led by Giorgio Almirante was a major neo-fascist movement that transformed itself into a self-described &quot;post-fascist&quot; movement called the National Alliance (AN), which has been an ally of Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s Forza Italia for a decade. In 2008, AN joined Forza Italia in Berlusconi&#x27;s new party The People of Freedom, but in 2012 a group of politicians split from The People of Freedom, refounding the party with the name Brothers of Italy. In Germany, various neo-Nazi movements have been formed and banned in accordance with Germany&#x27;s constitutional law which forbids Nazism. The National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) is widely considered a neo-Nazi party, although the party does not publicly identify itself as such.

In Argentina, Peronism, associated with the regime of Juan Perón from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974, was influenced by fascism. Between 1939 and 1941, prior to his rise to power, Perón had developed a deep admiration of Italian Fascism and modelled his economic policies on Italian fascist policies. However, not all historians agree with this identification, which they consider debatable or even false, biased by a pejorative political position. Other authors, such as the Israeli Raanan Rein, categorically maintain that Perón was not a fascist and that this characterization was imposed on him because of his defiant stance against US hegemony.

===Contemporary fascism (2008–present)===
====Greece====

After the onset of the Great Recession and economic crisis in Greece, a movement known as the Golden Dawn, widely considered a neo-Nazi party, soared in support out of obscurity and won seats in Greece&#x27;s parliament, espousing a staunch hostility towards minorities, illegal immigrants and refugees. In 2013, after the murder of an anti-fascist musician by a person with links to Golden Dawn, the Greek government ordered the arrest of Golden Dawn&#x27;s leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos and other members on charges related to being associated with a criminal organization. On 7 October 2020, Athens Appeals Court announced verdicts for 68 defendants, including the party&#x27;s political leadership. Nikolaos Michaloliakos and six other prominent members and former members of parliament (MPs) were found guilty of running a criminal organization. Guilty verdicts were delivered on charges of murder, attempted murder, and violent attacks on immigrants and left-wing political opponents.

====Post-Soviet Russia====
Marlene Laruelle, a French political scientist, contends in &quot;Is Russia Fascist?&quot; that the accusation of &quot;fascist&quot; has evolved into a strategic narrative of the existing world order. Geopolitical rivals might construct their own view of the world and assert the moral high ground by branding ideological rivals as fascists, regardless of their real ideals or deeds. Laruelle discusses the basis, significance, and veracity of accusations of fascism in and around Russia through an analysis of the domestic situation in Russia and the Kremlin&#x27;s foreign policy justifications; she concludes that Russian efforts to brand its opponents as fascist is ultimately an attempt to determine the future of Russia in Europe as an antifascist force, influenced by its role in fighting fascism in World War II.

According to Alexander J. Motyl, an American historian and political scientist, Russian fascism has the following characteristics:
* An undemocratic political system, different from both traditional authoritarianism and totalitarianism;
* Statism and hypernationalism;
* A hypermasculine cult of the supreme leader (emphasis on his courage, militancy and physical prowess);
* General popular support for the regime and its leader.

Yale historian Timothy Snyder has stated that &quot;Putin&#x27;s regime is ... the world center of fascism&quot; and has written an article entitled &quot;We Should Say It: Russia Is Fascist.&quot; Oxford historian Roger Griffin compared Putin&#x27;s Russia to the World War II-era Empire of Japan, saying that like Putin&#x27;s Russia, it &quot;emulated fascism in many ways, but was not fascist.&quot; Historian Stanley G. Payne says Putin&#x27;s Russia &quot;is not equivalent to the fascist regimes of World War II, but it forms the nearest analogue to fascism found in a major country since that time&quot; and argues that Putin&#x27;s political system is &quot;more a revival of the creed of Tsar Nicholas I in the 19th century that emphasized &#x27;Orthodoxy, autocracy, and nationality&#x27; than one resembling the revolutionary, modernizing regimes of Hitler and Mussolini.&quot; According to Griffin, fascism is &quot;a revolutionary form of nationalism&quot; seeking to destroy the old system and remake society, and that Putin is a reactionary politician who is not trying to create a new order &quot;but to recreate a modified version of the Soviet Union&quot;. German political scientist Andreas Umland said genuine fascists in Russia, like deceased politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky and activist and self-styled philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, &quot;describe in their writings a completely new Russia&quot; controlling parts of the world that were never under tsarist or Soviet domination. According to Marlene Laurelle writing in &quot;The Washington Quarterly&quot;, &quot;applying the &quot;fascism&quot; label ... to the entirety of the Russian state or society short-circuits our ability to construct a more complex and differentiated picture.&quot;

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, collecting the opinions of experts on fascism, said that while Russia is repressive and authoritarian, it cannot be classified as a fascist state for various reasons, including Russia&#x27;s government being more reactionary than revolutionary. In 2023, Oleg Orlov, the chairman of the Board of Human Rights Center &quot;Memorial&quot;, claimed that Russia under Vladimir Putin had descended into fascism and that the army is committing &quot;mass murder&quot;. On 7 March 2024, in his 2024 State of the Union Address, American President Joe Biden compared Russia under Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s conquests of Europe.

==Tenets==
Robert O. Paxton finds that even though fascism &quot;maintained the existing regime of property and social hierarchy&quot;, it cannot be considered &quot;simply a more muscular form of conservatism&quot; because &quot;fascism in power did carry out some changes profound enough to be called &#x27;revolutionary. These transformations &quot;often set fascists into conflict with conservatives rooted in families, churches, social rank, and property.&quot; Paxton argues:

fascism redrew the frontiers between private and public, sharply diminishing what had once been untouchably private. It changed the practice of citizenship from the enjoyment of constitutional rights and duties to participation in mass ceremonies of affirmation and conformity. It reconfigured relations between the individual and the collectivity, so that an individual had no rights outside community interest. It expanded the powers of the executive—party and state—in a bid for total control. Finally, it unleashed aggressive emotions hitherto known in Europe only during war or social revolution.

===Nationalism with or without expansionism===
Ultranationalism, combined with the myth of national rebirth, is a key foundation of fascism. Robert Paxton argues that &quot;a passionate nationalism&quot; is the basis of fascism, combined with &quot;a conspiratorial and Manichean view of history&quot; which holds that &quot;the chosen people have been weakened by political parties, social classes, unassimilable minorities, spoiled rentiers, and rationalist thinkers.&quot; Roger Griffin identifies the core of fascism as being palingenetic ultranationalism.

The fascist view of a nation is of a single organic entity that binds people together by their ancestry and is a natural unifying force of people. Fascism seeks to solve economic, political, and social problems by achieving a millenarian national rebirth, exalting the nation or race above all else and promoting cults of unity, strength, and purity. European fascist movements typically espouse a racist conception of non-Europeans being inferior to Europeans. Beyond this, European fascists have not held a unified set of racial views. Historically, most fascists promoted imperialism, although there have been several fascist movements that were uninterested in the pursuit of new imperial ambitions. For example, Nazism and Italian Fascism were expansionist and irredentist. Falangism in Spain envisioned the worldwide unification of Spanish-speaking peoples (). British Fascism was non-interventionist, though it did embrace the British Empire.

===Totalitarianism===
Fascism promotes the establishment of a totalitarian state. It opposes liberal democracy, rejects multi-party systems, and may support a one-party state so that it may synthesize with the nation. Mussolini&#x27;s &quot;The Doctrine of Fascism&quot; (1932), partly ghostwritten by philosopher Giovanni Gentile, who Mussolini described as &quot;the philosopher of Fascism&quot;, states: &quot;The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State—a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values—interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people.&quot; In &quot;The Legal Basis of the Total State&quot;, Nazi political theorist Carl Schmitt described the Nazi intention to form a &quot;strong state which guarantees a totality of political unity transcending all diversity&quot; in order to avoid a &quot;disastrous pluralism tearing the German people apart.&quot;

Fascist states pursued policies of social indoctrination through propaganda in education and the media, and regulation of the production of educational and media materials. Education was designed to glorify the fascist movement and inform students of its historical and political importance to the nation. It attempted to purge ideas that were not consistent with the beliefs of the fascist movement and to teach students to be obedient to the state.

===Economy===
Historians and other scholars disagree on the question of whether a specifically fascist type of economic policy can be said to exist. David Baker argues that there is an identifiable economic system in fascism that is distinct from those advocated by other ideologies, comprising essential characteristics that fascist nations shared. Payne, Paxton, Sternhell &quot;et al.&quot; argue that while fascist economies share some similarities, there is no distinctive form of fascist economic organization. Gerald Feldman and Timothy Mason argue that fascism is distinguished by an absence of coherent economic ideology and a lack of serious economic thinking. They state that the decisions taken by fascist leaders cannot be explained within a logical economic framework.

Fascists presented their views as an alternative to both international socialism and free-market capitalism. While fascism opposed mainstream socialism, fascists sometimes regarded their movement as a type of nationalist &quot;socialism&quot; to highlight their commitment to nationalism, describing it as national solidarity and unity. Fascism had a complex relationship with capitalism, both supporting and opposing different aspects of it at different times and in different countries. In general, fascists held an instrumental view of capitalism, regarding it as a tool that may be useful or not, depending on circumstances. Fascists opposed international free market capitalism but supported a type of productive capitalism. Economic self-sufficiency, known as autarky, was a major goal of most fascist governments.

Fascist governments advocated for the resolution of domestic class conflict within a nation in order to guarantee national unity. This would be done through the state&#x27;s mediating relations between the classes (contrary to the views of classical liberal-inspired capitalists). While fascism was opposed to domestic class conflict, it held that bourgeois-proletarian conflict existed primarily in international conflict between proletarian nations and bourgeois nations. Fascism condemned what it viewed as widespread character traits that it associated with the typical bourgeois mentality that it opposed, such as materialism, crassness, cowardice, and the inability to comprehend the heroic ideal of the fascist &quot;warrior&quot;; and associations with liberalism, individualism, and parliamentarianism. In 1918, Mussolini defined what he viewed as the proletarian character, defining proletarian as being one and the same with producers, a productivist perspective that associated all people deemed productive, including entrepreneurs, technicians, workers and soldiers as being proletarian.

Because productivism was key to creating a strong nationalist state, it criticized internationalist and Marxist socialism, advocating instead to represent a type of nationalist productivist socialism. Nevertheless, while condemning parasitical capitalism, it was willing to accommodate productivist capitalism within it so long as it supported the nationalist objective. The role of productivism was derived from Henri de Saint Simon, whose ideas inspired the creation of utopian socialism and influenced other ideologies that stressed solidarity rather than class war and whose conception of productive people in the economy included both productive workers and productive bosses to challenge the influence of the aristocracy and unproductive financial speculators. Saint Simon&#x27;s vision combined the traditionalist right-wing criticisms of the French Revolution with a left-wing belief in the need for association or collaboration of productive people in society. Whereas Marxism condemned capitalism as a system of exploitative property relations, fascism saw the nature of the control of credit and money in the contemporary capitalist system as abusive.

Unlike Marxism, fascism did not see class conflict between the Marxist-defined proletariat and the bourgeoisie as a given or as an engine of historical materialism. Instead, it viewed workers and productive capitalists in common as productive people who were in conflict with parasitic elements in society, including corrupt political parties, corrupt financial capital, and feeble people. Fascist leaders such as Mussolini and Hitler spoke of the need to create a new managerial elite led by engineers and captains of industry—but free from the parasitic leadership of industries. Hitler stated that the Nazi Party supported (&quot;productive capitalism&quot;) that was based upon profit earned from one&#x27;s own labour, but condemned unproductive capitalism or loan capitalism, which derived profit from speculation.

Fascist economics supported a state-controlled economy that accepted a mix of private and public ownership over the means of production. Economic planning was applied to both the public and private sectors, and the prosperity of private enterprise depended on its acceptance of synchronizing itself with the economic goals of the state. Fascist economic ideology supported the profit motive but emphasized that industries must uphold the national interest as superior to private profit.

While fascism accepted the importance of material wealth and power, it condemned materialism, which was identified as being present in both communism and capitalism, and criticized materialism for lacking acknowledgment of the role of the spirit. In particular, fascists criticized capitalism, not because of its competitive nature nor support of private property, which fascists supported—but due to its materialism, individualism, alleged bourgeois decadence and alleged indifference to the nation. Fascism denounced Marxism for its advocacy of materialist internationalist class identity, which fascists regarded as an attack upon the emotional and spiritual bonds of the nation and a threat to the achievement of genuine national solidarity.

In discussing the spread of fascism beyond Italy, historian Philip Morgan states: Since the Depression was a crisis of laissez-faire capitalism and its political counterpart, parliamentary democracy, fascism could pose as the &#x27;third-way&#x27; alternative between capitalism and Bolshevism, the model of a new European &#x27;civilization.&#x27; As Mussolini typically put it in early 1934, &#x27;from 1929 ... fascism has become a universal phenomenon ... The dominant forces of the 19th century, democracy, socialism, [and] liberalism have been exhausted ... the new political and economic forms of the twentieth-century are fascist&#x27;.

Fascists criticized egalitarianism as preserving the weak and instead promoted social Darwinist views and policies. They were in principle opposed to the idea of social welfare, arguing that it &quot;encouraged the preservation of the degenerate and the feeble.&quot; The Nazi Party condemned the welfare system of the Weimar Republic, as well as private charity and philanthropy, for supporting people whom they regarded as racially inferior and weak and who should have been weeded out in the process of natural selection. Nevertheless, faced with the mass unemployment and poverty of the Great Depression, the Nazis found it necessary to set up charitable institutions to help racially pure Germans in order to maintain popular support while arguing that this represented &quot;racial self-help&quot; and not indiscriminate charity or universal social welfare. Thus, Nazi programs such as the Winter Relief of the German People and the broader National Socialist People&#x27;s Welfare (NSV) were organized as quasi-private institutions, officially relying on private donations from Germans to help others of their race—although in practice those who refused to donate could face severe consequences. Unlike the social welfare institutions of the Weimar Republic and the Christian charities, the NSV distributed assistance on explicitly racial grounds. It provided support only to those who were &quot;racially sound, capable of and willing to work, politically reliable, and willing and able to reproduce.&quot; Non-Aryans were excluded, as well as the &quot;work-shy&quot;, &quot;asocials&quot; and the &quot;hereditarily ill&quot;. Under these conditions, by 1939, over 17 million Germans had obtained assistance from the NSV, and the agency &quot;projected a powerful image of caring and support&quot; for &quot;those who were judged to have got into difficulties through no fault of their own.&quot; Yet the organization was &quot;feared and disliked among society&#x27;s poorest&quot; because it resorted to intrusive questioning and monitoring to judge who was worthy of support.

===Direct action===
Fascism emphasizes direct action, including supporting the legitimacy of political violence, as a core part of its politics. Fascism views violent action as a necessity in politics that fascism identifies as being an &quot;endless struggle&quot;; this emphasis on the use of political violence means that most fascist parties have also created their own private militias (e.g. the Nazi Party&#x27;s Brown shirts and Fascist Italy&#x27;s Blackshirts). The basis of fascism&#x27;s support of violent action in politics is connected to social Darwinism. Fascist movements have commonly held social Darwinist views of nations, races, and societies. They say that nations and races must purge themselves of socially and biologically weak or degenerate people while simultaneously promoting the creation of strong people in order to survive in a world defined by perpetual national and racial conflict.

===Age and gender roles===
Fascism emphasizes youth both in a physical sense of age and a spiritual sense as related to virility and commitment to action. The Italian Fascists&#x27; political anthem was called &quot;Giovinezza&quot; (&quot;The Youth&quot;). Fascism identifies the physical age period of youth as a critical time for the moral development of people who will affect society. Walter Laqueur argues that &quot;[t]he corollaries of the cult of war and physical danger were the cult of brutality, strength, and sexuality ... [fascism is] a true counter-civilization: rejecting the sophisticated rationalist humanism of Old Europe, fascism sets up as its ideal the primitive instincts and primal emotions of the barbarian.&quot;

Italian fascism pursued what it called &quot;moral hygiene&quot; of youth, particularly regarding sexuality. Fascist Italy promoted what it considered normal sexual behaviour in youth while denouncing what it considered deviant sexual behaviour. It condemned pornography, most forms of birth control and contraceptive devices (with the exception of the condom), homosexuality and prostitution as deviant sexual behaviour. However, enforcement of laws opposed to such practices was erratic, and authorities often looked the other way. Fascist Italy regarded the promotion of male sexual excitation before puberty as the cause of criminality amongst male youth, declared homosexuality a social disease and pursued an aggressive campaign to reduce prostitution of young women.

Mussolini perceived women&#x27;s primary role as primarily child bearers, while that of men as warriors, once saying: &quot;War is to man what maternity is to the woman.&quot; In an effort to increase birth rates, the Italian Fascist government gave financial incentives to women who raised large families and initiated policies intended to reduce the number of women employed. Italian Fascism called for women to be honoured as &quot;reproducers of the nation&quot;, and the Italian Fascist government held ritual ceremonies to celebrate women&#x27;s role within the Italian nation. In 1934, Mussolini declared that employment of women was a &quot;major aspect of the thorny problem of unemployment&quot; and that for women, working was &quot;incompatible with childbearing&quot;; Mussolini went on to say that the solution to unemployment for men was the &quot;exodus of women from the work force.&quot;

The German Nazi government strongly encouraged women to stay at home to bear children and keep house. This policy was reinforced by bestowing the Cross of Honor of the German Mother on women bearing four or more children. The unemployment rate was cut substantially, mostly through arms production and sending women home so that men could take their jobs. Nazi propaganda sometimes promoted premarital and extramarital sexual relations, unwed motherhood and divorce, but at other times the Nazis opposed such behaviour.

The Nazis decriminalized abortion in cases where fetuses had hereditary defects or were of a race the government disapproved of, while the abortion of healthy pure German, Aryan fetuses remained strictly forbidden. For non-Aryans, abortion was often compulsory. Their eugenics program also stemmed from the &quot;progressive biomedical model&quot; of Weimar Germany. In 1935, Nazi Germany expanded the legality of abortion by amending its eugenics law to promote abortion for women with hereditary disorders. The law allowed abortion if a woman gave her permission and the fetus was not yet viable and for purposes of so-called racial hygiene.

The Nazis said that homosexuality was degenerate, effeminate, perverted, and undermined masculinity because it did not produce children. They considered homosexuality curable through therapy, citing modern scientism and the study of sexology. Open homosexuals were interned in Nazi concentration camps.

===Palingenesis and modernism===

Fascism emphasizes both palingenesis (national rebirth or re-creation) and modernism. In particular, fascism&#x27;s nationalism has been identified as having a palingenetic character. Fascism promotes the nation&#x27;s regeneration and purging it of decadence. Fascism accepts forms of modernism that it deems promote national regeneration while rejecting forms of modernism regarded as antithetical to national regeneration. Fascism aestheticized modern technology and its association with speed, power, and violence. Fascism admired advances in the economy in the early 20th century, particularly Fordism and scientific management. Fascist modernism has been recognized as inspired or developed by various figures—such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Ernst Jünger, Gottfried Benn, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Knut Hamsun, Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis.

In Italy, such modernist influence was exemplified by Marinetti, who advocated a palingenetic modernist society that condemned liberal-bourgeois values of tradition and psychology while promoting a technological-martial religion of national renewal that emphasized militant nationalism. In Germany, it was exemplified by Jünger who was influenced by his observation of the technological warfare during World War I and claimed that a new social class had been created that he described as the &quot;warrior-worker&quot;; Like Marinetti, Jünger emphasized the revolutionary capacities of technology. He emphasized an &quot;organic construction&quot; between humans and machines as a liberating and regenerative force that challenged liberal democracy, conceptions of individual autonomy, bourgeois nihilism, and decadence. He conceived of a society based on a totalitarian concept of &quot;total mobilization&quot; of such disciplined warrior-workers.

==Culture==
===Aesthetics===

In &quot;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&quot; (1935), Walter Benjamin identifies aestheticization of politics as a key ingredient in fascist regimes. On this point he quotes Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, founder of the Futurist art movement and co-author of the Fascist Manifesto (1919), who aestheticizes war in his writings and claims that &quot;war is beautiful.&quot;

In &quot;Simulacra and Simulation&quot; (1981), Jean Baudrillard interprets fascism as a &quot;political aesthetic of death&quot; and a vehement countermovement against the increasing rationalism, secularism, and pacifism of the modern Western world.

The standard definition of fascism, given by Stanley G. Payne, focuses on three concepts, one of which is a &quot;fascist style&quot; with an aesthetic structure of meetings, symbols, and political liturgy, stressing emotional and mystical aspects.

Emilio Gentile argues that fascism expresses itself aesthetically more than theoretically by means of a new political style with myths, rites, and symbols as a lay religion designed to acculturate, socialize, and integrate the faith of the masses with the goal of creating a &quot;new man&quot;.

Cultural critic Susan Sontag writes:

Sontag also enumerates some commonalities between fascist art and the official art of communist countries, such as the obeisance of the masses to the hero, and a preference for the monumental and the &quot;grandiose and rigid&quot; choreography of mass bodies. But whereas official communist art &quot;aims to expound and reinforce a utopian morality&quot;, the art of fascist countries such as Nazi Germany &quot;displays a utopian aesthetics – that of physical perfection&quot;, in a way that is &quot;both prurient and idealizing&quot;.

According to Sontag, fascist aesthetics &quot;is based on the containment of vital forces; movements are confined, held tight, held in.&quot; Its appeal is not necessarily limited to those who share the fascist political ideology because fascism &quot;stands for an ideal or rather ideals that are persistent today under the other banners: the ideal of life as art, the cult of beauty, the fetishism of courage, the dissolution of alienation in ecstatic feelings of community; the repudiation of the intellect; the family of man (under the parenthood of leaders).&quot;

===Popular culture===
In Italy, the Mussolini regime created the to encourage film studios to glorify fascism. Italian cinema flourished because the regime stopped the import of Hollywood films in 1938, subsidized domestic production, and kept ticket prices low. It encouraged international distribution to glorify its African empire and to belie the charge that Italy was backward. The regime censored criticism and used the state-run Luce Institute film company to laud the Duce through newsreels, documentaries, and photographs. The regime promoted Italian opera and theatre as well, making sure that political enemies did not have a voice on stage.

In Nazi Germany the new Reich Chamber of Culture was under the control of Joseph Goebbels, Hitler&#x27;s powerful Reich Minister for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. The goal was to stimulate the Aryanization of German culture and to prohibit postmodern trends such as surrealism and cubism.

==Criticism==
Fascist parties were closely contested by anti-fascist movements from the political centre and left wing throughout the Interwar period. The defeat of the Axis powers in World War II and subsequent revelation of the crimes against humanity committed during the Holocaust by Germany have led to an almost universal condemnation of both past and present forms of fascism in the modern era. &quot;Fascism&quot; is today used across the political spectrum as a pejorative or byword for perceived authoritarianism and other forms of political evil.

===Anti-democratic and tyrannical===
One of the most common and strongest criticisms of fascism is that it is a tyranny. Fascism is deliberately and entirely non-democratic and anti-democratic.

Fascism&#x27;s extreme authoritarianism and nationalism often manifest as a belief in racial purity or a master race, usually blended with some variant of racism or discrimination against a demonized &quot;Other&quot;, such as Jews, homosexuals, transgender people, ethnic minorities, or immigrants. These ideas have motivated fascist regimes to commit massacres, forced sterilizations, deportations, and genocides. During World War II, the genocidal and imperialist ambitions of the fascist Axis powers resulted in the murder of millions of people. Federico Finchelstein wrote that fascism 

===Unprincipled opportunism===
Some critics of Italian fascism have said that much of the ideology was merely a by-product of unprincipled opportunism by Mussolini and that he changed his political stances merely to bolster his personal ambitions while he disguised them as being purposeful to the public. Richard Washburn Child, the American ambassador to Italy who worked with Mussolini and became his friend and admirer, defended Mussolini&#x27;s opportunistic behaviour by writing: Opportunist is a term of reproach used to brand men who fit themselves to conditions for the reasons of self-interest. Mussolini, as I have learned to know him, is an opportunist in the sense that he believed that mankind itself must be fitted to changing conditions rather than to fixed theories, no matter how many hopes and prayers have been expended on theories and programmes. Child quoted Mussolini as saying: &quot;The sanctity of an ism is not in the ism; it has no sanctity beyond its power to do, to work, to succeed in practice. It may have succeeded yesterday and fail to-morrow. Failed yesterday and succeed to-morrow. The machine, first of all, must run!&quot;

Some have criticized Mussolini&#x27;s actions during the outbreak of World War I as opportunistic for seeming to suddenly abandon Marxist egalitarian internationalism for non-egalitarian nationalism and note, to that effect, that upon Mussolini endorsing Italy&#x27;s intervention in the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary, he and the new fascist movement received financial support from Italian and foreign sources, such as Ansaldo (an armaments firm) and other companies as well as the British Security Service MI5. Some, including Mussolini&#x27;s socialist opponents at the time, have noted that regardless of the financial support he accepted for his pro-interventionist stance, Mussolini was free to write whatever he wished in his newspaper without prior sanctioning from his financial backers. Furthermore, the major source of financial support that Mussolini and the fascist movement received in World War I was from France and is widely believed to have been French socialists who supported the French government&#x27;s war against Germany and who sent support to Italian socialists who wanted Italian intervention on France&#x27;s side.

Mussolini’s transformation away from Marxism into what eventually became fascism began prior to World War I, as Mussolini had grown increasingly pessimistic about Marxism and egalitarianism while becoming increasingly supportive of figures who opposed egalitarianism, such as Friedrich Nietzsche. By 1902, Mussolini was studying Georges Sorel, Nietzsche and Vilfredo Pareto. Sorel&#x27;s emphasis on the need for overthrowing decadent liberal democracy and capitalism by the use of violence, direct action, general strikes and neo-Machiavellian appeals to emotion impressed Mussolini deeply. Mussolini&#x27;s use of Nietzsche made him a highly unorthodox socialist, due to Nietzsche&#x27;s promotion of elitism and anti-egalitarian views. Prior to World War I, Mussolini&#x27;s writings over time indicated that he had abandoned the Marxism and egalitarianism that he had previously supported in favour of Nietzsche&#x27;s concept and anti-egalitarianism. In 1908, Mussolini wrote a short essay called &quot;Philosophy of Strength&quot; based on his Nietzschean influence, in which Mussolini openly spoke fondly of the ramifications of an impending war in Europe in challenging both religion and nihilism: &quot;[A] new kind of free spirit will come, strengthened by the war, ... a spirit equipped with a kind of sublime perversity, ... a new free spirit will triumph over God and over Nothing.&quot;

===Ideological dishonesty===
Fascism has been criticized for being ideologically dishonest. Major examples of ideological dishonesty have been identified in Italian fascism&#x27;s changing relationship with German Nazism. Fascist Italy&#x27;s official foreign policy positions commonly used rhetorical ideological hyperbole to justify its actions, although during Dino Grandi&#x27;s tenure as Italy&#x27;s foreign minister the country engaged in free of such fascist hyperbole. Italian fascism&#x27;s stance towards German Nazism fluctuated from support from the late 1920s to 1934, when it celebrated Hitler&#x27;s rise to power and Mussolini&#x27;s first meeting with Hitler in 1934; to opposition from 1934 to 1936 after the assassination of Italy&#x27;s allied leader in Austria, Engelbert Dollfuss, by Austrian Nazis; and again back to support after 1936, when Germany was the only significant power that did not denounce Italy&#x27;s invasion and occupation of Ethiopia.

After antagonism exploded between Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy over the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss in 1934, Mussolini and Italian fascists denounced and ridiculed Nazism&#x27;s racial theories, particularly by denouncing its Nordicism, while promoting Mediterraneanism. Mussolini himself responded to Nordicists&#x27; claims of Italy being divided into Nordic and Mediterranean racial areas due to Germanic invasions of Northern Italy by claiming that while Germanic tribes such as the Lombards took control of Italy after the fall of Ancient Rome, they arrived in small numbers (about 8,000) and quickly assimilated into Roman culture and spoke the Latin language within fifty years. Italian fascism was influenced by the tradition of Italian nationalists scornfully looking down upon Nordicists&#x27; claims and taking pride in comparing the age and sophistication of ancient Roman civilization as well as the classical revival in the Renaissance to that of Nordic societies that Italian nationalists described as &quot;newcomers&quot; to civilization in comparison. At the height of antagonism between the Nazis and Italian fascists over race, Mussolini claimed that the Germans themselves were not a pure race and noted with irony that the Nazi theory of German racial superiority was based on the theories of non-German foreigners, such as Frenchman Arthur de Gobineau. After the tension in German-Italian relations diminished during the late 1930s, Italian fascism sought to harmonize its ideology with German Nazism and combined Nordicist and Mediterranean racial theories, noting that Italians were members of the Aryan Race, composed of a mixed Nordic-Mediterranean subtype.

In 1938, Mussolini declared upon Italy&#x27;s adoption of antisemitic laws that Italian fascism had always been antisemitic. However, Italian fascism did not endorse antisemitism until the late 1930s when Mussolini feared alienating antisemitic Nazi Germany, whose power and influence were growing in Europe. Prior to that period, there had been notable Jewish Italians who had been senior Italian fascist officials, including Margherita Sarfatti, who had also been Mussolini&#x27;s mistress. Also contrary to Mussolini&#x27;s claim in 1938, only a small number of Italian fascists were staunchly antisemitic (such as Roberto Farinacci and Giuseppe Preziosi), while others such as Italo Balbo, who came from Ferrara which had one of Italy&#x27;s largest Jewish communities, were disgusted by the antisemitic laws and opposed them. Fascism scholar Mark Neocleous notes that while Italian fascism did not have a clear commitment to antisemitism, there were occasional antisemitic statements issued prior to 1938, such as Mussolini in 1919 declaring that the Jewish bankers in London and New York were connected by race to the Russian Bolsheviks and that eight percent of the Russian Bolsheviks were Jews.

==Anti-fascism==

Anti-fascism is a political movement in opposition to fascist ideologies, groups and individuals. Beginning in European countries in the 1920s, it was at its most significant shortly before and during World War II, where the Axis powers were opposed by many countries forming the Allies of World War II and dozens of resistance movements worldwide. Anti-fascism has been an element of movements across the political spectrum and holding many different political positions such as anarchism, communism, pacifism, republicanism, social democracy, socialism and syndicalism as well as centrist, conservative, liberal and nationalist viewpoints.

Fascism, a far-right ultra-nationalistic ideology best known for its use by the Italian Fascists and the Nazis, became prominent beginning in the 1910s. Organization against fascism began around 1920. Fascism became the state ideology of Italy in 1922 and of Germany in 1933, spurring a large increase in anti-fascist action, including German resistance to Nazism and the Italian resistance movement. Anti-fascism was a major aspect of the Spanish Civil War, which foreshadowed World War II.

Before World War II, the West had not taken seriously the threat of fascism, and anti-fascism was sometimes associated with communism. However, the outbreak of World War II greatly changed Western perceptions, and fascism was seen as an existential threat by not only the communist Soviet Union but also by the liberal-democratic United States and United Kingdom. The Axis Powers of World War II were generally fascist, and the fight against them was characterized in anti-fascist terms. Resistance during World War II to fascism occurred in every occupied country, and came from across the ideological spectrum. The defeat of the Axis powers generally ended fascism as a state ideology.

After World War II, the anti-fascist movement continued to be active in places where organized fascism continued or re-emerged. There was a resurgence of antifa in Germany in the 1980s, as a response to the invasion of the punk scene by neo-Nazis. This influenced the antifa movement in the United States in the late 1980s and 1990s, which was similarly carried by punks. In the 21st century, this greatly increased in prominence as a response to the resurgence of the radical right, especially after the election of Donald Trump.

<text>A forge is a type of hearth used for heating metals, or the workplace (smithy) where such a hearth is located. The forge is used by the smith to heat a piece of metal to a temperature at which it becomes easier to shape by forging, or to the point at which work hardening no longer occurs. The metal (known as the &quot;workpiece&quot;) is transported to and from the forge using tongs, which are also used to hold the workpiece on the smithy&#x27;s anvil while the smith works it with a hammer. Sometimes, such as when hardening steel or cooling the work so that it may be handled with bare hands, the workpiece is transported to the slack tub, which rapidly cools the workpiece in a large body of water. However, depending on the metal type, it may require an oil quench or a salt brine instead; many metals require more than plain water hardening. The slack tub also provides water to control the fire in the forge.

== Types ==
=== Coal/coke/charcoal forge ===
A forge typically uses bituminous coal, industrial coke or charcoal as the fuel to heat metal. The designs of these forges have varied over time, but whether the fuel is coal, coke or charcoal the basic design has remained the same.

A forge of this type is essentially a hearth or fireplace designed to allow a fire to be controlled such that metal introduced to the fire may be brought to a malleable state or to bring about other metallurgical effects (hardening, annealing, and tempering as examples). The forge fire in this type of forge is controlled in three ways: amount of air, the volume of fuel, and shape of the fuel/fire.

Over thousands of years of forging, these devices have evolved in one form or another as the essential features of this type of forge:

* Tuyere—a pipe through which air can be forced into the fire
* Bellows or blower—a means for forcing air into the tuyere
* Hearth—a place where the burning fuel can be contained over or against the tuyere opening. Traditionally hearths have been constructed of mud-brick (adobe), fired brick, stone, or later, constructed of iron.

During operation, fuel is placed in or on the hearth and ignited. A source of moving air, such as a fan or bellows, introduces additional air into the fire through the tuyere. With additional air, the fire consumes fuel faster and burns hotter (and cleaner - smoke can be thought of as escaped potential fuel).

A blacksmith balances the fuel and air in the fire to suit particular kinds of work. Often this involves adjusting and maintaining the shape of the fire.

In a typical coal forge, a firepot will be centred in a flat hearth. The tuyere will enter the firepot at the bottom. In operation, the hot core of the fire will be a ball of burning coke in and above the firepot. The heart of the fire will be surrounded by a layer of hot but not burning coke. Around the unburnt coke will be a transitional layer of coal being transformed into coke by the heat of the fire. Surrounding all is a ring or horseshoe-shaped layer of raw coal, usually kept damp and tightly packed to maintain the shape of the fire&#x27;s heart and to keep the coal from burning directly so that it &quot;cooks&quot; into coke first.

If a larger fire is necessary, the smith increases the air flowing into the fire as well as feeding and deepening the coke heart. The smith can also adjust the length and width of the fire in such a forge to accommodate different shapes of work.

The major variation from the forge and fire just described is a &#x27;backdraft&#x27; where there is no fire pot, and the tuyere enters the hearth horizontally from the back wall.

Coke and charcoal may be burned in the same forges that use coal, but since there is no need to convert the raw fuel at the heart of the fire (as with coal), the fire is handled differently.

Individual smiths and specialized applications have fostered the development of a variety of forges of this type, from the coal forge described above to simpler constructions amounting to a hole in the ground with a pipe leading into it.

=== Gas forge ===
A gas forge typically uses propane or natural gas as the fuel. One common, efficient design uses a cylindrical forge chamber and a burner tube mounted at a right angle to the body. The chamber is typically lined with refractory materials such as a hard castable refractory ceramic or a soft ceramic thermal blanket (ex: Kaowool). The burner mixes fuel and air which are ignited at the tip, which protrudes a short way into the chamber lining. The air pressure, and therefore heat, can be increased with a mechanical blower or by taking advantage of the Venturi effect.

Gas forges vary in size and construction, from large forges using a big burner with a blower or several atmospheric burners to forges built out of a coffee can utilizing a cheap, simple propane torch. A small forge can even be carved out of a single soft firebrick.

The primary advantage of a gas forge is the ease of use, particularly for a novice. A gas forge is simple to operate compared to coal forges, and the fire produced is clean and consistent. They are less versatile, as the fire cannot be reshaped to accommodate large or unusually shaped pieces. It is also difficult to heat a small section of a piece. A common misconception is that gas forges cannot produce enough heat to enable forge-welding, but a well-designed gas forge is hot enough for any task.

=== Finery forge ===

A finery forge is a water-powered mill where pig iron is refined into wrought iron.

==Forging equipment==
=== Anvil ===
The anvil serves as a workbench to the blacksmith, where the metal to be forged is worked. Anvils may seem clunky and heavy, but they are a highly refined tool carefully shaped to suit a blacksmith&#x27;s needs. Anvils are made of cast or wrought iron with a tool steel face welded on or of a single piece of cast or forged tool steel. Some anvils are made of only cast iron and have no tool steel face. These are not real anvils, and will not serve a blacksmith as such because they are too soft. A common term for a cast iron anvil is &quot;ASO&quot; or &quot;Anvil Shaped Object&quot;. The purpose of a tool steel face on an anvil is to provide what some call &quot;rebound&quot; as well as being hard and not denting easily from misplaced hammer blows. The term rebound means it projects some of the force of the blacksmith&#x27;s hammer blows back into the metal thus moving more metal at once than if there were no rebound. A good anvil can project anywhere from 50 to 99% of the energy back into the workpiece. The flat top, called the &quot;face&quot; is highly polished and usually has two holes (but can have more or less depending on the design). The square hole is called the hardy hole, where the square shank of the hardy tool fits. There are many different kinds of hardy tools. The smaller hole is called the pritchel hole, used as a bolster when punching holes in hot metal, or to hold tools similar to how the hardy tool does, but for tools that require being able to turn a 360-degree angle such as a hold-down tool for when the blacksmith&#x27;s tongs cannot hold a workpiece as securely as it needs to be. On the front of the anvil, there is sometimes a &quot;horn&quot; that is used for bending, drawing out steel, and many other tasks. Between the horn and the anvil face, there is often a small area called a &quot;step&quot; or a &quot;cutting table&quot; That is used for cutting hot or cold steel with chisels, and hot cut tools without harming the anvil&#x27;s face. Marks on the face transfer into imperfections in the blacksmith&#x27;s work.

===Hammer===
There are many types of hammer used in a blacksmith&#x27;s workshop but this will name just a few common ones. Hammers can range in shape and weight from half an ounce to nearly 30 pounds depending on the type of work being done with it.

# Hand hammer - used by the smith.
#* Ball-peen hammer
#* Cross-peen hammer
#* Straight-peen hammer
#* Rounding hammer
# Sledge hammer - used by the striker.

=== Chisel ===

Chisels are made of high carbon steel. They are hardened and tempered at the cutting edge while the head is left soft so it will not crack when hammered. Chisels are of two types, hot and cold chisels. The cold chisel is used for cutting cold metals while the hot chisel is for hot metals. Usually, hot chisels are thinner and therefore can not be substituted with cold chisels. Also, many smiths shape chisels as to have a simple twisted handle as to resemble a hammer, they can be used at a greater distance away from the hot metals. They are very useful and found throughout the world.
=== Tongs ===
Tongs are used by the blacksmith for holding hot metals securely. The mouths are custom made by the smith in various shapes to suit the gripping of various shapes of metal. It is not uncommon for a blacksmith to own twenty or more pairs of tongs; traditionally, a smith would start building their collection during the apprenticeship.
There are various types of tongs available in the market.
(1) flat tong
(2) rivet or ring tong
(3) straight lip fluted tong
(4) gad tong

=== Fuller ===

Fullers are forming tools of different shapes used in making grooves or hollows. They are often used in pairs, the bottom fuller has a square shank which fits into the hardy hole in the anvil while the top fuller has a handle. The work is placed on the bottom fuller and the top is placed on the work and struck with a hammer. The top fuller is also used for finishing round corners and for stretching or spreading metal.

=== Hardy ===

The hardy tool is a tool with a square shank that fits in a hardy hole. There are many different kinds of hardy tools such as the hot cut hardy, used for cutting hot metal on the anvil; the fuller tool, used for drawing out metal and making grooves; bending jigs - and too many others to list.

===Slack tub===
A &quot;slack tub&quot; is usually a large container full of water used by a blacksmith to quench hot metal. The slack tub is principally used to cool parts of the work during forging (to protect them, or keep the metal in one area from &quot;spreading&quot; for example, nearby hammer blows); to harden the steel; to tend a coal or charcoal forge; and simply to cool the work quickly for easy inspection. In bladesmithing and tool-making the term will usually be changed to a &quot;quench tank&quot; because oil or brine is used to cool the metal. The term slack is believed to derive from the word &quot;slake&quot;, as in slaking the heat.

== Types of forging ==
=== Drop forging ===
Drop forging is a process used to shape metal into complex shapes by dropping a heavy hammer with a die on its face onto the workpiece.

==== Process ====
The workpiece is placed into the forge. Then the impact of a hammer causes the heated material, which is very malleable, to conform to the shape of the die and die cavities. Typically only one die is needed to completely form the part. Extra space between the die faces causes some of the material to be pressed out of the sides, forming flash. This acts as a relief valve for the extreme pressure produced by the closing of the die halves and is later trimmed off of the finished part.

==== Equipment ====

The equipment used in the drop forming process is commonly known as a power or drop hammer. These may be powered by air, hydraulics, or mechanics. Depending on how the machine is powered, the mass of the ram, and the drop height, the striking force can be anywhere from 11,000 to 425,000 pounds.
The tools that are used, dies and punches, come in many different shapes and sizes, as well as materials. Examples of these shapes are flat and v-shaped which are used for open-die forging, and single or multiple-impression dies used for closed die forging. The designs for the dies have many aspects to them that must be considered. They all must be properly aligned, they must be designed so the metal and the flash will flow properly and fill all the grooves, and special considerations must be made for supporting webs and ribs and the parting line location. The materials must also be selected carefully. Some factors that go into the material selection are cost, their ability to harden, their ability to withstand high pressures, hot abrasion, heat cracking, and other such things. The most common materials used for the tools are carbon steel and, in some cases, nickel-based alloys.

==== Workpiece materials ====
The materials that are used most commonly in drop forging are aluminium, copper, nickel, mild steel, stainless steel, and magnesium. Mild steel is the best choice, and magnesium generally performs poorly as a drop forging material.

== Mythology ==

Various gods and goddesses are associated with the forge in a number of mythologies, such as the Irish Brigid, West African Ogun, Greek Hephaestus and Roman Vulcan.

<text>The Five Pillars of Islam (&#x27; ; also&#x27; &quot;pillars of the religion&quot;) are fundamental practices in Islam, considered to be obligatory acts of worship for all Muslims. They are summarized in the hadith of Gabriel. The Sunni and Shia agree on the basic details of the performance and practice of these acts, but the Shia do not refer to them by the same name (see Ancillaries of the Faith, for the Twelvers, and Seven pillars of Ismailism). They are: Muslim creed, prayer, charity to the poor, fasting in the month of Ramadan, and the pilgrimage to Mecca for those who are able.

== Translation of Rukn ==
The word &quot;rukn&quot; in Arabic refers to the corner of a building and the pillars are called &quot;umud&quot;. It is also used to refer to the basic elements or first principles of something. The &quot;arkan&quot; in military terms refers to the general staff. Thus, the translation &quot;five principles of Islam&quot; is more accurate than &quot;five pillars of Islam.&quot;

== Overview of the Five Pillars of Islam ==
The ritual obligations of Muslims are called the Five Pillars. They are acknowledged and practiced by Muslims throughout the world, notwithstanding their disparities. They are viewed as compulsory for individuals who genuinely wish to pursue a life like that which Islamic prophet Muhammad led. Like other religions, Islam holds certain practices to be standard; however, that does not imply that all individuals who regard themselves as Muslims necessarily observe them. Individual participation can vary depending on the individual&#x27;s faith; for example, not every individual prays every day, keeps the fast, performs the Hajj, or donates extensively to charity. There are also Muslim communities such as Alevis who reject the Five Pillars but follows Four Doors system.

Shortly after the Muslim Arabs conquered new terrains, they started raising mosques and castles and commissioning different commemorations and artifacts as articulations of their faith and culture. The religious practice of Islam, which signifies &quot;submission to God&quot;, depends on fundamentals that are known as the Five Pillars. Each of the five pillars is alluded to in the Quran, though in various chapters (&quot;suwar&quot;). Further insights concerning these commitments are given in the Hadith.

Though comparable practices were performed in pre-Islamic Arabia and by Jews and Christians at the time of Muhammad, they were changed in the Quran and Hadith, given a carefully monotheistic center, and identified with the life of Muhammad. In the Quran, in spite of the fact that the Shahada does not show up in full, Quran urges the individuals who accept to obey God and his Messenger. Prayer is alluded to multiple times, with prayer times referenced in Quran , and the demonstrations of bowing and prostrating in 48.29. In a few chapters, Muslims are urged both to pray and give alms (for example Q.), however what, when and to whom gifts ought to be made is clarified in more detail in the hadith. There is a critical entry on fasting in the Quran (), which alludes to the period of Ramadan and sets out the detail on who ought, and ought not fast, to a certain extent under specific conditions. Regarding the matter of the Hajj, the longest Quranic section () recommends the destination location of the pilgrimage, the lead and exercises of the individuals who participate, urging them to have God as a top priority consistently.

==Pillars of Sunni Islam==

=== First pillar: Shahada (Declaration of Faith) ===
The first pillar of Islam is the &quot;Shahada&quot;, the assertion of faith. There are two shahadas: &quot;There is no god but God&quot; and &quot;Muhammad is the messenger of God&quot;. This set statement is normally recited in Arabic: &quot;lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāhu muḥammadun rasūlu-llāh&quot; () &quot;There is no god but God (and) Muhammad is the messenger of God.&quot; It is essential to utter it to become a Muslim and to convert to Islam.

The first shahada promotes the essential unity of the faith, proclaiming that there is no god but God. The Tawhid, which is the prayer that states &quot;no god but God&quot; is a major component of the Islamic faith, for it asserts the monotheistic aspect of Islam, promoting unity of God as the source of existence. The second shahada demonstrates God&#x27;s essential mercy. This prayer proclaims Muhammad as the last prophet, and it uses Muhammad as the prime example of guidance for all Muslims. Muhammad received revelation that was distorted by earlier communities, such as Jewish and Christian societies; Muhammad was the recipient of the Quran&#x27;s guidance himself and now is bearer of this guidance for the rest of the Muslim community throughout history.

The Shahada, or profession of faith is said five times a day during prayer. It is the first thing said to a newborn, and the last thing to a person on their death-bed, showing how the Muslim prayer and the pillars are instrumental from the day a person is born until the day they die.

=== Second Pillar: Salah (Prayer) ===
The Second Pillar of Sunni Islam is Salah, or prayer. Before a prayer is observed, ablutions are performed including washing one&#x27;s hands, face and feet. A caller (Muezzin in Arabic) chants aloud from a raised place in the mosque. Verses from the Quran are recited either loudly or silently. These prayers are a very specific type of prayer and a very physical type of prayer called prostrations. These prayers are done five times a day, at set strict times, with the individual facing Mecca. The prayers are performed at dawn, noon, afternoon, evening, and night: the names are according to the prayer times: &quot;Fajr&quot; (dawn), &quot;Dhuhr&quot; (noon), &quot;ʿAṣr&quot; (afternoon), &quot;Maghrib&quot; (evening), and &quot;ʿIshāʾ&quot; (night). The Fajr prayer is performed before sunrise, Dhuhr is performed in the midday after the sun has surpassed its highest point, Asr is the evening prayer before sunset, Maghrib is the evening prayer after sunset and Isha is the night prayer. All of these prayers are recited while facing in the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca and form an important aspect of the Muslim Ummah. Muslims must wash before prayer; this washing is called &quot;wudu&quot; (&quot;purification&quot;). The prayer is accompanied by a series of set positions including; bowing with hands on knees, standing, prostrating and sitting in a special position (not on the heels, nor on the buttocks). At every change in position, &quot;God is great&quot; is said and it is a fixed tradition that has to be recited in each posture. A Muslim may perform their prayer anywhere, such as in offices, universities, and fields. However, the mosque is the preferable place for prayers because the mosque allows for fellowship. These prayers may also be observed individually if one is not able to go. The prayers are not required for women during their periods, prepubescent children and those with intellectual and physical disabilities inhibiting prayer. Those who are sick and unable to assume the positions of prayer are still required to pray, although they may pray in bed and even lying down. When traveling, one may observe the afternoon prayers following one another: also the sunset and late evening prayers can be combined too.

=== Third Pillar: Zakat (Almsgiving) ===
The Third Pillar of Islam is Zakāt, or alms giving or charity. Zakat means purification which indicates that a payment makes the rest of one&#x27;s wealth legally and religiously pure. By following this pillar, Muslims have to deduct certain amount of their wealth to support the Islamic community — usually about 2.5% of their wealth. This practice is not found in the Quran but rather in the hadith. The tax is used to take good care of the holy places and mosques in the individual&#x27;s specific Muslim community or to give assistance to those in need or who are impoverished. The word zakāt can be defined as purification and growth because it allows an individual to achieve balance and encourages new growth. The principle of knowing that all things belong to God is essential to purification and growth. Zakāt is obligatory for all Muslims who are able to do so. It is the personal responsibility of each Muslim to ease the economic hardship of others and to strive towards eliminating inequality. Zakāt consists of spending a portion of one&#x27;s wealth for the benefit of the poor or needy, such as debtors or travelers. A Muslim may also donate more as an act of voluntary charity (&quot;sadaqah&quot;), rather than to achieve additional divine reward. Also, Muslims are required to give back to the poor, specifically through financial support, on the streets in addition to the Zakāt. Zakāt shows how the Islam faith impacts the financial situation of a believer, drawing into all aspects of life.

There are five principles that should be followed when giving the zakāt:

# The giver must declare to God his intention to give the zakāt.
# The zakāt must be paid on the day that it is due.
# After the offering, the payer must not exaggerate on spending his money more than usual means.
# Payment must be in kind. This means if one is wealthy then he or she needs to pay a portion of their income. If a person does not have much money, then they should compensate for it in different ways, such as good deeds and good behavior toward others.
# The zakāt must be distributed in the community from which it was taken.

===Fourth Pillar: Sawm (Fasting)===
The Fourth Pillar of Islam is Sawm, or fasting. Fasting takes place during the daylight hours in Ramadan, which is the holy month in the Islamic calendar. Using a lunar calendar means the month of Ramadan shifts 11 days earlier each year. Sawm is directly mentioned in the Quran: &quot;eat and drink until the whiteness of the day becomes distinct from the blackness of the night at dawn, then complete the fast till night…&quot;. The fast occurs from dawn to sunset each day, during which time believers are expected to prohibit themselves from any food, drink, sexual intercourse, or smoking. However, after sunset and before dawn, individuals can participate in any of the actions previously stated as they desire. The reason for fasting during Ramadan is to remind Muslims that all individuals are similarly needy upon the assistance of God and that there are less lucky individuals who need their assistance. Ramadan is a period of reflection when Muslims are called upon to recharge their faith, increment their charity, and make apology. In the Quran, the month of Ramadan was first revealed to Muhammad. Ramadan fasting ends with the &quot;Id-ul-Fitr&quot; (Festival of the Breaking of the Fast), which lasts for three days; of the first day of this festival, there is a meeting at the mosque for prayer celebration and each family head gives money for alms. Three types of fasting (&quot;Siyam&quot;) are recognized by the Quran: ritual fasting, fasting as compensation for repentance (both from Quran 2), and ascetic fasting (from )

Ritual fasting is an obligatory act during the month of Ramadan. Muslims must abstain from food and drink from dawn to dusk during this month, and are to be especially mindful of other sins. Fasting is necessary for every Muslim that has reached puberty (unless he/she suffers from a medical condition which prevents him/her from doing so).

The fast is meant to allow Muslims to seek nearness and to look for forgiveness from God, to express their gratitude to and dependence on him, atone for their past sins, and to remind them of the needy. During Ramadan, Muslims are also expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam by refraining from violence, anger, envy, greed, lust, profane language, gossip and to try to get along with fellow Muslims better. In addition, all obscene and irreligious sights and sounds are to be avoided.

Fasting during Ramadan is obligatory, but exceptions are made for several groups for whom it would be very dangerous and excessively problematic. These include pre-pubescent children, those with a medical condition such as diabetes, elderly people, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. Observing fasts is not permitted for menstruating women. Other individuals for whom it is considered acceptable not to fast are those who are ill or traveling. Missed fasts usually must be made up for soon afterward, although the exact requirements vary according to circumstance.

=== Fifth Pillar: Hajj (Pilgrimage) ===
The final Pillar of Islam is the Hajj, or pilgrimage. During one&#x27;s life, a Muslim is required to make the pilgrimage to Mecca during the 12th month of the lunar calendar. This ritual consists of making journey to Mecca wearing only 2 white sheets so all of the pilgrims are identical and there is no class distinction among them. Amid the hajj, every single Muslim man dresses alike in a straightforward fabric, again to emphasize their uniformity. Ladies wear a less complex type of their ordinary dress. Pilgrims put the white sheets on when they enter the sanctuary area of Mecca and enter a state of &quot;ihram&quot; or purity. After a Muslim makes the trip to Mecca, he/she is known as a hajj/hajja (one who made the pilgrimage to Mecca). The main rituals of the Hajj include walking seven times around the Kaaba termed &quot;Tawaf&quot;, touching the Black Stone termed Istilam, traveling seven times between Mount Safa and Mount Marwah termed &quot;Sa&#x27;yee&quot;, and symbolically stoning the Devil in Mina termed Ramee. When at Mecca, the pilgrims go to the Ka’aba in the mosque and walk around it in a circle. They then pray together in official ceremonies, and then they go out to perform the &quot;standing ceremony&quot; to remember the Farewell Sermon of Muhammad on the Arafat. On the return trip, pilgrims stop in Mina, where they throw 7 stones at stone pillars that represent Satan as to express their hatred for Shaitan (Satan). They then return to Mecca for final ceremonies by circumambulating the Ka’aba seven times and then leave Mecca to journey back home. Inability to make the Hajj, whether because of physical strength, economic conditions, or other reasons, excuses the duty of Hajj. The Quran specifically says that only those capable of making the pilgrimage are required to do so. The reason for this journey is to follow in the footsteps of Muhammad, hoping to gain enlightenment as Muhammad did when he was in the presence of God. The pilgrimage of the Hajj is in the Quran.

The pilgrim, or the &quot;haji&quot;, is honoured in the Muslim community. Islamic teachers say that the Hajj should be an expression of devotion to God, not a means to gain social standing. The believer should be self-aware and examine their intentions in performing the pilgrimage. This should lead to constant striving for self-improvement. A pilgrimage made at any time other than the Hajj season is called an &quot;Umrah&quot;, and while not mandatory is strongly recommended.

==Pillars of Shia Islam==
=== Twelvers ===
Twelver Shia Islam has five Usul al-Din and ten Furu al-Din, i.e., the Shia Islamic beliefs and practices. The Twelver Shia Islam Usul al-Din, equivalent to a Shia Five Pillars, are all beliefs considered foundational to Islam, and thus classified a bit differently from those listed above. They are:

# &quot;Tawhid&quot; (monotheism: belief in the oneness of God)
# &quot;Adl&quot; (divine justice: belief in God&#x27;s justice)
# &quot;Nubuwwah&quot; (prophethood)
# &quot;Imamah&quot; (succession to Muhammad)
# &quot;Mi&#x27;ad&quot; (the day of judgment and the resurrection)

In addition to these five pillars, there are ten practices that Shia Muslims must perform, called the &quot;Ancillaries of the Faith&quot; (Arabic: furūʿ al-dīn).

# Salah: 5 daily prayers
# Sawm: Fasting Ramadan
# Zakat: Almsgiving, similar to Sunni Islam, it applies to money, cattle, silver, gold, dates, raisins, wheat, and barley.
# Khums: An annual taxation of one-fifth (20%) of the gains that a year has been passed on without using. Khums is paid to the Imams; indirectly to poor and needy people.
# Hajj: Pilgrimage to Mecca
# Jihad: Striving for the cause of God
# Enjoining good
# Forbidding wrong
# Tawalla: Expressing love towards good.
# Tabarra: Expressing disassociation and hatred towards evil.

=== Ismailis ===
Isma&#x27;ilis have their own pillars, which are as follows:

* Walayah &quot;Guardianship&quot; denotes love and devotion to God, the prophets, and the Ismaili Imams and their representatives
* Tawhid, &quot;Oneness of God&quot;.
* Salah: Unlike Sunni and Twelver Muslims, Nizari Ismailis reason that it is up to the current imām to designate the style and form of prayer.
* Zakat: with the exception of the Druze, all Ismaili madhhabs have practices resembling that of Sunni and Twelvers, with the addition of the characteristic Shia khums.
* Sawm: Nizaris and Musta&#x27;lis believe in both a metaphorical and literal meaning of fasting.
* Hajj: For Ismailis, this means visiting the imām or his representative and that this is the greatest and most spiritual of all pilgrimages. The Mustaali maintain also the practice of going to Mecca. The Druze interpret this completely metaphorically as &quot;fleeing from devils and oppressors&quot; and rarely go to Mecca.
* Jihad &quot;Struggle&quot;: &quot;the Greater Struggle&quot; and &quot;the Lesser Struggle&quot;.

== History of the Pillars ==
One of the greatest assumptions about Islamic history is that the Five Pillars were already set and in place at the time of Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632 CE. However, most changes to these Islamic rituals came from small differences among minority Muslim groups. The major beliefs of the Pillars were already in place, taking the shape of the life and beliefs of Muhammad. The Five Pillars are alluded to in the Quran, and some are even specifically stated in the Quran, like the Hajj to Mecca. However, the difference in practice of these traditions are accepted in Islam of the Five Pillars, but this does not mean they have all existed since the life of Muhammad. The evidence of differences shows pillars have not always been consistent to what they are today, so it has taken many years for the Pillars to get to their current and classic form.
