<text>&quot;God Save the King&quot; (alternatively &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; when the monarch is female) is the de facto national anthem of the United Kingdom, one of two national anthems of New Zealand, and the royal anthem of the Isle of Man, Canada and some other Commonwealth realms. The author of the tune is unknown and it may originate in plainchant, but an attribution to the composer John Bull has sometimes been made.

Beyond its first verse, which is consistent, &quot;God Save the King&quot; has many historic and extant versions. Since its first publication, different verses have been added and taken away and, even today, different publications include various selections of verses in various orders. In general, only one verse is sung. Sometimes two verses are sung and, on certain occasions, three.

The entire composition is the musical salute for the British monarch and royal consort, while other members of the royal family who are entitled to royal salute (such as the Prince of Wales, along with his spouse) receive just the first six bars. The first six bars also form all or part of the viceregal salute in some Commonwealth realms other than the UK (e.g., in Canada, governors general and lieutenant governors at official events are saluted with the first six bars of &quot;God Save the King&quot; followed by the first four and last four bars of &quot;O Canada&quot;), as well as the salute given to governors of British overseas territories.

In countries not part of the British Empire, the tune of &quot;God Save the King&quot; has provided the basis for various patriotic songs, ones generally connected with royal ceremony. The melody is used for the national anthem of Liechtenstein, &quot;; the royal anthem of Norway, &quot;; and the American patriotic song &quot;My Country, &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot; (also known as &quot;America&quot;). The melody was also used for the national anthem &quot;&quot; (&quot;Hail to thee in the Victor&#x27;s Crown&quot;) of the Kingdom of Prussia from 1795 until 1918; as the anthem of the German Emperor from 1871 to 1918; as &quot;The Prayer of Russians&quot;, the imperial anthem of the Russian Empire, from 1816 to 1833; and as the national anthem of Switzerland, &quot;&quot;, from the 1840s until 1961.

==History==
The text first appeared in England in the late 1590s, with the publication of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;. In Act IV, Scene I, Lady Anne says to Queen Elizabeth: &quot;Were red-hot steel to sear me to the brains! Anointed let me be with deadly venom, And die ere men can say &#x27;God save the Queen.&#x27;&quot;

In &quot;The Oxford Companion to Music&quot;, Percy Scholes points out the similarities to an early plainsong melody, although the rhythm is very distinctly that of a galliard, and he gives examples of several such dance tunes that bear a striking resemblance to &quot;God Save the King&quot;. Scholes quotes a keyboard piece by John Bull (1619) which has some similarities to the modern tune, depending on the placing of accidentals which at that time were unwritten in certain cases and left to the discretion of the player (see ). He also points to several pieces by Henry Purcell, one of which includes the opening notes of the modern tune, setting the words &quot;God Save the King&quot;. Nineteenth-century scholars and commentators mention the widespread belief that an old Scots carol, &quot;Remember O Thou Man&quot;, was the source of the tune.

The first published version that resembles the present song appeared in 1744, with no title but the heading &quot;For two voices&quot;, in an anthology originally named &quot;Harmonia Britannia&quot; but changed after only a few copies had been printed to &quot;Thesaurus Musicus&quot;. When the Jacobite pretender Charles Edward Stuart led the 1745 rising, the song spread among those loyal to King George II. The tune published in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1745 departs from that used today at several points, one as early as the first bar, but is otherwise clearly a strong relative of the contemporary anthem. It was recorded as being sung in London theatres in 1745, with, for example, Thomas Arne writing a setting of the tune for the Drury Lane Theatre.

Scholes&#x27; analysis includes mention of &quot;untenable&quot; and &quot;doubtful&quot; claims, as well as &quot;an American misattribution&quot;. Some of these are:
* James Oswald was a possible author of the &quot;Thesaurus Musicus&quot;, so may have played a part in the history of the song, but is not a strong enough candidate to be cited as the composer of the tune.
* Henry Carey: Scholes refutes this attribution: first on the grounds that Carey himself never made such a claim; second, when the claim was made by Carey&#x27;s son (in 1795), it was in support of a request for a pension from the British Government; and third, the younger Carey claimed that his father, who died in 1743, had written parts of the song in 1745. It has also been claimed that the work was first publicly performed by Carey during a dinner in 1740 in honour of Admiral Edward &quot;Grog&quot; Vernon, who had captured the Spanish harbour of Porto Bello (then in the Viceroyalty of New Granada, now in Panama) during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear.

Scholes recommends the attribution &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;traditional; earliest known version by John Bull (1562–1628)&quot;. The &quot;English Hymnal&quot; (musical editor Ralph Vaughan Williams) gives no attribution, stating merely &quot;17th or 18th cent.&quot;

==Use in the United Kingdom==
Like many aspects of British constitutional life, &quot;God Save the King&quot; derives its official status from custom and use, not from Royal Proclamation or Act of Parliament. The variation in the UK of the lyrics to &quot;God Save the King&quot; is the oldest amongst those currently used, and forms the basis on which all other versions used throughout the Commonwealth are formed; though, again, the words have varied over time.

England has no official national anthem of its own; &quot;God Save the King&quot; is treated as the English national anthem when England is represented at sporting events (though there are some exceptions to this rule, such as cricket where &quot;Jerusalem&quot; is used). There is a movement to establish an English national anthem, with Blake and Parry&#x27;s &quot;Jerusalem&quot; and Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; among the top contenders. Wales has a &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem, &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; (Land of my Fathers) while Scotland uses unofficial anthems (&quot;Scotland the Brave&quot; was traditionally used until the 1990s; since then, &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; is more commonly used), these anthems are used formally at state and national ceremonies as well as international sporting events such as football and rugby union matches. On all occasions in Northern Ireland, &quot;God Save the King&quot; is still used as the official anthem.

In 2001, it was claimed that the phrase &quot;No surrender&quot; was occasionally sung in the bridge before &quot;Send her victorious&quot; by England football fans at matches.

Since 2003, &quot;God Save the King&quot;, considered an all-inclusive anthem for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as other countries within the Commonwealth, has been dropped from the Commonwealth Games. Northern Irish athletes receive their gold medals to the tune of the &quot;Londonderry Air&quot;, popularly known as &quot;Danny Boy&quot;. In 2006, English winners heard Elgar&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Pomp and Circumstance March&quot; No. 1&quot;, usually known as &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;, but after a poll conducted by the Commonwealth Games Council for England prior to the 2010 Games, &quot;Jerusalem&quot; was adopted as England&#x27;s new Commonwealth Games anthem. In sports in which the UK competes as one nation, most notably as Great Britain at the Olympics, the anthem is used to represent anyone or any team that comes from the United Kingdom.

===Lyrics in the UK===
The phrase &quot;God Save the King&quot; is much older than the song, appearing, for instance, several times in the King James Bible. A text based on the 1st Book of Kings Chapter 1: verses 38–40, &quot;And all the people rejoic&#x27;d, and said: God save the King! Long live the King! May the King live for ever, Amen&quot;, has been sung and proclaimed at every coronation since that of King Edgar in 973. Scholes says that as early as 1545 &quot;God Save the King&quot; was a watchword of the Royal Navy, with the response being &quot;Long to reign over us&quot;. He also notes that the prayer read in churches on anniversaries of the Gunpowder Plot includes words which might have formed part of the basis for the former standard verse &quot;Scatter our enemies...assuage their malice and confound their devices&quot;.

In 1745, &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; published &quot;God save our lord the king: A new song set for two voices&quot;, describing it &quot;As sung at both Playhouses&quot; (the Theatres Royal at Drury Lane and Covent Garden). Traditionally, the first performance was thought to have been in 1745, when it was sung in support of King George II, after his defeat at the Battle of Prestonpans by the army of Charles Edward Stuart, son of James Francis Edward Stuart, the Jacobite claimant to the British throne.

It is sometimes claimed that, ironically, the song was originally sung in support of the Jacobite cause: the word &quot;send&quot; in the line &quot;Send him victorious&quot; could imply that the king was absent. However, the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites examples of &quot;[God] send (a person) safe, victorious, etc.&quot; meaning &quot;God grant that he may be safe, etc.&quot;. There are also examples of early 18th-century drinking glasses which are inscribed with a version of the words and were apparently intended for drinking the health of King James II and VII.

Scholes acknowledges these possibilities but argues that the same words were probably being used by both Jacobite and Hanoverian supporters and directed at their respective kings.

In 1902, the musician William Hayman Cummings, quoting mid-18th century correspondence between Charles Burney and Sir Joseph Banks, suggested that the words had been based on a Latin verse composed for King James II at the Chapel Royal.
====Standard version in the United Kingdom====
As the reigning monarch is currently Charles III, the male version of the anthem is used.

 When the current monarch is male 
When the monarch of the time is female, &quot;King&quot; is replaced with &quot;Queen&quot; and all masculine pronouns are replaced with their feminine equivalents.

There is no definitive version of the lyrics. However, the version consisting of the two above verses has the best claim to be regarded as the &quot;standard&quot; British version as referenced on the Royal Family website.
The song with an additional verse appears not only in the 1745 &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, but also in publications such as &quot;The Book of English Songs: From the Sixteenth to the Nineteenth Century&quot; (1851), &quot;National Hymns: How They Are Written and How They Are Not Written&quot; (1861), &quot;Household Book of Poetry&quot; (1882), and &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern, Revised Version&quot; (1982).

The same version with appears in publications including &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; (1908), and on the Royal Family website.

According to Alan Michie&#x27;s &quot;The Crown and the People&quot;, which was published in 1952, after the death of King George VI but before the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, when the first General Assembly of the United Nations was held in London in January 1946 the King, in honour of the occasion, &quot;ordered the belligerent imperious second stanza of &#x27;God Save the King&#x27; to be rewritten to bring it more into the spirit of the brotherhood of nations.&quot;

In the UK, the first verse is typically sung alone, even on official occasions, although the second verse is sometimes sung in addition on certain occasions such as during the opening ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics, 2012 Summer Paralympics, and the 2022 Commonwealth Games and usually at the Last Night of the Proms. The second verse was also sung during the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla.

====Standard version of the music====

The standard version of the melody and its key of G major are still those of the originally published version, although the start of the anthem is often signalled by an introductory timpani roll of two bars length. The bass line of the standard version differs little from the second voice part shown in the original, and there is a standard version in four-part harmony for choirs. The first three lines (six bars of music) are soft, ending with a short &quot;crescendo&quot; into &quot;Send him victorious&quot;, and then is another &quot;crescendo&quot; at &quot;over us:&quot; into the final words &quot;God save the King&quot;.

In the early 20th century there existed a military band version in the higher key of B, because it was easier for brass instruments to play in that key, though it had the disadvantage of being more difficult to sing; however, now most bands play it in the correct key of concert G.

Since 1953, the anthem is sometimes preceded by a fanfare composed by Gordon Jacob for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

====Alternative British versions====
There have been several attempts to rewrite the words. In the nineteenth century there was some lively debate about the national anthem as verse two was considered by some to be slightly offensive in its use of the phrase &quot;scatter her enemies&quot;. Some thought it placed better emphasis on the respective power of Parliament and the Crown to change &quot;her enemies&quot; to &quot;our enemies&quot;; others questioned the theology and proposed &quot;thine enemies&quot; instead. Sydney G. R. Coles wrote a completely new version, as did Canon F. K. Harford.

=====O Lord Our God Arise=====
An additional stanza sung second was previously considered part of the standard lyrics in the UK:

These lyrics appeared in some works of literature prior the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, but only the version mentioned in the Standard Version in the United Kingdom was used at her Coronation, and ever since on all official occasions when two stanzas have been sung.

=====William Hickson&#x27;s alternative version=====

In 1836, William Edward Hickson wrote an alternative version, of which the first, third, and fourth verses gained some currency when they were appended to the national anthem in &quot;The English Hymnal&quot; (1906). The fourth Hickson verse was sung after the traditional first verse at Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden Jubilee National Service of Thanksgiving in 2002, and during the raising of the Union Flag during the 2008 Summer Paralympics closing ceremony, in which London took Paralympic flag from Beijing to host the 2012 Summer games. This verse is currently used as the final verse by the Church of Scotland.

=====Samuel Reynolds Hole&#x27;s alternative version=====
To mark the celebration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, a modified version of the second verse was written by the Dean of Rochester, the Very Reverend Samuel Reynolds Hole. A four-part harmony setting was then made by Frederick Bridge, and published by Novello.

The &quot;Musical Times&quot; commented: &quot;There are some conservative minds who may regret the banishment of the &#x27;knavish tricks&#x27; and aggressive spirit of the discarded verse, but it must be admitted that Dean Hole&#x27;s lines are more consonant with the sentiment of modern Christianity.&quot; Others reactions were more negative, one report describing the setting as &quot;unwarrantable liberties...worthy of the severest reprobation&quot;, with &quot;too much of a Peace Society flavour about it...If we go about pleading for peace, other nations will get it into their heads that we are afraid of fighting.&quot; Perhaps unsurprisingly, Hole&#x27;s version failed to replace the existing verse permanently.

=====Official peace version=====
A less militaristic version of the song, titled &quot;Official peace version, 1919&quot;, was first published in the hymn book &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; in 1925. This was &quot;official&quot; in the sense that it was approved by the British Privy Council in 1919. However, despite being reproduced in some other hymn books, it is largely unknown today.
====Historic Jacobite and anti-Jacobite alternative verses====
Around 1745, anti-Jacobite sentiment was captured in a verse appended to the song, with a prayer for the success of Field Marshal George Wade&#x27;s army then assembling at Newcastle. These words attained some short-term use, although they did not appear in the published version in the October 1745 &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. This verse was first documented as an occasional addition to the original anthem by Richard Clark in 1814, and was also mentioned in a later article on the song, published by the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in October 1836. Therein, it is presented as an &quot;additional verse... though being of temporary application only... stored in the memory of an old friend... who was born in the very year 1745, and was thus the associate of those who heard it first sung&quot;, the lyrics given being:

The 1836 article and other sources make it clear that this verse was quickly abandoned after 1745 (Wade was replaced as Commander-in-Chief within a year following the Jacobite invasion of England), and it was certainly not used when the song became accepted as the British national anthem in the 1780s and 1790s. It was included as an integral part of the song in the &quot;Oxford Book of Eighteenth-Century Verse&quot; of 1926, although erroneously referencing the &quot;fourth verse&quot; to the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; article of 1745.

On the opposing side, Jacobite beliefs were demonstrated in an alternative verse used during the same period:

In May 1800, following an attempt to assassinate King George III at London&#x27;s Drury Lane theatre, playwright Richard Sheridan immediately composed an additional verse, which was sung from the stage the same night:

Various other attempts were made during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to add verses to commemorate particular royal or national events. For example, according to Fitzroy Maclean, when Jacobite forces bypassed Wade&#x27;s force and reached Derby, but then retreated and when their garrison at Carlisle Castle surrendered to a second government army led by King George&#x27;s son, the Duke of Cumberland, another verse was added. Other short-lived verses were notably anti-French, such as the following, quoted in the book &quot;Handel&quot; by Edward J. Dent:
However, none of these additional verses survived into the twentieth century. Updated &quot;full&quot; versions including additional verses have been published more recently, including the standard three verses, Hickson&#x27;s fourth verse, Sheridan&#x27;s verse and the Marshal Wade verse.

====Historic republican alternative====
A version from 1794 composed by the American republican and French citizen Joel Barlow celebrated the power of the guillotine to liberate:

===Performance in the UK===
The style most commonly heard in official performances was proposed as the &quot;proper interpretation&quot; by King George V, who considered himself something of an expert (in view of the number of times he had heard it). An Army Order was duly issued in 1933, which laid down regulations for tempo, dynamics and orchestration. This included instructions such as that the opening &quot;six bars will be played quietly by the reed band with horns and basses in a single phrase. Cornets and side-drum are to be added at the little scale-passage leading into the second half of the tune, and the full brass enters for the last eight bars&quot;. The official tempo for the opening section is a metronome setting of 60, with the second part played in a broader manner, at a metronome setting of 52. In recent years the prescribed sombre-paced introduction is often played at a faster and livelier tempo.

Until the latter part of the 20th century, theatre and concert goers were expected to stand while the anthem was played after the conclusion of a show. In cinemas this brought a tendency for audiences to rush out while the end credits played to avoid this formality. (This can be seen in the 1972 &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; episode &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Farewell&quot;.)

The anthem continues to be played at some traditional events such as Wimbledon, Royal Variety Performance, the Edinburgh Tattoo, Royal Ascot, Henley Royal Regatta and The Proms as well as at Royal events.

The anthem was traditionally played at close-down on the BBC, and with the introduction of commercial television to the UK this practice was adopted by some ITV companies (with the notable exceptions of Granada, Thames Television, Central Television, Border Television, and Yorkshire Television). BBC Two also never played the anthem at close-down, and ITV dropped the practice in the late 1980s when the network switched to 24 hour broadcasting, but it continued on BBC One until 8 November 1997 (thereafter BBC One began to simulcast with BBC News after end of programmes). The tradition is carried on, however, by BBC Radio 4, which plays the anthem each night as a transition piece between the end of the Radio 4 broadcasting and the move to BBC World Service. BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio 2 also play the National Anthem just before the 0700 and 0800 news bulletins on the actual and official birthdays of the King and the birthdays of senior members of the Royal Family. On 17 January 2022, the GB News Channel started playing the anthem at 05:59 every morning at the beginning of the day&#x27;s programming.

The UK&#x27;s national anthem usually prefaces The Sovereign&#x27;s Christmas Message (although in 2007 it appeared at the end, taken from a recording of the 1957 television broadcast), and important royal announcements, such as of royal deaths, when it is played in a slower, sombre arrangement.

====Performance in Lancashire====
===Other British anthems===
Frequently, when an anthem is needed for one of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom at an international sporting event, for instance an alternative song is used:

* England generally uses &quot;God Save the King&quot;, but &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; and &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; have also been used.
** At international test cricket matches, England has, since 2004, used &quot;Jerusalem&quot; as the anthem.
** At international rugby league matches, England uses &quot;God Save the King&quot; and also &quot;Jerusalem&quot;.
** At international rugby union and football matches, England uses &quot;God Save the King&quot;.
** At the Commonwealth Games, Team England uses &quot;Jerusalem&quot; as their victory anthem.
* Scotland uses &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; as their anthem for most sporting occasions.
* Wales uses &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; (&quot;Land of My Fathers&quot;) for governmental ceremonies and sporting occasions. At official occasions, especially those with royal connections, &quot;God Save the King&quot; is also played.
* Northern Ireland uses &quot;God Save the King&quot; as its national anthem. However, many Irish nationalists feel unrepresented by the British anthem and seek an alternative. Northern Ireland also uses the &quot;Londonderry Air&quot; as its victory anthem at the Commonwealth Games. When sung, the &quot;Londonderry Air&quot; has the lyrics to &quot;Danny Boy&quot;. At international rugby union matches, where Northern Irish players compete alongside those from the Republic of Ireland as part of an All-Ireland team, &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Call&quot; is used.
* The British and Irish Lions rugby union tour of 2005 used the song &quot;The Power of Four&quot;, but this experiment has not been repeated.
The London 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony provided a conscious use of three of the four anthems listed above; the ceremony began with a rendition of the first verse of &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, before a choir in Northern Ireland sang &quot;Danny Boy&quot; and a choir in Edinburgh performed part of &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot;. Notably, Wales was represented by the hymn &quot;Bread of Heaven&quot;, not &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadhau&quot;.

In April 2007, there was an early day motion, number 1319, to the British Parliament to propose that there should be a separate England anthem: &quot;That this House ... believes that all English sporting associations should adopt an appropriate song that English sportsmen and women, and the English public, would favour when competing as England&quot;. An amendment (EDM 1319A3) was proposed by Evan Harris that the song &quot;should have a bit more oomph than &quot;God Save The Queen&quot; and should also not involve God.&quot;

For more information see also:
* National anthem of England
* National anthem of Scotland
* Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau
* National anthem of Northern Ireland

===Use in media===
On 3 November 2016, Andrew Rosindell, a Conservative MP, argued in an early day motion for a return to the broadcasting of the national anthem at the end of BBC One transmissions each day (the practice had been dropped in 1997, due to BBC One adopting 24-hour broadcasting by simulcasting BBC News 24 overnight, rendering closedown obsolete), to commemorate the Brexit vote and Britain&#x27;s subsequent withdrawing from the European Union. At the evening of the same day, BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme ended its nightly broadcast with host of that night Kirsty Wark saying that they were &quot;incredibly happy to oblige&quot; Rosindell&#x27;s request, and then played a clip of the Sex Pistols&#x27; similarly named song, much to Rosindell&#x27;s discontent.

Since 18 January 2022, GB News has played &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; at the start of live programming every day.

==Use in other Commonwealth countries==
&quot;God Save the King&quot; was exported around the world via the expansion of the British Empire, serving as each country&#x27;s national anthem. Throughout the Empire&#x27;s evolution into the Commonwealth of Nations, the song declined in use in most states which became independent. In New Zealand, it remains one of the official national anthems.

===Australia===

In Australia, &quot;God Save the King&quot; was declared as the royal anthem on 27 October 2022, replacing the previous declaration of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; as the royal anthem on 19 April 1984. It declares that the song is to played when the monarch or a member of the royal family is present. The Australian Government also advises that when the King is in Australia, the royal anthem is played at the beginning of an event and the national anthem, &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;, is to be played at the end.

Prior to 1974, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; was the national anthem of Australia. It was replaced that year with &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; by the Labor Whitlam government. Following the elevation of the Liberal Fraser government, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; was restored as the national anthem in 1976 alongside three other &quot;national songs&quot;. A plebiscite held in 1977 preferred &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; as the exclusive &quot;national song&quot;, to exist alongside the national anthem of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;. The subsequent Labor Hawke government later advised the proclamation of &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; as the national anthem in 1984, with &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; redesignated as the royal anthem. 

===Belize===

&quot;God Save the King&quot; is the royal anthem of Belize. The Vice-Regal Salute to the Belizean governor general is composed of the first verse of &quot;God Save the King&quot; and the chorus of National Anthem, &quot;Land of the Free&quot;.

===Canada===
By convention, &quot;God Save the King&quot; (, when a Queen) is the royal anthem of Canada. It is sometimes played or sung together with the national anthem, &quot;O Canada&quot;, at private and public events organised by groups such as the Government of Canada, the Royal Canadian Legion, police services, and loyal groups. The governor general and provincial lieutenant governors are accorded the &quot;Viceregal Salute&quot;, comprising the first three lines of &quot;God Save the King&quot;, followed by the first and last lines of &quot;O Canada&quot;.

&quot;God Save the King&quot; has been sung in Canada since the late 1700s and by the mid 20th century was, along with &quot;O Canada&quot;, one of the country&#x27;s two national anthems, the first and last verses of the standard British version being used. By-laws and practices governing the use of either song during public events in municipalities varied; in Toronto, &quot;God Save the King&quot; was employed, while in Montreal it was &quot;O Canada&quot;. Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1964 said one song would have to be chosen as the country&#x27;s national anthem and, three years later, he advised Governor General Georges Vanier to appoint the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on the National and Royal Anthems. Within two months, on 12 April 1967, the committee presented its conclusion that &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; (as this was during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II), whose music and lyrics were found to be in the public domain, should be designated as the royal anthem of Canada and &quot;O Canada&quot; as the national anthem, one verse from each, in both official languages, to be adopted by parliament. The group was then charged with establishing official lyrics for each song; for &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, the English words were those inherited from the United Kingdom and the French words were taken from those that had been adopted in 1952 for the coronation of Elizabeth II. When the bill pronouncing &quot;O Canada&quot; as the national anthem was put through parliament, the joint committee&#x27;s earlier recommendations regarding &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; were not included.

The Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces regulates that &quot;God Save the King&quot; be played as a salute to the monarch of Canada and other members of the Canadian royal family, though it may also be used as a hymn or prayer. The words are not to be sung when the song is played as a military royal salute and is abbreviated to the first three lines, while arms are being presented. Elizabeth II stipulated that the arrangement in G major by Lieutenant Colonel Basil H. Brown be used in Canada. The authorised version to be played by pipe bands is &quot;Mallorca&quot;.

====Lyrics in Canada====
&quot;God Save the King&quot; has been translated into French, but this translation does not fit the music and cannot be sung. Nevertheless, this translation has been adapted into a bilingual version that can be sung when the monarch is male, and has been sung during public ceremonies, such as the National Remembrance Day Ceremony at the National War Memorial in Ottawa:

A special singable one-verse adaptation is used when a singable French version is required, such as when royalty is present at an official occasion:
There is a special Canadian verse in English which was once commonly sung in addition to the two standing verses:
===Channel Islands===
&quot;God Save the King&quot; is used by both Bailiwicks of the Channel Islands as an alternative to their respective national anthems. Its use case and popular version is generally similar to how it is used in the United Kingdom. However, the anthem has been translated in Jèrriais:

The meaning is broadly similar to the first paragraph of the English version, except for the first two lines which say &quot;God save our Duke&quot; and &quot;Long live our Duke&quot;.

===New Zealand===

New Zealand inherited &quot;God Save the King&quot; as its anthem, which served as the sole national anthem until 1977, when &quot;God Defend New Zealand&quot; was introduced as a second. Since then, &quot;God Save the King&quot; is most often only played when the sovereign, governor-general or other member of the Royal Family is present, or on some occasions such as Anzac Day. The Māori-language version was written by Edward Marsh Williams under the title, &quot;&quot;.

There is a special New Zealand verse in English which was once commonly sung to replace the second and third verses:
====Lyrics in Māori====
All verses of &quot;God Save the King&quot; have been translated into Māori. The first verse is shown below:
===Rhodesia===
When Rhodesia issued its Unilateral Declaration of Independence from the UK on 11 November 1965, it did so while still maintaining loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II as the Rhodesian head of state, despite the non-recognition of the Rhodesian government by the United Kingdom and the United Nations; &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; therefore remained the Rhodesian national anthem. This was supposed to demonstrate the continued allegiance of the Rhodesian people to the monarch, but the retention in Rhodesia of a song so associated with the UK while the two countries were at loggerheads regarding its constitutional status caused Rhodesian state occasions to have &quot;a faintly ironic tone&quot;, in the words of &quot;The Times&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; remained Rhodesia&#x27;s national anthem until March 1970, when the country formally declared itself a republic. &quot;Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia&quot; was adopted in its stead in 1974 and remained in use until the country returned to the UK&#x27;s control in December 1979. Since the internationally recognised independence of the Republic of Zimbabwe in April 1980, &quot;God Save the King&quot; has had no official status there.

===Saint Vincent and the Grenadines===
&quot;God Save the King&quot; is the royal anthem of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. It is played on royal and vice-regal occasions. The Vice-Regal Salute to the governor general is composed of the chorus of &quot;God Save the King&quot; and followed by that of the National Anthem, &quot;Saint Vincent, Land so Beautiful&quot;.

All proclamations in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines end with the phrase: &quot;God Save the King&quot;.

===South Africa===
&quot;God Save the King&quot; (, when a Queen) was a co-national anthem of South Africa from 1938 until 1957, when it was formally replaced by &quot;&quot; as the sole national anthem. The latter served as a sort of co-national anthem alongside the former until 1938.

==Use elsewhere==

The melody has often been used, with lyrics slightly or significantly altered, for royal or national anthems of other countries.

During the 19th century, it was used officially in Sweden, and in Iceland. It was also in official usage for brief periods in Imperial Russia, in Greece, Siam and in the Kingdom of Hawaii. 

In Germany, it was used by the kingdoms of Prussia, Hanover, Saxony and Bavaria, and was adopted as anthem of the German Empire (&quot;Heil dir im Siegerkranz&quot;) after unification in 1871. It remains as the national anthem of Liechtenstein, and was used by Switzerland until 1961.

In Latvia, it was used by Latvians for the patriotic song &quot;Dievs, svētī Kurzemi/Vidzemi!&quot; (&quot;God bless Kurzeme/Vidzeme!&quot;, depended on the region it was used in) in the 19th century.

==Musical adaptations==
===Composers===
About 140 composers have used the tune in their compositions.

Ludwig van Beethoven composed a set of seven piano variations in the key of C major to the theme of &quot;God Save the King&quot;, catalogued as WoO 78 (1802–1803). He also quotes it in his orchestral work &quot;Wellington&#x27;s Victory&quot;. It is also the first song arranged in the collection WoO 157.

Muzio Clementi used the theme to &quot;God Save the King&quot; in his Symphony No. 3 in G major, often called the &quot;Great National Symphony&quot;, catalogued as WoO 34. Clementi paid a high tribute to his adopted homeland (the United Kingdom) where he grew up and stayed most of his lifetime. He based the symphony (about 1816–1824) on &quot;God Save the King&quot;, which is hinted at earlier in the work, not least in the second movement, and announced by the trombones in the finale.

Johann Christian Bach composed a set of variations on &quot;God Save the King&quot; for the finale to his sixth keyboard concerto (Op. 1) written .

Joseph Haydn was impressed by the use of &quot;God Save the King&quot; as a national anthem during his visit to London in 1794, and on his return to Austria composed a different tune, &quot;&quot; (&quot;God Save Emperor Francis&quot;), for the birthday of the last Holy Roman Emperor and Roman-German King, Francis II, which became the basis for the anthem of the later Austrian Empire, and ultimately for the German national anthem.

Franz Liszt wrote a piano paraphrase on the anthem (S.259 in the official catalogue, c. 1841).

Johann Strauss I quoted &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; in full at the end of his waltz &quot;&quot; (Homage to Queen Victoria of Great Britain), Op. 103, where he also quoted &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; in full at the beginning of the piece.

Siegfried August Mahlmann in the early 19th century wrote alternate lyrics to adapt the hymn for the Kingdom of Saxony, as &quot;&quot; (&quot;God Bless Saxony&quot;).

Christian Heinrich Rinck wrote two sets of variations on the anthem: the last movement of his Piano Trio, Op. 34, No. 1 (1815) is a set of five variations and a concluding coda; and Theme (Andante) and (12) Variations in C major on &quot; (God Save the King), Op. 55.

Heinrich Marschner used the anthem in his &quot;, Op. 78 (1842).

Gaetano Donizetti used this anthem in his opera &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot;.

Joachim Raff used this anthem in his Jubelouverture, Op. 103 (1864) dedicated to Adolf, Duke of Nassau, on the 25th anniversary of his reign.

Gioachino Rossini used this anthem in the last scene of his , when all the characters, coming from many different European countries, sing a song which recalls their own homeland. Lord Sidney, bass, sings &quot;&quot; on the notes of &quot;God Save the King&quot;. Samuel Ramey used to interpolate a spectacular virtuoso cadenza at the end of the song.

Fernando Sor used the anthem in his 12 Studies, Op. 6: No. 10 in C major in the section marked &#x27;Maestoso.&#x27;

Arthur Sullivan quotes the anthem at the end of his ballet &quot;Victoria and Merrie England&quot;.

Claude Debussy opens with a brief introduction of &quot;God Save the King&quot; in one of his Preludes, &quot;Hommage à S. Pickwick Esq. P.P.M.P.C.&quot;. The piece draws its inspiration from the main character of the Charles Dickens novel &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;.

Niccolò Paganini wrote a set of highly virtuosic variations on &quot;God Save the King&quot; as his Op. 9.

Max Reger wrote &quot;Variations and Fugue on &quot; (God Save the King)&quot; for organ in 1901 after the death of Queen Victoria. It does not have an opus number.

A week before the Coronation Ode was due to be premiered at the June 1902 &quot;Coronation Gala Concert&quot; at Covent Garden (it was cancelled, owing to the King&#x27;s illness), Sir Edward Elgar introduced an arrangement of &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; as a solo song performed by Clara Butt at a &quot;Coronation Concert&quot; at the Albert Hall. Novello seized upon the prevailing patriotism and requested that Elgar arrange the National Anthem as an appropriate opening for a concert performed in front of the Court and numerous British and foreign dignitaries. This version for orchestra and chorus, which is enlivened by use of and marcato effects, was also performed at the opening of the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on St. George&#x27;s Day, 1924, and recorded under the composer&#x27;s baton in 1928, with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Philharmonic Choir. Elgar also used the first verse of the anthem as the climax of a short &quot;Civic Procession and Anthem&quot;, written to accompany the mayoral procession at the opening of the Hereford Music Festival on 4 September 1927. This premiere performance was recorded, and is today available on CD; the score was lost following the festival, and Elgar reconstructed it by ear from the recording.

Carl Maria von Weber uses the &quot;God Save the King&quot; theme at the end of his &quot;Jubel Overture&quot;.

Giuseppe Verdi included &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; in his &quot;&quot; (Hymn of the Nations), composed for the London 1862 International Exhibition.

Benjamin Britten arranged &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; in 1961 for the Leeds Festival. This version has been programmed several times at the Last Night of the Proms.

Charles Ives wrote &quot;Variations on &quot;America&quot;&quot; for organ in 1891 at age seventeen. It included a polytonal section in three simultaneous keys, though this was omitted from performances at his father&#x27;s request, because &quot;it made the boys laugh out loud&quot;. Ives was fond of the rapid pedal line in the final variation, which he said was &quot;almost as much fun as playing baseball&quot;. The piece was not published until 1949; the final version includes an introduction, seven variations and a polytonal interlude. The piece was adapted for orchestra in 1963 by William Schuman. This version became popular during the bicentennial celebrations, and is often heard at pops concerts.

Muthuswami Dikshitar (1776–1835), one of the musical trinity in South Indian classical (Carnatic) music composed some Sanskrit pieces set to Western tunes. These are in the raga Sankarabharanam and are referred to as &quot;. Among these, the composition &quot; is set to the tune of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;.

Sigismond Thalberg (1812–1871), Swiss composer and one of the most famous virtuoso pianists of the 19th century, wrote a fantasia on &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;.

Johan Nepomuk Hummel (1778–1837) wrote &quot;Variations on God Save the King in D major&quot;, Op. 10 and quoted the tune briefly in his &quot;Freudenfest-Ouverture in D major&quot;, S 148.

Jan Ladislav Dussek wrote a set of theme with 5 variations for piano on God Save the King.

Adolphe Blanc wrote a set of variations for piano six hands on this theme.

Ferdinando Carulli used the melody in , for recorder &amp; guitar, Op. 102.

Louis Drouet composed &quot;Variations on the air God save the King&quot; for flute and piano.

Gordon Jacob wrote a choral arrangement of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; with a trumpet fanfare introduction, for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.

===Rock adaptations===
Jimi Hendrix played an impromptu version of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; to open his set at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970. Just before walking onto the stage, he asked &quot;How does it [the anthem] go again?&quot;. Hendrix gave the same sort of distortion and improvisation of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, as he had done with &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at the Woodstock Festival in 1969.

The rock band Queen recorded an instrumental version of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; for their 1975 album &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;. Guitarist Brian May adapted the melody using his distinctive layers of overdubbed electric guitars. This recorded version was played at the end of every Queen concert from the end of 1974 to 1986, while vocalist Freddie Mercury walked around the stage wearing a crown and a cloak on their Magic Tour in 1986. The song was played whilst all the Queen members would take their bows. On 3 June 2002, during the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, Brian May performed the anthem on his Red Special electric guitar for Party at the Palace from the roof of Buckingham Palace which is featured on the 30th Anniversary DVD edition of &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;.

In 1977, the Sex Pistols recorded a song titled &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; in open reference to the National Anthem and the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee celebrations that year, with the song intending to stand for sympathy for the working class and resentment of the monarchy. They were banned from many venues, censored by mainstream media, and reached number 2 on the official U.K. singles charts and number 1 on the NME chart.

A version of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; by Madness features the melody of the song played on kazoos. It was included on the compilation album &quot;The Business – the Definitive Singles Collection&quot;.

=== Computer music ===
The anthem was the first piece of music played on a computer, and the first computer music to be recorded.

Musical notes were first generated by a computer programmed by Alan Turing at the Computing Machine Laboratory of the University of Manchester in 1948. The first music proper, a performance of the National Anthem was programmed by Christopher Strachey on the Mark II Manchester Electronic Computer at same venue, in 1951. Later that year, short extracts of three pieces, the first being the National Anthem, were recorded there by a BBC outside broadcasting unit: the other pieces being &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot;, and &quot;In the Mood&quot;. Researchers at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch restored the acetate master disc in 2016 and the results may be heard on SoundCloud.

=== Use in other media/works ===
The song &quot;I. SHINJI (A-6)&quot; from Neon Genesis Evangelion uses a slightly-altered version of &quot;God Save the King&quot; for its main melody.

==Reception==
The philosopher and reformer Jeremy Bentham praised &quot;God Save the King&quot; in 1796: &quot;the melody recommending itself by beauty to the most polished ears, and by its simplicity to the rudest ear. A song of this complexion, implanted by the habit of half a century in the mass of popular sentiment, can not be refused a place in the inventory of the national blessings.&quot; Ludwig van Beethoven wrote &quot;I have to show the English a little of what a blessing &#x27;God Save the King&#x27; is&quot;.

===Calls for a new national anthem(s)===
There have been calls within the UK for a new national anthem, whether it be for the United Kingdom itself, Britain or England (which all currently use &quot;God Save the King&quot;). There are many reasons people cite for wishing for a new national anthem, such as: from a non-religious standpoint claims of &quot;God Save the King&quot; being long outdated and irrelevant in the 21st century, rejection of odes to promoting war and imperialism and rejection of praising the monarchy from a republican perspective. A further reason is that England has no anthem of its own for sporting contests and the like, whereas Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales have unofficial anthems—&quot;Flower of Scotland&quot;, &quot;Londonderry Air&quot;, and &quot;&quot;—while England tends to use &quot;God Save the King&quot; exclusively and also unofficially.

<doc id="12336" wikidata="Q482999" url="?curid=12336" title="Gladiator">
<text>A gladiator ( , ) was an armed combatant who entertained audiences in the Roman Republic and Roman Empire in violent confrontations with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals. Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their lives and their legal and social standing by appearing in the arena. Most were despised as slaves, schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even in death.

Irrespective of their origin, gladiators offered spectators an example of Rome&#x27;s martial ethics and, in fighting or dying well, they could inspire admiration and popular acclaim. They were celebrated in high and low art, and their value as entertainers was commemorated in precious and commonplace objects throughout the Roman world.

The origin of gladiatorial combat is open to debate. There is evidence of it in funeral rites during the Punic Wars of the 3rd century BC, and thereafter it rapidly became an essential feature of politics and social life in the Roman world. Its popularity led to its use in ever more lavish and costly games.

The gladiator games lasted for nearly a thousand years, reaching their peak between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD.

==History==
===Origins===

Early literary sources seldom agree on the origins of gladiators and the gladiator games. In the late 1st century BC, Nicolaus of Damascus believed they were Etruscan. A generation later, Livy wrote that they were first held in 310 BC by the Campanians in celebration of their victory over the Samnites. Long after the games had ceased, the 7th century AD writer Isidore of Seville derived Latin &quot;&quot; (manager of gladiators) from the Etruscan word for &quot;executioner&quot;, and the title of &quot;Charon&quot; (an official who accompanied the dead from the Roman gladiatorial arena) from Charun, psychopomp of the Etruscan underworld. This was accepted and repeated in most early modern, standard histories of the games.

For some modern scholars, reappraisal of pictorial evidence supports a Campanian origin, or at least a borrowing, for the games and gladiators. Campania hosted the earliest known gladiator schools (&quot;ludi&quot;). Tomb frescoes from the Campanian city of Paestum (4th century BC) show paired fighters, with helmets, spears and shields, in a propitiatory funeral blood-rite that anticipates early Roman gladiator games. Compared to these images, supporting evidence from Etruscan tomb-paintings is tentative and late. The Paestum frescoes may represent the continuation of a much older tradition, acquired or inherited from Greek colonists of the 8th century BC.

Livy places the first Roman gladiator games (264 BC) in the early stage of Rome&#x27;s First Punic War, against Carthage, when Decimus Junius Brutus Scaeva had three gladiator pairs fight to the death in Rome&#x27;s &quot;cattle market&quot; forum (&quot;Forum Boarium&quot;) to honor his dead father, Brutus Pera. Livy describes this as a &quot;munus&quot; (plural: &quot;munera&quot;), a gift, in this case a commemorative duty owed the manes (spirit, or shade) of a dead ancestor by his descendants. The development of the gladiator &quot;munus&quot; and its gladiator types was most strongly influenced by Samnium&#x27;s support for Hannibal and the subsequent punitive expeditions against the Samnites by Rome and its Campanian allies; the earliest, most frequently mentioned and probably most popular type was the Samnite.

To quote Livy:
The war in Samnium, immediately afterwards, was attended with equal danger and an equally glorious conclusion. The enemy, besides their other warlike preparation, had made their battle-line to glitter with new and splendid arms. There were two corps: the shields of the one were inlaid with gold, of the other with silver ... The Romans had already heard of these splendid accoutrements, but their generals had taught them that a soldier should be rough to look on, not adorned with gold and silver but putting his trust in iron and in courage ... The Dictator, as decreed by the senate, celebrated a triumph, in which by far the finest show was afforded by the captured armour. So the Romans made use of the splendid armour of their enemies to do honour to their gods; while the Campanians, in consequence of their pride and in hatred of the Samnites, equipped after this fashion the gladiators who furnished them entertainment at their feasts, and bestowed on them the name Samnites.
Livy&#x27;s account skirts the funereal, sacrificial function of early Roman gladiator combats and reflects the later theatrical ethos of the Roman gladiator show: splendidly, exotically armed and armoured barbarians, treacherous and degenerate, are dominated by Roman iron and native courage. His plain Romans virtuously dedicate the magnificent spoils of war to the gods. Their Campanian allies stage a dinner entertainment using gladiators who may not be Samnites, but play the Samnite role. Other groups and tribes would join the cast list as Roman territories expanded. Most gladiators were armed and armoured in the manner of the enemies of Rome. The gladiator &quot;munus&quot; became a morally instructive form of historic enactment in which the only honourable option for the gladiator was to fight well, or else die well.

===Development===
In 216 BC, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, late consul and augur, was honoured by his sons with three days of &quot;munera gladiatoria&quot; in the Forum Romanum, using twenty-two pairs of gladiators. Ten years later, Scipio Africanus gave a commemorative &quot;munus&quot; in Iberia for his father and uncle, casualties in the Punic Wars. High status non-Romans, and possibly Romans too, volunteered as his gladiators. The context of the Punic Wars and Rome&#x27;s near-disastrous defeat at the Battle of Cannae (216 BC) link these early games to munificence, the celebration of military victory and the religious expiation of military disaster; these &quot;munera&quot; appear to serve a morale-raising agenda in an era of military threat and expansion. The next recorded &quot;munus&quot;, held for the funeral of Publius Licinius in 183 BC, was more extravagant. It involved three days of funeral games, 120 gladiators, and public distribution of meat (&quot;visceratio data&quot;)—a practice that reflected the gladiatorial fights at Campanian banquets described by Livy and later deplored by Silius Italicus.

The enthusiastic adoption of &quot;munera gladiatoria&quot; by Rome&#x27;s Iberian allies shows how easily, and how early, the culture of the gladiator &quot;munus&quot; permeated places far from Rome itself. By 174 BC, &quot;small&quot; Roman &quot;munera&quot; (private or public), provided by an &quot;&quot; of relatively low importance, may have been so commonplace and unremarkable they were not considered worth recording:
Many gladiatorial games were given in that year, some unimportant, one noteworthy beyond the rest—that of Titus Flamininus which he gave to commemorate the death of his father, which lasted four days, and was accompanied by a public distribution of meats, a banquet, and scenic performances. The climax of the show which was big for the time was that in three days seventy four gladiators fought.
In 105 BC, the ruling consuls offered Rome its first taste of state-sponsored &quot;barbarian combat&quot; demonstrated by gladiators from Capua, as part of a training program for the military. It proved immensely popular. Thereafter, the gladiator contests formerly restricted to private &quot;munera&quot; were often included in the state games (&quot;ludi&quot;) that accompanied the major religious festivals. Where traditional &quot;ludi&quot; had been dedicated to a deity, such as Jupiter, the &quot;munera&quot; could be dedicated to an aristocratic sponsor&#x27;s divine or heroic ancestor.

===Peak===

Gladiatorial games offered their sponsors extravagantly expensive but effective opportunities for self-promotion, and gave their clients and potential voters exciting entertainment at little or no cost to themselves. Gladiators became big business for trainers and owners, for politicians on the make and those who had reached the top and wished to stay there. A politically ambitious &quot;privatus&quot; (private citizen) might postpone his deceased father&#x27;s &quot;munus&quot; to the election season, when a generous show might drum up votes; those in power and those seeking it needed the support of the plebeians and their tribunes, whose votes might be won with the mere promise of an exceptionally good show. Sulla, during his term as &quot;praetor&quot;, showed his usual acumen in breaking his own sumptuary laws to give the most lavish &quot;munus&quot; yet seen in Rome, for the funeral of his wife, Metella.

In the closing years of the politically and socially unstable Late Republic, any aristocratic owner of gladiators had political muscle at his disposal. In 65 BC, newly elected &quot;curule aedile&quot; Julius Caesar held games that he justified as &quot;munus&quot; to his father, who had been dead for 20 years. Despite an already enormous personal debt, he used 320 gladiator pairs in silvered armour. He had more available in Capua but the senate, mindful of the recent Spartacus revolt and fearful of Caesar&#x27;s burgeoning private armies and rising popularity, imposed a limit of 320 pairs as the maximum number of gladiators any citizen could keep in Rome. Caesar&#x27;s showmanship was unprecedented in scale and expense; he had staged a &quot;munus&quot; as memorial rather than funeral rite, eroding any practical or meaningful distinction between &quot;munus&quot; and &quot;ludi&quot;.

Gladiatorial games, usually linked with beast shows, spread throughout the republic and beyond. Anti-corruption laws of 65 and 63 BC attempted but failed to curb the political usefulness of the games to their sponsors. Following Caesar&#x27;s assassination and the Roman Civil War, Augustus assumed imperial authority over the games, including &quot;munera&quot;, and formalised their provision as a civic and religious duty. His revision of sumptuary law capped private and public expenditure on &quot;munera&quot;, claiming to save the Roman elite from the bankruptcies they would otherwise suffer, and restricting gladiator &quot;munera&quot; to the festivals of Saturnalia and Quinquatria. Henceforth, an imperial praetor&#x27;s official &quot;munus&quot; was allowed a maximum of 120 gladiators at a ceiling cost of 25,000 denarii; an imperial &quot;ludi&quot; might cost no less than 180,000 denarii. Throughout the empire, the greatest and most celebrated games would now be identified with the state-sponsored imperial cult, which furthered public recognition, respect and approval for the emperor&#x27;s divine &quot;numen&quot;, his laws, and his agents. Between 108 and 109 AD, Trajan celebrated his Dacian victories using a reported 10,000 gladiators and 11,000 animals over 123 days. The cost of gladiators and &quot;munera&quot; continued to spiral out of control. Legislation of 177 AD by Marcus Aurelius did little to stop it, and was completely ignored by his son, Commodus.

===Decline===
The decline of the gladiatorial &quot;munus&quot; was a far from straightforward process. The crisis of the 3rd century imposed increasing military demands on the imperial purse, from which the Roman Empire never quite recovered, and lesser magistrates found their provision of various obligatory &quot;munera&quot; an increasingly unrewarding tax on the doubtful privileges of office. Still, emperors continued to subsidize the games as a matter of undiminished public interest. In the early 3rd century AD, the Christian writer Tertullian condemned the attendance of Christians: the combats, he said, were murder, their witnessing spiritually and morally harmful and the gladiator an instrument of pagan human sacrifice. Carolyn Osiek comments:

The reason, we would suppose, would be primarily the bloodthirsty violence, but his is different: the extent of religious ritual and meaning in them, which constitutes idolatry. Although Tertullian states that these events are forbidden to believers, the fact that he writes a whole treatise to convince Christians that they should not attend (&quot;De Spectaculis&quot;) shows that apparently not everyone agreed to stay away from them.
In the next century, Augustine of Hippo deplored the youthful fascination of his friend (and later fellow-convert and bishop) Alypius of Thagaste, with the &quot;munera&quot; spectacle as inimical to a Christian life and salvation. Amphitheatres continued to host the spectacular administration of Imperial justice: in 315 Constantine the Great condemned child-snatchers &quot;ad bestias&quot; in the arena. Ten years later, he forbade criminals being forced to fight to the death as gladiators:
Bloody spectacles do not please us in civil ease and domestic quiet. For that reason we forbid those people to be gladiators who by reason of some criminal act were accustomed to deserve this condition and sentence. You shall rather sentence them to serve in the mines so that they may acknowledge the penalties of their crimes with blood.

This has been interpreted as a ban on gladiatorial combat. Yet, in the last year of his life, Constantine wrote a letter to the citizens of Hispellum, granting its people the right to celebrate his rule with gladiatorial games.

In 365, Valentinian I (r. 364–375) threatened to fine a judge who sentenced Christians to the arena and in 384 attempted, like most of his predecessors, to limit the expenses of &quot;gladiatora munera&quot;.

In 393, Theodosius I (r. 379–395) adopted Nicene Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire and banned pagan festivals. The &quot;ludi&quot; continued, very gradually shorn of their stubbornly pagan elements. Honorius (r. 395–423) legally ended gladiator games in 399, and again in 404, at least in the Western Roman Empire. According to Theodoret, the ban was in consequence of Saint Telemachus&#x27; martyrdom by spectators at a gladiator &quot;munus.&quot; Valentinian III (r. 425–455) repeated the ban in 438, perhaps effectively, though &quot;venationes&quot; continued beyond 536. By this time, interest in gladiator contests had waned throughout the Roman world. In the Byzantine Empire, theatrical shows and chariot races continued to attract the crowds, and drew a generous imperial subsidy.

==Organisation==
The earliest &quot;munera&quot; took place at or near the tomb of the deceased and these were organised by their &quot;munerator&quot; (who made the offering). Later games were held by an &quot;editor&quot;, either identical with the &quot;munerator&quot; or an official employed by him. As time passed, these titles and meanings may have merged. In the republican era, private citizens could own and train gladiators, or lease them from a &quot;lanista&quot; (owner of a gladiator training school). From the &quot;principate&quot; onwards, private citizens could hold &quot;munera&quot; and own gladiators only with imperial permission, and the role of &quot;editor&quot; was increasingly tied to state officialdom. Legislation by Claudius required that &quot;quaestors&quot;, the lowest rank of Roman magistrate, personally subsidise two-thirds of the costs of games for their small-town communities—in effect, both an advertisement of their personal generosity and a part-purchase of their office. Bigger games were put on by senior magistrates, who could better afford them. The largest and most lavish of all were paid for by the emperor himself.

==The gladiators==
The earliest types of gladiator were named after Rome&#x27;s enemies of that time: the Samnite, Thracian and Gaul. The Samnite, heavily armed, elegantly helmed and probably the most popular type, was renamed secutor and the Gaul renamed murmillo, once these former enemies had been conquered then absorbed into Rome&#x27;s Empire. In the mid-republican &quot;munus&quot;, each type seems to have fought against a similar or identical type. In the later Republic and early Empire, various &quot;fantasy&quot; types were introduced, and were set against dissimilar but complementary types. For example, the bareheaded, nimble retiarius (&quot;net-man&quot;), armoured only at the left arm and shoulder, pitted his net, trident and dagger against the more heavily armoured, helmeted Secutor. Most depictions of gladiators show the most common and popular types. Passing literary references to others has allowed their tentative reconstruction. Other novelties introduced around this time included gladiators who fought from chariots or carts, or from horseback. At an unknown date, cestus fighters were introduced to Roman arenas, probably from Greece, armed with potentially lethal boxing gloves.

The trade in gladiators was empire-wide, and subjected to official supervision. Rome&#x27;s military success produced a supply of soldier-prisoners who were redistributed for use in State mines or amphitheatres and for sale on the open market. For example, in the aftermath of the Jewish Revolt, the gladiator schools received an influx of Jews—those rejected for training were been sent straight to the arenas as &quot;noxii&quot; (lit. ). The best—the most robust—were sent to Rome. In Rome&#x27;s military ethos, enemy soldiers who had surrendered or allowed their own capture and enslavement had been granted an unmerited gift of life. Their training as gladiators gave them the opportunity to redeem their honour in the &quot;munus&quot;.

Two other sources of gladiators, found increasingly during the Principate and the relatively low military activity of the Pax Romana, were slaves condemned to the arena (&quot;damnati&quot;), to gladiator schools or games (&quot;ad ludum gladiatorium&quot;) as punishment for crimes, and the paid volunteers (&quot;&quot;) who by the late Republic may have comprised approximately half—and possibly the most capable half—of all gladiators. The use of volunteers had a precedent in the Iberian &quot;munus&quot; of Scipio Africanus; but none of those had been paid.

For the poor, and for non-citizens, enrollment in a gladiator school offered a trade, regular food, housing of sorts and a fighting chance of fame and fortune. Mark Antony chose a troupe of gladiators to be his personal bodyguard. Gladiators customarily kept their prize money and any gifts they received, and these could be substantial. Tiberius offered several retired gladiators 100,000 &quot;sesterces&quot; each to return to the arena. Nero gave the gladiator Spiculus property and residence &quot;equal to those of men who had celebrated triumphs.&quot;

===Women===

From the 60s AD female gladiators appear as rare and &quot;exotic markers of exceptionally lavish spectacle&quot;. In 66 AD, Nero had Ethiopian women, men and children fight at a &quot;munus&quot; to impress the King Tiridates I of Armenia. Romans seem to have found the idea of a female gladiator novel and entertaining, or downright absurd; Juvenal titillates his readers with a woman named &quot;Mevia&quot;, hunting boars in the arena &quot;with spear in hand and breasts exposed&quot;, and Petronius mocks the pretensions of a rich, low-class citizen, whose &quot;munus&quot; includes a woman fighting from a cart or chariot. A &quot;munus&quot; of 89 AD, during Domitian&#x27;s reign, featured a battle between female gladiators, described as &quot;Amazons&quot;. In Halicarnassus, a 2nd-century AD relief depicts two female combatants named &quot;Amazon&quot; and &quot;Achillia&quot;; their match ended in a draw. In the same century, an epigraph praises one of Ostia&#x27;s local elite as the first to &quot;arm women&quot; in the history of its games. Female gladiators probably submitted to the same regulations and training as their male counterparts. Roman morality required that all gladiators be of the lowest social classes, and emperors who failed to respect this distinction earned the scorn of posterity. Cassius Dio takes pains to point out that when the much admired emperor Titus used female gladiators, they were of acceptably low class.

Some regarded female gladiators of any type or class as a symptom of corrupted Roman appetites, morals and womanhood. Before he became emperor, Septimius Severus may have attended the Antiochene Olympic Games, which had been revived by the emperor Commodus and included traditional Greek female athletics. Septimius&#x27; attempt to give Rome a similarly dignified display of female athletics was met by the crowd with ribald chants and cat-calls. Probably as a result, he banned the use of female gladiators in 200 AD.

===Emperors===
Caligula, Titus, Hadrian, Lucius Verus, Caracalla, Geta and Didius Julianus were all said to have performed in the arena, either in public or private, but risks to themselves were minimal. Claudius, characterised by his historians as morbidly cruel and boorish, fought a whale trapped in the harbor in front of a group of spectators. Commentators invariably disapproved of such performances.

Commodus was a fanatical participant at the &quot;ludi&quot;, and compelled Rome&#x27;s elite to attend his performances as gladiator, &quot;bestiarius&quot; or &quot;venator&quot;. Most of his performances as a gladiator were bloodless affairs, fought with wooden swords; he invariably won. He was said to have restyled Nero&#x27;s colossal statue in his own image as &quot;Hercules Reborn&quot;, dedicated to himself as &quot;Champion of &quot;secutores&quot;; only left-handed fighter to conquer twelve times one thousand men.&quot; He was said to have killed 100 lions in one day, almost certainly from an elevated platform surrounding the arena perimeter, which allowed him to safely demonstrate his marksmanship. On another occasion, he decapitated a running ostrich with a specially designed dart, carried the bloodied head and his sword over to the Senatorial seats and gesticulated as though they were next. As reward for these services, he drew a gigantic stipend from the public purse.

==The games==
===Preparations===

Gladiator games were advertised well beforehand, on billboards that gave the reason for the game, its editor, venue, date and the number of paired gladiators (&quot;ordinarii&quot;) to be used. Other highlighted features could include details of &quot;venationes&quot;, executions, music and any luxuries to be provided for the spectators, such as an awning against the sun, water sprinklers, food, drink, sweets and occasionally &quot;door prizes&quot;. For enthusiasts and gamblers, a more detailed program (&quot;libellus&quot;) was distributed on the day of the &quot;munus&quot;, showing the names, types and match records of gladiator pairs, and their order of appearance. Left-handed gladiators were advertised as a rarity; they were trained to fight right-handers, which gave them an advantage over most opponents and produced an interestingly unorthodox combination.

The night before the &quot;munus&quot;, the gladiators were given a banquet and opportunity to order their personal and private affairs; Futrell notes its similarity to a ritualistic or sacramental &quot;last meal&quot;. These were probably both family and public events which included even the &quot;noxii&quot;, sentenced to die in the arena the following day; and the &quot;damnati&quot;, who would have at least a slender chance of survival. The event may also have been used to drum up more publicity for the imminent game.

===The &quot;ludi&quot; and &quot;munus&quot;===
Official &quot;munera&quot; of the early Imperial era seem to have followed a standard form (&quot;munus legitimum&quot;). A procession (&quot;pompa&quot;) entered the arena, led by lictors who bore the fasces that signified the magistrate-&quot;editor&quot;&#x27;s power over life and death. They were followed by a small band of trumpeters (&quot;tubicines&quot;) playing a fanfare. Images of the gods were carried in to &quot;witness&quot; the proceedings, followed by a scribe to record the outcome, and a man carrying the palm branch used to honour victors. The magistrate &quot;editor&quot; entered among a retinue who carried the arms and armour to be used; the gladiators presumably came in last.

The entertainments often began with &quot;venationes&quot; (beast hunts) and &quot;bestiarii&quot; (beast fighters). Next came the &quot;ludi meridiani&quot;, which were of variable content but usually involved executions of &quot;noxii&quot;, some of whom were condemned to be subjects of fatal re-enactments, based on Greek or Roman myths. Gladiators may have been involved in these as executioners, though most of the crowd, and the gladiators themselves, preferred the &quot;dignity&quot; of an even contest. There were also comedy fights; some may have been lethal. A crude Pompeian graffito suggests a burlesque of musicians, dressed as animals named &quot;Ursus tibicen&quot; (flute-playing bear) and &quot;Pullus cornicen&quot; (horn-blowing chicken), perhaps as accompaniment to clowning by &quot;paegniarii&quot; during a &quot;mock&quot; contest of the &quot;ludi meridiani&quot;.

===Armatures===
The gladiators may have held informal warm-up matches, using blunted or dummy weapons—some &quot;munera&quot;, however, may have used blunted weapons throughout. The &quot;editor,&quot; his representative or an honoured guest would check the weapons (&quot;probatio armorum&quot;) for the scheduled matches. These were the highlight of the day, and were as inventive, varied and novel as the &quot;editor&quot; could afford. Armatures could be very costly—some were flamboyantly decorated with exotic feathers, jewels and precious metals. Increasingly the &quot;munus&quot; was the &quot;editor&quot;&#x27;s gift to spectators who had come to expect the best as their due.
===Combat===
Lightly armed and armoured fighters, such as the retiarius, would tire less rapidly than their heavily armed opponents; most bouts would have lasted 10 to 15 minutes, or 20 minutes at most. In late Republican &quot;munera&quot;, between 10 and 13 matches could have been fought on one day; this assumes one match at a time in the course of an afternoon.

Spectators preferred to watch highly skilled, well matched &quot;ordinarii&quot; with complementary fighting styles; these were the most costly to train and to hire. A general &quot;melee&quot; of several, lower-skilled gladiators was far less costly, but also less popular. Even among the &quot;ordinarii&quot;, match winners might have to fight a new, well-rested opponent, either a &quot;tertiarius&quot; (&quot;third choice gladiator&quot;) by prearrangement; or a &quot;substitute&quot; gladiator (&quot;suppositicius&quot;) who fought at the whim of the &quot;editor&quot; as an unadvertised, unexpected &quot;extra&quot;. This yielded two combats for the cost of three gladiators, rather than four; such contests were prolonged, and in some cases, more bloody. Most were probably of poor quality, but the emperor Caracalla chose to test a notably skilled and successful fighter named Bato against first one &quot;supposicitius&quot;, whom he beat, and then another, who killed him. At the opposite level of the profession, a gladiator reluctant to confront his opponent might be whipped, or goaded with hot irons, until he engaged through sheer desperation.
Combats between experienced, well trained gladiators demonstrated a considerable degree of stagecraft. Among the cognoscenti, bravado and skill in combat were esteemed over mere hacking and bloodshed; some gladiators made their careers and reputation from bloodless victories. Suetonius describes an exceptional &quot;munus&quot; by Nero, in which no-one was killed, &quot;not even &quot;noxii&quot; (enemies of the state).&quot;

Trained gladiators were expected to observe professional rules of combat. Most matches employed a senior referee (&quot;summa rudis&quot;) and an assistant, shown in mosaics with long staffs (&quot;rudes&quot;) to caution or separate opponents at some crucial point in the match. Referees were usually retired gladiators whose decisions, judgement and discretion were, for the most part, respected; they could stop bouts entirely, or pause them to allow the combatants rest, refreshment and a rub-down.

Ludi and &quot;munera&quot; were accompanied by music, played as interludes, or building to a &quot;frenzied crescendo&quot; during combats, perhaps to heighten the suspense during a gladiator&#x27;s appeal; blows may have been accompanied by trumpet-blasts. The Zliten mosaic in Libya (circa 80–100 AD) shows musicians playing an accompaniment to provincial games (with gladiators, &quot;bestiarii&quot;, or &quot;venatores&quot; and prisoners attacked by beasts). Their instruments are a long straight trumpet (&quot;tubicen&quot;), a large curved horn (&quot;Cornu&quot;) and a water organ (&quot;hydraulis&quot;). Similar representations (musicians, gladiators and &quot;bestiari&quot;) are found on a tomb relief in Pompeii.

===Victory and defeat===

A match was won by the gladiator who overcame his opponent, or killed him outright. Victors received the palm branch and an award from the &quot;editor&quot;. An outstanding fighter might receive a laurel crown and money from an appreciative crowd but for anyone originally condemned &quot;ad ludum&quot; the greatest reward was manumission (emancipation), symbolised by the gift of a wooden training sword or staff (&quot;rudis&quot;) from the &quot;editor&quot;. Martial describes a match between Priscus and Verus, who fought so evenly and bravely for so long that when both acknowledged defeat at the same instant, Titus awarded victory and a &quot;rudis&quot; to each. Flamma was awarded the &quot;rudis&quot; four times, but chose to remain a gladiator. His gravestone in Sicily includes his record: &quot;Flamma, &quot;secutor&quot;, lived 30 years, fought 34 times, won 21 times, fought to a draw 9 times, defeated 4 times, a Syrian by nationality. Delicatus made this for his deserving comrade-in-arms.&quot;

A gladiator could acknowledge defeat by raising a finger (&quot;ad digitum&quot;), in appeal to the referee to stop the combat and refer to the &quot;editor&quot;, whose decision would usually rest on the crowd&#x27;s response. In the earliest &quot;munera&quot;, death was considered a righteous penalty for defeat; later, those who fought well might be granted remission at the whim of the crowd or the &quot;editor&quot;. During the Imperial era, matches advertised as &quot;sine missione&quot; (usually understood to mean &quot;without reprieve&quot; for the defeated) suggest that &quot;missio&quot; (the sparing of a defeated gladiator&#x27;s life) had become common practice. The contract between &quot;editor&quot; and his &quot;lanista&quot; could include compensation for unexpected deaths; this could be &quot;some fifty times higher than the lease price&quot; of the gladiator.

Under Augustus&#x27; rule, the demand for gladiators began to exceed supply, and matches &quot;sine missione&quot; were officially banned; an economical, pragmatic development that happened to match popular notions of &quot;natural justice&quot;. When Caligula and Claudius refused to spare defeated but popular fighters, their own popularity suffered. In general, gladiators who fought well were likely to survive. At a Pompeian match between chariot-fighters, Publius Ostorius, with previous 51 wins to his credit, was granted missio after losing to Scylax, with 26 victories. By common custom, the spectators decided whether or not a losing gladiator should be spared, and chose the winner in the rare event of a standing tie. Even more rarely, perhaps uniquely, one stalemate ended in the killing of one gladiator by the &quot;editor&quot; himself. In any event, the final decision of death or life belonged to the &quot;editor&quot;, who signalled his choice with a gesture described by Roman sources as &quot;pollice verso&quot; meaning &quot;with a turned thumb&quot;; a description too imprecise for reconstruction of the gesture or its symbolism. Whether victorious or defeated, a gladiator was bound by oath to accept or implement his editor&#x27;s decision, &quot;the victor being nothing but the instrument of his [editor&#x27;s] will.&quot; Not all &quot;editors&quot; chose to go with the crowd, and not all those condemned to death for putting on a poor show chose to submit:

Once a band of five &quot;retiarii&quot; in tunics, matched against the same number of &quot;secutores&quot;, yielded without a struggle; but when their death was ordered, one of them caught up his trident and slew all the victors. Caligula bewailed this in a public proclamation as a most cruel murder.
===Death and disposal===
A gladiator who was refused &quot;missio&quot; was despatched by his opponent. To die well, a gladiator should never ask for mercy, nor cry out. A &quot;good death&quot; redeemed the gladiator from the dishonourable weakness and passivity of defeat, and provided a noble example to those who watched:
For death, when it stands near us, gives even to inexperienced men the courage not to seek to avoid the inevitable. So the gladiator, no matter how faint-hearted he has been throughout the fight, offers his throat to his opponent and directs the wavering blade to the vital spot. (Seneca. &quot;Epistles&quot;, 30.8)

Some mosaics show defeated gladiators kneeling in preparation for the moment of death. Seneca&#x27;s &quot;vital spot&quot; seems to have meant the neck. Gladiator remains from Ephesus confirm this.

The body of a gladiator who had died well was placed on a couch of Libitina and removed with dignity to the arena morgue, where the corpse was stripped of armour, and probably had its throat cut as confirmation of death. The Christian author Tertullian, commenting on &quot;ludi meridiani&quot; in Roman Carthage during the peak era of the games, describes a more humiliating method of removal. One arena official, dressed as the &quot;brother of Jove&quot;, Dis Pater (god of the underworld) strikes the corpse with a mallet. Another, dressed as Mercury, tests for life-signs with a heated &quot;wand&quot;; once confirmed as dead, the body is dragged from the arena.

Whether these victims were gladiators or &quot;noxii&quot; is unknown. Modern pathological examination confirms the probably fatal use of a mallet on some, but not all the gladiator skulls found in a gladiators&#x27; cemetery. Kyle (1998) proposes that gladiators who disgraced themselves might have been subjected to the same indignities as &quot;noxii&quot;, denied the relative mercies of a quick death and dragged from the arena as carrion. Whether the corpse of such a gladiator could be redeemed from further ignominy by friends or &quot;familia&quot; is not known.

The bodies of &quot;noxii&quot;, and possibly some &quot;damnati&quot;, were thrown into rivers or dumped unburied; Denial of funeral rites and memorial condemned the shade (&quot;manes&quot;) of the deceased to restless wandering upon the earth as a dreadful &quot;larva&quot; or &quot;lemur&quot;. Ordinary citizens, slaves and freedmen were usually buried beyond the town or city limits, to avoid the ritual and physical pollution of the living; professional gladiators had their own, separate cemeteries. The taint of &quot;infamia&quot; was perpetual.
===Remembrance and epitaphs===
Gladiators could subscribe to a union (&quot;collegia&quot;), which ensured their proper burial, and sometimes a pension or compensation for wives and children. Otherwise, the gladiator&#x27;s &quot;familia&quot;, which included his &quot;lanista&quot;, comrades and blood-kin, might fund his funeral and memorial costs, and use the memorial to assert their moral reputation as responsible, respectful colleagues or family members. Some monuments record the gladiator&#x27;s career in some detail, including the number of appearances, victories—sometimes represented by an engraved crown or wreath—defeats, career duration, and age at death. Some include the gladiator&#x27;s type, in words or direct representation: for example, the memorial of a retiarius at Verona included the engraving of a trident and sword. A wealthy editor might commission artwork to celebrate a particularly successful or memorable show, and include named portraits of winners and losers in action; the Borghese Gladiator Mosaic is a notable example. According to Cassius Dio, the emperor Caracalla gave the gladiator Bato a magnificent memorial and State funeral; more typical are the simple gladiator tombs of the Eastern Roman Empire, whose brief inscriptions include the following:

&quot;The familia set this up in memory of Saturnilos.&quot;
&quot;For Nikepharos, son of Synetos, Lakedaimonian, and for Narcissus the secutor. Titus Flavius Satyrus set up this monument in his memory from his own money.&quot;
&quot;For Hermes. Paitraeites with his cell-mates set this up in memory&quot;.
Very little evidence survives of the religious beliefs of gladiators as a class, or their expectations of an afterlife. Modern scholarship offers little support for the once-prevalent notion that gladiators, &quot;venatores&quot; and &quot;bestiarii&quot; were personally or professionally dedicated to the cult of the Graeco-Roman goddess Nemesis. Rather, she seems to have represented a kind of &quot;Imperial Fortuna&quot; who dispensed Imperial retribution on the one hand, and Imperially subsidised gifts on the other—including the &quot;munera&quot;. One gladiator&#x27;s tomb dedication clearly states that her decisions are not to be trusted. Many gladiator epitaphs claim Nemesis, fate, deception or treachery as the instrument of their death, never the superior skills of the flesh-and-blood adversary who defeated and killed them. Having no personal responsibility for his own defeat and death, the losing gladiator remains the better man, worth avenging.

&quot;I, Victor, left-handed, lie here, but my homeland was in Thessalonica. Doom killed me, not the liar Pinnas. No longer let him boast. I had a fellow gladiator, Polyneikes, who killed Pinnas and avenged me. Claudius Thallus set up this memorial from what I left behind as a legacy.&quot;
===Life expectancy===

A gladiator might expect to fight in two or three &quot;munera&quot; annually, and an unknown number would have died in their first match. Few gladiators survived more than 10 contests, though one survived an extraordinary 150 bouts; and another died at 90 years of age, presumably long after retirement. A natural death following retirement is also likely for three individuals who died at 38, 45, and 48 years respectively. George Ville, using evidence from 1st century gladiator headstones, calculated an average age at death of 27, and mortality &quot;among all who entered the arena&quot; at 19/100. Marcus Junkelmann disputes Ville&#x27;s calculation for average age at death; the majority would have received no headstone, and would have died early in their careers, at 18–25 years of age. Between the early and later Imperial periods the risk of death for defeated gladiators rose from 1/5 to 1/4, perhaps because &quot;missio&quot; was granted less often. Hopkins and Beard tentatively estimate a total of 400 arenas throughout the Roman Empire at its greatest extent, with a combined total of 8,000 deaths per annum from executions, combats and accidents.

==Schools and training==
The earliest named gladiator school (singular: &quot;ludus&quot;; plural: &quot;ludi&quot;) is that of Aurelius Scaurus at Capua. He was &quot;lanista&quot; of the gladiators employed by the state circa 105 BC to instruct the legions and simultaneously entertain the public. Few other &quot;lanistae&quot; are known by name: they headed their &quot;familia gladiatoria&quot;, and had lawful power over life and death of every family member, including &quot;servi poenae&quot;, &quot;auctorati&quot; and ancillaries. Socially, they were &quot;infames&quot;, on a footing with pimps and butchers and despised as price gougers. No such stigma was attached to a gladiator owner (&quot;munerarius&quot; or &quot;editor&quot;) of good family, high status and independent means; Cicero congratulated his friend Atticus on buying a splendid troop—if he rented them out, he might recover their entire cost after two performances.

The Spartacus revolt had originated in a gladiator school privately owned by Lentulus Batiatus, and had been suppressed only after a protracted series of costly, sometimes disastrous campaigns by regular Roman troops. In the late Republican era, a fear of similar uprisings, the usefulness of gladiator schools in creating private armies, and the exploitation of &quot;munera&quot; for political gain led to increased restrictions on gladiator school ownership, siting and organisation. By Domitian&#x27;s time, many had been more or less absorbed by the State, including those at Pergamum, Alexandria, Praeneste and Capua. The city of Rome itself had four; the &quot;Ludus Magnus&quot; (the largest and most important, housing up to about 2,000 gladiators), &quot;Ludus Dacicus&quot;, &quot;Ludus Gallicus&quot;, and the &quot;Ludus Matutinus&quot;, which trained &quot;bestiarii&quot;.

In the Imperial era, volunteers required a magistrate&#x27;s permission to join a school as &quot;auctorati&quot;. If this was granted, the school&#x27;s physician assessed their suitability. Their contract (&quot;auctoramentum&quot;) stipulated how often they were to perform, their fighting style and earnings. A condemned bankrupt or debtor accepted as novice (&quot;novicius&quot;) could negotiate with his &quot;lanista&quot; or &quot;editor&quot; for the partial or complete payment of his debt. Faced with runaway re-enlistment fees for skilled &quot;auctorati&quot;, Marcus Aurelius set their upper limit at 12,000 &quot;sesterces&quot;.

All prospective gladiators, whether volunteer or condemned, were bound to service by a sacred oath (&quot;sacramentum&quot;). Novices (&quot;novicii&quot;) trained under teachers of particular fighting styles, probably retired gladiators. They could ascend through a hierarchy of grades (singular: &quot;palus&quot;) in which &quot;primus palus&quot; was the highest. Lethal weapons were prohibited in the schools—weighted, blunt wooden versions were probably used. Fighting styles were probably learned through constant rehearsal as choreographed &quot;numbers&quot;. An elegant, economical style was preferred. Training included preparation for a stoical, unflinching death. Successful training required intense commitment.

Those condemned &quot;ad ludum&quot; were probably branded or marked with a tattoo (&quot;stigma&quot;, plural &quot;stigmata&quot;) on the face, legs and/or hands. These &quot;stigmata&quot; may have been text—slaves were sometimes thus marked on the forehead until Constantine banned the use of facial stigmata in 325 AD. Soldiers were routinely marked on the hand.

Gladiators were typically accommodated in cells, arranged in barrack formation around a central practice arena. Juvenal describes the segregation of gladiators according to type and status, suggestive of rigid hierarchies within the schools: &quot;even the lowest scum of the arena observe this rule; even in prison they&#x27;re separate&quot;. &quot;Retiarii&quot; were kept away from &quot;damnati&quot;, and &quot;fag targeteers&quot; from &quot;armoured heavies&quot;. As most &quot;ordinarii&quot; at games were from the same school, this kept potential opponents separate and safe from each other until the lawful &quot;munus&quot;. Discipline could be extreme, even lethal. Remains of a Pompeian &quot;ludus&quot; site attest to developments in supply, demand and discipline; in its earliest phase, the building could accommodate 15–20 gladiators. Its replacement could have housed about 100 and included a very small cell, probably for lesser punishments and so low that standing was impossible.

===Diet and medical care===

Despite the harsh discipline, gladiators represented a substantial investment for their &quot;lanista&quot; and were otherwise well fed and cared for. Their daily, high-energy, vegetarian diet consisted of barley, boiled beans, oatmeal, ash and dried fruit. Gladiators were sometimes called &quot;hordearii&quot; (eaters of barley). Romans considered barley inferior to wheat—a punishment for legionaries replaced their wheat ration with it—but it was thought to strengthen the body. Regular massage and high quality medical care helped mitigate an otherwise very severe training regimen. Part of Galen&#x27;s medical training was at a gladiator school in Pergamum where he saw (and would later criticise) the training, diet, and long-term health prospects of the gladiators.

==Legal and social status==

&quot;He vows to endure to be burned, to be bound, to be beaten, and to be killed by the sword.&quot; &quot;The gladiator&#x27;s oath as cited by Petronius (Satyricon, 117).&quot;
Modern customs and institutions offer few useful parallels to the legal and social context of the &quot;gladiatoria munera&quot;. In Roman law, anyone condemned to the arena or the gladiator schools (&quot;damnati ad ludum&quot;) was a &quot;servus poenae&quot; (slave of the penalty), and was considered to be under sentence of death unless manumitted. A rescript of Hadrian reminded magistrates that &quot;those sentenced to the sword&quot; (execution) should be despatched immediately &quot;or at least within the year&quot;, and those sentenced to the &quot;ludi&quot; should not be discharged before five years, or three years if granted manumission. Only slaves found guilty of specific offences could be sentenced to the arena; however, citizens found guilty of particular offenses could be stripped of citizenship, formally enslaved, then sentenced; and slaves, once freed, could be legally reverted to slavery for certain offences. Arena punishment could be given for banditry, theft and arson, and for treasons such as rebellion, census evasion to avoid paying due taxes and refusal to swear lawful oaths.

Offenders seen as particularly obnoxious to the state (&quot;noxii&quot;) received the most humiliating punishments. By the 1st century BC, &quot;noxii&quot; were being condemned to the beasts (&quot;damnati ad bestias&quot;) in the arena, with almost no chance of survival, or were made to kill each other. From the early Imperial era, some were forced to participate in humiliating and novel forms of mythological or historical enactment, culminating in their execution. Those judged less harshly might be condemned &quot;ad ludum venatorium&quot; or &quot;ad gladiatorium&quot;—combat with animals or gladiators—and armed as thought appropriate. These &quot;damnati&quot; at least might put on a good show and retrieve some respect and, very rarely, survive to fight another day. Some may even have become &quot;proper&quot; gladiators.

Among the most admired and skilled &quot;auctorati&quot; were those who, having been granted manumission, volunteered to fight in the arena. Some of these highly trained and experienced specialists may have had no other practical choice open to them. Their legal status—slave or free—is uncertain. Under Roman law, a freed gladiator could not &quot;offer such services [as those of a gladiator] after manumission, because they cannot be performed without endangering [his] life.&quot; All contracted volunteers, including those of equestrian and senatorial class, were legally enslaved by their &quot;auctoratio&quot; because it involved their potentially lethal submission to a master. All &quot;arenarii&quot; (those who appeared in the arena) were &quot;&quot;infames&quot; by reputation&quot;, a form of social dishonour which excluded them from most of the advantages and rights of citizenship. Payment for such appearances compounded their &quot;infamia&quot;. The legal and social status of even the most popular and wealthy &quot;auctorati&quot; was thus marginal at best. They could not vote, plead in court nor leave a will; and unless they were manumitted, their lives and property belonged to their masters. Nevertheless, there is evidence of informal if not entirely lawful practices to the contrary. Some &quot;unfree&quot; gladiators bequeathed money and personal property to wives and children, possibly via a sympathetic owner or &quot;familia&quot;; some had their own slaves and gave them their freedom. One gladiator was even granted &quot;citizenship&quot; to several Greek cities of the Eastern Roman world.

Caesar&#x27;s &quot;munus&quot; of 46 BC included at least one equestrian, son of a Praetor, and two volunteers of possible senatorial rank. Augustus, who enjoyed watching the games, forbade the participation of senators, equestrians and their descendants as fighters or &quot;arenarii&quot;, but in 11 AD he bent his own rules and allowed equestrians to volunteer because &quot;the prohibition was no use&quot;. Under Tiberius, the Larinum decree (19 AD) reiterated Augustus&#x27; original prohibitions. Thereafter, Caligula flouted them and Claudius strengthened them. Nero and Commodus ignored them. Even after the adoption of Christianity as Rome&#x27;s official religion, legislation forbade the involvement of Rome&#x27;s upper social classes in the games, though not the games themselves. Throughout Rome&#x27;s history, some volunteers were prepared to risk loss of status or reputation by appearing in the arena, whether for payment, glory or, as in one recorded case, to revenge an affront to their personal honour. In one extraordinary episode, an aristocratic descendant of the Gracchi, already infamous for his marriage, as a bride, to a male horn player, appeared in what may have been a non-lethal or farcical match. His motives are unknown, but his voluntary and &quot;shameless&quot; arena appearance combined the &quot;womanly attire&quot; of a lowly &quot;retiarius tunicatus&quot;, adorned with golden ribbons, with the apex headdress that marked him out as a priest of Mars. In Juvenal&#x27;s account, he seems to have relished the scandalous self-display, applause and the disgrace he inflicted on his more sturdy opponent by repeatedly skipping away from the confrontation.

==Amphitheatres==

As &quot;munera&quot; grew larger and more popular, open spaces such as the Forum Romanum were adapted (as the Forum Boarium had been) as venues in Rome and elsewhere, with temporary, elevated seating for the patron and high status spectators; they were popular but not truly public events:

A show of gladiators was to be exhibited before the people in the market-place, and most of the magistrates erected scaffolds round about, with an intention of letting them for advantage. Caius commanded them to take down their scaffolds, that the poor people might see the sport without paying anything. But nobody obeying these orders of his, he gathered together a body of labourers, who worked for him, and overthrew all the scaffolds the very night before the contest was to take place. So that by the next morning the market-place was cleared, and the common people had an opportunity of seeing the pastime. In this, the populace thought he had acted the part of a man; but he much disobliged the tribunes his colleagues, who regarded it as a piece of violent and presumptuous interference.

Towards the end of the Republic, Cicero (&quot;Murena&quot;, 72–73) still describes gladiator shows as ticketed—their political usefulness was served by inviting the rural tribunes of the plebs, not the people of Rome &quot;en masse&quot;–but in Imperial times, poor citizens in receipt of the corn dole were allocated at least some free seating, possibly by lottery. Others had to pay. Ticket scalpers (&quot;Locarii&quot;) sometimes sold or let out seats at inflated prices. Martial wrote that &quot;Hermes [a gladiator who always drew the crowds] means riches for the ticket scalpers&quot;.

The earliest known Roman amphitheatre was built at Pompeii by Sullan colonists, around 70 BC. The first in the city of Rome was the extraordinary wooden amphitheatre of Gaius Scribonius Curio (built in 53 BC). The first part-stone amphitheatre in Rome was inaugurated in 29–30 BC, in time for the triple triumph of Octavian (later Augustus). Shortly after it burned down in 64 AD, Vespasian began its replacement, later known as the Amphitheatrum Flavium (Colosseum), which seated 50,000 spectators and would remain the largest in the Empire. It was inaugurated by Titus in 80 AD as the personal gift of the Emperor to the people of Rome, paid for by the imperial share of booty after the Jewish Revolt.

Amphitheatres were usually oval in plan. Their seating tiers surrounded the arena below, where the community&#x27;s judgments were meted out, in full public view. From across the stands, crowd and &quot;editor&quot; could assess each other&#x27;s character and temperament. For the crowd, amphitheatres afforded unique opportunities for free expression and free speech (&quot;theatralis licentia&quot;). Petitions could be submitted to the &quot;editor&quot; (as magistrate) in full view of the community. &quot;Factiones&quot; and claques could vent their spleen on each other, and occasionally on Emperors. The emperor Titus&#x27;s dignified yet confident ease in his management of an amphitheatre crowd and its factions were taken as a measure of his enormous popularity and the rightness of his imperium. The amphitheatre &quot;munus&quot; thus served the Roman community as living theatre and a court in miniature, in which judgement could be served not only on those in the arena below, but on their judges. Amphitheatres also provided a means of social control. Their seating was &quot;disorderly and indiscriminate&quot; until Augustus prescribed its arrangement in his Social Reforms. To persuade the Senate, he expressed his distress on behalf of a senator who could not find seating at a crowded games in Puteoli:
In consequence of this the senate decreed that, whenever any public show was given anywhere, the first row of seats should be reserved for senators; and at Rome he would not allow the envoys of the free and allied nations to sit in the orchestra, since he was informed that even freedmen were sometimes appointed. He separated the soldiery from the people. He assigned special seats to the married men of the commons, to boys under age their own section and the adjoining one to their preceptors; and he decreed that no one wearing a dark cloak should sit in the middle of the house. He would not allow women to view even the gladiators except from the upper seats, though it had been the custom for men and women to sit together at such shows. Only the Vestal virgins were assigned a place to themselves, opposite the praetor&#x27;s tribunal.
These arrangements do not seem to have been strongly enforced.

===Factions and rivals===
Popular factions supported favourite gladiators and gladiator types. Under Augustan legislation, the Samnite type was renamed &quot;Secutor&quot; (&quot;chaser&quot;, or &quot;pursuer&quot;). The secutor was equipped with a long, heavy &quot;large&quot; shield called a &quot;scutum&quot;; &quot;Secutores&quot;, their supporters and any heavyweight &quot;secutor&quot;-based types such as the Murmillo were &quot;secutarii&quot;. Lighter types, such as the Thraex, were equipped with a smaller, lighter shield called a &quot;parma&quot;, from which they and their supporters were named &quot;parmularii&quot; (&quot;small shields&quot;). Titus and Trajan preferred the &quot;parmularii&quot; and Domitian the &quot;secutarii&quot;; Marcus Aurelius took neither side. Nero seems to have enjoyed the brawls between rowdy, enthusiastic and sometimes violent factions, but called in the troops if they went too far.

There were also local rivalries. At Pompeii&#x27;s amphitheatre, during Nero&#x27;s reign, the trading of insults between Pompeians and Nucerian spectators during public &quot;ludi&quot; led to stone throwing and riot. Many were killed or wounded. Nero banned gladiator &quot;munera&quot; (though not the games) at Pompeii for ten years as punishment. The story is told in Pompeian graffiti and high quality wall painting, with much boasting of Pompeii&#x27;s &quot;victory&quot; over Nuceria.

==Role in Roman life==
It is not known how many &quot;gladiatoria munera&quot; were given throughout the Roman period. Many, if not most, involved &quot;venationes&quot;, and in the later empire some may have been only that. In 165 BC, at least one &quot;munus&quot; was held during April&#x27;s Megalesia. In the early imperial era, &quot;munera&quot; in Pompeii and neighbouring towns were dispersed from March through November. They included a provincial magnate&#x27;s five-day &quot;munus&quot; of thirty pairs, plus beast hunts. A single late primary source, the &quot;Calendar of Furius Dionysius Philocalus&quot; for 354, shows how seldom gladiators featured among a multitude of official festivals. Of the 176 days reserved for spectacles of various kinds, 102 were for theatrical shows, 64 for chariot races and just 10 in December for gladiator games and &quot;venationes&quot;. A century before this, the emperor Alexander Severus (r. 222–235) may have intended a more even redistribution of &quot;munera&quot; throughout the year; but this would have broken with what had become the traditional positioning of the major gladiator games, at the year&#x27;s ending. As Wiedemann points out, December was also the month for the Saturnalia, Saturn&#x27;s festival, in which death was linked to renewal, and the lowest were honoured as the highest.

===Role in the military===
According to Livy: &quot;A man who knows how to conquer in war is a man who knows how to arrange a banquet and put on a show.&quot;

Rome was essentially a landowning military aristocracy. From the early days of the Republic, ten years of military service were a citizen&#x27;s duty and a prerequisite for election to public office. &quot;Devotio&quot; (willingness to sacrifice one&#x27;s life to the greater good) was central to the Roman military ideal, and was the core of the Roman military oath. It applied from highest to lowest alike in the chain of command. As a soldier committed his life (voluntarily, at least in theory) to the greater cause of Rome&#x27;s victory, he was not expected to survive defeat.

The Punic Wars of the late 3rd century BC—in particular the near-catastrophic defeat of Roman arms at Cannae—had long-lasting effects on the Republic, its citizen armies, and the development of the gladiatorial &quot;munera&quot;. In the aftermath of Cannae, Scipio Africanus crucified Roman deserters and had non-Roman deserters thrown to the beasts. The Senate refused to ransom Hannibal&#x27;s Roman captives: instead, they consulted the Sibylline books, then made drastic preparations:
In obedience to the Books of Destiny, some strange and unusual sacrifices were made, human sacrifices amongst them. A Gaulish man and a Gaulish woman and a Greek man and a Greek woman were buried alive under the Forum Boarium ... They were lowered into a stone vault, which had on a previous occasion also been polluted by human victims, a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings. When the gods were believed to be duly propitiated ... Armour, weapons, and other things of the kind were ordered to be in readiness, and the ancient spoils gathered from the enemy were taken down from the temples and colonnades. The dearth of freemen necessitated a new kind of enlistment; 8,000 sturdy youths from amongst the slaves were armed at the public cost, after they had each been asked whether they were willing to serve or no. These soldiers were preferred, as there would be an opportunity of ransoming them when taken prisoners at a lower price.
The account notes, uncomfortably, the bloodless human sacrifices performed to help turn the tide of the war in Rome&#x27;s favour. While the Senate mustered their willing slaves, Hannibal offered his dishonoured Roman captives a chance for honourable death, in what Livy describes as something very like the Roman &quot;munus&quot;. The &quot;munus&quot; thus represented an essentially military, self-sacrificial ideal, taken to extreme fulfillment in the gladiator&#x27;s oath. By the &quot;devotio&quot; of a voluntary oath, a slave might achieve the quality of a Roman (&quot;Romanitas&quot;), become the embodiment of true &quot;virtus&quot; (manliness, or manly virtue), and paradoxically, be granted &quot;missio&quot; while remaining a slave. The gladiator as a specialist fighter, and the ethos and organization of the gladiator schools, would inform the development of the Roman military as the most effective force of its time. Following defeat at the Battle of Arausio in 105 BC:
...weapons training was given to soldiers by P. Rutilius, consul with C. Mallis. For he, following the example of no previous general, with teachers summoned from the gladiatorial training school of C. Aurelus Scaurus, implanted in the legions a more sophisticated method of avoiding and dealing a blow and mixed bravery with skill and skill back again with virtue so that skill became stronger by bravery&#x27;s passion and passion became more wary with the knowledge of this art.
The military were great aficionados of the games, and supervised the schools. Many schools and amphitheatres were sited at or near military barracks, and some provincial army units owned gladiator troupes. As the Republic wore on, the term of military service increased from ten to the sixteen years formalised by Augustus in the Principate. It would rise to twenty, and later, to twenty-five years. Roman military discipline was ferocious; severe enough to provoke mutiny, despite the consequences. A career as a volunteer gladiator may have seemed an attractive option for some.

In AD 69, the Year of the Four Emperors, Otho&#x27;s troops at Bedriacum included 2000 gladiators. Opposite him on the field, Vitellius&#x27;s army was swollen by levies of slaves, plebs and gladiators. In 167 AD, troop depletions by plague and desertion may have prompted Marcus Aurelius to draft gladiators at his own expense. During the Civil Wars that led to the Principate, Octavian (later Augustus) acquired the personal gladiator troop of his erstwhile opponent, Mark Antony. They had served their late master with exemplary loyalty but thereafter, they disappear from the record.

===Religion, ethics and sentiment===
Roman writing as a whole demonstrates a deep ambivalence towards the &quot;gladiatoria munera&quot;. Even the most complex and sophisticated &quot;munera&quot; of the Imperial era evoked the ancient, ancestral &quot;dii manes&quot; of the underworld and were framed by the protective, lawful rites of &quot;sacrificium&quot;. Their popularity made their co-option by the state inevitable; Cicero acknowledged their sponsorship as a political imperative. Despite the popular adulation of gladiators, they were set apart, despised; and despite Cicero&#x27;s contempt for the mob, he shared their admiration: &quot;Even when [gladiators] have been felled, let alone when they are standing and fighting, they never disgrace themselves. And suppose a gladiator has been brought to the ground, when do you ever see one twist his neck away after he has been ordered to extend it for the death blow?&quot; His own death would later emulate this example. Yet, Cicero could also refer to his popularist opponent Clodius, publicly and scathingly, as a &quot;bustuarius&quot;—literally, a &quot;funeral-man&quot;, implying that Clodius has shown the moral temperament of the lowest sort of gladiator. &quot;Gladiator&quot; could be (and was) used as an insult throughout the Roman period, and &quot;Samnite&quot; doubled the insult, despite the popularity of the Samnite type.

Silius Italicus wrote, as the games approached their peak, that the degenerate Campanians had devised the very worst of precedents, which now threatened the moral fabric of Rome: &quot;It was their custom to enliven their banquets with bloodshed and to combine with their feasting the horrid sight of armed men [(Samnites)] fighting; often the combatants fell dead above the very cups of the revelers, and the tables were stained with streams of blood. Thus demoralised was Capua.&quot; Death could be rightly meted out as punishment, or met with equanimity in peace or war, as a gift of fate; but when inflicted as entertainment, with no underlying moral or religious purpose, it could only pollute and demean those who witnessed it.

The &quot;munus&quot; itself could be interpreted as pious necessity, but its increasing luxury corroded Roman virtue, and created an un-Roman appetite for profligacy and self-indulgence. Caesar&#x27;s 46 BC &quot;ludi&quot; were mere entertainment for political gain, a waste of lives and of money that would have been better doled out to his legionary veterans. Yet for Seneca, and for Marcus Aurelius—both professed Stoics—the degradation of gladiators in the &quot;munus&quot; highlighted their Stoic virtues: their unconditional obedience to their master and to fate, and equanimity in the face of death. Having &quot;neither hope nor illusions&quot;, the gladiator could transcend his own debased nature, and disempower death itself by meeting it face to face. Courage, dignity, altruism and loyalty were morally redemptive; Lucian idealised this principle in his story of Sisinnes, who voluntarily fought as a gladiator, earned 10,000 drachmas and used it to buy freedom for his friend, Toxaris. Seneca had a lower opinion of the mob&#x27;s un-Stoical appetite for &quot;ludi meridiani&quot;: &quot;Man [is]...now slaughtered for jest and sport; and those whom it used to be unholy to train for the purpose of inflicting and enduring wounds are thrust forth exposed and defenceless.&quot;

These accounts seek a higher moral meaning from the &quot;munus&quot;, but Ovid&#x27;s very detailed (though satirical) instructions for seduction in the amphitheatre suggest that the spectacles could generate a potent and dangerously sexual atmosphere. Augustan seating prescriptions placed women—excepting the Vestals, who were legally inviolate—as far as possible from the action of the arena floor; or tried to. There remained the thrilling possibility of clandestine sexual transgression by high-caste spectators and their heroes of the arena. Such assignations were a source for gossip and satire but some became unforgivably public:
What was the youthful charm that so fired Eppia? What hooked her? What did she see in him to make her put up with being called &quot;the gladiator&#x27;s moll&quot;? Her poppet, her Sergius, was no chicken, with a dud arm that prompted hope of early retirement. Besides his face looked a proper mess, helmet-scarred, a great wart on his nose, an unpleasant discharge always trickling from one eye. But he was a gladiator. That word makes the whole breed seem handsome, and made her prefer him to her children and country, her sister, her husband. Steel is what they fall in love with.
Eppia—a senator&#x27;s wife–and her Sergius eloped to Egypt, where he deserted her. Most gladiators would have aimed lower. Two wall &quot;graffiti&quot; in Pompeii describe Celadus the Thraex as &quot;the sigh of the girls&quot; and &quot;the glory of the girls&quot;—which may or may not have been Celadus&#x27; own wishful thinking.

In the later Imperial era, Servius Maurus Honoratus uses the same disparaging term as Cicero—&quot;bustuarius&quot;—for gladiators. Tertullian used it somewhat differently—all victims of the arena were sacrificial in his eyes—and expressed the paradox of the &quot;arenarii&quot; as a class, from a Christian viewpoint:
On the one and the same account they glorify them and they degrade and diminish them; yes, further, they openly condemn them to disgrace and civil degradation; they keep them religiously excluded from council chamber, rostrum, senate, knighthood, and every other kind of office and a good many distinctions. The perversity of it! They love whom they lower; they despise whom they approve; the art they glorify, the artist they disgrace.
=== In Roman art and culture ===

In this new Play, I attempted to follow the old custom of mine, of making a fresh trial; I brought it on again. In the first Act I pleased; when in the meantime a rumor spread that gladiators were about to be exhibited; the populace flock together, make a tumult, clamor aloud, and fight for their places: meantime, I was unable to maintain my place.
Images of gladiators were found throughout the Republic and Empire, among all classes. Walls in the 2nd century BC &quot;Agora of the Italians&quot; at Delos were decorated with paintings of gladiators. Mosaics dating from the 2nd through 4th centuries AD have been invaluable in the reconstruction of combat and its rules, gladiator types and the development of the &quot;munus&quot;. Throughout the Roman world, ceramics, lamps, gems and jewellery, mosaics, reliefs, wall paintings and statuary offer evidence, sometimes the best evidence, of the clothing, props, equipment, names, events, prevalence and rules of gladiatorial combat. Earlier periods provide only occasional, perhaps exceptional examples. The Gladiator Mosaic in the Galleria Borghese displays several gladiator types, and the Bignor Roman Villa mosaic from Provincial Britain shows Cupids as gladiators. Souvenir ceramics were produced depicting named gladiators in combat; similar images of higher quality, were available on more expensive articles in high quality ceramic, glass or silver.

Some of the best preserved gladiator graffiti are from Pompeii and Herculaneum, in public areas including Pompeii&#x27;s Forum and amphitheater, and in the private residences of the upper, middle and lower classes. They clearly show how gladiator &quot;munera&quot; pervaded Pompeiian culture; they provide information pertaining to particular gladiators, and sometimes include their names, status as slaves or freeborn volunteers, and their match records.

Pliny the Elder gives vivid examples of the popularity of gladiator portraiture in Antium and an artistic treat laid on by an adoptive aristocrat for the solidly plebeian citizens of the Roman Aventine:
When a freedman of Nero was giving a gladiatorial show at Antium, the public porticoes were covered with paintings, so we are told, containing life-like portraits of all the gladiators and assistants. This portraiture of gladiators has been the highest interest in art for many centuries now, but it was Gaius Terentius who began the practice of having pictures made of gladiatorial shows and exhibited in public; in honour of his grandfather who had adopted him he provided thirty pairs of Gladiators in the Forum for three consecutive days, and exhibited a picture of the matches in the Grove of Diana.
==Modern reconstructions==

Some Roman reenactors attempt to recreate Roman gladiator troupes. Some of these groups are part of larger Roman reenactment groups, and others are wholly independent, though they might participate in larger demonstrations of Roman reenacting or historical reenacting in general. These groups usually focus on portraying mock gladiatorial combat in as accurate a manner as possible.

<text>A genetically modified organism (GMO) is any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. The exact definition of a genetically modified organism and what constitutes genetic engineering varies, with the most common being an organism altered in a way that &quot;does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination&quot;. A wide variety of organisms have been genetically modified (GM), including animals, plants, and microorganisms.

Genetic modification can include the introduction of new genes or enhancing, altering, or knocking out endogenous genes. In some genetic modifications, genes are transferred within the same species, across species (creating transgenic organisms), and even across kingdoms. Creating a genetically modified organism is a multi-step process. Genetic engineers must isolate the gene they wish to insert into the host organism and combine it with other genetic elements, including a promoter and terminator region and often a selectable marker. A number of techniques are available for inserting the isolated gene into the host genome. Recent advancements using genome editing techniques, notably CRISPR, have made the production of GMOs much simpler. Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen made the first genetically modified organism in 1973, a bacterium resistant to the antibiotic kanamycin. The first genetically modified animal, a mouse, was created in 1974 by Rudolf Jaenisch, and the first plant was produced in 1983. In 1994, the Flavr Savr tomato was released, the first commercialized genetically modified food. The first genetically modified animal to be commercialized was the GloFish (2003) and the first genetically modified animal to be approved for food use was the AquAdvantage salmon in 2015.

Bacteria are the easiest organisms to engineer and have been used for research, food production, industrial protein purification (including drugs), agriculture, and art. There is potential to use them for environmental purposes or as medicine. Fungi have been engineered with much the same goals. Viruses play an important role as vectors for inserting genetic information into other organisms. This use is especially relevant to human gene therapy. There are proposals to remove the virulent genes from viruses to create vaccines. Plants have been engineered for scientific research, to create new colors in plants, deliver vaccines, and to create enhanced crops. Genetically modified crops are publicly the most controversial GMOs, in spite of having the most human health and environmental benefits. Animals are generally much harder to transform and the vast majority are still at the research stage. Mammals are the best model organisms for humans. Livestock is modified with the intention of improving economically important traits such as growth rate, quality of meat, milk composition, disease resistance, and survival. Genetically modified fish are used for scientific research, as pets, and as a food source. Genetic engineering has been proposed as a way to control mosquitos, a vector for many deadly diseases. Although human gene therapy is still relatively new, it has been used to treat genetic disorders such as severe combined immunodeficiency and Leber&#x27;s congenital amaurosis.

Many objections have been raised over the development of GMOs, particularly their commercialization. Many of these involve GM crops and whether food produced from them is safe and what impact growing them will have on the environment. Other concerns are the objectivity and rigor of regulatory authorities, contamination of non-genetically modified food, control of the food supply, patenting of life, and the use of intellectual property rights. Although there is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, GM food safety is a leading issue with critics. Gene flow, impact on non-target organisms, and escape are the major environmental concerns. Countries have adopted regulatory measures to deal with these concerns. There are differences in the regulation for the release of GMOs between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the US and Europe. Key issues concerning regulators include whether GM food should be labeled and the status of gene-edited organisms.

== Definition ==
The definition of a genetically modified organism (GMO) is not clear and varies widely between countries, international bodies, and other communities. At its broadest, the definition of a GMO can include anything that has had its genes altered, including by nature. Taking a less broad view, it can encompass every organism that has had its genes altered by humans, which would include all crops and livestock. In 1993, the &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot; defined genetic engineering as &quot;any of a wide range of techniques ... among them artificial insemination, &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &#x27;test-tube&#x27; babies), sperm banks, cloning, and gene manipulation.&quot; The European Union (EU) included a similarly broad definition in early reviews, specifically mentioning GMOs being produced by &quot;selective breeding and other means of artificial selection&quot; These definitions were promptly adjusted with a number of exceptions added as the result of pressure from scientific and farming communities, as well as developments in science. The EU definition later excluded traditional breeding, in vitro fertilization, induction of polyploidy, mutation breeding, and cell fusion techniques that do not use recombinant nucleic acids or a genetically modified organism in the process.

Another approach was the definition provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Health Organization, and the European Commission, stating that the organisms must be altered in a way that does &quot;not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination&quot;. Progress in science, such as the discovery of horizontal gene transfer being a relatively common natural phenomenon, further added to the confusion on what &quot;occurs naturally&quot;, which led to further adjustments and exceptions. There are examples of crops that fit this definition, but are not normally considered GMOs. For example, the grain crop triticale was fully developed in a laboratory in 1930 using various techniques to alter its genome.

Genetically engineered organism (GEO) can be considered a more precise term compared to GMO when describing organisms&#x27; genomes that have been directly manipulated with biotechnology. The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety used the synonym &quot;living modified organism&quot; (&quot;LMO&quot;) in 2000 and defined it as &quot;any living organism that possesses a novel combination of genetic material obtained through the use of modern biotechnology.&quot; Modern biotechnology is further defined as &quot;In vitro nucleic acid techniques, including recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and direct injection of nucleic acid into cells or organelles, or fusion of cells beyond the taxonomic family.&quot;

Originally, the term GMO was not commonly used by scientists to describe genetically engineered organisms until after usage of GMO became common in popular media. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) considers GMOs to be plants or animals with heritable changes introduced by genetic engineering or traditional methods, while GEO specifically refers to organisms with genes introduced, eliminated, or rearranged using molecular biology, particularly recombinant DNA techniques, such as transgenesis.

The definitions focus on the process more than the product, which means there could be GMOS and non-GMOs with very similar genotypes and phenotypes. This has led scientists to label it as a scientifically meaningless category, saying that it is impossible to group all the different types of GMOs under one common definition. It has also caused issues for organic institutions and groups looking to ban GMOs. It also poses problems as new processes are developed. The current definitions came in before genome editing became popular and there is some confusion as to whether they are GMOs. The EU has adjudged that they are changing their GMO definition to include &quot;organisms obtained by mutagenesis&quot;, but has excluded them from regulation based on their &quot;long safety record&quot; and that they have been &quot;conventionally been used in a number of applications&quot;. In contrast the USDA has ruled that gene edited organisms are not considered GMOs.

Even greater inconsistency and confusion is associated with various &quot;Non-GMO&quot; or &quot;GMO-free&quot; labeling schemes in food marketing, where even products such as water or salt, which do not contain any organic substances and genetic material (and thus cannot be genetically modified by definition), are being labeled to create an impression of being &quot;more healthy&quot;.

== Production ==

Creating a genetically modified organism (GMO) is a multi-step process. Genetic engineers must isolate the gene they wish to insert into the host organism. This gene can be taken from a cell or artificially synthesized. If the chosen gene or the donor organism&#x27;s genome has been well studied it may already be accessible from a genetic library. The gene is then combined with other genetic elements, including a promoter and terminator region and a selectable marker.

A number of techniques are available for inserting the isolated gene into the host genome. Bacteria can be induced to take up foreign DNA, usually by exposed heat shock or electroporation. DNA is generally inserted into animal cells using microinjection, where it can be injected through the cell&#x27;s nuclear envelope directly into the nucleus, or through the use of viral vectors. In plants the DNA is often inserted using &quot;Agrobacterium&quot;-mediated recombination, biolistics or electroporation.

As only a single cell is transformed with genetic material, the organism must be regenerated from that single cell. In plants this is accomplished through tissue culture. In animals it is necessary to ensure that the inserted DNA is present in the embryonic stem cells. Further testing using PCR, Southern hybridization, and DNA sequencing is conducted to confirm that an organism contains the new gene.

Traditionally the new genetic material was inserted randomly within the host genome. Gene targeting techniques, which creates double-stranded breaks and takes advantage on the cells natural homologous recombination repair systems, have been developed to target insertion to exact locations. Genome editing uses artificially engineered nucleases that create breaks at specific points. There are four families of engineered nucleases: meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the Cas9-guideRNA system (adapted from CRISPR). TALEN and CRISPR are the two most commonly used and each has its own advantages. TALENs have greater target specificity, while CRISPR is easier to design and more efficient.

== History ==
Humans have domesticated plants and animals since around 12,000 BCE, using selective breeding or artificial selection (as contrasted with natural selection). The process of selective breeding, in which organisms with desired traits (and thus with the desired genes) are used to breed the next generation and organisms lacking the trait are not bred, is a precursor to the modern concept of genetic modification. Various advancements in genetics allowed humans to directly alter the DNA and therefore genes of organisms. In 1972, Paul Berg created the first recombinant DNA molecule when he combined DNA from a monkey virus with that of the lambda virus.

Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen made the first genetically modified organism in 1973. They took a gene from a bacterium that provided resistance to the antibiotic kanamycin, inserted it into a plasmid and then induced other bacteria to incorporate the plasmid. The bacteria that had successfully incorporated the plasmid was then able to survive in the presence of kanamycin. Boyer and Cohen expressed other genes in bacteria. This included genes from the toad &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; in 1974, creating the first GMO expressing a gene from an organism of a different kingdom.
In 1974, Rudolf Jaenisch created a transgenic mouse by introducing foreign DNA into its embryo, making it the world&#x27;s first transgenic animal. However it took another eight years before transgenic mice were developed that passed the transgene to their offspring. Genetically modified mice were created in 1984 that carried cloned oncogenes, predisposing them to developing cancer. Mice with genes removed (termed a knockout mouse) were created in 1989. The first transgenic livestock were produced in 1985 and the first animal to synthesize transgenic proteins in their milk were mice in 1987. The mice were engineered to produce human tissue plasminogen activator, a protein involved in breaking down blood clots.

In 1983, the first genetically engineered plant was developed by Michael W. Bevan, Richard B. Flavell and Mary-Dell Chilton. They infected tobacco with &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; transformed with an antibiotic resistance gene and through tissue culture techniques were able to grow a new plant containing the resistance gene. The gene gun was invented in 1987, allowing transformation of plants not susceptible to &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; infection. In 2000, Vitamin A-enriched golden rice was the first plant developed with increased nutrient value.

In 1976, Genentech, the first genetic engineering company was founded by Herbert Boyer and Robert Swanson; a year later, the company produced a human protein (somatostatin) in &quot;E. coli&quot;. Genentech announced the production of genetically engineered human insulin in 1978. The insulin produced by bacteria, branded Humulin, was approved for release by the Food and Drug Administration in 1982. In 1988, the first human antibodies were produced in plants. In 1987, a strain of &quot;Pseudomonas syringae&quot; became the first genetically modified organism to be released into the environment when a strawberry and potato field in California were sprayed with it.

The first genetically modified crop, an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant, was produced in 1982. China was the first country to commercialize transgenic plants, introducing a virus-resistant tobacco in 1992. In 1994, Calgene attained approval to commercially release the Flavr Savr tomato, the first genetically modified food. Also in 1994, the European Union approved tobacco engineered to be resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil, making it the first genetically engineered crop commercialized in Europe. An insect resistant Potato was approved for release in the US in 1995, and by 1996 approval had been granted to commercially grow 8 transgenic crops and one flower crop (carnation) in 6 countries plus the EU.

In 2010, scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute announced that they had created the first synthetic bacterial genome. They named it Synthia and it was the world&#x27;s first synthetic life form.

The first genetically modified animal to be commercialized was the GloFish, a Zebra fish with a fluorescent gene added that allows it to glow in the dark under ultraviolet light. It was released to the US market in 2003. In 2015, AquAdvantage salmon became the first genetically modified animal to be approved for food use. Approval is for fish raised in Panama and sold in the US. The salmon were transformed with a growth hormone-regulating gene from a Pacific Chinook salmon and a promoter from an ocean pout enabling it to grow year-round instead of only during spring and summer.

== Bacteria ==

Bacteria were the first organisms to be genetically modified in the laboratory, due to the relative ease of modifying their chromosomes. This ease made them important tools for the creation of other GMOs. Genes and other genetic information from a wide range of organisms can be added to a plasmid and inserted into bacteria for storage and modification. Bacteria are cheap, easy to grow, clonal, multiply quickly and can be stored at −80 °C almost indefinitely. Once a gene is isolated it can be stored inside the bacteria, providing an unlimited supply for research. A large number of custom plasmids make manipulating DNA extracted from bacteria relatively easy.

Their ease of use has made them great tools for scientists looking to study gene function and evolution. The simplest model organisms come from bacteria, with most of our early understanding of molecular biology coming from studying &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. Scientists can easily manipulate and combine genes within the bacteria to create novel or disrupted proteins and observe the effect this has on various molecular systems. Researchers have combined the genes from bacteria and archaea, leading to insights on how these two diverged in the past. In the field of synthetic biology, they have been used to test various synthetic approaches, from synthesizing genomes to creating novel nucleotides.

Bacteria have been used in the production of food for a long time, and specific strains have been developed and selected for that work on an industrial scale. They can be used to produce enzymes, amino acids, flavorings, and other compounds used in food production. With the advent of genetic engineering, new genetic changes can easily be introduced into these bacteria. Most food-producing bacteria are lactic acid bacteria, and this is where the majority of research into genetically engineering food-producing bacteria has gone. The bacteria can be modified to operate more efficiently, reduce toxic byproduct production, increase output, create improved compounds, and remove unnecessary pathways. Food products from genetically modified bacteria include alpha-amylase, which converts starch to simple sugars, chymosin, which clots milk protein for cheese making, and pectinesterase, which improves fruit juice clarity. The majority are produced in the US and even though regulations are in place to allow production in Europe, as of 2015 no food products derived from bacteria are currently available there.

Genetically modified bacteria are used to produce large amounts of proteins for industrial use. The bacteria are generally grown to a large volume before the gene encoding the protein is activated. The bacteria are then harvested and the desired protein purified from them. The high cost of extraction and purification has meant that only high value products have been produced at an industrial scale. The majority of these products are human proteins for use in medicine. Many of these proteins are impossible or difficult to obtain via natural methods and they are less likely to be contaminated with pathogens, making them safer. The first medicinal use of GM bacteria was to produce the protein insulin to treat diabetes. Other medicines produced include clotting factors to treat hemophilia, human growth hormone to treat various forms of dwarfism, interferon to treat some cancers, erythropoietin for anemic patients, and tissue plasminogen activator which dissolves blood clots. Outside of medicine they have been used to produce biofuels. There is interest in developing an extracellular expression system within the bacteria to reduce costs and make the production of more products economical.

With a greater understanding of the role that the microbiome plays in human health, there is a potential to treat diseases by genetically altering the bacteria to, themselves, be therapeutic agents. Ideas include altering gut bacteria so they destroy harmful bacteria, or using bacteria to replace or increase deficient enzymes or proteins. One research focus is to modify &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;, bacteria that naturally provide some protection against HIV, with genes that will further enhance this protection. If the bacteria do not form colonies inside the patient, the person must repeatedly ingest the modified bacteria in order to get the required doses. Enabling the bacteria to form a colony could provide a more long-term solution, but could also raise safety concerns as interactions between bacteria and the human body are less well understood than with traditional drugs. There are concerns that horizontal gene transfer to other bacteria could have unknown effects. As of 2018 there are clinical trials underway testing the efficacy and safety of these treatments.

For over a century, bacteria have been used in agriculture. Crops have been inoculated with Rhizobia (and more recently &quot;Azospirillum&quot;) to increase their production or to allow them to be grown outside their original habitat. Application of &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; (Bt) and other bacteria can help protect crops from insect infestation and plant diseases. With advances in genetic engineering, these bacteria have been manipulated for increased efficiency and expanded host range. Markers have also been added to aid in tracing the spread of the bacteria. The bacteria that naturally colonize certain crops have also been modified, in some cases to express the Bt genes responsible for pest resistance. &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; strains of bacteria cause frost damage by nucleating water into ice crystals around themselves. This led to the development of ice-minus bacteria, which have the ice-forming genes removed. When applied to crops they can compete with the non-modified bacteria and confer some frost resistance.
Other uses for genetically modified bacteria include bioremediation, where the bacteria are used to convert pollutants into a less toxic form. Genetic engineering can increase the levels of the enzymes used to degrade a toxin or to make the bacteria more stable under environmental conditions. Bioart has also been created using genetically modified bacteria. In the 1980s artist Jon Davis and geneticist Dana Boyd converted the Germanic symbol for femininity (ᛉ) into binary code and then into a DNA sequence, which was then expressed in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. This was taken a step further in 2012, when a whole book was encoded onto DNA. Paintings have also been produced using bacteria transformed with fluorescent proteins.

== Viruses ==

Viruses are often modified so they can be used as vectors for inserting genetic information into other organisms. This process is called transduction and if successful the recipient of the introduced DNA becomes a GMO. Different viruses have different efficiencies and capabilities. Researchers can use this to control for various factors; including the target location, insert size, and duration of gene expression. Any dangerous sequences inherent in the virus must be removed, while those that allow the gene to be delivered effectively are retained.

While viral vectors can be used to insert DNA into almost any organism it is especially relevant for its potential in treating human disease. Although primarily still at trial stages, there has been some successes using gene therapy to replace defective genes. This is most evident in curing patients with severe combined immunodeficiency rising from adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID), although the development of leukemia in some ADA-SCID patients along with the death of Jesse Gelsinger in a 1999 trial set back the development of this approach for many years. In 2009, another breakthrough was achieved when an eight-year-old boy with Leber&#x27;s congenital amaurosis regained normal eyesight and in 2016 GlaxoSmithKline gained approval to commercialize a gene therapy treatment for ADA-SCID. As of 2018, there are a substantial number of clinical trials underway, including treatments for hemophilia, glioblastoma, chronic granulomatous disease, cystic fibrosis and various cancers.

The most common virus used for gene delivery comes from adenoviruses as they can carry up to 7.5 kb of foreign DNA and infect a relatively broad range of host cells, although they have been known to elicit immune responses in the host and only provide short term expression. Other common vectors are adeno-associated viruses, which have lower toxicity and longer-term expression, but can only carry about 4kb of DNA. Herpes simplex viruses make promising vectors, having a carrying capacity of over 30kb and providing long term expression, although they are less efficient at gene delivery than other vectors. The best vectors for long term integration of the gene into the host genome are retroviruses, but their propensity for random integration is problematic. Lentiviruses are a part of the same family as retroviruses with the advantage of infecting both dividing and non-dividing cells, whereas retroviruses only target dividing cells. Other viruses that have been used as vectors include alphaviruses, flaviviruses, measles viruses, rhabdoviruses, Newcastle disease virus, poxviruses, and picornaviruses.

Most vaccines consist of viruses that have been attenuated, disabled, weakened or killed in some way so that their virulent properties are no longer effective. Genetic engineering could theoretically be used to create viruses with the virulent genes removed. This does not affect the viruses infectivity, invokes a natural immune response and there is no chance that they will regain their virulence function, which can occur with some other vaccines. As such they are generally considered safer and more efficient than conventional vaccines, although concerns remain over non-target infection, potential side effects and horizontal gene transfer to other viruses. Another potential approach is to use vectors to create novel vaccines for diseases that have no vaccines available or the vaccines that do not work effectively, such as AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The most effective vaccine against Tuberculosis, the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine, only provides partial protection. A modified vaccine expressing &quot;a M tuberculosis&quot; antigen is able to enhance BCG protection. It has been shown to be safe to use at phase II trials, although not as effective as initially hoped. Other vector-based vaccines have already been approved and many more are being developed.

Another potential use of genetically modified viruses is to alter them so they can directly treat diseases. This can be through expression of protective proteins or by directly targeting infected cells. In 2004, researchers reported that a genetically modified virus that exploits the selfish behavior of cancer cells might offer an alternative way of killing tumours. Since then, several researchers have developed genetically modified oncolytic viruses that show promise as treatments for various types of cancer. In 2017, researchers genetically modified a virus to express spinach defensin proteins. The virus was injected into orange trees to combat citrus greening disease that had reduced orange production by 70% since 2005.

Natural viral diseases, such as myxomatosis and rabbit hemorrhagic disease, have been used to help control pest populations. Over time the surviving pests become resistant, leading researchers to look at alternative methods. Genetically modified viruses that make the target animals infertile through immunocontraception have been created in the laboratory as well as others that target the developmental stage of the animal. There are concerns with using this approach regarding virus containment and cross species infection. Sometimes the same virus can be modified for contrasting purposes. Genetic modification of the myxoma virus has been proposed to conserve European wild rabbits in the Iberian peninsula and to help regulate them in Australia. To protect the Iberian species from viral diseases, the myxoma virus was genetically modified to immunize the rabbits, while in Australia the same myxoma virus was genetically modified to lower fertility in the Australian rabbit population.

Outside of biology scientists have used a genetically modified virus to construct a lithium-ion battery and other nanostructured materials. It is possible to engineer bacteriophages to express modified proteins on their surface and join them up in specific patterns (a technique called phage display). These structures have potential uses for energy storage and generation, biosensing and tissue regeneration with some new materials currently produced including quantum dots, liquid crystals, nanorings and nanofibres. The battery was made by engineering M13 bacteriaophages so they would coat themselves in iron phosphate and then assemble themselves along a carbon nanotube. This created a highly conductive medium for use in a cathode, allowing energy to be transferred quickly. They could be constructed at lower temperatures with non-toxic chemicals, making them more environmentally friendly.

== Fungi ==
Fungi can be used for many of the same processes as bacteria. For industrial applications, yeasts combine the bacterial advantages of being a single-celled organism that is easy to manipulate and grow with the advanced protein modifications found in eukaryotes. They can be used to produce large complex molecules for use in food, pharmaceuticals, hormones, and steroids. Yeast is important for wine production and as of 2016 two genetically modified yeasts involved in the fermentation of wine have been commercialized in the United States and Canada. One has increased malolactic fermentation efficiency, while the other prevents the production of dangerous ethyl carbamate compounds during fermentation. There have also been advances in the production of biofuel from genetically modified fungi.

Fungi, being the most common pathogens of insects, make attractive biopesticides. Unlike bacteria and viruses they have the advantage of infecting the insects by contact alone, although they are out competed in efficiency by chemical pesticides. Genetic engineering can improve virulence, usually by adding more virulent proteins, increasing infection rate or enhancing spore persistence. Many of the disease carrying vectors are susceptible to entomopathogenic fungi. An attractive target for biological control are mosquitos, vectors for a range of deadly diseases, including malaria, yellow fever and dengue fever. Mosquitos can evolve quickly so it becomes a balancing act of killing them before the &quot;Plasmodium&quot; they carry becomes the infectious disease, but not so fast that they become resistant to the fungi. By genetically engineering fungi like &quot;Metarhizium anisopliae&quot; and &quot;Beauveria bassiana&quot; to delay the development of mosquito infectiousness the selection pressure to evolve resistance is reduced. Another strategy is to add proteins to the fungi that block transmission of malaria or remove the &quot;Plasmodium&quot; altogether.

&quot;Agaricus bisporus&quot; the common white button mushroom, has been gene edited to resist browning, giving it a longer shelf life. The process used CRISPR to knock out a gene that encodes polyphenol oxidase. As it didn&#x27;t introduce any foreign DNA into the organism it was not deemed to be regulated under existing GMO frameworks and as such is the first CRISPR-edited organism to be approved for release. This has intensified debates as to whether gene-edited organisms should be considered genetically modified organisms and how they should be regulated.

== Plants ==
Plants have been engineered for scientific research, to display new flower colors, deliver vaccines, and to create enhanced crops. Many plants are pluripotent, meaning that a single cell from a mature plant can be harvested and under the right conditions can develop into a new plant. This ability can be taken advantage of by genetic engineers; by selecting for cells that have been successfully transformed in an adult plant a new plant can then be grown that contains the transgene in every cell through a process known as tissue culture.

Much of the advances in the field of genetic engineering has come from experimentation with tobacco. Major advances in tissue culture and plant cellular mechanisms for a wide range of plants has originated from systems developed in tobacco. It was the first plant to be altered using genetic engineering and is considered a model organism for not only genetic engineering, but a range of other fields. As such the transgenic tools and procedures are well established making tobacco one of the easiest plants to transform. Another major model organism relevant to genetic engineering is &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;. Its small genome and short life cycle makes it easy to manipulate and it contains many homologs to important crop species. It was the first plant sequenced, has a host of online resources available and can be transformed by simply dipping a flower in a transformed &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; solution.

In research, plants are engineered to help discover the functions of certain genes. The simplest way to do this is to remove the gene and see what phenotype develops compared to the wild type form. Any differences are possibly the result of the missing gene. Unlike mutagenisis, genetic engineering allows targeted removal without disrupting other genes in the organism. Some genes are only expressed in certain tissues, so reporter genes, like GUS, can be attached to the gene of interest allowing visualization of the location. Other ways to test a gene is to alter it slightly and then return it to the plant and see if it still has the same effect on phenotype. Other strategies include attaching the gene to a strong promoter and see what happens when it is overexpressed, forcing a gene to be expressed in a different location or at different developmental stages.

Some genetically modified plants are purely ornamental. They are modified for flower color, fragrance, flower shape and plant architecture. The first genetically modified ornamentals commercialized altered color. Carnations were released in 1997, with the most popular genetically modified organism, a blue rose (actually lavender or mauve) created in 2004. The roses are sold in Japan, the United States, and Canada. Other genetically modified ornamentals include &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot; and &quot;Petunia&quot;. As well as increasing aesthetic value there are plans to develop ornamentals that use less water or are resistant to the cold, which would allow them to be grown outside their natural environments.

It has been proposed to genetically modify some plant species threatened by extinction to be resistant to invasive plants and diseases, such as the emerald ash borer in North American and the fungal disease, &quot;Ceratocystis platani&quot;, in European plane trees. The papaya ringspot virus devastated papaya trees in Hawaii in the twentieth century until transgenic papaya plants were given pathogen-derived resistance. However, genetic modification for conservation in plants remains mainly speculative. A unique concern is that a transgenic species may no longer bear enough resemblance to the original species to truly claim that the original species is being conserved. Instead, the transgenic species may be genetically different enough to be considered a new species, thus diminishing the conservation worth of genetic modification.

=== Crops ===

Genetically modified crops are genetically modified plants that are used in agriculture. The first crops developed were used for animal or human food and provide resistance to certain pests, diseases, environmental conditions, spoilage or chemical treatments (e.g. resistance to a herbicide). The second generation of crops aimed to improve the quality, often by altering the nutrient profile. Third generation genetically modified crops could be used for non-food purposes, including the production of pharmaceutical agents, biofuels, and other industrially useful goods, as well as for bioremediation.

There are three main aims to agricultural advancement; increased production, improved conditions for agricultural workers and sustainability. GM crops contribute by improving harvests through reducing insect pressure, increasing nutrient value and tolerating different abiotic stresses. Despite this potential, as of 2018, the commercialized crops are limited mostly to cash crops like cotton, soybean, maize and canola and the vast majority of the introduced traits provide either herbicide tolerance or insect resistance. Soybeans accounted for half of all genetically modified crops planted in 2014. Adoption by farmers has been rapid, between 1996 and 2013, the total surface area of land cultivated with GM crops increased by a factor of 100. Geographically though the spread has been uneven, with strong growth in the Americas and parts of Asia and little in Europe and Africa. Its socioeconomic spread has been more even, with approximately 54% of worldwide GM crops grown in developing countries in 2013. Although doubts have been raised, most studies have found growing GM crops to be beneficial to farmers through decreased pesticide use as well as increased crop yield and farm profit.

The majority of GM crops have been modified to be resistant to selected herbicides, usually a glyphosate or glufosinate based one. Genetically modified crops engineered to resist herbicides are now more available than conventionally bred resistant varieties; in the USA 93% of soybeans and most of the GM maize grown is glyphosate tolerant. Most currently available genes used to engineer insect resistance come from the &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; bacterium and code for delta endotoxins. A few use the genes that encode for vegetative insecticidal proteins. The only gene commercially used to provide insect protection that does not originate from &quot;B. thuringiensis&quot; is the Cowpea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI was first approved for use cotton in 1999 and is currently undergoing trials in rice. Less than one percent of GM crops contained other traits, which include providing virus resistance, delaying senescence and altering the plants composition.

Golden rice is the most well known GM crop that is aimed at increasing nutrient value. It has been engineered with three genes that biosynthesise beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, in the edible parts of rice. It is intended to produce a fortified food to be grown and consumed in areas with a shortage of dietary vitamin A, a deficiency which each year is estimated to kill 670,000 children under the age of 5 and cause an additional 500,000 cases of irreversible childhood blindness. The original golden rice produced 1.6μg/g of the carotenoids, with further development increasing this 23 times. It gained its first approvals for use as food in 2018.

Plants and plant cells have been genetically engineered for production of biopharmaceuticals in bioreactors, a process known as pharming. Work has been done with duckweed &quot;Lemna minor&quot;, the algae &quot;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&quot; and the moss &quot;Physcomitrella patens&quot;. Biopharmaceuticals produced include cytokines, hormones, antibodies, enzymes and vaccines, most of which are accumulated in the plant seeds. Many drugs also contain natural plant ingredients and the pathways that lead to their production have been genetically altered or transferred to other plant species to produce greater volume. Other options for bioreactors are biopolymers and biofuels. Unlike bacteria, plants can modify the proteins post-translationally, allowing them to make more complex molecules. They also pose less risk of being contaminated. Therapeutics have been cultured in transgenic carrot and tobacco cells, including a drug treatment for Gaucher&#x27;s disease.

Vaccine production and storage has great potential in transgenic plants. Vaccines are expensive to produce, transport, and administer, so having a system that could produce them locally would allow greater access to poorer and developing areas. As well as purifying vaccines expressed in plants it is also possible to produce edible vaccines in plants. Edible vaccines stimulate the immune system when ingested to protect against certain diseases. Being stored in plants reduces the long-term cost as they can be disseminated without the need for cold storage, don&#x27;t need to be purified, and have long term stability. Also being housed within plant cells provides some protection from the gut acids upon digestion. However the cost of developing, regulating, and containing transgenic plants is high, leading to most current plant-based vaccine development being applied to veterinary medicine, where the controls are not as strict.

Genetically modified crops have been proposed as one of the ways to reduce farming-related emissions due to higher yield, reduced use of pesticides, reduced use of tractor fuel and no tillage. According to a 2021 study, in EU alone widespread adoption of GE crops would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 33 million tons of equivalent or 7.5% of total farming-related emissions.

== Animals ==

The vast majority of genetically modified animals are at the research stage with the number close to entering the market remaining small. As of 2018 only three genetically modified animals have been approved, all in the USA. A goat and a chicken have been engineered to produce medicines and a salmon has increased its own growth. Despite the differences and difficulties in modifying them, the end aims are much the same as for plants. GM animals are created for research purposes, production of industrial or therapeutic products, agricultural uses, or improving their health. There is also a market for creating genetically modified pets.

=== Mammals ===


The process of genetically engineering mammals is slow, tedious, and expensive. However, new technologies are making genetic modifications easier and more precise. The first transgenic mammals were produced by injecting viral DNA into embryos and then implanting the embryos in females. The embryo would develop and it would be hoped that some of the genetic material would be incorporated into the reproductive cells. Then researchers would have to wait until the animal reached breeding age and then offspring would be screened for the presence of the gene in every cell. The development of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system as a cheap and fast way of directly modifying germ cells, effectively halving the amount of time needed to develop genetically modified mammals.

Mammals are the best models for human disease, making genetic engineered ones vital to the discovery and development of cures and treatments for many serious diseases. Knocking out genes responsible for human genetic disorders allows researchers to study the mechanism of the disease and to test possible cures. Genetically modified mice have been the most common mammals used in biomedical research, as they are cheap and easy to manipulate. Pigs are also a good target as they have a similar body size and anatomical features, physiology, pathophysiological response and diet. Nonhuman primates are the most similar model organisms to humans, but there is less public acceptance towards using them as research animals. In 2009, scientists announced that they had successfully transferred a gene into a primate species (marmosets) for the first time. Their first research target for these marmosets was Parkinson&#x27;s disease, but they were also considering amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington&#x27;s disease.

Human proteins expressed in mammals are more likely to be similar to their natural counterparts than those expressed in plants or microorganisms. Stable expression has been accomplished in sheep, pigs, rats and other animals. In 2009, the first human biological drug produced from such an animal, a goat, was approved. The drug, ATryn, is an anticoagulant which reduces the probability of blood clots during surgery or childbirth and is extracted from the goat&#x27;s milk. Human alpha-1-antitrypsin is another protein that has been produced from goats and is used in treating humans with this deficiency. Another medicinal area is in creating pigs with greater capacity for human organ transplants (xenotransplantation). Pigs have been genetically modified so that their organs can no longer carry retroviruses or have modifications to reduce the chance of rejection. Chimeric pigs could carry fully human organs. The first human transplant of a genetically modified pig heart occurred in 2023, and kidney in 2024.&lt;ref name=&quot;3/21/24nyt&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;3/21/24CNN&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Livestock are modified with the intention of improving economically important traits such as growth-rate, quality of meat, milk composition, disease resistance and survival. Animals have been engineered to grow faster, be healthier and resist diseases. Modifications have also improved the wool production of sheep and udder health of cows. Goats have been genetically engineered to produce milk with strong spiderweb-like silk proteins in their milk. A GM pig called Enviropig was created with the capability of digesting plant phosphorus more efficiently than conventional pigs. They could reduce water pollution since they excrete 30 to 70% less phosphorus in manure. Dairy cows have been genetically engineered to produce milk that would be the same as human breast milk. This could potentially benefit mothers who cannot produce breast milk but want their children to have breast milk rather than formula. Researchers have also developed a genetically engineered cow that produces allergy-free milk.

Scientists have genetically engineered several organisms, including some mammals, to include green fluorescent protein (GFP), for research purposes. GFP and other similar reporting genes allow easy visualization and localization of the products of the genetic modification. Fluorescent pigs have been bred to study human organ transplants, regenerating ocular photoreceptor cells, and other topics. In 2011, green-fluorescent cats were created to help find therapies for HIV/AIDS and other diseases as feline immunodeficiency virus is related to HIV.

There have been suggestions that genetic engineering could be used to bring animals back from extinction. It involves changing the genome of a close living relative to resemble the extinct one and is currently being attempted with the passenger pigeon. Genes associated with the woolly mammoth have been added to the genome of an African Elephant, although the lead researcher says he has no intention of creating live elephants and transferring all the genes and reversing years of genetic evolution is a long way from being feasible. It is more likely that scientists could use this technology to conserve endangered animals by bringing back lost diversity or transferring evolved genetic advantages from adapted organisms to those that are struggling.

==== Humans ====
Gene therapy uses genetically modified viruses to deliver genes which can cure disease in humans. Although gene therapy is still relatively new, it has had some successes. It has been used to treat genetic disorders such as severe combined immunodeficiency, and Leber&#x27;s congenital amaurosis. Treatments are also being developed for a range of other currently incurable diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, cancer, diabetes, heart disease and muscular dystrophy. These treatments only effect somatic cells, meaning any changes would not be inheritable. Germline gene therapy results in any change being inheritable, which has raised concerns within the scientific community.

In 2015, CRISPR was used to edit the DNA of non-viable human embryos. In November 2018, He Jiankui announced that he had edited the genomes of two human embryos, in an attempt to disable the &quot;CCR5&quot; gene, which codes for a receptor that HIV uses to enter cells. He said that twin girls, Lulu and Nana, had been born a few weeks earlier and that they carried functional copies of CCR5 along with disabled CCR5 (mosaicism) and were still vulnerable to HIV. The work was widely condemned as unethical, dangerous, and premature.

=== Fish ===

Genetically modified fish are used for scientific research, as pets and as a food source. Aquaculture is a growing industry, currently providing over half the consumed fish worldwide. Through genetic engineering it is possible to increase growth rates, reduce food intake, remove allergenic properties, increase cold tolerance and provide disease resistance. Fish can also be used to detect aquatic pollution or function as bioreactors.

Several groups have been developing zebrafish to detect pollution by attaching fluorescent proteins to genes activated by the presence of pollutants. The fish will then glow and can be used as environmental sensors. The GloFish is a brand of genetically modified fluorescent zebrafish with bright red, green, and orange fluorescent color. It was originally developed by one of the groups to detect pollution, but is now part of the ornamental fish trade, becoming the first genetically modified animal to become publicly available as a pet when in 2003 it was introduced for sale in the USA.

GM fish are widely used in basic research in genetics and development. Two species of fish, zebrafish and medaka, are most commonly modified because they have optically clear chorions (membranes in the egg), rapidly develop, and the one-cell embryo is easy to see and microinject with transgenic DNA. Zebrafish are model organisms for developmental processes, regeneration, genetics, behavior, disease mechanisms and toxicity testing. Their transparency allows researchers to observe developmental stages, intestinal functions and tumour growth. The generation of transgenic protocols (whole organism, cell or tissue specific, tagged with reporter genes) has increased the level of information gained by studying these fish.

GM fish have been developed with promoters driving an over-production of growth hormone for use in the aquaculture industry to increase the speed of development and potentially reduce fishing pressure on wild stocks. This has resulted in dramatic growth enhancement in several species, including salmon, trout and tilapia. AquaBounty Technologies, a biotechnology company, have produced a salmon (called AquAdvantage salmon) that can mature in half the time as wild salmon. It obtained regulatory approval in 2015, the first non-plant GMO food to be commercialized. As of August 2017, GMO salmon is being sold in Canada. Sales in the US started in May 2021.

=== Insects ===
In biological research, transgenic fruit flies (&quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;) are model organisms used to study the effects of genetic changes on development. Fruit flies are often preferred over other animals due to their short life cycle and low maintenance requirements. They also have a relatively simple genome compared to many vertebrates, with typically only one copy of each gene, making phenotypic analysis easy. &quot;Drosophila&quot; have been used to study genetics and inheritance, embryonic development, learning, behavior, and aging. The discovery of transposons, in particular the p-element, in &quot;Drosophila&quot; provided an early method to add transgenes to their genome, although this has been taken over by more modern gene-editing techniques.

Due to their significance to human health, scientists are looking at ways to control mosquitoes through genetic engineering. Malaria-resistant mosquitoes have been developed in the laboratory by inserting a gene that reduces the development of the malaria parasite and then use homing endonucleases to rapidly spread that gene throughout the male population (known as a gene drive). This approach has been taken further by using the gene drive to spread a lethal gene. In trials the populations of &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; mosquitoes, the single most important carrier of dengue fever and Zika virus, were reduced by between 80% and by 90%. Another approach is to use a sterile insect technique, whereby males genetically engineered to be sterile out compete viable males, to reduce population numbers.

Other insect pests that make attractive targets are moths. Diamondback moths cause US$4 to $5 billion of damage each year worldwide. The approach is similar to the sterile technique tested on mosquitoes, where males are transformed with a gene that prevents any females born from reaching maturity. They underwent field trials in 2017. Genetically modified moths have previously been released in field trials. In this case a strain of pink bollworm that were sterilized with radiation were genetically engineered to express a red fluorescent protein making it easier for researchers to monitor them.

Silkworm, the larvae stage of &quot;Bombyx mori&quot;, is an economically important insect in sericulture. Scientists are developing strategies to enhance silk quality and quantity. There is also potential to use the silk producing machinery to make other valuable proteins. Proteins currently developed to be expressed by silkworms include; human serum albumin, human collagen α-chain, mouse monoclonal antibody and N-glycanase. Silkworms have been created that produce spider silk, a stronger but extremely difficult to harvest silk, and even novel silks.

=== Other ===

Systems have been developed to create transgenic organisms in a wide variety of other animals. Chickens have been genetically modified for a variety of purposes. This includes studying embryo development, preventing the transmission of bird flu and providing evolutionary insights using reverse engineering to recreate dinosaur-like phenotypes. A GM chicken that produces the drug Kanuma, an enzyme that treats a rare condition, in its egg passed US regulatory approval in 2015. Genetically modified frogs, in particular &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; and &quot;Xenopus tropicalis&quot;, are used in developmental biology research. GM frogs can also be used as pollution sensors, especially for endocrine disrupting chemicals. There are proposals to use genetic engineering to control cane toads in Australia.

The nematode &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; is one of the major model organisms for researching molecular biology. RNA interference (RNAi) was discovered in &quot;C. elegans&quot; and could be induced by simply feeding them bacteria modified to express double stranded RNA. It is also relatively easy to produce stable transgenic nematodes and this along with RNAi are the major tools used in studying their genes. The most common use of transgenic nematodes has been studying gene expression and localization by attaching reporter genes. Transgenes can also be combined with RNAi techniques to rescue phenotypes, study gene function, image cell development in real time or control expression for different tissues or developmental stages. Transgenic nematodes have been used to study viruses, toxicology, diseases, and to detect environmental pollutants.

The gene responsible for albinism in sea cucumbers has been found and used to engineer white sea cucumbers, a rare delicacy. The technology also opens the way to investigate the genes responsible for some of the cucumbers more unusual traits, including hibernating in summer, eviscerating their intestines, and dissolving their bodies upon death. Flatworms have the ability to regenerate themselves from a single cell. Until 2017 there was no effective way to transform them, which hampered research. By using microinjection and radiation scientists have now created the first genetically modified flatworms. The bristle worm, a marine annelid, has been modified. It is of interest due to its reproductive cycle being synchronized with lunar phases, regeneration capacity and slow evolution rate. Cnidaria such as &quot;Hydra&quot; and the sea anemone &quot;Nematostella vectensis&quot; are attractive model organisms to study the evolution of immunity and certain developmental processes. Other animals that have been genetically modified include snails, geckos, turtles, crayfish, oysters, shrimp, clams, abalone and sponges.

== Regulation ==

Genetically modified organisms are regulated by government agencies. This applies to research as well as the release of genetically modified organisms, including crops and food. The development of a regulatory framework concerning genetic engineering began in 1975, at Asilomar, California. The Asilomar meeting recommended a set of guidelines regarding the cautious use of recombinant technology and any products resulting from that technology. The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety was adopted on 29 January 2000 and entered into force on 11 September 2003. It is an international treaty that governs the transfer, handling, and use of genetically modified organisms. One hundred and fifty-seven countries are members of the Protocol and many use it as a reference point for their own regulations.

Universities and research institutes generally have a special committee that is responsible for approving any experiments that involve genetic engineering. Many experiments also need permission from a national regulatory group or legislation. All staff must be trained in the use of GMOs and all laboratories must gain approval from their regulatory agency to work with GMOs. The legislation covering GMOs are often derived from regulations and guidelines in place for the non-GMO version of the organism, although they are more severe. There is a near-universal system for assessing the relative risks associated with GMOs and other agents to laboratory staff and the community. They are assigned to one of four risk categories based on their virulence, the severity of the disease, the mode of transmission, and the availability of preventive measures or treatments. There are four biosafety levels that a laboratory can fall into, ranging from level 1 (which is suitable for working with agents not associated with disease) to level 4 (working with life-threatening agents). Different countries use different nomenclature to describe the levels and can have different requirements for what can be done at each level.


There are differences in the regulation for the release of GMOs between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the US and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety. Some nations have banned the release of GMOs or restricted their use, and others permit them with widely differing degrees of regulation. In 2016, thirty eight countries officially ban or prohibit the cultivation of GMOs and nine (Algeria, Bhutan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Madagascar, Peru, Russia, Venezuela and Zimbabwe) ban their importation. Most countries that do not allow GMO cultivation do permit research using GMOs. Despite regulation, illegal releases have sometimes occurred, due to weakness of enforcement.

The European Union (EU) differentiates between approval for cultivation within the EU and approval for import and processing. While only a few GMOs have been approved for cultivation in the EU a number of GMOs have been approved for import and processing. The cultivation of GMOs has triggered a debate about the market for GMOs in Europe. Depending on the coexistence regulations, incentives for cultivation of GM crops differ. The US policy does not focus on the process as much as other countries, looks at verifiable scientific risks and uses the concept of substantial equivalence. Whether gene edited organisms should be regulated the same as genetically modified organism is debated. USA regulations sees them as separate and does not regulate them under the same conditions, while in Europe a GMO is any organism created using genetic engineering techniques.

One of the key issues concerning regulators is whether GM products should be labeled. The European Commission says that mandatory labeling and traceability are needed to allow for informed choice, avoid potential false advertising and facilitate the withdrawal of products if adverse effects on health or the environment are discovered. The American Medical Association and the American Association for the Advancement of Science say that absent scientific evidence of harm even voluntary labeling is misleading and will falsely alarm consumers. Labeling of GMO products in the marketplace is required in 64 countries. Labeling can be mandatory up to a threshold GM content level (which varies between countries) or voluntary. In the U.S., the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard (Mandatory Compliance Date: January 1, 2022) requires labeling GM foods. In Canada, labeling of GM food is voluntary, while in Europe all food (including processed food) or feed which contains greater than 0.9% of approved GMOs must be labeled. In 2014, sales of products that had been labeled as non-GMO grew 30 percent to $1.1 billion.

== Controversy ==
There is controversy over GMOs, especially with regard to their release outside laboratory environments. The dispute involves consumers, producers, biotechnology companies, governmental regulators, non-governmental organizations, and scientists. Many of these concerns involve GM crops and whether food produced from them is safe and what impact growing them will have on the environment. These controversies have led to litigation, international trade disputes, and protests, and to restrictive regulation of commercial products in some countries. Most concerns are around the health and environmental effects of GMOs. These include whether they may provoke an allergic reaction, whether the transgenes could transfer to human cells, and whether genes not approved for human consumption could outcross into the food supply.

There is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation.
As late as the 1990s gene flow into wild populations was thought to be unlikely and rare, and if it were to occur, easily eradicated. It was thought that this would add no additional environmental costs or risks – no effects were expected other than those already caused by pesticide applications. However, in the decades since, several such examples have been observed. Gene flow between GM crops and compatible plants, along with increased use of broad-spectrum herbicides, can increase the risk of herbicide resistant weed populations. Debate over the extent and consequences of gene flow intensified in 2001 when a paper was published showing transgenes had been found in landrace maize in Mexico, the crop&#x27;s center of diversity. Gene flow from GM crops to other organisms has been found to generally be lower than what would occur naturally. In order to address some of these concerns some GMOs have been developed with traits to help control their spread. To prevent the genetically modified salmon inadvertently breeding with wild salmon, all the fish raised for food are females, triploid, 99% are reproductively sterile, and raised in areas where escaped salmon could not survive. Bacteria have also been modified to depend on nutrients that cannot be found in nature, and genetic use restriction technology has been developed, though not yet marketed, that causes the second generation of GM plants to be sterile.

Other environmental and agronomic concerns include a decrease in biodiversity, an increase in secondary pests (non-targeted pests) and evolution of resistant insect pests. In the areas of China and the US with Bt crops the overall biodiversity of insects has increased and the impact of secondary pests has been minimal. Resistance was found to be slow to evolve when best practice strategies were followed. The impact of Bt crops on beneficial non-target organisms became a public issue after a 1999 paper suggested they could be toxic to monarch butterflies. Follow up studies have since shown that the toxicity levels encountered in the field were not high enough to harm the larvae.

Accusations that scientists are &quot;playing God&quot; and other religious issues have been ascribed to the technology from the beginning. With the ability to genetically engineer humans now possible there are ethical concerns over how far this technology should go, or if it should be used at all. Much debate revolves around where the line between treatment and enhancement is and whether the modifications should be inheritable. Other concerns include contamination of the non-genetically modified food supply, the rigor of the regulatory process, consolidation of control of the food supply in companies that make and sell GMOs, exaggeration of the benefits of genetic modification, or concerns over the use of herbicides with glyphosate. Other issues raised include the patenting of life and the use of intellectual property rights.

There are large differences in consumer acceptance of GMOs, with Europeans more likely to view GM food negatively than North Americans. GMOs arrived on the scene as the public confidence in food safety, attributed to recent food scares such as Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and other scandals involving government regulation of products in Europe, was low. This along with campaigns run by various non-governmental organizations (NGO) have been very successful in blocking or limiting the use of GM crops. NGOs like the Organic Consumers Association, the Union of Concerned Scientists, Greenpeace and other groups have said that risks have not been adequately identified and managed and that there are unanswered questions regarding the potential long-term impact on human health from food derived from GMOs. They propose mandatory labeling or a moratorium on such products.

<doc id="12341" wikidata="Q1296" url="?curid=12341" title="Ghent">
<text>Ghent ( ; ; historically known as &quot;Gaunt&quot; in English) is a city and a municipality in the Flemish Region of Belgium. It is the capital and largest city of the province of East Flanders, and the third largest in the country, after Brussels and Antwerp. It is a port and university city.
The city originally started as a settlement at the confluence of the Rivers Scheldt and Leie. In the Late Middle Ages Ghent became one of the largest and richest cities of northern Europe, with some 50,000 people in 1300. After the late 16th century Ghent became a less important city, resulting in an extremely well-preserved historic centre, that now makes Ghent an important destination of tourism.

The municipality comprises the city of Ghent proper and the surrounding suburbs of Afsnee, Desteldonk, Drongen, Gentbrugge, Ledeberg, Mariakerke, Mendonk, Oostakker, Sint-Amandsberg, Sint-Denijs-Westrem, Sint-Kruis-Winkel, Wondelgem and Zwijnaarde. With 270,473 inhabitants at the end of 2024, Ghent is Belgium&#x27;s second largest municipality by number of inhabitants. The metropolitan area, including the outer commuter zone, covers an area of and had a total population of 560,522 as of 1 January 2018, which ranks it as the fourth most populous in Belgium. The current mayor of Ghent is Mathias De Clercq (Open Vld).

The ten-day-long Ghent Festival (&quot;Gentse Feesten&quot;) is held every year and attended by about 1–1.5 million visitors.

==History==

Archaeological evidence shows human presence around the confluence of the Scheldt and the Leie going back as far as the Stone Age and the Iron Age.

Most historians believe that the older name for Ghent, &#x27;Ganda&#x27;, is derived from the Celtic word &quot;ganda&quot;, which means &#x27;confluence&#x27;, or &#x27;river mouth&#x27;, referring to the Leie river debouching into the Scheldt. Other sources connect its name with an obscure deity named Gontia.

There are no written records of the Roman period, but archaeological research confirms that the Ghent area continued to be inhabited.

When the Franks invaded the Roman territories from the end of the 4th century and well into the 5th century, they brought their language with them, and Celtic and Latin were replaced by Old Dutch.

===Middle Ages===
Around 650, Saint Amand founded two abbeys in Ghent: St. Peter&#x27;s (Blandinium) and St. Bavo&#x27;s Abbey. Around 800, Louis the Pious, son of Charlemagne, appointed Einhard, the biographer of Charlemagne, abbot of both abbeys. The city grew from several nuclei, the abbeys, and a commercial centre. However, in 851 and 879 the city was plundered by Vikings. 
Under the protection of the County of Flanders the city recovered and flourished from the 11th century, growing to become a small city-state. By the 13th century, Ghent was the biggest city in Europe north of the Alps after Paris; it was bigger than Cologne or Moscow. Up to 65,000 people lived within the city walls. The belfry and the towers of the St. Bavo&#x27;s Cathedral and St. Nicholas&#x27; Church are just a few examples of the skyline of the period.

The rivers flowed in an area where much land was periodically flooded. These rich grass &#x27;meersen&#x27; (&quot;water-meadows&quot;: a word related to the English &#x27;marsh&#x27;) were ideally suited for herding sheep, the wool of which was used to make cloth. Ghent was the leading city for cloth during the Middle Ages.

The wool industry, originally established at Bruges, created the first European industrialized zone in Ghent in the High Middle Ages. The mercantile zone was so highly developed that wool had to be imported from Scotland and England, which led to Flanders&#x27; good relationship with them. However, during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, trade with England suffered significantly. Ghent was the birthplace of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster.

===Early modern period===
The city recovered in the 15th century when Flanders was united with neighbouring provinces under the Dukes of Burgundy. High taxes led to a rebellion and eventually to the Battle of Gavere in 1453, in which Ghent suffered a terrible defeat at the hands of Philip the Good. Around this time the centre of political and social importance in the Low Countries started to shift from Flanders (Bruges–Ghent) to Brabant (Antwerp–Brussels), although Ghent continued to play an important role. With Bruges, the city led two revolts against Maximilian of Austria, the first monarch of the House of Habsburg to rule Flanders.
In 1500, Juana of Castile gave birth to Charles V, who became Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. Although native to Ghent, he punished the city after the 1539 Revolt of Ghent and obliged the city&#x27;s nobles to walk in front of the Emperor barefoot with a noose (Dutch: &quot;strop&quot;) around the neck; since this incident, the people of Ghent have been called &quot;Stroppendragers&quot; (noose bearers). St. Bavo&#x27;s Abbey (not to be confused with the nearby St. Bavo&#x27;s Cathedral) was abolished, torn down, and replaced with a fortress for Royal Spanish troops. Only a small portion of the abbey was spared demolition.


The late 16th and 17th centuries brought devastation because of the Eighty Years&#x27; War. The war ended the role of Ghent as a centre of international importance. In 1745, the city was captured by French forces during the War of the Austrian Succession before being returned to the Empire of Austria under the House of Habsburg following the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. This part of Flanders became known as the Austrian Netherlands until the exile of the French Emperor Napoleon I, the end of the French Revolutionary and later Napoleonic Wars, and the peace treaties arrived at by the Congress of Vienna in 1815.

===19th century===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, Ghent&#x27;s textile industry flourished again. Lieven Bauwens, having smuggled the industrial and factory machine plans out of England, introduced the first mechanical weaving machine on the European continent in 1800.

The Treaty of Ghent, negotiated here and adopted on Christmas Eve 1814, formally ended the War of 1812 between Great Britain and the United States (the North American phase of the Napoleonic Wars). After the Battle of Waterloo, Ghent and Flanders, previously ruled from the House of Habsburg in Vienna as the Austrian Netherlands, became a part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands with the northern Dutch for 15 years. In this period, Ghent established its own university (1816) and a new connection to the sea (1824–27).

After the Belgian Revolution, with the loss of port access to the sea for more than a decade, the local economy collapsed, and the first Belgian trade union originated in Ghent. In 1913 there was a world exhibition in Ghent. As a preparation for these festivities, the Sint-Pieters railway station was completed in 1912.

===20th century===
Ghent was occupied by the Germans in both world wars but escaped severe destruction. The life of the people and the German invaders in Ghent during World War I is described by H. Wandt in &quot;etappenleven te Gent&quot;. In World War II the city was liberated by the British 7th &quot;Desert Rats&quot; Armoured Division and local Belgian fighters on 6 September 1944, with the northern suburbs and the industrial area cleared over the following days by the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division.

==Demographics==
===Nationalities===

Ghent is home to many people of foreign origin and immigrants. The 2020 census revealed that 35.5% of the inhabitants had roots outside of Belgium and 15.3% had a non-Belgian nationality. Many neighbourhoods already have a minority-majority population, primarily in the north, east, and west of the city and some pockets in the south. Some examples are Brugse Poort, Dampoort, Rabot, Ledeberg, Nieuw Gent/UZ and the area around Sleepstraat (known for its many Turkish restaurants).

===Architecture===

 
Much of the city&#x27;s medieval architecture remains intact and is remarkably well preserved and restored. Its centre is a carfree area. Highlights are St. Bavo&#x27;s Cathedral with the &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot;, the belfry, the Gravensteen castle, and the splendid architecture along the old Graslei harbour. Ghent has established a blend between comfort of living and history; it is not a city-museum. The city of Ghent also houses three béguinages and numerous churches including St. Jacob&#x27;s Church, St. Nicholas&#x27; Church, St. Michael&#x27;s Church and St. Stefanus&#x27; Church.
In the 19th century Ghent&#x27;s most famous architect, Louis Roelandt, built the university hall Aula, the opera house, and the main courthouse. Highlights of modern architecture are the university buildings (the &quot;Boekentoren&quot; or Book Tower) by Henry Van de Velde. There are also a few theatres from diverse periods.

The beguinages, as well as the belfry and adjacent cloth hall, were recognized by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites in 1998 and 1999.

The Zebrastraat, a social experiment in which an entirely renovated site unites living, economy, and culture, can also be found in Ghent.

Campo Santo is a famous Catholic burial site of the nobility and artists.

One of the more notable pieces of contemporary architecture in Ghent is De Krook, the new central library and media center, a collaboration between local firm Coussée and Goris and Catalan firm RCR Arquitectos.

===Museums===
Important museums in Ghent are the Museum voor Schone Kunsten (Museum of Fine Arts), with paintings by Hieronymus Bosch, Peter Paul Rubens, and many Flemish masters; the SMAK or Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst (City Museum for Contemporary Art), with works of the 20th century, including Joseph Beuys and Andy Warhol; and the Design Museum Gent with masterpieces of Victor Horta and Le Corbusier. The Huis van Alijn (House of the Alijn family) was originally a beguinage and is now a museum for folk art where theatre and puppet shows for children are presented. The &quot;Museum voor Industriële Archeologie en Textiel&quot; or MIAT displays the industrial strength of Ghent with recreations of workshops and stores from the 1800s and original spinning and weaving machines that remain from the time when the building was a weaving mill. The Ghent City Museum (Stadsmuseum, abbreviated STAM), is committed to recording and explaining the city&#x27;s past and its inhabitants, and to preserving the present for future generations.

===Theatre===
NTGent is the city theatre of Ghent, a public institution known for its radical productions. The theatre company&#x27;s home base is in the (Koninklijke Nederlandse Schouwburg, or KNS), with a secondary location in the city at Minnemeers. The company also tours extensively.

===Restaurants and culinary traditions===
In Ghent and other regions of East Flanders, bakeries sell a donut-shaped bun called a &quot;mastel&quot; (plural &quot;mastellen&quot;), which is basically a bagel. &quot;Mastellen&quot; are also called &quot;Saint Hubert bread&quot;, because, on the Saint&#x27;s feast day, which is 3 November, the bakers bring their batches to the early Mass to be blessed. Traditionally, it was thought that blessed mastellen immunized against rabies.

Other local delicacies are the praline chocolates from local producers such as Leonidas, the cuberdons or &#x27;neuzekes&#x27; (&#x27;noses&#x27;), cone-shaped purple jelly-filled candies (a four-year feud between two local vendors made international news), &#x27;babelutten&#x27; (&#x27;babblers&#x27;), hard butterscotch-like candy, and of course, on the more fiery side, the famous &#x27;Tierenteyn&#x27;, a hot but refined mustard that has some affinity to French &#x27;Dijon&#x27; mustard.

Stoverij is a classic Flemish meat stew, preferably made with a generous addition of brown &#x27;Trappist&#x27; (strong abbey beer) and served with French fries. &#x27;Waterzooi&#x27; is a local stew originally made from freshwater fish caught in the rivers and creeks of Ghent, but nowadays often made with chicken instead of fish. It is usually served nouvelle-cuisine-style and supplemented by a large pot on the side.

The city promotes a meat-free day on Thursdays called &quot;Donderdag Veggiedag&quot; with vegetarian food being promoted in public canteens for civil servants and elected councillors, in all city-funded schools, and promotion of vegetarian eating options in town (through the distribution of &quot;veggie street maps&quot;). This campaign is linked to the recognition of the detrimental environmental effects of meat production, which the United Nations&#x27; Food and Agriculture Organization has established to represent nearly one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions.

===Festivals and other events===
The city is host to some big cultural events such as the Ghent Festival, the International Film Festival of Ghent (with the World Soundtrack Awards) and the . Also, every five years, an extensive botanical exhibition (&quot;Gentse Floraliën&quot;) takes place in Flanders Expo in Ghent, attracting numerous visitors to the city.

The Ghent Festival (&quot;Gentse Feesten&quot; in Dutch) is an annual festival that lasts for ten days. It has been held for more than 50 years (since 1969) and is attended by about 1–1.5 million visitors. It did not take place in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium, being held again in the summer of 2022, after a two-year break.

The Festival of Flanders had its 50th celebration in 2008. In Ghent, it opens with the OdeGand City festivities that take place on the second Saturday of September. Some 50 concerts take place in diverse locations throughout the medieval inner city and some 250 international artists perform.

Ghent co-hosted the 2021 World Choir Games together with Antwerp. Organised by the Interkultur Foundation, the World Choir Games is the biggest choral competition and festival in the world.

Ghent has been chosen as the 2024 European Youth Capital by the European Youth Forum.

===Parks===
The numerous parks in the city can also be considered tourist attractions. Most notably, Ghent boasts a nature reserve (Bourgoyen-Ossemeersen, ) and a recreation park (Blaarmeersen, 87 hectares; 215 acres).

==Economy==
The port of Ghent, in the north of the city, is the third-largest port of Belgium. It is accessed by the Ghent–Terneuzen Canal, which ends near the Dutch port of Terneuzen on the Western Scheldt. The port houses, among others, large companies like ArcelorMittal, Volvo Cars, Volvo Trucks, Volvo Parts, Honda, Yamaha Motor and Stora Enso.

The Ghent University and several research-oriented companies, such as Ablynx, Innogenetics, Cropdesign, and Bayer Cropscience, are situated in the central and southern part of the city.

As the largest city in East Flanders, Ghent has four large hospitals, numerous schools, and shopping streets. Flanders Expo, the biggest event hall in Flanders and the second biggest in Belgium, is also located in Ghent. Tourism is becoming a major employer in the local area.

Apart from the city buses mentioned above, Ghent also has numerous regional bus lines connecting it to towns and villages across the province of East Flanders. All of these buses stop in at least one of the city&#x27;s regional bus hubs at either Sint-Pieters Station, Dampoort Station, Zuid or Rabot.

International buses connecting Ghent to other European destinations are usually found at the Dampoort Station. A couple of private bus companies such as Eurolines, Megabus and Flixbus operate from the Dampoort bus hub.

Buses to and from Belgium&#x27;s first (Brussels Airport) and second airport (Brussels South Charleroi Airport) are operated by Flibco, and can be found at the rear exit of the Sint-Pieters Station.

===Cycling===
Ghent has the largest designated cyclist area in Europe, with nearly of cycle paths and more than 700 one-way streets, where bikes are allowed to go against the traffic. It also boasts Belgium&#x27;s first bicycle boulevard, where cars are considered &#x27;guests&#x27; and must stay behind cyclists. In 2013, it began doing on-street surveys of bicycles, adding bicycle parking racks in neighbourhoods where they were needed. In 2017, the city changed traffic circulation patterns to favour cycling. The switch was done over the course of a single weekend, changing traffic circulation on over 80 streets and 2500 road signs. It expanded the car-free zone in the historic city center more than twofold. It also put in radial barriers to car traffic, thus shifting it onto the inner ring road.

More cyclists means a higher demand for bicycle parking stations. In 2010, the plans to renovate Gent-Sint-Pieters railway station included 10,000 bicycle parking spots. In 2020, several sections of the underground parking facilities have been built, and the targets have been adjusted to a total of 17,000 parking spots.

==Sports==

In the Belgian first football division Ghent is represented by K.A.A. Gent, who became Belgian football champions for the first time in its history in 2015. Another Ghent football club is KRC Gent-Zeehaven, playing in the Belgian fourth division. A football match at the 1920 Summer Olympics was held in Ghent.

The Six Days of Ghent, a six-day track cycling race, is held annually, taking place in the Kuipke velodrome in Ghent. In road cycling, the city hosts the start and finish of the , the traditional opening race of the cobbled classics season. It also lends its name to another cobbled classic, Gent–Wevelgem, although the race now starts in the nearby city of Deinze.

The city hosts an annual athletics IAAF event in the Flanders Sports Arena: the Indoor Flanders meeting where two-time Olympic champion Hicham El Guerrouj set an indoor world record of 3:48.45 in the mile run in 1997.

The Flanders Sports Arena was host to the 2015 Davis Cup Final between Belgium and Great Britain.

<text>Guadeloupe (; ; , ) is an overseas department and region of France in the Caribbean. It consists of six inhabited islands—Basse-Terre, Grande-Terre, Marie-Galante, La Désirade, and two Îles des Saintes—as well as many uninhabited islands and outcroppings. It is south of Antigua and Barbuda and Montserrat and north of Dominica. The capital city is Basse-Terre, on the southern west coast of Basse-Terre Island; the most populous city is Les Abymes and the main centre of business is neighbouring Pointe-à-Pitre, both on Grande-Terre Island. It had a population of 395,726 in 2024.

Like the other overseas departments, it is an integral part of France. As a constituent territory of the European Union and the eurozone, the euro is its official currency and any European Union citizen is free to settle and work there indefinitely, but is not part of the Schengen Area. It included Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin until 2007, when they were detached from Guadeloupe following a 2003 referendum.

Christopher Columbus visited Guadeloupe in 1493 and gave the island its name. The official language is French; Antillean Creole is also spoken.

== Etymology ==

The archipelago was called (or &quot;The Island of Beautiful Waters&quot;) by the native Arawak people.

Christopher Columbus named the island in 1493 after Our Lady of Guadalupe, a shrine to the Virgin Mary venerated in the Spanish town of Guadalupe, Extremadura. When the area became a French colony, the Spanish name was retained – though altered to French orthography and phonology. The islands are locally known as .

== History ==

=== Pre-colonial era ===

The islands were first populated by Indigenous peoples of the Americas, possibly as far back as 3000 BC. The Arawak people are the first identifiable group, but they were later displaced by Kalina-Carib peoples.

=== 15th–17th centuries ===
Christopher Columbus was the first European to see Guadeloupe, landing in November 1493 and giving it its current name. Several attempts at colonisation by the Spanish in the 16th century failed due to attacks from the Native peoples. In 1626, the French, under the trader and adventurer Pierre Belain d&#x27;Esnambuc, began to take an interest in Guadeloupe, expelling Spanish settlers. The Compagnie des Îles de l&#x27;Amérique settled in Guadeloupe in 1635, under the direction of the French colonial leaders Charles Liénard de L&#x27;Olive and Jean du Plessis d&#x27;Ossonville; they formally took possession of the island for France and brought in French farmers to colonise the land. This led to the death of many Indigenous people by disease and violence. By 1640, however, the Compagnie des Îles de l&#x27;Amérique had gone bankrupt, and they thus sold Guadeloupe to Charles Houël du Petit Pré who began plantation agriculture, with the first African slaves arriving in 1650. Slave resistance was immediately widespread, with an open uprising in 1656 lasting several weeks and a simultaneous spate of mass desertions that lasted at least two years until the French compelled indigenous peoples to stop assisting them. Ownership of the island passed to the French West India Company before it was annexed to France in 1674 under the tutelage of their Martinique colony. Institutionalised slavery, enforced by the Code Noir from 1685, led to a booming sugar plantation economy.

=== 18th–19th centuries ===

During the Seven Years&#x27; War, British forces captured and occupied the islands until the 1763 Treaty of Paris. During that time, Pointe-à-Pitre became a major harbour, and markets in British America were opened to Guadeloupean sugar, which was traded for foodstuffs and timber. The economy expanded quickly, creating vast wealth for the French colonists. So prosperous was Guadeloupe at the time that, under the 1763 Treaty of Paris, France forfeited its Canadian colonies in exchange for the return of Guadeloupe. Coffee planting began in the late 1720s, also worked by slaves and, by 1775, cocoa had become a major export product as well.

The French Revolution brought chaos to Guadeloupe. Under new revolutionary law, freedmen were entitled to equal rights. Taking advantage of the chaotic political situation, Britain captured Guadeloupe in 1794. The French responded by sending an expeditionary force under Victor Hugues, which retook the colony by December and abolished slavery. More than 1,000 French colonists were killed in the aftermath.

In 1802, a French expeditionary force under Antoine Richepanse arrived in Guadeloupe, prompting a rebellion led by Black officers who had until then been the &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of the colony. Richepanse and his troops acted quickly against the rebels, culminating in the Battle of Matouba on 28 May 1802. Realising they had no chance of success, Louis Delgrès and his followers committed mass suicide by deliberately exploding their gunpowder stores. A consular decree published on 6 July 1802 discreetly ordered the reestablishment of slavery in Guadeloupe. An insurgency against the French, who officially reestablished slavery in Guadeloupe on 14 May 1803, continued until 1804. In 1810, the British captured the island again, handing it over to Sweden under the 1813 Treaty of Stockholm.

In the 1814 Treaty of Paris, Sweden ceded Guadeloupe to France, giving rise to the Guadeloupe Fund. In 1815, the Treaty of Vienna acknowledged French control of Guadeloupe.

Slavery was abolished in the French Empire in 1848. After 1854, indentured labourers from the French colony of Pondicherry in India were brought in. Emancipated slaves had the vote from 1849, but French nationality and the vote were not granted to Indian citizens until 1923, when a long campaign, led by Henry Sidambarom, finally achieved success.

=== 20th–21st centuries ===
In 1936, Félix Éboué became the first black governor of Guadeloupe. During World War II, Guadeloupe initially came under the control of the Vichy government, later joining Free France in 1943. In 1946, the colony of Guadeloupe became an overseas department of France.

Tensions arose in the post-war era over the social structure of Guadeloupe and its relationship with mainland France. The &#x27;Massacre of St Valentine&#x27; occurred in 1952, when striking factory workers in Le Moule were shot at by the Compagnies républicaines de sécurité, resulting in four deaths. In May 1967 racial tensions exploded into rioting following a racist attack on a black Guadeloupean, Raphael Balzinc, resulting in eight deaths.

An independence movement grew in the 1970s, prompting France to declare Guadeloupe a French region in 1974. The Union populaire pour la libération de la Guadeloupe (UPLG) campaigned for complete independence, and by the 1980s the situation had turned violent with the actions of groups such as (GLA) and Alliance révolutionnaire caraïbe (ARC).

Greater autonomy was granted to Guadeloupe in 2000. Through a referendum in 2003, Saint-Martin and Saint Barthélemy voted to separate from the administrative jurisdiction of Guadeloupe, this being fully enacted by 2007.

In January 2009, labour unions and others known as the Liyannaj Kont Pwofitasyon went on strike for more pay. Strikers were angry with low wages, the high cost of living, high levels of poverty relative to mainland France and levels of unemployment that are amongst the worst in the European Union. The situation quickly escalated, exacerbated by what was seen as an ineffectual response by the French government, turning violent and prompting the deployment of extra police after a union leader (Jacques Bino) was shot and killed. The strike lasted 44 days and had also inspired similar actions on nearby Martinique. President Nicolas Sarkozy later visited the island, promising reform. Tourism suffered greatly during this time and affected the 2010 tourist season as well.

== Geography ==


Guadeloupe is an archipelago of more than 12 islands, as well as islets and rocks situated where the northeastern Caribbean Sea meets the western Atlantic Ocean. It is located in the Leeward Islands in the northern part of the Lesser Antilles, a partly volcanic island arc. To the north lie Antigua and Barbuda and the British Overseas Territory of Montserrat, with Dominica lying to the south.

The two main islands are Basse-Terre (west) and Grande-Terre (east), which form a butterfly shape as viewed from above, the two &#x27;wings&#x27; of which are separated by the , and . More than half of Guadeloupe&#x27;s land surface consists of the 847.8 km2 Basse-Terre. The island is mountainous, containing such peaks as Mount Sans Toucher () and Grande Découverte (), culminating in the active volcano La Grande Soufrière, the highest mountain peak in the Lesser Antilles with an elevation of . In contrast Grande-Terre is mostly flat, with rocky coasts to the north, irregular hills at the centre, mangrove at the southwest, and white sand beaches sheltered by coral reefs along the southern shore. This is where the main tourist resorts are found.

Marie-Galante is the third-largest island, followed by La Désirade, a north-east slanted limestone plateau, the highest point of which is . To the south lie the Îles de Petite-Terre, which are two islands (Terre de Haut and Terre de Bas) totalling 2 km2.

Les Saintes is an archipelago of eight islands of which two, Terre-de-Bas and Terre-de-Haut are inhabited. The landscape is similar to that of Basse-Terre, with volcanic hills and irregular shoreline with deep bays.

There are numerous other smaller islands.

=== Geology ===
Basse-Terre is a volcanic island. The Lesser Antilles are at the outer edge of the Caribbean Plate, and Guadeloupe is part of the outer arc of the Lesser Antilles Volcanic Arc. Many of the islands were formed as a result of the subduction of oceanic crust of the Atlantic Plate under the Caribbean Plate in the Lesser Antilles subduction zone. This process is ongoing and is responsible for volcanic and earthquake activity in the region. Guadeloupe was formed from multiple volcanoes, of which only La Grande Soufrière is not extinct. Its last eruption was in 1976, and led to the evacuation of the southern part of Basse-Terre. 73,600 people were displaced throughout three and a half months following the eruption.

K–Ar dating indicates that the three northern massifs on Basse-Terre Island are 2.79 million years old. Sections of volcanoes collapsed and eroded within the last 650,000 years, after which the Sans Toucher volcano grew in the collapsed area. Volcanoes in the north of Basse-Terre Island mainly produced andesite and basaltic andesite. There are several beaches of dark or &quot;black&quot; sand.

La Désirade, east of the main islands, has a basement from the Mesozoic, overlaid with thick limestones from the Pliocene to Quaternary periods.

Grande-Terre and Marie-Galante have basements probably composed of volcanic units of Eocene to Oligocene, but there are no visible outcrops. On Grande-Terre, the overlying carbonate platform is 120 metres thick.

=== Climate ===
The islands are part of the Leeward Islands, so called because they are downwind of the prevailing trade winds, which blow out of the northeast. This was significant in the days of sailing ships. Grande-Terre is so named because it is on the eastern, or windward side, exposed to the Atlantic winds. Basse-Terre is so named because it is on the leeward south-west side and sheltered from the winds. Guadeloupe has a tropical climate tempered by maritime influences and the Trade Winds. There are two seasons, the dry season called &quot;Lent&quot; from January to June, and the wet season called &quot;winter&quot;, from July to December.


=== Tropical cyclones and storm surges ===
Located in a very exposed region, Guadeloupe and its dependencies have to face many cyclones. The deadliest hurricane to hit Guadeloupe was the Pointe-à-Pitre hurricane of 1776, which killed at least 6,000 people.

In 1989, Hurricane Hugo caused severe damage to the islands of the archipelago and left a deep mark on the memory of the local inhabitants. In 1995, three hurricanes (Iris, Luis and Marilyn) hit the archipelago in less than three weeks. Other notable hurricanes include Okeechobee in 1928, Betsy in 1965, Cleo in 1964, Inez in 1966, and Irma and Maria in 2017.

=== Flora ===

With fertile volcanic soils, heavy rainfall and a warm climate, vegetation on Basse-Terre is lush. Most of the island&#x27;s forests are on Basse-Terre, containing such species as mahogany, ironwood and chestnut trees. Mangrove swamps line the Salée River. Much of the forest on Grande-Terre has been cleared, with only a few small patches remaining.

Between of altitude, the rainforest that covers a large part of the island of Basse-Terre develops. Vegetation there includes the white gum tree, the acomat-boucan or chestnut tree, the marbri or bois-bandé or the oleander; shrubs and herbaceous plants such as the mountain palm, the balisier or ferns; many epiphytes: bromeliads, philodendrons, orchids and lianas. Above , the humid savannah develops, composed of mosses, lichens, sphagnum or more vigorous plants such as mountain mangrove, high altitude violet or mountain thyme.

The dry forest occupies a large part of the islands of Grande-Terre, Marie-Galante, Les Saintes, La Désirade and also develops on the leeward coast of Basse-Terre. The coastal forest is more difficult to develop because of the nature of the soil (sandy, rocky), salinity, sunshine and wind and is the environment where the sea grape, the mancenilla (a very toxic tree whose trunk is marked with a red line), the icaquier or the Coconut tree grow. On the cliffs and in the Arid zones are found cacti such as the cactus-cigar (Cereus), the prickly pear, the chestnut cactus, the &quot;Tête à l&#x27;anglais&quot; cactus and the aloes.

The Mangrove forest that borders some of Guadalupe&#x27;s coasts is structured in three levels, from the closest to the sea to the farthest. On the first level are the red mangroves; on the second, about from the sea, the black mangroves form the shrubby mangrove; on the third level the white mangroves form the tall mangrove. Behind the mangrove, where the tide and salt do not penetrate, a swamp forest sometimes develops, unique in Guadeloupe. The representative species of this environment is the Mangrove-medaille.

=== Fauna ===
Few terrestrial mammals, aside from bats and raccoons, are native to the islands. The introduced Javan mongoose is also present on Guadeloupe. Bird species include the endemic purple-throated carib and the Guadeloupe woodpecker. The waters of the islands support a rich variety of marine life.

However, by studying 43,000 bone remains from six islands in the archipelago, it was found that 50 to 70% of snakes and lizards on the Guadeloupe Islands became extinct after European colonists arrived; they had brought with them mammals such as cats, mongooses, rats, and raccoons, which might have preyed upon the native reptiles.

=== Environmental preservation ===
In recent decades, Guadeloupe&#x27;s natural environments have been affected by hunting and fishing, forest retreat, urbanization and suburbanization. They also suffer from the development of intensive crops (banana and sugar cane, in particular), which reached their peak in the years 1955–75. This has led to the following situation: seagrass beds and reefs have degraded by up to 50% around the large islands; mangroves and mantids have almost disappeared in Marie-Galante, Les Saintes and La Désirade; the salinity of the fresh water table has increased due to &quot;the intensity of use of the layer&quot;; and pollution of agricultural origin (pesticides and nitrogenous compounds).

In addition, the ChlEauTerre study, unveiled in March 2018, concludes that 37 different anthropogenic molecules (more than half of which come from residues of now-banned pesticides, such as chlordecone) were found in &quot;79% of the watersheds analyzed in Grande-Terre and 84% in Basse-Terre.&quot; A report by the Guadeloupe Water Office notes that in 2019 there is a &quot;generalized degradation of water bodies.&quot;

Despite everything, there is a will to preserve these environments whose vegetation and landscape are preserved in some parts of the islands and constitute a sensitive asset for tourism. These areas are partially protected and classified as ZNIEFF, sometimes with nature reserve status, and several caves are home to protected chiropterans.

The Guadalupe National Park was created on 20 February 1989. In 1992, under the auspices of UNESCO, the Biosphere Reserve of the Guadeloupe Archipelago (&quot;Réserve de biosphère de l&#x27;archipel de la Guadeloupe&quot;) was created. As a result, on 8 December 1993, the marine site of Grand Cul-de-sac was listed as a wetland of international importance. The island thus became the overseas department with the most protected areas.

=== Earthquakes and tsunamis ===
The archipelago is crossed by numerous geological faults such as those of la Barre or la Cadoue, while in depth, in front of Moule and La Désirade begins the Désirade Fault, and between the north of Maria-Galante and the south of Grande-Terre begins the Maria Galante Fault. And it is because of these geological characteristics, the islands of the department of Guadeloupe are classified in zone III according to the seismic zoning of France and are subject to a specific risk prevention plan.

The 1843 earthquake in the Lesser Antilles is, to this day, the most violent earthquake known. It caused the death of more than a thousand people, as well as major damage in Pointe-à-Pitre.

On 21 November 2004, the islands of the department, in particular Les Saintes archipelago, were shaken by a violent earthquake that reached a magnitude of 6.3 on the Richter scale and caused the death of one person, as well as extensive material damage.

=== Waterfalls ===
Guadeloupe is home to 100 waterfalls and cascades. Some of the most well-known or visited include Acomat Falls (&quot;Saut de l&#x27;Acomat&quot;), Carbet Falls (&quot;Chutes du Carbet&quot;), Crayfish Waterfall (&quot;Cascade aux Ecrevisses&quot;), and Lézarde Falls (&quot;Saut de la Lézarde&quot;). All of the waterfalls are located on the island of Basse-Terre.

== Demographics ==


The population of Guadeloupe was estimated to be 378,561 on 1 January 2024. The population is mainly Afro-Caribbean. European, Indian (Tamil, Telugu, and other South Indians), Lebanese, Syrians, and Chinese are all minorities. There is also a substantial population of Haitians in Guadeloupe who work mainly in construction and as street vendors. Basse-Terre is the political capital; however, the largest city and economic hub is Pointe-à-Pitre.

The population of Guadeloupe has been decreasing by 0.8% per year since 2013. In 2017 the average population density in Guadeloupe was , which is very high in comparison to metropolitan France&#x27;s average of . One third of the land is devoted to agriculture and all mountains are uninhabitable; this lack of space and shelter makes the population density even higher.

=== Major urban areas ===
The most populous urban unit (agglomeration) is Pointe-à-Pitre-Les Abymes, which covers 11 communes and 65% of the population of the department. The three largest urban units are:

=== Health ===
In 2011, life expectancy at birth was recorded at 77.0 years for males and 83.5 for females.

Medical centres in Guadeloupe include: University Hospital Centre (CHU) in Pointe-à-Pitre, Regional Hospital Centre (CHR) in Basse-Terre, and four hospitals located in Capesterre-Belle-Eau, Pointe-Noire, Bouillante and Saint-Claude.

The &quot;Institut Pasteur de la Guadeloupe&quot;, is located in Pointe-à-Pitre and is responsible for researching environmental hygiene, vaccinations, and the spread of tuberculosis and other mycobacteria.

=== Immigration ===
The relative wealth of Guadeloupe contrasts with the extreme poverty of several islands in the Caribbean region, which makes the community an attractive place for the populations of some of these territories. In addition, other factors, such as political instability and natural disasters, explain this immigration. As early as the 1970s, the first illegal immigrants of Haitian origin arrived in Guadeloupe to meet a need for labour in the agricultural sector; alongside this Haitian immigration, which is more visible because it is more numerous, Guadeloupe has also seen the arrival and settlement of populations from the island of Dominica and the Dominican Republic. In 2005, the prefecture, which represents the State in Guadeloupe, reported figures of between 50,000 and 60,000 foreigners in the department.
=== Migration ===
Created in 1963 by Michel Debré, Bumidom&#x27;s objective was to &quot;[...] contribute to the solution of demographic problems in the overseas departments&quot;. To this end, its missions were multiple: information for future emigrants, vocational training, family reunification and management of reception centres. At the time, this project was also seen as a means to diminish the influence of the West Indian independence movements, which were gaining strength in the 1960s.

Between 1963 and 1981, an estimated 16,562 Guadeloupeans emigrated to metropolitan France through Bumidom. And the miniseries Le Rêve français (The French Dream) sets out to recount some of the consequences of the emigration of West Indians and Reunionese to France.

An estimated 50,000 Guadeloupeans and Martinicans participated in the construction of the Panama Canal between 1904 and 1914. In 2014, it was estimated that there were between 60,000 and 70,000 descendants of these West Indians living in Panama. Other waves of migration to North America, especially to Canada, occurred at the beginning of the 20th century.

== Governance ==
Together with Martinique, La Réunion, Mayotte and French Guiana, Guadeloupe is one of the overseas departments, being both a region and a department. It is also an outermost region of the European Union. The inhabitants of Guadeloupe are French citizens with full political and legal rights.

Legislative powers are centred on the separate departmental and regional councils. The elected president of the Departmental Council of Guadeloupe is currently Guy Losbar (1 July 2021); its main areas of responsibility include the management of a number of social and welfare allowances, of junior high school (collège) buildings and technical staff, and local roads and school and rural buses. The Regional Council of Guadeloupe is a body, elected every six years, consisting of a president (currently Ary Chalus) and eight vice-presidents. The regional council oversees secondary education, regional transportation, economic development, the environment, and some infrastructure, among other things.

Guadeloupe elects one deputy from one of each of the first, second, third, and fourth constituencies to the National Assembly of France. Three senators are chosen for the Senate of France by indirect election. For electoral purposes, Guadeloupe is divided into two arrondissements (Basse-Terre and Pointe-à-Pitre), and 21 cantons.

Most of the French political parties are active in Guadeloupe. In addition there are also regional parties such as the Guadeloupe Communist Party, the Progressive Democratic Party of Guadeloupe, the Guadeloupean Objective, the Pluralist Left, and United Guadeloupe, Solidary and Responsible.

The prefecture (regional capital) of Guadeloupe is Basse-Terre. Local services of the state administration are traditionally organised at departmental level, where the prefect represents the government.

=== Administrative divisions ===

For the purposes of local government, Guadeloupe is divided into 32 communes. Each commune has a municipal council and a mayor. Revenues for the communes come from transfers from the French government, and local taxes. Administrative responsibilities at this level include water management, civil register, and municipal police.
=== Geopolitics ===
From a geostrategic point of view, Guadeloupe is located in a central part of the Caribbean archipelago between the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. This location in the region allows France to reach a large part of the eastern coast of the American continent. The exclusive economic zone formed by Guadeloupe and Martinique covers just over 126,146 square kilometres. In 1980 France established its maritime boundaries in the area by signing a Treaty with Venezuela. This offers France important fishing resources and independence to develop a sovereign policy of underwater research and protection (protection of humpback whales, Cousteau reserve, protection of coral reefs). Because of its geographical position, Guadeloupe allows France to participate in political and diplomatic dialogues at both the regional (Lesser and Greater Antilles) and continental (Latin and North America) levels.

The signing of the Regional Convention for the Internationalisation of Enterprise (CRIE), membership of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and membership of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS) are milestones that have enabled Guadeloupe to develop its bilateral or multilateral relations within the framework of international agreements or institutions.11 The development of bilateral and multilateral economic partnerships with other Caribbean and American states is based on the modernisation of the autonomous port of Guadeloupe and the importance of the Guadeloupe-Polo Caribe international airport.

=== Symbols and flags ===
As a part of France, Guadeloupe uses the French tricolour as its flag and as its anthem. However, a variety of other flags are also used in unofficial or informal contexts as the flag of Guadeloupe, most notably the sun-based flag. Independentists also have their own flag suggested by the People&#x27;s Union for the Liberation of Guadeloupe.

== Economy ==
The economy of Guadeloupe depends on tourism, agriculture, light industry and services. It is reliant upon mainland France for large subsidies and imports and public administration is the largest single employer on the islands. Unemployment is especially high among the youth population.

In 2017, the Gross domestic product (GDP) of Guadeloupe was €9.079 billion, and showed 3.4% growth. The GDP per capita of Guadeloupe was €23,152. Imports amounted to €3.019 billion, and exports to €1.157 billion. The main export products are bananas, sugar and rum. Banana exports suffered in 2017 from damages due to Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria.

=== Tourism ===
Tourism is one of the most prominent sources of income, with most visitors coming from France and North America. An increasingly large number of cruise ships visit Guadeloupe, the cruise terminal of which is in Pointe-à-Pitre.

=== Agriculture ===
The traditional sugar cane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50% of export earnings), eggplant, guinnep, noni, sapotilla, giraumon squash, yam, gourd, plantain, christophene, cocoa, jackfruit, pomegranate, and many varieties of flowers. Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is dependent upon imported food, mainly from the rest of France.

=== Light industry ===
Of the various light industries, sugar and rum production, solar energy, cement, furniture and clothing are the most prominent. Most manufactured goods and fuel are imported.

== Culture ==

=== Language ===
Guadeloupe&#x27;s official language is French, which is spoken by nearly all of the population. Most residents also speak Guadeloupean Creole, a French-based creole language.

Guadeloupean Creole emerged as a result of the need for all ethnic groups (French, African and Amerindian) to be able to understand each other. This language is therefore the result of a mixture created in the 17th century in response to a communicative emergency. At the time of the colony&#x27;s foundation, a majority of the French population did not speak the standard French language but local dialects and languages, such as Breton and Norman, while the Africans came from a variety of West and Central African ethnic groups and lacked a common language themselves. The Creole language emerged as a lingua franca and ultimately became the native language of much of the population.

Moreover, Terre-de-Haut and Terre-de-Bas, in the Saintes archipelago, due to their settlement history (Breton, Norman and Poitevin settlers), have their own Creoles which differ from Guadeloupean Creole by their French pronunciations, their particular expressions, their syntax and their sonorities. Although it is not transcribed, these islanders call their Creole &quot;patois&quot; or &quot;language of St. Martin&quot; and actively ensure its transmission and perpetuation by their descendants in vernacular form.

A Guadeloupean béké first wrote Creole at the end of the 17th century, transcribing it using French orthography.

As Guadeloupe is a French department, French is the official language. However, Guadeloupean French (in contact with Creole) has certain linguistic characteristics that differ from those of standard metropolitan French. Recently, a very detailed study of the phonetic aspect of Guadeloupean French has been undertaken (this would be the first study to deal with both the acoustic and the phonological and perceptual aspects of Guadeloupean French in particular and West Indian French in general). It is also concerned with the reading varieties of Guadeloupean French (acrolect, mesolect and basilect).

In recent decades there has been a revival of Creole, which has stimulated the appearance of books of short stories and poetry published in Creole and French over the last ten years. In this context, Hector Poullet is a pioneer of Creole-mediated dictation. Creole is also a very colourful language and very philosophical in its expressions and phrases, which, translated literally into French, can be confusing. The representatives of the older generations are not always fluent in French, but in Guadeloupean Creole.

Today, the question as to whether French and Creole are stable in Guadeloupe, i.e. whether both languages are practiced widely and competently throughout society, remains a subject of active research.

=== Religion ===

Figures in 2020 state that 96% of the population was Christian (of these, approximately 86% were Roman Catholic, 8% Protestant and 6% other Christian); of the other 4%, most were not religious. Guadeloupe is in the Catholic diocese of Basse-Terre (et Pointe-à-Pitre).

In 1685, the Black Code announced the Christian religion in its Catholic form as the only authorized religion in the French West Indies, thus excluding Jews and the various Protestant groups from practicing their beliefs, and imposed the forced conversion of the newly arrived slaves and the baptism of the older ones. Guadeloupe adopted the code on 10 December 1685.

This was followed by a rapid fashion among the slaves, since this religion offered them a spiritual refuge and allowed them to safeguard some of their African beliefs and customs, thus marking the beginning of a religious syncretism. Since the 1970s, new religions and groups have been &#x27;competing&#x27; with the Catholic Church, such as the Evangelical Pentecostal Church, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Bible Students or Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons).

Administratively, the territory of Guadeloupe is part of the Diocese of Basse-Terre and Pointe-à-Pitre, attached to the Catholic Church in France. The diocese includes the territories of Guadeloupe, St. Barthélemy and St. Martin and the number of faithful is estimated at 400,000. In 2020 there were 59 priests active in the diocese. The episcopal see is located in Basse-Terre, in the cathedral of Notre-Dame-de-Guadeloupe.

Hinduism, which accompanied the Indians who came to work in Guadeloupe in the mid-19th century, has expanded since the 1980s. The Indian community has its own tradition that comes from India. It is the mayé men, a distorted pronunciation of the name of the Tamil Indian goddess Mariamman. There are no less than 400 temples in the archipelago.

Islam was first Institutionalized in the French West Indies by the 1970s, first in Martinique. According to the president of the Muslim association of Guadeloupe, there are between 2,500 and 3,000 Muslims in the department. The island has two mosques. Judaism has been present in Guadeloupe since the arrival of Dutch settlers expelled from the northeast of present-day Brazil in 1654. There is a synagogue and an Israelite cultural community. Guadeloupeans of Syrian and Lebanese origin practice Catholicism in its Maronite form. Rastafari has been attractive to some young people since the 1970s following its emergence in Jamaica. The quimbois or kenbwa, practiced in Guadeloupe, refer to magical-religious practices derived from Christian and African syncretism.

=== Literature ===

Guadeloupe has always had a rich literary output, with Guadeloupean author Saint-John Perse winning the 1960 Nobel Prize in Literature. Other prominent writers from Guadeloupe or of Guadeloupean descent include Maryse Condé, Simone Schwarz-Bart, Myriam Warner-Vieyra, Oruno Lara, Daniel Maximin, Paul Niger, Guy Tirolien and Nicolas-Germain Léonard.

=== Music ===

Music and dance are also very popular, and the interaction of African, French and Indian cultures has given birth to some original new forms specific to the archipelago, most notably zouk music. Since the 1970s, Guadeloupean music has increasingly claimed the local language, Guadeloupean Creole as the preferred language of popular music. Islanders enjoy many local dance styles including zouk, zouk-love, compas, as well as the modern international genres such as hip hop, etc.

Traditional Guadeloupean music includes biguine, kadans, cadence-lypso, and gwo ka. Popular music artists and bands such as Experience 7, Francky Vincent, Kassav&#x27; (which included Patrick St-Eloi, and Gilles Floro) embody the more traditional music styles of the island, whilst other musical artists such as the punk band The Bolokos (1) or Tom Frager focus on more international genres such as rock or reggae. Many international festivals take place in Guadeloupe, such as the Creole Blues Festival on Marie-Galante. All the Euro-French forms of art are also ubiquitous, enriched by other communities from Brazil, Dominican Republic, Haiti, India, Lebanon, Syria who have migrated to the islands.

Classical music has seen a resurgent interest in Guadeloupe. One of the first known composers of African origin was born in Guadeloupe, Le Chevalier de Saint-Georges, a contemporary of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and a celebrated figure in Guadeloupe. Several monuments and cites are dedicated to Saint-Georges in Guadeloupe, and there is an annual music festival, Festival International de Musique Saint-Georges, dedicated in his honour. The festival attracts classical musicians from all over the world and is one of the largest classical music festivals in the Caribbean.Another element of Guadeloupean culture is its dress. A few women (particularly of the older generation) wear a unique style of traditional dress, with many layers of colourful fabric, now only worn on special occasions. On festive occasions they also wore a madras (originally a &quot;kerchief&quot; from South India) headscarf tied in many different symbolic ways, each with a different name. The headdress could be tied in the &quot;bat&quot; style, or the &quot;firefighter&quot; style, as well as the &quot;Guadeloupean woman&quot;. Jewellery, mainly gold, is also important in the Guadeloupean lady&#x27;s dress, a product of European, African and Indian inspiration.

=== Traditional dress ===
Traditional dress, inherited today, is the result of a long cultural mix involving Africa, Asia and Europe. This cultural mix was initially based on triangular trade and later on a more globalized trade that included importing fabrics from the Orient. For example, in the traditional Guadeloupean costume, we find Asian influences with the use of madras cloth from India, African and European influences (Spanish in this case) with the use of the headscarf for covering and again European influences (French in this case) in the adoption of the lace petticoat from Brittany.

The clothing worn in Guadeloupe has mutated over the centuries and has undergone changes that reflect the social conditions and the evolution of society, from the time of slavery to the present day. During the second half of the 17th century, slaves arriving in Guadeloupe were naked or nearly naked. They were then forced to wear rags or the owner&#x27;s worn-out clothes, which were quickly discarded, barely concealing their nakedness. Or slaves working in the fields wore the &quot;three-hole&quot; dress, made of a vegetable fiber fabric in which three holes were made (two for the arms and one for the head). Under pressure from the church and the authorities, slaves were forced to wear the &quot;three-hole&quot; dress.

Under pressure from the church and as soon as the Black Code was enforced in 1685, owners were required to provide &quot;each slave with two suits of cloth or four alders [about ] of cloth a year... art.25&quot; which only modestly improved their conditions. However, the poor quality of the clothing worn during slavery must be qualified, as it could vary according to the day of the week (daily clothing, Sunday clothing, clothing for special occasions), or according to the status of the slaves employed in the houses.

In fact, the latter could be dressed in clothes of different quality according to the job they performed on the property. For example, in the case of the maids, their clothes could be of better quality because they had to reflect the image of success and wealth that their master wanted to project.

From the 17th century onwards, the development of the Creole costume coincided with the desire of slave women to regain their dignity, with the evolution of their employment within the household or Guadeloupean society (specialization in the sewing and dressmaking trades), with the evolution of Guadeloupean society (free women of colour, freed slaves, mulatto women) and with the influence of the European fashionable costume, which the housewife represented.

After the abolition of slavery, the main periods of traditional Guadeloupean dress were the following:

* 1848 to 1930, establishment of the use of the costume;
* From 1930 to 1950, significant decrease in the use of the traditional costume;
* From 1950 to 1960, period in which the traje becomes a &quot;folkloric&quot; garment;
* From 1960 to the present, the traditional costume has been recovered and is valued both as an everyday garment and as a sign of attachment to the culture of Guadalupe.53 Today, many designers are inspired by the traditional costume to make some of their creations.

As a result of this fusion of African and European dress codes over the centuries, including materials from distant origins, the Guadeloupean wardrobe includes Creole garments such as: the cozy dress or wòb ti-do, an everyday dress also called &quot;à corps&quot; because it fits the body like a corset; the skirt-shirt, in ceremonial dress (the shirt is made of very fine batiste trimmed with lace, which stops at the elbows and is buttoned with golden buttons. The skirt, full and very wide in the back with tail, is knotted above the breasts); the bodice dress which is distinguished from the others by the quantity and richness of the fabric used (satin, brocade satin, satin).

* The traditional headdress, worn with or without the women&#x27;s traditional costume, is the subject of a precise codification:
* The &quot;tête chaudière&quot; is the ceremonial headdress with a round, flat shape, topped with a spiked knot;
* The four-pointed headdress (headdress with four knots) means &quot;my heart has room for whoever wants it!&quot;;
* The three-pointed headdress means &quot;my heart is taken!&quot;;
* The two-pointed headdress means &quot;my heart is compromised, but you can try your luck!&quot;;
* The one-ended headdress means &quot;my heart is free!&quot;

=== Gastronomy ===
Guadeloupean cuisine is a mixture of African, European and Asian influences. It uses first of all agricultural products such as poyo (plantain more commonly called green plantain or ti-nain), bread plantain, okra, cabbage, pigeon peas, cristofina, yam or sweet potato.

The sea and rivers provide rays, snappers, octopus (chatou), lambis, burgots (a type of large whelk), sea urchins and ouassous. Orchards provide fruits such as soursop, red jambosier, passion fruit (marakoudja), mango, quenette, and citrus. Condiments sometimes added to dishes are habanero chili, cive (a kind of onion from the country) or roucou seeds that give a red tint to sauces.

The cooking, often spicy and seasoned, results from soaking meat or fish for hours before cooking, to enhance its flavour. Typical dishes are: fish blaff, dombrés, bébélé (from Marie-Galante), colombo (equivalent to Indian curry) and matété (rice cooked with crab). As for appetizers or snacks, there are morcillas criollas, accras, cassava cakes and bokit.

As for desserts, there are blancmange, sorbets or various fruit salads. Pastries include pâtés with jam, tournament d&#x27;amour (in Les Saintes), caca bœuf (in Marie-Galante) or sacristain. &quot;Pain natté&quot;, a local brioche bread, is often eaten.

There are local productions of candied fruits (elderberry, pineapple, carambola) and jams (guava, banana, coconut). Sorbets such as coconut sherbet or snowball made with crushed ice to which a syrup (mint, grenadine) is added are also consumed. Sweets include coconut sugar, kilibibi and konkada (of Beninese origin).In the category of beverages, the consumption of soft drinks is very important in Guadeloupe, as well as that of a drink locally nicknamed black beer. In addition, it is not uncommon to see vendors of sugar cane juice or coconut water on the roads. Chaudeau is consumed on special occasions (weddings, baptisms, communions) and is a Guadeloupean-style eggnog eaten with a whipped cake (génoise). The rum, whose consumption is culturally imbricated in the Guadeloupean society, comes in particular from one of the ten distilleries distributed in the Guadeloupean territory and that produce the rums of Guadeloupe.

=== Festivities ===
At Christmas, families and friends gather during the chanté Nwel, an opportunity to sing carols and celebrate. After the vacations, rehearsals begin for the Guadeloupe carnival. Carnival groups parade through the streets every Sunday afternoon until the Carnival festivities in February or March. For example, the groups with skins, the Akiyo group are groups composed only of large percussion and lambi shell instruments. They have the particularity of having no brass instruments in the band, no choreography, they often parade without themed costumes. Since 2014, the Carnival in kabwèt of Marie-Galante has been registered in the inventory of the intangible heritage of France at UNESCO.

Shrove Tuesday is the big party where carnival groups compete in the main town, Basse-Terre, or in Pointe-à-Pitre, for the best costumes, the best music or the best choreography whose theme is imposed by the carnival committees. The next day, on Ash Wednesday, the day that ends the carnival, the mascot king of the carnival nicknamed Vaval is burned, which signals the end of the festivities, everyone parades in black and white (to mark Vaval&#x27;s mourning), and then the forty days of Lent begin. Most of the population is Catholic and respects this period. But, given the great fondness for festivities, on the &quot;Thursday of Lent&quot; a parade is organized in red and black identical to that of Carnival, with groups of musicians preceded by people parading.

After this period of deprivation, the Easter celebrations take place, during which families usually go camping on the beach and eat traditional and very popular dishes based on crabs: matété (rice cooked with crab), calalou (crabs with wooden leaves accompanied by white rice) or dombrés with crabs (small balls of flour cooked with crab).

== Sport ==

Football is popular in Guadeloupe, and several notable footballers are of Guadeloupean origin, including Marius Trésor, Stéphane Auvray, Ronald Zubar and his younger brother Stéphane, Miguel Comminges, Dimitri Foulquier, Bernard Lambourde, Anthony Martial, Alexandre Lacazette, Thierry Henry, Lilian Thuram, William Gallas, Layvin Kurzawa, Mikael Silvestre, Thomas Lemar, Mathys Tel, Kingsley Coman and David Regis.

The Guadeloupe football team were 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup semi-finalists, defeated by Mexico.

Basketball is popular. Best known players are the NBA players Rudy Gobert, Mickaël Piétrus, Johan Petro, Rodrigue Beaubois, and Mickael Gelabale (now playing in Russia), who were born on the island.

Several track and field athletes, such as Marie-José Pérec, Patricia Girard-Léno, Christine Arron, and Wilhem Belocian, are also Guadeloupe natives.

The island has produced many world-class fencers. Yannick Borel, Daniel Jérent, Ysaora Thibus, Anita Blaze, Enzo Lefort and Laura Flessel were all born and raised in Guadeloupe. According to Olympic gold medalist and world champion Yannick Borel, there is a good fencing school and a culture of fencing in Guadeloupe.

Even though Guadeloupe is part of France, it has its own sports teams. Rugby union is a small but rapidly growing sport in Guadeloupe.

The island is internationally known for hosting the Karujet Race – Jet Ski World Championship since 1998. This nine-stage, four-day event attracts competitors from around the world (mostly Caribbeans, Americans, and Europeans). The Karujet, generally made up of seven races around the island, has an established reputation as one of the most difficult championships in which to compete.

The Route du Rhum is one of the most prominent nautical French sporting events, occurring every four years.

Bodybuilder Serge Nubret was born in Anse-Bertrand, Grande-Terre, representing the French state in various bodybuilding competitions throughout the 1960s and 1970s including the IFBB&#x27;s Mr. Olympia contest, taking 3rd place every year from 1972 to 1974, and 2nd place in 1975. Bodybuilder Marie-Laure Mahabir also hails from Guadeloupe.

The country has a passion for cycling. It hosted the French Cycling Championships in 2009 and continues to host the Tour de Guadeloupe every year.

Guadeloupe continues to host the Orange Open de Guadeloupe tennis tournament (since 2011).

The Tour of Guadeloupe sailing, which was founded in 1981.

In Boxing, Ludovic Proto – as an amateur, he competed in the 1988 Summer Olympics in the men&#x27;s light welterweight division. As a professional, he was a former French and European welterweight champion;

Gilbert Delé – as a professional, he was a former French and European light-middleweight champion, then he won the WBA world light-middleweight title in 1991;

Jean-Marc Mormeck – as a professional, he was a former French light heavyweight champion and two-time unified world cruiserweight champion—held the WBA, WBC, and &quot;The Ring&quot; titles twice between 2005 and 2007.

== Transport ==
Guadeloupe is served by a number of airports; most international flights use Pointe-à-Pitre International Airport. Boats and cruise ships frequent the islands, using the ports at Pointe-à-Pitre and Basse-Terre.

On 9 September 2013 the county government voted in favour of constructing a tramway in Pointe-à-Pitre. The first phase will link northern Abymes to downtown Pointe-à-Pitre by 2019. The second phase, scheduled for completion in 2023, will extend the line to serve the university.

== Education ==
The Guadeloupe academic region includes only the Guadeloupe academy. It employs 9,618 people and its operating budget was €714.3 million for 2018–2019. The territory has 300 elementary schools, including 1 private kindergarten under contract and 14 private elementary schools under contract. It also has 52 middle schools, including 6 private under contract. And finally, it has 38 high schools, 13 of which are private under contract.

During the 2018–2019 school year were enrolled at Guadeloupe Academy:

* 45,510 students in primary education;
* 45,626 students in secondary education;
* 2,718 graduate students in high school.
* Since 2014, the academy has 12 districts divided into 5 poles:
* The Pôle Îles du Nord (St. Martin and St. Barthélemy);
* The Basse-Terre Nord Pole (Baie-Mahault, Capesterre-Belle-Eau and Sainte-Rose);
* The South Pole of Basse-Terre: Basse-Terre and Bouillante (including the islands of Les Saintes);
* The North Pole of Grande-Terre: Grande-Terre Nord, Sainte-Anne and Saint-François (including the islands of La Désirade and Marie-Galante);
* The South Pole of Grande-Terre: Les Abymes, Gosier and Pointe-à-Pitre.

The islands of Guadeloupe are also home to two campuses of the University of the French Antilles, Camp-Jacob in Saint-Claude and Fouillole in Pointe-à-Pitre, the latter being the headquarters of the institution. Student residences are located around each campus. Furthermore, a satellite campus dedicated to healthcare is located in the vicinity of the , many schools for apprentices are located throughout the archipelago, an Arts and Crafts Centre acting as local school for fine art is located in Bergevin, Pointe-à-Pitre, and, finally, three sites of the regional second chance school are implanted in various high schools.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Energy ===
The island has great potential for solar, wind and marine energy, but by 2018, biomass and coal energy and petroleum hydrocarbons are still the most used.

The Energy transition Law (TECV) provides for 50% renewable energy by 2020 in the territory. And the Guadeloupe EPP plans to develop 66 MW of additional biomass capacity between 2018 and 2023, including 43 MW to replace coal.

For example, the Albioma Caraïbes (AC) coal-fired power plant will be converted to biomass to help increase the share of renewables in Guadeloupe&#x27;s energy mix from 20.5% to 35%, thereby mitigating the island&#x27;s dependence on fossil fuels and reducing acidic air pollution and the production of toxic and bottom ash.

This 34 MW power plant, producing 260 GWh/year of electricity in 2018 (i.e. 15% of the island&#x27;s needs), should reduce 265 000 t of  equivalent/year throughout the chain (−87% once converted to biomass compared to the previous situation, coal).

Guadeloupe has an electricity production plant, in Le Moule, based on the sugar cane agricultural sector, which recovers the residues from sugar cane crushing (bagasse) to produce energy; 12 wind farms, such as in Désirade, Le Moule or Marie-Galante; a geothermal power plant in Bouillante, which uses the energy of water vapor produced by volcanic activity (the plant&#x27;s electricity production ranks it first nationally); a project to harness the energy of waves and ocean currents; photovoltaic installations that contribute to the operation of solar water heaters for homes and to the development of the electric vehicle sector.

Electricity produced by hydropower, which represents 2.2% of total production, comes from dams built on the beds of certain rivers.

=== Drinking water supply ===
The water distributed by Guadeloupe&#x27;s drinking water network comes mainly from Basse Terre, 70% from river intakes and 20% from spring catchments. The remaining 10% comes from boreholes tapping the groundwater of Grande Terre and Marie-Galante.

Access to water and sanitation is problematic due to the deteriorated state of the network, which causes many losses in the water supply system. For years, water shortages have been recurrent and have forced &quot;water shifts&quot;, mainly in the municipalities of Grande-Terre, which are the most affected, with consequences for private individuals and agricultural activities.

According to statistics from the Water Office (2020 data), 61% of drinking water production is wasted, i.e., almost 50 million cubic metres of water per year, due to pipes in poor condition. In addition, 70% of wastewater treatment plants do not meet standards.

== Police and crime ==
Although Guadeloupe is one of the safest islands in the Caribbean, it was the most violent overseas French department in 2016. The murder rate is significantly higher than that of Paris, at 8.2 per 100,000. The high level of unemployment caused violence and crime to rise, especially in 2009 and 2010, the years following the Great Recession. Residents of Guadeloupe describe the island as a place with little everyday crime, and most violence is caused by the drug trade or domestic disputes. In 2021, additional police officers were deployed to the island in the face of rioting arising out of COVID-19 restrictions.

Normally, about 2,000 police officers are present on the island including some 760 active National Gendarmerie of the COMGEND (Gendarmerie Command of Guadeloupe) region plus around 260 reservists. The active Gendarmerie include three Mobile Gendarmerie Squadrons (EGM) and a Republican Guard Intervention Platoon (PIGR). The Maritime Gendarmerie deploys the patrol boat &quot;Violette&quot; in the territory, which is planned for replacement by a new PCG-NG patrol boat in about 2025–2026.

<text>As an archipelago, Guadeloupe depends on several systems of public transport. The two islands that make up Guadeloupe proper - Grande-Terre and Basse-Terre - have an extensive road network, while water and air transportation connects to the outer islands as well as international destinations.

==Road transport==
Guadeloupe uses right-hand traffic. Of the 2,082 km of roads in the region, the majority (1,742 km) are paved and are well-maintained. As Guadeloupe is a French-administered territory, road signs and directions are written in French. The two main islands of Grande-Terre and Basse-Terre are connected by the N1 and N11 highways. Winding roads are common, and in Basse-Terre, the mountain roads have especially sharp turns.

Karu&#x27;lis operates several bus routes across Grande-Terre (including direct services to and around Basse-Terre), and a small route runs on the north-eastern island of La Désirade.

==Rail transport==
There are no public railways in Guadeloupe. A public railway line between Pointe-à-Pitre and Le Moule (Grande-Terre) was proposed but was later scrapped. Some plantations operate private railways. There exists a tourist railway that is operational (as of 2014) from Beauport, Port Louis to de Poyen. The construction of a tramway was planned with two lines: one between the Abymes and the Memorial in Pointe-à-Pître; the other between Baie-Mahault and Gosier. This project was later abandoned due to High-service buses being preferred over the tramway.

==Water transport==

The container terminal Port de Jarry, in Pointe-à-Pitre, is Guadeloupe&#x27;s primary port for cargo and cruise ship passengers. It handles more than 95% of Guadeloupe&#x27;s trade. Basse-Terre city contains a smaller sea port which also handles passengers.

Ferries connect Guadeloupe proper to the outer islands of La Désirade, Marie-Galante, and Îles des Saintes, as well as other Caribbean ports.

==Air transport==
Pointe-à-Pitre International Airport is the primary gateway for international travel into and out of Guadeloupe. It offers direct and chartered/seasonal flights to South America, the Caribbean, North America and Europe. It is a hub airport for Air Caraïbes.

<doc id="12353" wikidata="Q145625" url="?curid=12353" title="Glagolitic script">
<text>The Glagolitic script ( , , &quot;glagolitsa&quot;) is the oldest known Slavic alphabet. It is generally agreed that it was created in the 9th century for the purpose of translating liturgical texts into Old Church Slavonic by Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessalonica. He and his brother Saint Methodius were sent by the Byzantine Emperor Michael III in 863 to Great Moravia to spread Christianity there. After the deaths of Cyril and Methodius, their disciples were expelled and they moved to the First Bulgarian Empire instead. The Early Cyrillic alphabet, which developed gradually in the Preslav Literary School by Greek alphabet scribes who incorporated some Glagolitic letters, gradually replaced Glagolitic in that region. Glagolitic remained in use alongside Latin in the Kingdom of Croatia and alongside Cyrillic until the 14th century in the Second Bulgarian Empire and the Serbian Empire, and later mainly for cryptographic purposes.

Glagolitic also spread to the Kievan Rus&#x27; and the Kingdom of Bohemia, though its use declined there in the 12th century, although some manuscripts in the territory of the former retained Glagolitic inclusions for centuries. It had also spread to Duklja and Zachlumia, from which it reached the March of Verona where the Investiture Controversy afforded it refuge from the opposition of Latin rite prelates, and allowed it to entrench itself in Istria, spreading from there to nearby lands.

It survived there and as far south as Dalmatia without interruption into the 20th century for Church Slavonic in addition to its use as a secular script in parts of its range, which at times extended into Bosnia, Slavonia, and Carniola, in addition to 14th-15th century exclaves in Prague and Kraków, and a 16th-century exclave in Putna.

Its authorship by Cyril was forgotten, having been replaced with an attribution to St. Jerome by the early Benedictine adopters of Istria in a bid to secure the approval of the papacy. The bid was ultimately successful, though sporadic restrictions and repressions from individual bishops continued even after its official recognition by Pope Innocent IV. These had little effect on the vitality of the script, which evolved from its original Rounded Glagolitic form into an [[Angular Glagolitic]] form, in addition to a cursive form developed for notary purposes.

But the Ottoman conquests left the script without most of its continental population, and as a result of the Counter-Reformation its use was restricted in Istria and the Diocese of Zagreb, and the only active printing press with a Glagolitic type was confiscated, leading to a shift towards Latinic and Cyrillic literacy when coupled with the Tridentine requirement that priests be educated at seminaries. The result was its gradual death as a written script in most of its continental range, but also the unusually late survival of medieval scribal tradition for the reproduction of Glagolitic texts in isolated areas like the island of Krk and the Zadar Archipelago. Although the Propaganda Fide would eventually resume printing Glagolitic books, very few titles were published, so the majority of Glagolitic literary works continued to be written and copied by hand well into the 18th century.{{rp|9}} Of the major European scripts, only the Arabic script is comparable in this regard.

In the early 19th century, the policies of the First French Empire and Austrian Empire left the script without legal status and its last remaining centers of education were abolished, concurrent with the weakening of the script in the few remaining seminaries that used the cursive form in instruction, resulting in a rapid decline. But when the Slavicists discovered the script and established it as the original script devised by Cyril, Glagolitic gained new niche applications in certain intellectual circles, while a small number of priests fought to keep its liturgical use alive, encountering difficulties but eventually succeeding to the point that its area &quot;expanded&quot; in the early 20th century.

Latinic translations and transliterations of the matter of the missal in this period led to its decline in the decades before Vatican II, whose promulgation of the vernacular had the effect of confining regular use of Glagolitic to a few monasteries and academic institutions, in addition to a small population of enthusiasts, whose numbers grew and shrank with the prevalence of the script in literature, but grew exponentially in pious and nationalist circles in the years leading up to and following Independence of Croatia, and again more broadly with the Internet.

==Name and etymology==
The word &quot;glagolitic&quot; comes from Neo-Latin {{lang|la|glagoliticus}} and Croatian {{lang|hr|glagoljica}}, from Old Church Slavonic {{lang|cu|ⰳⰾⰰⰳⱁⰾⱏ}} (&quot;glagolŭ&quot;), meaning &quot;utterance&quot; or &quot;word&quot;.

The name &quot;glagolitsa&quot; is speculated to have developed in Croatia, around the 14th century, and was derived from the word &quot;glagoljati&quot;, literally &quot;verb (&quot;glagol&quot;) using (&quot;jati&quot;)&quot;, meaning to say Mass in Old Church Slavonic liturgy.

In the languages now spoken in the places where Glagolitic script was once used, the script is known as {{lang|bg|глаголица}} (romanized as &quot;glagolitsa&quot; or &quot;glagolica&quot;, depending on which language) in Bulgarian, Macedonian and Russian; {{lang|hr|glagoljica}} (глагољица) in Croatian and Serbian; {{lang|uk|глаголиця}} (&quot;hlaholytsia&quot;) in Ukrainian; {{lang|be|глаголіца}} (&quot;hlaholitsa&quot;) in Belarusian; {{lang|cs|hlaholice}} in Czech; {{lang|sk|hlaholika}} in Slovak; {{lang|pl|głagolica}} in Polish; and {{lang|sl|glagolica}} in Slovene and Sorbian.{{citation needed|date=November 2023}}

==History==
===Origins===




The creation of the characters is popularly attributed to Saints Cyril and Methodius, who may have created them to facilitate the introduction of Christianity. It is believed that the original letters were fitted to Slavic dialects in geographical Macedonia specifically (the Byzantine theme of Thessalonica).
The words of that language could not be easily written by using either the Greek or Latin alphabets.

The number of letters in the original Glagolitic alphabet is not known, but it may have been close to its presumed Greek model. The 41 letters known today include letters for non-Greek sounds, which may have been added by Saint Cyril, as well as ligatures added in the 12th century under the influence of Cyrillic, as Glagolitic lost its dominance. In later centuries, the number of letters dropped dramatically, to fewer than 30 in modern Croatian and Czech recensions of the Church Slavic language. Twenty-four of the 41 original Glagolitic letters (see table below) probably derive from graphemes of the medieval cursive Greek small alphabet but have been given an ornamental design.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The source of the other consonantal letters is unknown. If they were added by Cyril, it is likely that they were taken from an alphabet used for Christian scripture. It is frequently proposed that the letters &quot;sha&quot; {{Script|Glag|Ⱎ}}, &quot;tsi&quot; {{Script|Glag|Ⱌ}}, and &quot;cherv&quot; {{Script|Glag|Ⱍ}} were taken from the letters &quot;shin&quot; ש and &quot;tsadi&quot; צ of the Hebrew alphabet, and that Ⰶ &quot;zhivete&quot; derives from Coptic &quot;janja&quot; Ϫ.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} However, Cubberley suggests that if a single prototype were presumed, the most likely source would be Armenian. Other proposals include the Samaritan alphabet, which Cyril learned during his journey to the Khazars in Cherson.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

For writing numbers, the Glagolitic numerals use letters with a numerical value assigned to each based on their native alphabetic order. This differs from Cyrillic numerals, which inherited their numeric value from the corresponding Greek letter (see Greek numerals).

The two brothers from Thessaloniki, who were later canonized as Saints Cyril and Methodius, were sent to Great Moravia in 862 by the Byzantine emperor at the request of Prince Rastislav, who wanted to weaken the dependence of his country on East Frankish priests. The Glagolitic alphabet, however it originated, was used between 863 and 885 for government and religious documents and books and at the Great Moravian Academy (&quot;Veľkomoravské učilište&quot;) founded by the missionaries, where their followers were educated. The Kiev Missal, found in the 19th century in Jerusalem, was dated to the 10th century.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In 885, Pope Stephen V issued a papal bull to restrict spreading and reading Christian services in languages other than Latin or Greek. Around the same time, Svatopluk I, following the interests of the Frankish Empire and its clergy, persecuted the students of Cyril and Methodius, imprisoned and expelled them from Great Moravia.

In 886, an East Frankish bishop of Nitra named Wiching banned the script and jailed 200 followers of Methodius, mostly students of the original academy. They were then dispersed or, according to some sources, sold as slaves by the Franks. However, many of them, including Saints Naum, Clement, Angelar, Sava and Gorazd, reached the First Bulgarian Empire and were commissioned by Boris I of Bulgaria to teach and instruct the future clergy of the state in the Slavic language. After the adoption of Christianity in Bulgaria in 865, religious ceremonies and Divine Liturgy were conducted in Greek by clergy sent from the Byzantine Empire, using the Byzantine rite. Fearing growing Byzantine influence and weakening of the state, Boris viewed the introduction of the Slavic alphabet and language into church use as a way to preserve the independence of the Bulgarian Empire from Byzantine Constantinople. As a result of Boris&#x27; measures, two academies, one in Ohrid and one in Preslav, were founded.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Spread of the script===

From there, the students travelled to other places and spread the use of their alphabet. Students of the two apostles who were expelled from Great Moravia in 886, notably Clement of Ohrid and Saint Naum, brought the Glagolitic alphabet to the First Bulgarian Empire on Balkans and were received and accepted officially by Boris I of Bulgaria. This led to the establishment of the two literary schools: the Preslav Literary School and the Ohrid Literary School. Some went to Croatia (Dalmatia), where the squared variant arose and where Glagolitic remained in use for a long time. In 1248, Pope Innocent IV granted the Croatians of southern Dalmatia the unique privilege of using their own language and this script in the Roman Rite liturgy. Formally granted to bishop Philip of Senj, permission to use the Glagolitic liturgy (the Roman Rite conducted in the Slavic language instead of Latin, not the Byzantine rite), actually extended to all Croatian lands, mostly along the Adriatic coast. The Holy See had several Glagolitic missals published in Rome. Authorization for the use of this language was extended to some other Slavic regions between 1886 and 1935. In missals, the Glagolitic script was eventually replaced with the Latin alphabet, but the use of the Slavic language in the Mass continued, until replaced by modern vernacular languages.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

At the end of the 9th century, one of these students of Methodius – Saint Naum, one of the founders of the Pliska Literary School (commonly known as the Preslav Literary School, where the Bulgarian capital, along with the school, was transferred to in 893) – is often credited, at least by supporters of glagolitic precedence, for the &quot;creation&quot; or wider adoption of the Cyrillic script, which almost entirely replaced Glagolitic during the Middle Ages. The Cyrillic alphabet is derived from the Greek alphabet used at that time, with some additional letters for sounds peculiar to Slavic languages (like ⟨ш⟩, ⟨ц⟩, ⟨ч⟩, ⟨ъ⟩, ⟨ь⟩, ⟨ѣ⟩), likely derived from the Glagolitic alphabet. The decision by a great assembly of notables summoned by Boris in the year 893 in favor of Cyrillic created an alphabetical difference between the two literary centres of the Bulgarian state in Pliska and Ohrid. In the western part the Glagolitic alphabet remained dominant at first. However, subsequently in the next two centuries, mostly after the fall of the First Bulgarian Empire to the Byzantines, Glagolitic gradually ceased to be used there at all. Nevertheless, particular passages or words written with the Glagolitic alphabet appeared in Bulgarian Cyrillic manuscripts till the end of the 14th century. Some students of the Ohrid academy went to Bohemia where the alphabet was used in the 10th and 11th centuries, along with other scripts. It is not clear whether the Glagolitic alphabet was used in the Duchy of Kopnik before the Wendish Crusade, but it was certainly used in Kievan Rus&#x27;. Another use of Glagolitic is presumed in now southern Poland (Duchy of Vistula/White Croats state) and the Transcarpathia region.

===Survival and use in Croatia===

In Croatia, from the 12th century, Glagolitic inscriptions appeared mostly in littoral areas: Istria, Primorje, Kvarner, and Kvarner islands, notably Krk, Cres, and Lošinj; in Dalmatia, on the islands of Zadar, but there were also findings in inner Lika and Krbava, reaching to Kupa river, and even as far as Međimurje and Slovenia.
&quot;Hrvoje&#x27;s Missal&quot; from 1404 was illuminated in Split, and it is considered one of the most beautiful Croatian Glagolitic books. The 1483 &quot;Missale Romanum Glagolitice&quot; was the first printed Croatian Glagolitic book.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

It was believed that Glagolitsa in Croatia was present only in those areas. But, in 1992, the discovery of Glagolitic inscriptions in churches along the Orljava river in Slavonia totally changed the picture (churches in Brodski Drenovac, Lovčić, and some others), showing that use of the Glagolitic alphabet was spread from Slavonia also.

Sporadic instances aside, Glagolitic survived beyond the 12th century as a primary script in Croatian lands alone, although from there a brief attempt at reintroduction was made in the West Slavic area in the 14th century through the Emmaus Benedictine Monastery in Prague, where it survived well into the 15th century, the last manuscript with Glagolitic script dating to 1450–1452. Its use for special applications continued in some Cyrillic areas, for example in the Bologna Psalter (1230–1241), the Sinodalna 895 Menaion (1260), the RPK 312 Gospel (13th), the Karakallou Epistolary (13th), the NBKM 933 Triodion (13th), the Skopje 1511 Octoechos (13th), the BRAN 4.9.39 Miscellany (13th), the Hilandar Chrysorrhoas (13th/14th), the Mazurin 1698 Pandects (13th/14th), the Sofia Psalter (1337), the SANU 55 Epistolary (1366–1367), the RNB F.п.I.2 Psalter (14th), the Čajniče Gospel (late 14th), the Radosav Miscellany (1444–1461), the Prague NM IX.F.38 Psalter (18th) and in the initials of many manuscripts of the Prophets with Commentary dating to the late 15th and early 16th centuries from Muscovy and Russia. Most later use in the Cyrillic world was for cryptographic purposes, such as in the Krushedol Miscellany (15th), the RNB F.п.I.48 Prologue (1456), the Piskarev 59 Isaac (1472), the Shchukin 511 Miscellany (1511) and the Hludov Gospel (17th/18th).

The early development of the Glagolitic minuscule script alongside the increasingly square majuscule is poorly documented, but a mutual relationship evolved between the two varieties; the majuscule being used primarily for inscriptions and higher liturgical uses, and the minuscule being used in both religious and secular documents. Ignoring the problematic early Slavonian inscriptions, the use of the Glagolitic script at its peak before the Croatian-Ottoman wars corresponded roughly to the area that spoke the Chakavian dialect at the time, in addition to some adjacent Kajkavian regions within the Zagreb bishopric. As a result, vernacular impact on the liturgical language and script largely stems from Chakavian sub-dialects, although South Chakavian speakers mostly used Cyrillic, with Glagolitic only in certain parishes as a high liturgical script until a Glagolitic seminary was opened in Split in the 18th century, aside from a period of time in the parish of Kučiće-Vinišće.

The Ottoman Empire&#x27;s repeated incursions into Croatia in the 15th and 16th centuries posed the first major existential threat to the script&#x27;s survival. The Counter-Reformation, alongside other factors, led to the suppression of Glagolitic in Istria in the 16th–17th centuries as well as in the Zagreb archdiocese. The Latinisation of the coastal cities and islands took much longer, where the script continued to be used by the notaries of Krk into the first decade of the 19th century, with education by rural chapters on that island ensuring the survival of the script until well after their abolition by the Napoleon administration in the second decade of the 19th century. Novitiates continued to be educated primarily in the Glagolitic script as late as the third decade of the 19th century. But without centres of education, Latin script and Italian rapidly took over, so that very little was written in the script after the third quarter of the 19th century except for ceremonial purposes, and soon very few could read the cursive script apart from a few scholars.

Because knowledge of Glagolitic became rare even in academia, most efforts surrounding Glagolitic manuscripts in the late modern period focused on transliteration and transliteration. For example, an ongoing project run by the &quot;Centre for Research in Glagolitism&quot; of the University of Zadar uses crowdsourcing to speed up the pace of transliterating cursive Glagolitic manuscripts.

===Academic debates===
{{main|Relationship of Cyrillic and Glagolitic scripts}}

The exact nature of relationship between the Glagolitic alphabet and the Early Cyrillic alphabet, their order of development, and influence on each other has been a matter of great study, controversy, and dispute in Slavic studies since the 19th century.

==Versions of authorship and name==
A once common belief was that the Glagolitic was created or used in the 4th century by St. Jerome, hence the alphabet was sometimes named &quot;Hieronymian&quot;.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

It has also acrophonically been called &quot;azbuka&quot; from the names of its first two letters, on the same model as &quot;alpha&quot; + &quot;beta&quot; (the same name can also refer to Cyrillic and in some modern languages it simply means &quot;alphabet&quot; in general). The Slavs of Great Moravia (present-day Slovakia and Moravia), Hungary, Slovenia and Slavonia were called &quot;Slověne&quot; at that time, which gives rise to the name &quot;Slovenish&quot; for the alphabet. Some other, rarer, names for this alphabet are Bukvitsa (from common Slavic word &quot;bukva&quot; meaning &quot;letter&quot;, and a suffix &quot;-itsa&quot;) and &quot;Illyrian&quot; (presumably similar to using the same anachronistic name for the Illyrian (Slavic) language).{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In the Middle Ages, Glagolitsa was also known as &quot;St. Jerome&#x27;s script&quot; due to a popular mediaeval legend (created by Croatian scribes in the 13th century) ascribing its invention to St. Jerome (342–429). The legend was partly based on the saint&#x27;s place of birth on the border of Dalmatia and Pannonia. He was viewed as a &quot;compatriot&quot; and anachronistically as belonging to the same ethnic group; this helped the spread of the cult of the saint in Dalmatia and was later used to support the idea of the presence of Slavic communities in the Eastern Adriatic Coast from ancient times, but the legend was probably firstly introduced for other reasons, like giving a more solid religious justification for the use of this script and Slavic liturgy. The theory nevertheless gained much popularity and spread to other countries before being resolutely{{clarify|date=February 2015}} disproven.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

{{blockquote|text=Until the end of the 18th century, a strange but widespread opinion dominated that the Glagolitic writing system, which was in use in Dalmatia and Istria along with neighboring islands, including the translation of the Holy Scripture, owe their existence to the famous church father St. Jerome. Knowing him as the author of the Latin Vulgate, considering him – by his own words, born on the border between Dalmatia and Pannonia (remembering that the Dalmatian borders extended well into Istria at that time) – presumed to be an Illyrian, the self-styled Slavic intellectuals in Dalmatia very early began to ascribe to him the invention of &quot;glagolitsa&quot;, possibly with the intention of more successfully defending both Slavic writing and the Slavic holy service against prosecutions and prohibitions from Rome&#x27;s hierarchy, thus using the opinion of the famous Latin Father of the Church to protect their church rituals which were inherited not from the Greeks Cyril and Methodius but unknown. We do not know who was the first to put in motion this unscientifically-based tradition about Jerome&#x27;s authorship of the Glagolitic script and translation of the Holy Scripture, but in 1248 this version came to the knowledge of Pope Innocent IV. &lt;...&gt; The belief in Jerome as an inventor of the Glagolitic lasted many centuries, not only in his homeland, i.e. in Dalmatia and Croatia, not only in Rome, due to Slavs living there... but also in the West. In the 14th century, Croatian monks brought the legend to the Czechs, and even the Emperor Charles IV believed them.|author=Jagić, Vatroslav|source=Glagolitica. Würdigung neuentdeckter Fragmente. Wien, 1890}}

The epoch of traditional attribution of the script to Jerome ended probably in 1812. In modern times, only certain marginal authors share this view, usually &quot;re-discovering&quot; one of the already-known mediaeval sources.

==Characteristics==

The phonetic values of many of the letters are thought to have been displaced under Cyrillic influence or to have become confused through the early spread to different dialects, so the original values are not always clear. For instance, the letter &quot;yu&quot; Ⱓ is thought to have perhaps originally had the sound /u/ but was displaced by the adoption of the ligature Ⱆ under the influence of later Cyrillic &quot;oѵ&quot;, mirroring the Greek &quot;ου&quot;. Other letters were late creations after a Cyrillic model. It should also be noted that Ⱑ corresponds to two different old Cyrillic letters (Ѣ and Ꙗ), present even in older manuscripts, and not to different later variants of the same Cyrillic letter in different times or places.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The following table lists each letter in its modern order, showing its Unicode representation, images of the letter in both the round and angular/squared variant forms, the corresponding modern Cyrillic letter, the approximate sound transcribed with the , the name, and suggestions for its origin. The Old Church Slavonic names follow the scientific transliteration, while the mostly similar Church Slavonic ones follow an approach more familiar to a generic English speaking reader. Several letters have no modern counterpart. The column for the angular variant, sometimes referred to as Croatian Glagolitic, is not complete as some of the letters were not used following the Croatian recension of Old Church Slavonic.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

{{clear}}
In older texts, &quot;uk&quot; ({{Script|Glag|Ⱆ}}) and three out of four &quot;yus&quot;es ({{Script|Glag|Ⱗ, Ⱘ, Ⱙ}}) also can be written as digraphs, in two separate parts.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The order of &quot;izhe&quot; ({{Script|Glag|Ⰹ, Ⰺ}}) and &quot;i&quot; ({{Script|Glag|Ⰻ}}) varies from source to source, as does the order of the various forms of &quot;yus&quot; ({{Script|Glag|Ⱔ, Ⱗ, Ⱘ, Ⱙ}}). Correspondence between Glagolitic &quot;izhe&quot; ({{Script|Glag|Ⰹ, Ⰺ}}) and &quot;i&quot; ({{Script|Glag|Ⰻ}}) with Cyrillic &quot;И&quot; and &quot;І&quot; is unknown.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The Proto-Slavic language did not have the phoneme /f/, and the letters &quot;fert&quot; ({{Script|Glag|Ⱇ}}) and &quot;fita&quot; ({{Script|Glag|Ⱚ}}) were used for transcribing words of Greek origin, and so was &quot;izhitsa&quot; ({{Script|Glag|Ⱛ}}) for the Greek upsilon.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Pre-Glagolitic Slavic writing systems==
{{main|Pre-Christian Slavic writing}}
A hypothetical pre-Glagolitic writing system is typically referred to as &quot;cherty i rezy&quot; (strokes and incisions) – but no material evidence of the existence of any pre-Glagolitic Slavic writing system has been found, except for a few brief and vague references in old chronicles and &quot;lives of the saints&quot;. All artifacts presented as evidence of pre-Glagolitic Slavic inscriptions have later been identified as texts in known scripts and in known non-Slavic languages, or as fakes. The well-known Chernorizets Hrabar&#x27;s &quot;strokes and incisions&quot; are usually considered to be a reference to a kind of property mark or alternatively fortune-telling signs. Some &quot;Ruthenian letters&quot; found in one version of St. Cyril&#x27;s life are explainable as misspelled &quot;Syrian letters&quot; (in Slavic, the roots are very similar: &quot;rus-&quot; vs. &quot;sur-&quot; or &quot;syr-&quot;), etc.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==In popular culture==
Glagolitic script is the writing system used in the world of &quot;The Witcher&quot; books and video game series. It is also featured, in various uses, in several of the point and click adventure games made by Cateia Games, a Croatian game studio.

In the 2023 PS5 game &quot;Forspoken&quot;, Athian script, the written language of the Athian continent and cultures, seems to be based upon Glagolitic script.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

It is also featured on 1 euro cent, 2 euro cent and 5 euro cent coins minted in Croatia.

<text>In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (GCD), also known as greatest common factor (GCF), of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers. For two integers , , the greatest common divisor of and is denoted formula_1. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4, that is, .

In the name &quot;greatest common divisor&quot;, the adjective &quot;greatest&quot; may be replaced by &quot;highest&quot;, and the word &quot;divisor&quot; may be replaced by &quot;factor&quot;, so that other names include highest common factor, etc. Historically, other names for the same concept have included greatest common measure.

This notion can be extended to polynomials (see &quot;Polynomial greatest common divisor&quot;) and other commutative rings (see &quot;&quot; below).

== Overview ==

=== Definition ===
The &quot;greatest common divisor&quot; (GCD) of integers and , at least one of which is nonzero, is the greatest positive integer such that is a divisor of both and ; that is, there are integers and such that and , and is the largest such integer. The GCD of and is generally denoted .

When one of and is zero, the GCD is the absolute value of the nonzero integer: . This case is important as the terminating step of the Euclidean algorithm.

The above definition is unsuitable for defining , since there is no greatest integer such that . However, zero is its own greatest divisor if &quot;greatest&quot; is understood in the context of the divisibility relation, so is commonly defined as . This preserves the usual identities for GCD, and in particular Bézout&#x27;s identity, namely that generates the same ideal as . This convention is followed by many computer algebra systems. Nonetheless, some authors leave undefined.

The GCD of and is their greatest positive common divisor in the preorder relation of divisibility. This means that the common divisors of and are exactly the divisors of their GCD. This is commonly proved by using either Euclid&#x27;s lemma, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, or the Euclidean algorithm. This is the meaning of &quot;greatest&quot; that is used for the generalizations of the concept of GCD.

=== Example ===

The number 54 can be expressed as a product of two integers in several different ways:
: formula_2

Thus the complete list of &quot;divisors&quot; of 54 is 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.
Similarly, the divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.
The numbers that these two lists have &quot;in common&quot; are the &quot;common divisors&quot; of 54 and 24, that is,
: formula_3

Of these, the greatest is 6, so it is the &quot;greatest common divisor&quot;:
: formula_4

Computing all divisors of the two numbers in this way is usually not efficient, especially for large numbers that have many divisors. Much more efficient methods are described in &quot;&quot;.

=== Coprime numbers ===

Two numbers are called relatively prime, or coprime, if their greatest common divisor equals . For example, 9 and 28 are coprime.

=== A geometric view ===

For example, a 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 rectangular area can thus be divided into a grid of 12-by-12 squares, with two squares along one edge () and five squares along the other ().

== Applications ==

=== Reducing fractions ===

The greatest common divisor is useful for reducing fractions to the lowest terms. For example, , therefore,
: formula_5

=== Least common multiple ===

The least common multiple of two integers that are not both zero can be computed from their greatest common divisor, by using the relation
: formula_6

== Calculation ==
=== Using prime factorizations ===
Greatest common divisors can be computed by determining the prime factorizations of the two numbers and comparing factors. For example, to compute , we find the prime factorizations 48 = 24 · 31 and 180 = 22 · 32 · 51; the GCD is then 2min(4,2) · 3min(1,2) · 5min(0,1) = 22 · 31 · 50 = 12 The corresponding LCM is then
2max(4,2) · 3max(1,2) · 5max(0,1) = 
24 · 32 · 51 = 720.

In practice, this method is only feasible for small numbers, as computing prime factorizations takes too long.

=== Euclid&#x27;s algorithm ===

The method introduced by Euclid for computing greatest common divisors is based on the fact that, given two positive integers and such that , the common divisors of and are the same as the common divisors of and .

So, Euclid&#x27;s method for computing the greatest common divisor of two positive integers consists of replacing the larger number with the difference of the numbers, and repeating this until the two numbers are equal: that is their greatest common divisor.

For example, to compute , one proceeds as follows:
: formula_7
So .

This method can be very slow if one number is much larger than the other. So, the variant that follows is generally preferred.

=== Euclidean algorithm ===

A more efficient method is the &quot;Euclidean algorithm&quot;, a variant in which the difference of the two numbers and is replaced by the &quot;remainder&quot; of the Euclidean division (also called &quot;division with remainder&quot;) of by .

Denoting this remainder as , the algorithm replaces with repeatedly until the pair is , where is the greatest common divisor.

For example, to compute gcd(48,18), the computation is as follows:
: formula_8
This again gives .

=== Binary GCD algorithm ===
The binary GCD algorithm is a variant of Euclid&#x27;s algorithm that is specially adapted to the binary representation of the numbers, which is used in most computers. 

The binary GCD algorithm differs from Euclid&#x27;s algorithm essentially by dividing by two every even number that is encountered during the computation. Its efficiency results from the fact that, in binary representation, testing parity consists of testing the right-most digit, and dividing by two consists of removing the right-most digit.

The method is as follows, starting with and that are the two positive integers whose GCD is sought.
# If and are both even, then divide both by two until at least one of them becomes odd; let be the number of these paired divisions.
# If is even, then divide it by two until it becomes odd.
# If is even, then divide it by two until it becomes odd.
#: Now, and are both odd and will remain odd until the end of the computation
# While do
#* If , then replace with and divide the result by two until becomes odd (as and are both odd, there is, at least, one division by 2).
#* If , then replace with and divide the result by two until becomes odd.
# Now, , and the greatest common divisor is formula_9

Step 1 determines as the highest power of that divides and , and thus their greatest common divisor. None of the steps changes the set of the odd common divisors of and . This shows that when the algorithm stops, the result is correct. The algorithm stops eventually, since each steps divides at least one of the operands by at least . Moreover, the number of divisions by and thus the number of subtractions is at most the total number of digits.

Example: (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) = (48, 18, 0) → (24, 9, 1) → (12, 9, 1) → (6, 9, 1) → (3, 9, 1) → (3, 3, 1) ; the original GCD is thus the product 6 of and .

The binary GCD algorithm is particularly easy to implement and particularly efficient on binary computers. Its computational complexity is
: formula_10
The square in this complexity comes from the fact that division by and subtraction take a time that is proportional to the number of bits of the input.

The computational complexity is usually given in terms of the length of the input. Here, this length is , and the complexity is thus
: formula_11.

=== Lehmer&#x27;s GCD algorithm ===

Lehmer&#x27;s algorithm is based on the observation that the initial quotients produced by Euclid&#x27;s algorithm can be determined based on only the first few digits; this is useful for numbers that are larger than a computer word. In essence, one extracts initial digits, typically forming one or two computer words, and runs Euclid&#x27;s algorithms on these smaller numbers, as long as it is guaranteed that the quotients are the same with those that would be obtained with the original numbers. The quotients are collected into a small 2-by-2 transformation matrix (a matrix of single-word integers) to reduce the original numbers. This process is repeated until numbers are small enough that the binary algorithm (see below) is more efficient.

This algorithm improves speed, because it reduces the number of operations on very large numbers, and can use hardware arithmetic for most operations. In fact, most of the quotients are very small, so a fair number of steps of the Euclidean algorithm can be collected in a 2-by-2 matrix of single-word integers. When Lehmer&#x27;s algorithm encounters a quotient that is too large, it must fall back to one iteration of Euclidean algorithm, with a Euclidean division of large numbers.

=== Other methods ===
If and are both nonzero, the greatest common divisor of and can be computed by using least common multiple (LCM) of and :
: formula_12,
but more commonly the LCM is computed from the GCD.

Using Thomae&#x27;s function ,
: formula_13
which generalizes to and rational numbers or commensurable real numbers.

Keith Slavin has shown that for odd :
: formula_14
which is a function that can be evaluated for complex &quot;b&quot;. Wolfgang Schramm has shown that
: formula_15
is an entire function in the variable &quot;b&quot; for all positive integers &quot;a&quot; where &quot;c&quot;&quot;d&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) is Ramanujan&#x27;s sum.

=== Complexity ===
The computational complexity of the computation of greatest common divisors has been widely studied. If one uses the Euclidean algorithm and the elementary algorithms for multiplication and division, the computation of the greatest common divisor of two integers of at most bits is . This means that the computation of greatest common divisor has, up to a constant factor, the same complexity as the multiplication.

However, if a fast multiplication algorithm is used, one may modify the Euclidean algorithm for improving the complexity, but the computation of a greatest common divisor becomes slower than the multiplication. More precisely, if the multiplication of two integers of bits takes a time of , then the fastest known algorithm for greatest common divisor has a complexity . This implies that the fastest known algorithm has a complexity of .

Previous complexities are valid for the usual models of computation, specifically multitape Turing machines and random-access machines.

The computation of the greatest common divisors belongs thus to the class of problems solvable in quasilinear time. &quot;A fortiori&quot;, the corresponding decision problem belongs to the class P of problems solvable in polynomial time. The GCD problem is not known to be in NC, and so there is no known way to parallelize it efficiently; nor is it known to be P-complete, which would imply that it is unlikely to be possible to efficiently parallelize GCD computation. Shallcross et al. showed that a related problem (EUGCD, determining the remainder sequence arising during the Euclidean algorithm) is NC-equivalent to the problem of integer linear programming with two variables; if either problem is in NC or is P-complete, the other is as well. Since NC contains NL, it is also unknown whether a space-efficient algorithm for computing the GCD exists, even for nondeterministic Turing machines.

Although the problem is not known to be in NC, parallel algorithms asymptotically faster than the Euclidean algorithm exist; the fastest known deterministic algorithm is by Chor and Goldreich, which (in the CRCW-PRAM model) can solve the problem in time with processors. Randomized algorithms can solve the problem in time on formula_16 processors (this is superpolynomial).

== Probabilities and expected value ==
In 1972, James E. Nymann showed that integers, chosen independently and uniformly from , are coprime with probability as goes to infinity, where refers to the Riemann zeta function. (See coprime for a derivation.) This result was extended in 1987 to show that the probability that random integers have greatest common divisor is .

Using this information, the expected value of the greatest common divisor function can be seen (informally) to not exist when . In this case the probability that the GCD equals is , and since we have
: formula_20

This last summation is the harmonic series, which diverges. However, when , the expected value is well-defined, and by the above argument, it is
: formula_21

For , this is approximately equal to 1.3684. For , it is approximately 1.1106.

== In commutative rings ==

The notion of greatest common divisor can more generally be defined for elements of an arbitrary commutative ring, although in general there need not exist one for every pair of elements.

* If is a commutative ring, and and are in , then an element of is called a &quot;common divisor&quot; of and if it divides both and (that is, if there are elements and in such that &quot;d&quot;·&quot;x&quot; = &quot;a&quot; and &quot;d&quot;·&quot;y&quot; = &quot;b&quot;).
* If is a common divisor of and , and every common divisor of and divides , then is called a &quot;greatest common divisor&quot; of and &quot;b&quot;.

With this definition, two elements and may very well have several greatest common divisors, or none at all. If is an integral domain, then any two GCDs of and must be associate elements, since by definition either one must divide the other. Indeed, if a GCD exists, any one of its associates is a GCD as well.

Existence of a GCD is not assured in arbitrary integral domains. However, if is a unique factorization domain or any other GCD domain, then any two elements have a GCD. If is a Euclidean domain in which euclidean division is given algorithmically (as is the case for instance when where is a field, or when is the ring of Gaussian integers), then greatest common divisors can be computed using a form of the Euclidean algorithm based on the division procedure.

The following is an example of an integral domain with two elements that do not have a GCD:
: formula_22

The elements and are two maximal common divisors (that is, any common divisor which is a multiple of is associated to , the same holds for , but they are not associated, so there is no greatest common divisor of and .

Corresponding to the Bézout property we may, in any commutative ring, consider the collection of elements of the form , where and range over the ring. This is the ideal generated by and , and is denoted simply . In a ring all of whose ideals are principal (a principal ideal domain or PID), this ideal will be identical with the set of multiples of some ring element ; then this is a greatest common divisor of and . But the ideal can be useful even when there is no greatest common divisor of and . (Indeed, Ernst Kummer used this ideal as a replacement for a GCD in his treatment of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, although he envisioned it as the set of multiples of some hypothetical, or &quot;ideal&quot;, ring element , whence the ring-theoretic term.)

<text>Gazpacho () or gaspacho (), also called Andalusian gazpacho, is a cold soup and drink made of raw, blended vegetables. It originated in the southern regions of the Iberian Peninsula and spread into other areas. Gazpacho is widely eaten in Spain and Portugal, particularly in summer, since it is refreshing and cool.

Although there are other recipes called &quot;gazpacho&quot;, such as &quot;gazpacho manchego&quot;, the standard usage implies a soup. There are also a number of dishes that are closely related and often considered variants thereof, such as ajoblanco, salmorejo, pipirrana, porra antequerana (closer to a bread soup), and cojondongo.

==History==
There are many theories as to the origin of gazpacho, including one that says it was a soup of bread, olive oil, water, vinegar, and garlic that arrived in Spain with the Romans. The word &quot;gazpacho&quot; may come from the Latin adjective caccabaceus, derived from caccabus (&quot;cauldron&quot;), attested in the works of Tertulian, Zeno of Verona and others. This word was applied in ancient Rome to a type of bread very similar to the torta de gazpacho. Once in Spain, it became a part of southern cuisine, particularly in Córdoba, Seville or Granada Castilian kingdoms, using stale bread, garlic, olive oil, salt, and vinegar, similar to ajoblanco. During the 19th century, red gazpacho was created when tomatoes were added to the ingredients. This version spread internationally and remains commonly known.

There are many modern variations of gazpacho with avocados, cucumbers, parsley, strawberries, watermelon, grapes, meat stock, seafood, and other ingredients instead of tomatoes and bread.

==Ingredients and preparation==

Most gazpacho includes stale bread, tomato, cucumbers, onion, bell peppers, garlic, olive oil, wine vinegar, water, and salt. Northern recipes often include cumin and/or (smoked sweet paprika).

Traditionally, gazpacho was made by pounding the vegetables in a mortar with a pestle; this more laborious method is still sometimes used as it helps keep the gazpacho cool and avoids the foam and silky consistency of smoothie versions made in blenders or food processors. A traditional way of preparation is to pound garlic cloves in a mortar, add a little soaked stale bread, then olive oil and salt, to make a paste. Next, very ripe tomatoes and vinegar are added to this paste. In the days before refrigeration, the gazpacho was left in an unglazed earthenware pot to cool by evaporation, with the addition of some water.

Gazpacho may be served alone or with garnishes, such as hard-boiled eggs, chopped ham (in the salmorejo variety from Córdoba), chopped almonds, cumin crushed with mint, orange segments, finely chopped green bell peppers, onion, tomato or cucumber. In Extremadura, local ham was added to the gazpacho itself rather than as a garnish; this is called . Andalusian sources say that gazpacho should be slightly chilled, but not iced.

==Variations==
The ingredients, texture, and thickness of gazpacho vary regionally and between different cooks.

Similar cold raw soups such as arjamolho in Portugal, porra antequerana and ajoblanco, are also popular in Andalusia, although not as widespread as gazpacho. Gazpacho and salmorejo are especially similar since they are both tomato-based cold soups that are widely popular in Spain; the main difference between gazpacho and salmorejo is the culinary technique used since gazpacho is a soup whereas salmorejo is an emulsion. In addition, while both dishes share the main ingredients of tomato, olive oil, bread, and garlic, gazpacho can also be prepared with cucumber, peppers, and vinegar, whereas salmorejo cannot.

&quot;Gazpacho manchego&quot;, despite its name, is a meat stew, served hot, not a variation on the cold vegetable soup.

===In Spain===

The original recipe using bread, water, vinegar, oil, and salt is traditional in the Iberian Peninsula, perhaps going back to Roman times. Every central and southern region has its own variety. The humble gazpacho became a very deeply rooted food for peasants and shepherds in Spain. The basic gazpacho gave rise to many variants, some also called gazpacho, others not; some authors have tried to classify all these variations. Gazpachos may be classified by colour: the most usual red ones (which contain tomato), white ones (which contain no tomato, but include dried fruits), and green ones (which are white but contain some spices that make them green). These variants have their basic ingredients in common, including garlic paste which works as an emulsifier, bread, olive oil, vinegar and salt. In addition to the traditional ingredients, red fruits such as strawberries, melon, etc., may be added, making the gazpacho a bit sweeter. Gazpacho may be served as a starter, main dish, or tapa.

====Arranque roteño====
A popular variation comes from the town of Rota in the province of Cádiz. During times of drought, there was not enough water to make gazpacho; thus, arranque has the same ingredients as gazpacho, but requires less water and bread, making it a sort of cream. Some people add more bread until it takes on the consistency of a dip.

====Extremaduran variations====

In Extremadura, gazpachos are a kind of purée or thick gazpacho known as &quot;cojondongo&quot;, or &quot;cojondongo del gañán&quot;, made of breadcrumbs, garlic, oil, and vinegar, then topped with chopped onions, tomato and peppers.

====La Mancha variations====

Gazpacho manchego, as its name implies, is made in the east region of La Mancha, in Albacete and nearby areas, and is popular in other areas in the center and southwest of the country.

It is a meat stew, whose main ingredients are small game animals or birds such as rabbit, hare, quail, or pigeon, and flatbread, and may include garlic, tomatoes, and mushrooms. It is cooked in a cauldron and served hot. Another well-known variant in La Mancha is gazpacho de pastor or galiano.

Some other hot meat or fish dishes from other regions are called gazpacho (gazpacho jumillano, gazpacho de Yecla, gazpacho de Requena, etc.)

====Castilian variations====
Gazpacho is often eaten during the very hot and dry summers in Castilla y León. The gazpacho made in La Moraña in the province of Ávila has large pieces of vegetables floating in a watery soup.

<doc id="12361" wikidata="Q188215" url="?curid=12361" title="Gnome">
<text>A gnome () is a mythological creature and diminutive spirit in Renaissance magic and alchemy, introduced by Paracelsus in the 16th century and widely adopted by authors, including those of modern fantasy literature. They are typically depicted as small humanoids who live underground. Gnome characteristics are reinterpreted to suit various storytellers and artists.

Paracelsus&#x27;s gnome is recognized to have derived from the German miners&#x27; legend about  or , the &quot;metallurgical or mineralogical demon&quot;, according to Georg Agricola (1530), also called (literal Latinization of &quot;Bergmännlein&quot;, &quot;mountain manikin&quot;) by Agriocola in a later work (1549), and described by other names such as (sing. ; Latinization of German ). Agricola recorded that, according to the legends of that profession, these mining spirits acted as miming and laughing pranksters who sometimes threw pebbles at miners, but could also reward them by depositing a rich vein of silver ore.

Paracelsus also called his gnomes occasionally by these names (&quot;Bergmännlein&quot;, etc.) in the German publications of his work (1567). Paracelsus claimed gnomes measured 2 spans (18 inches) in height, whereas Agricola had them to be 3 &quot;&quot; (3 spans, 27 inches) tall.

Lawn ornaments crafted as gnomes were introduced during the 19th century, growing in popularity during the 20th century as garden gnomes.

The name of the element cobalt descends from , a 16th century German miners&#x27; term for unwanted ore (cobalt-zinc ore, or possibly the noxious cobaltite and smaltite), related as mischief perpetrated by the gnome Kobel (cf. ). This &quot;Kobel&quot; is a synonym of &quot;Bergmännlein&quot;, technically not the same as kobold, but there is confusion or conflation between them.

The terms &quot;Bergmännlein&quot;/&quot;Bergmännchen&quot; or are often used in German publications as the generic, overall term for the mine spirits told in &quot;miners&#x27; legends&quot; ().

==Etymology==
The word comes from Renaissance Latin , (pl. ) which first appears in &quot;A Book on Nymphs, Sylphs, Pygmies, and Salamanders, and on the Other Spirits&quot; by Paracelsus, published posthumously in Nysa in 1566.

The term may be an original invention of Paracelsus, possibly deriving the term from Latin , itself representing a Greek , approximated by &quot;&quot;, literally &quot;earth-dweller&quot;. This is characterized by the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) as a case of &quot;blunder&quot;, presumably referring to the omission of the &quot;ē&quot; to arrive at &quot;gnomus&quot;. However, this conjectural derivation is not substantiated by any known prior attestation in literature, and one commentator suggests the truth will never be known, short of a discovery of correspondence from the author.

==Paracelsus==

Paracelsus uses &quot;Gnomi&quot; as a synonym of &quot;Pygmæi&quot; and classifies them as earth elementals. He describes them as two spans tall. They are able to move through solid earth, as easily as humans move through air, and hence described as being like a &quot;spirit&quot;. However the elementals eat, drink and talk (like humans), distinguishing them from spirits.

And according to Paracelsus&#x27;s views, the so-called dwarf () is merely &quot;monstra&quot; (deformities) of the earth spirit gnome.

Note that Paracelsus also frequently resorts to circumlocutions like &quot;mountain people&quot; (&#x27;) or &quot;mountain manikins&quot; (&quot;&#x27;&quot; ) to denote the &quot;gnomi&quot; in the German edition (1567).

==Precursors==
There was a belief in early modern Germany about beings that lurked in the mines, known as (var. , ), equatable to what Paracelsus called &quot;gnomes&quot;. Paracelsus&#x27;s contemporary, Georgius Agricola, being a supervisor of mines, collected his well-versed knowledge of this mythical being in his monograph, &quot;De amantibus subterraneis&quot; (recté &quot;De animatibus subterraneis&quot;, 1549). The (corrected) title suggests the subject to be &quot;subterranean animate beings&quot;. It was regarded as a treatise on the &quot;Mountain spirit&quot; ( by the Brothers Grimm, in &quot;Deutsche Sagen&quot;.

Agricola is the earliest and probably most reliable source on , then known as &quot;Bergmännlein&quot;, etc. Agricola&#x27;s contemporary Johannes Mathesius, a Lutheran reformist theologian, in &quot;Sarepta Oder Bergpostill&quot; (1562) uses these various mine-lore terminology in his German sermon, so that the noxious ore which Agricola called is clarified as that which German miners called (also , ), and a demon the Germans called &quot;kobel&quot; was held responsible for the mischief of its existence, according to the preacher. The &quot;kobel&quot; demon was also blamed for the &quot;&quot; or horse&#x27;s poison (cf. hippomanes, ).

==Agricola==
Agricola, in his earlier Latin work &quot;Bermanus, sive, de re metallica&quot; (first printed 1530, reprinted 1546, etc.), did delve into a limited discussion on the &quot;metallurgical or mine demon&quot; () touching on the &quot;Corona rosacea&quot; mine disaster (cf. ) and the framework of Psellosian demonology (cf. ). A Latin-German gloss in later editions identify the being he called as cypher for German (, &quot;mountain manikin&quot;, general term for earth spirit or mine spirit).

Much more details were presented in Agricola&#x27;s later Latin work &quot;De animatibus subterraneis&quot; (1549) (cf. ), known as a monograph on (&quot;mountain spirit&quot;) in the Grimms&#x27; &quot;Deutsche Sagen&quot;. The equivalent German appellations of the demons/spirits were made available by the subsequent gloss published 1563. Agricola here refers to the &quot;gnome/mine spirit&quot; is referred to by a variety of terms and phrases, such as (&quot;montain manikin&quot;, i.e., German: &quot;bergmännlein&quot;) or Greek/Latin / (German: &quot;kobel&quot;) .

The pertinent gloss, also quoted by Jacob Grimm, states that the more ferocious of the &quot;underground demons&quot; () were called in German or &quot;mountain-devil&quot;, while the milder ones were called . And the &quot;mine demon&quot; aka Bergmännlein ( ) is somehow responsible for depositing rich veins of ore (&quot;)&quot; (specifically rich silver ore).

A different entry in the gloss reveals that the &quot;metallurgical demon&quot; (&quot;daemon metallicus&quot;) or &quot;Bergmännlein&quot; is somehow responsible for leaving a rich vein of ore (), specifically a rich vein of silver.

===De animatibus subterraneis===

According to Agricola in &quot;De animatibus subterraneis&quot; (1549), these mountain-cave demons were called by the same name, &quot;cobalos&quot;, in both Greek (i.e. ) and German (i.e. var. ). The Latin form is appended in the margin (pl. , sing. ) They were thus called on account of them aping or mimicking humans. They have the penchant to laugh, while seeming to do things, without accomplishing anything. 

In classical Greek literature, &quot;kobalos&quot; () refers to an &quot;impudent rogue&quot;, or in more modern parlance, &quot;joker&quot; or &quot;trickster&quot;. The chemist J. W. Mellor (1935) had suggested &quot;mime&quot;.

These were otherwise called the , literally translatable into German as , or English as &quot;mountain manikin&quot; due to their small stature (about 2 feet). They had the appearance of old age, and dressed like miners, in laced/filleted shirt and leather apron around the loins. And although they may pelt miners with gravel/pebbles they did no real harm, unless they were first provoked.

Agricola goes on to add there are similar to the beings which the Germans called &quot;Guteli&quot; (singular: ; , var. ), which are amicable demons that are rarely seen, since they have business at their home taking care of livestock. A&quot;Gütel&quot; or is elsewhere explained as not necessarily a mountain spirit, but more generic, and may haunt forests and fields. The Hoovers render these as &quot;goblins&quot;.

Agricola finally adds these resemble the (trolls?) as they are called especially by the Swedes, said to shapeshift into the guise of human males and females, and sometimes made to serve men.

====Rosenkranz mine, Annaberg====
Purportedly a mountain demon incident caused 12 fatalities at a mine named Rosenkrans at Anneberg or rather Rosenkranz or Rosenkrone (Corona Rosacea) at Annaberg-Buchholz, in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains) in Saxony. The demon took on the guise of the horse, and killed the twelve men with its breath, according to Agricola.

====Demonology====
Agricola has a passage in &quot;Bermanus&quot; which is quoted by a modern scholar as relevant to the study of his contemporary Paracelsus. The passage contains the line basically repeated by Olaus, as &quot;there exist in ore-bearing regions six kinds of demon more malicious than the rest&quot;.

This is probably misstated or misleading, since &quot;Bermanus&quot; cites Psellus, who devised a classification of six demon classes, where clearly it is not all six, but just the fifth class of subterranean demons which are relevant to mining.

This demon class is also equatable to Agricola&#x27;s Cobali and &quot;Getuli&quot; (recté &quot;Guteli&quot;) according to commentators.

It has also been noted that Agricola distinguished the &quot;mountain devil&quot;, exemplified by Rübezahl with the small-statured &quot;Bergmännlein&quot;. Although the popular notion was that Rübezahl was indeed lord of the gnomes, as told in folktales around the Risengibirge (Giant Mountains) region in Silesia, published by 18th century folktale collector Musäus.

Agricola explaining that the &quot;mine demon&quot; or &quot;&quot; somehow deposited &quot;rich mines&quot; was mentioned above.

====Cobalt ore====
Agricola knew of certain noxious unwanted ores the Germans miners called &quot;kobelt&quot;, though he generally referred to it by the Greek term, . This &quot;cadmia&quot;/&quot;kobelt&quot; appears to have denoted a cobalt-zinc ore, but Agricola ascribes to it corrosive dangers to the miners&#x27; feet, and it is noted that smaltite, a cobalt and nickel arsenide mixture presents corrosive properties. This ore, which defied being smelted by the metallurgy of that time, may also have been cobaltite, composed of cobalt, arsenic, and sulfur.

The presence of this nuisance ore &quot;kobelt&quot; was blamed on the similar-sounding &quot;kobel&quot; mine spirits, as Mathesius noted in his preaching. The inferred etymology of &quot;kobelt&quot; deriving from &quot;kobel&quot;, which Mathesius does not quite elocute, was explicitly articulated by Johannes Beckmann in &quot;Beiträge zur Geschichte der Erfindungen&quot; (tr. English as &quot;The History of Inventions, discoveries and origins&quot;, 1797).

The &quot;kobel&quot; spirit possibly the namesake of the ore is characterized as a &quot;gnome or a goblin&quot; by science writer Philip Ball. However, 20th century dictionaries had suggested derivation from kobold, for example, Webster&#x27;s in 1911 which didn&#x27;t distinguish kobel from kobold and lumped them together, and the OED which conjectured that the ore &quot;kobolt&quot; and the spirit &quot;kobolt/kobold&quot; was the same word. An alternative etymology deriving &quot;kobolt&quot; ore from &quot;&quot;, a type of bucket mentioned by Agricola, has been suggested by Karl Müller-Fraureuth. Peter Wothers suggests that &quot;cobalt&quot; could derive (without connection to Agricola) from &quot;cobathia&quot; for noxious smoke.

===Olaus Magnus===

The erudite Swedish Olaus Magnus in his &quot;Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus&quot; (1555) also provides a chapter on &quot;demons in the mines&quot;. Although Olaus uses the term &quot;demon&quot; () and not the uninvented coinage &quot;gnome&quot;, the accompanying woodcut he provided (cf. Fig. right) has been represented as &quot;gnome&quot; in modern reference sources.

===Praetorius===
Johannes Praetorius in &quot;Anthropodemus Plutonicus&quot; (1666) devotes a chapter of considerable length to the beings he calls or &quot;earth people&quot;, and follows Agricola to a large extent. Thus he considers earth spirits to be of two types, one more evil and sinister looking. The other, more benevolent and known as &quot;bergmännlein&quot; or &quot;kobolde&quot;. He gives the measurement of what he calls the at &quot;drey viertel einer Ellen lang&quot;, perhaps shy of one and a half feet.

The mention of &quot;kobolde&quot; here as a name for the underground spirit is an unresolved contradiction to Praetorius dedicating a wholly separate chapter on the kobold as house sprite with a separate frontispiece art labeled &quot;8. Haußmänner/Kobolde/Gütgen&quot; for the house spirits.

==Folklore examples==
The anecdote of the &quot;Rosenkranz&quot; mine localized in Saxony was already given above in . This and other near modern attestations are given in Wolfersdorf&#x27;s anthology (1968) above.

German lore regarding gnomes or &quot;berggeist&quot; (mine spirits) regard them as beneficial creatures, at least if they are treated respectfully, and lead miners to rich veins of ore.

===Bergmönch of Harz and mine light===
The silver thaler minted by Duke Henry the Younger of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel which features a &quot;wild man&quot; (cf. right) was seen to reassert his claim of complete ownership of the local silver and forest resources of the Harz Mountains, probably depicting the supernatural that miners believed led them to the whereabouts of silver ore. Even though the wild man above surface could be a vague supernatural guide, it is pointed out that it must be the &quot;Bergeist&quot; burrowing underground which guides miners to exact spots. In the Harz area, it is a being or &quot;mountain monk&quot; who uses the so-called &quot;mining light ( or ) to guide miners to their quarry or to their exit. 

The lantern he holds is apparently an ignited lump of tallow (). It is also said that the Bergmönch was originally a mine supervisor who begged God to let him continue oversight of mines after death. If ignored it will angrily appear in its giant true form, with eyes as large as cartwheels, his silver lantern measuring a German bushel or .

===Communication through noises===
Nineteenth-century miners in Bohemia and Hungary reported hearing knocking in the mines. The mining trade there interpreted such noises as warnings from the kobolds to not go in that direction. Although the Hungarian (or Czech) term was not given by the informant, and called &quot;kobolds&quot; of these mines, they were stated as the equivalents of the &quot;Berggeist&quot; of the Germans.

Nineteenth-century German miners also talked of the &quot;Berggeist&quot;, who appeared as small black men, scouting ahead of miners with a hammer, and with their banging sound indicating whether veins of ore, or breaks in the veins called &#x27;faults&#x27;, and the more knocks, the richer the vein lay ahead.

There is also a experiential report of a German mine sprite communicating residents and visiting their house (cf.Kobold#Visitors from mines).

===Switzerland===
The gnomes of Swiss folklore are also associated with riches of the mines. They are said to have caused the landslide that destroyed the Swiss village of Plurs in 1618 - the villagers had become wealthy from a local gold mine created by the gnomes, who poured liquid gold down into a vein for the benefit of humans, and were corrupted by this newfound prosperity, which greatly offended the gnomes.

==Folkloristics==

Grimm discusses the Bergmänlein somewhat under the subsection of Dwarfs (&quot;Zwerge&quot;), arguing that the dwarf&#x27;s &quot;Nebelkappe&quot; (known as Tarnkappe in the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;) slipped from being known as a cape or cloak covering the body in earlier times, into being thought of as caps or head coverings in the post-medieval era. As an example, he cites the Bergmännlein wearing a pointed hat, according to Rollenhagen&#x27;s poem &quot;Froschmeuseler&quot;.

As can be glimpsed by this example, the approach of Grimm&#x27;s &quot;&quot; is to regard the lore of the various &quot;männlein&quot; or specifically &quot;Bergmännlein&quot; as essentially derivatives of the &quot;Zwerge&quot;/&quot;dvergr&quot; of pagan Germanic mythologies.

In the 1960s there developed a general controversy between this &quot;mythological school&quot; and its opponents over how to interpret so-called &quot;miner&#x27;s legends&quot;. What sparked the controversy was not over the &quot;Bergmännlein&quot; type tale per se, but over Grimms&#x27; &quot;Three Miners of Kuttenberg&quot;, who are trapped underground but supernaturally maintain longevity through prayer. Siegfried Kube (1960) argued the tale was based on ancient mythology, i.e., pagan alpine worship. This was countered by (1961) who regarded the tale as inspired by medieval Catholic notion of the purgatory. Whereas Ina-Maria Greverus (1962), presented yet a different view, that it was not based on organized church doctrine, but a world-view and faith in the miner&#x27;s unique microcosm.

Greverus at least in her 1962 piece, centered her argument on the &quot;Berggeist&quot; (instead of &quot;Bergmännlein&quot;). Grimm also uses the &quot;Berggeist&quot; apparently as a type of &quot;Zwerg&quot;, but there has been issued a caveat that the meaning of the term &quot;Berggeist&quot; according to Grimm may not necessarily coincide with the meaning used by the proletarian Greverus. and Greverus&#x27;s &quot;Bergbau und Bergmann&quot; (1967) amply discuss the &quot;Bergmännlein&quot;.

The collection of tales under the classification of &quot;Berggeist&quot; was already anticipated as far back as Friedrich Wrubel (1883). Later published &quot;Bergmanns-Sagen&quot; (1954), a collection of miner&#x27;s legends which basically adopted Wrubel&#x27;s four-part classification, except Wrubel&#x27;s Part 2 was retitled as one about &quot;Bergmännlein&quot;.

In Karl Müllenhoff&#x27;s anthology (1845), legends No. 443 &quot;Das Glück der Grafen Ranzau&quot; and No. 444 &quot;Josias Ranzaus gefeites Schwert&quot; feature the &quot;Bergmännlein-männchen&quot; or its female form &quot;Bergfräuchen&quot;.

Other collected works also bear &quot;Berggeist-sagen&quot; in the title, such as the collection of legends in Lower Saxony by Wolfersdorf (1968).

== Cultural references ==

===In Romanticism and modern fairy tales===
The English word is attested from the early 18th century. Gnomes are used in Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;. The creatures from this mock-epic are small, celestial creatures that were prudish women in their past lives, and now spend all of eternity looking out for prudish women (in parallel to the guardian angels in Catholic belief). Other uses of the term &quot;gnome&quot; remain obscure until the early 19th century, when it is taken up by authors of Romanticist collections of fairy tales and becomes mostly synonymous with the older word &quot;goblin&quot;.

Pope&#x27;s stated source, the 1670 French satire &quot;Comte de Gabalis&quot; by Nicolas-Pierre-Henri de Montfaucon de Villars, the abbot of Villars, describes gnomes as such:
The Earth is filled almost to the center with &quot;Gnomes&quot; or &quot;Pharyes&quot;, a people of small stature, the guardians of treasures, of mines, and of precious stones. They are ingenious, friends of men, and easie to be commandded. They furnish the children of the &quot;Sages&quot; with as much money, as they have need of; and never ask any other reward of their services, than the glory of being commanded. The &quot;Gnomides&quot; or wives of these &quot;Gnomes&quot; or &quot;Pharyes&quot;, are little, but very handsom; and their habit marvellously curious.
De Villars used the term &quot;gnomide&quot; to refer to female gnomes (often &quot;gnomid&quot; in English translations). Modern fiction instead uses the word &quot;gnomess&quot; to refer to female gnomes.

In 19th-century fiction, the chthonic gnome became a sort of antithesis to the more airy or luminous fairy. Nathaniel Hawthorne in &quot;Twice-Told Tales&quot; (1837) contrasts the two in &quot;Small enough to be king of the fairies, and ugly enough to be king of the gnomes&quot; (cited after OED). Similarly, gnomes are contrasted to elves, as in William Cullen Bryant&#x27;s &quot;Little People of the Snow&quot; (1877), which has &quot;let us have a tale of elves that ride by night, with jingling reins, or gnomes of the mine&quot; (cited after OED).

The Russian composer Mussorgsky produced a movement in his work &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;, (1874) named &quot;Gnomus&quot; (Latin for &quot;The Gnome&quot;). It is written to sound as if a gnome is moving about.

Franz Hartmann in 1895 satirized materialism in an allegorical tale entitled &quot;Unter den Gnomen im Untersberg&quot;. The English translation appeared in 1896 as &quot;Among the Gnomes: An Occult Tale of Adventure in the Untersberg&quot;. In this story, the &quot;Gnomes&quot; are still clearly subterranean creatures, guarding treasures of gold within the Untersberg mountain.

As a figure of 19th-century fairy tales, the term gnome became largely synonymous with other terms for &quot;little people&quot; by the 20th century, such as &quot;goblin&quot;, &quot;brownie&quot;, &quot;leprechaun&quot; and other instances of the household spirit type, losing its strict association with earth or the underground world.

===Modern fantasy literature===
* Creatures called &quot;gnomes&quot; have been used in the fantasy genre of fiction and later gaming since the mid-nineteenth century, typically in a cunning role, e.g. as an inventor.
* In L. Frank Baum&#x27;s Oz books (published 1900 to 1920), the Nomes (so spelled), especially their king, are the chief adversaries of the Oz people. They are ugly, hot-tempered, immortal, round-bodied creatures with spindly limbs, long beards and wild hair, militantly collecting and protecting jewels and precious metals underground. Ruth Plumly Thompson, who continued the series (1921 to 1976) after Baum&#x27;s death, reverted to the traditional spelling. He also featured gnomes in his book &quot;The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus&quot;. They watch over the rocks, their king is part of the Council of Immortals, and they created the sleigh bells for Santa Claus&#x27;s reindeer.
* J. R. R. Tolkien, in the legendarium (created 1914 to 1973) surrounding his Elves, uses &quot;Gnomes&quot; as the initial- but later dropped- name of the Noldor, the most gifted and technologically minded of his elvish races, in conscious exploitation of the similarity with the word &quot;gnomic&quot;. &quot;Gnome&quot; is thus Tolkien&#x27;s English loan-translation of the Quenya word &quot;Noldo&quot; (plural &quot;Noldor&quot;), &quot;those with knowledge&quot;. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Gnomes&quot; are generally tall, beautiful, dark-haired, light-skinned, immortal, and wise. They are also proud, violent, and unduly admire their own creations, particularly their gemstones. Many live in cities below ground (Nargothrond) or in secluded mountain fortresses (Gondolin). He uses &quot;Gnomes&quot; to refer to both males and females. In &quot;The Father Christmas Letters&quot; (between 1920 and 1942), which Tolkien wrote for his children, Red Gnomes are presented as helpful creatures who come from Norway to the North Pole to assist Father Christmas and his Elves in fighting the wicked Goblins.
* BB&#x27;s &quot;The Little Grey Men&quot; (1942) is a story of the last gnomes in England, little wild men who live by hunting and fishing.
* In C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; (created 1950 to 1956), the gnomes are sometimes called &quot;Earthmen&quot;. They live in the Underland, a series of caverns. Unlike the traditional, more human-like gnomes, they can have a wide variety of physical features and skin colours where some of them are either standing at 1 ft or being taller than humans. They are used as slaves by the Lady of the Green Kirtle until her defeat, at which point they return to their true home, the much deeper (and hotter) underground realm of Bism.
* The Dutch books &quot;Gnomes&quot; (1976) and &quot;Secrets of the Gnomes&quot; (1982), written by Wil Huygen, deal with gnomes living together in harmony. These same books are the basis for a made-for-TV animated film and the Spanish-animated series &quot;The World of David the Gnome&quot; (as well as the spin-off &quot;Wisdom of the Gnomes&quot;). The word &quot;gnome&quot;, in this case, is used in place of the Dutch kabouter.
* In J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series (created 1997 to 2007), gnomes are pests that inhabit the gardens of witches and wizards. They are small creatures with heads that look like potatoes on small stubby bodies. Gnomes are generally considered harmless but mischievous and may bite with sharp teeth. In the books, it is stated that the Weasleys are lenient to gnomes, and tolerate their presence, preferring to throw them out of the garden rather than more extreme measures.
* In &quot;A. Yoshinobu&#x27;s Sorcerous Stabber Orphen&quot;, the European concept of a gnome is used in order to introduce the Far Eastern notion of the &quot;Koropokkuru&quot;, a mythical indigenous race of small people: gnomes are a persecuted minority banned from learning wizardry and attending magical schools.
* In Terry Brooks&#x27; &quot;Shannara&quot; series (created 1977 to 2017), gnomes are an offshoot race created after the Great Wars. There are several distinctive classes of gnomes. Gnomes are the smallest race. In &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; they are considered to be tribal and warlike, the one race that can be the most easily subverted to an evil cause. This is evidenced by their allegiance to the Warlock Lord in &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; and to the Mord Wraiths in &quot;The Wishsong of Shannara&quot;.
* Terry Pratchett included gnomes in his &quot;Discworld&quot; series. Gnomes were six inches in height but quite strong, often inflicting pain upon anyone underestimating them. One prominent gnome became a Watchman in Ankh-Morpork as the force became more diversified under the command of Sam Vimes, with Buggy Swires appearing in Jingo. Another gnome in the series was Wee Mad Arthur a pest terminator in Feet of Clay.

===Music===

* One of the first movements in Mussorgsky&#x27;s 1874 work &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; is named &quot;Gnomus&quot; (Latin for &quot;The Gnome&quot;). It is written to sound as if a gnome is moving about, his movements constantly changing in speed.

* &quot;The Laughing Gnome&quot; is a song by English musician David Bowie, released as a single in 1967. It became a hit when reissued in 1973, in the wake of Bowie&#x27;s commercial success.
* The 1970 album &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; by English musician George Harrison has a cover image of the musician sitting among a group of garden gnomes.
* &quot;The Gnome&quot; is a song by Pink Floyd on their 1967 album &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;. It is about a gnome named Grimble Gromble.

===Games===
* In the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game, gnomes are one of the core races available for play as player characters. They are described as being smaller than dwarves and large-nosed. They have an affinity with small animals and a particular interest in gemstones. Depending on setting and subrace, they may also have a natural skill with illusion magic or engineering.
* In the &quot;Warcraft&quot; franchise (1994 to present), particularly as featured in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, gnomes are a race of beings separate from but allied to dwarves and humans, with whom they share the lands of the Eastern Kingdoms. Crafty, intelligent, and smaller than their dwarven brethren, gnomes are one of two races in Azeroth regarded as technologically savvy. It is suggested in lore that the gnomes originally were mechanical creations that at some point became organic lifeforms. In &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, gnomes are an exile race, having irradiated their home city of Gnomeregan in an unsuccessful last-ditch effort to drive out marauding foes.

=== Movies ===

* The 1967 Walt Disney movie &quot;The Gnome-Mobile&quot;
* The 2011 animated movie &quot;Gnomeo &amp; Juliet&quot;
* The 2018 animated movie &quot;Sherlock Gnomes&quot; featured gnomish versions of several classic Sherlock Holmes characters.

=== TV Shows ===

* The Disney+ Series The Santa Clauses
* The Little Troll Prince features the troll prince Bu, turning into a gnome and gnomes by the end of the special
* David the Gnome, The Wisdom of Gnomes and The New World Of the Gnomes
* Wallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl , a 2024 British stop motion animated comedy film produced by Aardman Animations and the BBC released for Christmas features a large number of robotic garden gnomes.

===Garden gnomes===

After World War II (with early references, in ironic use, from the late 1930s) the diminutive figurines introduced as lawn ornaments during the 19th century came to be known as garden gnomes. The image of the gnome changed further during the 1960s to 1970s, when the first plastic garden gnomes were manufactured. These gnomes followed the style of the 1937 depiction of the seven dwarves in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; by Disney. 
This &quot;Disneyfied&quot; image of the gnome was built upon by the illustrated children&#x27;s book classic &quot;Gnomes&quot; (1976), in the original Dutch &quot;Leven en werken van de Kabouter&quot;, by author Wil Huygen and artist Rien Poortvliet, followed in 1981 by The Secret Book of Gnomes. 
Garden gnomes share a resemblance to the Scandinavian tomte and nisse, and the Swedish term &quot;tomte&quot; can be translated as &quot;gnome&quot; in English.

===Gnome-themed parks===

Several gnome themed entertainment parks exist. Notable ones are:
* The Gnome Reserve, at West Putford near Bradworthy in North Devon, United Kingdom
* Gnomeland, at Watermouth Castle in Berrynarbor, North Devon, United Kingdom
* Gnome Magic Garden, at Colchester, United Kingdom
* Gnometown, USA in Dawson, Minnesota, United States
* The Gnome Village, at Efteling theme park in Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands
* Zwergen-Park Trusetal, in Trusetal, Germany
*Gnom&#x27;s Park in Nowa Sól, Poland.

===Gnome parades===
Gnome parades are held annually at Atlanta&#x27;s Inman Park Festival. Numerous one-off gnome parades have been held, including in Savannah, Georgia (April 2012) and Cleveland, Ohio (May 2011).

===Metaphorical uses===
* The expression &quot;Gnomes of Zurich&quot;, Swiss bankers pictured as diminutive creatures hoarding gold in subterranean vaults, was derived from a speech in 1956 by Harold Wilson, and gained currency in the 1960s (OED notes the &quot;New Statesman&quot; issue of 27 November 1964 as earliest attestation).
* Architect Earl Young built a number of stone houses in Charlevoix, Michigan, that have been referred to as gnome homes.
* A user of Wikipedia or any wiki who makes useful incremental edits without clamouring for attention is called a .

<doc id="12365" wikidata="Q508" url="?curid=12365" title="Googolplex">
<text>A googolplex is the large number 10, or equivalently, 10 or . Written out in ordinary decimal notation, it is 1 followed by 10100 zeroes; that is, a 1 followed by a googol of zeroes. Its prime factorization is 2 ×5.

==History== 
In 1920, Edward Kasner&#x27;s nine-year-old nephew, Milton Sirotta, coined the term &quot;googol&quot;, which is 10, and then proposed the further term &quot;googolplex&quot; to be &quot;one, followed by writing zeroes until you get tired&quot;. Kasner decided to adopt a more formal definition because &quot;different people get tired at different times and it would never do to have Carnera [be] a better mathematician than Dr. Einstein, simply because he had more endurance and could write for longer&quot;. It thus became standardized to 10(10100) = 1010100, due to the right-associativity of exponentiation.

==Size==
A typical book can be printed with 10 zeros (around 400 pages with 50 lines per page and 50 zeros per line). Therefore, it requires 10 such books to print all the zeros of a googolplex (that is, printing a googol zeros).
If each book had a mass of 100 grams, all of them would have a total mass of 10 kilograms. In comparison, Earth&#x27;s mass is 5.97 × 10 kilograms, the mass of the Milky Way galaxy is estimated at 1.8 × 10 kilograms, and the total mass of all the stars in the observable universe is estimated at 2 × 1052 kg.

To put this in perspective, the mass of all such books required to write out a googolplex would be vastly greater than the mass of the observable universe by a factor of roughly 5 × 1040.

=== In pure mathematics ===
In pure mathematics, there are several notational methods for representing large numbers by which the magnitude of a googolplex could be represented, such as tetration, hyperoperation, Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation, Steinhaus–Moser notation, or Conway chained arrow notation.

===In the physical universe===
In the PBS science program &quot;&quot;, , astronomer and television personality Carl Sagan estimated that writing a googolplex in full decimal form (i.e., &quot;10,000,000,000...&quot;) would be physically impossible, since doing so would require more space than is available in the known universe. Sagan gave an example that if the entire volume of the observable universe is filled with fine dust particles roughly 1.5 micrometers in size (0.0015 millimeters), then the number of different combinations in which the particles could be arranged and numbered would be about one googolplex.

 is a high estimate of the elementary particles existing in the visible universe (not including dark matter), mostly photons and other massless force carriers.

==Mod &quot;n&quot;==
The residues (mod &quot;n&quot;) of a googolplex, starting with mod 1, are:
:0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 1, 0, 1, 4, 3, 4, 10, 0, 1, 10, 9, 0, 4, 12, 13, 16, 0, 16, 10, 4, 24, 10, 5, 0, 1, 18, 25, 28, 10, 28, 16, 0, 1, 4, 24, 12, 10, 36, 9, 16, 4, 0, ... 
This sequence is the same as the sequence of residues (mod &quot;n&quot;) of a googol up until the 17th position.

<doc id="12366" wikidata="Q5309" url="?curid=12366" title="Graphite">
<text>Graphite () is a crystalline allotrope (form) of the element carbon. It consists of many stacked layers of graphene, typically in the excess of hundreds of layers. Graphite occurs naturally and is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions. Synthetic and natural graphite are consumed on a large scale (1.3million metric tons per year in 2022) for uses in many critical industries including refractories (50%), lithium-ion batteries (18%), foundries (10%), lubricants (5%), among others (17%). Under extremely high pressures and extremely high temperatures it converts to diamond. Graphite&#x27;s low cost, thermal and chemical inertness and characteristic conductivity of heat and electricity finds numerous applications in high energy and high temperature processes.
== Types and varieties ==
Graphite can occur naturally or be produced synthetically. Natural graphite is obtained from naturally occurring geologic deposits and synthetic graphite is produced through human activity.

=== Natural graphite ===
Graphite occurs naturally in ores that can be classified as either &quot;amorphous&quot; (microcrystalline) or &quot;crystalline&quot; (flake or lump/chip) which is determined by the ore morphology, crystallinity, and grain size. All naturally occurring graphite deposits are formed from the metamorphism of carbonaceous sedimentary rocks, and the ore type is due to its geologic setting. Coal that has been thermally metamorphosed is the typical source of amorphous graphite. Crystalline flake graphite is mined from carbonaceous metamorphic rocks, while lump or chip graphite is mined from veins which occur in high-grade metamorphic regions. There are serious negative environmental impacts to graphite mining.

=== Synthetic graphite ===
Synthetic graphite has high purity and is usually produced by the thermal graphitization of hydrocarbon materials at temperatures in excess of 2,100 °C, most commonly through the Acheson process. The high temperatures are maintained for weeks, and are required not only to form the graphite from the precursor carbons but also to vaporize any impurities that may be present, including hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, organics, and metals. The resulting synthetic graphite is highly purein excess of 99.9% C puritybut typically has lower density, conductivity and a higher porosity than its natural equivalent. Synthetic graphite can be formed into very large (centimeter-scale) flakes while maintaining its high purity, unlike almost all sources of natural graphite. Synthetic graphite can also be formed by other methods including by chemical vapor deposition from hydrocarbons at temperatures above , by decomposition of thermally unstable carbides, or by crystallization from metal melts supersaturated with carbon.

=== Research ===
Research and development efforts continue into new methods for the industrial production of graphite for a variety of applications, including lithium-ion batteries, refractories, and foundries, among others. Significant work has been done on graphitizing of traditionally non-graphitizable carbons. A company in New Zealand utilizes forestry waste to produce what they have termed &#x27;biographite&#x27; through a process referred to as thermo-catalytic graphitization. Another group in the United States uses a method referred to as photocatalytic graphitization to produce highly crystalline highly pure graphite for lithium-ion batteries and other applications from a variety of carbon sources.

==Natural graphite==
===Occurrence===
Graphite occurs in metamorphic rocks as a result of the reduction of sedimentary carbon compounds during metamorphism. It also occurs in igneous rocks and in meteorites. Minerals associated with graphite include quartz, calcite, micas and tourmaline. The principal export sources of mined graphite are, in order of tonnage, China, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, and Madagascar. Significant unexploited graphite resources also exist in Colombia&#x27;s Cordillera Central in the form of graphite-bearing schists.

In meteorites, graphite occurs with troilite and silicate minerals. Small graphitic crystals in meteoritic iron are called cliftonite. Some microscopic grains have distinctive isotopic compositions, indicating that they were formed before the Solar System. They are one of about 12 known types of minerals that predate the Solar System and have also been detected in molecular clouds. These minerals were formed in the ejecta when supernovae exploded or low to intermediate-sized stars expelled their outer envelopes late in their lives. Graphite may be the second or third oldest mineral in the Universe.

===Structure===
Graphite consists of sheets of trigonal planar carbon. The individual layers are called graphene. In each layer, each carbon atom is bonded to three other atoms forming a continuous layer of sp2 bonded carbon hexagons, like a honeycomb lattice with a bond length of 0.142 nm, and the distance between planes is 0.335 nm. Bonding between layers is relatively weak van der Waals bonds, which allows the graphene-like layers to be easily separated and to glide past each other. Electrical conductivity perpendicular to the layers is consequently about 1000 times lower.

There are two allotropic forms called &quot;alpha&quot; (hexagonal) and &quot;beta&quot; (rhombohedral), differing in terms of the stacking of the graphene layers: stacking in alpha graphite is ABA, as opposed to ABC stacking in the energetically less stable beta graphite. Rhombohedral graphite cannot occur in pure form. Natural graphite, or commercial natural graphite, contains 5 to 15% rhombohedral graphite and this may be due to intensive milling. The alpha form can be converted to the beta form through shear forces, and the beta form reverts to the alpha form when it is heated to 1300 °C for four hours.

===Thermodynamics===

The equilibrium pressure and temperature conditions for a transition between graphite and diamond is well established theoretically and experimentally. The pressure changes linearly between at and at (the diamond/graphite/liquid triple point).
However, the phases have a wide region about this line where they can coexist. At normal temperature and pressure, and , the stable phase of carbon is graphite, but diamond is metastable and its rate of conversion to graphite is negligible. However, at temperatures above about , diamond rapidly converts to graphite. Rapid conversion of graphite to diamond requires pressures well above the equilibrium line: at , a pressure of is needed.

===Other properties===

The acoustic and thermal properties of graphite are highly anisotropic, since phonons propagate quickly along the tightly bound planes, but are slower to travel from one plane to another. Graphite&#x27;s high thermal stability and electrical and thermal conductivity facilitate its widespread use as electrodes and refractories in high temperature material processing applications. However, in oxygen-containing atmospheres graphite readily oxidizes to form carbon dioxide at temperatures of 700 °C and above.

Graphite is an electrical conductor, hence useful in such applications as arc lamp electrodes. It can conduct electricity due to the vast electron delocalization within the carbon layers (a phenomenon called aromaticity). These valence electrons are free to move, so are able to conduct electricity. However, the electricity is primarily conducted within the plane of the layers. The conductive properties of powdered graphite allow its use as pressure sensor in carbon microphones.

Graphite and graphite powder are valued in industrial applications for their self-lubricating and dry lubricating properties. However, the use of graphite is limited by its tendency to facilitate pitting corrosion in some stainless steel, and to promote galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals (due to its electrical conductivity). It is also corrosive to aluminium in the presence of moisture. For this reason, the US Air Force banned its use as a lubricant in aluminium aircraft, and discouraged its use in aluminium-containing automatic weapons. Even graphite pencil marks on aluminium parts may facilitate corrosion. Another high-temperature lubricant, hexagonal boron nitride, has the same molecular structure as graphite. It is sometimes called &quot;white graphite&quot;, due to its similar properties.

When a large number of crystallographic defects bind its planes together, graphite loses its lubrication properties and becomes what is known as pyrolytic graphite. It is also highly anisotropic, and diamagnetic, thus it will float in mid-air above a strong magnet. (If it is made in a fluidized bed at 1000–1300 °C then it is isotropic turbostratic, and is used in blood-contacting devices like mechanical heart valves and is called pyrolytic carbon, and is not diamagnetic. Pyrolytic graphite and pyrolytic carbon are often confused but are very different materials.)

For a long time graphite has been considered to be hydrophobic. However, recent studies using highly ordered pyrolytic graphite have shown that freshly clean graphite is hydrophilic (contact angle of 70° approximately), and it becomes hydrophobic (contact angle of 95° approximately) due to airborne pollutants (hydrocarbons) present in the atmosphere. Those contaminants also alter the electric equipotential surface of graphite by creating domains with potential differences of up to 200 mV as measured with kelvin probe force microscopy. Such contaminants can be desorbed by increasing the temperature of graphite to approximately 50 °C or higher.

Natural and crystalline graphites are not often used in pure form as structural materials, due to their shear-planes, brittleness, and inconsistent mechanical properties.

==History of natural graphite use==

In the 4th millennium BCE, during the Neolithic Age in southeastern Europe, the Marița culture used graphite in a ceramic paint for decorating pottery.

Sometime before 1565 (some sources say as early as 1500), an enormous deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish, Cumbria, England, which the locals found useful for marking sheep. During the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603), Borrowdale graphite was used as a refractory material to line molds for cannonballs, resulting in rounder, smoother balls that could be fired farther, contributing to the strength of the English navy. This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and soft, and could easily be cut into sticks. Because of its military importance, this unique mine and its production were strictly controlled by the Crown.

During the 19th century, graphite&#x27;s uses greatly expanded to include stove polish, lubricants, paints, crucibles, foundry facings, and pencils, a major factor in the expansion of educational tools during the first great rise of education for the masses. The British Empire controlled most of the world&#x27;s production (especially from Ceylon), but production from Austrian, German, and American deposits expanded by mid-century. For example, the Dixon Crucible Company of Jersey City, New Jersey, founded by Joseph Dixon and partner Orestes Cleveland in 1845, opened mines in the Lake Ticonderoga district of New York, built a processing plant there, and a factory to manufacture pencils, crucibles and other products in New Jersey, described in the &quot;Engineering &amp; Mining Journal&quot; 21 December 1878. The Dixon pencil is still in production.

The beginnings of the revolutionary froth flotation process are associated with graphite mining. Included in the &quot;E&amp;MJ&quot; article on the Dixon Crucible Company is a sketch of the &quot;floating tanks&quot; used in the age-old process of extracting graphite. Because graphite is so light, the mix of graphite and waste was sent through a final series of water tanks where a cleaner graphite &quot;floated&quot; off, which left waste to drop out. In an 1877 patent, the two brothers Bessel (Adolph and August) of Dresden, Germany, took this &quot;floating&quot; process a step further and added a small amount of oil to the tanks and boiled the mix – an agitation or frothing step – to collect the graphite, the first steps toward the future flotation process. Adolph Bessel received the Wohler Medal for the patented process that upgraded the recovery of graphite to 90% from the German deposit. In 1977, the German Society of Mining Engineers and Metallurgists organized a special symposium dedicated to their discovery and, thus, the 100th anniversary of flotation.

In the United States, in 1885, Hezekiah Bradford of Philadelphia patented a similar process, but it is uncertain if his process was used successfully in the nearby graphite deposits of Chester County, Pennsylvania, a major producer by the 1890s. The Bessel process was limited in use, primarily because of the abundant cleaner deposits found around the globe, which needed not much more than hand-sorting to gather the pure graphite. The state of the art, , is described in the Canadian Department of Mines report on graphite mines and mining when Canadian deposits began to become important producers of graphite.

=== Other names ===

Historically, graphite was called black lead or plumbago. Plumbago was commonly used in its massive mineral form. Both of these names arise from confusion with the similar-appearing lead ores, particularly galena. The Latin word for lead, &quot;plumbum&quot;, gave its name to the English term for this grey metallic-sheened mineral and even to the leadworts or plumbagos, plants with flowers that resemble this colour.

The term &quot;black lead&quot; usually refers to a powdered or processed graphite, matte black in color.

Abraham Gottlob Werner coined the name &quot;graphite&quot; (&quot;writing stone&quot;) in 1789. He attempted to clear up the confusion between molybdena, plumbago and black lead after Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1778 proved that these were at least three different minerals. Scheele&#x27;s analysis showed that the chemical compounds molybdenum sulfide (molybdenite), lead(II) sulfide (galena) and graphite were three different soft black minerals.

==Uses of natural graphite==
Natural graphite is mostly used for refractories, batteries, steelmaking, expanded graphite, brake linings, foundry facings, and lubricants.

===Refractories===
The use of graphite as a refractory (heat-resistant) material began before 1900 with graphite crucibles used to hold molten metal; this is now a minor part of refractories. In the mid-1980s, the carbon-magnesite brick became important, and a bit later the alumina-graphite shape. the order of importance is: alumina-graphite shapes, carbon-magnesite brick, Monolithics (gunning and ramming mixes), and then crucibles.

Crucibles began using very large flake graphite, and carbon-magnesite bricks requiring not quite so large flake graphite; for these and others there is now much more flexibility in the size of flake required, and amorphous graphite is no longer restricted to low-end refractories. Alumina-graphite shapes are used as continuous casting ware, such as nozzles and troughs, to convey the molten steel from ladle to mold, and carbon magnesite bricks line steel converters and electric-arc furnaces to withstand extreme temperatures. Graphite blocks are also used in parts of blast furnace linings where the high thermal conductivity of the graphite is critical to ensuring adequate cooling of the bottom and hearth of the furnace. High-purity monolithics are often used as a continuous furnace lining instead of carbon-magnesite bricks.

The US and European refractories industry had a crisis in 2000–2003, with an indifferent market for steel and a declining refractory consumption per tonne of steel underlying firm buyouts and many plant closures. Many of the plant closures resulted from the acquisition of Harbison-Walker Refractories by RHI AG and some plants had their equipment auctioned off. Since much of the lost capacity was for carbon-magnesite brick, graphite consumption within the refractories area moved towards alumina-graphite shapes and Monolithics, and away from the brick. The major source of carbon-magnesite brick is now China. Almost all of the above refractories are used to make steel and account for 75% of refractory consumption; the rest is used by a variety of industries, such as cement.

According to the USGS, US natural graphite consumption in refractories comprised 12,500 tonnes in 2010.

===Batteries===
The use of graphite in batteries has increased since the 1970s. Natural and synthetic graphite are used as an anode material to construct electrodes in major battery technologies.

The demand for batteries, primarily nickel–metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries, caused a growth in demand for graphite in the late 1980s and early 1990s – a growth driven by portable electronics, such as portable CD players and power tools. Laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and smartphone products have increased the demand for batteries. Electric-vehicle batteries are anticipated to increase graphite demand. As an example, a lithium-ion battery in a fully electric Nissan Leaf contains nearly 40 kg of graphite.

Radioactive graphite removed from nuclear reactors has been investigated as a source of electricity for low-power applications. This waste is rich in carbon-14, which emits electrons through beta decay, so it could potentially be used as the basis for a betavoltaic device. This concept is known as the diamond battery.

=== Graphite anode materials ===
Graphite is the &quot;predominant anode material used today in lithium-ion batteries&quot;. Electric-vehicle (EV) batteries contain four basic components: anode, cathode, electrolyte, and separator. While there is much focus on the cathode materialslithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, etc., the anode material used in virtually all EV batteries is graphite.

===Steelmaking===
Natural graphite in steelmaking mostly goes into raising the carbon content in molten steel; it can also serve to lubricate the dies used to extrude hot steel. Carbon additives face competitive pricing from alternatives such as synthetic graphite powder, petroleum coke, and other forms of carbon. A carbon raiser is added to increase the carbon content of the steel to a specified level. An estimate based on USGS&#x27;s graphite consumption statistics indicates that steelmakers in the US used 10,500 tonnes in this fashion in 2005.

===Brake linings===
Natural amorphous and fine flake graphite are used in brake linings or brake shoes for heavier (nonautomotive) vehicles, and became important with the need to substitute for asbestos. This use has been important for quite some time, but nonasbestos organic (NAO) compositions are beginning to reduce graphite&#x27;s market share. A brake-lining industry shake-out with some plant closures has not been beneficial, nor has an indifferent automotive market. According to the USGS, US natural graphite consumption in brake linings was 6,510 tonnes in 2005.

===Foundry facings and lubricants===
A foundry-facing mold wash is a water-based paint of amorphous or fine flake graphite. Painting the inside of a mold with it and letting it dry leaves a fine graphite coat that will ease the separation of the object cast after the hot metal has cooled. Graphite lubricants are specialty items for use at very high or very low temperatures, as forging die lubricant, an antiseize agent, a gear lubricant for mining machinery, and to lubricate locks. Having low-grit graphite, or even better, no-grit graphite (ultra high purity), is highly desirable. It can be used as a dry powder, in water or oil, or as colloidal graphite (a permanent suspension in a liquid). An estimate based on USGS graphite consumption statistics indicates that 2,200 tonnes were used in this fashion in 2005. Metal can also be impregnated into graphite to create a self-lubricating alloy for application in extreme conditions, such as bearings for machines exposed to high or low temperatures.

===Everyday use===

====Pencils====

The ability to leave marks on paper and other objects gave graphite its name, given in 1789 by German mineralogist Abraham Gottlob Werner. It stems from &quot;γράφειν (&quot;graphein&quot;)&quot;, meaning &quot;to write&quot; or &quot;draw&quot; in Ancient Greek.

From the 16th century, all pencils were made with leads of English natural graphite, but modern pencil lead is most commonly a mix of powdered graphite and clay; it was invented by Nicolas-Jacques Conté in 1795. It is chemically unrelated to the metal lead, whose ores had a similar appearance, hence the continuation of the name. Plumbago is another older term for natural graphite used for drawing, typically as a lump of the mineral without a wood casing. The term plumbago drawing is normally restricted to 17th and 18th-century works, mostly portraits.

Today, pencils are still a small but significant market for natural graphite. Around 7% of the 1.1 million tonnes produced in 2011 was used to make pencils. Low-quality amorphous graphite is used and sourced mainly from China.

In art, graphite is typically used to create detailed and precise drawings, as it allows for a wide range of values (light to dark) to be achieved. It can also be used to create softer, more subtle lines and shading. Graphite is popular among artists because it is easy to control, easy to erase, and produces a clean, professional look. It is also relatively inexpensive and widely available. Many artists use graphite in conjunction with other media, such as charcoal or ink, to create a range of effects and textures in their work. Graphite of various hardness or softness results in different qualities and tones when used as an artistic medium.

====Pinewood derby====
Graphite is probably the most-used lubricant in pinewood derbies.

===Other uses===
Natural graphite has found uses in zinc-carbon batteries, electric motor brushes, and various specialized applications. Railroads would often mix powdered graphite with waste oil or linseed oil to create a heat-resistant protective coating for the exposed portions of a steam locomotive&#x27;s boiler, such as the smokebox or lower part of the firebox. The Scope soldering iron uses a graphite tip as its heating element.

===Expanded graphite===
Expanded graphite is made by immersing natural flake graphite in a bath of chromic acid, then concentrated sulfuric acid, which forces the crystal lattice planes apart, thus expanding the graphite. The expanded graphite can be used to make graphite foil or used directly as a &quot;hot top&quot; compound to insulate molten metal in a ladle or red-hot steel ingots and decrease heat loss, or as firestops fitted around a fire door or in sheet metal collars surrounding plastic pipe (during a fire, the graphite expands and chars to resist fire penetration and spread), or to make high-performance gasket material for high-temperature use. After being made into graphite foil, the foil is machined and assembled into the bipolar plates in fuel cells.
The foil is made into heat sinks for laptop computers which keeps them cool while saving weight, and is made into a foil laminate that can be used in valve packings or made into gaskets. Old-style packings are now a minor member of this grouping: fine flake graphite in oils or greases for uses requiring heat resistance. A GAN estimate of current US natural graphite consumption in this end-use is 7,500 tonnes.

===Intercalated graphite===
Graphite forms intercalation compounds with some metals and small molecules. In these compounds, the host molecule or atom gets &quot;sandwiched&quot; between the graphite layers, resulting in a type of compound with variable stoichiometry. A prominent example of an intercalation compound is potassium graphite, denoted by the formula KC8. Some graphite intercalation compounds are superconductors. The highest transition temperature (by June 2009) &quot;T&quot;c = 11.5 K is achieved in CaC6, and it further increases under applied pressure (15.1 K at 8 GPa). Graphite&#x27;s ability to intercalate lithium ions without significant damage from swelling is what makes it the dominant anode material in lithium-ion batteries.

==History of synthetic graphite==

===Invention of a process to produce synthetic graphite===
In 1893, Charles Street of Le Carbone discovered a process for making artificial graphite. In the mid-1890s, Edward Goodrich Acheson (1856–1931) accidentally invented another way to produce synthetic graphite after synthesizing carborundum (also called silicon carbide). He discovered that overheating carborundum, as opposed to pure carbon, produced almost pure graphite. While studying the effects of high temperature on carborundum, he had found that silicon vaporizes at about , leaving the carbon behind in graphitic carbon. This graphite became valuable as a lubricant.

Acheson&#x27;s technique for producing silicon carbide and graphite is named the Acheson process. In 1896, Acheson received a patent for his method of synthesizing graphite, and in 1897 started commercial production. The Acheson Graphite Co. was formed in 1899.

Synthetic graphite can also be prepared from polyimide and then commercialized.

===Scientific research===

Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) is the highest-quality synthetic form of graphite. It is used in scientific research, in particular, as a length standard for the calibration of scanning probe microscopes.

===Electrodes===
Graphite electrodes carry the electricity that melts scrap iron and steel, and sometimes direct-reduced iron (DRI), in electric arc furnaces, which are the vast majority of steel furnaces. They are made from petroleum coke after it is mixed with coal tar pitch. They are extruded and shaped, then baked to carbonize the binder (pitch). This is finally graphitized by heating it to temperatures approaching , at which the carbon atoms arrange into graphite. They can vary in size up to long and in diameter. An increasing proportion of global steel is made using electric arc furnaces, and the electric arc furnace itself is becoming more efficient, making more steel per tonne of electrode. An estimate based on USGS data indicates that graphite electrode consumption was in 2005.

Electrolytic aluminium smelting also uses graphitic carbon electrodes. On a much smaller scale, synthetic graphite electrodes are used in electrical discharge machining (EDM), commonly to make injection molds for plastics.

===Powder and scrap===
The powder is made by heating powdered petroleum coke above the temperature of graphitization, sometimes with minor modifications. The graphite scrap comes from pieces of unusable electrode material (in the manufacturing stage or after use) and lathe turnings, usually after crushing and sizing. Most synthetic graphite powder goes to carbon raising in steel (competing with natural graphite), with some used in batteries and brake linings. According to the United States Geographical Survey, US synthetic graphite powder and scrap production were in 2001 (latest data).

It is possible to create battery-grade graphite by recycling the numerous fines from battery production. The process involves spray drying the fines over petroleum pitch with a binder and cross-linking agent, then drying them.

===Neutron moderator===

Special grades of synthetic graphite, such as Gilsocarbon, also find use as a matrix and neutron moderator within nuclear reactors. Its low neutron cross-section also recommends it for use in proposed fusion reactors. Care must be taken that reactor-grade graphite is free of neutron absorbing materials such as boron, widely used as the seed electrode in commercial graphite deposition systems – this caused the failure of the Germans&#x27; World War II graphite-based nuclear reactors. Since they could not isolate the difficulty they were forced to use far more expensive heavy water moderators. Graphite used for nuclear reactors is often referred to as nuclear graphite. Herbert G. McPherson, a Berkeley trained physicist at National Carbon, a division of Union Carbide, was key in confirming a conjecture of Leo Szilard that boron impurities even in &quot;pure&quot; graphite were responsible for a neutron absorption cross-section in graphite that compromised U-235 chain reactions. McPherson was aware of the presence of impurities in graphite because, with the use of Technicolor in cinematography, the spectra of graphite electrode arcs used in movie projectors required impurities to enhance emission of light in the red region to display warmer skin tones on the screen. Thus, had it not been for color movies, chances are that the first sustained natural U chain reaction would have required a heavy water moderated reactor.

===Other uses===
Graphite (carbon) fiber and carbon nanotubes are also used in carbon fiber reinforced plastics, and in heat-resistant composites such as reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC). Commercial structures made from carbon fiber graphite composites include fishing rods, golf club shafts, bicycle frames, sports car body panels, the fuselage of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and pool cue sticks and have been successfully employed in reinforced concrete. The mechanical properties of carbon fiber graphite-reinforced plastic composites and grey cast iron are strongly influenced by the role of graphite in these materials. In this context, the term &quot;(100%) graphite&quot; is often loosely used to refer to a pure mixture of carbon reinforcement and resin, while the term &quot;composite&quot; is used for composite materials with additional ingredients.

Modern smokeless powder is coated in graphite to prevent the buildup of static charge.

Graphite has been used in at least three radar absorbent materials. It was mixed with rubber in Sumpf and Schornsteinfeger, which were used on U-boat snorkels to reduce their radar cross section. It was also used in tiles on early F-117 Nighthawk stealth strike fighters.

Graphite composites are used as absorber for high-energy particles, for example in the Large Hadron Collider beam dump.

Glassworking tools are often made from graphite since it will not stick to hot molten glass, unlike metal tools and moulds which require coatings or lubricants, which are themselves often graphite-based. Automated glassworking machines make significant use of graphite for handling the molten glass and freshly formed items.

==Graphite mining, beneficiation, and milling==

Graphite is mined by both open pit and underground methods. Graphite usually needs beneficiation. This may be carried out by hand-picking the pieces of gangue (rock) and hand-screening the product or by crushing the rock and floating out the graphite. Beneficiation by flotation encounters the difficulty that graphite is very soft and &quot;marks&quot; (coats) the particles of gangue. This makes the &quot;marked&quot; gangue particles float off with the graphite, yielding impure concentrate. There are two ways of obtaining a commercial concentrate or product: repeated regrinding and floating (up to seven times) to purify the concentrate, or by acid leaching (dissolving) the gangue with hydrofluoric acid (for a silicate gangue) or hydrochloric acid (for a carbonate gangue).
In milling, the incoming graphite products and concentrates can be ground before being classified (sized or screened), with the coarser flake size fractions (below 8 mesh, 8–20 mesh, 20–50 mesh) carefully preserved, and then the carbon contents are determined. Some standard blends can be prepared from the different fractions, each with a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. Custom blends can also be made for individual customers who want a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. If flake size is unimportant, the concentrate can be ground more freely. Typical end products include a fine powder for use as a slurry in oil drilling and coatings for foundry molds, carbon raiser in the steel industry (Synthetic graphite powder and powdered petroleum coke can also be used as carbon raiser). Environmental impacts from graphite mills consist of air pollution including fine particulate exposure of workers and also soil contamination from powder spillages leading to heavy metal contamination of soil.

According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), world production of natural graphite in 2016 was 1,200,000 tonnes, of which the following major exporters are: China (780,000 t), India (170,000 t), Brazil (80,000 t), Turkey (32,000 t) and North Korea (6,000 t). Graphite is not currently mined in the United States, but there are many historical mine sites including ones in Alabama, Montana, and in the Adirondacks of NY. Westwater Resources is in the development stages of creating a pilot plant for their Coosa Graphite Mine near Sylacauga, Alabama. U.S. production of synthetic graphite in 2010 was 134,000 t valued at $1.07 billion.

=== Occupational safety ===

Potential health effects include: 
*Inhalation: No inhalation hazard in manufactured and shipped state. Dust and fumes generated from the material can enter the body by inhalation. High concentrations of dust and fumes may irritate the throat and respiratory system and cause coughing. Frequent inhalation of fume/dust over a long period of time increases the risk of developing lung diseases. Prolonged and repeated overexposure to dust can lead to pneumoconiosis. Pre-existing pulmonary disorders, such as emphysema, may possibly be aggravated by prolonged exposure to high concentrations of graphite dusts.
*Eye contact: Dust in the eyes will cause irritation. Exposed may experience eye tearing, redness, and discomfort.
*Skin contact: Under normal conditions of intended use, this material does not pose a risk to health. Dust may irritate skin.
*Ingestion: Not relevant, due to the form of the product in its manufactured and shipped state. However, ingestion of dusts generated during working operations may cause nausea and vomiting.
*Potential physical / chemical effects: Bulk material is non-combustible. The material may form dust and can accumulate electrostatic charges, which may cause an electrical spark (ignition source). High dust levels may create potential for explosion.

====United States====
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for graphite exposure in the workplace as a time weighted average (TWA) of 15million particles per cubic foot (1.5 mg/m3) over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 2.5 mg/m3 respirable dust over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 1250 mg/m3, graphite is immediately dangerous to life and health.

== Graphite recycling ==
The most common way of recycling graphite occurs when synthetic graphite electrodes are either manufactured and pieces are cut off or lathe turnings are discarded for reuse, or the electrode (or other materials) are used all the way down to the electrode holder. A new electrode replaces the old one, but a sizeable piece of the old electrode remains. This is crushed and sized, and the resulting graphite powder is mostly used to raise the carbon content of molten steel.

Graphite-containing refractories are sometimes also recycled, but often are not due to their low graphite content: the largest-volume items, such as carbon-magnesite bricks that contain only 15–25% graphite, usually contain too little graphite to be worthwhile to recycle. However, some recycled carbon–magnesite brick is used as the basis for furnace-repair materials, and also crushed carbon–magnesite brick is used in slag conditioners.

While crucibles have a high graphite content, the volume of crucibles used and then recycled is very small.

A high-quality flake graphite product that closely resembles natural flake graphite can be made from steelmaking kish. Kish is a large-volume near-molten waste skimmed from the molten iron feed to a basic oxygen furnace and consists of a mix of graphite (precipitated out of the supersaturated iron), lime-rich slag, and some iron. The iron is recycled on-site, leaving a mixture of graphite and slag. The best recovery process uses hydraulic classification (which utilizes a flow of water to separate minerals by specific gravity: graphite is light and settles nearly last) to get a 70% graphite rough concentrate. Leaching this concentrate with hydrochloric acid gives a 95% graphite product with a flake size ranging from 10 mesh (2 mm) down.

==Research and innovation in graphite technologies==
Globally, over 60,000 patent families in graphite technologies were filed from 2012 to 2021. Patents were filed by applicants from over 60 countries and regions. However, graphite-related patent families originated predominantly from just a few countries. China was the top contributor with more than 47,000 patent families, accounting for four in every five graphite patent families filed worldwide in the last decade. Among other leading countries were Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United States and the Russian Federation. Together, these top five countries of applicant origin accounted for 95 percent of global patenting output related to graphite.

Among the different graphite sources, flake graphite has the highest number of patent families, with more than 5,600 filed worldwide from 2012 to 2021. Supported by active research from its commercial entities and research institutions, China is the country most actively exploiting flake graphite and has contributed to 85 percent of global patent filings in this area.

At the same time, innovations exploring new synthesis methods and uses for artificial graphite are gaining interest worldwide, as countries seek to exploit the superior material qualities associated with this man-made substance and reduce reliance on the natural material. Patenting activity is strongly led by commercial entities, particularly world-renowned battery manufacturers and anode material suppliers, with patenting interest focused on battery anode applications.

The exfoliation process for bulk graphite, which involves separating the carbon layers within graphite, has been extensively studied between 2012 and 2021. Specifically, ultrasonic and thermal exfoliation have been the two most popular approaches worldwide, with 4,267 and 2,579 patent families, respectively, significantly more than for either the chemical or electrochemical alternatives.

Global patenting activity relating to ultrasonic exfoliation has decreased over the years, indicating that this low-cost technique has become well established. Thermal exfoliation is a more recent process. Compared to ultrasonic exfoliation, this fast and solvent-free thermal approach has attracted greater commercial interest.

As the most widespread anode material for lithium-ion batteries, graphite has drawn significant attention worldwide for use in battery applications. With over 8,000 patent families filed from 2012 to 2021, battery applications were a key driver of global graphite-related inventions. Innovations in this area are led by battery manufacturers or anode suppliers who have amassed sizable patent portfolios focused strongly on battery performance improvements based on graphite anode innovation. Besides industry players, academia and research institutions have been an essential source of innovation in graphite anode technologies.

Graphite for polymer applications was an innovation hot topic from 2012 to 2021, with over 8,000 patent families recorded worldwide. However, in recent years, in the top countries of applicant origin in this area, including China, Japan and the United States of America (US), patent filings have decreased.

Graphite for manufacturing ceramics represents another area of intensive research, with over 6,000 patent families registered in the last decade alone. Specifically, graphite for refractory accounted for over one-third of ceramics-related graphite patent families in China and about one-fifth in the rest of the world. Other important graphite applications include high-value ceramic materials such as carbides for specific industries, ranging from electrical and electronics, aerospace and precision engineering to military and nuclear applications.

Carbon brushes represent a long-explored graphite application area. There have been few inventions in this area over the last decade, with less than 300 patent families filed from 2012 to 2021, very significantly less than between 1992 and 2011.

Biomedical, sensor, and conductive ink are emerging application areas for graphite that have attracted interest from both academia and commercial entities, including renowned universities and multinational corporations. Typically for an emerging technology area, related patent families were filed by various organizations without any players dominating. As a result, the top applicants have a small number of inventions, unlike in well-explored areas, where they will have strong technology accumulation and large patent portfolios. The innovation focus of these three emerging areas is highly scattered and can be diverse, even for a single applicant. However, recent inventions are seen to leverage the development of graphite nanomaterials, particularly graphite nanocomposites and graphene.

<text>Garretson Beekman Trudeau (born July 21, 1948) is an American cartoonist best known for creating the &quot;Doonesbury&quot; comic strip.

Trudeau won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning in 1975, making him the first comic strip artist to win a Pulitzer. He is one of only two comic strip artists to win the award, the other being Berkeley Breathed, whose work was influenced by Trudeau. Trudeau was also the creator and executive producer of the Amazon Studios political comedy series &quot;Alpha House&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Trudeau was born in New York City, the son of Jean Douglas ( Moore, daughter of New York Assembly member Thomas Channing Moore) and Francis Berger Trudeau Jr. He is the great-grandson of Edward Livingston Trudeau, who created Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis at Saranac Lake, New York. Edward was succeeded by his son Francis and grandson Francis Jr. The latter founded the Trudeau Institute at Saranac Lake, with which Garry Trudeau retains a connection.

Raised in Saranac Lake, Trudeau attended St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire. He enrolled in Yale University in 1966. As an art major, Trudeau initially focused on painting, but soon discovered a greater interest in the graphic arts. He spent much of his time cartooning and writing for Yale&#x27;s humor magazine &quot;The Yale Record&quot;, eventually serving as the magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief. At the same time, Trudeau began contributing to the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;, which eventually led to the creation of &quot;Bull Tales&quot;, a comic strip parodying the exploits of Yale quarterback Brian Dowling. This strip was the progenitor of &quot;Doonesbury&quot;.

While still an undergraduate at Yale, Trudeau published two collections of &quot;Bull Tales&quot;: &quot;Bull Tales&quot; (1969, published by the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;) and &quot;Michael J.&quot; (1970, published by &quot;The Yale Record&quot;).

As a senior, Trudeau became a member of Scroll and Key. He did postgraduate work at the Yale School of Art, earning a Master of Fine Arts degree in graphic design in 1973. It was there that Trudeau first met photographer David Levinthal, with whom he collaborated on &quot;Hitler Moves East&quot;, an influential &quot;graphic chronicle&quot; of the German invasion of the Soviet Union.

== Creative works ==
Soon after &quot;Bull Tales&quot; began running in the Yale student newspaper, the strip caught the attention of the newly formed Universal Press Syndicate. The syndicate&#x27;s editor, James F. Andrews, recruited Trudeau, changed the strip&#x27;s name to &quot;Doonesbury&quot;, and began distributing it following the cartoonist&#x27;s graduation in 1970. Today &quot;Doonesbury&quot; is syndicated to 1,000 daily and Sunday newspapers worldwide and is accessible online in association with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

In 1975, Trudeau became the first comic strip artist to win a Pulitzer, traditionally awarded to editorial-page cartoonists. He was also a Pulitzer finalist in 1990, 2004, and 2005. Other awards during this time include the National Cartoonist Society Newspaper Comic Strip Award in 1994, the Reuben Award from the National Cartoonist Society in 1995, the George Orwell Award in 1994, and the Forte dei Marmi Prize for Satire 1990 in Italy,

Awards received in the 21st century include: The Max &amp; Moritz Award for Best Comic Strip (2006, Germany) the Harvey Award, Best Syndicated Strip (2011), 
the George Polk Award, Lifetime Achievement (2015), and the National Cartoonist Society&#x27;s Gold T-Square (2021).

Trudeau&#x27;s work has been recognized by fellowships and halls of fame. In 1993, Trudeau was made a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
In 2021, he was inducted into the New York State Writers Hall of Fame, and the Eisner Hall of Fame in 2023.

Wiley Miller, fellow comic-strip artist responsible for &quot;Non Sequitur&quot;, called him &quot;far and away the most influential editorial cartoonist in the last 25 years&quot;. A regular graduation speaker, Trudeau has received 37 honorary degrees.

In addition to his creating his strip, Trudeau has worked in both theater and television. He was nominated for an Oscar in 1977 in the category of Animated Short Film for &quot;A Doonesbury Special&quot;, created for NBC in collaboration with John and Faith Hubley. The film won the Cannes Film Festival Jury Prize in 1978. In 1984, with composer Elizabeth Swados, he wrote the book and lyrics for the Broadway musical &quot;Doonesbury&quot;, for which he was nominated for two Drama Desk Awards. A cast album of the show, recorded for MCA, received a Grammy nomination. Trudeau again collaborated with Swados in 1984, this time on &quot;Rap Master Ronnie&quot;, a satirical revue about the Reagan Administration that opened off-Broadway at the Village Gate. A filmed version, featuring Jon Cryer, the Smothers Brothers, and Carol Kane, was broadcast on Cinemax in 1988.

Also in 1988, Trudeau wrote and co-produced with director Robert Altman HBO&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Tanner &#x27;88&quot;, a satiric look at that year&#x27;s presidential election campaign. The show won the gold medal for Best Television Series at the Cannes Television Festival, the British Academy Television Award for Best Foreign Program, and Best Imported Program from the British Broadcasting Press Guild. It earned an Emmy Award, as well as four ACE Award nominations. In 2004, Trudeau reunited with Altman to write and co-produce a sequel mini-series, &quot;Tanner on Tanner&quot;, for the Sundance Channel.

In 1996, &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; speculated that Trudeau had written the novel &quot;Primary Colors&quot;, which was later revealed to have been written by Joe Klein. In February 2000, Trudeau, working with Dotcomix, launched &quot;Duke2000&quot;, a web-based presidential campaign featuring a real-time, 3-D, streaming-animation version of Duke. Nearly 30 campaign videos were created for the site, and Ambassador Duke was interviewed live by satellite on the &quot;Today Show, Larry King Live, The Charlie Rose Show&quot;, and dozens of local TV and radio news shows.

In 2013, Trudeau created, wrote and co-produced &quot;Alpha House&quot;, a political sitcom starring John Goodman that revolves around four Republican U.S. Senators who live together in a townhouse on Capitol Hill. Trudeau was inspired to write the show&#x27;s pilot after reading a 2007 &quot;New York Times&quot; article about a real D.C. townhouse shared by New York Senator Chuck Schumer, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, and California Representative George Miller, all Democrats. The pilot for &quot;Alpha House&quot; was produced by Amazon Studios and aired in early 2013. Due to positive response, Amazon picked up the show to develop into a full series, streaming eleven episodes for its first season. On March 31, 2014, Amazon announced that &quot;Alpha House&quot; had been renewed. Production began in July 2014, and the entire second season became available for streaming on October 24, 2014.

While writing &quot;Alpha House&quot;, Trudeau put the daily Doonesbury into rerun mode. On March 3, 2014, the &quot;Classic Doonesbury&quot; series began, featuring approximately four weeks of daily strips from each year of the strip&#x27;s run. He continues to produce new strips for Sundays. Although &quot;Alpha House&quot; has not been in production since the end of 2014, Trudeau has not returned to creating daily &quot;Doonesbury&quot; strips; new material remains a Sunday-only event.

Trudeau has contributed to such publications as &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;New York&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. From 1990 to 1994, he wrote and drew an occasional column for &quot;The New York Times&quot; op-ed page, and was a contributing essayist for &quot;Time&quot; magazine from 1996 to 2001.

Beginning with the Gulf War in 1991, Trudeau has written about military issues extensively. In recognition for his work on injured soldiers, he has been presented with the Commander&#x27;s Award for Public Service by the Department of the Army, the Commander&#x27;s Award from Disabled American Veterans, the President&#x27;s Award for Excellence in the Arts from Vietnam Veterans of America, the Distinguished Public Service Award from the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, the Mental Health Research Advocacy Award from the Yale School of Medicine, and a special citation from the Vet Centers.

He received several unit commendations from the field during the Gulf War, and he traveled with the USO to visit troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. From 2005 to 2014, his website hosted &quot;The Sandbox&quot;, a milblog posting over 800 essays by deployed soldiers, returned vets, caregivers, and spouses. For most of the strip&#x27;s run, Trudeau has eschewed merchandising, but starting in 1998 he teamed up with Starbucks to create &quot;Doonesbury&quot; products to raise funds for local literacy programs. The items were offered for sale in Starbucks stores for nearly two years and raised over $1 million. Also for charity, Trudeau licensed the strip to Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s, which created a bestselling sorbet flavor called &quot;Doonesberry&quot;.

Trudeau&#x27;s son Ross, a digital media producer, is also a crossword constructor who has been published in the &quot;New York Times.&quot; As part of the ongoing celebrity partnership series, father and son collaborated on a crossword puzzle that was published on May 15, 2018, in the &quot;Times&quot;.

Trudeau, formerly a member of Writers Guild of America, East, left and maintained financial core status.

== Private life and public appearances ==
Trudeau married Jane Pauley on June 14, 1980; they have three children.
He maintains a low personal profile. A rare early appearance on television was as a guest on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; in 1971, where only one of the three panelists guessed his identity. In 1990, Trudeau appeared on the cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot; for &quot;Inside Doonesbury&#x27;s Brain&quot;, a story written by Jonathan Alter. This was the first interview Trudeau had given in 17 years.

Trudeau cooperated extensively with &quot;Wired&quot; magazine for a 2000 profile, &quot;The Revolution Will be Satirized&quot;. He later spoke with the writer of that article, Edward Cone, for a 2004 newspaper column in the Greensboro, North Carolina, &quot;News &amp; Record&quot;, about the war wounds suffered by the Doonesbury character &quot;B.D.&quot;, and in 2006 did a Q&amp;A at Cone&#x27;s personal blog about The Sandbox. Trudeau granted an interview to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2004 in which he discussed his time at Yale, which he attended two years behind George W. Bush. He granted another &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview in 2010. In 2006, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; printed an extensive profile of Trudeau by writer Gene Weingarten. He appeared on the &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; television program, and at signings for &quot;The Long Road Home: One Step at a Time&quot;, his &quot;Doonesbury&quot; book about B.D.&#x27;s struggle with injuries received during the second Gulf War.

On August 1, 2016, Trudeau appeared on MSNBC on &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot;. He was brought on to discuss his prediction about Donald Trump&#x27;s plans to run for president almost three decades earlier. Maddow presented cartoon strips from as far back as 1987. Trudeau was on her show to promote his new book &quot;Yuge&quot;, which covers 30 years of Trump appearing in &quot;Doonesbury&quot;. On November 7, 2016, Trudeau appeared on &quot;Fresh Air&quot; with Terry Gross to discuss &quot;Yuge&quot;. On the &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; broadcast of December 2, 2018, he was featured and was interviewed by his wife, Jane Pauley.

== Appraisals and controversies ==

Eric Alterman, writing in &quot;The Nation&quot;, called &quot;Doonesbury&quot; &quot;one of the great intellectual/artistic accomplishments of the past half-century, irrespective of category&quot;.

Trudeau has also attracted criticism both for the comic strip and for his own opinions. In 1985, responding to changes after his 1983–1984 hiatus in &quot;Doonesbury&quot;, readers of &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; voted Trudeau one of the &quot;Most Overrated People in American Arts and Letters&quot;, stating that after his hiatus, his comic strip was &quot;predictable, mean-spirited, and not as funny as before.&quot;
 Trudeau&#x27;s acceptance speech on the occasion of receiving a Polk Award in 2015 for lifetime achievement stirred controversy. In the speech, Trudeau criticized the cartoonists of &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot;—after a number of &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; writers, editors and cartoonists had been murdered execution-style in their own Paris offices by Muslim terrorists—for &quot;punching downward... attacking a powerless, disenfranchised minority with crude, vulgar drawings closer to graffiti than cartoons&quot;, and thereby wandering &quot;into the realm of hate speech&quot; with cartoons of Muhammad. Writing in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, in which Trudeau had published his speech, political commentator David Frum criticized what he called Trudeau&#x27;s &quot;moral theory&quot; that calls for identifying &quot;the bearer of privilege&quot;, then holding &quot;the privilege-bearer responsible&quot;. Trudeau was labeled a &quot;terror apologist&quot; by the editors of &quot;New York Post&quot; for his comments, with his choice of the venue in which to make them &quot;adding to the insult&quot;.

<text>A guild ( ) is an association of artisans and merchants who oversee the practice of their craft/trade in a particular territory. The earliest types of guild formed as organizations of tradespeople belonging to a professional association. They sometimes depended on grants of letters patent from a monarch or other ruler to enforce the flow of trade to their self-employed members, and to retain ownership of tools and the supply of materials, but most were regulated by the local government. Guild members found guilty of cheating the public would be fined or banned from the guild. A lasting legacy of traditional guilds are the guildhalls constructed and used as guild meeting-places.

Typically the key &quot;privilege&quot; was that only guild members were allowed to sell their goods or practice their skill within the city. There might be controls on minimum or maximum prices, hours of trading, numbers of apprentices, and many other things. Critics argued that these rules reduced free competition, but defenders maintained that they protected professional standards.

An important result of the guild framework was the emergence of universities at Bologna (established in 1088), Oxford (at least since 1096) and Paris (); they originated as guilds of students (as at Bologna) or of masters (as at Paris).

== Early history ==
Naram-Sin of Akkad (–2218 BC), grandson of Sargon of Akkad who had unified Sumeria and Assyria into the Akkadian Empire, promulgated common Mesopotamian standards for length, area, volume, weight, time, and shekels, which were used by artisan guilds in each city. Code of Hammurabi Law 234 () stipulated a 2-shekel wage for each 60-gur (300-bushel) vessel constructed in an employment contract between a shipbuilder and a ship-owner. Law 275 stipulated a ferry rate of 3-gerah per day on a charterparty between a ship charterer and a shipmaster. Law 276 stipulated a 2-gerah per day freight rate on a contract of affreightment between a charterer and shipmaster, while Law 277 stipulated a -shekel per day freight rate for a 60-gur vessel.

A type of guild was known in Roman times. Known as &quot;collegium&quot;, &quot;collegia&quot; or &quot;corpus&quot;, these were organised groups of merchants who specialised in a particular craft and whose membership of the group was voluntary. One such example is the &quot;corpus naviculariorum&quot;, a collegium of merchant mariners based at Rome&#x27;s La Ostia port. The Roman guilds failed to survive the collapse of the Roman Empire.

A &quot;collegium&quot; was any association or corporation that acted as a legal entity. In 1816, an archeological excavation in Minya, Egypt produced a Nerva–Antonine dynasty-era (second-century AD) clay tablet from the ruins of the Temple of Antinous in Antinoöpolis, Aegyptus that prescribed the rules and membership dues of a burial society &quot;collegium&quot; established in Lanuvium, Italia in approximately 133 AD. Following the passage of the &quot;Lex Julia&quot; in 45 BC, and its reaffirmation during the reign of Caesar Augustus (27 BC–14 AD), &quot;collegia&quot; required the approval of the Roman Senate or the emperor in order to be authorized as legal bodies. Ruins at Lambaesis date the formation of burial societies among Roman soldiers and mariners to the reign of Septimius Severus (193–211) in 198 AD. In September 2011, archeological investigations done at the site of an artificial harbor in Rome, the Portus, revealed inscriptions in a shipyard constructed during the reign of Trajan (98–117) indicating the existence of a shipbuilders guild. &quot;Collegia&quot; also included fraternities of priests overseeing sacrifices, practicing augury, keeping religious texts, arranging festivals, and maintaining specific religious cults.

== Middle ages and early modern period ==

There were several types of guilds, including the two main categories of merchant guilds and craft guilds but also the frith guild and religious guild. Guilds arose beginning in the High Middle Ages as craftsmen united to protect their common interests. In the German city of Augsburg craft guilds are mentioned in the Towncharter of 1156.

The continental system of guilds and merchants arrived in England after the Norman Conquest, with incorporated societies of merchants in each town or city holding exclusive rights of doing business there. In many cases they became the governing body of a town. For example, London&#x27;s Guildhall became the seat of the Court of Common Council of the City of London Corporation, the world&#x27;s oldest continuously elected local government, whose members to this day must be Freemen of the city. The Freedom of the City, effective from the Middle Ages until 1835, gave the right to trade, and was only bestowed upon members of a Guild or Livery.
Early egalitarian communities called &quot;guilds&quot; were denounced by Catholic clergy for their &quot;conjurations&quot; — the binding oaths sworn among the members to support one another in adversity, kill specific enemies, and back one another in feuds or in business ventures. The occasion for these oaths were drunken banquets held on December 26. In 858, West Francian Bishop Hincmar sought vainly to Christianise the guilds.

In the Early Middle Ages, most of the Roman craft organisations, originally formed as religious confraternities, had disappeared, with the apparent exceptions of stonecutters and perhaps glassmakers, mostly the people that had local skills. Gregory of Tours tells a miraculous tale of a builder whose art and techniques suddenly left him, but were restored by an apparition of the Virgin Mary in a dream. Michel Rouche remarks that the story speaks for the importance of practically transmitted journeymanship.

In France, guilds were called &quot;corps de métiers&quot;. According to Viktor Ivanovich Rutenburg, &quot;Within the guild itself there was very little division of labour, which tended to operate rather between the guilds. Thus, according to Étienne Boileau&#x27;s Book of Handicrafts, by the mid-13th century there were no less than 100 guilds in Paris, a figure which by the 14th century had risen to 350.&quot; There were different guilds of metal-workers: the farriers, knife-makers, locksmiths, chain-forgers, nail-makers, often formed separate and distinct corporations; the armourers were divided into helmet-makers, escutcheon-makers, harness-makers, harness-polishers, etc. In Catalan towns, especially at Barcelona, guilds or &quot;gremis&quot; were a basic agent in the society: a shoemakers&#x27; guild is recorded in 1208.

In England, specifically in the City of London Corporation, more than 110 guilds, referred to as livery companies, survive today, with the oldest years old. Other groups, such as the Worshipful Company of Tax Advisers, have been formed far more recently. Membership in a livery company is expected for individuals participating in the governance of &quot;The City&quot;, as the Lord Mayor and the Remembrancer.
The guild system reached a mature state in Germany and held on in German cities into the 19th century, with some special privileges for certain occupations remaining today. In the 15th century, Hamburg had 100 guilds, Cologne 80, and Lübeck 70. The latest guilds to develop in Western Europe were the &quot;&quot; of Spain: e.g., Valencia (1332) or Toledo (1426).

Not all city economies were controlled by guilds; some cities were &quot;free.&quot; Where guilds were in control, they shaped labor, production and trade; they had strong controls over instructional capital, and the modern concepts of a lifetime progression of apprentice to craftsman, and then from journeyman eventually to widely recognized master and grandmaster began to emerge. In order to become a master, a journeyman would have to go on a three-year voyage called journeyman years. The practice of the journeyman years still exists in Germany and France.

As production became more specialized, trade guilds were divided and subdivided, eliciting the squabbles over jurisdiction that produced the paperwork by which economic historians trace their development: The metalworking guilds of Nuremberg were divided among dozens of independent trades in the boom economy of the 13th century, and there were 101 trades in Paris by 1260. In Ghent, as in Florence, the woolen textile industry developed as a congeries of specialized guilds. The appearance of the European guilds was tied to the emergent money economy, and to urbanization. Before this time it was not possible to run a money-driven organization, as commodity money was the normal way of doing business.

The guild was at the center of European handicraft organization into the 16th century. In France, a resurgence of the guilds in the second half of the 17th century is symptomatic of Louis XIV and Jean Baptiste Colbert&#x27;s administration&#x27;s concerns to impose unity, control production, and reap the benefits of transparent structure in the shape of efficient taxation.
The guilds were identified with organizations enjoying certain privileges (letters patent), usually issued by the king or state and overseen by local town business authorities (some kind of chamber of commerce). These were the predecessors of the modern patent and trademark system. The guilds also maintained funds in order to support infirm or elderly members, as well as widows and orphans of guild members, funeral benefits, and a &#x27;tramping&#x27; allowance for those needing to travel to find work. As the guild system of the City of London declined during the 17th century, the Livery Companies transformed into mutual assistance fraternities along such lines.

European guilds imposed long standardized periods of apprenticeship, and made it difficult for those lacking the capital to set up for themselves or without the approval of their peers to gain access to materials or knowledge, or to sell into certain markets, an area that equally dominated the guilds&#x27; concerns. These are defining characteristics of mercantilism in economics, which dominated most European thinking about political economy until the rise of classical economics.

The guild system survived the emergence of early capitalists, which began to divide guild members into &quot;haves&quot; and dependent &quot;have-nots&quot;. The civil struggles that characterize the 14th-century towns and cities were struggles in part between the greater guilds and the lesser artisanal guilds, which depended on piecework. &quot;In Florence, they were openly distinguished: the &quot;Arti maggiori&quot; and the &quot;Arti minori&quot;—already there was a &quot;popolo grasso&quot; and a &quot;popolo magro&quot;&quot;. Fiercer struggles were those between essentially conservative guilds and the merchant class, which increasingly came to control the means of production and the capital that could be ventured in expansive schemes, often under the rules of guilds of their own. German social historians trace the &quot;Zunftrevolution&quot;, the urban revolution of guildmembers against a controlling urban patriciate, sometimes reading into them, however, perceived foretastes of the class struggles of the 19th century.
In the countryside, where guild rules did not operate, there was freedom for the entrepreneur with capital to organize cottage industry, a network of cottagers who spun and wove in their own premises on his account, provided with their raw materials, perhaps even their looms, by the capitalist who took a share of the profits. Such a dispersed system could not so easily be controlled where there was a vigorous local market for the raw materials: wool was easily available in sheep-rearing regions, whereas silk was not.

=== Organization ===
In Florence, Italy, there were seven to twelve &quot;greater guilds&quot; and fourteen &quot;lesser guilds&quot;. The most important of the greater guilds was that for judges and notaries, who handled the legal business of all the other guilds and often served as an arbitrator of disputes. Other greater guilds include the wool, silk, and the money changers&#x27; guilds. They prided themselves on a reputation for very high-quality work, which was rewarded with premium prices. The guilds fined members who deviated from standards. Other greater guilds included those of doctors, druggists, and furriers. Among the lesser guilds, were those for bakers, saddle makers, ironworkers and other artisans. They had a sizable membership, but lacked the political and social standing necessary to influence city affairs.
The guild was made up by experienced and confirmed experts in their field of handicraft. They were called master craftsmen. Before a new employee could rise to the level of mastery, he had to go through a schooling period during which he was first called an apprenticeship. After this period he could rise to the level of journeyman. Apprentices would typically not learn more than the most basic techniques until they were trusted by their peers to keep the guild&#x27;s or company&#x27;s secrets.

Like &quot;journey&quot;, the distance that could be travelled in a day, the title &#x27;journeyman&#x27; derives from the French words for &#x27;day&#x27; (&quot;jour&quot; and &quot;journée&quot;) from which came the middle English word &quot;journei&quot;. Journeymen were able to work for other masters, unlike apprentices, and generally paid by the day and were thus day labourers. After being employed by a master for several years, and after producing a qualifying piece of work, the apprentice was granted the rank of journeyman and was given documents (letters or certificates from his master and/or the guild itself) which certified him as a journeyman and entitled him to travel to other towns and countries to learn the art from other masters. These journeys could span large parts of Europe and were an unofficial way of communicating new methods and techniques, though by no means all journeymen made such travels — they were most common in Germany and Italy, and in other countries journeymen from small cities would often visit the capital.
After this journey and several years of experience, a journeyman could be received as master craftsman, though in some guilds this step could be made straight from apprentice. This would typically require the approval of all masters of a guild, a donation of money and other goods (often omitted for sons of existing members), and the production of a so-called &quot;masterpiece&quot;, which would illustrate the abilities of the aspiring master craftsman; this was often retained by the guild.

The medieval guild was established by charters or letters patent or similar authority by the city or the ruler and normally held a monopoly on trade in its craft within the city in which it operated: handicraft workers were forbidden by law to run any business if they were not members of a guild, and only masters were allowed to be members of a guild. Before these privileges were legislated, these groups of handicraft workers were simply called &#x27;handicraft associations&#x27;.

The town authorities might be represented in the guild meetings and thus had a means of controlling the handicraft activities. This was important since towns very often depended on a good reputation for export of a narrow range of products, on which not only the guild&#x27;s, but the town&#x27;s, reputation depended. Controls on the association of physical locations to well-known exported products, e.g. wine from the Champagne and Bordeaux regions of France, tin-glazed earthenwares from certain cities in Holland, lace from Chantilly, etc., helped to establish a town&#x27;s place in global commerce — this led to modern trademarks.

In many German and Italian cities, the more powerful guilds often had considerable political influence, and sometimes attempted to control the city authorities. In the 14th century, this led to numerous bloody uprisings, during which the guilds dissolved town councils and detained patricians in an attempt to increase their influence. In fourteenth-century north-east Germany, people of Wendish, i.e. Slavic, origin were not allowed to join some guilds. According to Wilhelm Raabe, &quot;down into the eighteenth century no German guild accepted a Wend.&quot;

==== Guilds of merchants in the Russian Empire ====
In the Russian Empire, from the reform of Peter the Great (beginning of the 17th century) until 1917, these were corporations of wealthy merchants, with their own rights. They therefore constituted an Order which was divided, according to property, into three classes: merchant of the first Guild, of the second Guild, and of the third Guild and was transmissible hereditarily.

=== Fall of the guilds ===
Ogilvie (2004) argues that guilds negatively affected quality, skills, and innovation. Through what economists now call &quot;rent-seeking&quot; they imposed deadweight losses on the economy. Ogilvie argues they generated limited positive externalities and notes that industry began to flourish only after the guilds faded away. Guilds persisted over the centuries because they redistributed resources to politically powerful merchants. On the other hand, Ogilvie agrees, guilds created &quot;social capital&quot; of shared norms, common information, mutual sanctions, and collective political action. This social capital benefited guild members, even as it arguably hurt outsiders.
The guild system became a target of much criticism towards the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. Critics argued that they hindered free trade and technological innovation, technology transfer and business development. According to several accounts of this time, guilds became increasingly involved in simple territorial struggles against each other and against free practitioners of their arts.

Two of the most outspoken critics of the guild system were Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith, and all over Europe a tendency to oppose government control over trades in favour of laissez-faire free market systems grew rapidly and made its way into the political and legal systems. Many people who participated in the French Revolution saw guilds as a last remnant of feudalism. The d&#x27;Allarde Law of 2 March 1791 suppressed the guilds in France. In 1803 the Napoleonic Code banned any coalition of workmen whatsoever. Smith wrote in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (Book I, Chapter X, paragraph 72):

Karl Marx in his &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; also criticized the guild system for its rigid gradation of social rank and what he saw as the relation of oppressor and oppressed entailed by this system. It was the 18th and 19th centuries that saw the beginning of the low regard in which some people hold the guilds to this day. In part due to their own inability to control unruly corporate behavior, the tide of public opinion turned against the guilds.

Because of industrialization and modernization of the trade and industry, and the rise of powerful nation-states that could directly issue patent and copyright protections — often revealing the trade secrets — the guilds&#x27; power faded. After the French Revolution they gradually fell in most European nations over the course of the 19th century, as the guild system was disbanded and replaced by laws that promoted free trade. As a consequence of the decline of guilds, many former handicraft workers were forced to seek employment in the emerging manufacturing industries, using not closely guarded techniques formerly protected by guilds, but rather the standardized methods controlled by corporations.
Interest in the medieval guild system was revived during the late 19th century, among far-right circles. Fascism in Italy (among other countries) implemented corporatism, operating at the national rather than city level, to try to imitate the corporatism of the Middle Ages.

=== Influence ===

Guilds are sometimes said to be the precursors of modern cartels. Guilds, however, can also be seen as a set of self-employed skilled craftsmen with ownership and control over the materials and tools they needed to produce their goods. Some argue that guilds operated more like cartels than they were like trade unions (Olson 1982). However, the journeymen organizations, which were at the time illegal, may have been influential.

The exclusive privilege of a guild to produce certain goods or provide certain services was similar in spirit and character to the original patent systems that surfaced in England in 1624. These systems played a role in ending the guilds&#x27; dominance, as trade secret methods were superseded by modern firms directly revealing their techniques, and counting on the state to enforce their legal monopoly.

Some guild traditions still remain in a few handicrafts, in Europe especially among shoemakers and barbers. These are, however, not very important economically except as reminders of the responsibilities of some trades toward the public.

Modern antitrust law could be said to derive in some ways from the original statutes by which the guilds were abolished in Europe.

=== Economic consequences ===
The economic consequences of guilds have led to heated debates among economic historians. On the one side, scholars say that since merchant guilds persisted over long periods they must have been efficient institutions (since inefficient institutions die out). Others say they persisted not because they benefited the entire economy but because they benefited the owners, who used political power to protect them. Ogilvie (2011) says they regulated trade for their own benefit, were monopolies, distorted markets, fixed prices, and restricted entrance into the guild. Ogilvie (2008) argues that their long apprenticeships were unnecessary to acquire skills, and their conservatism reduced the rate of innovation and made the society poorer. She says their main goal was rent seeking, that is, to shift money to the membership at the expense of the entire economy.

Epstein and Prak&#x27;s book (2008) rejects Ogilvie&#x27;s conclusions. Specifically, Epstein argues that guilds were cost-sharing rather than rent-seeking institutions. They located and matched masters and likely apprentices through monitored learning. Whereas the acquisition of craft skills required experience-based learning, he argues that this process necessitated many years in apprenticeship.

The extent to which guilds were able to monopolize markets is also debated.

====Product quality====
Guilds were often heavily concerned with product quality. The regulations they established on their own members&#x27; work, as well as targeting non-guild members for illicit practice, was to create a standard of work that the consumer could rely on. They were heavily concerned with public perception. In October 1712, the Lyon Wigmaker Guild petitioned the local police magistrates. According to this petition, guildmasters required guild officers to step up policing of statutes forbidding the use of bleached hair or wild goat and lamb hair. The real concern that they had was that bleaching hair destroyed the quality of the wig, making it too thin to style. Guild officers pointed out that if the consumer discovers the bad quality, the guild would be blamed, and the consumer would search elsewhere to purchase goods.

== Women in guilds ==

=== Medieval period ===
Women&#x27;s participation within medieval guilds was complex and varied. On one hand, guild membership allowed women to participate in the economy that provided social privilege and community. On the other hand, most trade and craft guilds were male-dominated and frequently limited women&#x27;s rights if they were members, or did not allow membership at all. The most common way women obtained guild membership was through marriage. Usually only the widows and daughters of known masters were allowed in. Even if a woman entered a guild, she was excluded from guild offices. While this was the overarching practice, there were guilds and professions that did allow women&#x27;s participation, and the medieval era was an ever-changing, mutable society—especially considering that it spanned hundreds of years and many different cultures. There were multiple accounts of women&#x27;s participation in guilds in England and the Continent. In a study of London silkwomen of the 15th century by Marian K. Dale, she notes that medieval women could inherit property, belong to guilds, manage estates, and run the family business if widowed. The &quot;Livre des métiers de Paris (Book of Trades of Paris)&quot; was compiled by Étienne Boileau, the Grand Provost of Paris under King Louis IX. It documents that 5 out of 110 Parisian guilds were female monopolies, and that only a few guilds systematically excluded women. Boileau notes that some professions were also open to women: surgeons, glass-blowers, chain-mail forgers. Entertainment guilds also had a significant number of women members. John, Duke of Berry documents payments to female musicians from Le Puy, Lyons, and Paris. In Rouen women had participated as full-fledged masters in 7 of the city&#x27;s 112 guilds since the 13th century. There were still many restrictions. Medieval Parisian guilds did not offer women independent control of their work.

Women did have problems with entering healers&#x27; guilds, as opposed to their relative freedom in trade or craft guilds. Their status in healers&#x27; guilds were often challenged. The idea that medicine should only be practiced by men was supported by some religious and secular authorities at the time. It is believed that the Inquisition and witch hunts throughout the ages contributed to the lack of women in medical guilds.

In medieval Cologne there were three guilds that were composed almost entirely of women, the yarn-spinners, gold-spinners, and silk-weavers. Men could join these guilds, but were almost exclusively married to guildswomen. This was a required regulation of the yarn-spinners guild. The guildswomen of the gold-spinners guild were often wives of guildsmen of the gold-smiths. This type of unity between husband and wife was seen in women&#x27;s guild participation through the medieval and early modern periods; in order to avoid unpleasant litigation or legal situations, the trades of husband and wife often were the same or complementary. Women were not restricted to solely textile guilds in medieval Cologne, and neither did they have total freedom in all textile guilds. They had limited participation in the guilds of dyers, cotton-weavers, and guilds in the leather industry. They did enjoy full rights in some wood-working guilds, the guilds of coopers and turners. Women also seemed to have extensively engaged in the fish trade, both within and outside of the guild. The butcher and cattle-trade guilds also listed women among their ranks. In practically all of these guilds, a widow was allowed to continue her husband&#x27;s business. If she remarried to a man who was not a member, she usually lost that right.

The historian Alice Clark published a study in 1919 on women&#x27;s participation in guilds during the medieval period. She argued that the guild system empowered women to participate in family businesses. This viewpoint, among others of Clark&#x27;s, has been criticized by fellow historians, and has sparked debate in scholarly circles. Clark&#x27;s analysis of the period is that things change during the early modern period, specifically the 17th century, and become more stifling for women in guilds. She also posits that domestic life drove women out of guild participation.

=== Early modern period ===

==== Decline thesis ====
Many historians have done research into the dwindling women&#x27;s participation in guilds. Studies have provided a contradictory picture. Recent historical research is usually posed in rebuttal to Alice Clark&#x27;s study on the economic marginalization of women in the 17th c., and has highlighted that domestic life did not organize women&#x27;s economic activities. The research has documented women&#x27;s extensive participation in market relations, craft production, and paid labor in the early modern period. Clare Crowston posits that women gained more control of their own work. In the 16th and 17th centuries, rather than losing control, female linen drapers and hemp merchants established independent guilds. In the late 17th century and onward, there was evidence of growing economic opportunities for women. Seamstresses in Paris and Rouen and flower sellers in Paris acquired their own guilds in 1675. In Dijon, the number of female artisans recorded in tax rolls rose substantially between the years of 1643 and 1750. In 18th c. Nantes, there was a significant growth in women&#x27;s access to guilds, with no restrictions on their rights.

Historian Merry Wiesner attributed a decline in women&#x27;s labor in south German cities from the 16th-18th centuries to both economic and cultural factors; as trades became more specialized, women&#x27;s domestic responsibilities hindered them from entering the workforce. German guilds started to further regulate women&#x27;s participation at this time, limiting the privileges of wives, widows, and daughters. It also forbade masters from hiring women. Crowston notes that the decline thesis has been reaffirmed in the German context by Wiesner and Ogilvie, but that it does not work in looking at the matter from a larger scope, as her expertise is in French history.

==== Independent female guilds ====
There were exclusively female guilds that came out of the woodwork in the 17th century, primarily Paris, Rouen, and Cologne. In 1675, Parisian seamstresses requested the guild as their trade was organized and profitable enough to support incorporation. Some of the guilds in Cologne had been made up almost entirely of women since the medieval period.

=== Women&#x27;s guild activity ===
Early modern Rouen was an important center of guildswomen&#x27;s activity. By 1775, there were about 700 female masters, accounting for 10% of all guild masters in the city. A survey that circulated in the late 18th century listed that the Rouen ribbonmakers had 149 masters, mistresses, and widows, indicating its mixed gendered composition. A tax roll of 1775 indicated that their total membership was about 160, with 58 men, 17 widows, 55 wives, and 30 unmarried women.

Historians have noted the essential contributions that women made to these guilds. Many scholars have asserted that it would have been impossible for male merchants and craftsmen to start a business, let alone run it, without the help of their wives.

The oldest women&#x27;s guild in Paris dealt in linens, including household linens, layettes for babies, and undergarments. There seemed to be a major wealth disparity among its members. The linen workers whose sheds were at the center of Les Halles caused the guild some trouble. There was a perception that these workers also trafficked in sex as well as linens, which made the guild emphatic about its own morality. On the other end of the social divide, the linen trade was a respectable occupation for married and single women of high social standing.

In France, special provisions had to be made in order to assure that woman could move relatively freely in the textile guilds of Paris and Rouen. They used a special legal formula, the privilege of the &quot;marchande publique&quot;. This legal device made certain that a woman had the right to participate on her own behalf in the economy, and thus did not require references to her husband&#x27;s resources or possible involvement. If a woman did not join a guild first, she was required to obtain her husband&#x27;s permission in order to receive the status of &quot;marchande publique&quot;. If she did join a guild, the status was conferred automatically. The privilege of &quot;marchande publique&quot; allowed a woman to participate in business as a legal adult, sign contracts, go to court, and borrow money.

In Amsterdam, seamstresses acquired an independent guild in 1579. In several other cities of the Netherlands, they obtained subordinate positions in the tailors&#x27; guilds during the late 17th and 18th centuries.

Frenchwomen provided vocational training to apprentices. In apprenticeship contracts the names and trades of spouses would both appear. The trades were usually the same or closely related. In earlier research, lack of contracts led scholars to believe that women and girls never received official training, and instead learned their trade at home. This was debunked with Clare Crowston&#x27;s research on parish schools in France. Instead of apprenticeships, girls could receive an alternative form of vocational training from these schools. Students entered at around eight for two years of education, and were segregated by gender. Boys studied primarily religion, reading, writing, and mathematics; girls learned many of the same topics as well, but a significant portion was devoted to learning needlework. These schools were intended to enrich the vocational training that girls learned, so that they could go on and earn a living. According to Crowston, the most important religious community that offered such training were the Filles de Saint-Agnès, which offered instruction in four trades: linen work, embroidery, lace, and tapestry-making. The school provided all of the tools necessary for girls to learn, and also allowed students to choose which best suited them. Although this was far different than the model of apprenticeship practiced by guilds, the sisters referred to their students as apprentices.

In July 1706, a group of women, members of the Parisian wigmakers, went to Versailles in order to petition Louis XIV to remove a stifling tax that had been levied on wigs that same year. The tax was removed in mid-July 1706 although historians do not believe that the guildswomen were the sole reason as to why.

==== Division of labor ====
When French seamstresses attained guild privileges in 1675, their corporate privilege extended to clothing for women and children. When they entered guilds, seamstresses in Paris, Rouen, and Aix-en-Provence acquired the right to make articles of clothing for women and children, but not for men or boys over age eight. This division reappeared in every French city where seamstresses entered guilds.

==== Underground business ====
Due to the political, legislative, and social power of many guilds during the medieval and early modern periods, any economic activity that encroached on guild purview was considered criminal activity. The black market was used to get around regulations set by the guild for membership, for the goods they produced, and to circumvent expensive fees and taxes that may be imposed by governments. Illegal work did not pass unnoticed by authorities at the time, and are documented by police reports and guild complaints. Guild officers were able to arrest people who were working in the trade without guild credentials, and could use municipal law enforcement to aid them in the arrest. Guilds often did take people to court for illegal work. In 18th c. Lyon, about half of the defendants were men, and half were women. Daryl Hafter notes that many of the female defendants were practicing trades where they were either completely barred from guild membership, or had austere restrictions within the guild. As joining a guild was expensive, this explains why poorer men would turn to illicit craft. Clandestine artisans were seen as a severe encroachment on guild rights, liberties, and exclusivity. Many guilds feared that this would affect economic stability.

In Paris, the Barber-Wigmaker &amp; Bath Provider Guild struggled against illicit wigmaking and styling. In this case, illicit wigmaking flourished in order to circumvent the expensive wig tax. Women and girls could enter this guild. Illicit wigmakers operated throughout the 18th c., and made continuous contributions to the industry.

Judith Coffin posits that the number of clandestine linen drapers, seamstresses, and tailors, kept pace and probably outstripped the numbers from those guilds. Clandestine workers, male and female, worked in garret shops and rooms under guild jurisdiction. Not all non-guild work was illegal, too. A non-guild artisan could work directly for the crown, or in the &quot;free zones&quot; that were beyond the reach of the guild officers. Clandestine workers in the needle trade were often employed by larger merchant manufacturers. Guild members were also enmeshed in illegal labor, either carrying it out, or hiring those who did illegal work. Nearly everyone was in violation of guild statutes. Masters of the guild would often hire illegal workers to do specific and low-paying parts of the job. In the case of the Wigmakers, it was hair-weaving, the most labor-intensive aspect of the craft. Hair weavers arranged pinches of hair side by side and interlaced them in intricate patterns between six silk threads extended on two wooden rods. Women called &quot;tresseuses&quot; seemed to perform a substantial amount of this work outside masters&#x27; shops.

Despite the guilds&#x27; fear of illegal craft, underground business often helped guilds survive. The creation of materials was often illicit, or outsourced from other locales. Masters hired non-guild workers to do high-intensive tasks and paid less, while at the same time denigrating their work. In many cities, guild masters purchased discounted materials and hired cheap labor to reduce costs. In Lyon, the underground silk economy thrived, and was a significant portion of the economy. It was made up of mostly female artisans whose work paralleled that of the legitimate trade. The female artisans were important to the guild as they were highly skilled in craft procedures that the guild heavily relied upon, and were essential to production. But they also worked for male entrepreneurs outside of the guild and frequently collaborated with each other to set up their own businesses. In an effort to curb this illicit activity, guildmasters wrote bylaws forbidding men and women to work outside of the guild. The buttonmakers guild of Lyon also complained about illicit work and theft from the non-guild female workers whom they hired. They also took it upon themselves to teach girls the buttonmaking trade, which was the real problem, as their instruction imparted the &quot;mystery&quot; of guild secrets to non-guild members which undermined the guild.

In the mid-17th c., Lübeck experienced political conflicts as guilds petitioned the councils to ban clandestine work not only in the city but in rural areas. They were outraged that members of the upperclass in Lübeck would employ rural craftsmen at the expense of the city guild. A lot of their anger spurred from the fact that they were part of the council who had sworn to uphold the guild.

Early modern Lyon continued to have a thriving underground economy into the late 18th century. In 1780, the hatters&#x27; guild complained that women and girls who sheared skins for the industry had established an underground manufacture 25 years earlier, and that it was still sustained. These women were the wives of hatters or girls who were hired day by day, and who were not content to be so dependent on the guild. The women were accused of theft of materials, buying stolen materials for cheap, and selling them for larger amounts. What was most surprising was the response from the government, which had previously always stood with guilds even at the economy&#x27;s expense. A royal edict of 1777 formed a corps of these female workers, giving them legitimacy.

== Modern guilds ==
Professional organizations replicate guild structure and operation. Professions such as architecture, engineering, geology, and land surveying require varying lengths of apprenticeships before one can gain a &quot;professional&quot; certification. These certifications hold great legal weight: most states make them a prerequisite to practising there.

Though most guilds died off by the middle of the nineteenth century, quasi-guilds persist today, primarily in the fields of law, medicine, engineering, and academia. Paralleling or soon after the fall of guilds in Britain and in the United States professional associations began to form. In America a number of interested parties sought to emulate the model of apprenticeship which European guilds of the Middle Ages had honed to achieve their ends of establishing exclusivity in trades as well as the English concept of a gentleman which had come to be associated with higher income and craftsmanship

Licensing and accreditation practices which typically result from the lobbying of professional associations constitute the modern equivalent of a &#x27;guild-privilege&#x27;, albeit in contrast to guilds of the Middle Ages which held a letters patent which explicitly granted them monopolies on the provision of services, today&#x27;s quasi-guild privileges are subtler, more complex, and less &quot;directly&quot; restrictive to consumers in their nature.

Nevertheless, it can be argued quasi-guild privileges are in many cases designed not just to serve some notion of public good, but to facilitate the establishing and maintaining of exclusivity in a field of work.

There are often subtle dichotomies present in attempting to answer the question of whether modern licensing and accreditation practices are intended to serve the public good, however it be defined. For medieval guilds this dichotomy is exemplified by differing explanations of the same phenomena; of limiting work hours among guild members. Sheilagh Ogilvie argues that this was intended to mitigate competition among guild members, while Dorothy Terry argues this was to prevent guild members from working late into the night while tired and when lighting is poor and therefore producing low quality work. In modern times, while licensing practices are usually argued to in some way protect members of the public (e.g. by ensuring quality standards), it usually can also be argued that these practices have been engineered to limit the number of &#x27;outsiders&#x27; who gain entrance to a given field.

As argued by Paul Starr and Ronald Hamowy, both of whose focus is on the development of medicine in America, the tying of medical licensing practices to universities was a process intended to do more than protect the public from &#x27;quackery&#x27;, but was engineered to be unnecessarily prolonged, inefficient, and a costly process so as to deter &#x27;outsiders&#x27; from getting into the field, thereby enhancing the prestige and earning power of medical professionals.

The university system in general continues to serve as a basis upon which modern quasi-guilds operate in the form of professionalism. &#x27;Universitas&#x27; in the Middle Ages meant a society of masters who had the capacity for self-governance, and this term was adopted by students and teachers who came together in the twelfth century to form scholars guilds. Though guilds mostly died off by the middle of the nineteenth century, the scholars guild persisted due to its peripheral nature to an industrialized economy. In the words of Elliot Krause,&quot;The university and scholars&#x27; guilds held onto their power over membership, training, and workplace because early capitalism was not interested in it (there was no product that the capitalist wished to produce)...the cultural prestige of knowledge itself helped keep the scholars&#x27; guild and the university alive while all other guilds failed.&quot;

- Elliot Krause, &quot;The Death of Guilds&quot; (1996)Though in theory anyone can start a college, the &#x27;privilege&#x27; in this case is the linking of federal aid to accreditation. While accreditation of a university is entirely optional, attending an accredited university is a prerequisite to receiving federal aid, and this has a powerful influence on limiting consumer options in the field of education as it provides a mechanism to limit entrepreneurial &#x27;outsiders&#x27; from entering the field of education. George Leef and Roxana Burris study the accreditation system for which they observe is &#x27;highly collegial&#x27; and potentially bias in the fact that accreditation review is performed by members of schools who will in turn be reviewed by many of the same people who they have reviewed. They further question the effectiveness of the methods involved in accreditation,&quot;Although accreditation is usually justified as a means of giving students and parents an assurance of educational quality, it is important to note that the accreditors do not endeavor to assess the quality of individual programs or departments... The accreditation system is not based on an evaluation of the results of an institution, but rather upon an evaluation of its inputs and processes. If the inputs and processes look good, acceptable educational quality is assumed. It is as if an organization decided which automobiles would be allowed to be sold by checking to make sure that each car model had tires, doors, an engine and so forth and had been assembled by workers with proper training—but without actually driving any cars&quot;

- George C. Leef and Roxana D. Burris, &quot;Can College Accreditation Live Up To Its Promise?&quot;Taken in the context of guilds, it can be argued that the purpose of accreditation is to provide a mechanism for members of the scholars guild to protect itself, both by limiting outsiders from entering the field and by enforcing established norms onto one another. Contriving means to limit the number of outsiders who gain an entrance to a field (exclusivity) and to enforce work norms among members were both distinguishing feature of guilds in the Middle Ages.

=== Quasi-guilds in the information economy ===
In 1998, Thomas W. Malone championed a modern variant of the guild structure for independent contractors and remote workers. Insurance including any professional legal liability, intellectual capital protections, an ethical code perhaps enforced by peer pressure and software, and other benefits of a strong association of producers of knowledge, benefit from economies of scale, and may prevent cut-throat competition that leads to inferior services undercutting prices. As with historical guilds, such a structure will resist foreign competition.

The open-source-software movement has from time to time explored a guild-like structure to unite against competition from Microsoft, e.g. Advogato assigns journeyer and master ranks to those committing to work only or mostly on free software.

Patents loosely serve as a form of guild privilege in that they restrict potential newcomers to a field of service. The idea of a patent being applied to intangibles (e.g. intellectual patents) has been called to question by various authors. In &quot;Capital and Ideology&quot; (2000) Thomas Piketty questions the validity of patents being granted to agricultural corporations who claim to have &#x27;invented&#x27; certain GMO seeds. According to Piketty, the falsity of such claims is that the specific breakthrough which allowed for the development of these GMO seeds was in fact only the outcome of generations of &quot;public&quot; investment in education and research.

== International differences ==

=== Europe ===
In many European countries, guilds have experienced a revival as local trade organizations for craftsmen, primarily in traditional skills. They may function as forums for developing competence and are often the local units of a national employer&#x27;s organisation.

In the City of London, the ancient guilds survive as livery companies, all of which play a ceremonial role in the city&#x27;s many customs. The City of London livery companies maintain strong links with their respective trade, craft or profession, some still retain regulatory, inspection or enforcement roles. The senior members of the City of London Livery Companies (known as liverymen) elect the sheriffs and approve the candidates for the office of Lord Mayor of London. Guilds also survive in many other towns and cities the UK including in Preston, Lancashire, as the Preston Guild Merchant where among other celebrations descendants of burgesses are still admitted into membership. With the City of London livery companies, the UK has over 300 extant guilds and growing.

In 1878, the London livery companies established the City and Guilds of London Institute the forerunner of the engineering school (still called City and Guilds College) at Imperial College London. The aim of the City and Guilds of London Institute was the advancement of technical education. &quot;City and Guilds&quot; operates as an examining and accreditation body for vocational, managerial and engineering qualifications from entry-level craft and trade skills up to post-doctoral achievement. A separate organisation, the City and Guilds of London Art School has also close ties with the London livery companies and is involved in the training of master craftworkers in stone and wood carving, as well as fine artists.

In Germany, there are no longer any &quot;Zünfte&quot; (or &quot;Gilden&quot; – the terms used were rather different from town to town), nor any restriction of a craft to a privileged corporation. However, under one other of their old names albeit a less frequent one, &quot;Innungen&quot;, guilds continue to exist as private member clubs with membership limited to practitioners of particular trades or activities. These clubs are corporations under public law, albeit the membership is voluntary; the president normally comes from the ranks of master-craftsmen and is called &quot;Obermeister&quot; (&quot;master-in-chief&quot;). Journeymen elect their own representative bodies, with their president having the traditional title of &quot;Altgesell&quot; (senior journeyman).

There are also &quot;craft chambers&quot; (&quot;Handwerkskammern&quot;), which have less resemblance to ancient guilds in that they are organized for all crafts in a certain region, not just one. In them membership is mandatory, and they serve to establish self-governance of the crafts.

Guilds were abolished in France during the French Revolution. Following a decree of 4 August 1789, they survived until March 1791 when they were finally abolished.

=== India ===
India&#x27;s guilds include the Students Guild, Indian Engineers Guild, and the Safety Guild. Other professional associations include the Indian medical Association, Indian Engineers, Indian Dental Association, United nurses Association, etc.
Most of them use Union, Association or Society as suffix.

=== North America ===
In the United States guilds exist in several fields. Often, they are better characterized as a labor union — for example, The Newspaper Guild is a labor union for journalists and other newspaper workers, with over 30,000 members in North America.

In the film and television industry, guild membership is generally a prerequisite for working on major productions in certain capacities. The Screen Actors Guild, Directors Guild of America, Writers Guild of America, East, Writers Guild of America, West and other profession-specific guilds have the ability to exercise strong control in the cinema of the United States as a result of a rigid system of intellectual-property rights and a history of power-brokers also holding guild membership (e.g., DreamWorks Pictures founder Steven Spielberg was, and is, a DGA member). These guilds maintain their own contracts with production companies to ensure a certain number of their members are hired for roles in each film or television production, and that their members are paid a minimum of guild &quot;scale,&quot; along with other labor protections. These guilds set high standards for membership, and exclude professional actors, writers, etc. who do not abide by the strict rules for competing within the film and television industry in America.

Real-estate brokerage offers an example of a modern American guild system. Signs of guild behavior in real-estate brokerage include: standard pricing (6% of the home price), strong affiliation among all practitioners, self-regulation (see National Association of Realtors), strong cultural identity (the Realtor brand), little price variation with quality differences, and traditional methods in use by all practitioners. In September 2005 the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against the National Association of Realtors, challenging NAR practices that (the DOJ asserted) prevent competition from practitioners who use different methods. The DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission in 2005 advocated against state laws, supported by NAR, that disadvantage new kinds of brokers. &quot;U.S. v. National Assoc. of Realtors&quot;, Civil Action No. 05C-5140 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 7, 2005).

The practice of law in the United States also exemplifies modern guilds at work. Every state maintains its own bar association, supervised by that state&#x27;s highest court. The court decides the criteria for entering and staying in the legal profession. In most states, every attorney must become a member of that state&#x27;s bar association in order to practice law. State laws forbid any person from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law and practicing attorneys are subject to rules of professional conduct that are enforced by the state&#x27;s supreme court.

Medical associations comparable to guilds include the state Medical Boards, the American Medical Association, and the American Dental Association. Medical licensing in most states requires specific training, tests and years of low-paid apprenticeship (internship and residency) under harsh working conditions. Even qualified international or out-of-state doctors may not practice without acceptance by the local medical guild (Medical board). Similarly, nurses and physicians&#x27; practitioners have their own guilds. A doctor cannot work as a physician&#x27;s assistant unless (s)he separately trains, tests and apprentices as one.

=== Australia ===
Australia has several guilds. The most notable of these is The Pharmacy Guild of Australia, created in 1927 as the Federated Pharmaceutical Services Guild of Australia. The Pharmacy Guild serves &quot;6,000 community pharmacies,&quot; while also providing training and standards for the country&#x27;s pharmacists. Australia&#x27;s other guilds include the Australian Directors Guild, representing the country&#x27;s directors, documentary makers and animators, the Australian Writers&#x27; Guild, the Australian Butcher&#x27;s Guild, a fraternity of independent butchers which provides links to resources like Australian meat standards and a guide to different beef cuts, and The Artists Guild, a craft guild focusing on female artists.

<doc id="12372" wikidata="Q1324646" url="?curid=12372" title="Gradius (video game)">
<text>is a side-scrolling shooter video game developed and published by Konami. The first game in the &quot;Gradius&quot; series, it was originally released as a coin-operated arcade game in 1985. The player maneuvers a spacecraft known as the Vic Viper that must defend itself from the various alien enemies. The game uses a power-up system called the &quot;power meter&quot;, based upon collecting capsules to purchase additional weapons.

The arcade version of &quot;Gradius&quot; was initially released internationally outside Japan under the title of Nemesis, but subsequent home releases have since used the original title. During development, it had the working title Scramble 2, as it was originally intended to be a follow-up to Konami&#x27;s earlier shooter &quot;Scramble&quot; (1981). Home versions were released for various platforms, such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, the MSX home computer, and the PC Engine. It was a major success in 1986, becoming the year&#x27;s highest-grossing arcade game in London and one of Japan&#x27;s top five table arcade games, while the Famicom port sold over a million copies in Japan that year. Nintendo released the NES version in arcades for the Nintendo VS. System and PlayChoice-10 in November 1986.

&quot;Gradius&quot; was critically acclaimed for its gameplay and unique power-up system. Along with Namco&#x27;s &quot;Xevious&quot;, it is cited as being one of the most important shooter games, having paved the way for many similar games to follow.

==Gameplay==
The player controls the trans-dimensional spaceship Vic Viper and must battle waves of enemies through various environments. The game became synonymous with the phrase, &quot;Destroy the core!&quot;, as the standard of boss battles in the &quot;Gradius&quot; series involved combat with a giant craft, in the center of which would be situated one to several blue colored spheres. These bosses would be designed in such a way that there would be a straight passage from the exterior of the giant craft which leads directly to one of these cores. The player must fire shots into this passage while avoiding attack patterns from weapon emplacements on the body of the boss. However, small but destructible walls are situated in this passage, impeding the bullet shots from damaging the core, and must be whittled away by repeated well-placed shots. In a way, these tiny walls represent the boss&#x27; shielding gauge until its core is finally vulnerable to attack. Some bosses can regenerate these walls. When the core has sustained enough hits, it usually changes color from blue to red, indicating that it is in critical condition and its destruction is imminent. Upon the destruction of a core, a piece of the boss may be put out of commission, seeing that it is no longer powered by a core, or if all of the cores are destroyed, the entire boss is defeated and explodes satisfyingly. Note that these cores are not present on the more organic bosses of &quot;Gradius&quot;. Such bosses have weak spots in places such as a mouth, head or eye.

When gameplay begins, the Vic Viper is relatively slow and has only a weak gun. This level of capability is generally insufficient for engaging enemies, but the Vic Viper can gain greater capabilities by collecting and using power-up items. While most arcade games utilize distinct power up-items that each correspond to a specific effect on the player character, &quot;Gradius&quot; has a single power-up item. The effect of this power-up item is to advance the currently selected item in a power-up menu that appears at the bottom of the screen. When the desired power-up is highlighted, the player can obtain it by pressing the power-up button, returning the menu to its initial state in which no power-up is highlighted.

==Development==
&quot;Gradius&quot; was the creation of Konami game designer Machiguchi Hiroyasu, being the first video game he publicly released. Joining the company in the early 1980s originally as a programmer, Konami was trying to transition from being a producer of medal machines to a video game developer and assigned him to a small team to try and create a game that could put the company on the map. He asked the team what kind of game they&#x27;d like to work on, responding that they&#x27;d like to make another shooting game. The shoot&#x27;em up genre had seen a resurgence at the time with Namco&#x27;s &quot;Xevious&quot;, with the goal of the project being to make a shooter that could surpass it. The project was at first intended to be a followup to Konami&#x27;s earlier game &quot;Scramble&quot; (1981), being titled &quot;Scramble 2&quot; and reusing many of its material and game mechanics.

Development of &quot;Gradius&quot; lasted for about a year, which Hiroyasu says was filled with anxiety and worry from the production team due to it being their first game, lacking confidence in what they were doing. Members of the project came up with ideas that were then tested on the arcade monitor to see if they worked or not. While designing the Option satellites, the team tested over 20 different movement patterns for them, which were cut through the process of elimination based on those that didn&#x27;t work. The game was produced for the Konami Bubble System 16-bit arcade hardware, which gave the team more hardware capacity and memory to experiment with. Hiroyasu wanted the game to have a visually distinct world with unique enemies and locations, something relatively uncommon for shooters at the time. Inspiration for mechanics and the story were derived from films such as &quot;Star Wars: A New Hope&quot; and &quot;Lensman&quot;, with the Laser weapon being directly taken from those in &quot;Lensman&quot;. The idea for the power meter mechanic stemmed from the team&#x27;s desire to give players the freedom to select whichever weapons they pleased. Early versions had the player collecting individual pick-up icons, which were cut for not being &quot;satisfying&quot; enough; it was instead replaced with a selection bar where players collected capsules to allow access to other weapons, an idea based on the function keys on a keyboard. The Moai enemies were added to pay homage to &quot;Xevious&quot; and its Nazca lines, and as a way to give the game a sense of mystery.

==Releases==
===Arcade===
&quot;Gradius&quot; was first released in Japan for Konami&#x27;s Bubble System, an arcade board which allows operators to change the software through the use of proprietary &quot;Bubble Software&quot; cartridge media based on magnetic bubble memory. The game was distributed as a standard printed circuit board in North America and Europe under the title of &quot;Nemesis&quot;. The North American version of &quot;Nemesis&quot; features a considerably increased difficulty compared to the Japanese and European version. To balance this, the game spawns a fleet of orange enemies when the player loses a life to provide as many power-up capsules as possible to recover as many upgrades as possible. Also the North American version presents a continue feature (but only for three times). The title screen was also updated, showing an in-game reproduction of the promotional artwork behind the logo.

===Famicom/NES===
The first home conversion of &quot;Gradius&quot; was released for Nintendo&#x27;s Famicom console on April 25, 1986, in Japan. Due to the hardware limitations of the Famicom, many of the level designs were simplified (the Moai stage, for example, lacks the vertical scrolling present in the arcade game) and the maximum amount of options that the player can upgrade to was reduced from four to two. This version added a cheat code that can be entered while the game is paused that grants the player&#x27;s ship almost all the power-ups. This code would appear again in many later Konami on the NES and other consoles (such as &quot;Contra&quot; and &quot;Life Force&quot;), becoming known as the Konami Code.

The NES version of &quot;Gradius&quot; was released in North America in December 1986. It is the first NES game to have been released by Konami in the region and unlike the original arcade game, the title was kept unchanged between regions. The NES version was made available in arcades as a Nintendo VS. System board (under the title of &quot;VS. Gradius&quot;) and as a PlayChoice-10 cartridge. &quot;VS. Gradius&quot; was distributed to arcades by Nintendo.

===MSX===
The MSX version of &quot;Gradius&quot; was released on July 25, 1986, in Japan, a few months after the Famicom version. It was also released in Europe under the &quot;Nemesis&quot; title. This version changed similar to the Famicom version but adds its slew of exclusive content to make up for the downgrade. A new stage, the bone planet was added between the Inverted Volcano stage and the Antennoid stage, featuring exclusive enemy types. There also four hidden warp zones and the ability to play as the titular ship from &quot;TwinBee&quot; if the MSX version of that game is played alongside &quot;Nemesis&quot;.

===PC Engine===
The PC Engine version of &quot;Gradius&quot; was released on November 15, 1991, exclusively in Japan. Released on a 2-Megabit HuCard, it had relatively few omissions compared to the NES and MSX versions and added a Desert Planet stage similar to the Bone Planet stage from the MSX version. Because of the lower resolution of the PC Engine compared to the original arcade hardware, the PC Engine features some slight vertical-scrolling.

===Other platforms===
In addition to the MSX, &quot;Gradius&quot; was also ported to other microcomputers shortly after its release, such as the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64 in Europe (as &quot;Nemesis: The Final Challenge&quot;), as well as the PC-8801 and X1 in Japan. A port for the X68000 computer was also included in the early models of the computer.

The original &quot;Gradius&quot; is also included in collection such as &quot;Gradius Deluxe Pack&quot; for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and Microsoft Windows, and &quot;Gradius Collection&quot; for the PlayStation Portable. The arcade version was digitally released on the PlayStation 4 in 2015 and Nintendo Switch in July 2020 as part of the Arcade Archives series, with the option to play all four regional variants of the game. It is also included in the &quot;Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection&quot; released in 2019 by Konami themselves for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Windows.

==Audio==
*Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Vol.1 – 28XA-85) on 27 June 1986.
*Apollon Music released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Original Sound of Gradius – KHY1016) on 5 May 1987.
* Also, disc 1 of &quot;Konami Music Masterpiece Collection&quot;, which was released on October 1, 2004, is mostly devoted to &quot;Gradius&quot;.

==Reception==
===Arcade===
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Gradius&quot; on their July 1, 1985 issue as being the most-popular arcade game for the previous two weeks. It went on to be Japan&#x27;s fifth highest-grossing table arcade game of 1986. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Nemesis&quot; was the highest-grossing arcade game of 1986 on London&#x27;s Electrocoin charts.

Upon release, the arcade game received positive reviews from &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; and &quot;Computer Gamer&quot; magazines.

===Ports===
The Famicom version sold over one million copies in Japan during 1986. The home computer port went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, below &quot;Feud&quot;. The PC Engine version also topped the UK&#x27;s PC Engine sales chart in December 1991.

The first &quot;Famitsu&quot; Best Hit Game Awards gave the Famicom version of &quot;Gradius&quot; the award for Best Shooting Game and listed it as the second best Game of the Year (just below &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;). &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reviewed the home computer conversions and awarded it Game of the Month.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; later stated that &quot;Gradius&quot; was one of the toughest side-scrolling shooter games available on the NES, second only to &quot;Contra&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; gave the Wii Virtual Console re-release a rating 7 out of 10 and has hailed it as one of the greatest classic side-scrolling shooter games.

==Legacy==
&quot;Gradius&quot; spawned several sequels, the first of which was 1986&#x27;s &quot;Salamander&quot;. The series has continued into the seventh generation with &quot;Gradius ReBirth&quot;.

It was also re-released on Windows Store on December 20, 2013, GameNow in May 2014 and for PlayStation 4&#x27;s Arcade Archives on January 25 in Japan. An NES port was re-released for the Nintendo Switch Online on September 19, 2018, worldwide and an updated release as on November 14, 2018, worldwide. Another updated release titled Gradius SP: Second Loop was released worldwide on August 22, 2019.

<text>A gamemaster (GM; also known as game master, game manager, game moderator, referee, storyteller, or master of ceremonies) is a person who acts as a facilitator, organizer, officiant regarding rules, arbitrator, and moderator for a multiplayer role-playing game. The act performed by a gamemaster is sometimes referred to as &quot;gamemastering&quot; or simply &quot;GM-ing.&quot;

The role of a GM in a traditional tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) is to weave together the other participants&#x27; player-characters&#x27; (PCs) stories, control the non-player characters (NPCs), describe or create environments in which the PCs can interact, and solve any player disputes. This basic role is the same in almost all traditional TTRPGs, with minor differences specific to differing rule sets. However, in some indie role-playing games, the GM role significantly differs from the traditional pattern. For example, in Powered by the Apocalypse systems, the other players assist the GM in creating both the NPCs and the details of the campaign setting.

The role of a gamemaster in an online game is to enforce the game&#x27;s rules and provide general customer service. 

Gaming systems have their own names for the role of the GM. For example, in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, they are called dungeon masters, in the &quot;World of Darkness&quot; games, they are called storytellers, and in Powered by the Apocalypse games they are called a variety of names, such as MCs (master of ceremonies).

GMs are typically hobbyists; however, they are sometimes paid employees or entertainers for hire. This is more common for online games. Paid GMing was very uncommon for TTRPGs before the 2020s.

==History and variants of the term==
In a role-playing game context, the term &quot;gamemaster&quot; was first used by Dave Arneson while developing his game &quot;Blackmoor&quot; in 1971, although the first usage in print may have been &quot;Chivalry &amp; Sorcery&quot;. 

Each gaming system has its own name for the role of the gamemaster, such as &quot;judge,&quot; &quot;narrator,&quot; &quot;referee,&quot; &quot;director,&quot; or &quot;storyteller,&quot; and these terms not only describe the role of the GM in general but also help define how the game is intended to be run. For example, the most famous of such terms, the &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; (or &quot;DM&quot;) in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons,&quot; highlights the game&#x27;s focus on dungeon crawling. The Storyteller System used in White Wolf Game Studio&#x27;s storytelling games calls its GM the &quot;storyteller,&quot; while the rules- and setting-focused &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; role-playing game calls its GM the &quot;judge.&quot; The cartoon inspired role-playing game &quot;Toon&quot; calls its GM the &quot;animator.&quot; Some games apply flavorful names to the GM to fit the genre or setting, such as the Keeper of Arcane Lore (in the occult-themed &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;), the Hollyhock God (&quot;Nobilis&quot;, in which the hollyhock represents vanity), the Groundskeeper (in the spooky &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Bride&quot;), the Mall Rat (in Visigoths vs. Mall Goths), or the Gaymaster (in LGBTQ-centered &quot;Thirsty Sword Lesbians&quot;).

The term &quot;gamemaster&quot; and the role associated with it have been used in the postal gaming hobby since the 1980s. In typical play-by-mail games, players control armies or civilizations and mail their chosen actions to the GM. The GM then mails the updated game state to all players on a regular basis. Usage in a wargaming context includes Guidon Games 1973 ruleset, &quot;Ironclad&quot;.

==In traditional tabletop role-playing games==

The gamemaster prepares the game session for the players and the characters they play (known as player characters or PCs), describes the events taking place and decides on the outcomes of players&#x27; decisions. The gamemaster also keeps track of non-player characters (NPCs) and random encounters, as well as of the general state of the game world. The game session (or &quot;adventure&quot;) can be metaphorically described as a play, in which the players are the lead actors, and the GM provides the stage, the scenery, the basic plot on which the improvisational script is built, as well as all the bit parts and supporting characters. Gamemasters can also be in charge of RPG board games making the events and setting challenges.

GMs may choose to run a game based on a published game world, with the maps and history already in place; such game worlds often have pre-written adventures. Alternatively, the GM may build their own world and script their own adventures.

==In online games==
In early virtual worlds, gamemasters served as a moderator or administrator. In MUD game masters were called &quot;wizards.&quot; Gamemastering in the form found in traditional role-playing games has also been used in semi-automatic virtual worlds. However, human moderation was sometimes considered unfair or out of context in an otherwise automated world. As online games expanded, gamemaster duties expanded to include being a customer service representative for an online community. A gamemaster in such a game is either an experienced volunteer player or an employee of the game&#x27;s publisher. They enforce the game&#x27;s rules by banishing spammers, player killers, cheaters, and hackers and by solving players&#x27; problems by providing general customer service. For their tasks they use special tools and characters that allow them to do things like teleport to players, summon items, and browse logs that record players&#x27; activities.

&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; has employees of Blizzard Entertainment that serve as gamemasters to help users with various problems in gameplay, chat, and other things like account and billing issues. A gamemaster in this game will communicate with players through chat that has blue text and they will also have a special &quot;GM&quot; tag and Blizzard logo in front of their names.

&quot;RuneScape&quot; has more than 500 moderators employed by Jagex to assist players and perform administrative duties in-game and on the site forums. These &quot;Jagex Moderators&quot;, as they are called, usually have the word &quot;Mod&quot; and a gold crown preceding their account names which ordinary players are not permitted to use. The game also has &quot;Player Moderators&quot; and &quot;Forum Moderators&quot; who are player volunteers helping with moderation, having the ability to mute (block from chatting) other players who violate rules.

In &quot;Helldivers 2&quot;, a third-person shooter by Arrowhead Game Studios, a single employee named Joel Hakalax functions as a game master for the game&#x27;s colossal playerbase. The game features many real-time events where territory is gained or lost purportedly by the players&#x27; performance, which are determined at the discretion of the game master.

=== Additional online games ===

The now defunct &quot;America Online&quot; Online Gaming Forum used to use volunteers selected by applications from its user base. These people were simply referred to as OGFs by other members, and their screennames were indicative of their position (i.e., OGF Moose, etc.). While membership in the Online Gaming Forum had only one real requirement (that is, be a member of AOL), OGFs were given powers quite similar to AOL &quot;Guides&quot; and could use them at will to discipline users as they saw appropriate. &quot;Battleground Europe&quot;, a medium-sized MMOFPS, has a team of &quot;Game Moderators&quot;, anonymous volunteers who moderate the game. &quot;Miniconomy&quot;, a smaller text-based MMO, has a team of &quot;Federals&quot;, experienced players that help moderate the game and interactions. &quot;Transformice&quot;, an online multiplayer platformer, has a team of volunteer moderators called &quot;Mods&quot; who are experienced players that help moderate the game and interactions. &quot;ARMA 3&quot;, an open-world military tactical shooter, has a &quot;Zeus&quot; role that allows any player slotted in that role to place down almost any asset in the game including infantry and vehicles, objectives, intelligence, and score-keeping modules. The Zeus can also modify aspects of the world itself including time, weather, and wildlife to create dynamically progressing stories. &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; and &quot;&quot; are video game adaptations of tabletop role-playing games that are played online with one player acting as a traditional gamemaster.

==In pervasive games==
Gamemastering, sometimes referred to as Orchestration is used in pervasive games to guide players along a trajectory desired by the game author. To ensure proper gamemastering can take place, four components are needed: some kind of sensory system to the game allowing the game masters to know current events, providing dynamic game information; dynamic and static game information lets game masters make informed decisions; decisions need to be actuated into the game, either through the game system or through manual intervention; and finally a communication structure is needed for both diegetic or non-diegetic communication. Effective gamemastering can require specialized user interfaces that are highly game specific.

== Gamemaster simulation ==
Certain sourcebooks simulate the decisions of a gamemaster by various means for either group or solo gaming. These include works such as Mythic Game Master Emulator, which employs an oracle system to allow players to play TTRPGs without a gamemaster.

<text>Genetic engineering, also called genetic modification or genetic manipulation, is the modification and manipulation of an organism&#x27;s genes using technology. It is a set of technologies used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel organisms. New DNA is obtained by either isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using recombinant DNA methods or by artificially synthesising the DNA. A construct is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism. The first recombinant DNA molecule was made by Paul Berg in 1972 by combining DNA from the monkey virus SV40 with the lambda virus. As well as inserting genes, the process can be used to remove, or &quot;knock out&quot;, genes. The new DNA can be inserted randomly, or targeted to a specific part of the genome. 

An organism that is generated through genetic engineering is considered to be genetically modified (GM) and the resulting entity is a genetically modified organism (GMO). The first GMO was a bacterium generated by Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen in 1973. Rudolf Jaenisch created the first GM animal when he inserted foreign DNA into a mouse in 1974. The first company to focus on genetic engineering, Genentech, was founded in 1976 and started the production of human proteins. Genetically engineered human insulin was produced in 1978 and insulin-producing bacteria were commercialised in 1982. Genetically modified food has been sold since 1994, with the release of the Flavr Savr tomato. The Flavr Savr was engineered to have a longer shelf life, but most current GM crops are modified to increase resistance to insects and herbicides. GloFish, the first GMO designed as a pet, was sold in the United States in December 2003. In 2016 salmon modified with a growth hormone were sold.

Genetic engineering has been applied in numerous fields including research, medicine, industrial biotechnology and agriculture. In research, GMOs are used to study gene function and expression through loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression experiments. By knocking out genes responsible for certain conditions it is possible to create animal model organisms of human diseases. As well as producing hormones, vaccines and other drugs, genetic engineering has the potential to cure genetic diseases through gene therapy. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are used in industrial genetic engineering. Additionally mRNA vaccines are made through genetic engineering to prevent infections by viruses such as COVID-19. The same techniques that are used to produce drugs can also have industrial applications such as producing enzymes for laundry detergent, cheeses and other products.

The rise of commercialised genetically modified crops has provided economic benefit to farmers in many different countries, but has also been the source of most of the controversy surrounding the technology. This has been present since its early use; the first field trials were destroyed by anti-GM activists. Although there is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, critics consider GM food safety a leading concern. Gene flow, impact on non-target organisms, control of the food supply and intellectual property rights have also been raised as potential issues. These concerns have led to the development of a regulatory framework, which started in 1975. It has led to an international treaty, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, that was adopted in 2000. Individual countries have developed their own regulatory systems regarding GMOs, with the most marked differences occurring between the United States and Europe.

==Overview==

Genetic engineering is a process that alters the genetic structure of an organism by either removing or introducing DNA, or modifying existing genetic material in situ. Unlike traditional animal and plant breeding, which involves doing multiple crosses and then selecting for the organism with the desired phenotype, genetic engineering takes the gene directly from one organism and delivers it to the other. This is much faster, can be used to insert any genes from any organism (even ones from different domains) and prevents other undesirable genes from also being added.

Genetic engineering could potentially fix severe genetic disorders in humans by replacing the defective gene with a functioning one. It is an important tool in research that allows the function of specific genes to be studied. Drugs, vaccines and other products have been harvested from organisms engineered to produce them. Crops have been developed that aid food security by increasing yield, nutritional value and tolerance to environmental stresses.

The DNA can be introduced directly into the host organism or into a cell that is then fused or hybridised with the host. This relies on recombinant nucleic acid techniques to form new combinations of heritable genetic material followed by the incorporation of that material either indirectly through a vector system or directly through micro-injection, macro-injection or micro-encapsulation. 

Genetic engineering does not normally include traditional breeding, in vitro fertilisation, induction of polyploidy, mutagenesis and cell fusion techniques that do not use recombinant nucleic acids or a genetically modified organism in the process. However, some broad definitions of genetic engineering include selective breeding. Cloning and stem cell research, although not considered genetic engineering, are closely related and genetic engineering can be used within them. Synthetic biology is an emerging discipline that takes genetic engineering a step further by introducing artificially synthesised material into an organism.

Plants, animals or microorganisms that have been changed through genetic engineering are termed genetically modified organisms or GMOs. If genetic material from another species is added to the host, the resulting organism is called transgenic. If genetic material from the same species or a species that can naturally breed with the host is used the resulting organism is called cisgenic. If genetic engineering is used to remove genetic material from the target organism the resulting organism is termed a knockout organism. In Europe genetic modification is synonymous with genetic engineering while within the United States of America and Canada genetic modification can also be used to refer to more conventional breeding methods.

==History==
Humans have altered the genomes of species for thousands of years through selective breeding, or artificial selection as contrasted with natural selection. More recently, mutation breeding has used exposure to chemicals or radiation to produce a high frequency of random mutations, for selective breeding purposes. Genetic engineering as the direct manipulation of DNA by humans outside breeding and mutations has only existed since the 1970s. The term &quot;genetic engineering&quot; was coined by the Russian-born geneticist Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky in his 1934 paper &quot;The Experimental Production of Mutations&quot;, published in the British journal Biological Reviews. Jack Williamson used the term in his science fiction novel Dragon&#x27;s Island, published in 1951 – one year before DNA&#x27;s role in heredity was confirmed by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase, and two years before James Watson and Francis Crick showed that the DNA molecule has a double-helix structure – though the general concept of direct genetic manipulation was explored in rudimentary form in Stanley G. Weinbaum&#x27;s 1936 science fiction story &quot;Proteus Island&quot;.

In 1972, Paul Berg created the first recombinant DNA molecules by combining DNA from the monkey virus SV40 with that of the lambda virus. In 1973 Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen created the first transgenic organism by inserting antibiotic resistance genes into the plasmid of an &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; bacterium. A year later Rudolf Jaenisch created a transgenic mouse by introducing foreign DNA into its embryo, making it the world&#x27;s first transgenic animal These achievements led to concerns in the scientific community about potential risks from genetic engineering, which were first discussed in depth at the Asilomar Conference in 1975. One of the main recommendations from this meeting was that government oversight of recombinant DNA research should be established until the technology was deemed safe.

In 1976 Genentech, the first genetic engineering company, was founded by Herbert Boyer and Robert Swanson and a year later the company produced a human protein (somatostatin) in &quot;E. coli&quot;. Genentech announced the production of genetically engineered human insulin in 1978. In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court in the &quot;Diamond v. Chakrabarty&quot; case ruled that genetically altered life could be patented. The insulin produced by bacteria was approved for release by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1982.

In 1983, a biotech company, Advanced Genetic Sciences (AGS) applied for U.S. government authorisation to perform field tests with the ice-minus strain of &quot;Pseudomonas syringae&quot; to protect crops from frost, but environmental groups and protestors delayed the field tests for four years with legal challenges. In 1987, the ice-minus strain of &quot;P. syringae&quot; became the first genetically modified organism (GMO) to be released into the environment when a strawberry field and a potato field in California were sprayed with it. Both test fields were attacked by activist groups the night before the tests occurred: &quot;The world&#x27;s first trial site attracted the world&#x27;s first field trasher&quot;.

The first field trials of genetically engineered plants occurred in France and the US in 1986, tobacco plants were engineered to be resistant to herbicides. The People&#x27;s Republic of China was the first country to commercialise transgenic plants, introducing a virus-resistant tobacco in 1992. In 1994 Calgene attained approval to commercially release the first genetically modified food, the Flavr Savr, a tomato engineered to have a longer shelf life. In 1994, the European Union approved tobacco engineered to be resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil, making it the first genetically engineered crop commercialised in Europe. In 1995, Bt potato was approved safe by the Environmental Protection Agency, after having been approved by the FDA, making it the first pesticide producing crop to be approved in the US. In 2009 11 transgenic crops were grown commercially in 25 countries, the largest of which by area grown were the US, Brazil, Argentina, India, Canada, China, Paraguay and South Africa.

In 2010, scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute created the first synthetic genome and inserted it into an empty bacterial cell. The resulting bacterium, named Mycoplasma laboratorium, could replicate and produce proteins. Four years later this was taken a step further when a bacterium was developed that replicated a plasmid containing a unique base pair, creating the first organism engineered to use an expanded genetic alphabet. In 2012, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier collaborated to develop the CRISPR/Cas9 system, a technique which can be used to easily and specifically alter the genome of almost any organism.

==Process==
Creating a GMO is a multi-step process. Genetic engineers must first choose what gene they wish to insert into the organism. This is driven by what the aim is for the resultant organism and is built on earlier research. Genetic screens can be carried out to determine potential genes and further tests then used to identify the best candidates. The development of microarrays, transcriptomics and genome sequencing has made it much easier to find suitable genes. Luck also plays its part; the Roundup Ready gene was discovered after scientists noticed a bacterium thriving in the presence of the herbicide.

=== Gene isolation and cloning ===

The next step is to isolate the candidate gene. The cell containing the gene is opened and the DNA is purified. The gene is separated by using restriction enzymes to cut the DNA into fragments or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify up the gene segment. These segments can then be extracted through gel electrophoresis. If the chosen gene or the donor organism&#x27;s genome has been well studied it may already be accessible from a genetic library. If the DNA sequence is known, but no copies of the gene are available, it can also be artificially synthesised. Once isolated the gene is ligated into a plasmid that is then inserted into a bacterium. The plasmid is replicated when the bacteria divide, ensuring unlimited copies of the gene are available. The RK2 plasmid is notable for its ability to replicate in a wide variety of single-celled organisms, which makes it suitable as a genetic engineering tool.

Before the gene is inserted into the target organism it must be combined with other genetic elements. These include a promoter and terminator region, which initiate and end transcription. A selectable marker gene is added, which in most cases confers antibiotic resistance, so researchers can easily determine which cells have been successfully transformed. The gene can also be modified at this stage for better expression or effectiveness. These manipulations are carried out using recombinant DNA techniques, such as restriction digests, ligations and molecular cloning.

===Inserting DNA into the host genome===
There are a number of techniques used to insert genetic material into the host genome. Some bacteria can naturally take up foreign DNA. This ability can be induced in other bacteria via stress (e.g. thermal or electric shock), which increases the cell membrane&#x27;s permeability to DNA; up-taken DNA can either integrate with the genome or exist as extrachromosomal DNA. DNA is generally inserted into animal cells using microinjection, where it can be injected through the cell&#x27;s nuclear envelope directly into the nucleus, or through the use of viral vectors.

Plant genomes can be engineered by physical methods or by use of &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; for the delivery of sequences hosted in T-DNA binary vectors. In plants the DNA is often inserted using &quot;Agrobacterium&quot;-mediated transformation, taking advantage of the &quot;Agrobacterium&quot;s T-DNA sequence that allows natural insertion of genetic material into plant cells. Other methods include biolistics, where particles of gold or tungsten are coated with DNA and then shot into young plant cells, and electroporation, which involves using an electric shock to make the cell membrane permeable to plasmid DNA.

As only a single cell is transformed with genetic material, the organism must be regenerated from that single cell. In plants this is accomplished through the use of tissue culture. In animals it is necessary to ensure that the inserted DNA is present in the embryonic stem cells. Bacteria consist of a single cell and reproduce clonally so regeneration is not necessary. Selectable markers are used to easily differentiate transformed from untransformed cells. These markers are usually present in the transgenic organism, although a number of strategies have been developed that can remove the selectable marker from the mature transgenic plant.

Further testing using PCR, Southern hybridization, and DNA sequencing is conducted to confirm that an organism contains the new gene. These tests can also confirm the chromosomal location and copy number of the inserted gene. The presence of the gene does not guarantee it will be expressed at appropriate levels in the target tissue so methods that look for and measure the gene products (RNA and protein) are also used. These include northern hybridisation, quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence, ELISA and phenotypic analysis.

The new genetic material can be inserted randomly within the host genome or targeted to a specific location. The technique of gene targeting uses homologous recombination to make desired changes to a specific endogenous gene. This tends to occur at a relatively low frequency in plants and animals and generally requires the use of selectable markers. The frequency of gene targeting can be greatly enhanced through genome editing. Genome editing uses artificially engineered nucleases that create specific double-stranded breaks at desired locations in the genome, and use the cell&#x27;s endogenous mechanisms to repair the induced break by the natural processes of homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining. There are four families of engineered nucleases: meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the Cas9-guideRNA system (adapted from CRISPR). TALEN and CRISPR are the two most commonly used and each has its own advantages. TALENs have greater target specificity, while CRISPR is easier to design and more efficient. In addition to enhancing gene targeting, engineered nucleases can be used to introduce mutations at endogenous genes that generate a gene knockout.

== Applications ==

Genetic engineering has applications in medicine, research, industry and agriculture and can be used on a wide range of plants, animals and microorganisms. Bacteria, the first organisms to be genetically modified, can have plasmid DNA inserted containing new genes that code for medicines or enzymes that process food and other substrates. Plants have been modified for insect protection, herbicide resistance, virus resistance, enhanced nutrition, tolerance to environmental pressures and the production of edible vaccines. Most commercialised GMOs are insect resistant or herbicide tolerant crop plants. Genetically modified animals have been used for research, model animals and the production of agricultural or pharmaceutical products. The genetically modified animals include animals with genes knocked out, increased susceptibility to disease, hormones for extra growth and the ability to express proteins in their milk.

=== Medicine ===

Genetic engineering has many applications to medicine that include the manufacturing of drugs, creation of model animals that mimic human conditions and gene therapy. One of the earliest uses of genetic engineering was to mass-produce human insulin in bacteria. This application has now been applied to human growth hormones, follicle stimulating hormones (for treating infertility), human albumin, monoclonal antibodies, antihemophilic factors, vaccines and many other drugs. Mouse hybridomas, cells fused together to create monoclonal antibodies, have been adapted through genetic engineering to create human monoclonal antibodies. Genetically engineered viruses are being developed that can still confer immunity, but lack the infectious sequences.

Genetic engineering is also used to create animal models of human diseases. Genetically modified mice are the most common genetically engineered animal model. They have been used to study and model cancer (the oncomouse), obesity, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, substance abuse, anxiety, aging and Parkinson disease. Potential cures can be tested against these mouse models. 

Gene therapy is the genetic engineering of humans, generally by replacing defective genes with effective ones. Clinical research using somatic gene therapy has been conducted with several diseases, including X-linked SCID, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In 2012, Alipogene tiparvovec became the first gene therapy treatment to be approved for clinical use. In 2015 a virus was used to insert a healthy gene into the skin cells of a boy suffering from a rare skin disease, epidermolysis bullosa, in order to grow, and then graft healthy skin onto 80 percent of the boy&#x27;s body which was affected by the illness.

Germline gene therapy would result in any change being inheritable, which has raised concerns within the scientific community. In 2015, CRISPR was used to edit the DNA of non-viable human embryos, leading scientists of major world academies to call for a moratorium on inheritable human genome edits. There are also concerns that the technology could be used not just for treatment, but for enhancement, modification or alteration of a human beings&#x27; appearance, adaptability, intelligence, character or behavior. The distinction between cure and enhancement can also be difficult to establish. In November 2018, He Jiankui announced that he had edited the genomes of two human embryos, to attempt to disable the &quot;CCR5&quot; gene, which codes for a receptor that HIV uses to enter cells. The work was widely condemned as unethical, dangerous, and premature. Currently, germline modification is banned in 40 countries. Scientists that do this type of research will often let embryos grow for a few days without allowing it to develop into a baby.

Researchers are altering the genome of pigs to induce the growth of human organs, with the aim of increasing the success of pig to human organ transplantation. Scientists are creating &quot;gene drives&quot;, changing the genomes of mosquitoes to make them immune to malaria, and then looking to spread the genetically altered mosquitoes throughout the mosquito population in the hopes of eliminating the disease.

=== Research ===

Genetic engineering is an important tool for natural scientists, with the creation of transgenic organisms one of the most important tools for analysis of gene function. Genes and other genetic information from a wide range of organisms can be inserted into bacteria for storage and modification, creating genetically modified bacteria in the process. Bacteria are cheap, easy to grow, clonal, multiply quickly, relatively easy to transform and can be stored at -80 °C almost indefinitely. Once a gene is isolated it can be stored inside the bacteria providing an unlimited supply for research.

Organisms are genetically engineered to discover the functions of certain genes. This could be the effect on the phenotype of the organism, where the gene is expressed or what other genes it interacts with. These experiments generally involve loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression.

* Loss of function experiments, such as in a gene knockout experiment, in which an organism is engineered to lack the activity of one or more genes. In a simple knockout a copy of the desired gene has been altered to make it non-functional. Embryonic stem cells incorporate the altered gene, which replaces the already present functional copy. These stem cells are injected into blastocysts, which are implanted into surrogate mothers. This allows the experimenter to analyse the defects caused by this mutation and thereby determine the role of particular genes. It is used especially frequently in developmental biology. When this is done by creating a library of genes with point mutations at every position in the area of interest, or even every position in the whole gene, this is called &quot;scanning mutagenesis&quot;. The simplest method, and the first to be used, is &quot;alanine scanning&quot;, where every position in turn is mutated to the unreactive amino acid alanine.
* Gain of function experiments, the logical counterpart of knockouts. These are sometimes performed in conjunction with knockout experiments to more finely establish the function of the desired gene. The process is much the same as that in knockout engineering, except that the construct is designed to increase the function of the gene, usually by providing extra copies of the gene or inducing synthesis of the protein more frequently. Gain of function is used to tell whether or not a protein is sufficient for a function, but does not always mean it is required, especially when dealing with genetic or functional redundancy.
* Tracking experiments, which seek to gain information about the localisation and interaction of the desired protein. One way to do this is to replace the wild-type gene with a &#x27;fusion&#x27; gene, which is a juxtaposition of the wild-type gene with a reporting element such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) that will allow easy visualisation of the products of the genetic modification. While this is a useful technique, the manipulation can destroy the function of the gene, creating secondary effects and possibly calling into question the results of the experiment. More sophisticated techniques are now in development that can track protein products without mitigating their function, such as the addition of small sequences that will serve as binding motifs to monoclonal antibodies.
* Expression studies aim to discover where and when specific proteins are produced. In these experiments, the DNA sequence before the DNA that codes for a protein, known as a gene&#x27;s promoter, is reintroduced into an organism with the protein coding region replaced by a reporter gene such as GFP or an enzyme that catalyses the production of a dye. Thus the time and place where a particular protein is produced can be observed. Expression studies can be taken a step further by altering the promoter to find which pieces are crucial for the proper expression of the gene and are actually bound by transcription factor proteins; this process is known as promoter bashing.

=== Industrial ===
Organisms can have their cells transformed with a gene coding for a useful protein, such as an enzyme, so that they will overexpress the desired protein. Mass quantities of the protein can then be manufactured by growing the transformed organism in bioreactor equipment using industrial fermentation, and then purifying the protein. Some genes do not work well in bacteria, so yeast, insect cells or mammalian cells can also be used. These techniques are used to produce medicines such as insulin, human growth hormone, and vaccines, supplements such as tryptophan, aid in the production of food (chymosin in cheese making) and fuels. Other applications with genetically engineered bacteria could involve making them perform tasks outside their natural cycle, such as making biofuels, cleaning up oil spills, carbon and other toxic waste and detecting arsenic in drinking water. Certain genetically modified microbes can also be used in biomining and bioremediation, due to their ability to extract heavy metals from their environment and incorporate them into compounds that are more easily recoverable.

In materials science, a genetically modified virus has been used in a research laboratory as a scaffold for assembling a more environmentally friendly lithium-ion battery. Bacteria have also been engineered to function as sensors by expressing a fluorescent protein under certain environmental conditions.

===Agriculture===

One of the best-known and controversial applications of genetic engineering is the creation and use of genetically modified crops or genetically modified livestock to produce genetically modified food. Crops have been developed to increase production, increase tolerance to abiotic stresses, alter the composition of the food, or to produce novel products.

The first crops to be released commercially on a large scale provided protection from insect pests or tolerance to herbicides. Fungal and virus resistant crops have also been developed or are in development. This makes the insect and weed management of crops easier and can indirectly increase crop yield. GM crops that directly improve yield by accelerating growth or making the plant more hardy (by improving salt, cold or drought tolerance) are also under development. In 2016 Salmon have been genetically modified with growth hormones to reach normal adult size much faster.

GMOs have been developed that modify the quality of produce by increasing the nutritional value or providing more industrially useful qualities or quantities. The Amflora potato produces a more industrially useful blend of starches. Soybeans and canola have been genetically modified to produce more healthy oils. The first commercialised GM food was a tomato that had delayed ripening, increasing its shelf life.

Plants and animals have been engineered to produce materials they do not normally make. Pharming uses crops and animals as bioreactors to produce vaccines, drug intermediates, or the drugs themselves; the useful product is purified from the harvest and then used in the standard pharmaceutical production process. Cows and goats have been engineered to express drugs and other proteins in their milk, and in 2009 the FDA approved a drug produced in goat milk.

=== Other applications ===
Genetic engineering has potential applications in conservation and natural area management. Gene transfer through viral vectors has been proposed as a means of controlling invasive species as well as vaccinating threatened fauna from disease. Transgenic trees have been suggested as a way to confer resistance to pathogens in wild populations. With the increasing risks of maladaptation in organisms as a result of climate change and other perturbations, facilitated adaptation through gene tweaking could be one solution to reducing extinction risks. Applications of genetic engineering in conservation are thus far mostly theoretical and have yet to be put into practice.

Genetic engineering is also being used to create microbial art. Some bacteria have been genetically engineered to create black and white photographs. Novelty items such as lavender-colored carnations, blue roses, and glowing fish, have also been produced through genetic engineering.

==Regulation==

The regulation of genetic engineering concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the development and release of GMOs. The development of a regulatory framework began in 1975, at Asilomar, California. The Asilomar meeting recommended a set of voluntary guidelines regarding the use of recombinant technology. As the technology improved the US established a committee at the Office of Science and Technology, which assigned regulatory approval of GM food to the USDA, FDA and EPA. The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, an international treaty that governs the transfer, handling, and use of GMOs, was adopted on 29 January 2000. One hundred and fifty-seven countries are members of the Protocol, and many use it as a reference point for their own regulations.

The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation. Some countries allow the import of GM food with authorisation, but either do not allow its cultivation (Russia, Norway, Israel) or have provisions for cultivation even though no GM products are yet produced (Japan, South Korea). Most countries that do not allow GMO cultivation do permit research. Some of the most marked differences occur between the US and Europe. The US policy focuses on the product (not the process), only looks at verifiable scientific risks and uses the concept of substantial equivalence. The European Union by contrast has possibly the most stringent GMO regulations in the world. All GMOs, along with irradiated food, are considered &quot;new food&quot; and subject to extensive, case-by-case, science-based food evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority. The criteria for authorisation fall in four broad categories: &quot;safety&quot;, &quot;freedom of choice&quot;, &quot;labelling&quot;, and &quot;traceability&quot;. The level of regulation in other countries that cultivate GMOs lie in between Europe and the United States.
One of the key issues concerning regulators is whether GM products should be labeled. The European Commission says that mandatory labeling and traceability are needed to allow for informed choice, avoid potential false advertising and facilitate the withdrawal of products if adverse effects on health or the environment are discovered. The American Medical Association and the American Association for the Advancement of Science say that absent scientific evidence of harm even voluntary labeling is misleading and will falsely alarm consumers. Labeling of GMO products in the marketplace is required in 64 countries. Labeling can be mandatory up to a threshold GM content level (which varies between countries) or voluntary. In Canada and the US labeling of GM food is voluntary, while in Europe all food (including processed food) or feed which contains greater than 0.9% of approved GMOs must be labelled.

==Controversy==

Critics have objected to the use of genetic engineering on several grounds, including ethical, ecological and economic concerns. Many of these concerns involve GM crops and whether food produced from them is safe and what impact growing them will have on the environment. These controversies have led to litigation, international trade disputes, and protests, and to restrictive regulation of commercial products in some countries.

Accusations that scientists are &quot;playing God&quot; and other religious issues have been ascribed to the technology from the beginning. Other ethical issues raised include the patenting of life, the use of intellectual property rights, the level of labeling on products, control of the food supply and the objectivity of the regulatory process. Although doubts have been raised, economically most studies have found growing GM crops to be beneficial to farmers.

Gene flow between GM crops and compatible plants, along with increased use of selective herbicides, can increase the risk of &quot;superweeds&quot; developing. Other environmental concerns involve potential impacts on non-target organisms, including soil microbes, and an increase in secondary and resistant insect pests. Many of the environmental impacts regarding GM crops may take many years to be understood and are also evident in conventional agriculture practices. With the commercialisation of genetically modified fish there are concerns over what the environmental consequences will be if they escape.

There are three main concerns over the safety of genetically modified food: whether they may provoke an allergic reaction; whether the genes could transfer from the food into human cells; and whether the genes not approved for human consumption could outcross to other crops. There is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe.

==In popular culture==

Genetic engineering features in many science fiction stories. Frank Herbert&#x27;s novel &quot;The White Plague&quot; describes the deliberate use of genetic engineering to create a pathogen which specifically kills women. Another of Herbert&#x27;s creations, the &quot;Dune&quot; series of novels, uses genetic engineering to create the powerful Tleilaxu. Few films have informed audiences about genetic engineering, with the exception of the 1978 &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; and the 1993 &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, both of which make use of a lesson, a demonstration, and a clip of scientific film. Genetic engineering methods are weakly represented in film; Michael Clark, writing for the Wellcome Trust, calls the portrayal of genetic engineering and biotechnology &quot;seriously distorted&quot; in films such as &quot;The 6th Day&quot;. In Clark&#x27;s view, the biotechnology is typically &quot;given fantastic but visually arresting forms&quot; while the science is either relegated to the background or fictionalised to suit a young audience.

<text>The Gettysburg Address is a speech delivered by Abraham Lincoln, the 16th U.S. president, following the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. The speech has come to be viewed as one of the most famous, enduring, and historically significant speeches in American history.

Lincoln delivered the speech on the afternoon of November 19, 1863, during a formal dedication of Soldiers&#x27; National Cemetery, now known as Gettysburg National Cemetery, on the grounds where the Battle of Gettysburg was fought four and a half months earlier, between July 1 and July 3, 1863, in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. In the battle, Union army soldiers successfully repelled and defeated Confederate forces in what proved to be both the Civil War&#x27;s deadliest and most decisive battle, resulting in over 50,000 Confederate and Union army casualties in a Union victory, which altered the war&#x27;s course in the Union&#x27;s favor.

The historical and enduring significance and fame of the Gettysburg Address is at least partly attributable to its conscious brevity, including only 271 words and comprising less than two minutes before a crowd of approximately 15,000 people, which gathered to join in commemorating the sacrifice of the Union soldiers, over 23,000 of whom were killed over the three day Battle of Gettysburg. In his brief but historical speech, Lincoln described the Union&#x27;s cause in the Civil War as necessary to validate that the sovereignty and freedoms the nation successfully secured less than nine decades earlier in the American Revolution, Revolutionary War, and nation&#x27;s establishment, could prove enduring.

Despite the historical significance and fame that the speech ultimately obtained, Lincoln was not intended to serve as the primary speaker at the cemetery&#x27;s dedication that day, and his brief speech consumed a very small fraction of the day&#x27;s event, which lasted for several hours. Nor was Lincoln&#x27;s address immediately recognized as particularly significant. Over time, however, it came to be viewed widely as one of the greatest and most influential statements ever delivered on the American national purpose, enduring in significance throughout the nation&#x27;s history, and also as one of the most prominent examples of the successful use of the English language and rhetoric to advance a political cause. &quot;The Gettysburg Address did not enter the broader American canon until decades after Lincoln’s death, following World War I and the 1922 opening of the Lincoln Memorial, where the speech is etched in marble. As the Gettysburg Address gained in popularity, it became a staple of school textbooks and readers, and the succinctness of the three paragraph oration permitted it to be memorized by generations of American school children,&quot; the History Channel reported in November 2024.

Lincoln began his 271-word address in Gettysburg with the now famed phrase, &quot;Four score and seven years ago&quot;, a reference to the nation&#x27;s founding in the American Revolution, during which the Founding Fathers ultimately concluded that they could not reconcile their differences with King George III and instead needed to enjoin and prevail in the Revolutionary War in pursuit of full independence from British colonial rule. In 1775, the Second Continental Congress, convened in the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia, then established the Continental Army and elected George Washington as its commander-in-chief against the British. The following year, in 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted and issued the Declaration of Independence, which detailed why the Thirteen Colonies believed they were free and independent from British colonial rule.

In the Gettysburg Address, Lincoln prominently referenced the nation&#x27;s founding, describing it as having been &quot;conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal&quot;, a reference to a phrase incorporated into the Declaration by Thomas Jefferson. Lincoln described the Civil War as questioning and testing whether such a nation could endure, extolled the sacrifices of the thousands who died in the Battle of Gettysburg in defense of those principles, and then argued that their sacrifice should elevate the nation&#x27;s commitment to ensuring the Union prevailed and the nation endured, famously saying:

==Background==
In inviting President Lincoln to speak at the ceremony, David Wills, a member of the committee for the November 19 Consecration of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg, wrote, &quot;It is the desire that, after the Oration, you, as Chief Executive of the nation, formally set apart these grounds to their sacred use by a few appropriate remarks.&quot;

On November 18, 1863, Lincoln departed Washington, D.C. for Gettysburg, accompanied by three of his cabinet members, William Seward, John Usher, and Montgomery Blair, several foreign officials, his secretary John Nicolay, and his assistant secretary, John Hay. During the trip, Lincoln told Hay that he felt weak. The following morning, on November 19, Lincoln mentioned to Nicolay that he felt dizzy. Hay noted during the speech that Lincoln&#x27;s face had &quot;a ghastly color&quot; and that he was &quot;sad, mournful, almost haggard&quot;. After the speech, when Lincoln boarded the 6:30pm train to return to Washington, D.C., he was feverish and weak with a severe headache. He was subsequently diagnosed with a mild case of smallpox, which included a vesicular rash. Modern clinicians believe that Lincoln was likely in a prodromal period of smallpox when he delivered the Gettysburg Address.

Lincoln arrived in Gettysburg later that night, just as the city was beginning to fill with large crowds who had arrived to participate in it the following day. Lincoln spent the night in Wills&#x27; house, where a large crowd appeared, singing and wanting Lincoln to speak. Lincoln left Wills&#x27; house to meet the crowd, but did not deliver any formal remarks, instead speaking briefly and extemporaneously. The crowd then continued on to the house where Lincoln&#x27;s Secretary of State William Seward was staying that night. Seward spoke to crowd. Later that night, Lincoln wrote and briefly met with Seward before going to sleep around midnight.

==Program==

The program that Wills and his committee organized for the day:

Music by Birgfeld&#x27;s Band(&quot;Homage d&#x27;uns Heros&quot; by Adolph Birgfeld)
*Prayer, by Reverend T. H. Stockton
*&quot;Old Hundred&quot; performed by the U.S. Marine Band, directed by Francis Scala
*Oration, by Hon. Edward Everett (&quot;The Battles of Gettysburg&quot;)
*Music, Hymn (&quot;Consecration Chant&quot;) by B. B. French, Esq., music by Wilson G Horner, sung by the Baltimore Glee Club
*Dedicatory remarks by the President of the United States
*Dirge, &quot;Oh! It is Great for Our Country to Die&quot;, by James G. Percival with music by Alfred Delaney
*Benediction, given by Reverend H. L. Baugher

While Lincoln&#x27;s short address proved far and away the most historically notable that day, and is often held out an example of English public oratory, Everett&#x27;s oration was slated to be the primary speech of the day. His now seldom read speech was 13,607 words in length, and lasted two hours. During this era, lengthy dedication addresses of cemeteries, like the one delivered by Everett, were very common. The tradition began in 1831 when Justice Joseph Story delivered a lengthy dedication address at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Many of the lengthy addresses of the era linked cemeteries to the mission of the Union.

==Text==
Shortly after Everett concluded his lengthy speech, which was well received by the crowd, Lincoln rose and, from the speakers&#x27; podium, addressed the crowd for only approximately two minutes. His 271-word speech was ten sentences long.

Despite the historical significance of Lincoln&#x27;s speech, modern scholars disagree on the precise wording in Lincoln&#x27;s speech, and contemporary transcriptions published in newspaper accounts of the event and several of Lincoln&#x27;s handwritten copies of the address differ slightly in wording, punctuation, and structure. Among these versions, the Bliss version, written by Lincoln after the speech as a favor for a friend, is viewed by many as the standard text. Its text differs, however, from the written versions prepared by Lincoln before and after his speech. But it is the only version which includes Lincoln&#x27;s signature, and the last version of the speech that he is known to have written. The Bliss version is as follows:


==Lincoln&#x27;s sources==
In &quot;Lincoln at Gettysburg&quot;, Garry Wills notes the parallels between Lincoln&#x27;s speech and Pericles&#x27;s Funeral Oration during the Peloponnesian War, described by Thucydides. Pericles&#x27; speech, like Lincoln&#x27;s:

* Begins with an acknowledgment of revered predecessors: &quot;I shall begin with our ancestors: it is both just and proper that they should have the honor of the first mention on an occasion like the present&quot;
* Praises the uniqueness of the State&#x27;s commitment to democracy: &quot;If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences&quot;
* Honors the sacrifice of the slain, &quot;Thus choosing to die resisting, rather than to live submitting, they fled only from dishonor, but met danger face to face&quot;
* Exhorts the living to continue the struggle: &quot;You, their survivors, must determine to have as unfaltering a resolution in the field, though you may pray that it may have a happier issue.&quot;

James M. McPherson notes this connection in his review of Wills&#x27;s book. Gore Vidal also draws attention to this link in a BBC documentary about oration.

In contrast, writer Adam Gopnik, in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, notes that Everett&#x27;s Oration was explicitly neoclassical, referring directly to Marathon and Pericles. &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s rhetoric is, instead, deliberately Biblical. (It is difficult to find a single obviously classical reference in any of his speeches.) Lincoln had mastered the sound of the King James Bible so completely that he could recast abstract issues of constitutional law in Biblical terms, making the proposition that Texas and New Hampshire should be forever bound by a single post office sound like something right out of Genesis,&quot; Gopnik wrote.

Wills also observed Lincoln&#x27;s usage of the imagery of birth, life, and death in the address, during which he referenced the nation as being &quot;brought forth&quot;, &quot;conceived&quot;, and saying that it shall not &quot;perish&quot;. A 1959 thesis by William J. Wolf suggested that the address had a central image of baptism, although Glenn LaFantasie, writing for the &quot;Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association&quot;, believes that Wolf&#x27;s position was likely an overstatement. Philip B. Kunhardt Jr. suggests that Lincoln was inspired by the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;.

Allen C. Guelzo, director of Civil War-era studies at Gettysburg College in Gettysburg and others have suggested that Lincoln&#x27;s phrase, &quot;four score and seven&quot;, was an indirect reference to the King James Version of the Bible in which man&#x27;s lifespan is described as &quot;threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years&quot;. LaFantasie also connected &quot;four score and seven years&quot; with Psalms 90:10, and referred to Lincoln&#x27;s usage of the phrase &quot;our fathers&quot; as &quot;mindful of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;. He also refers to Garry Wills&#x27;s tracing of spiritual language in the address to the Gospel of Luke.

===&quot;Government of the people, by the people, for the people&quot;===

Lincoln scholars maintain several theories on Lincoln&#x27;s use of his famed phrase &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people&quot; in the Gettysburg Address Despite some claims to the contrary, there is no evidence that a similar phrase appears in the prologue of John Wycliffe&#x27;s 1384 English translation of the Bible.

In a discussion, &quot;A more probable origin of a famous Lincoln phrase&quot; in 1901, published in &quot;The American Monthly Review of Reviews&quot;, Unitarian minister John White Chadwick observed that William Herndon, Lincoln&#x27;s law partner who authored &quot;Abraham Lincoln: The True Story of A Great Life&quot; in 1888, was known to bring Lincoln several sermons by Theodore Parker, an abolitionist minister from Massachusetts, which proved inspiring and influential to Lincoln, writing that:

Craig R. Smith, in &quot;Criticism of Political Rhetoric and Disciplinary Integrity&quot;, published in 2000, suggested that the views of government that Lincoln described in the Gettysburg Address were influenced by Daniel Webster, a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts. In Webster&#x27;s &quot;Second Reply to Hayne&quot; speech, delivered in the U.S. Senate on January 26, 1830, Webster said that, &quot;Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!&quot; Webster described the federal government as, &quot;made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people&quot;, potentially influencing Lincoln&#x27;s development of the phrase &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people&quot;, one of the most prominent sentences of the Gettysburg Address. Webster, in turn, may have been influenced by an 1819 speech by John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton, who said, &quot;I am a man chosen for the people, by the people; and, if elected, I will do no other business than that of the people.&quot; In Webster&#x27;s 1830 speech to the U.S. Senate, he said, &quot;This government, Sir, is the independent offspring of the popular will. It is not the creature of State legislatures; nay, more, if the whole truth must be told, the people brought it into existence, established it, and have hitherto supported it, for the very purpose, amongst others, of imposing certain salutary restraints on State sovereignties.&quot;

Lajos Kossuth, a theorist from Hungary, argues that a speech given earlier to the Ohio legislature on February 19, 1852. may have influenced Lincoln, which included the phrase, &quot;The spirit of our age is Democracy. All for the people, and all by the people. Nothing about the people without the people – That is Democracy! […]&quot;,

== Five manuscripts ==

Each of the five known manuscript copies of Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address are named for the person who received it from Lincoln. Lincoln gave copies to his private secretaries, John Nicolay and John Hay. Both of these drafts were written around the time of his November 19 address, while the other three copies of the address, the Everett, Bancroft, and Bliss copies, were written by Lincoln for charitable purposes after November 19. In part because Lincoln provided a title and signed and dated the Bliss copy, that version has become the standard text of Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address.
In 1874, Nicolay and Hay were appointed custodians of Lincoln&#x27;s papers by Robert Todd Lincoln, Lincoln&#x27;s son. After appearing in facsimile in an article written by John Nicolay in 1894, the Nicolay copy was presumably among the papers given to Hay by Nicolay&#x27;s daughter, Helen, following Nicolay&#x27;s death in 1901. In 1908, Robert Lincoln began searching for the original copy of the Gettysburg Address, leading to his discovery of a handwritten copy that was part of the bound papers of John Hay, a copy now known as the &quot;Hay copy&quot; or &quot;Hay draft&quot;.

The Hay draft differed notably from the version of the Gettysburg Address published by John Nicolay. It was written on a different type of paper, had a different number of words per line and number of lines, and included editorial revisions that were personally made by Lincoln to the speech.

Both the Hay and Nicolay copies of the Gettysburg Address are now housed at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., where they are encased in specially designed, temperature-controlled, sealed containers with argon gas designed to protect the documents from oxidation and continued deterioration.

=== Nicolay copy ===
The Nicolay copy is often called the &quot;first draft&quot; of the Gettysburg Address because it is believed to be the earliest copy that exists of it. Scholars disagree over whether the Nicolay copy was actually the copy Lincoln used at Gettysburg on November 19. In an 1894 article, which included a facsimile of the this copy, Nicolay, the custodian of Lincoln&#x27;s papers, wrote that Lincoln brought the first part of the speech written in ink on Executive Mansion stationery, and that he wrote the second page in pencil on lined paper before the ceremonial dedication on November 19. Matching folds are still evident on the two pages, suggesting that it could be the copy that eyewitnesses say Lincoln took from his coat pocket and read from at the ceremony. Others believe that the delivery text has been lost, because some of the words and phrases of the Nicolay copy do not match contemporary transcriptions of Lincoln&#x27;s original speech. The words &quot;under God&quot;, for example, are missing in this copy from the phrase &quot;that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom ...&quot; In order for the Nicolay draft to have been the reading copy, either the contemporary transcriptions were inaccurate, or Lincoln would have had to depart from his written text in several instances. This copy of the Gettysburg Address apparently remained in John Nicolay&#x27;s possession until his death in 1901, when it passed to his friend and colleague John Hay. The Nicolay version was on previously on display as part of the American Treasures exhibition at the Library of Congress.

===Hay copy===

The Hay copy of the address was first announced to the public in 1906, following a search for the original manuscript of the address. It was found among the papers of John Hay. The Hay copy differs somewhat from the manuscript of the address described by Nicolay in his article, and includes several omissions and insertions made by Lincoln, including omissions critical to the basic meaning of the sentence, not simply words that would be added by Lincoln to strengthen or clarify their meaning. In this copy of the address, like the Nicolay copy, the words &quot;under God&quot; are not present.

The Hay version has been described as &quot;the most inexplicable&quot; of the drafts and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;second draft&quot;. The Hay copy was written by Lincoln either the morning before the event, or shortly after Lincoln&#x27;s return to Washington, D.C.. Those who believe that it was completed the morning of his address point to the fact that it includes several phrases that are not present in the first draft, which do appear in media coverage of the address and in subsequent copies made by Lincoln. It is probable, they conclude, that, as the Library of Congress includes in an explanatory note accompanying the original copies of the first and second drafts, that this was the version that Lincoln read from when he delivered the address. Lincoln eventually gave this copy of the speech to Hay, whose descendants donated it and the Nicolay copy to the Library of Congress in 1916.

=== Everett copy ===
The Everett copy, also known as the &quot;Everett-Keyes copy&quot;, was given to Edward Everett by Lincoln in early 1864, after Everett requested it. Everett collected the speeches at the Gettysburg dedication into a bound volume, which was soldl for the benefit of stricken soldiers at New York&#x27;s Sanitary Commission Fair. The draft Lincoln sent Everett is known as the third autograph copy, and is now held by the Illinois State Library in Springfield, Illinois, where it is displayed in the Treasures Gallery of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum.

=== Bancroft copy ===
The Bancroft copy of the Gettysburg Address was written out by Lincoln in February 1864, following the ceremonial dedication, at the request of George Bancroft, a former Secretary of the Navy and historian whose comprehensive ten-volume &quot;History of the United States&quot; later led him to be known as the &quot;father of American History&quot;. Bancroft planned to include this copy of the Gettysburg Address in &quot;Autograph Leaves of Our Country&#x27;s Authors&quot;, which he planned to sell at a Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Sanitary Fair in Baltimore. This copy, known as the fourth copy of the address, was written by Lincoln on both sides of the paper, and it ultimately proved unusable for this purpose, and Bancroft was allowed to keep it. This manuscript is the only one version accompanied by a letter from Lincoln transmitting the manuscript and by the original envelope addressed and franked by Lincoln. The Bancroft copy was held by the Bancroft family for many years, and was later sold to various dealers and purchased by Nicholas and Marguerite Lilly Noyes, who donated it to Cornell University in 1949. The Bancroft copy is now held by the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections in the Carl A. Kroch Library at Cornell University. This is the only copy among the five that is privately owned.

=== Bliss copy ===

Discovering that his fourth written copy could not be used, Lincoln then wrote a fifth and final draft, known as the Bliss copy and named for Colonel Alexander Bliss, Bancroft&#x27;s stepson and publisher of &quot;Autograph Leaves&quot;. It is the only copy of the address that is signed by Lincoln and the final version of the address that Lincoln is known to have written. Because of the care Lincoln used in preparing the Bliss copy and because this copy includes a title and is signed and dated by Lincoln, it is considered the standard version of the Gettysburg Address and the source for most facsimile reproductions of Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address. It is the version that is inscribed on the South wall of the Lincoln Memorial.

This draft is now displayed in the Lincoln Room of the White House, a gift of Oscar B. Cintas, former Cuban Ambassador to the United States. Cintas, a wealthy collector of art and manuscripts, purchased the Bliss copy at a public auction in 1949 for $54,000 ($ as of 2025), at that time the highest price ever paid for a document at public auction. Cintas&#x27; properties were claimed by the Castro government after the Cuban Revolution in 1959. Cintas, who died in 1957, willed the Gettysburg Address to the American people, provided it would be kept at the White House, where it was transferred in 1959.

Garry Wills concluded that the Bliss copy &quot;is stylistically preferable to others in one significant way: Lincoln removed &#x27;here&#x27; from &#x27;that cause for which they (here) gave ...&#x27; The seventh &#x27;here&#x27; is in all other versions of the speech.&quot; Wills noted the fact that Lincoln &quot;was still making such improvements&quot;, suggesting Lincoln was more concerned with a perfected text than with an &quot;original&quot; one.

From November 21, 2008, to January 1, 2009, the Albert H. Small Documents Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History hosted a limited public viewing of the Bliss copy, with the support of then First Lady Laura Bush. The museum also launched an online exhibition and interactive gallery to enable visitors to look more closely at the document.

===Associated Press report===
Another contemporary source of the text is a dispatch by Joseph L. Gilbert, Associated Press, transcribed from the shorthand notes taken by reporter Joseph L. Gilbert. It also differs from the drafted text in a number of minor ways.

==Contemporary sources and reaction==
Eyewitness reports vary on Lincoln&#x27;s performance and delivery of the Gettysburg Address. In 1931, the printed recollections of 87-year-old Mrs. Sarah A. Cooke Myers, who was 19 when she attended the ceremony, suggest a dignified silence followed Lincoln&#x27;s speech. &quot;I was close to the President and heard all of the Address, but it seemed short. Then there was an impressive silence like our Menallen Friends Meeting. There was no applause when he stopped speaking.&quot; According to historian Shelby Foote, after Lincoln&#x27;s presentation, the applause was delayed, scattered, and &quot;barely polite&quot;. In contrast, Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin says, &quot;He pronounced that speech in a voice that all the multitude heard. The crowd was hushed into silence because the President stood before them ... It was so Impressive! It was the common remark of everybody. Such a speech, as they said it was!&quot;

In an often repeated legend, Lincoln is said to have turned to his bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon and remarked that his speech, like a bad plow, &quot;won&#x27;t scour&quot;. According to Garry Wills, however, this statement largely originates from Lamon&#x27;s unreliable recollections and is not an accepted fact. In Garry Wills&#x27;s view, &quot; had done what he wanted to do &quot;.

In a letter to Lincoln written the day following his address in Gettysburg, Everett praised the President for the speech, saying, &quot;I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, as you did in two minutes.&quot; Lincoln replied that he was glad to know the speech was not a &quot;total failure&quot;.

Other public reactions to the speech were divided along partisan lines. The Democratic-leaning &quot;Chicago Times&quot; observed, &quot;The cheek of every American must tingle with shame as he reads the silly, flat and dishwatery utterances of the man who has to be pointed out to intelligent foreigners as the President of the United States.&quot; The Republican-leaning &quot;The New York Times&quot;, however, was complimentary of Lincoln&#x27;s address, and printed the full text. The &quot;Springfield Republican&quot; in Springfield, Massachusetts also printed the entire speech, calling it &quot;a perfect gem&quot; that was &quot;deep in feeling, compact in thought and expression, and tasteful and elegant in every word and comma&quot;. The &quot;Republican&quot; predicted that Lincoln&#x27;s brief remarks would &quot;repay further study as the model speech&quot;.

In 2013, on the sesquicentennial of the address, &quot;The Patriot-News&quot; in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, retracted its original reporting on the address, which it described as &quot;silly remarks&quot; deserving &quot;the veil of oblivion&quot;, writing further that, &quot;Seven score and ten years ago, the forefathers of this media institution brought forth to its audience a judgment so flawed, so tainted by hubris, so lacking in the perspective history would bring, that it cannot remain unaddressed in our archives. ... the &quot;Patriot &amp; Union&quot; failed to recognize [the speech&#x27;s] momentous importance, timeless eloquence, and lasting significance. The &quot;Patriot-News&quot; regrets the error.&quot;

Foreign newspapers also reported critically on Lincoln&#x27;s address. In London, &quot;The Times&quot; reported, &quot;The ceremony [at Gettysburg] was rendered ludicrous by some of the luckless sallies of that poor President Lincoln.&quot;

Congressman Joseph A. Goulden, then an eighteen-year-old school teacher, was present and heard the speech. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps during the Civil War, and was later elected to Congress as a Democrat. Goulden was often asked about the speech, since the passage of time made him one of a dwindling number of individuals who were present for it. He responded that the event and Lincoln&#x27;s remarks were met favorably, saying that Lincoln&#x27;s address served as a factor that inspired him to enter military service. Goulden&#x27;s recollections were summarized in remarks to the House of Representatives in 1914.

=== Audio recollections ===
William R. Rathvon is the only known eyewitness of both Lincoln&#x27;s arrival at Gettysburg and the address itself to have obtained made audio recording of his recollections. One year before his death in 1939, Rathvon&#x27;s reminiscences were recorded on February 12, 1938, at WRUL in Boston, including his reading the address, and a 78 RPM record was pressed. The title of the 78 record was, &quot;I Heard Lincoln That Day – William R. Rathvon, TR Productions&quot;. A copy of it was later aired by National Public Radio (NPR) during its &quot;Quest for Sound&quot; project in 1999.

Like most people who were present that day in Gettysburg, the Rathvon family was aware that Lincoln was going to offer some remarks to the assembled crowd. The family went to the town square where the procession formed and proceeded to the cemetery, which was then still under construction. At the head of the procession, Lincoln rode on a gray horse preceded by a military band, which was the first the young boy in the Rathyon family had ever seen. Rathvon describes Lincoln as so tall and with such long legs that they went almost to the ground; he also mentions the long eloquent speech given by Edward Everett, who Rathvon described as the &quot;most finished orator of the day&quot;. Rathvon described Lincoln stepping forward &quot;with a manner serious almost to sadness, gave his brief address&quot;. During Lincoln&#x27;s delivery, the young Rathvon boy and several others wiggled their way forward through the crowd until they stood within of Lincoln, and looked up into what he described as Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;serious face&quot;. Rathvon later said that he listened &quot;intently to every word the president uttered and heard it clearly&quot;, but &quot;boylike, I could not recall any of it afterwards&quot;. However, he said, that anyone who said anything disparaging about &quot;honest Abe&quot;, would have been a &quot;junior battle of Gettysburg&quot;. In the recording, Rathvon speaks of Lincoln&#x27;s speech as &quot;echoing through the hills&quot;.

===Photographs===

The only known and confirmed photograph of Lincoln at Gettysburg, was taken by photographer David Bachrach. Lincoln&#x27;s presence in the photo was identified in 1952 by Josephine Cobb, an archivist who enlarged a mislabeled glass plate negative, which revealed Lincoln&#x27;s presence in the photo that was then on display at Mathew Brady&#x27;s collection of photographic plates at the National Archives and Records Administration.

While Lincoln&#x27;s speech was short and may have precluded multiple pictures of him while speaking, he and the other dignitaries sat for hours during the rest of the program. A popular explanation for the Bachrach photo suggests that Lincoln&#x27;s brief address, which followed a lengthy two hour speech by Everett, caught photographers by surprise. As a result, they supposedly were able to only take a photo of Lincoln after his speech had ended. This theory, however, has been questioned, since evidence exists suggesting that the photo was possibly taken before the Gettysburg Address and without any intention of photographing Lincoln from such a lengthy distance.

=== Usage of &quot;under God&quot; ===
The exact phrase &quot;under God&quot; does not appear in the Nicolay and Hay drafts. But it does appear in the three later copies held by Everett, Bancroft, and Bliss. This has led some skeptics to question whether the words &quot;under God&quot; were included in the remarks Lincoln gave that day. However, at least three reporters telegraphed the text of Lincoln&#x27;s speech on the day the Address was given with the words &quot;under God&quot; included. Historian William E. Barton argues that:

Reporters present for Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address included Joseph Gilbert with the Associated Press, Charles Hale with the &quot;Boston Daily Advertiser&quot;, John R. Young with the &quot;Philadelphia Press&quot;, and reporters from the &quot;Cincinnati Commercial&quot; &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Hale, according to later reports, arrived at the event, and &quot;had notebook and pencil in hand, [and] took down the slow-spoken words of the President&quot;. &quot;He took down what he declared was the exact language of Lincoln&#x27;s address, and his declaration was as good as the oath of a court stenographer. His associates confirmed his testimony, which was received, as it deserved to be, at its face value.&quot; One explanation is that Lincoln deviated from his prepared text and inserted the phrase when he spoke. Ronald C. White, visiting professor of history at the University of California, Los Angeles and professor of American religious history emeritus at San Francisco Theological Seminary, wrote:

It was an uncharacteristically spontaneous revision for a speaker who did not trust extemporaneous speech. Lincoln had added impromptu words in several earlier speeches, but always offered a subsequent apology for the change. In this instance, he did not. And Lincoln included &quot;under God&quot; in all three copies of the address he prepared at later dates. &quot;Under God&quot; pointed backward and forward: back to &quot;this nation&quot;, which drew its breath from both political and religious sources, but also forward to a &quot;new birth&quot;. Lincoln had come to see the Civil War as a ritual of purification. The old Union had to die. The old man had to die. Death became a transition to a new Union and a new humanity.

Prior to 1860, the phrase &quot;under God&quot; was used frequently, usually meaning &quot;with God&#x27;s help&quot;.

==Platform location==
Outside of both entrances to present-day Gettysburg National Cemetery, there are two historical markers, which read:

Nearby, Nov. 19, 1863, in dedicating the National Cemetery, Abraham Lincoln gave the address which he had written in Washington and revised after his arrival at Gettysburg the evening of November 18.

Directly inside the Taneytown Road entrance are the Lincoln Address Memorial and Gettysburg Rostrum, where five U.S. Presidents have spoken. Lincoln, however, was not one of them, and a small metal sign near the speech memorial stirs remains somewhat controversial, reading:

The Address was delivered about 300 yards from this spot along the upper Cemetery drive. The site is now marked by the Soldiers&#x27; National Monument.

Holding title as the &quot;traditional site&quot;, the Soldiers&#x27; National Monument has been challenged by platform occupants in the distant past and by more recent photographic analyses. Based upon a pair of photographic analyses, the Gettysburg National Military Park has placed a marker near 39°49.199′N 77°13.840′W, which states, &quot;The location [of the platform] was never marked, but is believed to be in Evergreen Cemetery, on the other side of the iron fence.&quot;

This newer marker stands faces the fence, which separates the two adjacent cemeteries, the public Gettysburg National Cemetery and private Evergreen Cemetery. A second endorsement of this as the &quot;traditional site,&quot; a bronze marker placed by Lincoln&#x27;s native Kentucky section of the cemetery is nearby.

Absent an original and enduring marker, however, the location of the platform has largely been left up to interpretation. Brian Kennell, superintendent of Evergreen Cemetery, endorses the location identified in the photographic evidence as the location where Lincoln stood as he delivered the Gettysburg Address.

===Pre-modern===

Colonel W. Yates Selleck, a marshal in the parade on Consecration Day, was seated on the platform when Lincoln gave the address. Selleck marked a map with the position of the platform and described it as &quot; almost due north of Soldiers&#x27; National Monument, from a point in the outer circle of lots where [the] Michigan and New York [burial sections] are separated by a path&quot;. A location which approximates this description is 39°49.243′N, 77°13.869′W.

In 1973, retired park historian Frederick Tilberg concluded the Selleck Site is lower than the crest of Cemetery Hill, and that only the crest presents a panoramic view of the battlefield. A spectacular view from the location of the speech was noted by many eyewitnesses, is consistent with the traditional site at the Soldiers&#x27; National Monument and other sites on the crest, but is inconsistent with the Selleck Site.

The Kentucky Memorial, erected in 1975, is directly adjacent to the Soldiers&#x27; National Monument, and states, &quot;Kentucky honors her son, Abraham Lincoln, who delivered his immortal address at the site now marked by the soldiers&#x27; monument.&quot; With its position at the center of the concentric rings of soldiers&#x27; graves and the continuing endorsement of Lincoln&#x27;s native state the Soldiers&#x27; National Monument persists as a credible location for the speech.

In November 1863, in a written description of the layout for the Gettysburg National Cemetery, which was then under construction, a correspondent from the &quot;Cincinnati Daily Commercial&quot; described the dividing lines between the state grave plots as &quot;the radii of a common center, where a flag pole is now raised, but where it is proposed to erect a national monument&quot;. With the inclusion of this quotation Tilberg inadvertently verifies a central principle of future photographic analyses—a flagpole, rather than the speakers&#x27; platform, occupied the central point of the soldiers&#x27; graves. In fact, the precision of the photo-analyses relies upon the coincidence of position between this temporary flag pole and the future monument.

Confusing to today&#x27;s tourist, the Kentucky Memorial is contradicted by a newer marker, which was erected nearby by the Gettysburg National Military Park and locates the speakers&#x27; platform inside Evergreen Cemetery. Similarly, outdated National Park Service documents, which pinpoint the location as being at Soldiers&#x27; National Monument, have not been systematically revised since the placement of the newer marker. Miscellaneous web pages perpetuate the &quot;Traditional Site.&quot;

===Photo analysis===
====2D and optical stereoscopy====

In 1982, Senior Park Historian Kathleen Georg Harrison analyzed photographs and proposed the location in Evergreen Cemetery, but she has not published her analysis. Speaking for Harrison without revealing details, two sources characterized her proposed location as &quot;on or near [the] Brown family vault&quot; in Evergreen Cemetery.

In 1995, William A. Frassanito, a former military intelligence analyst, documented a comprehensive photographic analysis, which places the location of the platform with the position of specific modern headstones in Evergreen Cemetery. According to Frassanito, the extant graves of Israel Yount (died 1892)(), John Koch (died 1913)(), and George E. Kitzmiller (died 1874)() are among those which occupy the location of the 1863 speaker&#x27;s stand.

====3D photo-rendering and -animation====
Over a course of many years, Christopher Oakley, an assistant professor of new media at the University of North Carolina at Asheville and his students have labored to produce and relentlessly perfect &quot;a lifelike virtual 3-D re-creation of Lincoln delivering the Gettysburg Address&quot; as part of the Virtual Lincoln Project. One result concluded, “Placing the Platform: Using 3D Technology to Pinpoint Lincoln at Gettysburg” was presented on November 18, 2022, at the Lincoln Forum XXVII in Gettysburg.

As a starting point, the project modeled the topography around Cemetery Hill, the Gatehouse at Evergreen Cemetery, and the documented positions of nonextant objects, which appear in photographs, including the poplar tree, the flag pole, and the Duttera House among them, using 3-D animation software Maya. The platform and its occupants also were modeled. The approximate positions of the cameras were placed into the 3-D environment, and the overall model was iteratively refined. By reproducing the appearance of the four known photographs, taken distantly from one another in 1863, Lincoln and the platform have been placed in virtual reality.

Oakley&#x27;s model shows the platform straddling the iron fence between the Soldiers&#x27; National Cemetery and Evergreen Cemetery. It increases the size of the platform and changes its shape from rectangular, as previous researchers have maintained, to trapezoidal. The speaker&#x27;s position occupies a portion of the platform over the grounds of the Soldiers&#x27; National Cemetery.

William Frassanito&#x27;s analysis is based on two of the four photographic perspectives, which were employed by Oakley to validate his 3D model. Frassanito assesses one of his sources, saying, &quot;This view [by Weaver] was probably not taken from the second-story window of the gatehouse itself.&quot; Via enlargement of a Gardner photograph (taken from the opposite direction), John J. Richter may have identified a photographer with a camera in this exact window, thereby weakening the contribution of the Weaver photograph to Frassanito&#x27;s conclusions. Oakley&#x27;s proprietary 3D model utilizes the position of Weaver&#x27;s camera as suggested by Richter.

===Resolution===

The Gettysburg National Military Park marker, consistent with the findings of various historians, identifies the private Evergreen Cemetery, rather than public Soldiers&#x27; National Cemetery, as the exact location where Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address. The National Park Service, in its description of Gettysburg National Cemetery, also identifies this as the location where Lincoln spoke that day:
The Soldiers&#x27; National Monument, long misidentified as the spot from which Lincoln spoke, honors the fallen soldiers. [The location of the speech] was actually on the crown of this hill, a short distance on the other side of the iron fence and inside the Evergreen Cemetery, where President Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address to a crowd of some 15,000 people.

Although Lincoln dedicated the Gettysburg National Cemetery, the monument at the center of the cemetery is unrelated to Lincoln or his famous speech. Intended to symbolize Columbia paying tribute to her fallen sons, its appreciation has been commandeered by the thirst for a tidy home for the speech. Freeing the Cemetery and Monument to serve their original purpose, honoring of Union departed, is as unlikely as a resolution to the location controversy and the erection of a public monument to the speech in the exclusively private Evergreen Cemetery.

== Legacy ==
The importance of the Gettysburg Address in the history of the United States is underscored by its enduring presence in American culture. In addition to its prominent place carved into a stone cella on the south wall of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the Gettysburg Address is frequently referenced in popular culture, with the implicit expectation that contemporary audiences are already familiar with the words Lincoln used .

In the many generations that have passed since the address, it has remained among the most famous speeches in American history and is often taught in classes about history or civics. Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address is referenced in another famed oration, Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. Standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in August 1963, King began with a reference, by the style of his opening phrase, to President Lincoln and his enduring words: &quot;Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice.&quot;

Phrases from the Gettysburg Address are often used or referenced in other works. The current Constitution of France states that the principle of the French Republic is &quot;&quot;gouvernement du peuple, par le peuple et pour le peuple&quot; (&quot;government of the people, by the people, and for the people&quot;), a literal translation of Lincoln&#x27;s words. Sun Yat-Sen&#x27;s &quot;Three Principles of the People&quot; as well as the preamble for the 1947 Constitution of Japan were also inspired from that phrase. The aircraft carrier has as its ship&#x27;s motto the phrase &quot;shall not perish&quot;.

Following Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, Charles Sumner, a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts from 1851 to 1874, described the enduring significance of the Gettysburg Address, saying, &quot;That speech, uttered at the field of Gettysburg ... and now sanctified by the martyrdom of its author,&quot; is a monumental act. In the modesty of his nature, he said, &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here; but it can never forget what they did here.&#x27; He was mistaken. The world at once noted what he said, and will never cease to remember it.&quot;

In January 1961, then U.S. president John F. Kennedy tasked his speechwriter Ted Sorensen with studying the Gettysburg Address in an effort to assist Sorensen in authoring Kennedy&#x27;s inaugural address. Sorensen drew many lessons from the Gettysburg Address, which according to Sorensen included rhetoric devices used by many speechwriters like alliterations, rhymes, repetitions, contrast, and balance.

In July 1963, Kennedy referenced the Battle of Gettysburg and Gettysburg Address during his own speech in Gettysburg, saying, &quot;Five score years ago, the ground on which we here stand shuddered under the clash of arms and was consecrated for all time by the blood of American manhood. Abraham Lincoln, in dedicating this great battlefield, has expressed, in words too eloquent for paraphrase or summary, why this sacrifice was necessary.&quot;

In 2015, the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation compiled &quot;Gettysburg Replies: The World Responds to Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address&quot;, a book that challenges leaders to craft 272-word responses celebrating Lincoln, the Gettysburg Address, or a related topic. One reply by Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist, described Lincoln&#x27;s greatest legacy as establishing, the same year of the Gettysburg Address, the National Academy of Sciences, which had the longterm effect of &quot;setting our Nation on a course of scientifically enlightened governance, without which we all may perish from this Earth&quot;.

===Envelope and other myths===
One myth about the Gettysburg Address is that Lincoln quickly authored the speech on the back of an envelope while on the train en route from Washington, D.C, to Gettysburg the day before the address. This widely held misunderstanding may have originated with &quot;The Perfect Tribute&quot;, a 1906 book by Mary Raymond Shipman Andrews, which was assigned reading for generations of schoolchildren, sold 600,000 copies when published as a standalone volume, and was twice adapted into a movie.

Other lesser known claims include Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s inaccurate assertion that Lincoln composed the address &quot;in only a few moments&quot;, and statements by industrialist Andrew Carnegie, who wrongly said he personally supplied Lincoln with the pen with which he authored the address.

==Popular culture==

&quot;Lincoln Portrait&quot;, a classical orchestral work written by American composer Aaron Copland, features closing phrases of the Gettysburg Address, which lead to the orchestral closing crescendo. The work involves a full orchestra, and utilizes a brass section at climactic moments. The work features a narrated reading of excerpts of Lincoln&#x27;s great documents, including the Gettysburg Address. The intoned reading from the Address uses only the last two sentences starting with the words, &quot;That from these honored dead ...&quot;.
