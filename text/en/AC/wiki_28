<text>Fluorescence is one of two kinds of photoluminescence, the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation. When exposed to ultraviolet radiation, many substances will glow (fluoresce) with colored visible light. The color of the light emitted depends on the chemical composition of the substance. Fluorescent materials generally cease to glow nearly immediately when the radiation source stops. This distinguishes them from the other type of light emission, phosphorescence. Phosphorescent materials continue to emit light for some time after the radiation stops.
This difference in timing is a result of quantum spin effects.

Fluorescence occurs when a photon of the incoming radiation is absorbed by a molecule exciting it to a higher energy level followed by emission of light as the molecule returns to a lower energy state. The emitted light may have a longer wavelength, and therefore a lower photon energy, than the absorbed radiation. For example when the absorbed radiation could be in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum (invisible to the human eye), while the emitted light is in the visible region. This gives the fluorescent substance a distinct color that is best seen when it has been exposed to UV light, making it appear to glow in the dark. However, any light of a shorter wavelength may cause a material to fluoresce at a longer wavelength. Fluorescent materials may also be excited by certain wavelengths of visible light, which masks the glow, yet their colors may appear bright and intensified. Other fluorescent materials emit their light in the infrared or even the ultraviolet regions of the spectrum.

Fluorescence has many practical applications, including mineralogy, gemology, medicine, chemical sensors (fluorescence spectroscopy), fluorescent labelling, dyes, biological detectors, cosmic-ray detection, vacuum fluorescent displays, and cathode-ray tubes. Its most common everyday application is in (gas-discharge) fluorescent lamps and LED lamps, in which fluorescent coatings convert UV or blue light into longer-wavelengths resulting in white light which can even appear indistinguishable from that of the traditional but energy-inefficient incandescent lamp. Fluorescence also occurs frequently in nature in some minerals and in many biological forms across all kingdoms of life. The latter may be referred to as &quot;biofluorescence&quot;, indicating that the fluorophore is part of or is extracted from a living organism (rather than an inorganic dye or stain). But since fluorescence is due to a specific chemical, which can also be synthesized artificially in most cases, it is sufficient to describe the substance itself as &quot;fluorescent&quot;.

==History==
Fluorescence was observed long before it was named and understood.
An early observation of fluorescence was known to the Aztecs and described in 1560 by Bernardino de Sahagún and in 1565 by Nicolás Monardes in the infusion known as &quot;lignum nephriticum&quot; (Latin for &quot;kidney wood&quot;). It was derived from the wood of two tree species, &quot;Pterocarpus indicus&quot; and &quot;Eysenhardtia polystachya&quot;.
The chemical compound responsible for this fluorescence is matlaline, which is the oxidation product of one of the flavonoids found in this wood.

In 1819, E.D. Clarke
and in 1822 René Just Haüy

described some varieties of fluorites that had a different color depending on whether the light was reflected or (apparently) transmitted. Haüy incorrectly viewed the effect as light scattering similar to opalescence. In 1833 Sir David Brewster described a similar effect in chlorophyll which he also considered a form of opalescence.
Sir John Herschel studied quinine in 1845 and came to a different incorrect conclusion.

In 1842, A.E. Becquerel observed that calcium sulfide emits light after being exposed to solar ultraviolet, making him the first to state that the emitted light is of longer wavelength than the incident light. While his observation of photoluminescence was similar to that described 10 years later by Stokes, who observed a fluorescence of a solution of quinine, the phenomenon that Becquerel described with calcium sulfide is now called phosphorescence.

In his 1852 paper on the &quot;Refrangibility&quot; (wavelength change) of light, George Gabriel Stokes described the ability of fluorspar, uranium glass and many other substances to change invisible light beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum into visible light. He named this phenomenon &quot;fluorescence&quot;
: &quot;I am almost inclined to coin a word, and call the appearance &quot;fluorescence&quot;, from fluor-spar [i.e., fluorite], as the analogous term &quot;opalescence&quot; is derived from the name of a mineral.&quot;

Neither Becquerel nor Stokes understood one key aspect of photoluminescence: the critical difference from incandescence, the emission of light by heated material. To distinguish it from incandescence, in the late 1800s, Gustav Wiedemann proposed the term luminescence to designate any emission of light more intense than expected from the source&#x27;s temperature.

Advances in spectroscopy and quantum electronics between the 1950s and 1970s provided a way to distinguish between the three different mechanisms that produce the light, as well as narrowing down the typical timescales those mechanisms take to decay after absorption. In modern science, this distinction became important because some items, such as lasers, required the fastest decay times, which typically occur in the nanosecond (billionth of a second) range. In physics, this first mechanism was termed &quot;fluorescence&quot; or &quot;singlet emission&quot;, and is common in many laser mediums such as ruby. Other fluorescent materials were discovered to have much longer decay times, because some of the atoms would change their spin to a triplet state, thus would glow brightly with fluorescence under excitation but produce a dimmer afterglow for a short time after the excitation was removed, which became labeled &quot;phosphorescence&quot; or &quot;triplet phosphorescence&quot;. The typical decay times ranged from a few microseconds to one second, which are still fast enough by human-eye standards to be colloquially referred to as fluorescent. Common examples include fluorescent lamps, organic dyes, and even fluorspar. Longer emitters, commonly referred to as glow-in-the-dark substances, ranged from one second to many hours, and this mechanism was called persistent phosphorescence or persistent luminescence, to distinguish it from the other two mechanisms.

== Physical principles ==
=== Mechanism ===

Fluorescence occurs when an excited molecule, atom, or nanostructure, relaxes to a lower energy state (usually the ground state) through emission of a photon without a change in electron spin. When the initial and final states have different multiplicity (spin), the phenomenon is termed phosphorescence.

When a molecule in its ground state (called S0) is photoexcited it may end up in any one of a number of excited states (S1, S2, S3...). These higher excited states are different vibrational levels, populated in proportion to their overlap with the ground state according to the Franck-Condon principle. These vibrational excited states typically decay rapidly by to S1, followed by radiative transition to the ground state or to vibrational states close to the ground state. This transition is called fluorescence. All of these states are singlet states.

A different pathway for deexcitation is intersystem crossing from the S1 to a triplet state T1. Decay from T1 to S0 is typically slower and less intense and is called phosphorescence.

Absorption of a photon of energy formula_1 results in an excited state of the same multiplicity (spin) of the ground state, usually a singlet (Sn with n &gt; 0). In solution, states with n &gt; 1 relax rapidly to the lowest vibrational level of the first excited state (S1) by transferring energy to the solvent molecules through non-radiative processes, including internal conversion followed by vibrational relaxation, in which the energy is dissipated as heat. Thus the fluorescence energy is typically less than the photoexcitation energy.

The excited state S1 can relax by other mechanisms that do not involve the emission of light. These processes, called non-radiative processes, compete with fluorescence emission and decrease its efficiency. Examples include internal conversion, intersystem crossing to the triplet state, and energy transfer to another molecule. An example of energy transfer is Förster resonance energy transfer. Relaxation from an excited state can also occur through collisional quenching, a process where a molecule (the quencher) collides with the fluorescent molecule during its excited state lifetime. Molecular oxygen (O2) is an extremely efficient quencher of fluorescence because of its unusual triplet ground state.

=== Quantum yield ===
The fluorescence quantum yield gives the efficiency of the fluorescence process. It is defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed.
: formula_2

The maximum possible fluorescence quantum yield is 1.0 (100%); each photon absorbed results in a photon emitted. Compounds with quantum yields of 0.10 are still considered quite fluorescent. Another way to define the quantum yield of fluorescence is by the rate of excited state decay:
: formula_3
where formula_4 is the rate constant of spontaneous emission of radiation and
: formula_5
is the sum of all rates of excited state decay. Other rates of excited state decay are caused by mechanisms other than photon emission and are, therefore, often called &quot;non-radiative rates&quot;, which can include:
* dynamic collisional quenching
* near-field dipole–dipole interaction (or resonance energy transfer)
* internal conversion
* intersystem crossing

Thus, if the rate of any pathway changes, both the excited state lifetime and the fluorescence quantum yield will be affected.

Fluorescence quantum yields are measured by comparison to a standard. The quinine salt &quot;quinine sulfate&quot; in a sulfuric acid solution was regarded as the most common fluorescence standard,
however, a recent study revealed that the fluorescence quantum yield of this solution is strongly affected by the temperature, and should no longer be used as the standard solution. The quinine in 0.1 M perchloric acid () shows no temperature dependence up to 45 °C, therefore it can be considered as a reliable standard solution.

=== Lifetime ===
The fluorescence lifetime refers to the average time the molecule stays in its excited state before emitting a photon. Fluorescence typically follows first-order kinetics:
: formula_6
where formula_7 is the concentration of excited state molecules at time formula_8, formula_9 is the initial concentration and formula_10 is the decay rate or the inverse of the fluorescence lifetime. This is an instance of exponential decay. Various radiative and non-radiative processes can de-populate the excited state. In such case the total decay rate is the sum over all rates:
: formula_11
where formula_12 is the total decay rate, formula_13 the radiative decay rate and formula_14 the non-radiative decay rate. It is similar to a first-order chemical reaction in which the first-order rate constant is the sum of all of the rates (a parallel kinetic model). If the rate of spontaneous emission, or any of the other rates are fast, the lifetime is short. For commonly used fluorescent compounds, typical excited state decay times for photon emissions with energies from the UV to near infrared are within the range of 0.5 to 20 nanoseconds. The fluorescence lifetime is an important parameter for practical applications of fluorescence such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy.

=== Jablonski diagram ===
The Jablonski diagram describes most of the relaxation mechanisms for excited state molecules. The diagram alongside shows how fluorescence occurs due to the relaxation of certain excited electrons of a molecule.

=== Fluorescence anisotropy ===
Fluorophores are more likely to be excited by photons if the transition moment of the fluorophore is parallel to the electric vector of the photon. The polarization of the emitted light will also depend on the transition moment. The transition moment is dependent on the physical orientation of the fluorophore molecule. For fluorophores in solution, the intensity and polarization of the emitted light is dependent on rotational diffusion. Therefore, anisotropy measurements can be used to investigate how freely a fluorescent molecule moves in a particular environment.

Fluorescence anisotropy can be defined quantitatively as
: formula_15
where formula_16 is the emitted intensity parallel to the polarization of the excitation light and formula_17 is the emitted intensity perpendicular to the polarization of the excitation light.

Anisotropy is independent of the intensity of the absorbed or emitted light, it is the property of the light, so photobleaching of the dye will not affect the anisotropy value as long as the signal is detectable.

=== Fluorescence ===

Strongly fluorescent pigments often have an unusual appearance which is often described colloquially as a &quot;neon color&quot; (originally &quot;day-glo&quot; in the late 1960s, early 1970s). This phenomenon was termed &quot;Farbenglut&quot; by Hermann von Helmholtz and &quot;fluorence&quot; by Ralph M. Evans. It is generally thought to be related to the high brightness of the color relative to what it would be as a component of white. Fluorescence shifts energy in the incident illumination from shorter wavelengths to longer (such as blue to yellow) and thus can make the fluorescent color appear brighter (more saturated) than it could possibly be by reflection alone.

== Rules ==
There are several general rules that deal with fluorescence. Each of the following rules have exceptions but they are useful guidelines for understanding fluorescence (these rules do not necessarily apply to two-photon absorption).

=== Kasha&#x27;s rule ===
Kasha&#x27;s rule states that the luminesce (fluorescence or phosphorescence) of a molecule will be emitted only from the lowest excited state of its given multiplicity. Vavilov&#x27;s rule (a logical extension of Kasha&#x27;s rule thusly called Kasha–Vavilov rule) dictates that the quantum yield of luminescence is independent of the wavelength of exciting radiation and is proportional to the absorbance of the excited wavelength. Kasha&#x27;s rule does not always apply and is violated by simple molecules, such an example is azulene. A somewhat more reliable statement, although still with exceptions, would be that the fluorescence spectrum shows very little dependence on the wavelength of exciting radiation.

=== Mirror image rule ===

For many fluorophores the absorption spectrum is a mirror image of the emission spectrum.
This is known as the mirror image rule and is related to the Franck–Condon principle which states that electronic transitions are vertical, that is energy changes without distance changing as can be represented with a vertical line in Jablonski diagram. This means the nucleus does not move and the vibration levels of the excited state resemble the vibration levels of the ground state.

=== Stokes shift ===

In general, emitted fluorescence light has a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed light. This phenomenon, known as Stokes shift, is due to energy loss between the time a photon is absorbed and when a new one is emitted. The causes and magnitude of Stokes shift can be complex and are dependent on the fluorophore and its environment. However, there are some common causes. It is frequently due to non-radiative decay to the lowest vibrational energy level of the excited state. Another factor is that the emission of fluorescence frequently leaves a fluorophore in a higher vibrational level of the ground state.

== In nature ==
There are many natural compounds that exhibit fluorescence, and they have a number of applications. Some deep-sea animals, such as the greeneye, have fluorescent structures.

=== Compared to bioluminescence and biophosphorescence ===
==== Fluorescence ====
Fluorescence is the phenomenon of absorption of electromagnetic radiation, typically from ultraviolet or visible light, by a molecule and the subsequent emission of a photon of a lower energy (smaller frequency, longer wavelength). This causes the light that is emitted to be a different color than the light that is absorbed. Stimulating light excites an electron to an excited state. When the molecule returns to the ground state, it releases a photon, which is the fluorescent emission. The excited state lifetime is short, so emission of light is typically only observable when the absorbing light is on. Fluorescence can be of any wavelength but is often more significant when emitted photons are in the visible spectrum. When it occurs in a living organism, it is sometimes called biofluorescence. Fluorescence should not be confused with bioluminescence and biophosphorescence. Pumpkin toadlets that live in the Brazilian Atlantic forest are fluorescent.

==== Bioluminescence ====
Bioluminescence differs from fluorescence in that it is the natural production of light by chemical reactions within an organism, whereas fluorescence is the absorption and reemission of light from the environment. Fireflies and anglerfish are two examples of bioluminescent organisms. To add to the potential confusion, some organisms are both bioluminescent and fluorescent, like the sea pansy Renilla reniformis, where bioluminescence serves as the light source for fluorescence.

==== Phosphorescence ====
Phosphorescence is similar to fluorescence in its requirement of light wavelengths as a provider of excitation energy. The difference here lies in the relative stability of the energized electron. Unlike with fluorescence, in phosphorescence the electron retains stability, emitting light that continues to &quot;glow in the dark&quot; even after the stimulating light source has been removed. For example, glow-in-the-dark stickers are phosphorescent, but there are no truly &quot;biophosphorescent&quot; animals known.

=== Mechanisms ===
==== Epidermal chromatophores ====
Pigment cells that exhibit fluorescence are called fluorescent chromatophores, and function somatically similar to regular chromatophores. These cells are dendritic, and contain pigments called fluorosomes. These pigments contain fluorescent proteins which are activated by K+ (potassium) ions, and it is their movement, aggregation, and dispersion within the fluorescent chromatophore that cause directed fluorescence patterning. Fluorescent cells are innervated the same as other chromatophores, like melanophores, pigment cells that contain melanin. Short term fluorescent patterning and signaling is controlled by the nervous system. Fluorescent chromatophores can be found in the skin (e.g. in fish) just below the epidermis, amongst other chromatophores.

Epidermal fluorescent cells in fish also respond to hormonal stimuli by the α–MSH and MCH hormones much the same as melanophores. This suggests that fluorescent cells may have color changes throughout the day that coincide with their circadian rhythm. Fish may also be sensitive to cortisol induced stress responses to environmental stimuli, such as interaction with a predator or engaging in a mating ritual.

=== Phylogenetics ===
==== Evolutionary origins ====
The incidence of fluorescence across the tree of life is widespread, and has been studied most extensively in cnidarians and fish. The phenomenon appears to have evolved multiple times in multiple taxa such as in the anguilliformes (eels), gobioidei (gobies and cardinalfishes), and tetradontiformes (triggerfishes), along with the other taxa discussed later in the article. Fluorescence is highly genotypically and phenotypically variable even within ecosystems, in regards to the wavelengths emitted, the patterns displayed, and the intensity of the fluorescence. Generally, the species relying upon camouflage exhibit the greatest diversity in fluorescence, likely because camouflage may be one of the uses of fluorescence.

It is suspected by some scientists that GFPs and GFP-like proteins began as electron donors activated by light. These electrons were then used for reactions requiring light energy. Functions of fluorescent proteins, such as protection from the sun, conversion of light into different wavelengths, or for signaling are thought to have evolved secondarily.

==== Adaptive functions ====
Currently, relatively little is known about the functional significance of fluorescence and fluorescent proteins. However, it is suspected that fluorescence may serve important functions in signaling and communication, mating, lures, camouflage, UV protection and antioxidation, photoacclimation, dinoflagellate regulation, and in coral health.

=== Aquatic ===
Water absorbs light of long wavelengths, so less light from these wavelengths reflects back to reach the eye. Therefore, warm colors from the visual light spectrum appear less vibrant at increasing depths. Water scatters light of shorter wavelengths above violet, meaning cooler colors dominate the visual field in the photic zone. Light intensity decreases 10 fold with every 75 m of depth, so at depths of 75 m, light is 10% as intense as it is on the surface, and is only 1% as intense at 150 m as it is on the surface. Because the water filters out the wavelengths and intensity of water reaching certain depths, different proteins, because of the wavelengths and intensities of light they are capable of absorbing, are better suited to different depths. Theoretically, some fish eyes can detect light as deep as 1000 m. At these depths of the aphotic zone, the only sources of light are organisms themselves, giving off light through chemical reactions in a process called bioluminescence.

Fluorescence is simply defined as the absorption of electromagnetic radiation at one wavelength and its reemission at another, lower energy wavelength. Thus any type of fluorescence depends on the presence of external sources of light. Biologically functional fluorescence is found in the photic zone, where there is not only enough light to cause fluorescence, but enough light for other organisms to detect it.
The visual field in the photic zone is naturally blue, so colors of fluorescence can be detected as bright reds, oranges, yellows, and greens. Green is the most commonly found color in the marine spectrum, yellow the second most, orange the third, and red is the rarest. Fluorescence can occur in organisms in the aphotic zone as a byproduct of that same organism&#x27;s bioluminescence. Some fluorescence in the aphotic zone is merely a byproduct of the organism&#x27;s tissue biochemistry and does not have a functional purpose. However, some cases of functional and adaptive significance of fluorescence in the aphotic zone of the deep ocean is an active area of research.

==== Photic zone ====
===== Fish =====

Bony fishes living in shallow water generally have good color vision due to their living in a colorful environment. Thus, in shallow-water fishes, red, orange, and green fluorescence most likely serves as a means of communication with conspecifics, especially given the great phenotypic variance of the phenomenon.

Many fish that exhibit fluorescence, such as sharks, lizardfish, scorpionfish, wrasses, and flatfishes, also possess yellow intraocular filters. Yellow intraocular filters in the lenses and cornea of certain fishes function as long-pass filters. These filters enable the species to visualize and potentially exploit fluorescence, in order to enhance visual contrast and patterns that are unseen to other fishes and predators that lack this visual specialization. Fish that possess the necessary yellow intraocular filters for visualizing fluorescence potentially exploit a light signal from members of it. Fluorescent patterning was especially prominent in cryptically patterned fishes possessing complex camouflage. Many of these lineages also possess yellow long-pass intraocular filters that could enable visualization of such patterns.

Another adaptive use of fluorescence is to generate orange and red light from the ambient blue light of the photic zone to aid vision. Red light can only be seen across short distances due to attenuation of red light wavelengths by water. Many fish species that fluoresce are small, group-living, or benthic/aphotic, and have conspicuous patterning. This patterning is caused by fluorescent tissue and is visible to other members of the species, however the patterning is invisible at other visual spectra. These intraspecific fluorescent patterns also coincide with intra-species signaling. The patterns present in ocular rings to indicate directionality of an individual&#x27;s gaze, and along fins to indicate directionality of an individual&#x27;s movement. Current research suspects that this red fluorescence is used for private communication between members of the same species. Due to the prominence of blue light at ocean depths, red light and light of longer wavelengths are muddled, and many predatory reef fish have little to no sensitivity for light at these wavelengths. Fish such as the fairy wrasse that have developed visual sensitivity to longer wavelengths are able to display red fluorescent signals that give a high contrast to the blue environment and are conspicuous to conspecifics in short ranges, yet are relatively invisible to other common fish that have reduced sensitivities to long wavelengths. Thus, fluorescence can be used as adaptive signaling and intra-species communication in reef fish.

Additionally, it is suggested that fluorescent tissues that surround an organism&#x27;s eyes are used to convert blue light from the photic zone or green bioluminescence in the aphotic zone into red light to aid vision.

===== Sharks =====
A new fluorophore was described in two species of sharks, wherein it was due to an undescribed group of brominated tryptophane-kynurenine small molecule metabolites.

===== Coral =====
Fluorescence serves a wide variety of functions in coral. Fluorescent proteins in corals may contribute to photosynthesis by converting otherwise unusable wavelengths of light into ones for which the coral&#x27;s symbiotic algae are able to conduct photosynthesis. Also, the proteins may fluctuate in number as more or less light becomes available as a means of photoacclimation. Similarly, these fluorescent proteins may possess antioxidant capacities to eliminate oxygen radicals produced by photosynthesis. Finally, through modulating photosynthesis, the fluorescent proteins may also serve as a means of regulating the activity of the coral&#x27;s photosynthetic algal symbionts.

===== Cephalopods =====

&quot;Alloteuthis subulata&quot; and &quot;Loligo vulgaris&quot;, two types of nearly transparent squid, have fluorescent spots above their eyes. These spots reflect incident light, which may serve as a means of camouflage, but also for signaling to other squids for schooling purposes.

===== Jellyfish =====

Another, well-studied example of fluorescence in the ocean is the hydrozoan &quot;Aequorea victoria&quot;. This jellyfish lives in the photic zone off the west coast of North America and was identified as a carrier of green fluorescent protein (GFP) by Osamu Shimomura. The gene for these green fluorescent proteins has been isolated and is scientifically significant because it is widely used in genetic studies to indicate the expression of other genes.

===== Mantis shrimp =====
Several species of mantis shrimp, which are stomatopod crustaceans, including &quot;Lysiosquillina glabriuscula&quot;, have yellow fluorescent markings along their antennal scales and carapace (shell) that males present during threat displays to predators and other males. The display involves raising the head and thorax, spreading the striking appendages and other maxillipeds, and extending the prominent, oval antennal scales laterally, which makes the animal appear larger and accentuates its yellow fluorescent markings. Furthermore, as depth increases, mantis shrimp fluorescence accounts for a greater part of the visible light available. During mating rituals, mantis shrimp actively fluoresce, and the wavelength of this fluorescence matches the wavelengths detected by their eye pigments.

==== Aphotic zone ====
===== Siphonophores =====
&quot;Siphonophorae&quot; is an order of marine animals from the phylum Hydrozoa that consist of a specialized medusoid and polyp zooid. Some siphonophores, including the genus Erenna that live in the aphotic zone between depths of 1600 m and 2300 m, exhibit yellow to red fluorescence in the photophores of their tentacle-like tentilla. This fluorescence occurs as a by-product of bioluminescence from these same photophores. The siphonophores exhibit the fluorescence in a flicking pattern that is used as a lure to attract prey.

===== Dragonfish =====
The predatory deep-sea dragonfish &quot;Malacosteus niger&quot;, the closely related genus &quot;Aristostomias&quot; and the species &quot;Pachystomias microdon&quot; use fluorescent red accessory pigments to convert the blue light emitted from their own bioluminescence to red light from suborbital photophores. This red luminescence is invisible to other animals, which allows these dragonfish extra light at dark ocean depths without attracting or signaling predators.

=== Terrestrial ===
==== Amphibians ====
Fluorescence is widespread among amphibians and has been documented in several families of frogs, salamanders and caecilians, but the extent of it varies greatly.

The polka-dot tree frog (&quot;Hypsiboas punctatus&quot;), widely found in South America, was unintentionally discovered to be the first fluorescent amphibian in 2017. The fluorescence was traced to a new compound found in the lymph and skin glands. The main fluorescent compound is Hyloin-L1 and it gives a blue-green glow when exposed to violet or ultraviolet light. The scientists behind the discovery suggested that the fluorescence can be used for communication. They speculated that fluorescence possibly is relatively widespread among frogs. Only a few months later, fluorescence was discovered in the closely related &quot;Hypsiboas atlanticus&quot;. Because it is linked to secretions from skin glands, they can also leave fluorescent markings on surfaces where they have been.

In 2019, two other frogs, the tiny pumpkin toadlet (&quot;Brachycephalus ephippium&quot;) and red pumpkin toadlet (&quot;B. pitanga&quot;) of southeastern Brazil, were found to have naturally fluorescent skeletons, which are visible through their skin when exposed to ultraviolet light. It was initially speculated that the fluorescence supplemented their already aposematic colours (they are toxic) or that it was related to mate choice (species recognition or determining fitness of a potential partner), but later studies indicate that the former explanation is unlikely, as predation attempts on the toadlets appear to be unaffected by the presence/absence of fluorescence.

In 2020 it was confirmed that green or yellow fluorescence is widespread not only in adult frogs that are exposed to blue or ultraviolet light, but also among tadpoles, salamanders and caecilians. The extent varies greatly depending on species; in some it is highly distinct and in others it is barely noticeable. It can be based on their skin pigmentation, their mucus or their bones.

==== Butterflies ====
Swallowtail (&quot;Papilio&quot;) butterflies have complex systems for emitting fluorescent light. Their wings contain pigment-infused crystals that provide directed fluorescent light. These crystals function to produce fluorescent light best when they absorb radiance from sky-blue light (wavelength about 420 nm). The wavelengths of light that the butterflies see the best correspond to the absorbance of the crystals in the butterfly&#x27;s wings. This likely functions to enhance the capacity for signaling.

==== Parrots ====
Parrots have fluorescent plumage that may be used in mate signaling. A study using mate-choice experiments on budgerigars (&quot;Melopsittacus undulates&quot;) found compelling support for fluorescent sexual signaling, with both males and females significantly preferring birds with the fluorescent experimental stimulus. This study suggests that the fluorescent plumage of parrots is not simply a by-product of pigmentation, but instead an adapted sexual signal. Considering the intricacies of the pathways that produce fluorescent pigments, there may be significant costs involved. Therefore, individuals exhibiting strong fluorescence may be honest indicators of high individual quality, since they can deal with the associated costs.

==== Arachnids ====

Spiders fluoresce under UV light and possess a huge diversity of fluorophores. Andrews, Reed, &amp; Masta noted that spiders are the only known group in which fluorescence is &quot;taxonomically widespread, variably expressed, evolutionarily labile, and probably under selection and potentially of ecological importance for intraspecific and interspecific signaling&quot;. They showed that fluorescence evolved multiple times across spider taxa, with novel fluorophores evolving during spider diversification.

In some spiders, ultraviolet cues are important for predator–prey interactions, intraspecific communication, and camouflage-matching with fluorescent flowers. Differing ecological contexts could favor inhibition or enhancement of fluorescence expression, depending upon whether fluorescence helps spiders be cryptic or makes them more conspicuous to predators. Therefore, natural selection could be acting on expression of fluorescence across spider species.

Scorpions are also fluorescent, in their case due to the presence of beta carboline in their cuticles.

==== Platypus ====
In 2020 fluorescence was reported for several platypus specimens.

==== Plants ====
Many plants are fluorescent due to the presence of chlorophyll, which is probably the most widely distributed fluorescent molecule, producing red emission under a range of excitation wavelengths. This attribute of chlorophyll is commonly used by ecologists to measure photosynthetic efficiency.

The &quot;Mirabilis jalapa&quot; flower contains violet, fluorescent betacyanins and yellow, fluorescent betaxanthins. Under white light, parts of the flower containing only betaxanthins appear yellow, but in areas where both betaxanthins and betacyanins are present, the visible fluorescence of the flower is faded due to internal light-filtering mechanisms. Fluorescence was previously suggested to play a role in pollinator attraction, however, it was later found that the visual signal by fluorescence is negligible compared to the visual signal of light reflected by the flower.

=== Abiotic ===
==== Gemology, mineralogy and geology ====
In addition to the eponymous fluorspar, many
gemstones and minerals may have a distinctive fluorescence or may fluoresce differently under short-wave ultraviolet, long-wave ultraviolet, visible light, or X-rays.

Many types of calcite and amber will fluoresce under shortwave UV, longwave UV and visible light. Rubies, emeralds, and diamonds exhibit red fluorescence under long-wave UV, blue and sometimes green light; diamonds also emit light under X-ray radiation.

Fluorescence in minerals is caused by a wide range of activators. In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission. Furthermore, the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent manganese, in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of calcite, the green fluorescence of willemite, the yellow fluorescence of esperite, and the orange fluorescence of wollastonite and clinohedrite. Hexavalent uranium, in the form of the uranyl cation (), fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as autunite or andersonite, and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of hyalite opal. Trivalent chromium at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of ruby. Divalent europium is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral fluorite. Trivalent lanthanides such as terbium and dysprosium are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of zircon. Powellite (calcium molybdate) and scheelite (calcium tungstate) fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively. When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher-energy tungsten to the lower-energy molybdenum, such that fairly low levels of molybdenum are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for scheelite, instead of blue. Low-iron sphalerite (zinc sulfide), fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.

Crude oil (petroleum) fluoresces in a range of colors, from dull-brown for heavy oils and tars through to bright-yellowish and bluish-white for very light oils and condensates. This phenomenon is used in oil exploration drilling to identify very small amounts of oil in drill cuttings and core samples.

Humic acids and fulvic acids produced by the degradation of organic matter in soils (humus) may also fluoresce because of the presence of aromatic cycles in their complex molecular structures. Humic substances dissolved in groundwater can be detected and characterized by spectrofluorimetry.

==== Organic liquids ====

Organic (carbon based) solutions such anthracene or stilbene, dissolved in benzene or toluene, fluoresce with ultraviolet or gamma ray irradiation. The decay times of this fluorescence are on the order of nanoseconds, since the duration of the light depends on the lifetime of the excited states of the fluorescent material, in this case anthracene or stilbene.

Scintillation is defined a flash of light produced in a transparent material by the passage of a particle (an electron, an alpha particle, an ion, or a high-energy photon). Stilbene and derivatives are used in scintillation counters to detect such particles. Stilbene is also one of the gain mediums used in dye lasers.

==== Atmosphere ====
Fluorescence is observed in the atmosphere when the air is under energetic electron bombardment. In cases such as the natural aurora, high-altitude nuclear explosions, and rocket-borne electron gun experiments, the molecules and ions formed have a fluorescent response to light.

==== Common materials that fluoresce ====
* Vitamin B2 fluoresces yellow.
* Tonic water fluoresces blue due to the presence of quinine.
* Highlighter ink is often fluorescent due to the presence of pyranine.
* Banknotes, postage stamps and credit cards often have fluorescent security features.

== In novel technology ==
In August 2020 researchers reported the creation of the brightest fluorescent solid optical materials so far by enabling the transfer of properties of highly fluorescent dyes via spatial and electronic isolation of the dyes by mixing cationic dyes with anion-binding cyanostar macrocycles. According to a co-author these materials may have applications in areas such as solar energy harvesting, bioimaging, and lasers.

== Applications ==
=== Lighting ===

The common fluorescent lamp relies on fluorescence. Inside the glass tube is a partial vacuum and a small amount of mercury. An electric discharge in the tube causes the mercury atoms to emit mostly ultraviolet light. The tube is lined with a coating of a fluorescent material, called the &quot;phosphor&quot;, which absorbs ultraviolet light and re-emits visible light. Fluorescent lighting is more energy-efficient than incandescent lighting elements. However, the uneven spectrum of traditional fluorescent lamps may cause certain colors to appear different from when illuminated by incandescent light or daylight. The mercury vapor emission spectrum is dominated by a short-wave UV line at 254 nm (which provides most of the energy to the phosphors), accompanied by visible light emission at 436 nm (blue), 546 nm (green) and 579 nm (yellow-orange). These three lines can be observed superimposed on the white continuum using a hand spectroscope, for light emitted by the usual white fluorescent tubes. These same visible lines, accompanied by the emission lines of trivalent europium and trivalent terbium, and further accompanied by the emission continuum of divalent europium in the blue region, comprise the more discontinuous light emission of the modern trichromatic phosphor systems used in many compact fluorescent lamp and traditional lamps where better color rendition is a goal.

Fluorescent lights were first available to the public at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Improvements since then have largely been better phosphors, longer life, and more consistent internal discharge, and easier-to-use shapes (such as compact fluorescent lamps). Some high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps couple their even-greater electrical efficiency with phosphor enhancement for better color rendition.

White light-emitting diodes (LEDs) became available in the mid-1990s as LED lamps, in which blue light emitted from the semiconductor strikes phosphors deposited on the tiny chip. The combination of the blue light that continues through the phosphor and the green to red fluorescence from the phosphors produces a net emission of white light.

Glow sticks sometimes utilize fluorescent materials to absorb light from the chemiluminescent reaction and emit light of a different color.

=== Analytical chemistry ===
Many analytical procedures involve the use of a fluorometer, usually with a single exciting wavelength and single detection wavelength. Because of the sensitivity that the method affords, fluorescent molecule concentrations as low as 1 part per trillion can be measured.

Fluorescence in several wavelengths can be detected by an array detector, to detect compounds from HPLC flow. Also, TLC plates can be visualized if the compounds or a coloring reagent is fluorescent. Fluorescence is most effective when there is a larger ratio of atoms at lower energy levels in a Boltzmann distribution. There is, then, a higher probability of excitement and release of photons by lower-energy atoms, making analysis more efficient.

=== Spectroscopy ===

Usually the setup of a fluorescence assay involves a light source, which may emit many different wavelengths of light. In general, a single wavelength is required for proper analysis, so, in order to selectively filter the light, it is passed through an excitation monochromator, and then that chosen wavelength is passed through the sample cell. After absorption and re-emission of the energy, many wavelengths may emerge due to Stokes shift and various electron transitions. To separate and analyze them, the fluorescent radiation is passed through an emission monochromator, and observed selectively by a detector.

=== Lasers ===

Lasers most often use the fluorescence of certain materials as their active media, such as the red glow produced by a ruby (chromium sapphire), the infrared of titanium sapphire, or the unlimited range of colors produced by organic dyes. These materials normally fluoresce through a process called spontaneous emission, in which the light is emitted in all directions and often at many discrete spectral lines all at once. In many lasers, the fluorescent medium is &quot;pumped&quot; by exposing it to an intense light source, creating a population inversion, meaning that more of its atoms become in an excited state (high energy) rather than at ground state (low energy). When this occurs, the spontaneous fluorescence can then induce the other atoms to emit their photons in the same direction and at the same wavelength, creating stimulated emission. When a portion of the spontaneous fluorescence is trapped between two mirrors, nearly all of the medium&#x27;s fluorescence can be stimulated to emit along the same line, producing a laser beam.

=== Biochemistry and medicine ===
Fluorescence in the life sciences is used generally as a non-destructive way of tracking or analysis of biological molecules by means of the fluorescent emission at a specific frequency where there is no background from the excitation light, as relatively few cellular components are naturally fluorescent (called intrinsic or autofluorescence).
In fact, a protein or other component can be &quot;labelled&quot; with an extrinsic fluorophore, a fluorescent dye that can be a small molecule, protein, or quantum dot, finding a large use in many biological applications.

The quantification of a dye is done with a spectrofluorometer and finds additional applications in:

==== Microscopy ====
* When scanning the fluorescence intensity across a plane one has fluorescence microscopy of tissues, cells, or subcellular structures, which is accomplished by labeling an antibody with a fluorophore and allowing the antibody to find its target antigen within the sample. Labelling multiple antibodies with different fluorophores allows visualization of multiple targets within a single image (multiple channels). DNA microarrays are a variant of this.
* Immunology: An antibody is first prepared by having a fluorescent chemical group attached, and the sites (e.g., on a microscopic specimen) where the antibody has bound can be seen, and even quantified, by the fluorescence.
* FLIM (Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy) can be used to detect certain bio-molecular interactions that manifest themselves by influencing fluorescence lifetimes.
* Cell and molecular biology: detection of colocalization using fluorescence-labelled antibodies for selective detection of the antigens of interest using specialized software such as ImageJ.

==== Other techniques ====
* FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer, also known as fluorescence resonance energy transfer) is used to study protein interactions, detect specific nucleic acid sequences and used as biosensors, while fluorescence lifetime (FLIM) can give an additional layer of information.
* Biotechnology: biosensors using fluorescence are being studied as possible Fluorescent glucose biosensors.
* Automated sequencing of DNA by the chain termination method; each of four different chain terminating bases has its own specific fluorescent tag. As the labelled DNA molecules are separated, the fluorescent label is excited by a UV source, and the identity of the base terminating the molecule is identified by the wavelength of the emitted light.
* FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting). One of several important cell sorting techniques used in the separation of different cell lines (especially those isolated from animal tissues).
* DNA detection: the compound ethidium bromide, in aqueous solution, has very little fluorescence, as it is quenched by water. Ethidium bromide&#x27;s fluorescence is greatly enhanced after it binds to DNA, so this compound is very useful in visualising the location of DNA fragments in agarose gel electrophoresis. Intercalated ethidium is in a hydrophobic environment when it is between the base pairs of the DNA, protected from quenching by water which is excluded from the local environment of the intercalated ethidium. Ethidium bromide may be carcinogenic – an arguably safer alternative is the dye SYBR Green.
* FIGS (Fluorescence image-guided surgery) is a medical imaging technique that uses fluorescence to detect properly labeled structures during surgery.
* Intravascular fluorescence is a catheter-based medical imaging technique that uses fluorescence to detect high-risk features of atherosclerosis and unhealed vascular stent devices. Plaque autofluorescence has been used in a first-in-man study in coronary arteries in combination with optical coherence tomography. Molecular agents has been also used to detect specific features, such as stent fibrin accumulation and enzymatic activity related to artery inflammation.
* SAFI (species altered fluorescence imaging) an imaging technique in electrokinetics and microfluidics. It uses non-electromigrating dyes whose fluorescence is easily quenched by migrating chemical species of interest. The dye(s) are usually seeded everywhere in the flow and differential quenching of their fluorescence by analytes is directly observed.
* Fluorescence-based assays for screening toxic chemicals. The optical assays consist of a mixture of environment-sensitive fluorescent dyes and human skin cells that generate fluorescence spectra patterns. This approach can reduce the need for laboratory animals in biomedical research and pharmaceutical industry.
* Bone-margin detection: Alizarin-stained specimens and certain fossils can be lit by fluorescent lights to view anatomical structures, including bone margins.

=== Forensics ===
Fingerprints can be visualized with fluorescent compounds such as ninhydrin or DFO (1,8-Diazafluoren-9-one). Blood and other substances are sometimes detected by fluorescent reagents, like fluorescein. Fibers, and other materials that may be encountered in forensics or with a relationship to various collectibles, are sometimes fluorescent.

=== Non-destructive testing ===
Fluorescent penetrant inspection is used to find cracks and other defects on the surface of a part. Dye tracing, using fluorescent dyes, is used to find leaks in liquid and gas plumbing systems.

=== Signage ===

Fluorescent colors are frequently used in signage, particularly road signs. Fluorescent colors are generally recognizable at longer ranges than their non-fluorescent counterparts, with fluorescent orange being particularly noticeable. This property has led to its frequent use in safety signs and labels.

=== Optical brighteners ===

Fluorescent compounds are often used to enhance the appearance of fabric and paper, causing a &quot;whitening&quot; effect. A white surface treated with an optical brightener can emit more visible light than that which shines on it, making it appear brighter. The blue light emitted by the brightener compensates for the diminishing blue of the treated material and changes the hue away from yellow or brown and toward white. Optical brighteners are used in laundry detergents, high brightness paper, cosmetics, high-visibility clothing and more.

<doc id="11556" wikidata="Q670235" url="?curid=11556" title="Fundamental theorem of arithmetic">
<text>In mathematics, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, also called the unique factorization theorem and prime factorization theorem, states that every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors. For example,
:formula_1

The theorem says two things about this example: first, that 1200 be represented as a product of primes, and second, that no matter how this is done, there will always be exactly four 2s, one 3, two 5s, and no other primes in the product.

The requirement that the factors be prime is necessary: factorizations containing composite numbers may not be unique 
(for example, formula_2).

This theorem is one of the main reasons why 1 is not considered a prime number: if 1 were prime, then factorization into primes would not be unique; for example, formula_3

The theorem generalizes to other algebraic structures that are called unique factorization domains and include principal ideal domains, Euclidean domains, and polynomial rings over a field. However, the theorem does not hold for algebraic integers. This failure of unique factorization is one of the reasons for the difficulty of the proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. The implicit use of unique factorization in rings of algebraic integers is behind the error of many of the numerous false proofs that have been written during the 358 years between Fermat&#x27;s statement and Wiles&#x27;s proof.

==History==

The fundamental theorem can be derived from Book VII, propositions 30, 31 and 32, and Book IX, proposition 14 of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;.
(In modern terminology: if a prime &quot;p&quot; divides the product &quot;ab&quot;, then &quot;p&quot; divides either &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; or both.) Proposition 30 is referred to as Euclid&#x27;s lemma, and it is the key in the proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

(In modern terminology: every integer greater than one is divided evenly by some prime number.) Proposition 31 is proved directly by infinite descent.

Proposition 32 is derived from proposition 31, and proves that the decomposition is possible.

(In modern terminology: a least common multiple of several prime numbers is not a multiple of any other prime number.) Book IX, proposition 14 is derived from Book VII, proposition 30, and proves partially that the decomposition is unique – a point critically noted by André Weil. Indeed, in this proposition the exponents are all equal to one, so nothing is said for the general case.

While Euclid took the first step on the way to the existence of prime factorization, Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī took the final step and stated for the first time the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

Article 16 of Gauss&#x27;s &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; is an early modern statement and proof employing modular arithmetic.

==Applications==
===Canonical representation of a positive integer=== 

Every positive integer can be represented in exactly one way as a product of prime powers
:formula_4
where are primes and the are positive integers. This representation is commonly extended to all positive integers, including 1, by the convention that the empty product is equal to 1 (the empty product corresponds to ).

This representation is called the canonical representation of , or the standard form of &quot;n&quot;. For example,

:999 = 33×37,
:1000 = 23×53,
:1001 = 7×11×13.

Factors may be inserted without changing the value of (for example, ). In fact, any positive integer can be uniquely represented as an infinite product taken over all the positive prime numbers, as
:formula_5
where a finite number of the are positive integers, and the others are zero. 

Allowing negative exponents provides a canonical form for positive rational numbers.

===Arithmetic operations===
The canonical representations of the product, greatest common divisor (GCD), and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; can be expressed simply in terms of the canonical representations of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; themselves:
:formula_6

However, integer factorization, especially of large numbers, is much more difficult than computing products, GCDs, or LCMs. So these formulas have limited use in practice.

===Arithmetic functions===
Many arithmetic functions are defined using the canonical representation. In particular, the values of additive and multiplicative functions are determined by their values on the powers of prime numbers.

==Proof==
The proof uses Euclid&#x27;s lemma (&quot;Elements&quot; VII, 30): If a prime divides the product of two integers, then it must divide at least one of these integers.

===Existence===
It must be shown that every integer greater than is either prime or a product of primes. First, is prime. Then, by strong induction, assume this is true for all numbers greater than and less than . If is prime, there is nothing more to prove. Otherwise, there are integers and , where , and . By the induction hypothesis, and are products of primes. But then is a product of primes.

===Uniqueness===
Suppose, to the contrary, there is an integer that has two distinct prime factorizations. Let be the least such integer and write , where each and is prime. We see that divides , so divides some by Euclid&#x27;s lemma. Without loss of generality, say divides . Since and are both prime, it follows that . Returning to our factorizations of , we may cancel these two factors to conclude that . We now have two distinct prime factorizations of some integer strictly smaller than , which contradicts the minimality of .

===Uniqueness without Euclid&#x27;s lemma===
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic can also be proved without using Euclid&#x27;s lemma. The proof that follows is inspired by Euclid&#x27;s original version of the Euclidean algorithm. 

Assume that formula_7 is the smallest positive integer which is the product of prime numbers in two different ways. Incidentally, this implies that formula_7, if it exists, must be a composite number greater than formula_9. Now, say 

:formula_10

Every formula_11 must be distinct from every formula_12 Otherwise, if say formula_13 then there would exist some positive integer formula_14 that is smaller than and has two distinct prime factorizations. One may also suppose that formula_15 by exchanging the two factorizations, if needed.

Setting formula_16 and formula_17 one has formula_18
Also, since formula_15 one has formula_20
It then follows that
:formula_21

As the positive integers less than have been supposed to have a unique prime factorization, formula_22 must occur in the factorization of either formula_23 or . The latter case is impossible, as , being smaller than , must have a unique prime factorization, and formula_22 differs from every formula_12 The former case is also impossible, as, if formula_22 is a divisor of formula_27 it must be also a divisor of formula_28 which is impossible as formula_22 and formula_30 are distinct primes.

Therefore, there cannot exist a smallest integer with more than a single distinct prime factorization. Every positive integer must either be a prime number itself, which would factor uniquely, or a composite that also factors uniquely into primes, or in the case of the integer formula_9, not factor into any prime.

==Generalizations==

The first generalization of the theorem is found in Gauss&#x27;s second monograph (1832) on biquadratic reciprocity. This paper introduced what is now called the ring of Gaussian integers, the set of all complex numbers &quot;a&quot; + &quot;bi&quot; where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are integers. It is now denoted by formula_32 He showed that this ring has the four units ±1 and ±&quot;i&quot;, that the non-zero, non-unit numbers fall into two classes, primes and composites, and that (except for order), the composites have unique factorization as a product of primes (up to the order and multiplication by units).

Similarly, in 1844 while working on cubic reciprocity, Eisenstein introduced the ring formula_33, where formula_34   formula_35 is a cube root of unity. This is the ring of Eisenstein integers, and he proved it has the six units formula_36 and that it has unique factorization.

However, it was also discovered that unique factorization does not always hold. An example is given by formula_37. In this ring one has

:formula_38

Examples like this caused the notion of &quot;prime&quot; to be modified. In formula_39 it can be proven that if any of the factors above can be represented as a product, for example, 2 = &quot;ab&quot;, then one of &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; must be a unit. This is the traditional definition of &quot;prime&quot;. It can also be proven that none of these factors obeys Euclid&#x27;s lemma; for example, 2 divides neither (1 + ) nor (1 − ) even though it divides their product 6. In algebraic number theory 2 is called irreducible in formula_39 (only divisible by itself or a unit) but not prime in formula_39 (if it divides a product it must divide one of the factors). The mention of formula_39 is required because 2 is prime and irreducible in formula_43 Using these definitions it can be proven that in any integral domain a prime must be irreducible. Euclid&#x27;s classical lemma can be rephrased as &quot;in the ring of integers formula_44 every irreducible is prime&quot;. This is also true in formula_45 and formula_46 but not in formula_47

The rings in which factorization into irreducibles is essentially unique are called unique factorization domains. Important examples are polynomial rings over the integers or over a field, Euclidean domains and principal ideal domains.

In 1843 Kummer introduced the concept of ideal number, which was developed further by Dedekind (1876) into the modern theory of ideals, special subsets of rings. Multiplication is defined for ideals, and the rings in which they have unique factorization are called Dedekind domains.

There is a version of unique factorization for ordinals, though it requires some additional conditions to ensure uniqueness.

Any commutative Möbius monoid satisfies a unique factorization theorem and thus possesses arithmetical properties similar to those of the multiplicative semigroup of positive integers. Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is, in fact, a special case of the unique factorization theorem in commutative Möbius monoids.

<doc id="11558" wikidata="Q9764" url="?curid=11558" title="Flamenco">
<text>Flamenco () is an art form based on the various folkloric music traditions of southern Spain, developed within the gitano subculture of the region of Andalusia, and also having historical presence in Extremadura and Murcia. In a wider sense, the term is used to refer to a variety of both contemporary and traditional musical styles typical of southern Spain. Flamenco is closely associated to the gitanos of the Romani ethnicity who have contributed significantly to its origination and professionalization. However, its style is uniquely Andalusian and flamenco artists have historically included Spaniards of both gitano and non-gitano heritage.

The oldest record of flamenco music dates to 1774 in the book &quot;Las Cartas Marruecas&quot; (The Moroccan Letters) by José Cadalso. The development of flamenco over the past two centuries is well documented: &quot;the theatre movement of sainetes (one-act plays) and tonadillas, popular song books and song sheets, customs, studies of dances, and &quot;toques&quot;, perfection, newspapers, graphic documents in paintings and engravings. ... in continuous evolution together with rhythm, the poetic stanzas, and the ambiance.&quot;

On 16 November 2010, UNESCO declared flamenco one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

== Etymology ==
Historically, the term &quot;Flamenco&quot; was used to identify the Romani people (Gitanos) of Spain. The English traveller George Borrow who travelled through Spain during the 1830s stated that the Gitanos were also called Flemish (in Spanish, &#x27;flamenco&#x27;) due to German and Flemish being erroneously considered synonymous. According to flamencologist Cristina Cruces-Roldán, a year prior to Borrow&#x27;s account, there already existed a Gitano party in Madrid that was clearly identified as Flamenco. This equivalency between Gitano and Flamenco is also noted by Manuel Fernández y González, Demófilo, and the scholar Irving Brown who stated in 1938 that &quot;Flamenco is simply another term for Gitano, with special connotations.&quot;

The origins of the term lie in the sociological prejudice towards the Roma who were seen as ruffians and cocky troublemakers by the Spaniards and were thus associated with the 18th century German colonists of the Sierra Morena who formed groups of urban Bohemians that lived outside the law and were seen as idle and lazy. Other less successful hypotheses include those of Felipe Pedrell and Carlos Alemendros who state that while the term Flamenco is Spanish for Flemish, it is actually synonymous with &quot;Cantador&quot; (professional singer) in reference to the group of Flemish singers brought by Spanish King Carlos I in 1516. Another hypothesis that is not widely accepted is the Arabist theory of Blas Infante, which presents in his book &quot;Orígenes de lo flamenco (Origins of flamenco)&quot;&quot;,&quot; Flamenco as a phonetic deformation of Arabic &quot;fellah-mengu&quot; (runaway laborer) or was derived from the Arabic terms &quot;Felah-Mengus,&quot; which together mean &quot;wandering peasant&quot;.

The first use of the term Flamenco to refer to the music genre appears in a 1847 newspaper article of &quot;El Espectador&quot; where it was referred to as a &quot;Gitano genre.&quot; In the early years of Flamenco, the term was versatile and was used to refer to a variety of concepts in the Gitano-Andalusian world. For example, in the 1860s-70s this versatility was exemplified through its use to refer to a musical style and a certain aesthetic, manners, and way of life that were perceived to be Gitano. At that time, Flamenco was not a strict genre but a way of performing music in a Gitano-Andalusian style.

== History ==
=== Cultural Origins ===
There are hypotheses that point to the influence on flamenco of types of dance from the Indian subcontinent; the place of origin of the Romani people. The Indo-Pakistani scales of Flamenco were introduced to Andalusia by the Romani migrations from Northern India. These Roma migrants also brought bells, and an extensive repertoire of songs and dances. Upon arrival to Andalusia in the 15th century, they were exposed to the rich Arab-Andalusian music culture, itself a hybrid of Spanish music tradition going back to the 8th century with the establishment of Al-Andalus, which brought in traditions and music from the Arabian peninsula, Northern Africa and Sephardic features. Some of the instruments associated with Flamenco and Spanish folklore in different regions today, are the wooden castanets and tambourines, both believed to originate during the Al Andalus period. This centuries-long period of cultural intermingling, formed the roots of Flamenco song and dance genres.

=== Birth of Flamenco ===
It is believed that the flamenco genre emerged at the end of the 18th century in cities and agrarian towns of Baja Andalusia, highlighting Jerez de la Frontera as the first written vestige of this art, although there is practically no data related to those dates and the manifestations of this time are more typical of the bolero school than of flamenco. It appeared as a modern art form from the convergence of the urban subaltern groups, Gitano communities, and journeyman of Andalusia that formed the marginalized Flamenco artistic working class who established Flamenco as a singular art form, marked from the beginning by the Gitano brand. Andalusia was the origin and cradle of the early Flamenco cantaores and of the three or four dozen Gitano families who created and cultivated Flamenco.

=== The casticismo ===
During the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, a number of factors led to rise in Spain of a phenomenon known as &quot;Costumbrismo Andaluz&quot; or &quot;Andalusian Mannerism&quot;.

In 1783 Carlos III promulgated a pragmatics that regulated the social situation of the . This was a momentous event in the history of Spanish gitanos who, after centuries of marginalization and persecution, saw their legal situation improve substantially.

After the Spanish War of Independence (1808–1812), a feeling of racial pride developed in the Spanish conscience, in opposition to the &quot;gallified&quot; &quot;Afrancesados&quot; - Spaniards who were influenced by French culture and the idea of the enlightenment. In this context, gitanos were seen as an ideal embodiment of Spanish culture and the emergence of the bullfighting schools of Ronda and Seville, the rise of the Bandidos and Vaqueros led to a taste for Andalusian romantic culture which triumphed in the Madrid court.

At this time there is evidence of disagreements due to the introduction of innovations in art.

=== Los cafés cantantes ===

In 1881 Silverio Franconetti opened the first flamenco singer café in Seville. In Silverio&#x27;s café the cantaores were in a very competitive environment, which allowed the emergence of the professional cantaor and served as a crucible where flamenco art was configured. Locals learned the cantes, while reinterpreting the Andalusian folk songs in their own style, expanding the repertoire. Likewise, the taste of the public contributed to configure the flamenco genre, unifying its technique and its theme.

=== The antiflamenquismo of &quot;La generación del 98&quot; ===
&quot;Flamenquismo&quot;, defined by the Royal Spanish Academy as a &quot;fondness for flamenco art and customs&quot;, is a conceptual catch-all where flamenco singing and a fondness for bullfighting, among other traditional Spanish elements, fit. These customs were strongly attacked by the generation of 98, all of its members being &quot;anti-flamenco&quot;, with the exception of the Machado brothers, Manuel and Antonio. Being Sevillians and sons of the folklorist Demófilo Machado, the brothers had a more complex view of the matter. The greatest standard bearer of anti-flamenquism was the Madrid writer Eugenio Noel, who, in his youth, had been a militant &quot;casticista&quot;. Noel attributed to flamenco and bullfighting the origin of the ills of Spain which he saw as manifestations of the country&#x27;s Oriental character which hindered economic and social development. These considerations caused an insurmountable rift to be established for decades between flamenco and most &quot;intellectuals&quot; of the time.

=== The flamenca opera ===
Between 1920 and 1955, flamenco shows began to be held in bullrings and theaters, under the name &quot;flamenco opera&quot;. This denomination was an economic strategy of the promoters, since opera only paid 3% while variety shows paid 10%. At this time, flamenco shows spread throughout Spain and the main cities of the world. The great social and commercial success achieved by flamenco at this time eliminated some of the oldest and most sober styles from the stage, in favor of lighter airs, such as cantiñas, los cantes de ida y vuelta and fandangos, of which many personal versions were created. The purist critics attacked this lightness of the cantes, as well as the use of falsete and the gaitero style.

In the line of purism, the poet Federico García Lorca and the composer Manuel de Falla had the idea of concurso de cante jondo en Granada en 1922. Both artists conceived of flamenco as folklore, not as a scenic artistic genre; for this reason, they were concerned, since they believed that the massive triumph of flamenco would end its purest and deepest roots. To remedy this, they organized a cante jondo contest in which only amateurs could participate and in which festive cantes (such as cantiñas) were excluded, which Falla and Lorca did not consider jondos, but flamencos. The jury was chaired by Antonio Chacón, who at that time was the leading figure in cante. The winners were &quot;El Tenazas&quot;, a retired professional cantaor from Morón de la Frontera, and Manuel Ortega, an eight-year-old boy from Seville who would go down in flamenco history as Manolo Caracol. The contest turned out to be a failure due to the scant echo it had and because Lorca and Falla did not know how to understand the professional character that flamenco already had at that time, striving in vain to seek a purity that never existed in an art that was characterized by mixture and the personal innovation of its creators. Apart from this failure, with the Generation of &#x27;27, whose most eminent members were Andalusians and therefore knew the genre first-hand, the recognition of flamenco by intellectuals began.

At that time, there were already flamenco recordings related to Christmas, which can be divided into two groups: the traditional flamenco carol and flamenco songs that adapt their lyrics to the Christmas theme. These cantes have been maintained to this day, the Zambomba Jerezana being spatially representative, declared an Asset of Intangible Cultural Interest by the Junta de Andalucía in December 2015.

During the Spanish Civil War, a large number of singers were exiled or died defending the Republic and the humiliations to which they were being subjected by the National Party: Bando Nacional: Corruco de Algeciras, Chaconcito, El Carbonerillo, El Chato De Las Ventas, Vallejito, Rita la Cantaora, Angelillo, Guerrita are some of them. In the postwar period and the first years of the Franco regime, the world of flamenco was viewed with suspicion, as the authorities were not clear that this genre contributed to the national conscience. However, the regime soon ended up adopting flamenco as one of the quintessential Spanish cultural manifestations. The singers who have survived the war go from stars to almost outcasts, singing for the young men in the private rooms of the brothels in the center of Seville where they have to adapt to the whims of aristocrats, soldiers and businessmen who have become rich.

In short, the period of the flamenco opera was a time open to creativity and that definitely made up most of the flamenco repertoire. It was the Golden Age of this genre, with figures such as Antonio Chacón, Manuel Vallejo , Manuel Torre, La Niña de los Peines, Pepe Marchena and Manolo Caracol.

=== Flamencología ===
Starting in the 1950s, abundant anthropological and musicological studies on flamenco began to be published. In 1954 Hispavox published the first Antología del Cante Flamenco, a sound recording that was a great shock to its time, dominated by orchestrated cante and, consequently, mystified. In 1955, the Argentine intellectual Anselmo González Climent published an essay called &quot;Flamencología&quot;, whose title he baptized the &quot;set of knowledge, techniques, etc., on flamenco singing and dancing.&quot; This book dignified the study of flamenco by applying the academic methodology of musicology to it and served as the basis for subsequent studies on this genre.

As a result, in 1956 the National Contest of Cante Jondo de Córdoba was organized and in 1958 the first flamencology chair was founded in Jerez de la Frontera, the oldest academic institution dedicated to the study, research, conservation, promotion and defense of the flamenco art. Likewise, in 1963 the Cordovan poet Ricardo Molina and the Sevillian cantaor Antonio Mairena published Alalimón Mundo y Formas del Cante flamenco, which has become a must-have reference work.

For a long time the Mairenistas postulates were considered practically unquestionable, until they found an answer in other authors who elaborated the &quot;Andalusian thesis&quot;, which defended that flamenco was a genuinely Andalusian product, since it had been developed entirely in this region and because its styles basic ones derived from the folklore of Andalusia. They also maintained that the Andalusian Gitanos had contributed decisively to their formation, highlighting the exceptional nature of flamenco among gypsy music and dances from other parts of Spain and Europe. The unification of the Gitanos and Andalusian thesis has ended up being the most accepted today. In short, between the 1950s and 1970s, flamenco went from being a mere show to also becoming an object of study.

=== Flamenco protest during the Franco regime ===
Flamenco became one of the symbols of Spanish national identity during the Franco regime, since the regime knew how to appropriate a folklore traditionally associated with Andalusia to promote national unity and attract tourism, constituting what was called national-flamenquismo. Hence, flamenco had long been seen as a reactionary or retrograde element. In the mid-60s and until the transition, cantaores who opposed the regime began to appear with the use of protest lyrics. These include: José Menese and lyricist Francisco Moreno Galván, Enrique Morente, Manuel Gerena, El Lebrijano, El Cabrero, Lole y Manuel, el Piki or Luis Marín, among many others.

In contrast to this conservatism with which it was associated during the Franco regime, flamenco suffered the influence of the wave of activism that also shook the university against the repression of the regime when university students came into contact with this art in the recitals that were held, for example, at the Colegio Mayor de San Juan Evangelista: &quot;flamenco amateurs and professionals got involved with performances of a manifestly political nature. It was a kind of flamenco protest charged with protest, which meant censorship and repression for the flamenco activists &quot;.

As the political transition progressed, the demands were deflated as flamenco inserted itself within the flows of globalized art. At the same time, this art was institutionalized until it reached the point that the Junta de Andalucía was attributed in 2007 &quot;exclusive competence in matters of knowledge, conservation, research, training, promotion and dissemination&quot;.

=== Flamenco fusion ===

In the 1970s, there were airs of social and political change in Spain, and Spanish society was already quite influenced by various musical styles from the rest of Europe and the United States. There were also numerous singers who had grown up listening to Antonio Mairena, Pepe Marchena and Manolo Caracol. The combination of both factors led to a revolutionary period called flamenco fusion.

The singer Rocío Jurado internationalized flamenco at the beginning of the 70s, replacing the bata de cola with evening dresses. Her facet in the &quot;Fandangos de Huelva&quot; and in the Alegrías was recognized internationally for her perfect voice tessitura in these genres. She used to be accompanied in her concerts by guitarists Enrique de Melchor and Tomatito, not only at the national level but in countries like Colombia, Venezuela and Puerto Rico.

The musical representative José Antonio Pulpón was a decisive character in that fusion, as he urged the cantaor Agujetas to collaborate with the Sevillian Andalusian rock group &quot;Pata Negra&quot;, the most revolutionary couple since Antonio Chacón and Ramón Montoya, initiating a new path for flamenco. It also fostered the artistic union between the virtuoso guitarist from Algeciras Paco de Lucía and the long-standing singer from the island Camarón de la Isla, who gave a creative impulse to flamenco that would mean its definitive break with Mairena&#x27;s conservatism. When both artists undertook their solo careers, Camarón became a mythical cantaor for his art and personality, with a legion of followers, while Paco de Lucía reconfigured the entire musical world of flamenco, opening up to new influences, such as Brazilian music, Arabic and jazz and introducing new musical instruments such as the Peruvian cajon, the transverse flute, etc.

Other leading performers in this process of formal flamenco renewal were Juan Peña El Lebrijano, who married flamenco with Andalusian music, and Enrique Morente, who throughout his long artistic career has oscillated between the purism of his first recordings and the crossbreeding with rock, or Remedios Amaya from Triana, cultivator of a unique style of tangos from Extremadura, and a wedge of purity in her cante make her part of this select group of established artists. Other singers with their own style include Cancanilla de Marbella. In 2011 this style became known in India thanks to María del Mar Fernández, who acts in the video clip of the film You Live Once, entitled Señorita. The film was seen by more than 73 million viewers.

=== New flamenco ===
In the 1980s a new generation of flamenco artists emerged who had been influenced by the mythical cantaor Camarón, Paco de Lucía, Morente, etc. These artists were interested in popular urban music, which in those years was renewing the Spanish music scene, it was the time of the Movida madrileña. Among them are &quot;Pata Negra&quot;, who fused flamenco with blues and rock, Ketama, of pop and Cuban inspiration and Ray Heredia, creator of his own musical universe where flamenco occupies a central place.

Also the recording company Nuevos Medios released many musicians under the label nuevo flamenco and this denomination has grouped musicians very different from each other like Rosario Flores, daughter of Lola Flores, or the renowned singer Malú, niece of Paco de Lucía and daughter of Pepe de Lucía, who despite sympathizing with flamenco and keeping it in her discography has continued with her personal style. However, the fact that many of the interpreters of this new music are also renowned cantaores, in the case of José Mercé, El Cigala, and others, has led to labeling everything they perform as flamenco, although the genre of their songs differs quite a bit from the classic flamenco. This has generated very different feelings, both for and against.

Other contemporary artists of that moment were O&#x27;Funkillo and Ojos de Brujo, Arcángel, Miguel Poveda, Mayte Martín, Marina Heredia, Estrella Morente or Manuel Lombo, etc.

But the discussion between the difference of flamenco and new flamenco in Spain has just gained strength during since 2019 due to the success of new flamenco attracting the taste of the youngest Spanish fans but also in the international musical scene emphasizing the problem of how should we call this new musical genre mixed with flamenco.

One of these artist who has reinvented flamenco is Rosalía, an indisputable name on the international music scene. &quot;Pienso en tu mirá&quot;, &quot;Di mi nombre&quot; or the song that catapulted her to fame, &quot;Malamente&quot;, are a combination of styles that includes a flamenco/south Spain traditional musical base. Rosalía has broken the limits of this musical genre by embracing other urban rhythms, but has also created a lot of controversy about which genre is she using. The Catalan artist has been awarded several Latin GrammyAwards and MTV Video Music Awards, which also, at just 30 years old, garners more than 40 million monthly listeners on Spotify.

But it is not the only successful case, the Granada-born Dellafuente, C. Tangana, MAKA, RVFV, Demarco Flamenco, Maria Àrnal and Marcel Bagés, El Niño de Elche, Sílvia Pérez Cruz; Califato 3/4, Juanito Makandé, Soledad Morente, María José Llergo o Fuel Fandango are only a few of the new spanish musical scene that includes flamenco in their music.

It seems that the Spanish music scene is experiencing a change in its music and new rhythms are re-emerging together with new artists who are experimenting to cover a wider audience that wants to maintain the closeness that flamenco has transmitted for decades.

=== Flamenco Culture Overseas ===
The state of New Mexico, located in the southwest of the United States maintains a strong identity with Flamenco culture. The University of New Mexico located in Albuquerque offers a graduate degree program in Flamenco. Flamenco performances are widespread in the Albuquerque and Santa Fe communities, with the National institute of Flamenco sponsoring an annual festival, as well as a variety of professional flamenco performances offered at various locales. Emmy Grimm, known by her stage name La Emi is a professional Flamenco dancer and native to New Mexico who performs as well as teaches Flamenco in Santa Fe. She continues studying her art by traveling to Spain to work intensively with Carmela Greco and La Popi, as well as José Galván, Juana Amaya, Yolanda Heredia, Ivan Vargas Heredia, Torombo and Rocio Alcaide Ruiz.

== Main &quot;Palos&quot; ==

&quot;Palos&quot; (formerly known as &quot;cantes&quot;) are flamenco styles, classified by criteria such as rhythmic pattern, mode, chord progression, stanzaic form and geographic origin. There are over 50 different &quot;palos&quot;, some are sung unaccompanied while others have guitar or other accompaniment. Some forms are danced while others are not. Some are reserved for men and others for women while some may be performed by either, though these traditional distinctions are breaking down: the &quot;Farruca&quot;, for example, once a male dance, is now commonly performed by women too.

There are many ways to categorize &quot;Palos&quot; but they traditionally fall into three classes: the most serious is known as &quot;cante jondo&quot; (or &quot;cante grande&quot;), while lighter, frivolous forms are called &quot;Cante Chico&quot;. Forms that do not fit either category are classed as &quot;Cante Intermedio&quot; . These are the best known &quot;palos&quot; (; ):

===Alegrías===
The alegrías are thought to derive from the Aragonese jota, which took root in Cadiz during the Peninsular war and the establishment of the Cortes de Cadiz. That is why its classic lyrics contain so many references to the Virgen del Pilar, the Ebro River and Navarra.

Enrique Butrón is considered to have formalized the current flamenco style of alegrías and Ignacio Espeleta who introduced the characteristic &quot;tiriti, tran, tran...&quot;. Some of the best known interpreters of alegrías are Enrique el Mellizo, Chato de la Isla, Pinini, Pericón de Cádiz, Aurelio Sellés, La Perla de Cádiz, Chano Lobato and El Folli.

One of the structurally strictest forms of flamenco, a traditional dance in alegrías must contain each of the following sections: a salida (entrance), paseo (walkaround), silencio (similar to an adagio in ballet), castellana (upbeat section) zapateado (Literally &quot;a tap of the foot&quot;) and bulerías. This structure though, is not followed when alegrías are sung as a standalone song (with no dancing). In that case, the stanzas are combined freely, sometimes together with other types of cantiñas.

Alegrías has a rhythm consisting of 12 beats. It is similar to Soleares. Its beat emphasis is as follows: 1 2 [3] 4 5 [6] 7 [8] 9 [10] 11 [12]. Alegrías originated in Cádiz. Alegrías belongs to the group of &quot;palos&quot; called Cantiñas and it is usually played in a lively rhythm (120–170 beats per minute). The livelier speeds are chosen for dancing, while quieter rhythms are preferred for the song alone.

===Bulerías===
Bulerías a fast flamenco rhythm made up of a 12 beat cycle with emphasis in two general forms as follows: [12] 1 2 [3] 4 5 [6] 7 [8] 9 [10] 11 or [12] 1 2 [3] 4 5 6 [7] [8] 9 [10] 11. It originated among the Calé Romani people of Jerez during the 19th century, originally as a fast, upbeat ending to &quot;soleares&quot; or &quot;alegrias&quot;. It is among the most popular and dramatic of the flamenco forms and often ends any flamenco gathering, often accompanied by vigorous dancing and tapping.

===Fandango===
===Granaínas===
===Guajiras===
===Malagueñas===
===Peteneras===
===Saeta===
===Seguiriyas===
===Soleá===
===Tangos===
===Tanguillos===
===Tarantos===
===Tientos===

== Music ==

=== Structure ===
A typical flamenco recital with voice and guitar accompaniment comprises a series of pieces (not exactly &quot;songs&quot;) in different palos. Each song is a set of verses (called &quot;copla&quot;, &quot;tercio&quot;, or &quot;letras&quot;), punctuated by guitar interludes (&quot;falsetas&quot;). The guitarist also provides a short introduction setting the tonality, &quot;compás&quot; (see below) and tempo of the cante . In some palos, these falsetas are played with a specific structure too; for example, the typical sevillanas is played in an AAB pattern, where A and B are the same falseta with only a slight difference in the ending .

=== Harmony ===
Flamenco uses the flamenco mode (which can also be described as the modern Phrygian mode (&quot;modo frigio&quot;), or a harmonic version of that scale with a major 3rd degree), in addition to the major and minor scales commonly used in modern Western music. The Phrygian mode occurs in &quot;palos&quot; such as soleá, most bulerías, siguiriyas, tangos and tientos.
A typical chord sequence, usually called the &quot;Andalusian cadence&quot; may be viewed as in a modified Phrygian: in E the sequence is Am–G–F–E . According to Manolo Sanlúcar E is here the tonic, F has the harmonic function of dominant while Am and G assume the functions of subdominant and mediant respectively .

Guitarists tend to use only two basic inversions or &quot;chord shapes&quot; for the tonic chord (music), the open 1st inversion E and the open 3rd inversion A, though they often transpose these by using a capo. Modern guitarists such as Ramón Montoya, have introduced other positions: Montoya himself started to use other chords for the tonic in the modern Dorian sections of several &quot;palos&quot;; F for &quot;tarantas&quot;, B for &quot;granaínas&quot; and A for the &quot;minera&quot;. Montoya also created a new &quot;palo&quot; as a solo for guitar, the &quot;rondeña&quot; in C with &quot;scordatura&quot;. Later guitarists have further extended the repertoire of tonalities, chord positions and &quot;scordatura&quot;.

There are also &quot;palos&quot; in major mode; most cantiñas and alegrías, guajiras, some &quot;bulerías&quot; and &quot;tonás&quot;, and the &quot;cabales&quot; (a major type of &quot;siguiriyas&quot;). The minor mode is restricted to the &quot;Farruca&quot;, the &quot;milongas&quot; (among &quot;cantes de ida y vuelta&quot;), and some styles of &quot;tangos, bulerías&quot;, etc. In general traditional palos in major and minor mode are limited harmonically to two-chord (tonic–dominant) or three-chord (tonic–subdominant–dominant) progressions . However modern guitarists have introduced chord substitution, transition chords, and even modulation.

&quot;Fandangos&quot; and derivative &quot;palos&quot; such as &quot;malagueñas&quot;, &quot;tarantas&quot; and &quot;cartageneras are bimodal&quot;: guitar introductions are in Phrygian mode while the singing develops in major mode, modulating to Phrygian at the end of the stanza .

=== Melody ===
Dionisio Preciado, quoted by Sabas de , established the following characteristics for the melodies of flamenco singing:

#Microtonality: presence of intervals smaller than the semitone.
#Portamento: frequently, the change from one note to another is done in a smooth transition, rather than using discrete intervals.
#Short tessitura or range: Most traditional flamenco songs are limited to a range of a sixth (four tones and a half). The impression of vocal effort is the result of using different timbres, and variety is accomplished by the use of microtones.
#Use of enharmonic scale. While in equal temperament scales, enharmonics are notes with identical pitch but different spellings (e.g. A♭ and G♯); in flamenco, as in unequal temperament scales, there is a microtonal intervalic difference between enharmonic notes.
#Insistence on a note and its contiguous chromatic notes (also frequent in the guitar), producing a sense of urgency.
#Baroque ornamentation, with an expressive, rather than merely aesthetic function.
#Apparent lack of regular rhythm, especially in the siguiriyas: the melodic rhythm of the sung line is different from the metric rhythm of the accompaniment.
#Most styles express sad and bitter feelings.
#Melodic improvisation: flamenco singing is not, strictly speaking, improvised, but based on a relatively small number of traditional songs, singers add variations on the spur of the moment.

Musicologist Hipólito Rossy adds the following characteristics :

*Flamenco melodies are characterized by a descending tendency, as opposed to, for example, a typical opera aria, they usually go from the higher pitches to the lower ones, and from forte to piano, as was usual in ancient Greek scales.
*In many styles, such as soleá or siguiriya, the melody tends to proceed in contiguous degrees of the scale. Skips of a third or a fourth are rarer. However, in fandangos and fandango-derived styles, fourths and sixths can often be found, especially at the beginning of each line of verse. According to Rossy, this is proof of the more recent creation of this type of songs, influenced by Castilian jota.

=== Compás or time signature===
Compás is the Spanish word for metre or time signature (in classical music theory). It also refers to the rhythmic cycle, or layout, of a &quot;palo&quot;.

The compás is fundamental to flamenco. Compás is most often translated as rhythm but it demands far more precise interpretation than any other Western style of music. If there is no guitarist available, the compás is rendered through hand clapping (&quot;palmas&quot;) or by hitting a table with the knuckles. The guitarist uses techniques like strumming (&quot;rasgueado&quot;) or tapping the soundboard (&quot;golpe&quot;). Changes of chords emphasize the most important downbeats.

Flamenco uses three basic counts or measures: Binary, Ternary and a form of a twelve-beat cycle that is unique to flamenco. There are also free-form styles including, among others, the tonás, saetas, malagueñas, tarantos, and some types of fandangos:

*Rhythms in or . These metres are used in forms like tangos, tientos, gypsy rumba, zambra and tanguillos.
*Rhythms in . These are typical of fandangos and sevillanas, suggesting their origin as non-Roma styles, since the and measures are not common in ethnic Roma music.
*12-beat rhythms usually rendered in amalgams of + and sometimes . The 12-beat cycle is the most common in flamenco, differentiated by the accentuation of the beats in different palos. The accents do not correspond to the classic concept of the downbeat. The alternating of groups of 2 and 3 beats is also common in Spanish folk dances of the 16th century such as the &quot;zarabanda&quot;, &quot;jácara&quot; and &quot;canarios&quot;.

There are three types of 12-beat rhythms, which vary in their layouts, or use of accentuations: soleá, seguiriya and bulería:

#peteneras and guajiras: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. Both palos start with the strong accent on 12. Hence the meter is 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.
#The seguiriya, liviana, serrana, toná liviana, cabales: 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. It could also be counted like starting a bulerías scheme from 8 (see below). 
#soleá, within the cantiñas group of palos which includes the alegrías, cantiñas, mirabras, romera, caracoles and soleá por bulería (also &quot;bulería por soleá&quot;): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. For practical reasons, when transferring flamenco guitar music to sheet music, this rhythm is written as a regular .

The Bulerías is the emblematic palo of flamenco: today its 12-beat cycle is most often played with accents on the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 10th and 12th beats. The accompanying &quot;palmas&quot; are played in groups of 6 beats, giving rise to a multitude of counter-rhythms and percussive voices within the 12 beat compás. In certain regions like, Jerez, Spain, the rhythm stays in a simpler six-count rhythm, only including the twelve count in a musical resolve. This is like starting the counting at 9 so it goes this way: 9 10 11 12 1 2 - again, bold means the emphasis when clapping. In real life it is counted from 1 like: 1 2 3 4 5 6 and so on.

== Forms of flamenco expression ==

=== Toque (guitar) ===

The posture and technique of flamenco guitarists, called &quot;tocaores&quot;, differs from that used by the players of classical guitar. While the classical guitarist supports the guitar on his left leg in an inclined way, the flamenco guitarist usually crosses his legs and supports it on the one that is higher, placing the neck in an almost horizontal position with respect to the ground. Modern guitarists usually use classical guitars, although there is a specific instrument for this genre called flamenco guitar. This is less heavy, and its body is narrower than that of the classical guitar, so its sound is lower and does not overshadow the cantaor. It is usually made of cypress wood, with the handle of cedar and the top of fir. The cypress gives it a brilliant sound very suitable for the characteristics of flamenco. Formerly, the palo santo from Rio or India was also used, being the first of higher quality, but currently it is in disuse due to its scarcity. The palo santo gave guitars an amplitude of sound especially suitable for solo playing. At present, the most widely used headstock is the metal one, since the wooden one poses tuning problems.

The main guitar makers were Antonio de Torres Jurado (Almería, 1817–1892) considered the father of the guitar, , the Great Ramírez (Madrid, 1864 -1920), and his disciples Santos Hernández (Madrid, 1873–1943), who built several guitars for the maestro Sabicas, Domingo Esteso and . Also noteworthy are the Conde Brothers, Faustino (1913–1988), Mariano (1916–1989) and Julio (1918–1996), nephews of Domingo Esteso, whose children and heirs continue the saga.

The guitarists use the technique of alzapúa, picado, the strum and the tremolo, among others. One of the first touches that is considered flamenco, such as the &quot;rondeña&quot;, was the first composition recorded for solo guitar, by Julián Arcas (María, Almería, 1832 – Antequera, Málaga, 1882) in Barcelona in 1860. The strum can be performed with 5, 4 or 3 fingers, the latter invented by Sabicas. The use of the thumb is also characteristic of flamenco playing. Guitarists rest their thumb on the guitar&#x27;s soundboard and their index and middle fingers on the string above the one they are playing, thus achieving greater power and sound than the classical guitarist. The middle finger is also placed on the pickguard of the guitar for more precision and strength when plucking the string. Likewise, the use of the pickguard as an element of percussion gives great strength to flamenco guitar playing. The melodic or flourishing phrase that is inserted between the chord sequences intended to accompany the couplet is called &quot;falseta&quot;.

The accompaniment and solo playing of flamenco guitarists is based on both the modal harmonic system and the tonal system, although the most frequent is a combination of both. Some flamenco songs are performed &quot;a palo seco&quot; (a cappella), without guitar accompaniment.

=== Cante (song) ===

According to the Royal Spanish Academy, &quot;cante&quot; is called the &quot;action or effect of singing any Andalusian singing&quot;, defining &quot;flamenco singing&quot; as &quot;agitated Andalusian singing&quot; and cante jondo as &quot;the most genuine song. Andalusian, of deep feeling &quot;. The interpreter of flamenco singing is called &quot;cantaor&quot; instead of singer, with the loss of the intervocalic characteristic of the Andalusian dialect.

The most important award in flamenco singing is probably the , which has been awarded five times to: , , Antonio Mairena, Camarón de la Isla and Fosforito.

=== Baile (dance) ===
&quot;El baile flamenco&quot; is known for its emotional intensity, proud carriage, expressive use of the arms and rhythmic stamping of the feet, unlike tap dance or Irish dance which use different techniques. As with any dance form, many different styles of flamenco have developed.

In the 20th century, flamenco danced informally at gitano (Roma) celebrations in Spain was considered the most &quot;authentic&quot; form of flamenco. There was less virtuoso technique in gitano flamenco, but the music and steps are fundamentally the same. The arms are noticeably different from classical flamenco, curving around the head and body rather than extending, often with a bent elbow.

&quot;Flamenco puro&quot; otherwise known as &quot;flamenco por derecho&quot; is considered the form of performance flamenco closest to its gitano influences. In this style, the dance is often performed solo, and is based on signals and calls of structural improvisation rather than choreographed. In the improvisational style, castanets are not often used.

&quot;Classical flamenco&quot; is the style most frequently performed by Spanish flamenco dance companies. It is danced largely in a proud and upright style. For women, the back is often held in a marked back bend. Unlike the more gitano influenced styles, there is little movement of the hips, the body is tightly held, and the arms are long, like a ballet dancer. In fact, many of the dancers in these companies are trained in Ballet Clásico Español more than in the improvisational language of flamenco. Flamenco has both influenced and been influenced by Ballet Clásico Español, as evidenced by the fusion of the two ballets created by &#x27;La Argentinita&#x27; in the early part of the 20th century and later, by Joaquín Cortés, eventually by the entire Ballet Nacional de España et al.

In the 1950s Jose Greco was one of the most famous male flamenco dancers, performing on stage worldwide and on television including the Ed Sullivan Show, and reviving the art almost singlehandedly. Greco&#x27;s company left a handful of prominent pioneers, most notably: Maria Benitez and Vicente Romero of New Mexico. Today, there are many centers of flamenco art. Albuquerque, New Mexico is considered the &quot;Center of the Nation&quot; for flamenco art. Much of this is due to Maria Benitez&#x27;s 37 years of sold-out summer seasons. Albuquerque boasts three distinct prominent centers: National Institute of Flamenco, Casa Flamenca and Flamenco Works. Each center dedicates time to daily training, cultural diffusion and world-class performance equaled only to world-class performances one would find in the heart of Southern Spain, Andalucía.

Modern flamenco is a highly technical dance style requiring years of study. The emphasis for both male and female performers is on lightning-fast footwork performed with absolute precision. In addition, the dancer may have to dance while using props such as castanets, canes, shawls and fans.

&quot;Flamenco nuevo&quot; is a recent marketing phenomenon in flamenco. Marketed as a &quot;newer version&quot; of flamenco, its roots came from world-music promoters trying to sell albums of artists who created music that &quot;sounded like&quot; or had Spanish-style influences. Though some of this music was played in similar pitches, scales and was well-received, it has little to nothing to do with the art of flamenco guitar, dance, cante Jondo or the improvisational language. &quot;Nuevo flamenco&quot; consists largely of compositions and repertoire, while traditional flamenco music and dance is a language composed of stanzas, actuated by oral formulaic calls and signals.
The flamenco most foreigners are familiar with is a style that was developed as a spectacle for tourists. To add variety, group dances are included and even solos are more likely to be choreographed. The frilly, voluminous spotted dresses are derived from a style of dress worn for the Sevillanas at the annual Feria in Seville.

In traditional flamenco, only the very young or older dancers are considered to have the emotional innocence or maturity to adequately convey the &quot;duende&quot; (soul) of the genre . Therefore, unlike other dance forms, where dancers turn professional through techniques early on to take advantage of youth and strength, many flamenco dancers do not hit their peak until their thirties and will continue to perform into their fifties and beyond. One artist that is considered a young master is Juan Manuel Fernandez Montoya, otherwise known as &quot;Farruquito&quot;. At age 12, Farruquito was considered a pioneer and for &quot;Flamenco Puro&quot;, or &quot;Flamenco por Derecho&quot;, because of his emotional depth.

== Regulated teaching of flamenco in educational centers ==

In Spain, regulated flamenco studies are officially taught in various music conservatories, dance conservatories and music schools in various autonomous communities.

=== Conservatories of music ===

Flamenco guitar studies in official educational centers began in Spain in 1988 at the hands of the great concert performer and teacher from Granada Manuel Cano Tamayo, who obtained a position as emeritus professor at the Superior Conservatory de Música Rafael Orozco from Córdoba.

There are specialized flamenco conservatories throughout the country, although mainly in the Andalusia region, such as the aforementioned Córdoba Conservatory, the Murcia Superior Music Conservatory or the Superior Music School of Catalonia, among others. Outside of Spain, a unique case is the Rotterdam Conservatory, in the Netherlands, which offers regulated flamenco guitar studies under the direction of maestro Paco Peña since 1985, a few years before they existed in Spain.

== University ==
In 2018 the first university master&#x27;s degree in flamenco research and analysis begins, after the previous attempts of the &quot;Doctorate Program of Approach to Flamenco&quot;, taught by several universities such as Huelva, Seville, Cádiz and Córdoba, among others.

=== History ===
The fandango, which in the 17th century was the most widespread song and dance throughout Spain, eventually ended up generating local and regional variants, especially in the province of Huelva. In Alta Andalucía and bordering areas, the fandangos were accompanied with the bandola, an instrument with which they accompanied themselves following a regular beat that allowed dancing and from whose name the style derives &quot; abandoned &quot;. Thus arose the fandangos of Lucena, the drones of Puente Genil, the primitive malagueñas, the rondeñas, the jaberas, the jabegotes, the verdiales, the chacarrá, the granaína, the taranto and the taranta. Due to the expansion of the Sevillanas in Baja Andalusia, the fandango gradually lost its role as a support for the dance, which allowed the singer to shine and freedom, generating a multitude of fandangos of personal creation in the 20th century. Likewise, thousands of Andalusian peasants, especially from the Eastern Andalusian provinces, emigrated to the mining sites Murcian, where the tarantos and taranta s evolved. The Tarante de Linares, evolved into the mining of the Union, the Cartagena and the Levantica. At the time of the cafés cantantes, some of these cantes were separated from the dance and acquired a free beat, which allowed the performers to show off. The great promoter of this process was Antonio Chacón, who developed precious versions of malagueñas, granainas and cantes mineros.

The stylization of romance and cord sheets gave rise to . The extraction of the romances from quatrains or three significant verses gave rise to the primitive tonás, the caña and the polo, which share meter and melody, but differing in their execution. The guitar accompaniment gave them a beat that made them danceable. It is believed that their origin was in Ronda, a city in Alta Andalucía close to Baja Andalucía and closely related to it, and that from there they reached the Sevillian suburb of Triana, with a great tradition of corridos, where they became the soleá. From the festive performance of corridos and soleares, the jaleos arose in Triana, who traveled to Extremadura and in Jerez and Utrera led to the bulería, from where they spread throughout Baja Andalucía, generating local variations.

== Lexicon ==

=== Ole ===
Adolfo Salazar states that the expressive voice &quot;ole&quot;, with which Andalusian &quot;cantaores&quot; and &quot;bailaores&quot; are encouraged, can come from the Hebrew verb &quot;oleh&quot; which means &quot;to throw upwards&quot;, showing that the dervish girovaghi of Tunisia, Maghreb, also dance around to the sound of repeated &quot;ole&quot; or &quot;joleh&quot;. The use of the word &quot;arza&quot;, which is the Andalusian dialect form, of pronouncing the voice imperative &quot;rise&quot;, with the characteristic Andalusian equalization of / l / and / r / implosives. The indiscriminate use of the voices &quot;arza&quot; and &quot;ole&quot; is frequent when it comes to &quot;jalear&quot;, but the most evidence of the origin of this word can be from the caló: &quot;Olá&quot;, which means &quot;come&quot;. Likewise, in Andalusia it is known as jaleo al ojeo de hunt, that is, the act of glancing, which is &quot;driving away the game with voices, shots, blows or noise, so that they &#x27;get up.

=== Duende ===
According to the RAE dictionary (1956!) The &quot;duende&quot; in Andalusia is a &quot;mysterious and ineffable charm&quot;, a charisma that the Gitanos call duende. Federico García Lorca, in his lecture &quot;Teoría y juego del duende&quot; confirms this ineffability of the duende by defining it with the following words from Goethe: &quot;Mysterious power that everyone feels and that no philosopher explains&quot;. In the flamenco imaginary, the duende goes beyond technique and inspiration, in Lorca&#x27;s words &quot;To search for the duende there is no map or exercise&quot;. When a flamenco artist experiences the arrival of this mysterious charm, the expressions &quot;have duende&quot; or sing, play or dance &quot;with duende&quot; are used.

Along with those previously mentioned, there are many other words and expressions characteristic of the flamenco genre, such as &quot;tablao flamenco&quot;, &quot;flamenco spree&quot;, &quot;third&quot;, &quot;aflamencar&quot;, and &quot;flamenco&quot;.

<text>Father Christmas is the traditional English name for the personification of Christmas. Although now known as a Christmas gift-bringer, and typically considered to be synonymous with Santa Claus, he was originally part of a much older and unrelated English folkloric tradition. The recognisably modern figure of the English Father Christmas developed in the late Victorian period, but Christmas had been personified for centuries before then.

English personifications of Christmas were first recorded in the 15th century, with Father Christmas himself first appearing in the mid 17th century in the aftermath of the English Civil War. The Puritan-controlled English government had legislated to abolish Christmas, considering it popish, and had outlawed its traditional customs. Royalist political pamphleteers, linking the old traditions with their cause, adopted Old Father Christmas as the symbol of &#x27;the good old days&#x27; of feasting and good cheer. Following the Restoration in 1660, Father Christmas&#x27;s profile declined. His character was maintained during the late 18th and into the 19th century by the Christmas folk plays later known as mummers&#x27; plays.

Until Victorian times, Father Christmas was concerned with adult feasting and merry-making. He had no particular connection with children, nor with the giving of presents, nocturnal visits, stockings, chimneys or reindeer. But as later Victorian Christmases developed into child-centric family festivals, Father Christmas became a bringer of gifts. 

The popular American myth of Santa Claus arrived in England in the 1850s and Father Christmas started to take on Santa Claus&#x27;s attributes. By the 1880s the new customs had become established, with the nocturnal visitor sometimes being known as Santa Claus and sometimes as Father Christmas. He was often illustrated wearing a long red hooded gown trimmed with white fur.

Most residual distinctions between Father Christmas and Santa Claus largely faded away in the early years of the 20th century, and modern dictionaries consider the terms Father Christmas and Santa Claus to be synonymous.

==Early midwinter celebrations==

The custom of merrymaking and feasting at Christmastide first appears in the historical record during the High Middle Ages (c 1100–1300). This almost certainly represented a continuation of pre-Christian midwinter celebrations in Britain of which—as the historian Ronald Hutton has pointed out—&quot;we have no details at all&quot;. Personifications came later, and when they did they reflected the existing custom.

==15th century—the first English personifications of Christmas==

The first known English personification of Christmas was associated with merry-making, singing and drinking. A carol attributed to Richard Smart, Rector of Plymtree in Devon from 1435 to 1477, has &#x27;Sir Christemas&#x27; announcing the news of Christ&#x27;s birth and encouraging his listeners to drink: &quot;&quot;Buvez bien par toute la compagnie&quot;, / Make good cheer and be right merry, / And sing with us now joyfully: Nowell, nowell.&quot;

Many Christmas customs of the Late Middle Ages incorporated both sacred and secular themes. In Norwich in January 1443, at a traditional battle between the flesh and the spirit (represented by Christmas and Lent), John Gladman, crowned and disguised as &#x27;King of Christmas&#x27;, rode behind a pageant of the months &quot;disguysed as the seson requird&quot; on a horse decorated with tinfoil.

==16th century—feasting, entertainment and music==

In most of England the archaic word &#x27;Yule&#x27; had been replaced by &#x27;Christmas&#x27; by the 11th century, but in some places &#x27;Yule&#x27; survived as the normal dialect term. The City of York maintained an annual St Thomas&#x27;s Day celebration of &quot;The Riding of Yule and his Wife&quot; which involved a figure representing Yule who carried bread and a leg of lamb. In 1572, the riding was suppressed on the orders of Edmund Grindal, the Archbishop of York (term 1570–1576), who complained of the &quot;undecent and uncomely disguising&quot; which drew multitudes of people from divine service.

Such personifications, illustrating the medieval fondness for pageantry and symbolism, extended throughout the Tudor and Stuart periods with Lord of Misrule characters, sometimes called &#x27;Captain Christmas&#x27;, &#x27;Prince Christmas&#x27; or &#x27;The Christmas Lord&#x27;, presiding over feasting and entertainment in grand houses, university colleges and Inns of Court.

In his allegorical play &quot;Summer&#x27;s Last Will and Testament&quot;, written in about 1592, Thomas Nashe introduced for comic effect a miserly Christmas character who refuses to keep the feast. He is reminded by Summer of the traditional role that he ought to be playing: &quot;Christmas, how chance thou com’st not as the rest, / Accompanied with some music, or some song? / A merry carol would have graced thee well; / Thy ancestors have used it heretofore.&quot;

==17th century—religion and politics==

===Puritan criticisms===

Early 17th century writers used the techniques of personification and allegory as a means of defending Christmas from attacks by radical Protestants.

Responding to a perceived decline in the levels of Christmas hospitality provided by the gentry, Ben Jonson in &quot;Christmas, His Masque&quot; (1616) dressed his Old Christmas in out-of-date fashions: &quot;attir&#x27;d in round Hose, long Stockings, a close Doublet, a high crownd Hat with a Broach, a long thin beard, a Truncheon, little Ruffes, white shoes, his Scarffes, and Garters tyed crosse&quot;. Surrounded by guards, Christmas asserts his rightful place in the Protestant Church and protests against attempts to exclude him: &quot;Why Gentlemen, doe you know what you doe? ha! would you ha&#x27;kept me out? Christmas, old Christmas? Christmas of London, and Captaine Christmas? ... they would not let me in: I must come another time! a good jeast, as if I could come more then once a yeare; why, I am no dangerous person, and so I told my friends, o&#x27;the Guard. I am old Gregorie Christmas still, and though I come out of Popes-head-alley as good a Protestant, as any i&#x27;my Parish.&quot;

The stage directions to &quot;The Springs Glorie&quot;, a 1638 court masque by Thomas Nabbes, state, &quot;Christmas is personated by an old reverend Gentleman in a furr&#x27;d gown and cappe &amp;c.&quot; Shrovetide and Christmas dispute precedence, and Shrovetide issues a challenge: &quot;I say Christmas you are past date, you are out of the Almanack. Resigne, resigne.&quot; To which Christmas responds: &quot;Resigne to thee! I that am the King of good cheere and feasting, though I come but once a yeare to raigne over bak&#x27;t, boyled, roast and plum-porridge, will have being in despight of thy lard-ship.&quot;

This sort of character was to feature repeatedly over the next 250 years in pictures, stage plays and folk dramas. Initially known as &#x27;Sir Christmas&#x27; or &#x27;Lord Christmas&#x27;, he later became increasingly referred to as &#x27;Father Christmas&#x27;.

===Puritan revolution—enter &#x27;Father Christmas&#x27;===
The rise of puritanism led to accusations of popery in connection with pre-reformation Christmas traditions. When the Puritans took control of government in the mid-1640s they made concerted efforts to abolish Christmas and to outlaw its traditional customs. For 15 years from around 1644, before and during the Interregnum of 1649-1660, the celebration of Christmas in England was forbidden. The suppression was given greater legal weight from June 1647 when parliament passed an &quot;Ordinance for Abolishing of Festivals&quot; which formally abolished Christmas in its entirety, along with the other traditional church festivals of Easter and Whitsun.

It was in this context that Royalist pamphleteers linked the old traditions of Christmas with the cause of King and Church, while radical puritans argued for the suppression of Christmas both in its religious and its secular aspects. In the hands of Royalist pamphlet writers, Old Father Christmas served as the symbol and spokesman of &#x27;the good old days&#x27; of feasting and good cheer, and it became popular for Christmastide&#x27;s defenders to present him as lamenting past times.

&quot;The Arraignment, Conviction and Imprisoning of Christmas&quot; (January 1646) describes a discussion between a town crier and a Royalist gentlewoman enquiring after Old Father Christmas who &#x27;is gone from hence&#x27;. Its anonymous author, a parliamentarian, presents Father Christmas in a negative light, concentrating on his allegedly popish attributes: &quot;For age, this hoarie headed man was of great yeares, and as white as snow; he entred the Romish Kallender time out of mind; [he] is old ...; he was full and fat as any dumb Docter of them all. He looked under the consecrated Laune sleeves as big as Bul-beefe ... but, since the catholike liquor is taken from him, he is much wasted, so that he hath looked very thin and ill of late ... But yet some other markes that you may know him by, is that the wanton Women dote after him; he helped them to so many new Gownes, Hatts, and Hankerches, and other fine knacks, of which he hath a pack on his back, in which is good store of all sorts, besides the fine knacks that he got out of their husbands&#x27; pockets for household provisions for him. He got Prentises, Servants, and Schollars many play dayes, and therefore was well beloved by them also, and made all merry with Bagpipes, Fiddles, and other musicks, Giggs, Dances, and Mummings.&quot;
The character of &#x27;Christmas&#x27; (also called &#x27;father Christmas&#x27;) speaks in a pamphlet of 1652, immediately after the English Civil War, published anonymously by the satirical Royalist poet John Taylor: &quot;The Vindication of Christmas or, His Twelve Yeares&#x27; Observations upon the Times&quot;. A frontispiece illustrates an old, bearded Christmas in a brimmed hat, a long open robe and undersleeves. Christmas laments the pitiful quandary he has fallen into since he came into &quot;this headlesse countrey&quot;. &quot;I was in good hope that so long a misery would have made them glad to bid a merry Christmas welcome. But welcome or not welcome, I am come...&quot; He concludes with a verse: &quot;Lets dance and sing, and make good chear, / For Christmas comes but once a year.&quot;
In 1658 Josiah King published &quot;The Examination and Tryall of Old Father Christmas&quot; (the earliest citation for the specific term &#x27;Father Christmas&#x27; recognised by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;). King portrays Father Christmas as a white-haired old man who is on trial for his life based on evidence laid against him by the Commonwealth. Father Christmas&#x27;s counsel mounts the defence: &quot;Me thinks my Lord, the very Clouds blush, to see this old Gentleman thus egregiously abused. if at any time any have abused themselves by immoderate eating, and drinking or otherwise spoil the creatures, it is none of this old mans fault; neither ought he to suffer for it; for example the Sun and the Moon are by the heathens worship’d are they therefore bad because idolized? so if any abuse this old man, they are bad for abusing him, not he bad, for being abused.&quot; The jury acquits.

===Restoration===

Following the Restoration in 1660, most traditional Christmas celebrations were revived, although as these were no longer contentious the historic documentary sources become fewer.

In 1678 Josiah King reprinted his 1658 pamphlet with additional material. In this version, the restored Father Christmas is looking better: &quot;[he] look&#x27;t so smug and pleasant, his cherry cheeks appeared through his thin milk white locks, like [b]lushing Roses vail&#x27;d with snow white Tiffany ... the true Emblem of Joy and Innocence.&quot;

&quot;Old Christmass Returnd&quot;, a ballad collected by Samuel Pepys, celebrated the revival of festivities in the latter part of the century: &quot;Old Christmass is come for to keep open house / He scorns to be guilty of starving a mouse, / Then come boyes and welcome, for dyet the chief / Plumb pudding, Goose, Capon, minc&#x27;t pies &amp; Roast beef&quot;.

== 18th century—a low profile ==

As interest in Christmas customs waned, Father Christmas&#x27;s profile declined. He still continued to be regarded as Christmas&#x27;s presiding spirit, although his occasional earlier associations with the Lord of Misrule died out with the disappearance of the Lord of Misrule himself. The historian Ronald Hutton notes, &quot;after a taste of genuine misrule during the Interregnum nobody in the ruling elite seems to have had any stomach for simulating it.&quot; Hutton also found &quot;patterns of entertainment at late Stuart Christmases are remarkably timeless [and] nothing very much seems to have altered during the next century either.&quot; The diaries of 18th and early 19th century clergy take little note of any Christmas traditions.

In &quot;The Country Squire&quot;, a play of 1732, Old Christmas is depicted as someone who is rarely-found: a generous squire. The character Scabbard remarks, &quot;Men are grown so ... stingy, now-a-days, that there is scarce One, in ten Parishes, makes any House-keeping. ... Squire Christmas ... keeps a good House, or else I do not know of One besides.&quot; When invited to spend Christmas with the squire, he comments &quot;I will ... else I shall forget Christmas, for aught I see.&quot; Similar opinions were expressed in &quot;Round About Our Coal Fire ... with some curious Memories of Old Father Christmas; Shewing what Hospitality was in former Times, and how little there remains of it at present&quot; (1734, reprinted with Father Christmas subtitle 1796).

David Garrick&#x27;s popular 1774 Drury Lane production of &quot;A Christmas Tale&quot; included a personified Christmas character who announced &quot;Behold a personage well known to fame; / Once lov&#x27;d and honour&#x27;d – Christmas is my name! /.../ I, English hearts rejoic&#x27;d in days of yore; / for new strange modes, imported by the score, / You will not sure turn Christmas out of door!&quot;

===Early records of folk plays===

By the late 18th century Father Christmas had become a stock character in the Christmas folk plays later known as mummers plays. During the following century they became probably the most widespread of all calendar customs. Hundreds of villages had their own mummers who performed traditional plays around the neighbourhood, especially at the big houses. Father Christmas appears as a character in plays of the Southern England type, being mostly confined to plays from the south and west of England and Wales. His ritual opening speech is characterised by variants of a couplet closely reminiscent of John Taylor&#x27;s &quot;But welcome or not welcome, I am come...&quot; from 1652.

The oldest extant speech is from Truro, Cornwall in the late 1780s:

== 19th century—revival ==

During the Victorian period, Christmas customs enjoyed a significant revival, including the figure of Father Christmas himself as the emblem of &#x27;good cheer&#x27;. His physical appearance at this time became more variable, and he was by no means always portrayed as the old and bearded figure imagined by 17th century writers.

===&#x27;Merry England&#x27; view of Christmas===
In his 1808 poem &quot;Marmion&quot;, Walter Scott wrote:
:&quot;England was merry England, when / Old Christmas brought his sports again.
:&#x27;Twas Christmas broach&#x27;d the mightiest ale; / &#x27;Twas Christmas told the merriest tale;
:A Christmas gambol oft could cheer / The poor man&#x27;s heart through half the year.&quot;
Scott&#x27;s phrase Merry England has been adopted by historians to describe the romantic notion that there was a Golden Age of the English past, allegedly since lost, that was characterised by universal hospitality and charity. The notion had a profound influence on the way that popular customs were seen, and most of the 19th century writers who bemoaned the state of contemporary Christmases were, at least to some extent, yearning for the mythical Merry England version.
Thomas Hervey&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Christmas&quot; (1836), illustrated by Robert Seymour, exemplifies this view. In Hervey&#x27;s personification of the lost charitable festival, &quot;Old Father Christmas, at the head of his numerous and uproarious family, might ride his goat through the streets of the city and the lanes of the village, but he dismounted to sit for some few moments by each man&#x27;s hearth; while some one or another of his merry sons would break away, to visit the remote farm-houses or show their laughing faces at many a poor man&#x27;s door.&quot; Seymour&#x27;s illustration shows Old Christmas dressed in a fur gown, crowned with a holly wreath, and riding a yule goat.
In an extended allegory, Hervey imagines his contemporary Old Father Christmas as a white-bearded magician dressed in a long robe and crowned with holly. His children are identified as Roast Beef (Sir Loin) and his faithful squire or bottle-holder Plum Pudding; the slender figure of Wassail with her fount of perpetual youth; a &#x27;tricksy spirit&#x27; who bears the bowl and is on the best of terms with the Turkey; Mumming; Misrule, with a feather in his cap; the Lord of Twelfth Night under a state-canopy of cake and wearing his ancient crown; Saint Distaff looking like an old maid (&quot;she used to be a sad romp; but her merriest days we fear are over&quot;); Carol singing; the Waits; and the twin-faced Janus.

Hervey ends by lamenting the lost &quot;uproarious merriment&quot; of Christmas, and calls on his readers &quot;who know anything of the &#x27;old, old, very old, gray-bearded gentleman&#x27; or his family to aid us in our search after them; and with their good help we will endeavor to restore them to some portion of their ancient honors in England&quot;.

Father Christmas or Old Christmas, represented as a jolly-faced bearded man often surrounded by plentiful food and drink, started to appear regularly in illustrated magazines of the 1840s. He was dressed in a variety of costumes and usually had holly on his head, as in these illustrations from the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;:


Charles Dickens&#x27;s 1843 novel &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; was highly influential, and has been credited both with reviving interest in Christmas in England and with shaping the themes attached to it. A famous image from the novel is John Leech&#x27;s illustration of the &#x27;Ghost of Christmas Present&#x27;. Although not explicitly named Father Christmas, the character wears a holly wreath, is shown sitting among food, drink and wassail bowl, and is dressed in the traditional loose furred gown—but in green rather than the red that later become ubiquitous.

===Later 19th century mumming===

Old Father Christmas continued to make his annual appearance in Christmas folk plays throughout the 19th century, his appearance varying considerably according to local custom. Sometimes, as in Hervey&#x27;s book of 1836, he was portrayed (below left) as a hunchback.

One unusual portrayal (below centre) was described several times by William Sandys between 1830 and 1852, all in essentially the same terms: &quot;Father Christmas is represented as a grotesque old man, with a large mask and comic wig, and a huge club in his hand.&quot; This representation is considered by the folklore scholar Peter Millington to be the result of the southern Father Christmas replacing the northern Beelzebub character in a hybrid play. A spectator to a Worcestershire version of the &quot;St George&quot; play in 1856 noted, &quot;Beelzebub was identical with Old Father Christmas.&quot;

A mummers play mentioned in &quot;The Book of Days&quot; (1864) opened with &quot;Old Father Christmas, bearing, as emblematic devices, the holly bough, wassail-bowl, &amp;c&quot;. A corresponding illustration (below right) shows the character wearing not only a holly wreath but also a gown with a hood.

In a Hampshire folk play of 1860 Father Christmas is portrayed as a disabled soldier: &quot;[he] wore breeches and stockings, carried a begging-box, and conveyed himself upon two sticks; his arms were striped with chevrons like a noncommissioned officer.&quot;

In the latter part of the 19th century and the early years of the next the folk play tradition in England rapidly faded, and the plays almost died out after the First World War taking their ability to influence the character of Father Christmas with them.

===Father Christmas as gift-giver===

In pre-Victorian personifications, Father Christmas had been concerned essentially with adult feasting and games. He had no particular connection with children, nor with the giving of presents. But as Victorian Christmases developed into family festivals centred mainly on children, Father Christmas started to be associated with the giving of gifts.

The Cornish Quaker diarist Barclay Fox relates a family party given on 26 December 1842 that featured &quot;the venerable effigies of Father Christmas with scarlet coat &amp; cocked hat, stuck all over with presents for the guests, by his side the old year, a most dismal &amp; haggard old beldame in a night cap and spectacles, then 1843 [the new year], a promising baby asleep in a cradle&quot;.

In Britain, the first evidence of a child writing letters to Father Christmas requesting gift has been found in 1895.

===Santa Claus crosses the Atlantic===

The figure of Santa Claus had originated in the US, drawing at least partly upon Dutch St Nicolas traditions. A New York publication of 1821, &quot;A New-Year’s Present&quot;, contained an illustrated poem &quot;Old Santeclaus with Much Delight&quot; in which a Santa Claus figure on a reindeer sleigh brings presents for good children and a &quot;long, black birchen rod&quot; for use on the bad ones. In 1823 came the famous poem &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot;, usually attributed to the New York writer Clement Clarke Moore, which developed the character further. Moore&#x27;s poem became immensely popular and Santa Claus customs, initially localized in the Dutch American areas, were becoming general in the United States by the middle of the century.
The January 1848 edition of &quot;Howitt&#x27;s Journal of Literature and Popular Progress&quot;, published in London, carried an illustrated article entitled &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve in Different Nations&quot;. This noted that one of the chief features of the American New Year&#x27;s Eve was a custom carried over from the Dutch, namely the arrival of Santa Claus with gifts for the children. Santa Claus is &quot;no other than the Pelz Nickel of Germany ... the good Saint Nicholas of Russia ... He arrives in Germany about a fortnight before Christmas, but as may be supposed from all the visits he has to pay there, and the length of his voyage, he does not arrive in America, until this eve.&quot;

In 1851 advertisements began appearing in Liverpool newspapers for a new transatlantic passenger service to and from New York aboard the Eagle Line&#x27;s ship &quot;Santa Claus&quot;, and returning visitors and emigrants to the British Isles on this and other vessels will have been familiar with the American figure. There were some early adoptions in Britain. A Scottish reference has Santa Claus leaving presents on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1852, with children &quot;hanging their stockings up on each side of the fire-place, in their sleeping apartments, at night, and waiting patiently till morning, to see what Santa Claus puts into them during their slumbers&quot;. In Ireland in 1853, on the other hand, presents were being left on Christmas Eve according to a character in a newspaper short story who says &quot;... tomorrow will be Christmas. What will Santa Claus bring us?&quot; A poem published in Belfast in 1858 includes the lines &quot;The children sleep; they dream of him, the fairy, / Kind Santa Claus, who with a right good will / Comes down the chimney with a footstep airy ...&quot;

&quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot; was published in England in December 1853 in &quot;Notes and Queries&quot;. An explanatory note states that the St Nicholas figure is known as Santa Claus in New York State and as Krishkinkle in Pennsylvania.

1854 marked the first English publication of &quot;Carl Krinkin; or, The Christmas Stocking&quot; by the popular American author Susan Warner. The novel was published three times in London in 1854–5, and there were several later editions. Characters in the book include both Santa Claus (complete with sleigh, stocking and chimney), leaving presents on Christmas Eve and—separately—Old Father Christmas. The Stocking of the title tells of how in England, &quot;a great many years ago&quot;, it saw Father Christmas enter with his traditional refrain &quot;Oh! here come I, old father Christmas, welcome or not ...&quot; He wore a crown of yew and ivy, and he carried a long staff topped with holly-berries. His dress &quot;was a long brown robe which fell down about his feet, and on it were sewed little spots of white cloth to represent snow&quot;.

===Merger with Santa Claus===

As the US-inspired customs became popular in England, Father Christmas started to take on Santa Claus&#x27;s attributes. His costume became more standardised, and although depictions often still showed him carrying holly, the holly crown became rarer and was often replaced with a hood. It still remained common, though, for Father Christmas and Santa Claus to be distinguished, and as late as the 1890s there were still examples of the old-style Father Christmas appearing without any of the new American features.

====Appearances in public====

The blurring of public roles occurred quite rapidly. In an 1854 newspaper description of the public Boxing Day festivities in Luton, Bedfordshire, a gift-giving Father Christmas/Santa Claus figure was already being described as &#x27;familiar&#x27;: &quot;On the right-hand side was Father Christmas&#x27;s bower, formed of evergreens, and in front was the proverbial Yule log, glistening in the snow ... He wore a great furry white coat and cap, and a long white beard and hair spoke to his hoar antiquity. Behind his bower he had a large selection of fancy articles which formed the gifts he distributed to holders of prize tickets from time to time during the day ... Father Christmas bore in his hand a small Christmas tree laden with bright little gifts and bon-bons, and altogether he looked like the familiar Santa Claus or Father Christmas of the picture book.&quot; Discussing the shops of Regent Street in London, another writer noted in December of that year, &quot;you may fancy yourself in the abode of Father Christmas or St. Nicholas himself.&quot;

During the 1860s and the 1870s, Father Christmas became a popular subject on Christmas cards, where he was shown in many different costumes. Sometimes he gave presents and sometimes received them.
An illustrated article of 1866 explained the concept of &quot;The Cave of Mystery&quot;. In an imagined children&#x27;s party this took the form of a recess in the library which evoked &quot;dim visions of the cave of Aladdin&quot; and was &quot;well filled ... with all that delights the eye, pleases the ear, or tickles the fancy of children&quot;. The young guests &quot;tremblingly await the decision of the improvised Father Christmas, with his flowing grey beard, long robe, and slender staff&quot;.
From the 1870s onwards, Christmas shopping had begun to evolve as a separate seasonal activity, and by the late 19th century it had become an important part of the English Christmas. The purchasing of toys, especially from the new department stores, became strongly associated with the season. The first retail Christmas Grotto was set up in JR Robert&#x27;s store in Stratford, London in December 1888, and shopping arenas for children—often called &#x27;Christmas Bazaars&#x27;—spread rapidly during the 1890s and 1900s, helping to assimilate Father Christmas/Santa Claus into society.

Sometimes the two characters continued to be presented as separate, as in a procession at the Olympia Exhibition of 1888 in which both Father Christmas and Santa Claus took part, with Little Red Riding Hood and other children&#x27;s characters in between. At other times the characters were conflated: in 1885 Mr Williamson&#x27;s London Bazaar in Sunderland was reported to be a &quot;Temple of juvenile delectation and delight. In the well-lighted window is a representation of Father Christmas, with the printed intimation that &#x27;Santa Claus is arranging within.&#x27;&quot;

Even after the appearance of the store grotto, it was still not firmly established who should hand out gifts at parties. A writer in the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; of December 1888 suggested that a Sibyl should dispense gifts from a &#x27;snow cave&#x27;, but a little over a year later she had changed her recommendation to a gypsy in a &#x27;magic cave&#x27;. Alternatively, the hostess could &quot;have Father Christmas arrive, towards the end of the evening, with a sack of toys on his back. He must have a white head and a long white beard, of course. Wig and beard can be cheaply hired from a theatrical costumier, or may be improvised from tow in case of need. He should wear a greatcoat down to his heels, liberally sprinkled with flour as though he had just come from that land of ice where Father Christmas is supposed to reside.&quot;

====As secret nocturnal visitor====

The nocturnal visitor aspect of the American myth took much longer to become naturalised. From the 1840s it had been accepted readily enough that presents were left for children by unseen hands overnight on Christmas Eve, but the receptacle was a matter of debate, as was the nature of the visitor. Dutch tradition had St Nicholas leaving presents in shoes laid out on 5 December, while in France shoes were filled by Père Noël. The older shoe custom and the newer American stocking custom trickled only slowly into Britain, with writers and illustrators remaining uncertain for many years. Although the stocking eventually triumphed, the shoe custom had still not been forgotten by 1901 when an illustration entitled &quot;Did you see Santa Claus, Mother?&quot; was accompanied by the verse &quot;Her Christmas dreams / Have all come true; / Stocking o&#x27;erflows / and likewise shoe.&quot;
Before Santa Claus and the stocking became ubiquitous, one English tradition had been for fairies to visit on Christmas Eve to leave gifts in shoes set out in front of the fireplace.

Aspects of the American Santa Claus myth were sometimes adopted in isolation and applied to Father Christmas. In a short fantasy piece, the editor of the &quot;Cheltenham Chronicle&quot; in 1867 dreamt of being seized by the collar by Father Christmas, &quot;rising up like a Geni of the Arabian Nights ... and moving rapidly through the &quot;aether&quot;&quot;. Hovering over the roof of a house, Father Christmas cries &#x27;Open Sesame&#x27; to have the roof roll back to disclose the scene within.

It was not until the 1870s that the tradition of a nocturnal Santa Claus began to be adopted by ordinary people. The poem &quot;The Baby&#x27;s Stocking&quot;, which was syndicated to local newspapers in 1871, took it for granted that readers would be familiar with the custom, and would understand the joke that the stocking might be missed as &quot;Santa Claus wouldn&#x27;t be looking for anything half so small.&quot; On the other hand, when &quot;The Preston Guardian&quot; published its poem &quot;Santa Claus and the Children&quot; in 1877 it felt the need to include a long preface explaining exactly who Santa Claus was.

Folklorists and antiquarians were not, it seems, familiar with the new local customs and Ronald Hutton notes that in 1879 the newly formed Folk-Lore Society, ignorant of American practices, was still &quot;excitedly trying to discover the source of the new belief&quot;.

In January 1879 the antiquarian Edwin Lees wrote to &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; seeking information about an observance he had been told about by &#x27;a country person&#x27;: &quot;On Christmas Eve, when the inmates of a house in the country retire to bed, all those desirous of a present place a stocking outside the door of their bedroom, with the expectation that some mythical being called Santiclaus will fill the stocking or place something within it before the morning. This is of course well known, and the master of the house does in reality place a Christmas gift secretly in each stocking; but the giggling girls in the morning, when bringing down their presents, affect to say that Santiclaus visited and filled the stockings in the night. From what region of the earth or air this benevolent Santiclaus takes flight I have not been able to ascertain ...&quot; Lees received several responses, linking &#x27;Santiclaus&#x27; with the continental traditions of St Nicholas and &#x27;Petit Jesus&#x27; (Christkind), but no-one mentioned Father Christmas and no-one was correctly able to identify the American source.

By the 1880s the American myth had become firmly established in the popular English imagination, the nocturnal visitor sometimes being known as Santa Claus and sometimes as Father Christmas (often complete with a hooded robe). An 1881 poem imagined a child awaiting a visit from Santa Claus and asking &quot;Will he come like Father Christmas, / Robed in green and beard all white? / Will he come amid the darkness? / Will he come at all tonight?&quot; The French writer Max O&#x27;Rell, who evidently thought the custom was established in the England of 1883, explained that Father Christmas &quot;descend par la cheminée, pour remplir de bonbons et de joux les bas que les enfants ont suspendus au pied du lit.&quot; [comes down the chimney, to fill with sweets and games the stockings that the children have hung from the foot of the bed]. And in her poem &quot;Agnes: A Fairy Tale&quot; (1891), Lilian M Bennett treats the two names as interchangeable: &quot;Old Santa Claus is exceedingly kind, / but he won&#x27;t come to Wide-awakes, you will find... / Father Christmas won&#x27;t come if he can hear / You&#x27;re awake. So to bed my bairnies dear.&quot; The commercial availability from 1895 of Tom Smith &amp; Co&#x27;s &quot;Santa Claus Surprise Stockings&quot; indicates how deeply the American myth had penetrated English society by the end of the century.

Representations of the developing character at this period were sometimes labelled &#x27;Santa Claus&#x27; and sometimes &#x27;Father Christmas&#x27;, with a tendency for the latter still to allude to old-style associations with charity and with food and drink, as in several of these &quot;Punch&quot; illustrations:

==20th century==
Any residual distinctions between Father Christmas and Santa Claus largely faded away in the early years of the new century, and it was reported in 1915, &quot;The majority of children to-day ... do not know of any difference between our old Father Christmas and the comparatively new Santa Claus, as, by both wearing the same garb, they have effected a happy compromise.&quot;

It took many years for authors and illustrators to agree that Father Christmas&#x27;s costume should be portrayed as red—although that was always the most common colour—and he could sometimes be found in a gown of brown, green, blue or white. Mass media approval of the red costume came following a Coca-Cola advertising campaign that was launched in 1931.

Father Christmas&#x27;s common form for much of the 20th century was described by his entry in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. He is &quot;the personification of Christmas as a benevolent old man with a flowing white beard, wearing a red sleeved gown and hood trimmed with white fur, and carrying a sack of Christmas presents&quot;. One of the OED&#x27;s sources is a 1919 cartoon in &quot;Punch&quot;, reproduced here. The caption reads:

:&quot;Uncle James (who after hours of making up rather fancies himself as Father Christmas)&quot;. &quot;Well, my little man, and do you know who I am?&quot;
:&quot;The Little Man.&quot; &quot;No, as a matter of fact I don&#x27;t. But Father&#x27;s downstairs; perhaps he may be able to tell you.&quot;

In 1951 an editorial in &quot;The Times&quot; opined that while most adults may be under the impression that [the English] Father Christmas is home-bred, and is &quot;a good insular John Bull old gentleman&quot;, many children, &quot;led away ... by the false romanticism of sledges and reindeer&quot;, post letters to Norway addressed simply to Father Christmas or, &quot;giving him a foreign veneer, Santa Claus&quot;.

Differences between the English and US representations were discussed in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; of 1985. The classic illustration by the US artist Thomas Nast was held to be &quot;the authorised version of how Santa Claus should look—in America, that is.&quot; In Britain, people were said to stick to the older Father Christmas, with a long robe, large concealing beard, and boots similar to Wellingtons.
Father Christmas appeared in many 20th century English-language works of fiction, including J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Father Christmas Letters&quot;, a series of private letters to his children written between 1920 and 1942 and first published in 1976. Other 20th century publications include C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; (1950), Raymond Briggs&#x27;s &quot;Father Christmas&quot; (1973) and its sequel &quot;Father Christmas Goes on Holiday&quot; (1975). The character was also celebrated in popular songs, including &quot;I Believe in Father Christmas&quot; by Greg Lake (1974) and &quot;Father Christmas&quot; by The Kinks (1977).

In 1991, Raymond Briggs&#x27;s two books were adapted as an animated short film, &quot;Father Christmas&quot;, starring Mel Smith as the voice of the title character.

==21st century==

Modern dictionaries consider the terms Father Christmas and Santa Claus to be synonymous. The respective characters are now to all intents and purposes indistinguishable, although some people are still said to prefer the term &#x27;Father Christmas&#x27; over &#x27;Santa Claus&#x27;, nearly 150 years after Santa Claus&#x27;s arrival in England. According to &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot; (19th edn, 2012), Father Christmas is considered to be &quot;[a] British rather than a US name for Santa Claus, associating him specifically with Christmas. The name carries a somewhat socially superior cachet and is thus preferred by certain advertisers.&quot;

<doc id="11563" wikidata="Q5440539" url="?curid=11563" title="Federal jurisdiction (United States)">
<text>Federal jurisdiction refers to the legal scope of the government&#x27;s powers in the United States of America.

The United States is a federal republic, governed by the U.S. Constitution, containing fifty states and a federal district which elect the President and Vice President, and having other territories and possessions in its national jurisdiction. This government is variously known as the Union, the United States, or the federal government.

Under the Constitution and various treaties, the legal jurisdiction of the United States includes territories and territorial waters.

== Legislative Branch ==

One aspect of federal jurisdiction is the extent of legislative power. Under the Constitution, Congress has power to legislate only in the areas that are delegated to it. Under clause 17 Article I Section 8 of the Constitution however, Congress has power to &quot;exercise exclusive Legislation in all cases whatsoever&quot; over the federal district (Washington, D.C.) and other territory ceded to the federal government by the states, such as for military installations.

Federal jurisdiction in this sense is important in criminal law because federal law does not supersede state criminal law. Congress has enacted the Assimilative Crimes Act (), which provides that any act that would have been a crime under the laws of the state in which a federal enclave is situated is also a federal crime. As most such enclaves are occupied by the military, military law is especially concerned with these enclaves, especially the issue of establishing who has jurisdiction and what type of jurisdiction. In such areas, the federal government may have proprietary jurisdiction (rights as landowner), concurrent jurisdiction (with federal and state law applicable), or exclusive jurisdiction over the land where an act was committed. Courts-martial involving military members subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice apply regardless of location.

Article Four of the United States Constitution also states that the Congress has the power to enact laws &quot;respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.&quot; Federal jurisdiction exists over any territory thus subject to laws enacted by the Congress.

== Judicial branch ==

The American legal system includes both state courts and federal courts. State courts hear cases involving state law, and such federal laws as are not restricted to hearing in federal courts. Federal courts may only hear cases where federal jurisdiction can be established. Specifically, the court must have both subject-matter jurisdiction over the matter of the claim and personal jurisdiction over the parties.

The Federal Courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, meaning that they only exercise powers granted to them by the Constitution and Federal Laws. There are several forms of subject-matter jurisdiction, but the two most commonly appealed to are federal-question jurisdiction and diversity jurisdiction. Federal question jurisdiction is available when the plaintiff raises a claim that arises under the laws, treaties, or Constitution of the United States, as opposed to claims arising under state law. By the &quot;Well-Pleaded Complaint&quot; rule, federal question jurisdiction is not available if the federal issue arises only as a defense to a state-law claim. Diversity jurisdiction, on the other hand, is available regarding state-law claims if every plaintiff is from a different state from every defendant (the requirement for so-called complete or total diversity) and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

If a Federal Court has subject matter jurisdiction over one or more of the claims in a case, it has discretion to exercise ancillary jurisdiction over other state law claims.

The Supreme Court has &quot;cautioned that ... Court[s] must take great care to &#x27;resist the temptation&#x27; to express preferences about [certain types of cases] in the form of jurisdictional rules. Judges must strain to remove the influence of the merits from their jurisdictional rules. The law of jurisdiction must remain apart from the world upon which it operates&quot;.

Generally, when a case has successfully overcome the hurdles of standing, Case or Controversy and State Action, it will be heard by a trial court. The non-governmental party may raise claims or defenses relating to alleged constitutional violation(s) by the government. If the non-governmental party loses, the constitutional issue may form part of the appeal. Eventually, a petition for certiorari may be sent to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court grants certiorari and accepts the case, it will receive written briefs from each side (and any amici curiae or friends of the court—usually interested third parties with some expertise to bear on the subject) and schedule oral arguments. The Justices will closely question both parties. When the Court renders its decision, it will generally do so in a single majority opinion and one or more dissenting opinions. Each opinion sets forth the facts, prior decisions, and legal reasoning behind the position taken. The majority opinion constitutes binding precedent on all lower courts; when faced with very similar facts, they are bound to apply the same reasoning or face reversal of their decision by a higher court.

<doc id="11569" wikidata="Q1141651" url="?curid=11569" title="Frequency modulation synthesis">
<text>Frequency modulation synthesis (or FM synthesis) is a form of sound synthesis whereby the frequency of a waveform is changed by modulating its frequency with a modulator. The (instantaneous) frequency of an oscillator is altered in accordance with the amplitude of a modulating signal.

FM synthesis can create both harmonic and inharmonic sounds. To synthesize harmonic sounds, the modulating signal must have a harmonic relationship to the original carrier signal. As the amount of frequency modulation increases, the sound grows progressively complex. Through the use of modulators with frequencies that are non-integer multiples of the carrier signal (i.e. inharmonic), inharmonic bell-like and percussive spectra can be created.

FM synthesis using analog oscillators may result in pitch instability. However, FM synthesis can also be implemented digitally, which is more stable and became standard practice.

== Applications ==
=== In synthesizers ===
Digital FM synthesis (equivalent to phase modulation using the time integration of instantaneous frequency) was the basis of several musical instruments beginning as early as 1974. Yamaha built the first prototype digital synthesizer in 1974, based on FM synthesis, before commercially releasing the Yamaha GS-1 in 1980. The Synclavier I, manufactured by New England Digital Corporation beginning in 1978, included a digital FM synthesizer, using an FM synthesis algorithm licensed from Yamaha. Yamaha&#x27;s groundbreaking Yamaha DX7 synthesizer, released in 1983, brought FM to the forefront of synthesis in the mid-1980s.

=== In PCs, arcades, game consoles, and mobile phones ===
FM synthesis also became the usual setting for games and software up until the mid-nineties. Sound cards for IBM PC compatible systems like the AdLib and Sound Blaster popularized Yamaha chips like the OPL2 and OPL3. Other computers such as the Sharp X68000 and MSX (Yamaha CX5M computer unit) utilize the OPM sound chip (with later CX5M units using the OPP sound chip). The NEC PC-88 and PC-98 computers use either the OPN and OPNA sound chips.

For arcade systems and game consoles, OPM was used in many arcade boards from the 1980s and 1990s (including Sega&#x27;s System 16 and Capcom&#x27;s CP System arcade boards); OPN was also used in some arcade boards in the 1980s. OPNB was notably used in SNK&#x27;s Neo Geo arcade (MVS) and home console (AES) machines, as well as being used as the main basic sound generator in Taito&#x27;s arcade boards (with a variant of the OPNB being used in the Taito Z System board). The related OPN2 was used in Sega&#x27;s Mega Drive (Genesis), Fujitsu&#x27;s FM Towns Marty, and some of Sega&#x27;s arcade boards (e.g. Sega System C-2 and Sega System 32) as one of its sound generator chips.

FM synthesis was also used on a wide range of mobile phones in the 2000s to play ringtones and other sounds, using the Yamaha SMAF format.

==History==

=== Don Buchla (mid-1960s) ===
Don Buchla implemented FM on his instruments in the mid-1960s, prior to Chowning&#x27;s patent. His 158, 258 and 259 dual oscillator modules had a specific FM control voltage input, and the model 208 (Music Easel) had a modulation oscillator hard-wired to allow FM as well as AM of the primary oscillator. These early applications used analog oscillators, and this capability was also followed by other modular synthesizers and portable synthesizers including Minimoog and ARP Odyssey.

=== John Chowning (late-1960s–1970s) ===
By the mid-20th century, frequency modulation (FM), a means of carrying sound, had been understood for decades and was being used to broadcast radio transmissions. FM synthesis was developed since 1967 at Stanford University, California, by John Chowning, . His was licensed to Japanese company Yamaha in 1973. The implementation commercialized by Yamaha (US Patent 4018121 Apr 1977 or U.S. Patent 4,018,121) , .

=== 1970s–1980s ===
==== Expansions by Yamaha ====
Yamaha&#x27;s engineers began adapting Chowning&#x27;s algorithm for use in a commercial digital synthesizer, adding improvements such as the &quot;key scaling&quot; method , though it would take several years before Yamaha released their FM digital synthesizers. In the 1970s, Yamaha were granted a number of patents, under the company&#x27;s former name &quot;Nippon Gakki Seizo Kabushiki Kaisha&quot;, evolving Chowning&#x27;s work. Yamaha built the first prototype FM digital synthesizer in 1974. Yamaha eventually commercialized FM synthesis technology with the Yamaha GS-1, the first FM digital synthesizer, released in 1980. FM synthesis was the basis of some of the early generations of digital synthesizers, most notably those from Yamaha, as well as New England Digital Corporation under license from Yamaha. 

Yamaha&#x27;s DX7 synthesizer, released in 1983, was ubiquitous throughout the 1980s. Several other models by Yamaha provided variations and evolutions of FM synthesis during that decade.

Yamaha had patented its hardware implementation of FM in the 1970s, allowing it to nearly monopolize the market for FM technology until the mid-1990s.

==== Related development by Casio ====
Casio developed a related form of synthesis called phase distortion synthesis, used in its CZ range of synthesizers. It had a similar (but slightly differently derived) sound quality to the DX series.

=== 1990s ===
==== Free use of FM after the patent expiration ====
With the expiration of the Stanford University FM patent in 1995, digital FM synthesis can now be implemented freely by other manufacturers. The FM synthesis patent brought Stanford $20 million before it expired, making it (in 1994) &quot;the second most lucrative licensing agreement in Stanford&#x27;s history&quot;.

Today, FM is mostly found in software-based synths such as Native Instruments&#x27; FM8 or Image-Line&#x27;s Sytrus plug-ins, but it has also been incorporated into the synthesis repertoire of some modern digital synthesizers, usually coexisting as an option alongside other methods of synthesis such as subtractive, sample-based synthesis, additive synthesis, and other techniques. The degree of complexity of the FM in such hardware synths may vary from simple 2-operator FM, to the highly flexible 6-operator engines of the Korg Kronos and Alesis Fusion, to creation of FM in extensively modular engines such as those in the latest synthesisers by Kurzweil Music Systems.

==== Later use of FM and other technologies: Realtime Convolution &amp; Modulation (AFM + Sample) and Formant Shaping Synthesis ====
The Yamaha SY99 and FS1R synthesizers marketed their highly powerful FM abilities as counterparts to sample-based synthesis and formant synthesis respectively. New hardware synths specifically marketed for their FM capabilities disappeared from the market after the release of FS1R in 1999, 

The FS1R had 16 operators, 8 standard FM operators and 8 additional operators that used a noise source rather than an oscillator as its sound source. By adding in tuneable noise sources the FS1R could model the sounds produced in the human voice and in a wind instrument, along with making percussion instrument sounds. The FS1R also contained an additional wave form called the Formant wave form. Formants can be used to model resonating body instrument sounds like the cello, violin, acoustic guitar, bassoon, English horn, or human voice. Formants can even be found in the harmonic spectrum of several brass instruments.

=== 2000s–present ===
==== Additional improvements: Variable Phase Modulation, FM-X Synthesis, Altered FM, etc. ====

In 2016, Korg released the Korg Volca FM, a, 3-voice, 6 operators FM iteration of the Korg Volca series of compact, affordable desktop modules. Korg has also released the opsix (2020) and opsix SE (2023), integrating 6 operators FM synthesis with subtractive, analogue modeling, additive, semi-modular and Waveshaping.

Yamaha released the Montage in 2016, which combines a 128-voice sample-based engine with a 128-voice FM engine. This iteration of FM is called FM-X, and features 8 operators; each operator has a choice of several basic wave forms, but each wave form has several parameters to adjust its spectrum. It was then followed by the more affordable Yamaha MODX in 2018, with 64-voice, 8 operators FM-X architecture in addition to a 128-voice sample-based engine. The MODX+ released in 2022 increased the number of voices of the FM-X engine to 128, the same as with the Montage. The Montage was succeeded by the Montage M in 2023, which uses the same 128-voice, 8 operators FM-X engine alongside a 128-voice sample-based engine and a newly-introduced 16-voice 3 oscillator analog-based engine known as AN-X.

Elektron launched the Digitone in 2018, which is an 8-voice, 4 operators FM synth featuring Elektron&#x27;s renowned sequence engine.

FM-X synthesis was first introduced with the Yamaha Montage synthesizers in 2016. FM-X uses 8 operators. Each FM-X operator has a set of multi-spectral wave forms to choose from, which means each FM-X operator can be equivalent to a stack of 3 or 4 DX7 FM operators. The list of selectable wave forms includes sine waves, the All1 and All2 wave forms, the Odd1 and Odd2 wave forms, and the Res1 and Res2 wave forms. The sine wave selection works the same as the DX7 wave forms. The All1 and All2 wave forms are a saw-tooth wave form. The Odd1 and Odd2 wave forms are pulse or square waves. These two types of wave forms can be used to model the basic harmonic peaks in the bottom of the harmonic spectrum of most instruments. The Res1 and Res2 wave forms move the spectral peak to a specific harmonic and can be used to model either triangular or rounded groups of harmonics further up in the spectrum of an instrument. Combining an All1 or Odd1 wave form with multiple Res1 (or Res2) wave forms (and adjusting their amplitudes) can model the harmonic spectrum of an instrument or sound. 

Combining sets of 8 FM operators with multi-spectral wave forms was first introduced in the FS1R, released in 1999 by Yamaha. It was able to achieve similar results to that of FM-X using 8 noise operators.

== Spectral analysis ==

There are multiple variations of FM synthesis, including:
*Various operator arrangements (known as &quot;FM Algorithms&quot; in Yamaha terminology)
**2 operators
**Serial FM (multiple stages)
**Parallel FM (multiple modulators, multiple-carriers),
**Mix of them
*Various waveform of operators
**Sinusoidal waveform
**Other waveforms
*Additional modulation
**Linear FM
**Exponential FM (preceded by the anti-logarithm conversion for CV/oct. interface of analog synthesizers)
**Oscillator sync with FM
&quot;etc&quot;.

As the basic of these variations, we analyze the spectrum of 2 operators (linear FM synthesis using two sinusoidal operators) on the following.

=== 2 operators ===
The spectrum generated by FM synthesis with one modulator is expressed as follows:

For modulation signal formula_1, the carrier signal is:
:formula_2

If we were to ignore the constant phase terms on the carrier formula_3 and the modulator formula_4, finally we would get the following expression, as seen on and :
:formula_5
where formula_6 are angular frequencies (formula_7) of carrier and modulator, formula_8 is frequency modulation index, and amplitudes formula_9 is formula_10-th Bessel function of first kind, respectively.

<doc id="11574" wikidata="Q75845" url="?curid=11574" title="Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel">
<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (; 22 July 1784 – 17 March 1846) was a German astronomer, mathematician, physicist, and geodesist. He was the first astronomer who determined reliable values for the distance from the sun to another star by the method of parallax. Certain important mathematical functions were first studied systematically by Bessel and were named Bessel functions in his honour.

== Life and family ==
Bessel was born in Minden, Westphalia, then capital of the Prussian administrative region Minden-Ravensberg, as second son of a civil servant into a large family. At the age of 14 he left the school, because he did not like the education in Latin language, and apprenticed in the import-export concern Kulenkamp at Bremen. The business&#x27;s reliance on cargo ships led him to turn his mathematical skills to problems in navigation. This in turn led to an interest in astronomy as a way of determining longitude.

Bessel came to the attention of Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers, a practising physician of Bremen and well-known astronomer, by producing a refinement on the orbital calculations for Halley&#x27;s Comet in 1804, using old observation data taken from Thomas Harriot and Nathaniel Torporley in 1607. Franz Xaver von Zach edited the results in his journal &quot;Monatliche Correspondenz&quot;.

Having finished his commercial education, Bessel left Kulenkamp in 1806 and became assistant at Johann Hieronymus Schröter&#x27;s private observatory in Lilienthal near Bremen as successor of Karl Ludwig Harding. There he worked on James Bradley&#x27;s stellar observation data to produce precise positions for some 3,222 stars.

Despite lacking any higher education, especially at university, Bessel was appointed director of the newly founded Königsberg Observatory by King Frederick William III of Prussia in January 1810, at the age of 25, and remained in that position until his death. Some elder professors of the Philosophical Faculty disputed Bessel&#x27;s right to teach mathematics without any academic degree. Therefore, he turned to his fellow Carl Friedrich Gauss, who provided the award of an honorary doctor degree from the University of Göttingen in March 1811. Both scientists were in correspondence from 1804 to 1843. In 1837 they got in quarrel about Gauss&#x27;s habit of very slow publication.

In 1842 Bessel took part in the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Manchester, accompanied by the geophysicist Georg Adolf Erman and the mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, where he gave a report on astronomical clocks.

Bessel married Johanna Hagen, the daughter of the chemist and pharmacist Karl Gottfried Hagen who was the uncle of the physician and biologist Hermann August Hagen and the hydraulic engineer Gotthilf Hagen, the latter also Bessel&#x27;s student and assistant from 1816 to 1818. The physicist Franz Ernst Neumann, Bessel&#x27;s close companion and colleague, was married to Johanna Hagen&#x27;s sister Florentine. Neumann introduced Bessel&#x27;s exacting methods of measurement and data reduction into his mathematico-physical seminar, which he co-directed with Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi at Königsberg. These exacting methods had a lasting impact upon the work of Neumann&#x27;s students and upon the Prussian conception of precision in measurement.

Bessel had two sons and three daughters. His elder son became an architect but died suddenly in 1840 aged 26; his younger son died shortly after birth. His eldest daughter, Marie, married the physicist Georg Adolf Erman, member of the scholar family Erman. One of their sons in turn was the renowned Egyptologist Adolf Erman. His third daughter Johanna married the politician Adolf Hermann Hagen; one of their sons was the physicist Ernst Bessel Hagen, and the mathematician Erich Bessel-Hagen was a grandson of them. Bessel was godfather of Adolf von Baeyer, son of his collaborator Johann Jacob Baeyer.

After several months of illness Bessel died in March 1846 at his observatory from retroperitoneal fibrosis.

== Work ==
While the observatory was still in construction Bessel elaborated the &quot;Fundamenta Astronomiae&quot; based on Bradley&#x27;s observations. As a preliminary result he produced tables of atmospheric refraction that won him the Lalande Prize from the French Academy of Sciences in 1811. The Königsberg Observatory began operation in 1813.

Starting in 1819, Bessel determined the position of over 50,000 stars with a meridian circle from Reichenbach, assisted by some of his qualified students. The most prominent of them was Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander, his successors were Otto August Rosenberger and August Ludwig Busch.

Bessel determined the first reliable value for the distance between a star and the solar system with a heliometer from Fraunhofer using the method of stellar parallax. In 1838 he published a parallax of 0.314 arcseconds for 61 Cygni, which indicated that the star is 10.3 ly away. Compared with the current measurement of 11.4 ly, Bessel&#x27;s figure had an error of 9.6%. Thanks to these results astronomers had not only enlarged the vision of the universe well beyond the cosmic magnitude, but after the discovery in 1728 by James Bradley of the aberration of light a second empirical evidence of the Earth&#x27;s relative movement was produced. A short time later Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve and Thomas Henderson reported the parallaxes of Vega and Alpha Centauri.

Precise measurements with a new meridian circle from Adolf Repsold allowed Bessel to notice deviations in the motions of Sirius and Procyon, which must be caused by the gravitational attraction of unseen companions.
His announcement of Sirius&#x27;s &quot;dark companion&quot; in 1844 was the first correct claim of a previously unobserved companion by positional measurement, and eventually led to the discovery of Sirius B by Alvan Graham Clark in 1862, the first discovery of a white dwarf. John Martin Schaeberle discovered Procyon B in 1896.

Bessel was the first scientist who realized the effect later called &quot;personal equation&quot;, that several simultaneously observing persons determine slightly different values, especially recording the transit time of stars.

In 1824, Bessel developed a new method for calculating the circumstances of eclipses using the so-called Besselian elements. His method simplified the calculation to such an extent, without sacrificing accuracy, that it is still in use today.

On Bessel&#x27;s proposal the Prussian Academy of Sciences started the edition of the &quot;Berliner Akademische Sternkarten&quot; (&quot;Berlin Academic Star Charts&quot;) in 1825 as an international project with Johann Franz Encke as executive editor. One unpublished new chart enabled Johann Gottfried Galle to find Neptune near the position calculated by Le Verrier in September 1846 at Berlin Observatory.

In the 18th century a series of cylinder functions were introduced to solve string vibration problems by Daniel Bernoulli, Leonhard Euler and others. These functions were used by Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Bessel to solve the Kepler&#x27;s equation. Bessel later systematically studied the mathematical properties of these functions, now known as Bessel functions. These functions are critical for the solution of certain differential equations, these functions are used throughout both classical and quantum physics. In his studies of this functions, Bessel published for the first time the Fourier series, before Joseph Fourier who had worked on it but his work was published decades later.

A correction term in the formula for the sample variance estimator is named in his honour. This is the use of the factor &quot;n&quot; − 1 in the denominator of the formula, rather than just &quot;n&quot;. This occurs when the &quot;sample mean&quot; rather than the &quot;population mean&quot; is used to centre the data and since the sample mean is a linear combination of the data the residual to the sample mean overcounts the number of degrees of freedom by the number of constraint equations — in this case one.
Like numerous astronomers of his time Bessel dealt on the field of geodesy, too,
first theoretically, when he published a method for solving the main geodetic problem.
In 1830 he got the royal order for the survey of East Prussia with the purpose to connect the yet existing Prussian and Russian triangulation networks. This work was carried out in cooperation with Johann Jacob Baeyer, then major of the Prussian army; the final report was published in 1838.
He also obtained an estimate of increased accuracy for the Earth&#x27;s ellipsoid, nowadays called the Bessel ellipsoid, based on several arc measurements.

* Member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1812
* Member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1816
* Foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1823
* Fellow of the Royal Society in 1825

Bessel was one of the first members of the Order Pour le Merite (Civil class) when it was established in 1842.

The first cosmic object named after Bessel is the largest crater in the Moon&#x27;s Mare Serenitatis. The main-belt asteroid 1552 Bessel was named at the centenary of the parallaxe determination in 1938.

Geographical commemorations are two fjords in Greenland, Bessel Fjord, NE Greenland and Bessel Fjord, NW Greenland.

&quot;Xyletinus besseli&quot; a fossil beetle from the Eocene belonging to the family Ptinidae, found in the Baltic amber in Sambia, was named in his honour.

BeSSel, the &quot;Bar and Spiral Structure Legacy Survey&quot;, is named after him.

<text>The Fermi paradox is the discrepancy between the lack of conclusive evidence of advanced extraterrestrial life and the apparently high likelihood of its existence. Those affirming the paradox generally conclude that if the conditions required for life to arise from non-living matter are as permissive as the available evidence on Earth indicates, then extraterrestrial life would be sufficiently common such that it would be implausible for it not to have been detected.

The quandary takes its name from the Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi: in the summer of 1950, Fermi was engaged in casual conversation about contemporary UFO reports and the possibility of faster-than-light travel with fellow physicists Edward Teller, Herbert York, and Emil Konopinski while the group was walking to lunch. The conversation moved on to other topics, until Fermi later blurted out during lunch, &quot;But where is everybody?&quot; (the exact quote is uncertain.)

There have been many attempts to resolve the Fermi paradox, such as suggesting that intelligent extraterrestrial beings are extremely rare, that the lifetime of such civilizations is short, or that they exist but (for various reasons) humans see no evidence.
==Chain of reasoning==
Some of the facts and hypotheses that together serve to highlight the apparent contradiction:
* There are billions of stars in the Milky Way similar to the Sun.
* With high probability, some of these stars have Earth-like planets in a circumstellar habitable zone. 
* Many of these stars, and hence their planets, are much older than the Sun. If Earth-like planets are typical, some may have developed intelligent life long ago.
* Some of these civilizations may have developed interstellar travel, a step that humans are investigating.
* Even at the slow pace of envisioned interstellar travel, the Milky Way galaxy could be completely traversed in a few million years.
* Since many of the Sun-like stars are billions of years older than the Sun, the Earth should have already been visited by extraterrestrial civilizations, or at least their probes.
* However, there is no convincing evidence that this has happened.

==History==
Fermi was not the first to ask the question. An earlier implicit mention was by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in an unpublished manuscript from 1933. He noted &quot;people deny the presence of intelligent beings on the planets of the universe&quot; because &quot;(i) if such beings exist they would have visited Earth, and (ii) if such civilizations existed then they would have given us some sign of their existence&quot;. This was not a paradox for others, who took this to imply the absence of extraterrestrial life. But it was one for him, since he believed in extraterrestrial life and the possibility of space travel. Therefore, he proposed what is now known as the zoo hypothesis and speculated that mankind is not yet ready for higher beings to contact us. In turn, Tsiolkovsky himself was not the first to discover the paradox, as shown by his reference to other people&#x27;s reasons for not accepting the premise that extraterrestrial civilizations exist.

In 1975, Michael H. Hart published a detailed examination of the paradox, one of the first to do so. He argued that if intelligent extraterrestrials exist, and are capable of space travel, then the galaxy could have been colonized in a time much less than that of the age of the Earth. However, there is no observable evidence they have been here, which Hart called &quot;Fact A&quot;.

Other names closely related to Fermi&#x27;s question (&quot;Where are they?&quot;) include the Great Silence, and (Latin for &quot;silence of the universe&quot;), though these only refer to one portion of the Fermi paradox, that humans see no evidence of other civilizations.

=== Original conversations ===

In the summer of 1950 at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, Enrico Fermi and co-workers Emil Konopinski, Edward Teller, and Herbert York had one or several lunchtime conversations. In one, Fermi suddenly blurted out, &quot;Where is everybody?&quot; (Teller&#x27;s letter), or &quot;Don&#x27;t you ever wonder where everybody is?&quot; (York&#x27;s letter), or &quot;But where is everybody?&quot; (Konopinski&#x27;s letter). Teller wrote, &quot;The result of his question was general laughter because of the strange fact that, in spite of Fermi&#x27;s question coming out of the blue, everybody around the table seemed to understand at once that he was talking about extraterrestrial life.&quot;

In 1984, York wrote that Fermi &quot;followed up with a series of calculations on the probability of earthlike planets, the probability of life given an earth, the probability of humans given life, the likely rise and duration of high technology, and so on. He concluded on the basis of such calculations that we ought to have been visited long ago and many times over.&quot; Teller remembers that not much came of this conversation &quot;except perhaps a statement that the distances to the next location of living beings may be very great and that, indeed, as far as our galaxy is concerned, we are living somewhere in the sticks, far removed from the metropolitan area of the galactic center.&quot;

Fermi died of cancer in 1954. However, in letters to the three surviving men decades later in 1984, Dr. Eric Jones of Los Alamos was able to partially put the original conversation back together. He informed each of the men that he wished to include a reasonably accurate version or composite in the written proceedings he was putting together for a previously held conference entitled &quot;Interstellar Migration and the Human Experience&quot;. Jones first sent a letter to Edward Teller which included a secondhand account from Hans Mark. Teller responded, and then Jones sent Teller&#x27;s letter to Herbert York. York responded, and finally, Jones sent both Teller&#x27;s and York&#x27;s letters to Emil Konopinski who also responded. Furthermore, Konopinski was able to later identify a cartoon which Jones found as the one involved in the conversation and thereby help to settle the time period as being the summer of 1950.

== Basis ==
The Fermi paradox is a conflict between the argument that scale and probability seem to favor intelligent life being common in the universe, and the total lack of evidence of intelligent life having ever arisen anywhere other than on Earth.

The first aspect of the Fermi paradox is a function of the scale or the large numbers involved: there are an estimated 200–400 billion stars in the Milky Way (2–4 × 1011) and 70 sextillion (7×1022) in the observable universe. Even if intelligent life occurs on only a minuscule percentage of planets around these stars, there might still be a great number of civilizations, and if the percentage were high enough it would produce a significant number of extant civilizations in the Milky Way. This assumes the mediocrity principle, by which Earth is a typical planet.

The second aspect of the Fermi paradox is the argument of probability: given intelligent life&#x27;s ability to overcome scarcity, and its tendency to colonize new habitats, it seems possible that at least some civilizations would be technologically advanced, seek out new resources in space, and colonize their star system and, subsequently, surrounding star systems. Since there is no significant evidence on Earth, or elsewhere in the known universe, of other intelligent life after 13.8 billion years of the universe&#x27;s history, there is a conflict requiring a resolution. Some examples of possible resolutions are that intelligent life is rarer than is thought, that assumptions about the general development or behavior of intelligent species are flawed, or, more radically, that the scientific understanding of the nature of the universe is quite incomplete.

The Fermi paradox can be asked in two ways. The first is, &quot;Why are no aliens or their artifacts found on Earth, or in the Solar System?&quot;. If interstellar travel is possible, even the &quot;slow&quot; kind nearly within the reach of Earth technology, then it would only take from 5 million to 50 million years to colonize the galaxy. This is relatively brief on a geological scale, let alone a cosmological one. Since there are many stars older than the Sun, and since intelligent life might have evolved earlier elsewhere, the question then becomes why the galaxy has not been colonized already. Even if colonization is impractical or undesirable to all alien civilizations, large-scale exploration of the galaxy could be possible by probes. These might leave detectable artifacts in the Solar System, such as old probes or evidence of mining activity, but none of these have been observed.

The second form of the question is &quot;Why are there no signs of intelligence elsewhere in the universe?&quot;. This version does not assume interstellar travel, but includes other galaxies as well. For distant galaxies, travel times may well explain the lack of alien visits to Earth, but a sufficiently advanced civilization could potentially be observable over a significant fraction of the size of the observable universe. Even if such civilizations are rare, the scale argument indicates they should exist somewhere at some point during the history of the universe, and since they could be detected from far away over a considerable period of time, many more potential sites for their origin are within range of human observation. It is unknown whether the paradox is stronger for the Milky Way galaxy or for the universe as a whole.

=== Drake equation ===
The theories and principles in the Drake equation are closely related to the Fermi paradox. The equation was formulated by Frank Drake in 1961 in an attempt to find a systematic means to evaluate the numerous probabilities involved in the existence of alien life. The equation is:

:formula_1

Where formula_2 is the number of technologically advanced civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy, and formula_2 is asserted to be the product of 
* formula_4, the rate of formation of stars in the galaxy;
* formula_5, the fraction of those stars with planetary systems;
* formula_6, the number of planets, per solar system, with an environment suitable for organic life;
* formula_7, the fraction of those suitable planets whereon organic life appears;
* formula_8, the fraction of life-bearing planets whereon &quot;intelligent&quot; life appears;
* formula_9, the fraction of civilizations that reach the technological level whereby detectable signals may be dispatched; and
* formula_10, the length of time that those civilizations dispatch their signals.

The fundamental problem is that the last four terms (formula_7, formula_8, formula_9, and formula_10) are entirely unknown, rendering statistical estimates impossible.

The Drake equation has been used by both optimists and pessimists, with wildly differing results. The first scientific meeting on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), which had 10 attendees including Frank Drake and Carl Sagan, speculated that the number of civilizations was roughly between 1,000 and 100,000,000 civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. Conversely, Frank Tipler and John D. Barrow used pessimistic numbers and speculated that the average number of civilizations in a galaxy is much less than one. Almost all arguments involving the Drake equation suffer from the overconfidence effect, a common error of probabilistic reasoning about low-probability events, by guessing specific numbers for likelihoods of events whose mechanism is not understood, such as the likelihood of abiogenesis on an Earth-like planet, with estimates varying over many hundreds of orders of magnitude. An analysis that takes into account some of the uncertainty associated with this lack of understanding has been carried out by Anders Sandberg, Eric Drexler and Toby Ord, and suggests &quot;a substantial &quot;ex ante&quot; probability of there being no other intelligent life in our observable universe&quot;.

=== Great Filter ===

The Great Filter, a concept introduced by Robin Hanson in 1996, represents whatever natural phenomena that would make it unlikely for life to evolve from inanimate matter to an advanced civilization. The most commonly agreed-upon low probability event is abiogenesis: a gradual process of increasing complexity of the first self-replicating molecules by a randomly occurring chemical process. Other proposed great filters are the emergence of eukaryotic cells or of meiosis or some of the steps involved in the evolution of a brain capable of complex logical deductions.

Astrobiologists Dirk Schulze-Makuch and William Bains, reviewing the history of life on Earth, including convergent evolution, concluded that transitions such as oxygenic photosynthesis, the eukaryotic cell, multicellularity, and tool-using intelligence are likely to occur on any Earth-like planet given enough time. They argue that the Great Filter may be abiogenesis, the rise of technological human-level intelligence, or an inability to settle other worlds because of self-destruction or a lack of resources. Paleobiologist Olev Vinn has suggested that the great filter may have universal biological roots related to evolutionary animal behavior.

=== Grabby Aliens ===

In 2021, the concepts of quiet, loud, and grabby aliens were introduced by Hanson &quot;et al.&quot; The possible &quot;loud&quot; aliens expand rapidly in a highly detectable way throughout the universe and endure, while &quot;quiet&quot; aliens are hard or impossible to detect and eventually disappear. &quot;Grabby&quot; aliens prevent the emergence of other civilizations in their sphere of influence, which expands at a rate near the speed of light. The authors argue that if loud civilizations are rare, as they appear to be, then quiet civilizations are also rare. The paper suggests that humanity&#x27;s existing stage of technological development is relatively early in the potential timeline of intelligent life in the universe, as loud aliens would otherwise be observable by astronomers.

Earlier in 2013, Anders Sandberg and Stuart Armstrong examined the potential for intelligent life to spread intergalactically throughout the universe and the implications for the Fermi Paradox. Their study suggests that with sufficient energy, intelligent civilizations could potentially colonize the entire Milky Way galaxy within a few million years, and spread to nearby galaxies in a timespan that is cosmologically brief. They conclude that intergalactic colonization appears possible with the resources of a single solar system and that intergalactic colonization is of comparable difficulty to interstellar colonization, and therefore the Fermi paradox is much sharper than commonly thought.

== Empirical evidence ==
There are two parts of the Fermi paradox that rely on empirical evidence—that there are many potentially habitable planets, and that humans see no evidence of life. The first point, that many suitable planets exist, was an assumption in Fermi&#x27;s time, but is since supported by the discovery that exoplanets are common. Existing models predict billions of habitable worlds in the Milky Way.

The second part of the paradox, that humans see no evidence of extraterrestrial life, is also an active field of scientific research. This includes both efforts to find any indication of life, and efforts specifically directed to finding intelligent life. These searches have been made since 1960, and several are ongoing.

Although astronomers do not usually search for extraterrestrials, they have observed phenomena that they could not immediately explain without positing an intelligent civilization as the source. For example, pulsars, when first discovered in 1967, were called little green men (LGM) because of the precise repetition of their pulses. In all cases, explanations with no need for intelligent life have been found for such observations, but the possibility of discovery remains. Proposed examples include asteroid mining that would change the appearance of debris disks around stars, or spectral lines from nuclear waste disposal in stars.

Explanations based on technosignatures, such as radio communications, have been presented.

=== Electromagnetic emissions ===
Radio technology and the ability to construct a radio telescope are presumed to be a natural advance for technological species, theoretically creating effects that might be detected over interstellar distances. The careful searching for non-natural radio emissions from space may lead to the detection of alien civilizations. Sensitive alien observers of the Solar System, for example, would note unusually intense radio waves for a G2 star due to Earth&#x27;s television and telecommunication broadcasts. In the absence of an apparent natural cause, alien observers might infer the existence of a terrestrial civilization. Such signals could be either &quot;accidental&quot; by-products of a civilization, or deliberate attempts to communicate, such as the Arecibo message. It is unclear whether &quot;leakage&quot;, as opposed to a deliberate beacon, could be detected by an extraterrestrial civilization. The most sensitive radio telescopes on Earth, , would not be able to detect non-directional radio signals (such as broadband) even at a fraction of a light-year away, but other civilizations could hypothetically have much better equipment.

A number of astronomers and observatories have attempted and are attempting to detect such evidence, mostly through SETI organizations such as the SETI Institute and Breakthrough Listen. Several decades of SETI analysis have not revealed any unusually bright or meaningfully repetitive radio emissions.

=== Direct planetary observation ===

Exoplanet detection and classification is a very active sub-discipline in astronomy; the first candidate terrestrial planet discovered within a star&#x27;s habitable zone was found in 2007. New refinements in exoplanet detection methods, and use of existing methods from space (such as the Kepler and TESS missions) are starting to detect and characterize Earth-size planets, to determine whether they are within the habitable zones of their stars. Such observational refinements may allow for a better estimation of how common these potentially habitable worlds are.

=== Conjectures about interstellar probes ===

The Hart–Tipler conjecture is a form of contraposition which states that because no interstellar probes have been detected, there likely is no other intelligent life in the universe, as such life should be expected to eventually create and launch such probes. Self-replicating probes could exhaustively explore a galaxy the size of the Milky Way in as little as a million years. If even a single civilization in the Milky Way attempted this, such probes could spread throughout the entire galaxy. Another speculation for contact with an alien probe—one that would be trying to find human beings—is an alien Bracewell probe. Such a hypothetical device would be an autonomous space probe whose purpose is to seek out and communicate with alien civilizations (as opposed to von Neumann probes, which are usually described as purely exploratory). These were proposed as an alternative to carrying a slow speed-of-light dialogue between vastly distant neighbors. Rather than contending with the long delays a radio dialogue would suffer, a probe housing an artificial intelligence would seek out an alien civilization to carry on a close-range communication with the discovered civilization. The findings of such a probe would still have to be transmitted to the home civilization at light speed, but an information-gathering dialogue could be conducted in real time.

Direct exploration of the Solar System has yielded no evidence indicating a visit by aliens or their probes. Detailed exploration of areas of the Solar System where resources would be plentiful may yet produce evidence of alien exploration, though the entirety of the Solar System is relatively vast and difficult to investigate. Attempts to signal, attract, or activate hypothetical Bracewell probes in Earth&#x27;s vicinity have not succeeded.

=== Searches for stellar-scale artifacts ===
In 1959, Freeman Dyson observed that every developing human civilization constantly increases its energy consumption, and he conjectured that a civilization might try to harness a large part of the energy produced by a star. He proposed a hypothetical &quot;Dyson sphere&quot; as a means: a shell or cloud of objects enclosing a star to absorb and utilize as much radiant energy as possible. Such a feat of astroengineering would drastically alter the observed spectrum of the star involved, changing it at least partly from the normal emission lines of a natural stellar atmosphere to those of black-body radiation, probably with a peak in the infrared. Dyson speculated that advanced alien civilizations might be detected by examining the spectra of stars and searching for such an altered spectrum.

There have been attempts to find evidence of Dyson spheres that would alter the spectra of their core stars. Direct observation of thousands of galaxies has shown no explicit evidence of artificial construction or modifications. In October 2015, there was speculation that a dimming of light from star KIC 8462852, observed by the Kepler space telescope, could have been a result of Dyson sphere construction. However, in 2018, further observations determined that the amount of dimming varied by the frequency of the light, pointing to dust, rather than an opaque object such as a Dyson sphere, as the cause of the dimming.

== Hypothetical explanations for the paradox ==
=== Rarity of intelligent life===
==== Extraterrestrial life is rare or non-existent ====

Those who think that intelligent extraterrestrial life is (nearly) impossible argue that the conditions needed for the evolution of life—or at least the evolution of biological complexity—are rare or even unique to Earth. Under this assumption, called the rare Earth hypothesis, a rejection of the mediocrity principle, complex multicellular life is regarded as exceedingly unusual.

The rare Earth hypothesis argues that the evolution of biological complexity requires a host of fortuitous circumstances, such as a galactic habitable zone, a star and planet(s) having the requisite conditions, such as enough of a continuous habitable zone, the advantage of a giant guardian like Jupiter and a large moon, conditions needed to ensure the planet has a magnetosphere and plate tectonics, the chemistry of the lithosphere, atmosphere, and oceans, the role of &quot;evolutionary pumps&quot; such as massive glaciation and rare bolide impacts. Perhaps most importantly, advanced life needs whatever it was that led to the transition of (some) prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, sexual reproduction and the Cambrian explosion.

In his book &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; (1989), Stephen Jay Gould suggested that if the &quot;tape of life&quot; were rewound to the time of the Cambrian explosion, and one or two tweaks made, human beings probably never would have evolved. Other thinkers such as Fontana, Buss, and Kauffman have written about the self-organizing properties of life.

==== Extraterrestrial intelligence is rare or non-existent ====
It is possible that even if complex life is common, intelligence (and consequently civilizations) is not. While there are remote sensing techniques that could perhaps detect life-bearing planets without relying on the signs of technology, none of them have the ability to determine if any detected life is intelligent. This is sometimes referred to as the &quot;algae vs. alumnae&quot; problem.

Charles Lineweaver states that when considering any extreme trait in an animal, intermediate stages do not necessarily produce &quot;inevitable&quot; outcomes. For example, large brains are no more &quot;inevitable&quot;, or convergent, than are the long noses of animals such as aardvarks and elephants. As he points out, &quot;dolphins have had ~20million years to build a radio telescope and have not done so&quot;. In addition, Rebecca Boyle points out that of all the species that have evolved in the history of life on the planet Earth, only one—human beings and only in the beginning stages—has ever become space-faring.

==== Periodic extinction by natural events ====
New life might commonly die out due to runaway heating or cooling on their fledgling planets. On Earth, there have been numerous major extinction events that destroyed the majority of complex species alive at the time; the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs is the best known example. These are thought to have been caused by events such as impact from a large meteorite, massive volcanic eruptions, or astronomical events such as gamma-ray bursts. It may be the case that such extinction events are common throughout the universe and periodically destroy intelligent life, or at least its civilizations, before the species is able to develop the technology to communicate with other intelligent species.

However, the chances of extinction by natural events may be very low on the scale of a civilization&#x27;s lifetime. Based on an analysis of impact craters on Earth and the Moon, the average interval between impacts large enough to cause global consequences (like the Chicxulub impact) is estimated to be around 100 million years.

=== Evolutionary explanations ===
==== Intelligent alien species have not developed advanced technologies ====

It may be that while alien species with intelligence exist, they are primitive or have not reached the level of technological advancement necessary to communicate. Along with non-intelligent life, such civilizations would also be very difficult to detect. A trip using conventional rockets would take hundreds of thousands of years to reach the nearest stars.

To skeptics, the fact that over the history of life on the Earth, only one species has developed a civilization to the point of being capable of spaceflight and radio technology, lends credence to the idea that technologically advanced civilizations are rare in the universe.

Amedeo Balbi and Adam Frank propose the concept of an &quot;oxygen bottleneck&quot; for the emergence of technospheres. The &quot;oxygen bottleneck&quot; refers to the critical level of atmospheric oxygen necessary for fire and combustion. Earth&#x27;s atmospheric oxygen concentration is about 21%, but has been much lower in the past and may also be on many exoplanets. The authors argue that while the threshold of oxygen required for the existence of complex life and ecosystems is much lower, technological advancement, particularly that reliant on combustion, such as metal smelting and energy production, requires higher oxygen concentrations of around 18% or more. Thus, the presence of high levels of oxygen in a planet&#x27;s atmosphere is not only a potential biosignature but also a critical factor in the emergence of detectable technological civilizations.

Another hypothesis in this category is the &quot;Water World hypothesis&quot;. According to author and scientist David Brin: &quot;it turns out that our Earth skates the very inner edge of our sun&#x27;s continuously habitable—or &#x27;Goldilocks&#x27;—zone. And Earth may be anomalous. It may be that because we are so close to our sun, we have an anomalously oxygen-rich atmosphere, and we have anomalously little ocean for a water world. In other words, 32 percent continental mass may be high among water worlds...&quot; Brin continues, &quot;In which case, the evolution of creatures like us, with hands and fire and all that sort of thing, may be rare in the galaxy. In which case, when we do build starships and head out there, perhaps we&#x27;ll find lots and lots of life worlds, but they&#x27;re all like Polynesia. We&#x27;ll find lots and lots of intelligent lifeforms out there, but they&#x27;re all dolphins, whales, squids, who could never build their own starships. What a perfect universe for us to be in, because nobody would be able to boss us around, and we&#x27;d get to be the voyagers, the &quot;Star Trek&quot; people, the starship builders, the policemen, and so on.&quot;

The rapid increase of scientific and technological progress seen in the 19th and 20th centuries, compared to earlier eras, led to the common assumption that such progresses will keep growing at exponential rates as time goes by, eventually leading to the progress level required for space exploration. The &quot;universal limit to technological development&quot; (ULTD) hypothesis proposes that there is a limit to the potential growth of a civilization, and that this limit may be placed well below the point required for space exploration. Such limits may be based on economic reasons, natural reasons (such as faster-than-light travel being impossible), and even limitations based on the species&#x27; own biology.

==== It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself ====

This is the argument that technological civilizations may usually or invariably destroy themselves before or shortly after developing radio or spaceflight technology. The astrophysicist Sebastian von Hoerner stated that the progress of science and technology on Earth was driven by two factors—the struggle for domination and the desire for an easy life. The former potentially leads to complete destruction, while the latter may lead to biological or mental degeneration. Possible means of annihilation via major global issues, where global interconnectedness actually makes humanity more vulnerable than resilient, are many, including war, accidental environmental contamination or damage, the development of biotechnology, synthetic life like mirror life, resource depletion, climate change, or poorly-designed artificial intelligence. This general theme is explored both in fiction and in scientific hypotheses.

In 1966, Sagan and Shklovskii speculated that technological civilizations will either tend to destroy themselves within a century of developing interstellar communicative capability or master their self-destructive tendencies and survive for billion-year timescales. Self-annihilation may also be viewed in terms of thermodynamics: insofar as life is an ordered system that can sustain itself against the tendency to disorder, Stephen Hawking&#x27;s &quot;external transmission&quot; or interstellar communicative phase, where knowledge production and knowledge management is more important than transmission of information via evolution, may be the point at which the system becomes unstable and self-destructs. Here, Hawking emphasizes self-design of the human genome (transhumanism) or enhancement via machines (e.g., brain–computer interface) to enhance human intelligence and reduce aggression, without which he implies human civilization may be too stupid collectively to survive an increasingly unstable system. For instance, the development of technologies during the &quot;external transmission&quot; phase, such as weaponization of artificial general intelligence or antimatter, may not be met by concomitant increases in human ability to manage its own inventions. Consequently, disorder increases in the system: global governance may become increasingly destabilized, worsening humanity&#x27;s ability to manage the possible means of annihilation listed above, resulting in global societal collapse.

A less theoretical example might be the resource-depletion issue on Polynesian islands, of which Easter Island is only the best known. David Brin points out that during the expansion phase from 1500 BC to 800 AD there were cycles of overpopulation followed by what might be called periodic cullings of adult males through war or ritual. He writes, &quot;There are many stories of islands whose men were almost wiped out—sometimes by internal strife, and sometimes by invading males from other islands.&quot;

Using extinct civilizations such as Easter Island (Rapa Nui) as models, a study conducted in 2018 by Adam Frank &quot;et al.&quot; posited that climate change induced by &quot;energy intensive&quot; civilizations may prevent sustainability within such civilizations, thus explaining the paradoxical lack of evidence for intelligent extraterrestrial life. Based on dynamical systems theory, the study examined how technological civilizations (exo-civilizations) consume resources and the feedback effects this consumption has on their planets and its carrying capacity. According to Adam Frank &quot;[t]he point is to recognize that driving climate change may be something generic. The laws of physics demand that any young population, building an energy-intensive civilization like ours, is going to have feedback on its planet. Seeing climate change in this cosmic context may give us better insight into what’s happening to us now and how to deal with it.&quot; Generalizing the Anthropocene, their model produces four different outcomes:
* Die-off: A scenario where the population grows quickly, surpassing the planet&#x27;s carrying capacity, which leads to a peak followed by a rapid decline. The population eventually stabilizes at a much lower equilibrium level, allowing the planet to partially recover.
* Sustainability: A scenario where civilizations successfully transition from high-impact resources (like fossil fuels) to sustainable ones (like solar energy) before significant environmental degradation occurs. This allows the civilization and planet to reach a stable equilibrium, avoiding catastrophic effects.
* Collapse Without Resource Change: In this trajectory, the population and environmental degradation increase rapidly. The civilization does not switch to sustainable resources in time, leading to a total collapse where a tipping point is crossed and the population drops.
* Collapse With Resource Change: Similar to the previous scenario, but in this case, the civilization attempts to transition to sustainable resources. However, the change comes too late, and the environmental damage is irreversible, still leading to the civilization&#x27;s collapse.

==== It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others ====

Another hypothesis is that an intelligent species beyond a certain point of technological capability will destroy other intelligent species as they appear, perhaps by using self-replicating probes. Science fiction writer Fred Saberhagen has explored this idea in his &quot;Berserker&quot; series, as has physicist Gregory Benford and also, science fiction writer Greg Bear in his &quot;The Forge of God&quot; novel, and later Liu Cixin in his &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; series.

A species might undertake such extermination out of expansionist motives, greed, paranoia, or aggression. In 1981, cosmologist Edward Harrison argued that such behavior would be an act of prudence: an intelligent species that has overcome its own self-destructive tendencies might view any other species bent on galactic expansion as a threat. It has also been suggested that a successful alien species would be a superpredator, as are humans. Another possibility invokes the &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; and the anthropic principle: the first lifeform to achieve interstellar travel will necessarily (even if unintentionally) prevent competitors from arising, and humans simply happen to be first.

==== Civilizations only broadcast detectable signals for a brief period of time ====
It may be that alien civilizations are detectable through their radio emissions for only a short time, reducing the likelihood of spotting them. The usual assumption is that civilizations outgrow radio through technological advancement. However, there could be other leakage such as that from microwaves used to transmit power from solar satellites to ground receivers. Regarding the first point, in a 2006 &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; article, Seth Shostak wrote, &quot;Moreover, radio leakage from a planet is only likely to get weaker as a civilization advances and its communications technology gets better. Earth itself is increasingly switching from broadcasts to leakage-free cables and fiber optics, and from primitive but obvious carrier-wave broadcasts to subtler, hard-to-recognize spread-spectrum transmissions.&quot;

More hypothetically, advanced alien civilizations may evolve beyond broadcasting at all in the electromagnetic spectrum and communicate by technologies not developed or used by mankind. Some scientists have hypothesized that advanced civilizations may send neutrino signals. If such signals exist, they could be detectable by neutrino detectors that are under construction for other goals.

==== Alien life may be too incomprehensible ====
Another possibility is that human theoreticians have underestimated how much alien life might differ from that on Earth. Aliens may be psychologically unwilling to attempt to communicate with human beings. Perhaps human mathematics is parochial to Earth and not shared by other life, though others argue this can only apply to abstract math since the math associated with physics must be similar (in results, if not in methods).

In his 2009 book, SETI scientist Seth Shostak wrote, &quot;Our experiments [such as plans to use drilling rigs on Mars] are still looking for the type of extraterrestrial that would have appealed to Percival Lowell [astronomer who believed he had observed canals on Mars].&quot;

Physiology might also be a communication barrier. Carl Sagan speculated that an alien species might have a thought process orders of magnitude slower (or faster) than that of humans. A message broadcast by that species might seem like random background noise to humans, and therefore go undetected.

Paul Davies stated that 500 years ago the very idea of a computer doing work merely by manipulating internal data may not have been viewed as a technology at all. He writes, &quot;Might there be a still level[...] If so, this &#x27;third level&#x27; would never be manifest through observations made at the informational level, still less the matter level. There is no vocabulary to describe the third level, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it is non-existent, and we need to be open to the possibility that alien technology may operate at the third level, or maybe the fourth, fifth[...] levels.&quot;

Arthur C. Clarke hypothesized that &quot;our technology must still be laughably primitive; we may well be like jungle savages listening for the throbbing of tom-toms, while the ether around them carries more words per second than they could utter in a lifetime&quot;. Another thought is that technological civilizations invariably experience a technological singularity and attain a post-biological character.

=== Sociological explanations ===
==== Colonization is not the cosmic norm ====
In response to Tipler&#x27;s idea of self-replicating probes, Stephen Jay Gould wrote, &quot;I must confess that I simply don&#x27;t know how to react to such arguments. I have enough trouble predicting the plans and reactions of the people closest to me. I am usually baffled by the thoughts and accomplishments of humans in different cultures. I&#x27;ll be damned if I can state with certainty what some extraterrestrial source of intelligence might do.&quot;

==== Alien species may have only settled part of the galaxy ====
According to a study by Frank &quot;et al.&quot;, advanced civilizations may not colonize everything in the galaxy due to their potential adoption of steady states of expansion. This hypothesis suggests that civilizations might reach a stable pattern of expansion where they neither collapse nor aggressively spread throughout the galaxy. A February 2019 article in &quot;Popular Science&quot; states, &quot;Sweeping across the Milky Way and establishing a unified galactic empire might be inevitable for a monolithic super-civilization, but most cultures are neither monolithic nor super—at least if our experience is any guide.&quot; Astrophysicist Adam Frank, along with co-authors such as astronomer Jason Wright, ran a variety of simulations in which they varied such factors as settlement lifespans, fractions of suitable planets, and recharge times between launches. They found many of their simulations seemingly resulted in a &quot;third category&quot; in which the Milky Way remains partially settled indefinitely. The abstract to their 2019 paper states, &quot;These results break the link between Hart&#x27;s famous &#x27;Fact A&#x27; (no interstellar visitors on Earth now) and the conclusion that humans must, therefore, be the only technological civilization in the galaxy. Explicitly, our solutions admit situations where our current circumstances are consistent with an otherwise settled, steady-state galaxy.&quot;

An alternative scenario is that long-lived civilizations may only choose to colonize stars during closest approach. As low mass K- and M-type dwarfs are by far the most common types of main sequence stars in the Milky Way, they are more likely to pass close to existing civilizations. These stars have longer life spans, which may be preferred by such a civilization. Interstellar travel capability of 0.3 light years is theoretically sufficient to colonize all M-dwarfs in the galaxy within 2 billion years. If the travel capability is increased to 2 light years, then all K-dwarfs can be colonized in the same time frame.

==== Alien species may isolate themselves in virtual worlds ====
Avi Loeb suggests that one possible explanation for the Fermi paradox is virtual reality technology. Individuals of extraterrestrial civilizations may prefer to spend time in virtual worlds or metaverses that have different physical law constraints as opposed to focusing on colonizing planets. Nick Bostrom suggests that some advanced beings may divest themselves entirely of physical form, create massive artificial virtual environments, transfer themselves into these environments through mind uploading, and exist totally within virtual worlds, ignoring the external physical universe.

It may be that intelligent alien life develops an &quot;increasing disinterest&quot; in their outside world. Possibly any sufficiently advanced society will develop highly engaging media and entertainment well before the capacity for advanced space travel, with the rate of appeal of these social contrivances being destined, because of their inherent reduced complexity, to overtake any desire for complex, expensive endeavors such as space exploration and communication. Once any sufficiently advanced civilization becomes able to master its environment, and most of its physical needs are met through technology, various &quot;social and entertainment technologies&quot;, including virtual reality, are postulated to become the primary drivers and motivations of that civilization.

==== Artificial intelligence may not expand ====

While artificial intelligence supplanting its creators could only deepen the Fermi paradox, such as through enabling the colonizing of the galaxy through self-replicating probes, it is also possible that after replacing its creators, artificial intelligence either doesn&#x27;t expand or endure for a variety of reasons. Michael A. Garrett has suggested that biological civilizations may universally underestimate the speed that AI systems progress, and not react to it in time, thus making it a possible great filter. He also argues that this could make the longevity of advanced technological civilizations less than 200 years, thus explaining the great silence observed by SETI.

=== Economic explanations ===
==== Lack of resources needed to physically spread throughout the galaxy ====

The ability of an alien culture to colonize other star systems is based on the idea that interstellar travel is technologically feasible. While the existing understanding of physics rules out the possibility of faster-than-light travel, it appears that there are no major theoretical barriers to the construction of &quot;slow&quot; interstellar ships, even though the engineering required is considerably beyond existing human capabilities. This idea underlies the concept of the Von Neumann probe and the Bracewell probe as a potential evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence.

It is possible, however, that scientific knowledge cannot properly gauge the feasibility and costs of such interstellar colonization. Theoretical barriers may not yet be understood, and the resources needed may be so great as to make it unlikely that any civilization could afford to attempt it. Even if interstellar travel and colonization are possible, they may be difficult, leading to a colonization model based on percolation theory.

Colonization efforts may not occur as an unstoppable rush, but rather as an uneven tendency to &quot;percolate&quot; outwards, within an eventual slowing and termination of the effort given the enormous costs involved and the expectation that colonies will inevitably develop a culture and civilization of their own. Colonization may thus occur in &quot;clusters&quot;, with large areas remaining uncolonized at any one time.

==== Information is cheaper to transmit than matter is to transfer ====
If a human-capability machine intelligence is possible, and if it is possible to transfer such constructs over vast distances and rebuild them on a remote machine, then it might not make strong economic sense to travel the galaxy by spaceflight. Louis K. Scheffer calculates the cost of radio transmission of information across space to be cheaper than spaceflight by a factor of 108–1017. For a machine civilization, the costs of interstellar travel are therefore enormous compared to the more efficient option of sending computational signals across space to already established sites. After the first civilization has physically explored or colonized the galaxy, as well as sent such machines for easy exploration, then any subsequent civilizations, after having contacted the first, may find it cheaper, faster, and easier to explore the galaxy through intelligent mind transfers to the machines built by the first civilization. However, since a star system needs only one such remote machine, and the communication is most likely highly directed, transmitted at high-frequencies, and at a minimal power to be economical, such signals would be hard to detect from Earth.

By contrast, in economics the counter-intuitive Jevons paradox implies that higher productivity results in higher demand. In other words, increased economic efficiency results in increased economic growth. For example, increased renewable energy has the risk of not directly resulting in declining fossil fuel use, but rather additional economic growth as fossil fuels instead are directed to alternative uses. Thus, technological innovation makes human civilization more capable of higher levels of consumption, as opposed to its existing consumption being achieved more efficiently at a stable level.

=== Discovery of extraterrestrial life is too difficult ===
==== Humans have not listened properly ====
There are some assumptions that underlie the SETI programs that may cause searchers to miss signals that exist. Extraterrestrials might, for example, transmit signals that have a very high or low data rate, or employ unconventional (in human terms) frequencies, which would make them hard to distinguish from background noise. Signals might be sent from non-main sequence star systems that humans search with lower priority; our programs assume that most alien life will be orbiting Sun-like stars.

The greatest challenge is the sheer size of the radio search needed to look for signals (effectively spanning the entire observable universe), the limited amount of resources committed to SETI, and the sensitivity of modern instruments. SETI estimates, for instance, that with a radio telescope as sensitive as the Arecibo Observatory, Earth&#x27;s television and radio broadcasts would only be detectable at distances up to 0.3 light-years, less than 1/10 the distance to the nearest star. A signal is much easier to detect if it consists of a deliberate, powerful transmission directed at Earth. Such signals could be detected at ranges of hundreds to tens of thousands of light-years distance. However, this means that detectors must be listening to an appropriate range of frequencies, and be in that region of space to which the beam is being sent. Many SETI searches assume that extraterrestrial civilizations will be broadcasting a deliberate signal, like the Arecibo message, in order to be found.

Thus, to detect alien civilizations through their radio emissions, Earth observers either need more sensitive instruments or must hope for fortunate circumstances: that the broadband radio emissions of alien radio technology are much stronger than humanity&#x27;s own; that one of SETI&#x27;s programs is listening to the correct frequencies from the right regions of space; or that aliens are deliberately sending focused transmissions in Earth&#x27;s general direction.

==== Humans have not listened for long enough ====
Humanity&#x27;s ability to detect intelligent extraterrestrial life has existed for only a very brief period—from 1937 onwards, if the invention of the radio telescope is taken as the dividing line—and &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; is a geologically recent species. The whole period of modern human existence to date is a very brief period on a cosmological scale, and radio transmissions have only been propagated since 1895. Thus, it remains possible that human beings have neither existed long enough nor made themselves sufficiently detectable to be found by extraterrestrial intelligence.

==== Intelligent life may be too far away ====

It may be that non-colonizing technologically capable alien civilizations exist, but that they are simply too far apart for meaningful two-way communication. Sebastian von Hoerner estimated the average duration of civilization at 6,500 years and the average distance between civilizations in the Milky Way at 1,000 light years. If two civilizations are separated by several thousand light-years, it is possible that one or both cultures may become extinct before meaningful dialogue can be established. Human searches may be able to detect their existence, but communication will remain impossible because of distance. It has been suggested that this problem might be ameliorated somewhat if contact and communication is made through a Bracewell probe. In this case at least one partner in the exchange may obtain meaningful information. Alternatively, a civilization may simply broadcast its knowledge, and leave it to the receiver to make what they may of it. This is similar to the transmission of information from ancient civilizations to the present, and humanity has undertaken similar activities like the Arecibo message, which could transfer information about Earth&#x27;s intelligent species, even if it never yields a response or does not yield a response in time for humanity to receive it. It is possible that observational signatures of self-destroyed civilizations could be detected, depending on the destruction scenario and the timing of human observation relative to it.

A related speculation by Sagan and Newman suggests that if other civilizations exist, and are transmitting and exploring, their signals and probes simply have not arrived yet. However, critics have noted that this is unlikely, since it requires that humanity&#x27;s advancement has occurred at a very special point in time, while the Milky Way is in transition from empty to full. This is a tiny fraction of the lifespan of a galaxy under ordinary assumptions, so the likelihood that humanity is in the midst of this transition is considered low in the paradox.

Some SETI skeptics may also believe that humanity is at a very special point of time—specifically, a transitional period from no space-faring societies to one space-faring society, namely that of human beings.

==== Intelligent life may exist hidden from view ====
Planetary scientist Alan Stern put forward the idea that there could be a number of worlds with subsurface oceans (such as Jupiter&#x27;s Europa or Saturn&#x27;s Enceladus). The surface would provide a large degree of protection from such things as cometary impacts and nearby supernovae, as well as creating a situation in which a much broader range of orbits are acceptable. Life, and potentially intelligence and civilization, could evolve. Stern states, &quot;If they have technology, and let&#x27;s say they&#x27;re broadcasting, or they have city lights or whatever—we can&#x27;t see it in any part of the spectrum, except maybe very-low-frequency [radio].&quot;

==== Advanced civilizations may limit their search for life to technological signatures ====
If life is abundant in the universe but the cost of space travel is high, an advanced civilization may choose to focus its search not on signs of life in general, but on those of other advanced civilizations, and specifically on radio signals. Since humanity has only recently began to use radio communication, its signals may have yet to arrive to other inhabited planets, and if they have, probes from those planets may have yet to arrive on Earth.

=== Willingness to communicate ===
==== Everyone is listening but no one is transmitting ====
Alien civilizations might be technically capable of contacting Earth, but could be only listening instead of transmitting. If all or most civilizations act in the same way, the galaxy could be full of civilizations eager for contact, but everyone is listening and no one is transmitting. This is the so-called &quot;SETI Paradox&quot;.

The only civilization known, humanity, does not explicitly transmit, except for a few small efforts. Even these efforts, and certainly any attempt to expand them, are controversial. It is not even clear humanity would respond to a detected signal—the official policy within the SETI community is that &quot;[no] response to a signal or other evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence should be sent until appropriate international consultations have taken place&quot;. However, given the possible impact of any reply, it may be very difficult to obtain any consensus on who would speak and what they would say.

==== Communication is dangerous ====

An alien civilization might feel it is too dangerous to communicate, either for humanity or for them. It is argued that when very different civilizations have met on Earth, the results have often been disastrous for one side or the other, and the same may well apply to interstellar contact. Even contact at a safe distance could lead to infection by computer code or even ideas themselves. Perhaps prudent civilizations actively hide not only from Earth but from everyone, out of fear of other civilizations.

Perhaps the Fermi paradox itself—or the alien equivalent of it—is the reason for any civilization to avoid contact with other civilizations, even if no other obstacles existed. From any one civilization&#x27;s point of view, it would be unlikely for them to be the first ones to make first contact. According to this reasoning, it is likely that previous civilizations faced fatal problems upon first contact and doing so should be avoided. So perhaps every civilization keeps quiet because of the possibility that there is a real reason for others to do so.

In 1987, science fiction author Greg Bear explored this concept in his novel &quot;The Forge of God&quot;. In &quot;The Forge of God&quot;, humanity is likened to a baby crying in a hostile forest: &quot;There once was an infant lost in the woods, crying its heart out, wondering why no one answered, drawing down the wolves.&quot; One of the characters explains, &quot;We&#x27;ve been sitting in our tree chirping like foolish birds for over a century now, wondering why no other birds answered. The galactic skies are full of hawks, that&#x27;s why. Planetisms that don&#x27;t know enough to keep quiet, get eaten.&quot;

In Liu Cixin&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;The Dark Forest&quot;, the author proposes a literary explanation for the Fermi paradox in which many multiple alien civilizations exist, but are both silent and paranoid, destroying any nascent lifeforms loud enough to make themselves known. This is because any other intelligent life may represent a future threat. As a result, Liu&#x27;s fictional universe contains a plethora of quiet civilizations which do not reveal themselves, as in a &quot;dark forest&quot;...filled with &quot;armed hunter(s) stalking through the trees like a ghost&quot;. This idea has come to be known as the dark forest hypothesis.

==== Earth is deliberately being avoided ====

The zoo hypothesis states that intelligent extraterrestrial life exists and does not contact life on Earth to allow for its natural evolution and development. A variation on the zoo hypothesis is the laboratory hypothesis, where humanity has been or is being subject to experiments, with Earth or the Solar System effectively serving as a laboratory. The zoo hypothesis may break down under the uniformity of motive flaw: all it takes is a single culture or civilization to decide to act contrary to the imperative within humanity&#x27;s range of detection for it to be abrogated, and the probability of such a violation of hegemony increases with the number of civilizations, tending not towards a &quot;Galactic Club&quot; with a unified foreign policy with regard to life on Earth but multiple &quot;Galactic Cliques&quot;. However, if artificial superintelligences dominate galactic life, and if it is true that such intelligences tend towards merged hegemonic behavior, then this would address the uniformity of motive flaw by dissuading rogue behavior.

Analysis of the inter-arrival times between civilizations in the galaxy based on common astrobiological assumptions suggests that the initial civilization would have a commanding lead over the later arrivals. As such, it may have established what has been termed the &quot;zoo hypothesis&quot; through force or as a galactic or universal norm and the resultant &quot;paradox&quot; by a cultural founder effect with or without the continued activity of the founder. Some colonization scenarios predict spherical expansion across star systems, with continued expansion coming from the systems just previously settled. It has been suggested that this would cause a strong selection process among the colonization front favoring cultural or biological adaptations to living in starships or space habitats. As a result, they may forgo living on planets. This may result in the destruction of terrestrial planets in these systems for use as building materials, thus preventing the development of life on those worlds. Or, they may have an ethic of protection for &quot;nursery worlds&quot;, and protect them.

It is possible that a civilization advanced enough to travel between solar systems could be actively visiting or observing Earth while remaining undetected or unrecognized. Following this logic, and building on arguments that other proposed solutions to the Fermi paradox may be implausible, Ian Crawford and Dirk Schulze-Makuch have argued that technological civilisations are either very rare in the Galaxy or are deliberately hiding from us.

==== Earth is deliberately being isolated ====

A related idea to the zoo hypothesis is that, beyond a certain distance, the perceived universe is a simulated reality. The planetarium hypothesis speculates that beings may have created this simulation so that the universe appears to be empty of other life.

=== Alien life is already here, unacknowledged ===
A significant fraction of the population believes that at least some UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) are spacecraft piloted by aliens. While most of these are unrecognized or mistaken interpretations of mundane phenomena, some occurrences remain puzzling even after investigation. The scientific consensus is that although they may be unexplained, they do not rise to the level of convincing evidence.

Similarly, it is theoretically possible that SETI groups are not reporting positive detections, or governments have been blocking signals or suppressing publication. This response might be attributed to security or economic interests from the potential use of advanced extraterrestrial technology. It has been suggested that the detection of an extraterrestrial radio signal or technology could well be the most highly secret information that exists. Claims that this has already happened are common in the popular press, but the scientists involved report the opposite experience—the press becomes informed and interested in a potential detection even before a signal can be confirmed.

Regarding the idea that aliens are in secret contact with governments, David Brin writes, &quot;Aversion to an idea, simply because of its long association with crackpots, gives crackpots altogether too much influence.&quot;

<doc id="11582" wikidata="Q9149" url="?curid=11582" title="Fundamentalism">
<text>Fundamentalism is a tendency among certain groups and individuals that are characterized by the application of a strict literal interpretation to scriptures, dogmas, or ideologies, along with a strong belief in the importance of distinguishing one&#x27;s ingroup and outgroup,
which leads to an emphasis on some conception of &quot;purity&quot;, and a desire to return to a previous ideal from which advocates believe members have strayed. The term is usually used in the context of religion to indicate an unwavering attachment to a set of irreducible beliefs (the &quot;fundamentals&quot;).

The term &quot;fundamentalism&quot; is generally regarded by scholars of religion as referring to a largely modern religious phenomenon which, while itself a reinterpretation of religion as defined by the parameters of modernism, reifies religion in reaction against modernist, secularist, liberal and ecumenical tendencies developing in religion and society in general that it perceives to be foreign to a particular religious tradition. Depending upon the context, the label &quot;fundamentalism&quot; can be a pejorative rather than a neutral characterization, similar to the ways that calling political perspectives &quot;right-wing&quot; or &quot;left-wing&quot; can have negative connotations.

==Religious fundamentalism==

===Buddhism===

Buddhist fundamentalism has targeted other religious and ethnic groups, as in Myanmar. A Buddhist-dominated country, Myanmar has seen tensions between Muslim minorities and the Buddhist majority, especially during the 2013 Burma anti-Muslim riots (possibly instigated by hardline groups such as the 969 Movement). as well as during actions which are associated with the Rohingya genocide (2016 onwards).

Buddhist fundamentalism also features in Sri Lanka. Buddhist-dominated Sri Lanka has seen recent tensions between Muslim minorities and the Buddhist majority, especially during the 2014 anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka and in the course of the 2018 anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka, allegedly instigated by hardline groups such as the Bodu Bala Sena.

Historic and contemporary examples of Buddhist fundamentalism occur in each of the three main branches of Buddhism: Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. In addition to the above examples of fundamentalism in Theravada-dominated societies, the reification of a protector deity, Dorje Shugden, by 19th-century Tibetan lama Pabongkhapa could be seen as an example of fundamentalism in the Vajrayana tradition. Dorje Shugden was a key tool in Pabongkhapa&#x27;s persecution of the flourishing Rimé movement, an ecumenical movement which fused the teachings of the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma, in response to the dominance of the Gelug school. While Pabongkhapa had an initially inclusive view early in his life, he received a number of signs that he had displeased Dorje Shugden by receiving teachings from non-Gelug schools, and thus initiated a revival movement that opposed the mixing of non-Gelug practices by Gelug practitioners. The main function of the deity was presented as &quot;the protection of the Ge-luk tradition through violent means, even including the killing of its enemies.&quot; Crucially, however, these &quot;‘enemies’ of the Gelug refers less to the members of rival
schools than to members of the Gelug tradition ‘who mix Dzong-ka-ba’s tradition with elements coming from other traditions, particularly the Nying-ma
Dzok-chen’.&quot;

In Japan, a prominent example has been the practice among some members of the Mahayana Nichiren sect of shakubuku – a method of proselytizing which involves the strident condemnation of other sects as deficient or evil.

===Christianity===
George Marsden has defined Christian fundamentalism as the demand for strict adherence to certain theological doctrines, in opposition to Modernist theology. Its supporters originally coined the term in order to describe what they claimed were five specific classic theological beliefs of Christianity, and the coinage of the term led to the development of a Christian fundamentalist movement within the Protestant community of the United States in the early part of the 20th century. Fundamentalism as a movement arose in the United States, starting among conservative Presbyterian theologians at Princeton Theological Seminary in the late 19th century. It soon spread to conservatives among the Baptists and other denominations around 1910 to 1920. The movement&#x27;s purpose was to reaffirm key theological tenets and defend them against the challenges of liberal theology and higher criticism.

The concept of &quot;fundamentalism&quot; has roots in the Niagara Bible Conferences which were held annually between 1878 and 1897. During those conferences, the tenets widely considered to be &quot;fundamental&quot; Christian belief were identified.

&quot;Fundamentalism&quot; was prefigured by &quot;The Fundamentals: A Testimony To The Truth&quot;, a collection of twelve pamphlets published between 1910 and 1915 by brothers Milton and Lyman Stewart. It is widely considered to be the foundation of modern Christian fundamentalism.

In 1910, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church identified what became known as the &quot;five fundamentals&quot;:
* Biblical inspiration and the infallibility of scripture as a result of this
* Virgin birth of Jesus
* Belief that Christ&#x27;s death was the atonement for sin
* Bodily resurrection of Jesus
* Historical reality of the miracles of Jesus

In 1920, the word &quot;fundamentalist&quot; was first used in print by Curtis Lee Laws, editor of &quot;The Watchman Examiner&quot;, a Baptist newspaper. Laws proposed that those Christians who were fighting for the fundamentals of the faith should be called &quot;fundamentalists&quot;.

Theological conservatives who rallied around the five fundamentals came to be known as &quot;fundamentalists&quot;. They rejected the existence of commonalities with theologically related religious traditions, such as the grouping of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism into one Abrahamic family of religions. By contrast, while Evangelical groups (such as the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association) typically agree with the &quot;fundamentals&quot; as they are expressed in &quot;The Fundamentals&quot;, they are often willing to participate in events with religious groups that do not hold to the &quot;essential&quot; doctrines.

===Ethnic tribal religions===

A few scholars label some indigenist revitalization movements within ethnic and indigenous religions who reject the changes brought by the modern states and major religions in favor of a return to traditional ways as fundamentalists in contrast with syncretic reform movements. Thus, numerous new generally fundamentalist Native American religious movements include the Pueblo Revolt (1680s), the Shawnee Prophet Movement (1805–1811), the Cherokee Prophet Movement (1811–1813), the Red Stick War (1813–1814), White Path&#x27;s Rebellion (1826), the Winnebago Prophet Movement (1830–1832), the first Ghost Dance (1869–1870) and the second Ghost Dance (1889–1890), and the Snake movements among the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Muscogee Creek peoples during the 1890s.

===Hinduism===

The existence of fundamentalism in Hinduism is a complex and contradictory phenomenon. While some would argue that certain aspects of Gaudiya Vaishnavism manifest fundamentalist tendencies, these tendencies are more clearly displayed in Hindutva, the predominant form of Hindu nationalism in India today, and an increasingly powerful and influential voice within the religion. Hinduism includes a diversity of ideas on spirituality and traditions, but has no ecclesiastical order, no unquestionable religious authorities, no governing body, no prophet(s) nor any binding holy book; Hindus can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, panentheistic, pandeistic, henotheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic or humanist. According to Doniger, &quot;ideas about all the major issues of faith and lifestyle – vegetarianism, nonviolence, belief in rebirth, even caste – are subjects of debate, not dogma.&quot;

Some would argue that, because of the wide range of traditions and ideas covered by the term Hinduism, a lack of theological &#x27;fundamentals&#x27; means that a dogmatic &#x27;religious fundamentalism&#x27; per se is hard to find. Others point to the recent rise of Hindu nationalism in India as evidence to the contrary. The religion &quot;defies our desire to define and categorize it.&quot; In India, the term “dharma” is preferred, which is broader than the Western term “religion.”

Hence, certain scholars argue that Hinduism lacks dogma and thus a specific notion of &quot;fundamentalism,&quot; while other scholars identify several politically active Hindu movements as part of a &quot;Hindu fundamentalist family.&quot;

===Islam===

Fundamentalism within Islam goes back to the early history of Islam in the 7th century, to the time of the Kharijites. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Shia and Sunni Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to &quot;takfir&quot;, whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.

The Shia and Sunni religious conflicts since the 7th century created an opening for radical ideologues, such as Ali Shariati (1933–77), to merge social revolution with Islamic fundamentalism, as exemplified by the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Islamic fundamentalism has appeared in many countries; the Salafi-Wahhabi version is promoted worldwide and financed by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Pakistan.

The Iran hostage crisis of 1979–80 marked a major turning point in the use of the term &quot;fundamentalism&quot;. The media, in an attempt to explain the ideology of Ayatollah Khomeini and the Iranian Revolution to a Western audience described it as a &quot;fundamentalist version of Islam&quot; by way of analogy to the Christian fundamentalist movement in the U.S. Thus was born the term &quot;Islamic fundamentalist&quot;, which became a common use of the term in following years.

===Judaism===
Jewish fundamentalism has been used to characterize militant religious Zionism, and both Ashkenazi and Sephardic versions of Haredi Judaism. Ian S. Lustik has characterized &quot;Jewish fundamentalism&quot; as &quot;an ultranationalist, eschatologically based, irredentist ideology&quot;.

===New Atheism===

The term &quot;New Atheism&quot; describes the positions of some atheist academics, writers, scientists, and philosophers of the 20th and 21st centuries. Critics have described New Atheism as &quot;secular fundamentalism&quot;.

==Politics==
In modern politics, fundamentalism has been associated with right-wing conservative ideology, especially social conservatism. Social conservatives often support policies in line with religious fundamentalism, such as support for school prayer and opposition to LGBT rights and abortion. Conversely, secularism has been associated with left-wing or liberal ideology, as it takes the opposite stance to said policies, however, various left-wing policies have likewise been deemed forms of fundamentalism, notably stronger forms of wokeness.

Political usage of the term &quot;fundamentalism&quot; has been criticized. It has been used by political groups to berate opponents, using the term flexibly depending on their political interests. According to Judith Nagata, a professor of Asia Research Institute in the National University of Singapore, &quot;The Afghan &quot;mujahiddin&quot;, locked in combat with the Soviet enemy in the 1980s, could be praised as &#x27;freedom fighters&#x27; by their American backers at the time, while the present Taliban, viewed, among other things, as protectors of American enemy Osama bin Laden, are unequivocally &#x27;fundamentalist&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;Fundamentalist&quot; has been used pejoratively to refer to philosophies perceived as literal-minded or carrying a pretense of being the sole source of objective truth, regardless of whether it is usually called a religion. For instance, the Archbishop of Wales has criticized &quot;atheistic fundamentalism&quot; broadly and said &quot;Any kind of fundamentalism, be it Biblical, atheistic or Islamic, is dangerous&quot;. He also said, &quot;the new fundamentalism of our age ... leads to the language of expulsion and exclusivity, of extremism and polarisation, and the claim that, because God is on our side, he is not on yours.&quot; He claimed it led to situations such as councils calling Christmas &quot;Winterval&quot;, schools refusing to put on nativity plays and crosses being removed from chapels. Others have countered that some of these attacks on Christmas are urban legends, not all schools do nativity plays because they choose to perform other traditional plays like &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; or &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; and, because of rising tensions between various religions, opening up public spaces to alternate displays rather than the Nativity scene is an attempt to keep government religion-neutral.

In &quot;The New Inquisition&quot;, Robert Anton Wilson lampoons the members of skeptical organizations such as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal as fundamentalist materialists, alleging that they dogmatically dismiss any evidence that conflicts with materialism as hallucination or fraud.

In France, during a protestation march against the imposition of restrictions on the wearing of headscarves in state-run schools, a banner labeled the ban as &quot;secular fundamentalism&quot;. In the United States, private or cultural intolerance of women wearing the hijab (Islamic headcovering) and political activism by Muslims also has been labeled &quot;secular fundamentalism&quot;.

The term &quot;fundamentalism&quot; is sometimes applied to signify a counter-cultural fidelity to a principle or set of principles, as in the pejorative term &quot;market fundamentalism&quot;, used to imply exaggerated religious-like faith in the ability of unfettered &quot;laissez-faire&quot; or free-market capitalist economic views or policies to solve economic and social problems. According to economist John Quiggin, the standard features of &quot;economic fundamentalist rhetoric&quot; are &quot;dogmatic&quot; assertions and the claim that anyone who holds contrary views is not a real economist. Retired professor in religious studies Roderick Hindery lists positive qualities attributed to political, economic, or other forms of cultural fundamentalism, including &quot;vitality, enthusiasm, willingness to back up words with actions, and the avoidance of facile compromise&quot; as well as negative aspects such as psychological attitudes, occasionally elitist and pessimistic perspectives, and in some cases literalism.

==Criticism==
A criticism by Elliot N. Dorff:
In order to carry out the fundamentalist program in practice, one would need a perfect understanding of the ancient language of the original text, if indeed the true text can be discerned from among variants. Furthermore, human beings are the ones who transmit this understanding between generations. Even if one wanted to follow the literal word of God, the need for people first to understand that word necessitates human interpretation. Through that process human fallibility is inextricably mixed into the very meaning of the divine word. As a result, it is impossible to follow the indisputable word of God; one can only achieve a human understanding of God&#x27;s will.

Howard Thurman was interviewed in the late 1970s for a BBC feature on religion. He told the interviewer:
Influential criticisms of fundamentalism include James Barr&#x27;s books on Christian fundamentalism and Bassam Tibi&#x27;s analysis of Islamic fundamentalism.

A study at the University of Edinburgh found that of its six measured dimensions of religiosity, &quot;lower intelligence is most associated with higher levels of fundamentalism.&quot;

== Use as a label ==
The Associated Press&#x27; &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; recommends that the term fundamentalist not be used for any group that does not apply the term to itself. Many scholars have adopted a similar position. Other scholars, however, use the term in the broader descriptive sense to refer to various groups in various religious traditions including those groups that would object to being classified as fundamentalists, such as in the Fundamentalism Project.

Tex Sample asserts that it is a mistake to refer to a Muslim, Jewish, or Christian fundamentalist. Rather, a fundamentalist&#x27;s fundamentalism is their primary concern, over and above other denominational or faith considerations.

<text>Show Me Love () is a 1998 Swedish romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Lukas Moodysson in his feature-length directorial debut. It stars Rebecka Liljeberg and Alexandra Dahlström as two seemingly disparate teenage girls who begin a tentative romantic relationship. The film was released theatrically in Sweden on 23 October 1998, and premiered internationally at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.

It received an overwhelmingly positive reception and won four Guldbagge Awards (Sweden&#x27;s official film awards) at the 1999 ceremony. Its international awards include the Teddy Award at the 1999 Berlin International Film Festival, and the Special Jury Prize at the 34th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. The film was selected as the Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 71st Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist.

The Swedish title refers to the small town of Åmål in Västra Götaland County, western Sweden. However, only a few scenes were filmed in Åmål, and they were not included in the final product. Primary filming took place in the nearby town of Trollhättan, the location of producing company Film i Väst&#x27;s studios.

==Plot==
Two girls, Agnes and Elin, attend school in the small town of Åmål, Sweden. Elin is outgoing and popular but finds her life unsatisfying and dull. Agnes, by contrast, has no real friends and is constantly depressed. Agnes is in love with Elin but cannot find any way to express it.

Agnes&#x27;s parents worry about their daughter&#x27;s reclusive life and try to be reassuring. Her mother decides, against Agnes&#x27;s will, to throw a 16th birthday party for her. Agnes is afraid no one will come. Viktoria, a girl in a wheelchair, shows up and Agnes shouts at her in front of her parents, telling her they are friends only because no one else will talk to them. Agnes, overcome with anger and depression, goes to her room and cries into her pillow shouting that she wishes she were dead, while her father tries to soothe her. Viktoria leaves and Agnes&#x27;s family eats the food made for the party.

Elin arrives at Agnes&#x27;s house, mainly as an excuse to avoid going to another party, where there will be a boy (Johan, played by Mathias Rust) she wants to avoid. Elin&#x27;s older sister, Jessica, who comes with her, dares her to kiss Agnes, who is rumoured to be a lesbian. Elin fulfills the dare and then runs out with Jessica, only to soon feel guilty for having humiliated Agnes.

After becoming drunk at the other party, Elin gets sick and throws up. Johan tries to help her and ends up professing his love to her. Elin leaves Johan and the party, only to return to Agnes&#x27;s house to apologize for how she acted earlier. In doing so, Elin stops Agnes from cutting herself. She even manages to persuade Agnes to return with her to the other party. On the way, Elin shares her real feelings about being trapped in Åmål. She asks Agnes about being a lesbian and believes that their problems could be solved by leaving Åmål and going to Stockholm. On impulse, Elin persuades Agnes to hitchhike to Stockholm, which is a five-hour journey by car. They find a driver who agrees to take them, believing them to be sisters who are visiting their grandmother. While sitting in the back seat, they have their first real kiss. The driver sees them and, shocked at the behaviour of the two &#x27;sisters&#x27;, orders them to leave the car.

Elin discovers that she is attracted to Agnes but is afraid to admit it. She proceeds to ignore Agnes and refuses to talk to her. Elin&#x27;s sister Jessica sees that she is in love and pushes her to figure out who it is. To cover the fact that she is in love with Agnes, Elin lies, pretending to be in love with Johan, and loses her virginity during a short-lived relationship with him. Elin eventually admits her feelings, when, after a climactic scene in a school bathroom, they are forced to &#x27;out&#x27; their relationship to the school.

The film ends with Elin and Agnes sitting in Elin&#x27;s bedroom drinking chocolate milk. Elin explains that she often adds too much chocolate until her milk is nearly black. She must fill another glass with milk and mix it and that her sister Jessica often gets mad that she finishes the chocolate. Elin has the last word saying &quot;It makes a lot of chocolate milk. But that doesn&#x27;t matter&quot;.

* Rebecka Liljeberg as Agnes Ahlberg
* Erica Carlson as Jessica Olsson
* Mathias Rust as Johan Hulth
* Stefan Hörberg as Markus
* Josefine Nyberg as Viktoria

==Title==
The original title of the film, &quot;Fucking Åmål&quot;, refers to the girls&#x27; feelings about their small town: In a key scene, Elin shouts in desperation &quot;varför måste vi bo i fucking jävla kuk-Åmål?&quot; (which roughly translates to &quot;why do we have to live in fucking bloody cock-Åmål?&quot;).

According to Moodysson, the problem with the original title started when the film was Sweden&#x27;s candidate for the Academy Awards, though eventually it was not chosen as a nominee. The Hollywood industry magazine &quot;Variety&quot; refused to run an advertisement for &quot;Fucking Åmål&quot;. Thus, American distributor Strand Releasing asked for a new title. Moodysson took the new title from the song at the end of the film, by Robyn. Distributors in other native English-speaking countries then followed suit. 
* (&quot;Discovering Love&quot;)
* (&quot;School Friends&quot;)
* (&quot;Love is Love&quot;) The Czech title is based on a Lucie Bílá song of the same name, which references homosexuality.
* (, &quot;Show Me Love&quot;)
* Hebrew: &quot;F- Åmål&quot;
* English: &quot;Show Me Love&quot;
* French (Canada): &quot;Qui Aimes-Tu?&quot; (&quot;Who do you love/like?&quot;)

==Reception==
===Political controversy===
Even before the film was completed, it created controversy in the town of Åmål. Local politicians campaigned to get the title changed because they argued that it would show the town in an unfair way and even undermine it as an economic centre. Further pressure was brought on the makers of the film, the Film i Väst studio, who are partly financed by Swedish local authorities, including Åmål.

However, the local complaints had no effect on the content or release of the film. Since the release, the town of Åmål has tried to embrace the publicity generated, despite the fact that the town&#x27;s name is missing from the English title. In the early 2000s the town founded the pop music &quot;Fucking Åmål Festival.&quot;

===Critical and commercial response===
&quot;Fucking Åmål&quot; received the highest audience figures for a Swedish film in 1998–9, with a total audience of 867,576 and a total audience for the whole of Europe of 2.1 million. It grossed $6.5 million in Sweden and $3 million in Norway. Some international reports stated that the film had outgrossed the Hollywood film &quot;Titanic&quot; in Sweden. In fact, &quot;Titanic&quot; had over twice as many viewers as &quot;Show Me Love&quot; in Sweden in 1998.

&quot;Show Me Love&quot; has an approval rating of 91% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 44 reviews, and an average rating of 7.5/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;A naturalistic depiction of teenage life, &quot;Show Me Love&quot; has a charming, authentic feel&quot;. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;generaly favorable reviews&quot;. It is among the top ten of the British Film Institute list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14.

The film received consistently good reviews, including the realism and credibility of its portrayal of what it is like to be a teenager in a small town in the 1990s. In addition, the efforts of the young actors were praised. Jan-Olov Andersson at Aftonbladet felt that Dahlström&#x27;s and Liljeberg&#x27;s imaginative appearance and interaction was &quot;sensationally credible&quot;, and Bo Ludvigsson at Svenska Dagbladet wrote that it was &quot;a warm, strong and confident film about the courage to be human&quot;. Ludvigsson also believed that &quot;Fucking Åmål&quot;, with its storytelling drive, leave and authenticity, was well above most of the Swedish films of recent years. Anders Hansson at Göteborgs-Posten thought that director Moodysson with fairly ordinary elements created &quot;a film with unusual rise&quot;.

Autostraddle placed it at number 20 on its &quot;Top 100 Best Lesbian Movies&quot; list.

===Cultural impact===
According to Russian singer Lena Katina, producer Ivan Shapovalov was inspired to create the pop duo t.A.T.u. after the release of this film. The track &quot;Show Me Love&quot; is featured in their album &quot;200 km/h in the Wrong Lane&quot;.

The creators of the 2018 Netflix series &quot;Everything Sucks!&quot; called the film the &quot;biggest influence&quot; on that show&#x27;s creation.

<text>In the field of computer security, independent researchers often discover flaws in software that can be abused to cause unintended behaviour; these flaws are called vulnerabilities. The process by which the analysis of these vulnerabilities is shared with third parties is the subject of much debate, and is referred to as the researcher&#x27;s &quot;disclosure policy&quot;. Full disclosure is the practice of publishing analysis of software vulnerabilities as early as possible, making the data accessible to everyone without restriction. The primary purpose of widely disseminating information about vulnerabilities is so that potential victims are as knowledgeable as those who attack them.
In his 2007 essay on the topic, Bruce Schneier stated &quot;Full disclosure – the practice of making the details of security vulnerabilities public – is a damned good idea. Public scrutiny is the only reliable way to improve security, while secrecy only makes us less secure.&quot; Leonard Rose, co-creator of an electronic mailing list that has superseded bugtraq to become the de facto forum for disseminating advisories, explains &quot;We don&#x27;t believe in security by obscurity, and as far as we know, full disclosure is the only way to ensure that everyone, not just the insiders, have access to the information we need.&quot;

== The vulnerability disclosure debate ==

The controversy around the public disclosure of sensitive information is not new. The issue of full disclosure was first raised in the context of locksmithing, in a 19th-century controversy regarding whether weaknesses in lock systems should be kept secret in the locksmithing community, or revealed to the public. Today, there are three major disclosure policies under which most others can be categorized: Non Disclosure, Coordinated Disclosure, and Full Disclosure.

The major stakeholders in vulnerability research have their disclosure policies shaped by various motivations, it is not uncommon to observe campaigning, marketing or lobbying for their preferred policy to be adopted and chastising those who dissent. Many prominent security researchers favor full disclosure, whereas most vendors prefer coordinated disclosure. Non disclosure is generally favored by commercial exploit vendors and blackhat hackers.

=== Coordinated vulnerability disclosure ===

Coordinated vulnerability disclosure is a policy under which researchers agree to report vulnerabilities to a coordinating authority, which then reports it to the vendor, tracks fixes and mitigations, and coordinates the disclosure of information with stakeholders including the public. In some cases the coordinating authority is the vendor. The premise of coordinated disclosure is typically that nobody should be informed about a vulnerability until the software vendor says it is time. While there are often exceptions or variations of this policy, distribution must initially be limited and vendors are given privileged access to nonpublic research.

The original name for this approach was &quot;responsible disclosure&quot;, based on the essay by Microsoft Security Manager Scott Culp “It&#x27;s Time to End Information Anarchy” (referring to full disclosure). Microsoft later called for the term to be phased out in favor of “Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure” (CVD).

Although the reasoning varies, many practitioners argue that end-users cannot benefit from access to vulnerability information without guidance or patches from the vendor, so the risks of sharing research with malicious actors is too great for too little benefit. As Microsoft explain, &quot;[Coordinated disclosure] serves everyone&#x27;s best interests by ensuring that customers receive comprehensive, high-quality updates for security vulnerabilities but are not exposed to malicious attacks while the update is being developed.&quot;

To prevent vendors to indefinitely delaying the disclosure, a common practice in the security industry, pioneered by Google, is to publish all the details of vulnerabilities after a deadline, usually 90 or 120 days reduced to 7 days if the vulnerability is under active exploitation.

=== Full disclosure ===

Full disclosure is the policy of publishing information on vulnerabilities without restriction as early as possible, making the information accessible to the general public without restriction. In general, proponents of full disclosure believe that the benefits of freely available vulnerability research outweigh the risks, whereas opponents prefer to limit the distribution.

The free availability of vulnerability information allows users and administrators to understand and react to vulnerabilities in their systems, and allows customers to pressure vendors to fix vulnerabilities that vendors may otherwise feel no incentive to solve. There are some fundamental problems with coordinated disclosure that full disclosure can resolve.

* If customers do not know about vulnerabilities, they cannot request patches, and vendors experience no economic incentive to correct vulnerabilities.
* Administrators cannot make informed decisions about the risks to their systems, as information on vulnerabilities is restricted.
* Malicious researchers who also know about the flaw have a long period of time to continue exploiting the flaw.

Discovery of a specific flaw or vulnerability is not a mutually exclusive event, multiple researchers with differing motivations can and do discover the same flaws independently.

There is no standard way to make vulnerability information available to the public, researchers often use mailing lists dedicated to the topic, academic papers or industry conferences.

=== Non disclosure ===

Non disclosure is the policy that vulnerability information should not be shared, or should only be shared under non-disclosure agreement (either contractually or informally).

Common proponents of non-disclosure include commercial exploit vendors, researchers who intend to exploit the flaws they find, and proponents of security through obscurity.

=== Debate ===
In 2009, Charlie Miller, Dino Dai Zovi and Alexander Sotirov announced at the CanSecWest conference the &quot;No More Free Bugs&quot; campaign, arguing that companies are profiting and taking advantage of security researchers by not paying them for disclosing bugs. This announcement made it to the news and opened a broader debate about the problem and its associated incentives.

==== Arguments against coordinated disclosure ====

Researchers in favor of coordinated disclosure believe that users cannot make use of advanced knowledge of vulnerabilities without guidance from the vendor, and that the majority is best served by limiting distribution of vulnerability information. Advocates argue that low-skilled attackers can use this information to perform sophisticated attacks that would otherwise be beyond their ability, and the potential benefit does not outweigh the potential harm caused by malevolent actors. Only when the vendor has prepared guidance that even the most unsophisticated users can digest should the information be made public.

This argument presupposes that vulnerability discovery is a mutually exclusive event, that only one person can discover a vulnerability. There are many examples of vulnerabilities being discovered simultaneously, often being exploited in secrecy before discovery by other researchers. While there may exist users who cannot benefit from vulnerability information, full disclosure advocates believe this demonstrates a contempt for the intelligence of end users. While it&#x27;s true that some users cannot benefit from vulnerability information, if they&#x27;re concerned with the security of their networks they are in a position to hire an expert to assist them as you would hire a mechanic to help with a car.

==== Arguments against non disclosure ====

Non disclosure is typically used when a researcher intends to use knowledge of a vulnerability to attack computer systems operated by their enemies, or to trade knowledge of a vulnerability to a third party for profit, who will typically use it to attack their enemies.

Researchers practicing non disclosure are generally not concerned with improving security or protecting networks. However, some proponents argue that they simply do not want to assist vendors, and claim no intent to harm others.

While full and coordinated disclosure advocates declare similar goals and motivations, simply disagreeing on how best to achieve them, non disclosure is entirely incompatible.

<doc id="11587" wikidata="Q1330520" url="?curid=11587" title="Feminist theology">
<text>Feminist theology is a movement found in several religions, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Sikhism, Jainism, Neopaganism, Baháʼí Faith, Judaism, Islam, Christianity, and New Thought, to reconsider the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of those religions from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting patriarchal (male-dominated) imagery and language about God, determining women&#x27;s place in relation to career and motherhood, studying images of women in the religions&#x27; sacred texts, and matriarchal religion.

== Methodology ==

===Development of feminist theology===
While there is no specific date to pinpoint the beginning of this movement, its origins can be traced back to the 1960s article, &quot;The Human Situation: A Feminine View&quot;, written by Valerie Saiving (Goldstein). Her piece of work questioned theologies written by men for men in a modern perspective to then dismantle what it had created over the years, patriarchal systems that oppress women. After Saiving&#x27;s work was published, many scholars took up her ideas and elaborated upon them, which built the feminist theology movement further. Grenz and Olson view the steps of feminist theology in threes: first, feminist theologians critique the treatment of women in the past, second, they determine alternative biblical/religious texts that support feminist ideologies, and third, they claim the theology that adheres to such standards, through reclamation, abolishment, and/or revision. Grenz and Olson also mention that while all feminists agree there is a flaw in the system, there is disagreement over how far outside of the Bible and the Christian tradition women are willing to go to seek support for their ideals. This concept is also important when feminist theology is relating to other religions or spiritual connections outside of Christianity.

===Prehistoric religion and archaeology===

The primacy of a monotheistic or near-monotheistic &quot;Great Goddess&quot; is advocated by some modern matriarchists as a female version of, preceding, or analogue to, the Abrahamic God associated with the historical rise of monotheism in the Mediterranean Axis Age.

Mother Nature (sometimes known as &quot;Mother Earth&quot;) is a common representation of nature that focuses on the life-giving and nurturing features of nature by embodying it in the form of the mother. Images of women representing mother earth, and mother nature, are timeless. In prehistoric times, goddesses were worshipped for their association with fertility, fecundity, and agricultural bounty. Priestesses held dominion over aspects of Incan, Assyrian, Babylonian, Slavonic, Roman, Greek, Indian, and Iroquoian religions in the millennia prior to the inception of patriarchy.

===Gender and God===

Others who practice feminist spirituality may instead adhere to a feminist re-interpretation of Western monotheistic traditions. In those cases, the notion of God as having a male gender is rejected, and God is not referred to using male pronouns. Feminist spirituality may also object to images of God that they perceive as authoritarian, parental, or disciplinarian, instead emphasizing &quot;maternal&quot; attributes such as nurturing, acceptance, and creativity.

Carol P. Christ is the author of the widely reprinted essay &quot;Why Women Need the Goddess&quot;, which argues in favor of the concept of there having been an ancient religion of a supreme goddess. This essay was presented as the keynote address to an audience of over 500 at the &quot;Great Goddess Re-emerging&quot; conference at the University of California at Santa Cruz in the spring of 1978, and was first published in &quot;Heresies: The Great Goddess Issue&quot; (1978), pgs. 8–13. Carol P. Christ also co-edited the classic feminist religion anthologies &quot;Weaving the Visions: New Patterns in Feminist Spirituality&quot; (1989) and &quot;Womanspirit Rising&quot; (1979/1989); the latter included her essay &quot;Why Women Need the Goddess&quot;.

The Latter-Day Saint movement is unique among Christian denominations in that it affirms the existence of a Divine Feminine as a part of its core doctrine. The Latter-Day Saint Divine Feminine is called &quot;Heavenly Mother&quot;. While Latter-day Saints do not pray to Heavenly Mother, she is considered to be the wife of Heavenly Father and therefore His equal in heaven, according to &quot;The Family: A Proclamation to the World&quot;&#x27;s description of husbands and wives as equal partners.

===New Thought movement===

New Thought as a movement had no single origin, but was rather propelled along by a number of spiritual thinkers and philosophers and emerged through a variety of religious denominations and churches, particularly the Unity Church, Religious Science, and Church of Divine Science. It was a feminist movement in that most of its teachers and students were women; notable among the founders of the movement were Emma Curtis Hopkins, known as the &quot;teacher of teachers&quot; Myrtle Fillmore, Malinda Cramer, and Nona L. Brooks; with its churches and community centers mostly led by women, from the 1880s to today.

== Within specific religions ==

===Baháʼí Faith===
===Judaism===

Jewish feminism is a movement that seeks to make the religious, political, and social status of Jewish women equal to that of Jewish men. Feminist movements, with varying approaches and successes, have opened up within all major denominations of Judaism.

There are different approaches and versions of feminist theology that exist within the Jewish community.

Some of these theologies promote the idea that it is important to have a feminine characterization of God within the siddur (Jewish prayerbook) and service. They challenge the male rabbi teachings that only emphasize God as a man with masculine traits only.

In 1976, Rita Gross published the article &quot;Female God Language in a Jewish Context&quot; (Davka Magazine 17), which Jewish scholar and feminist Judith Plaskow considers &quot;probably the first article to deal theoretically with the issue of female God-language in a Jewish context&quot;.  Gross was Jewish herself at this time.

Reconstructionist Rabbi Rebecca Alpert (&quot;Reform Judaism&quot;, Winter 1991) comments:
In 1990 Rabbi Margaret Wenig wrote the sermon, &quot;God Is a Woman and She Is Growing Older&quot;, which as of 2011 has been published ten times (three times in German) and preached by rabbis from Australia to California.

Rabbi Paula Reimers (&quot;Feminism, Judaism, and God the Mother&quot;, &quot;Conservative Judaism&quot; 46 (1993)) comments:
Ahuva Zache affirms that using both masculine and feminine language for God can be a positive thing, but reminds her Reform Jewish readership that God is beyond gender (&quot;Is God male, female, both or neither? How should we phrase our prayers in response to God&#x27;s gender?&quot;, in the Union for Reform Judaism&#x27;s iTorah, ):

These views are highly controversial even within liberal Jewish movements. Orthodox Jews and many Conservative Jews
hold that it is wrong to use English female pronouns for God, viewing such usage as an intrusion of modern, western feminist ideology into Jewish tradition. Liberal prayer books tend increasingly to also avoid male-specific words and pronouns, seeking that all references to God in translations be made in gender-neutral language. For example, the UK Liberal movement&#x27;s &quot;Siddur Lev Chadash&quot; (1995) does so, as does the UK Reform Movement&#x27;s &quot;Forms of Prayer&quot; (2008). In Mishkan T&#x27;filah, the American Reform Jewish prayer book released in 2007, references to God as &quot;He&quot; have been removed, and whenever Jewish patriarchs are named (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), so also are the matriarchs (Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah.) In 2015 the Reform Jewish High Holy Days prayer book Mishkan HaNefesh was released; it is intended as a companion to Mishkan T&#x27;filah. It includes a version of the High Holy Days prayer Avinu Malkeinu that refers to God as both &quot;Loving Father&quot; and &quot;Compassionate Mother&quot;. Other notable changes are replacing a line from the Reform movement&#x27;s earlier prayerbook, &quot;Gates of Repentance&quot;, that mentioned the joy of a bride and groom specifically, with the line &quot;rejoicing with couples under the chuppah [wedding canopy]&quot;, and adding a third, non-gendered option to the way worshippers are called to the Torah, offering &quot;mibeit&quot;, Hebrew for &quot;from the house of&quot;, in addition to the traditional &quot;son of&quot; or &quot;daughter of&quot;.

In 2003 &quot;The Female Face of God in Auschwitz: A Jewish Feminist Theology of the Holocaust&quot;, the first full-length feminist theology of the Holocaust, written by Melissa Raphael, was published. Judith Plaskow&#x27;s &quot;Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective&quot; (1991), and Rachel Adler&#x27;s &quot;Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics&quot; (1999) are the only two full-length Jewish feminist works to focus entirely on theology in general (rather than specific aspects such as Holocaust theology.) This work of feminist theology in regards to Judaism, also contextualizes the other goals of this movement, to re frame historical texts and how they are being taught. It is in addition to how God is being viewed but also the role of women historically and how they are being treated today in a new feminist light. 
While there is some opposition faced, Jewish communities believing feminism is too Western and does not validate Judaism, there is also the approval of an insider feminist perspective that takes into consideration traditions and modern thought.

===Christianity===

Christian feminism is an aspect of feminist theology which seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a Christian perspective. This is through reformation to be along the lines of feminist thought in regards to their religion. Christian feminists argue that contributions by women in that direction are necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity.

These theologians believe that God does not discriminate on the basis of biologically determined characteristics, such as sex and race. Their major issues include the ordination of women, male dominance in Christian marriage, recognition of equal spiritual and moral abilities, reproductive rights, and the search for a feminine or gender-transcendent divine. Christian feminists often draw on the teachings of more historical texts that reinforce that feminism does not go against Christianity but has always been in its texts.

Mary Daly grew up an Irish Catholic and all of her education was received through Catholic schools. She has three doctorate degrees, one from St. Mary&#x27;s College in sacred theology then two from University of Fribourg, Switzerland in theology and philosophy. While in her early works Daly expressed a desire to reform Christianity from the inside, she would later come to the conclusion that Christianity is not able to enact the necessary changes as it is. According to Ford&#x27;s The Modern Theologians, &quot;Mary Daly has done more than anyone to clarify the problems women have concerning the central core symbolism of Christianity, and its effects on their self-understanding and their relationship to God.&quot; Daly is a prime example of how some feminist theologians come to the conclusion that reclamation and reform are no longer a viable option, that condemnation is the only way out.

Rosemary Radford Ruether writes about crucial additional interpretations of how Christian feminist theology is impacted by the world. Ruether grew up Roman Catholic and attended Catholic schools through her sophomore year of high school. She was a classics major at Scripps College, worked for the Delta Ministry in 1965 and taught at Howard University School of Religion from 1966 to 1976. &quot;Rosemary Ruether has written on the question of Christian credibility, with particular attention to ecclesiology and its engagement with church-world conflicts; Jewish-Christian relations...; politics and religion in America; and Feminism&quot;. Ruether is said to be one of the major Christian feminist theologians of our time. Her book Sexism and God-Talk is the earliest feminist theological assessment of Christian theology.

In the 1970s Phyllis Trible pioneered a Christian feminist approach to biblical scholarship, using the approach of rhetorical criticism developed by her dissertation advisor, James Muilenburg.

Christian feminist theology has consistently been critiqued as being focused on primarily white women. This has resulted in the development of movements such as womanist theology, focusing on African American women coined by the works of Alice Walker, Asian feminist theology, and mujerista theology, introduced by Ada Maria Isasi-Diaz concerning Latinas.

The term Christian egalitarianism is sometimes preferred by those advocating gender equality and equity among Christians who do not wish to associate themselves with the feminist movement.
Women apologists have become more visible in Christian academia. Their defense of the faith is differentiated by a more personal, cultural and listening approach &quot;driven by love&quot;.

Some advocates of liberation theology will refer to God as &quot;she&quot;. This is particularly true of many of the faculty at Union Theological seminary which is a hub of liberation theology and even Senator Rafael Warnock referred to God as &quot;she&#x27; in his exegiesis of John 3.

===Islam===

Islamic feminism is a form of feminism concerned with the role of women in Islam. It aims for the full equality of all Muslims, regardless of gender, in public and private life. Islamic feminists advocate women&#x27;s rights, gender equality, and social justice grounded in an Islamic framework. Although rooted in Islam, the movement&#x27;s pioneers have also utilized secular and non-Muslim feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement. Advocates of the movement seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the Quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Qur&#x27;an (holy book), &quot;hadith&quot; (sayings of Muhammad) and &quot;sharia&quot; (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society. This is done through the advocation of the female autonomy in line with the guideline of the Qur&#x27;an. Feminist theologians like Azizah al-Hibri, professor of law at University of Richmond, founded KARAMAH: Muslim Women Lawyers for Human Rights. Feminist theology and Islam is also used to strengthen the spiritual connection to the women of Islam when they undergo severe trauma, to promote human rights especially those of women. Fatima Mernissi&#x27;s book, &quot;The Forgotten Queens of Islam&quot;, is a crucial piece in feminist theology for Islam and how it relates to a non western state.
Other theologists include Riffat Hassan, Amina Wadud, and Asma Barlas. 
This theology has been used to educate, re-frame religion, pose as a building block for peace, and the advancement of women&#x27;s rights, in legislation and in society.

===Sikhism===
In Sikhism women are equal to men. The verse from the Sikh scripture the Guru Granth Sahib states that:

According to scholars such as Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh, feminist theology in Sikhism is also the feminization of rituals such as the ceremonial rite of who lights a funeral pyre. Singh further states that this is the reclamation of religion to inspire &quot;personal and social renewal of change&quot; and that these theologians are seen as gurus rather than simply women or scholars. The teachings of Guru Nanak focus on the singularity between men and women, with anything that differs denounced. He cites the example that origins and traditions stem from women as supervisors and in control, as well as engaged in history, such as Mai Bhago, who rallied men to fight against imperial forces alongside her in the battle at Muktsar in 1705.

===Hinduism===

Within Ancient Hinduism, women have been held in equal honour as men. The Manusmriti for example states: &quot;The society that provides respect and dignity to women flourishes with nobility and prosperity. And a society that does not put women on such a high pedestal has to face miseries and failures regardless of how so much noble deeds they perform otherwise.&quot; Manusmriti Chapter 3 Verse 56.

Within the Vedas the Hindu holy texts, women were given the highest possible respect and equality. The Vedic period was glorified by this tradition. Many rishis were women, indeed so that several of them authored many of the slokas, a poem, proverb or hymn, in the Vedas. For instance, in the Rigveda there is a list of women rishis. Some of them are: Ghosha, Godha, Gargi, Vishwawra, Apala, Upanishad, Brahmjaya, Aditi, Indrani, Sarma, Romsha, Maitreyi, Kathyayini, Urvashi, Lopamudra, Yami, Shashwati, Sri, Laksha and many others. In the Vedic period women were free to enter into brahmacharya just like men, and attain salvation.

During Hindu marriage ceremonies, the following slokas are uttered by the grooms, yet in recent years their importance is understood less frequently with no active desire to analyze them in depth to come to the conclusions that was being portrayed:

&quot;O bride! I accept your hand to enhance our joint good fortune. I pray to you to accept me as your husband and live with me until our old age. ...&quot; &quot;Rigveda Samhita&quot; Part -4, sukta 85, sloka 9702

&quot;O bride! May you be like the empress of your mother-in-law, father-in-law, sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law (sisters and brothers of the groom). May your writ run in your house.&quot; &quot;Rigveda Samhita&quot; Part -4, sukta 85, sloka 9712

This sloka from the Atharvaveda clearly states that the woman leads and the man follows: &quot;The Sun God follows the first illuminated and enlightened goddess Usha (dawn) in the same manner as men emulate and follow women.&quot; &quot;Athravaveda Samhita&quot;, Part 2, Kanda 27, sukta 107, sloka 5705.

Women were considered to be the embodiment of great virtue and wisdom. Thus we have: &quot;O bride! May the knowledge of the Vedas be in front of you and behind you, in your center and in your ends. May you conduct your life after attaining the knowledge of the Vedas. May you be benevolent, the harbinger of good fortune and health and live in great dignity and indeed illuminate your husband&#x27;s home.&quot; &quot;Atharva Veda&quot; 14-1-64. Women were allowed full freedom of worship. &quot;The wife should do agnihotra (yagna), sandhya (puja) and all other daily religious rituals. If, for some reason, her husband is not present, the woman alone has full rights to do yagna&quot;. &quot;Rigveda Samhita&quot;, part 1, sukta 79, sloka 872.

Moving on towards the Monotheistic era of Hinduism when such ideals such as Shaivism and Vaishnavism, a specific deity for feministic worship was brought about under the Shaktism branch. From a Hinduism point of view women are equal in all measures to men in comparison, historical texts have stated this and is the basis of Hinduism, recognizing women as valuable and interconnected between men and women. Shakti, the name meaning power and referring to the female counterpart of Shiva, possesses connected powers that do not belong to just male or female but rather works together, equally dependent upon the other. Hindu feminist scholars also go beyond the reconstruction of texts but also the reestablishment of society and Hinduism in practice.

===Neopaganism===

Some currents of Neopaganism, in particular Wicca, have a ditheistic concept of a single goddess and a single god, who in hieros gamos represent a united whole. Polytheistic reconstructionists focus on reconstructing polytheistic religions, including the various goddesses and figures associated with indigenous cultures.

Wicca is a duo theistic belief system. Members of Wicca will work individually with both a God, the son and partner of the Mother Earth, and the Goddess herself. The Goddess is commonly referred to as the Triple Goddess in Wicca. She is also commonly addressed as the Mother Goddess or the Mother Earth. The Goddess represents creation, strength, destruction and the Earth at once. Wicca&#x27;s common theme across its beliefs is the feminist movement of the Female Goddess, which honours the importance of the female body.

Wiccan Feminism demonstrates the strength of women within the faith. Wicca&#x27;s history of leading women begins with examples of members such as Zsuzsanna Budapest (1940), who founded one of Wicca&#x27;s first feminist covens, has formed further feminist traditions within the faith over time. Wicca encourages a balance in power between men and women, regardless of gender and does not favour one gender over the other. Wicca does not shame femininity, but rather embraces and uplifts the female body. Members of the practice acknowledge the menstrual cycle as a powerful form of creation and life. Women are not shamed for being open about their sexuality and individualism, as Wicca considers menstruation, pregnancy and menopause to be manifestations of the divine feminine and a source of creation. The faith&#x27;s feminist approach and emphasis of a female deity creates an appeal to women, which has led to the majority of the Wiccan population being primarily female over the years. Wicca has a feminist approach to life as it encourages a theme of balance in power between men and women, highlighting the importance of equality in the faith.

The term &quot;thealogy&quot; is sometimes used in the context of the Neopagan Goddess movement, a pun on theology and &quot;thea&quot; θεά &quot;goddess&quot; intended to suggest a feminist approach to theism.

The Goddess movement is a loose grouping of social and religious phenomena that grew out of second-wave feminism, predominantly in North America, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand in the 1970s, and the metaphysical community as well. Spurred by the perception that women were not treated equitably in many religions, some women turned to a Female Deity as more in tune with their spiritual needs. Education in the Arts became a vehicle for the study of humanitarian philosophers like David Hume at that time. A unifying theme of this diverse movement is the femaleness of Deity (as opposed and contrasted to a patriarchal God).

Goddess beliefs take many forms: some people in the Goddess movement recognize multiple goddesses, some also include gods, while others honour what they refer to as &quot;the Goddess&quot;, which is not necessarily seen as monotheistic, but is often understood to be an inclusive, encompassing term incorporating many goddesses in many different cultures. The term &quot;the Goddess&quot; may also be understood to include a multiplicity of ways to view deity personified as female, or as a metaphor, or as a process. (Christ 1997, 2003) The term &quot;The Goddess&quot; may also refer to the concept of The One Divine Power, or the traditionally worshiped &quot;Great Goddess&quot; of ancient times.

In the latter part of the 20th century, feminism was influential in the rise of Neopaganism in the United States, and particularly the Dianic tradition. Some feminists find the worship of a goddess, rather than a god, to be consonant with their views. Others are polytheists, and worship a number of goddesses. The collective set of beliefs associated with this is sometimes known as thealogy and sometimes referred to as the Goddess movement. See also Dianic Wicca.

===Buddhism===
Buddhist feminism seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a Buddhist perspective and within Buddhism. While some core beliefs in Buddhism may cause friction with Western feminism, Buddhist feminist theology strives to find the common ground and balance between tradition and the goals of this movement. 
In carrying the teachings of Buddhism, feminist theologians critique the common feminist ideology as &quot;other-ing&quot; males. This idea is in conflict with Buddhist beliefs of interconnections between all. The enemy is not the &quot;other&quot; but the idea that there is not a singular connection and being the same. 
Buddhist feminist theologies take into consideration religious ideologies, challenge Western feminist views, and reclaim what Buddhism is at its core, interconnected and accepting.

<doc id="11592" wikidata="Q178285" url="?curid=11592" title="Freeware">
<text>Freeware is software, most often proprietary, that is distributed at no monetary cost to the end user. There is no agreed-upon set of rights, license, or EULA that defines &quot;freeware&quot; unambiguously; every publisher defines its own rules for the freeware it offers. For instance, modification, redistribution by third parties, and reverse engineering are permitted by some publishers but prohibited by others. Unlike with free and open-source software, which are also often distributed free of charge, the source code for freeware is typically not made available. Freeware may be intended to benefit its producer by, for example, encouraging sales of a more capable version, as in the freemium and shareware business models.

==History==
The term &quot;freeware&quot; was coined in 1982 by Andrew Fluegelman, who wanted to sell PC-Talk, the communications application he had created, outside of commercial distribution channels. Fluegelman distributed the program via the same process as &quot;shareware&quot;. As software types can change, freeware can change into shareware.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the term &quot;freeware&quot; was often applied to software released without source code.

==Definitions==

===Software license===

Freeware software is available for use without charge and typically has limited functionality with a more capable version available commercially or as shareware. It is typically fully functional for an unlimited period of time.

In contrast to what the Free Software Foundation calls free software, the author of freeware usually restricts the rights of the user to use, copy, distribute, modify, make derivative works, or reverse engineer the software. The software license may impose additional usage restrictions; for instance, the license may be &quot;free for private, non-commercial use&quot; only, or usage over a network, on a server, or in combination with certain other software packages may be prohibited. Restrictions may be required by license or enforced by the software itself; e.g., the package may fail to function over a network.

===Relation to other forms of software licensing===

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) defines &quot;open source software&quot; (i.e., free software or free and open-source software), as distinct from &quot;freeware&quot; or &quot;shareware&quot;; it is software where &quot;the Government does not have access to the original source code&quot;. The &quot;free&quot; in &quot;freeware&quot; refers to the price of the software, which is typically proprietary and distributed without source code. By contrast, the &quot;free&quot; in &quot;free software&quot; refers to freedoms granted users under the software license (for example, to run the program for any purpose, modify and redistribute the program to others), and such software may be sold at a price.

According to the Free Software Foundation (FSF), &quot;freeware&quot; is a loosely defined category and it has no clear accepted definition, although FSF asks that free software (libre; unrestricted and with source code available) should not be called freeware.
In contrast the Oxford English Dictionary simply characterizes freeware as being &quot;available free of charge (sometimes with the suggestion that users should make a donation to the provider)&quot;.

Some freeware products are released alongside paid versions that either have more features or less restrictive licensing terms. This approach is known as freemium (&quot;free&quot; + &quot;premium&quot;), since the &quot;free&quot; version is intended as a promotion for the premium version. The two often share a code base, using a compiler flag to determine which is produced. For example, BBEdit has a BBEdit Lite edition which has fewer features. XnView is available free of charge for personal use but must be licensed for commercial use. The &quot;free&quot; version may be advertising supported, as was the case with the DivX.

Ad-supported software and registerware also bear resemblances to freeware. Ad-supported software does not ask for payment for a license, but displays advertising to either cover development costs or as a means of income. Registerware forces the user to subscribe with the publisher before being able to use the product. While commercial products may require registration to ensure licensed use, registerware do not.

Shareware permits redistribution, but the license only allows limited use before paying the license fee. Some features may be disabled prior to payment, in which case it is sometimes known as crippleware.

Both freeware and shareware sometimes have a limited evaluation period, after which the software is automatically disabled or starts displaying a request to pay a registration fee. In the latter case it is colloquially known as nagware.

===Creative Commons licenses===

The Creative Commons offer licenses, applicable to all by copyright governed works including software, which allow a developer to define &quot;freeware&quot; in a legal safe and internationally law domains respecting way. The typical freeware use case &quot;share&quot; can be further refined with Creative Commons restriction clauses like non-commerciality (CC BY-NC) or no-derivatives (CC BY-ND), see description of licenses. There are several usage examples, for instance The White Chamber, Mari0 or Assault Cube, all freeware by being CC BY-NC-SA licensed with only non-commercial sharing allowed.

==Restrictions==
Freeware cannot economically rely on commercial promotion. In May 2015 advertising freeware on Google AdWords was restricted to &quot;authoritative source&quot;[s]. Thus web sites and blogs are the primary resource for information on which freeware is available, useful, and is not malware. However, there are also many computer magazines or newspapers that provide ratings for freeware and include compact discs or other storage media containing freeware. Freeware is also often bundled with other products such as digital cameras or scanners.

Freeware has been criticized as &quot;unsustainable&quot; because it requires a single entity to be responsible for updating and enhancing the product, which is then given away without charge. Other freeware projects are simply released as one-off programs with no promise or expectation of further development. These may include source code, as does free software, so that users can make any required or desired changes themselves, but this code remains subject to the license of the compiled executable and does not constitute free software.

== &quot;Free&quot; trial==

A &quot;free&quot; trial is another related concept in which customers are allowed to use a product, free of charge, for a limited time.

When a software monopoly has a strong network effect, it may be more profitable for it to offer a &quot;free&quot; trial. Also, customers acquired via a &quot;free&quot; trial have a much lower customer lifetime value as opposed to regular customers, but they also respond more to marketing communications.

Some factors that may encourage or discourage people to use &quot;free&quot; trials include:

* perceived usefulness
* perceived ease of use
* perceived risk
* social influence
* gender

<text>Flat Earth is an archaic and scientifically disproven conception of the Earth&#x27;s shape as a plane or disk. Many ancient cultures subscribed to a flat-Earth cosmography, notably including the cosmology in the ancient Near East. The model has undergone a recent resurgence as a conspiracy theory.

The idea of a spherical Earth appeared in ancient Greek philosophy with Pythagoras (6th century BC). However, the early Greek cosmological view of a flat Earth persisted among most pre-Socratics (6th–5th century BC). In the early 4th century BC, Plato wrote about a spherical Earth. By about 330 BC, his former student Aristotle had provided strong empirical evidence for a spherical Earth. Knowledge of the Earth&#x27;s global shape gradually began to spread beyond the Hellenistic world. By the early period of the Christian Church, the spherical view was widely held, with some notable exceptions. In contrast, ancient Chinese scholars consistently describe the Earth as flat, and this perception remained unchanged until their encounters with Jesuit missionaries in the 17th century. It is a historical myth that medieval Europeans generally thought the Earth was flat. This myth was created in the 17th century by Protestants to argue against Catholic teachings. Traditionalist Muslim scholars have maintained that the earth is flat, though, since the 9th century, Muslim scholars tended to believe in a spherical Earth. 

Despite the scientific facts and obvious effects of Earth&#x27;s sphericity, pseudoscientific flat-Earth conspiracy theories persist, and from the 2010s at latest, believers in a flat earth have increased, both as membership in modern flat Earth societies, and as unaffiliated individuals using social media. In a 2018 study reported on by &quot;Scientific American&quot;, only 82% of 18 to 24 year old American respondents agreed with the statement &quot;I have always believed the world is round&quot;. However, a firm belief in a flat Earth is rare, with less than 2% acceptance in all age groups.

==History==
===Belief in flat Earth===
====Near East====
In early Egyptian and Mesopotamian thought, the world was portrayed as a disk floating in the ocean. A similar model is found in the Homeric account from the 8th century BC in which &quot;Okeanos, the personified body of water surrounding the circular surface of the Earth, is the begetter of all life and possibly of all gods.&quot;

The Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts of ancient Egypt show a similar cosmography; Nun (the Ocean) encircled &quot;nbwt&quot; (&quot;dry lands&quot; or &quot;Islands&quot;).

The Israelites also imagined the Earth to be a disc floating on water with an arched firmament above it that separated the Earth from the heavens. The sky was a solid dome with the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars embedded in it.

====Greece====
=====Poets=====
Both Homer and Hesiod described a disc cosmography on the Shield of Achilles. This poetic tradition of an Earth-encircling (&quot;gaiaokhos&quot;) sea (Oceanus) and a disc also appears in Stasinus of Cyprus, Mimnermus, Aeschylus, and Apollonius Rhodius.

Homer&#x27;s description of the disc cosmography on the shield of Achilles with the encircling ocean is repeated far later in Quintus Smyrnaeus&#x27; &quot;Posthomerica&quot; (4th century AD), which continues the narration of the Trojan War.

=====Philosophers=====

Several pre-Socratic philosophers believed that the world was flat: Thales (c. 550 BC) according to several sources, and Leucippus (c. 440 BC) and Democritus (c. 460–370 BC) according to Aristotle.

Thales thought that the Earth floated in water like a log. It has been argued, however, that Thales actually believed in a spherical Earth. Anaximander (c. 550 BC) believed that the Earth was a short cylinder with a flat, circular top that remained stable because it was the same distance from all things. Anaximenes of Miletus believed that &quot;the Earth is flat and rides on air; in the same way the Sun and the Moon and the other heavenly bodies, which are all fiery, ride the air because of their flatness&quot;. Xenophanes (c. 500 BC) thought that the Earth was flat, with its upper side touching the air, and the lower side extending without limit.

Belief in a flat Earth continued into the 5th century BC. Anaxagoras (c. 450 BC) agreed that the Earth was flat, and his pupil Archelaus believed that the flat Earth was depressed in the middle like a saucer, to allow for the fact that the Sun does not rise and set at the same time for everyone.

=====Historians=====
Hecataeus of Miletus believed that the Earth was flat and surrounded by water. Herodotus in his &quot;Histories&quot; ridiculed the belief that water encircled the world, yet most classicists agree that he still believed Earth was flat because of his descriptions of literal &quot;ends&quot; or &quot;edges&quot; of the Earth.

====Northern Europe====
The ancient Norse and Germanic peoples believed in a flat-Earth cosmography with the Earth surrounded by an ocean, with the axis mundi, a world tree (Yggdrasil), or pillar (Irminsul) in the centre. In the world-encircling ocean sat a snake called Jormungandr. The Norse creation account preserved in Gylfaginning (VIII) states that during the creation of the Earth, an impassable sea was placed around it:
The late Norse Konungs skuggsjá, on the other hand, explains Earth&#x27;s shape as a sphere:
====East Asia====

In ancient China, the prevailing belief was that the Earth was flat and square, while the heavens were round, an assumption virtually unquestioned until the introduction of European astronomy in the 17th century. The English sinologist Cullen emphasizes the point that there was no concept of a round Earth in ancient Chinese astronomy:

The model of an egg was often used by Chinese astronomers such as Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) to describe the heavens as spherical:
This analogy with a curved egg led some modern historians, notably Joseph Needham, to conjecture that Chinese astronomers were, after all, aware of the Earth&#x27;s sphericity. The egg reference, however, was rather meant to clarify the relative position of the flat Earth to the heavens:
Further examples cited by Needham supposed to demonstrate dissenting voices from the ancient Chinese consensus actually refer without exception to the Earth being square, not to it being flat. Accordingly, the 13th-century scholar Li Ye, who argued that the movements of the round heaven would be hindered by a square Earth, did not advocate a spherical Earth, but rather that its edge should be rounded off so as to be circular. However, Needham disagrees, affirming that Li Ye believed the Earth to be spherical, similar in shape to the heavens but much smaller. This was preconceived by the 4th-century scholar Yu Xi, who argued for the infinity of outer space surrounding the Earth and that the latter could be either square or round, in accordance to the shape of the heavens. When Chinese geographers of the 17th century, influenced by European cartography and astronomy, showed the Earth as a sphere that could be circumnavigated by sailing around the globe, they did so with formulaic terminology previously used by Zhang Heng to describe the spherical shape of the Sun and Moon (i.e. that they were as round as a crossbow bullet).

As noted in the book &quot;Huainanzi&quot;, in the 2nd century BC, Chinese astronomers effectively inverted Eratosthenes&#x27; calculation of the curvature of the Earth to calculate the height of the Sun above the Earth. By assuming the Earth was flat, they arrived at a distance of (approximately ). The &quot;Zhoubi Suanjing&quot; also discusses how to determine the distance of the Sun by measuring the length of noontime shadows at different latitudes, a method similar to Eratosthenes&#x27; measurement of the circumference of the Earth, but the &quot;Zhoubi Suanjing&quot; assumes that the Earth is flat.

===Alternate or mixed theories===
====Greece: spherical Earth====

Pythagoras in the 6th century BC and Parmenides in the 5th century BC stated that the Earth is spherical, and this view spread rapidly in the Greek world. Around 330 BC, Aristotle maintained on the basis of physical theory and observational evidence that the Earth was spherical, and reported an estimate of its circumference. The Earth&#x27;s circumference was first determined around 240 BC by Eratosthenes. By the 2nd century AD, Ptolemy had derived his maps from a globe and developed the system of latitude, longitude, and climes. His &quot;Almagest&quot; was written in Greek and only translated into Latin in the 11th century from Arabic translations.

Lucretius (1st century BC) opposed the concept of a spherical Earth, because he considered that an infinite universe had no center towards which heavy bodies would tend. Thus, he thought the idea of animals walking around topsy-turvy under the Earth was absurd. By the 1st century AD, Pliny the Elder was in a position to say that everyone agreed on the spherical shape of Earth, though disputes continued regarding the nature of the antipodes, and how it is possible to keep the ocean in a curved shape.

====South Asia====

The Vedic texts depict the cosmos in many ways. One of the earliest Indian cosmological texts pictures the Earth as one of a stack of flat disks.

In the Vedic texts, Dyaus (heaven) and Prithvi (Earth) are compared to wheels on an axle, yielding a flat model. They are also described as bowls or leather bags, yielding a concave model. According to Macdonell: &quot;the conception of the Earth being a disc surrounded by an ocean does not appear in the Samhitas. But it was naturally regarded as circular, being compared with a wheel (10.89) and expressly called circular (parimandala) in the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot;.&quot;

By about the 5th century AD, the &quot;siddhanta&quot; astronomy texts of South Asia, particularly of Aryabhata, assume a spherical Earth as they develop mathematical methods for quantitative astronomy for calendar and time keeping.

The medieval Indian texts called the Puranas describe the Earth as a flat-bottomed, circular disk with concentric oceans and continents. This general scheme is present not only in the Hindu cosmologies, but also in Buddhist and Jain cosmologies of South Asia. However, some Puranas include other models. The fifth canto of the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, for example, includes sections that describe the Earth both as flat and spherical.

====Early Christian Church====
During the early period of the Christian Church, the spherical view continued to be widely held, with some notable exceptions.
Athenagoras, an eastern Christian writing around the year 175 AD, said that the Earth was spherical. Methodius (c. 290 AD), an eastern Christian writing against &quot;the theory of the Chaldeans and the Egyptians&quot; said: &quot;Let us first lay bare ... the theory of the Chaldeans and the Egyptians. They say that the circumference of the universe is likened to the turnings of a well-rounded globe, the Earth being a central point. They say that since its outline is spherical, ... the Earth should be the center of the universe, around which the heaven is whirling.&quot; Lactantius, a western Christian writer and advisor to the first Christian Roman Emperor, Constantine, writing sometime between 304 and 313 AD, ridiculed the notion of &quot;antipodes&quot; and the philosophers who fancied that &quot;the universe is round like a ball. They also thought that heaven revolves in accordance with the motion of the heavenly bodies. ... For that reason, they constructed brass globes, as though after the figure of the universe.&quot; Arnobius, another eastern Christian writing sometime around 305 AD, described the round Earth: &quot;In the first place, indeed, the world itself is neither right nor left. It has neither upper nor lower regions, nor front nor back. For whatever is round and bounded on every side by the circumference of a solid sphere, has no beginning or end ...&quot;

The influential theologian and philosopher Saint Augustine, one of the four Great Church Fathers of the Western Church, similarly objected to the &quot;fable&quot; of antipodes:
Some historians do not view Augustine&#x27;s scriptural commentaries as endorsing any particular cosmological model, endorsing instead the view that Augustine shared the common view of his contemporaries that the Earth is spherical, in line with his endorsement of science in &quot;De Genesi ad litteram&quot;. C. P. E. Nothaft, responding to writers like Leo Ferrari who described Augustine as endorsing a flat Earth, says that &quot;...other recent writers on the subject treat Augustine&#x27;s acceptance of the earth&#x27;s spherical shape as a well-established fact&quot;.
Diodorus of Tarsus, a leading figure in the School of Antioch and mentor of John Chrysostom, may have argued for a flat Earth; however, Diodorus&#x27; opinion on the matter is known only from a later criticism. Chrysostom, one of the four Great Church Fathers of the Eastern Church and Archbishop of Constantinople, explicitly espoused the idea, based on scripture, that the Earth floats miraculously on the water beneath the firmament.

&quot;Christian Topography&quot; (547) by the Alexandrian monk Cosmas Indicopleustes, who had traveled as far as Sri Lanka and the source of the Blue Nile, is now widely considered the most valuable geographical document of the early medieval age, although it received relatively little attention from contemporaries. In it, the author repeatedly expounds the doctrine that the universe consists of only two places, the Earth below the firmament and heaven above it. Carefully drawing on arguments from scripture, he describes the Earth as a rectangle, 400 days&#x27; journey long by 200 wide, surrounded by four oceans and enclosed by four massive walls which support the firmament. The spherical Earth theory is contemptuously dismissed as &quot;pagan&quot;.

Severian, Bishop of Gabala ( 408), wrote that the Earth is flat and the Sun does not pass under it in the night, but &quot;travels through the northern parts as if hidden by a wall&quot;. Basil of Caesarea (329–379) argued that the matter was theologically irrelevant.

====Europe: Early Middle Ages====
Early medieval Christian writers felt little urge to assume flatness of the Earth, though they had fuzzy impressions of the writings of Ptolemy and Aristotle, relying more on Pliny.

With the end of the Western Roman Empire, Western Europe entered the Middle Ages with great difficulties that affected the continent&#x27;s intellectual production. Most scientific treatises of classical antiquity (in Greek) were unavailable, leaving only simplified summaries and compilations. In contrast, the Eastern Roman Empire did not fall, and it preserved the learning. Still, many textbooks of the Early Middle Ages supported the sphericity of the Earth in the western part of Europe.

Europe&#x27;s view of the shape of the Earth in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages may be best expressed by the writings of early Christian scholars:

Bishop Isidore of Seville (560–636) taught in his widely read encyclopedia, the &quot;Etymologies&quot;, diverse views such as that the Earth &quot;resembles a wheel&quot; resembling Anaximander in language and the map that he provided. This was widely interpreted as referring to a disc-shaped Earth. An illustration from Isidore&#x27;s &quot;De Natura Rerum&quot; shows the five zones of the Earth as adjacent circles. Some have concluded that he thought the Arctic and Antarctic zones were adjacent to each other. He did not admit the possibility of antipodes, which he took to mean people dwelling on the opposite side of the Earth, considering them legendary and noting that there was no evidence for their existence. Isidore&#x27;s T and O map, which was seen as representing a small part of a spherical Earth, continued to be used by authors through the Middle Ages, e.g. the 9th-century bishop Rabanus Maurus, who compared the habitable part of the northern hemisphere (Aristotle&#x27;s northern temperate clime) with a wheel. At the same time, Isidore&#x27;s works also gave the views of sphericity, for example, in chapter 28 of &quot;De Natura Rerum&quot;, Isidore claims that the Sun orbits the Earth and illuminates the other side when it is night on this side. See French translation of &quot;De Natura Rerum&quot;. In his other work &quot;Etymologies&quot;, there are also affirmations that the sphere of the sky has Earth in its center and the sky being equally distant on all sides. Other researchers have argued these points as well. &quot;The work remained unsurpassed until the thirteenth century and was regarded as the summit of all knowledge. It became an essential part of European medieval culture. Soon after the invention of typography it appeared many times in print.&quot; However, &quot;The Scholastics – later medieval philosophers, theologians, and scientists – were helped by the Arabic translators and commentaries, but they hardly needed to struggle against a flat-Earth legacy from the early middle ages (500–1050). Early medieval writers often had fuzzy and imprecise impressions of both Ptolemy and Aristotle and relied more on Pliny, but they felt (with one exception), little urge to assume flatness.&quot;

St Vergilius of Salzburg (c. 700–784), in the middle of the 8th century, discussed or taught some geographical or cosmographical ideas that St Boniface found sufficiently objectionable that he complained about them to Pope Zachary. The only surviving record of the incident is contained in Zachary&#x27;s reply, dated 748, where he wrote:
Some authorities have suggested that the sphericity of the Earth was among the aspects of Vergilius&#x27;s teachings that Boniface and Zachary considered objectionable. Others have considered this unlikely, and take the wording of Zachary&#x27;s response to indicate at most an objection to belief in the existence of humans living in the antipodes. In any case, there is no record of any further action having been taken against Vergilius. He was later appointed bishop of Salzburg and was canonised in the 13th century.
A possible non-literary but graphic indication that people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth (or perhaps the world) was a sphere is the use of the &quot;orb&quot; (globus cruciger) in the regalia of many kingdoms and of the Holy Roman Empire. It is attested from the time of the Christian late-Roman emperor Theodosius II (423) throughout the Middle Ages; the &quot;Reichsapfel&quot; was used in 1191 at the coronation of emperor Henry VI. However the word means &quot;circle&quot;, and there is no record of a globe as a representation of the Earth since ancient times in the west until that of Martin Behaim in 1492. Additionally it could well be a representation of the entire &quot;world&quot; or cosmos.

A recent study of medieval concepts of the sphericity of the Earth noted that &quot;since the eighth century, no cosmographer worthy of note has called into question the sphericity of the Earth&quot;. However, the work of these intellectuals may not have had significant influence on public opinion, and it is difficult to tell what the wider population may have thought of the shape of the Earth if they considered the question at all.

====Europe: High and Late Middle Ages====
Hermann of Reichenau (1013–1054) was among the earliest Christian scholars to estimate the circumference of Earth with Eratosthenes&#x27; method. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), the most widely taught theologian of the Middle Ages, believed in a spherical Earth and took for granted that his readers also knew the Earth is round. Lectures in the medieval universities commonly advanced evidence in favor of the idea that the Earth was a sphere.
Jill Tattersall shows that in many vernacular works in 12th- and 13th-century French texts the Earth was considered &quot;round like a table&quot; rather than &quot;round like an apple&quot;. She writes, &quot;[I]n virtually all the examples quoted ... from epics and from non-&#x27;historical&#x27; romances (that is, works of a less learned character) the actual form of words used suggests strongly a circle rather than a sphere&quot;, though she notes that even in these works the language is ambiguous.

Portuguese navigation down and around the coast of Africa in the latter half of the 1400s gave wide-scale observational evidence for Earth&#x27;s sphericity. In these explorations, the Sun&#x27;s position moved more northward the further south the explorers travelled. Its position directly overhead at noon gave evidence for crossing the equator. These apparent solar motions in detail were more consistent with north–south curvature and a distant Sun, than with any flat-Earth explanation. The ultimate demonstration came when Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s expedition completed the first global circumnavigation in 1521. Antonio Pigafetta, one of the few survivors of the voyage, recorded the loss of a day in the course of the voyage, giving evidence for east–west curvature.

====Middle East: Islamic scholars====

Prior to the introduction of Greek cosmology into the Islamic world, Muslims tended to view the Earth as flat, and Muslim traditionalists who rejected Greek philosophy continued to hold to this view later on while various theologians held opposing opinions. Beginning in the 10th century onwards, some Muslim traditionalists began to adopt the notion of a spherical Earth with the influence of Greek and Ptolemaic cosmology.

In Quranic cosmology, the Earth (&quot;al-arḍ&quot;) was &quot;spread out.&quot; Whether or not this implies a flat earth was debated by Muslims. Some modern historians believe the Quran saw the world as flat. On the other hand, the 12th-century commentary, the Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi) by Fakhr al-Din al-Razi argues that though this verse does describe a flat surface, it is limited in its application to local regions of the Earth which are roughly flat as opposed to the Earth as a whole. Others who would support a ball-shaped Earth included Ibn Hazm.

====Ming Dynasty in China====
A spherical terrestrial globe was introduced to Yuan-era Khanbaliq (i.e. Beijing) in 1267 by the Persian astronomer Jamal ad-Din, but it is not known to have made an impact on the traditional Chinese conception of the shape of the Earth. As late as 1595, an early Jesuit missionary to China, Matteo Ricci, recorded that the Ming-dynasty Chinese say: &quot;The Earth is flat and square, and the sky is a round canopy; they did not succeed in conceiving the possibility of the antipodes.&quot;

In the 17th century, the idea of a spherical Earth spread in China due to the influence of the Jesuits, who held high positions as astronomers at the imperial court. Matteo Ricci, in collaboration with Chinese cartographers and translator Li Zhizao, published the &quot;Kunyu Wanguo Quantu&quot; in 1602, the first Chinese world map based on European discoveries. The astronomical and geographical treatise &quot;Gezhicao&quot; () written in 1648 by Xiong Mingyu () explained that the Earth was spherical, not flat or square, and could be circumnavigated.

=== Myth of flat-Earth prevalence ===

In the 19th century, a historical myth arose which held that the predominant cosmological doctrine during the Middle Ages was that the Earth was flat. An early proponent of this myth was the American writer Washington Irving, who maintained that Christopher Columbus had to overcome the opposition of churchmen to gain sponsorship for his voyage of exploration. Later significant advocates of this view were John William Draper and Andrew Dickson White, who used it as a major element in their advocacy of the thesis that there was a long-lasting and essential conflict between science and religion. Some studies of the historical connections between science and religion have demonstrated that theories of their mutual antagonism ignore examples of their mutual support.

Subsequent studies of medieval science have shown that most scholars in the Middle Ages, including those read by Christopher Columbus, maintained that the Earth was spherical.

==Modern flat Earth beliefs==
In the modern era, the pseudoscientific belief in a flat Earth originated with the English writer Samuel Rowbotham with the 1849 pamphlet &quot;Zetetic Astronomy&quot;. Lady Elizabeth Blount established the Universal Zetetic Society in 1893, which published journals. In 1956, Samuel Shenton set up the International Flat Earth Research Society, better known as the &quot;Flat Earth Society&quot; from Dover, England, as a direct descendant of the Universal Zetetic Society.

In the Internet era, the availability of communications technology and social media like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter have made it easy for individuals, famous or not, to spread disinformation and attract others to erroneous ideas, including that of the flat Earth.

Modern believers in a flat Earth face overwhelming publicly accessible evidence of Earth&#x27;s sphericity. They also need to explain why governments, media outlets, schools, scientists, surveyors, airlines and other organizations accept that the world is spherical. To satisfy these tensions and maintain their beliefs, they generally embrace some form of conspiracy theory. In addition, believers tend to not trust observations they have not made themselves, and often distrust, disagree with or accuse each other of being in league with conspiracies.

== Education ==
Before learning from their social environment, a child&#x27;s perception of their physical environment often leads to a false concept about the shape of Earth and what happens beyond the horizon. Many children think that Earth ends there and that one can fall off the edge. Education helps them gradually change their belief into a realist one of a spherical Earth.

<text>Persian ( ), also known by its endonym Farsi (, Fārsī ), is a Western Iranian language belonging to the Iranian branch of the Indo-Iranian subdivision of the Indo-European languages. Persian is a pluricentric language predominantly spoken and used officially within Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan in three mutually intelligible standard varieties, respectively Iranian Persian (officially known as &quot;Persian&quot;), Dari Persian (officially known as &quot;Dari&quot; since 1964), and Tajiki Persian (officially known as &quot;Tajik&quot; since 1999). It is also spoken natively in the Tajik variety by a significant population within Uzbekistan, as well as within other regions with a Persianate history in the cultural sphere of Greater Iran. It is written officially within Iran and Afghanistan in the Persian alphabet, a derivative of the Arabic script, and within Tajikistan in the Tajik alphabet, a derivative of the Cyrillic script.

Modern Persian is a continuation of Middle Persian, an official language of the Sasanian Empire (224–651 CE), itself a continuation of Old Persian, which was used in the Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BCE). It originated in the region of Fars (Persia) in southwestern Iran. Its grammar is similar to that of many European languages.

Throughout history, Persian was considered prestigious by various empires centered in West Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia. Old Persian is attested in Old Persian cuneiform on inscriptions from between the 6th and 4th century BC. Middle Persian is attested in Aramaic-derived scripts (Pahlavi and Manichaean) on inscriptions and in Zoroastrian and Manichaean scriptures from between the third to the tenth centuries (see Middle Persian literature). New Persian literature was first recorded in the ninth century, after the Muslim conquest of Persia, since then adopting the Perso-Arabic script.

Persian was the first language to break through the monopoly of Arabic on writing in the Muslim world, with Persian poetry becoming a tradition in many eastern courts. It was used officially as a language of bureaucracy even by non-native speakers, such as the Ottomans in Anatolia, the Mughals in South Asia, and the Pashtuns in Afghanistan. It influenced languages spoken in neighboring regions and beyond, including other Iranian languages, the Turkic, Armenian, Georgian, &amp; Indo-Aryan languages. It also exerted some influence on Arabic, while borrowing a lot of vocabulary from it in the Middle Ages.

Some of the world&#x27;s most famous pieces of literature from the Middle Ages, such as the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; by Ferdowsi, the works of Rumi, the &quot;Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám&quot;, the of Nizami Ganjavi, &quot;The Divān&quot; of Hafez, &quot;The Conference of the Birds&quot; by Attar of Nishapur, and the miscellanea of &quot;Gulistan&quot; and &quot;Bustan&quot; by Saadi Shirazi, are written in Persian. Some of the prominent modern Persian poets were Nima Yooshij, Ahmad Shamlou, Simin Behbahani, Sohrab Sepehri, Rahi Mo&#x27;ayyeri, Mehdi Akhavan-Sales, and Forugh Farrokhzad.

There are approximately 130 million Persian speakers worldwide, including Persians, Lurs, Tajiks, Hazaras, Iranian Azeris, Iranian Kurds, Balochs, Tats, Afghan Pashtuns, and Aimaqs. The term &quot;Persophone&quot; might also be used to refer to a speaker of Persian.

==Classification==
Persian is a member of the Western Iranian group of the Iranian languages, which make up a branch of the Indo-European languages in their Indo-Iranian subdivision. The Western Iranian languages themselves are divided into two subgroups: Southwestern Iranian languages, of which Persian is the most widely spoken, and Northwestern Iranian languages, of which Kurdish and Balochi are the most widely spoken.

==Name==
The term &quot;Persian&quot; is an English derivation of Latin , the adjectival form of , itself deriving from Greek (), a Hellenized form of Old Persian (), which means &quot;Persia&quot; (a region in southwestern Iran, corresponding to modern-day Fars). According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the term &quot;Persian&quot; as a language name is first attested in English in the mid-16th century.

&#x27;, which is the Persian word for the Persian language, has also been used widely in English in recent decades, more often to refer to Iran&#x27;s standard Persian. However, the name &quot;Persian&quot; is still more widely used. The Academy of Persian Language and Literature has maintained that the endonym &#x27; is to be avoided in foreign languages, and that &quot;Persian&quot; is the appropriate designation of the language in English, as it has the longer tradition in western languages and better expresses the role of the language as a mark of cultural and national continuity. Iranian historian and linguist Ehsan Yarshater, founder of the &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot; and Columbia University&#x27;s Center for Iranian Studies, mentions the same concern in an academic journal on Iranology, rejecting the use of &quot;&quot; in foreign languages.

Etymologically, the Persian term derives from its earlier form ( in Middle Persian), which in turn comes from the same root as the English term &quot;Persian&quot;. In the same process, the Middle Persian toponym (&quot;Persia&quot;) evolved into the modern name Fars. The phonemic shift from to is due to the influence of Arabic in the Middle Ages, and is because of the lack of the phoneme in Standard Arabic.

===Standard varieties&#x27; names===
The standard Persian of Iran has been called, apart from &quot;Persian&quot; and &quot;Farsi&quot;, by names such as &quot;Iranian Persian&quot; and &quot;Western Persian&quot;, exclusively. The official language of Iran is designated simply as &quot;Persian&quot; (, ).

The standard Persian of Afghanistan has been officially named &quot;Dari&quot; (, ) since 1958. Also referred to as &quot;Afghan Persian&quot; in English, it is one of Afghanistan&#x27;s two official languages, together with Pashto. The term &quot;Dari&quot;, meaning &quot;of the court&quot;, originally referred to the variety of Persian used in the court of the Sasanian Empire in capital Ctesiphon, which was spread to the northeast of the empire and gradually replaced the former Iranian dialects of Parthia (Parthian).

Tajik Persian (, ), the standard Persian of Tajikistan, has been officially designated as &quot;Tajik&quot; (, ) since the time of the Soviet Union. It is the name given to the varieties of Persian spoken in Central Asia in general.

===ISO codes===
The international language-encoding standard ISO 639-1 uses the code codice_1 for the Persian language, as its coding system is mostly based on the native-language designations. The more detailed standard ISO 639-3 uses the code codice_2 for the dialects spoken across Iran and Afghanistan. This consists of the individual languages Dari (codice_3) and Iranian Persian (codice_4). It uses codice_5 for Tajik, separately.

==History==
In general, the Iranian languages are known from three periods: namely Old, Middle, and New (Modern). These correspond to three historical eras of Iranian history; Old era being sometime around the Achaemenid Empire (i.e., 400–300 BC), Middle era being the next period most officially around the Sasanian Empire, and New era being the period afterward down to present day.

According to available documents, the Persian language is &quot;the only Iranian language&quot; for which close philological relationships between all of its three stages are established and so that Old, Middle, and New Persian represent one and the same language of Persian; that is, New Persian is a direct descendant of Middle and Old Persian. Gernot Windfuhr considers new Persian as an evolution of the Old Persian language and the Middle Persian language but also states that none of the known Middle Persian dialects is the direct predecessor of Modern Persian. Ludwig Paul states: &quot;The language of the Shahnameh should be seen as one instance of continuous historical development from Middle to New Persian.&quot;

The known history of the Persian language can be divided into the following three distinct periods:

===Old Persian===
As a written language, Old Persian is attested in royal Achaemenid inscriptions. The oldest known text written in Old Persian is from the Behistun Inscription, dating to the time of King Darius I (reigned 522–486 BC). Examples of Old Persian have been found in what is now Iran, Romania (Gherla), Armenia, Bahrain, Iraq, Turkey, and Egypt. Old Persian is one of the earliest attested Indo-European languages.

According to certain historical assumptions about the early history and origin of ancient Persians in Southwestern Iran (where Achaemenids hailed from), Old Persian was originally spoken by a tribe called &quot;Parsuwash&quot;, who arrived in the Iranian Plateau early in the 1st millennium BCE and finally migrated down into the area of present-day Fārs province. Their language, Old Persian, became the official language of the Achaemenid kings. Assyrian records, which in fact appear to provide the earliest evidence for ancient Iranian (Persian and Median) presence on the Iranian Plateau, give a good chronology but only an approximate geographical indication of what seem to be ancient Persians. In these records of the 9th century BCE, &quot;Parsuwash&quot; (along with &quot;Matai&quot;, presumably Medians) are first mentioned in the area of Lake Urmia in the records of Shalmaneser III. The exact identity of the Parsuwash is not known for certain, but from a linguistic viewpoint the word matches Old Persian itself coming directly from the older word . Also, as Old Persian contains many words from another extinct Iranian language, Median, according to P. O. Skjærvø it is probable that Old Persian had already been spoken before the formation of the Achaemenid Empire and was spoken during most of the first half of the first millennium BCE. Xenophon, a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions, describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BCE, which is when Old Persian was still spoken and extensively used. He relates that the Armenian people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the Persians.

Related to Old Persian, but from a different branch of the Iranian language family, was Avestan, the language of the Zoroastrian liturgical texts.

===Middle Persian===

The complex grammatical conjugation and declension of Old Persian yielded to the structure of Middle Persian in which the dual number disappeared, leaving only singular and plural, as did gender. Middle Persian developed the ezāfe construction, expressed through &quot;ī&quot; (modern &quot;e/ye&quot;), to indicate some of the relations between words that have been lost with the simplification of the earlier grammatical system.

Although the &quot;middle period&quot; of the Iranian languages formally begins with the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, the transition from Old to Middle Persian had probably already begun before the 4th century BC. However, Middle Persian is not actually attested until 600 years later when it appears in the Sassanid era (224–651 AD) inscriptions, so any form of the language before this date cannot be described with any degree of certainty. Moreover, as a literary language, Middle Persian is not attested until much later, in the 6th or 7th century. From the 8th century onward, Middle Persian gradually began yielding to New Persian, with the middle-period form only continuing in the texts of Zoroastrianism.

Middle Persian is considered to be a later form of the same dialect as Old Persian. The native name of Middle Persian was &quot;Parsig&quot; or &quot;Parsik&quot;, after the name of the ethnic group of the southwest, that is, &quot;of &quot;Pars&quot;&quot;, Old Persian &quot;Parsa&quot;, New Persian &quot;Fars&quot;. This is the origin of the name &quot;Farsi&quot; as it is today used to signify New Persian. Following the collapse of the Sassanid state, &quot;Parsik&quot; came to be applied exclusively to (either Middle or New) Persian that was written in the Arabic script. From about the 9th century onward, as Middle Persian was on the threshold of becoming New Persian, the older form of the language came to be erroneously called &quot;Pahlavi&quot;, which was actually but one of the &quot;writing systems&quot; used to render both Middle Persian as well as various other Middle Iranian languages. That writing system had previously been adopted by the Sassanids (who were Persians, i.e. from the southwest) from the preceding Arsacids (who were Parthians, i.e. from the northeast). While Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27; (eighth century) still distinguished between &quot;Pahlavi&quot; (i.e. Parthian) and &quot;Persian&quot; (in Arabic text: al-Farisiyah) (i.e. Middle Persian), this distinction is not evident in Arab commentaries written after that date.

===New Persian===

&quot;New Persian&quot; (also referred to as Modern Persian) is conventionally divided into three stages:
*Early New Persian (8th/9th centuries)
*Classical Persian (10th–18th centuries)
*Contemporary Persian (19th century to present)

Early New Persian remains largely intelligible to speakers of Contemporary Persian, as the morphology and, to a lesser extent, the lexicon of the language have remained relatively stable.

====Early New Persian====
New Persian texts written in the Arabic script first appear in the 9th-century. The language is a direct descendant of Middle Persian, the official, religious, and literary language of the Sasanian Empire (224–651). However, it is not descended from the literary form of Middle Persian (known as &quot;pārsīk&quot;, commonly called Pahlavi), which was spoken by the people of Fars and used in Zoroastrian religious writings. Instead, it is descended from the dialect spoken by the court of the Sasanian capital Ctesiphon and the northeastern Iranian region of Khorasan, known as Dari. The region, which comprised the present territories of northwestern Afghanistan as well as parts of Central Asia, played a leading role in the rise of New Persian. Khorasan, which was the homeland of the Parthians, was Persianized under the Sasanians. Dari Persian thus supplanted Parthian language, which by the end of the Sasanian era had fallen out of use. New Persian has incorporated many foreign words, including from eastern northern and northern Iranian languages such as Sogdian and especially Parthian.
The transition to New Persian was already complete by the era of the three princely dynasties of Iranian origin, the Tahirid dynasty (820–872), Saffarid dynasty (860–903), and Samanid Empire (874–999). Abbas of Merv is mentioned as being the earliest minstrel to chant verse in the New Persian tongue and after him the poems of Hanzala Badghisi were among the most famous between the Persian-speakers of the time.

The first poems of the Persian language, a language historically called Dari, emerged in present-day Afghanistan. The first significant Persian poet was Rudaki. He flourished in the 10th century, when the Samanids were at the height of their power. His reputation as a court poet and as an accomplished musician and singer has survived, although little of his poetry has been preserved. Among his lost works are versified fables collected in the &quot;Kalila wa Dimna&quot;.

The language spread geographically from the 11th century on and was the medium through which, among others, Central Asian Turks became familiar with Islam and urban culture. New Persian was widely used as a trans-regional lingua franca, a task aided due to its relatively simple morphology, and this situation persisted until at least the 19th century. In the late Middle Ages, new Islamic literary languages were created on the Persian model: Ottoman Turkish, Chagatai Turkic, Dobhashi Bengali, and Urdu, which are regarded as &quot;structural daughter languages&quot; of Persian.

====Classical Persian====
&quot;Classical Persian&quot; loosely refers to the standardized language of medieval Persia used in literature and poetry.
This is the language of the 10th to 12th centuries, which continued to be used as literary language and lingua franca under the &quot;Persianized&quot; Turko-Mongol dynasties during the 12th to 15th centuries, and under restored Persian rule during the 16th to 19th centuries.

Persian during this time served as lingua franca of Greater Persia and of much of the Indian subcontinent.
It was also the official and cultural language of many Islamic dynasties, including the Samanids, Buyids, Tahirids, Ziyarids, the Mughal Empire, Timurids, Ghaznavids, Karakhanids, Seljuqs, Khwarazmians, the Sultanate of Rum, Turkmen beyliks of Anatolia, Delhi Sultanate, the Shirvanshahs, Safavids, Afsharids, Zands, Qajars, Khanate of Bukhara, Khanate of Kokand, Emirate of Bukhara, Khanate of Khiva, Ottomans, and also many Mughal successors such as the Nizam of Hyderabad.
Persian was the only non-European language known and used by Marco Polo at the Court of Kublai Khan and in his journeys through China.

===== Use in Asia Minor =====

A branch of the Seljuks, the Sultanate of Rum, took Persian language, art, and letters to Anatolia. They adopted the Persian language as the official language of the empire. The Ottomans, who can roughly be seen as their eventual successors, inherited this tradition. Persian was the official court language of the empire, and for some time, the official language of the empire. The educated and noble class of the Ottoman Empire all spoke Persian, such as Sultan Selim I, despite being Safavid Iran&#x27;s archrival and a staunch opposer of Shia Islam. It was a major literary language in the empire. Some of the noted earlier Persian works during the Ottoman rule are Idris Bidlisi&#x27;s &quot;Hasht Bihisht&quot;, which began in 1502 and covered the reign of the first eight Ottoman rulers, and the &quot;Salim-Namah&quot;, a glorification of Selim I. After a period of several centuries, Ottoman Turkish (which was highly Persianised itself) had developed toward a fully accepted language of literature, and which was even able to lexically satisfy the demands of a scientific presentation. However, the number of Persian and Arabic loanwords contained in those works increased at times up to 88%. In the Ottoman Empire, Persian was used at the royal court, for diplomacy, poetry, historiographical works, literary works, and was taught in state schools, and was also offered as an elective course or recommended for study in some &quot;madrasas&quot;.

===== Use in the Balkans =====
Persian learning was also widespread in the Ottoman-held Balkans (&quot;Rumelia&quot;), with a range of cities being famed for their long-standing traditions in the study of Persian and its classics, amongst them Saraybosna (modern Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina), Mostar (also in Bosnia and Herzegovina), and Vardar Yenicesi (or Yenice-i Vardar, now Giannitsa, in the northern part of Greece).

Vardar Yenicesi differed from other localities in the Balkans insofar as that it was a town where Persian was also widely spoken. However, the Persian of Vardar Yenicesi and throughout the rest of the Ottoman-held Balkans was different from formal Persian both in accent and vocabulary. The difference was apparent to such a degree that the Ottomans referred to it as &quot;Rumelian Persian&quot; (&quot;Rumili Farsisi&quot;). As learned people such as students, scholars and literati often frequented Vardar Yenicesi, it soon became the site of a flourishing Persianate linguistic and literary culture. The 16th-century Ottoman Aşık Çelebi (died 1572), who hailed from Prizren in modern-day Kosovo, was galvanized by the abundant Persian-speaking and Persian-writing communities of Vardar Yenicesi, and he referred to the city as a &quot;hotbed of Persian&quot;.

Many Ottoman Persianists who established a career in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) pursued early Persian training in Saraybosna, amongst them Ahmed Sudi.

===== Use in Indian subcontinent =====

The Persian language influenced the formation of many modern languages in West Asia, Europe, Central Asia, and South Asia. Following the Turko-Persian Ghaznavid conquest of South Asia, Persian was firstly introduced in the region by Turkic Central Asians. The basis in general for the introduction of Persian language into the subcontinent was set, from its earliest days, by various Persianized Central Asian Turkic and Afghan dynasties. For five centuries prior to the British colonization, Persian was widely used as a second language in the Indian subcontinent. It took prominence as the language of culture and education in several Muslim courts on the subcontinent and became the sole &quot;official language&quot; under the Mughal emperors.

The Bengal Sultanate witnessed an influx of Persian scholars, lawyers, teachers, and clerics. Thousands of Persian books and manuscripts were published in Bengal. The period of the reign of Sultan Ghiyathuddin Azam Shah is described as the &quot;golden age of Persian literature in Bengal&quot;. Its stature was illustrated by the Sultan&#x27;s own correspondence and collaboration with the Persian poet Hafez; a poem which can be found in the &quot;Divan of Hafez&quot; today. A Bengali dialect emerged among the common Bengali Muslim folk, based on a Persian model and known as Dobhashi; meaning &quot;mixed language&quot;. Dobhashi Bengali was patronised and given official status under the Sultans of Bengal, and was a popular literary form used by Bengalis during the pre-colonial period, irrespective of their religion.

Following the defeat of the Hindu Shahi dynasty, classical Persian was established as a courtly language in the region during the late 10th century under Ghaznavid rule over the northwestern frontier of the subcontinent. Employed by Punjabis in literature, Persian achieved prominence in the region during the following centuries. Persian continued to act as a courtly language for various empires in Punjab through the early 19th century serving finally as the official state language of the Sikh Empire, preceding British conquest and the decline of Persian in South Asia.

Beginning in 1843, though, English and Hindustani gradually replaced Persian in importance on the subcontinent. Evidence of Persian&#x27;s historical influence there can be seen in the extent of its influence on certain languages of the Indian subcontinent. Words borrowed from Persian are still quite commonly used in certain Indo-Aryan languages, especially Hindi-Urdu (also historically known as Hindustani), Punjabi, Kashmiri, and Sindhi. There is also a small population of Zoroastrian Iranis in India, who migrated in the 19th century to escape religious execution in Qajar Iran and speak a Dari dialect.

====Contemporary Persian====

===== Qajar dynasty =====

In the 19th century, under the Qajar dynasty, the dialect that is spoken in Tehran rose to prominence. There was still substantial Arabic vocabulary, but many of these words have been integrated into Persian phonology and grammar. In addition, under the Qajar rule, numerous Russian, French, and English terms entered the Persian language, especially vocabulary related to technology.

The first official attentions to the necessity of protecting the Persian language against foreign words, and to the standardization of Persian orthography, were under the reign of Naser ed Din Shah of the Qajar dynasty in 1871. After Naser ed Din Shah, Mozaffar ed Din Shah ordered the establishment of the first Persian association in 1903. This association officially declared that it used Persian and Arabic as acceptable sources for coining words. The ultimate goal was to prevent books from being printed with wrong use of words. According to the executive guarantee of this association, the government was responsible for wrongfully printed books. Words coined by this association, such as &quot;rāh-āhan&quot; () for &quot;railway&quot;, were printed in &quot;Soltani Newspaper&quot;; but the association was eventually closed due to inattention.

A scientific association was founded in 1911, resulting in a dictionary called &quot;Words of Scientific Association&quot; (), which was completed in the future and renamed &quot;Katouzian Dictionary&quot; ().

===== Pahlavi dynasty =====
The first academy for the Persian language was founded on 20 May 1935, under the name &quot;Academy of Iran&quot;. It was established by the initiative of Reza Shah Pahlavi, and mainly by Hekmat e Shirazi and Mohammad Ali Foroughi, all prominent names in the nationalist movement of the time.
The academy was a key institution in the struggle to re-build Iran as a nation-state after the collapse of the Qajar dynasty. During the 1930s and 1940s, the academy led massive campaigns to replace the many Arabic, Russian, French, and Greek loanwords whose widespread use in Persian during the centuries preceding the foundation of the Pahlavi dynasty had created a literary language considerably different from the spoken Persian of the time. This became the basis of what is now known as &quot;Contemporary Standard Persian&quot;.

==Varieties==
There are three standard varieties of modern Persian:
*&quot;Iranian Persian&quot; (&quot;Persian&quot;, &quot;Western Persian&quot;, or &quot;Farsi&quot;) is spoken in Iran, and by minorities in Iraq and the Persian Gulf states.
*&quot;Eastern Persian&quot; (&quot;Dari Persian&quot;, &quot;Afghan Persian&quot;, or &quot;Dari&quot;) is spoken in Afghanistan.
*&quot;Tajiki&quot; (&quot;Tajik Persian&quot;) is spoken in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. It is written in the Cyrillic script.

All these three varieties are based on the classic Persian literature and its literary tradition. There are also several local dialects from Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan which slightly differ from the standard Persian. The Hazaragi dialect (in Central Afghanistan and Pakistan), Herati (in Western Afghanistan), Darwazi (in Afghanistan and Tajikistan), Basseri (in Southern Iran), and the Tehrani accent (in Iran, the basis of standard Iranian Persian) are examples of these dialects. Persian-speaking peoples of Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan can understand one another with a relatively high degree of mutual intelligibility. Nevertheless, the &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot; notes that the Iranian, Afghan, and Tajiki varieties comprise distinct branches of the Persian language, and within each branch a wide variety of local dialects exist.

The following are some languages closely related to Persian, or in some cases are considered dialects:
*Luri (or &quot;Lori&quot;), spoken mainly in the southwestern Iranian provinces of Lorestan, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari some western parts of Fars province, and some parts of Khuzestan province.
*Achomi (or &quot;Lari&quot;), spoken mainly in southern Iranian provinces of Fars and Hormozgan, unlike New Persian and its variants like Dari, Standard Persian, and Iranian Persian, this is a branch of Middle Persian.
*Tat, spoken in parts of Azerbaijan, Russia, and Transcaucasia. It is classified as a variety of Persian. (This dialect is not to be confused with the Tati language of northwestern Iran, which is a member of a different branch of the Iranian languages.)
*Judeo-Tat. Part of the Tat-Persian continuum, spoken in Azerbaijan, Russia, as well as by immigrant communities in Israel and New York.

More distantly related branches of the Iranian language family include Kurdish and Balochi.

The Glottolog database proposes the following phylogenetic classification:

* Farsic–Caucasian Tat
** Caucasian Tat
*** Judeo-Tat
*** Muslim Tat (including Armeno-Tat)
** Farsic
*** Eastern Farsic
**** Aimaq
**** Dari
**** Dehwari
**** Hazaragi
**** Pahlavani
**** Tajikic
***** Bukharic
***** Tajik
*** Judeo-Persian
*** Western Farsi
==Phonology==

Iranian Persian and Tajik have six vowels; Dari has 8. Iranian Persian has twenty-three consonants, but both Dari and Tajiki have twenty-four consonants. (due to the phonemic merger of and in Iranian Persian).

===Vowels===
Historically, Persian distinguished length. Early New Persian had a series of five long vowels (, , , , and ) along with three short vowels , , and . At some point prior to the 16th century in the general area now modern Iran, and merged into , and and merged into . Thus, older contrasts such as &quot;shēr&quot; &quot;lion&quot; vs. &quot;shīr&quot; &quot;milk&quot;, and &quot;zūd&quot; &quot;quick&quot; vs &quot;zōr&quot; &quot;strength&quot; were lost. However, there are exceptions to this rule, and in some words, &quot;ē&quot; and &quot;ō&quot; are merged into the diphthongs and (which are descendants of the diphthongs and in Early New Persian), instead of merging into and . Examples of the exception can be found in words such as (bright). Numerous other instances exist.

However, in Dari, the archaic distinction of and (respectively known as &quot;Yā-ye majhūl&quot; and &quot;Yā-ye ma&#x27;rūf&quot;) is still preserved as well as the distinction of and (known as &quot;Wāw-e majhūl&quot; and &quot;Wāw-e ma&#x27;rūf&quot;). On the other hand, in standard Tajik, the length distinction has disappeared, and merged with and with . Therefore, contemporary Afghan Dari dialects are the closest to the vowel inventory of Early New Persian.

According to most studies on the subject (e.g. , , ), the three vowels traditionally considered long (, , ) are currently distinguished from their short counterparts (, , ) by position of articulation rather than by length. However, there are studies (e.g. , ) that consider vowel length to be the active feature of the system, with , , and phonologically long or bimoraic and , , and phonologically short or monomoraic.

There are also some studies that consider quality and quantity to be both active in the Iranian system (such as Toosarvandani 2004). That offers a synthetic analysis including both quality and quantity, which often suggests that Modern Persian vowels are in a transition state between the quantitative system of Classical Persian and a hypothetical future Iranian language, which will eliminate all traces of quantity and retain quality as the only active feature.

The length distinction is still strictly observed by careful reciters of classic-style poetry for all varieties (including Tajik).

===Consonants===

Notes:

* in Iranian Persian and have merged into , as a voiced velar fricative when positioned intervocalically and unstressed, and as a voiced uvular stop otherwise.
* is realized as before velar consonants.

==Grammar==
===Morphology===
Suffixes predominate Persian morphology, though there are a small number of prefixes. Verbs can express tense and aspect, and they agree with the subject in person and number. There is no grammatical gender in modern Persian, and pronouns are not marked for natural gender. In other words, in Persian, pronouns are gender-neutral. When referring to a masculine or a feminine subject, the same pronoun is used (pronounced &quot;ou&quot;, ū).

===Syntax===
Persian adheres mainly to subject–object–verb (SOV) word order. But case endings (e.g. for subject, object, etc.) expressed via suffixes may allow users to vary word order. Verbs agree with the subject in person and number. Normal declarative sentences are structured as &quot;(S) (PP) (O) V&quot;: sentences have optional subjects, prepositional phrases, and objects followed by a compulsory verb. If the object is specific, the object is followed by the word &quot;rā&quot; and precedes prepositional phrases: &quot;(S) (O + &quot;rā&quot;) (PP) V&quot;.

==Vocabulary==
===Native word formation===
Persian makes extensive use of word building and combining affixes, stems, nouns, and adjectives. Persian frequently uses derivational agglutination to form new words from nouns, adjectives, and verbal stems. New words are extensively formed by compounding – two existing words combining into a new one.

===Influences===
While having a lesser influence from Arabic and other languages of Mesopotamia and its core vocabulary being of Middle Persian origin, New Persian contains a considerable number of Arabic lexical items, which were Persianized and often took a different meaning and usage than the Arabic original. Persian loanwords of Arabic origin especially include Islamic terms. The Arabic vocabulary in other Iranian, Turkic, and Indic languages is generally understood to have been copied from New Persian, not from Arabic itself.

John R. Perry, in his article &quot;Lexical Areas and Semantic Fields of Arabic&quot;, estimates that about 20 percent of everyday vocabulary in current Persian, and around 25 percent of the vocabulary of classical and modern Persian literature, are of Arabic origin. The text frequency of these loan words is generally lower and varies by style and topic area. It may approach 25 percent of a text in literature. According to another source, about 40% of everyday Persian literary vocabulary is of Arabic origin. Among the Arabic loan words, relatively few (14 percent) are from the semantic domain of material culture, while a larger number are from domains of intellectual and spiritual life. Most of the Arabic words used in Persian are either synonyms of native terms or could be glossed in Persian.

The inclusion of Mongolic and Turkic elements in the Persian language should also be mentioned, not only because of the political role a succession of Turkic dynasties played in Iranian history, but also because of the immense prestige Persian language and literature enjoyed in the wider (non-Arab) Islamic world, which was often ruled by sultans and emirs with a Turkic background. The Turkish and Mongolian vocabulary in Persian is minor in comparison to that of Arabic and these words were mainly confined to military, pastoral terms and political sector (titles, administration, etc.). New military and political titles were coined based partially on Middle Persian (e.g. for &quot;army&quot;, instead of the Uzbek ; ; ; etc.) in the 20th century. Persian has likewise influenced the vocabularies of other languages, especially other Indo-European languages such as Armenian, Urdu, Bengali, and Hindi; the latter three through conquests of Persianized Central Asian Turkic and Afghan invaders; Turkic languages such as Ottoman Turkish, Chagatai, Tatar, Turkish, Turkmen, Azeri, Uzbek, and Karachay-Balkar; Caucasian languages such as Georgian, and, to a lesser extent, Avar and Lezgin; Afro-Asiatic languages like Assyrian (List of loanwords in Assyrian Neo-Aramaic) and Arabic, particularly Bahrani Arabic; and even Dravidian languages indirectly especially Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, and Brahui; as well as Austronesian languages such as Indonesian and Malaysian Malay. Persian has also had a significant lexical influence, via Turkish, on Albanian and Serbo-Croatian, particularly as spoken in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Use of occasional foreign synonyms instead of Persian words can be a common practice in everyday communications as an alternative expression. In some instances in addition to the Persian vocabulary, the equivalent synonyms from multiple foreign languages can be used. For example, in Iranian colloquial Persian (not in Afghanistan or Tajikistan), the phrase &quot;thank you&quot; may be expressed using the French word (stressed, however, on the first syllable), the hybrid Persian-Arabic phrase ( being &quot;thankful&quot; in Arabic, commonly pronounced in Persian, and the verb &quot;am&quot; meaning &quot;I am&quot; in Persian), or by the pure Persian phrase .

==Orthography==


The vast majority of modern Iranian Persian and Dari text is written with the Arabic script. Tajiki, which is considered by some linguists to be a Persian dialect influenced by Russian and the Turkic languages of Central Asia, is written with the Cyrillic script in Tajikistan (see Tajik alphabet). There also exist several romanization systems for Persian.

===Persian alphabet===
Modern Iranian Persian and Afghan Persian are written using the Persian alphabet which is a modified variant of the Arabic alphabet, which uses different pronunciation and additional letters not found in Arabic language. After the Arab conquest of Persia, it took approximately 200 years before Persians adopted the Arabic script in place of the older alphabet. Previously, two different scripts were used, Pahlavi, used for Middle Persian, and the Avestan alphabet (in Persian, Dīndapirak, or Din Dabire—literally: religion script), used for religious purposes, primarily for the Avestan but sometimes for Middle Persian.

In the modern Persian script, historically short vowels are usually not written, only the historically long ones are represented in the text, so words distinguished from each other only by short vowels are ambiguous in writing: Iranian Persian &#x27; &quot;worm&quot;, &#x27; &quot;generosity&quot;, &#x27; &quot;cream&quot;, and &#x27; &quot;chrome&quot; are all spelled &quot;&quot; () in Persian. The reader must determine the word from context. The Arabic system of vocalization marks known as &quot;harakat&quot; is also used in Persian, although some of the symbols have different pronunciations. For example, a &quot;ḍammah&quot; is pronounced , while in Iranian Persian it is pronounced . This system is not used in mainstream Persian literature; it is primarily used for teaching and in some (but not all) dictionaries.
There are several letters generally only used in Arabic loanwords. These letters are pronounced the same as similar Persian letters. For example, there are four functionally identical letters for (), three letters for (), two letters for (), two letters for ().
On the other hand, there are four letters that do not exist in Arabic .

The Persian alphabet adds four letters to the Arabic alphabet:

Historically, there was also a special letter for the sound . This letter is no longer used, as the -sound changed to , e.g. archaic &gt; &#x27;language&#x27;

====Variations====
The Persian alphabet also modifies some letters of the Arabic alphabet. For example, &quot;alef with hamza below&quot; ( ) changes to &quot;alef&quot; ( ); words using various hamzas get spelled with yet another kind of hamza (so that becomes ) even though the latter has been accepted in Arabic since the 1980s; and &quot;teh marbuta&quot; ( ) changes to &quot;heh&quot; ( ) or &quot;teh&quot; ( ).

The letters different in shape are:

However, in shape and form is the traditional Arabic style that continues in the Nile Valley, namely, Egypt, Sudan, and South Sudan.

===Latin alphabet===
The International Organization for Standardization has published a standard for simplified transliteration of Persian into Latin, ISO 233-3, titled &quot;Information and documentation – Transliteration of Arabic characters into Latin characters – Part 3: Persian language – Simplified transliteration&quot; but the transliteration scheme is not in widespread use.

Another Latin alphabet, based on the New Turkic Alphabet, was used in Tajikistan in the 1920s and 1930s. The alphabet was phased out in favor of Cyrillic in the late 1930s.

Fingilish is Persian using ISO basic Latin alphabet. It is most commonly used in chat, emails, and SMS applications. The orthography is not standardized, and varies among writers and even media (for example, typing &#x27;aa&#x27; for the phoneme is easier on computer keyboards than on cellphone keyboards, resulting in smaller usage of the combination on cellphones).

===Tajik alphabet===
The Cyrillic script was introduced for writing the Tajik language under the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic in the late 1930s, replacing the Latin alphabet that had been used since the October Revolution and the Persian script that had been used earlier. After 1939, materials published in Persian in the Persian script were banned in the country.

<text>Frances Abington (; 1737 – 4 March 1815) was an English actress who was also known for her sense of fashion. Writer and politician Horace Walpole described her as one of the finest actors of their time, and Richard Brinsley Sheridan was said to have written the part of Lady Teazle in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; for her to perform.

==Early life==
She was born Frances Barton (nicknamed &quot;Fanny&quot;), as the daughter of a private soldier. She began her career as a flower girl and a street singer. It was also rumoured that she recited Shakespeare in taverns at the age of 12, along with being a prostitute for a short period to help her family with financial problems. Later, she became a servant to a French milliner. During that time, she learnt about costume and learnt French. Her early nickname, Nosegay Fan, came from her time as a flower girl.

== Career ==
Her first appearance on stage was at Haymarket in 1755 as Miranda in Mrs Centlivre&#x27;s play, &quot;Busybody&quot;. She rose to become a principal actor in October 1756 when she was cast as Lady Pliant in &quot;The Double Dealer&quot;at the Drury Lane. The play&#x27;s cast also included the stars Hannah Pritchard and Kitty Clive. She also appeared in Ireland, where her Lady Townley (in &quot;The Provoked Husband&quot; by Vanbrugh and Cibber) was a success. David Garrick convinced her to return to Drury Lane, and they worked together there until his retirement in 1776.

From 1759 onwards she appeared in the bills as &quot;Mrs Abington&quot;, following her marriage to her music tutor, the royal trumpeter James Abington. They separated shortly after their marriage as he could not cope with her popularity. They lived separately, with Fanny paying James a small annual stipend to stay away from her. She subsequently had affairs with an Irish MP, Needham, who left her a considerable estate, and William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne. The income from her estate and her stage work made her a wealthy woman.

She remained at the Drury Lane for 18 years, being the first to play more than 30 important characters, notably Lady Teazle (1777) in The School for Scandal.

In April 1772, when James Northcote saw her as Miss Notable in Cibber&#x27;s &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Last Stake&quot;, he remarked to his brother 

Her wealth and popularity meant she influenced fashion. The press reported on her hair styles: her low hair in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; was praised for changing the fashion. Her performance as Kitty in &quot;High Life Below Stairs&quot; put her in the foremost rank of comic actresses and made the mob cap she wore in the role fashionable. It was soon being referred to as the &quot;Abington Cap&quot; on stage and at hatters&#x27; shops across Ireland and England. 

It was as the last character in Congreve&#x27;s &quot;Love for Love&quot; that Sir Joshua Reynolds painted the best-known of his half-dozen or more portraits of her (&quot;illustration, left&quot;). In 1782 she left Drury Lane for Covent Garden. After an absence from the stage from 1790 until 1797, she reappeared, quitting finally in 1799.

==Death==
Frances Abington died on 4 March 1815 at her home on Pall Mall, London. She was buried at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly.

<text>In mathematics, a finite field or Galois field (so-named in honor of Évariste Galois) is a field that contains a finite number of elements. As with any field, a finite field is a set on which the operations of multiplication, addition, subtraction and division are defined and satisfy certain basic rules. The most common examples of finite fields are the integers mod formula_1 when formula_1 is a prime number.

The &quot;order&quot; of a finite field is its number of elements, which is either a prime number or a prime power. For every prime number formula_1 and every positive integer formula_4 there are fields of order formula_5. All finite fields of a given order are isomorphic.

Finite fields are fundamental in a number of areas of mathematics and computer science, including number theory, algebraic geometry, Galois theory, finite geometry, cryptography and coding theory.

== Properties ==

A finite field is a finite set that is a field; this means that multiplication, addition, subtraction and division (excluding division by zero) are defined and satisfy the rules of arithmetic known as the field axioms.

The number of elements of a finite field is called its &quot;order&quot; or, sometimes, its &quot;size&quot;. A finite field of order formula_6 exists if and only if formula_6 is a prime power formula_5 (where formula_1 is a prime number and formula_4 is a positive integer). In a field of order formula_5, adding formula_1 copies of any element always results in zero; that is, the characteristic of the field is formula_1.

For formula_14, all fields of order formula_6 are isomorphic (see &quot;&quot; below). Moreover, a field cannot contain two different finite subfields with the same order. One may therefore identify all finite fields with the same order, and they are unambiguously denoted formula_16, formula_17 or formula_18, where the letters GF stand for &quot;Galois field&quot;.

In a finite field of order formula_6, the polynomial formula_20 has all formula_6 elements of the finite field as roots. The non-zero elements of a finite field form a multiplicative group. This group is cyclic, so all non-zero elements can be expressed as powers of a single element called a primitive element of the field. (In general there will be several primitive elements for a given field.)

The simplest examples of finite fields are the fields of prime order: for each prime number formula_1, the prime field of order formula_1 may be constructed as the integers modulo formula_1, formula_25.

The elements of the prime field of order formula_1 may be represented by integers in the range formula_27. The sum, the difference and the product are the remainder of the division by formula_1 of the result of the corresponding integer operation. The multiplicative inverse of an element may be computed by using the extended Euclidean algorithm (see &quot;&quot;).

Let formula_29 be a finite field. For any element formula_30 in formula_29 and any integer formula_32, denote by formula_33 the sum of formula_32 copies of formula_30. The least positive formula_32 such that formula_37 is the characteristic formula_1 of the field. This allows defining a multiplication formula_39 of an element formula_4 of formula_41 by an element formula_30 of formula_29 by choosing an integer representative for formula_4. This multiplication makes formula_29 into a formula_41-vector space. It follows that the number of elements of formula_29 is formula_48 for some integer formula_32.

The identity
formula_50
(sometimes called the freshman&#x27;s dream) is true in a field of characteristic formula_1. This follows from the binomial theorem, as each binomial coefficient of the expansion of formula_52, except the first and the last, is a multiple of formula_1.

By Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, if formula_1 is a prime number and formula_30 is in the field formula_41 then formula_57. This implies the equality
formula_58
for polynomials over formula_41. More generally, every element in formula_60 satisfies the polynomial equation formula_61.

Any finite field extension of a finite field is separable and simple. That is, if formula_62 is a finite field and formula_29 is a subfield of formula_62, then formula_62 is obtained from formula_29 by adjoining a single element whose minimal polynomial is separable. To use a piece of jargon, finite fields are perfect.

A more general algebraic structure that satisfies all the other axioms of a field, but whose multiplication is not required to be commutative, is called a division ring (or sometimes &quot;skew field&quot;). By Wedderburn&#x27;s little theorem, any finite division ring is commutative, and hence is a finite field.

== Existence and uniqueness ==
Let formula_67 be a prime power, and formula_29 be the splitting field of the polynomial 
formula_69
over the prime field formula_41. This means that formula_29 is a finite field of lowest order, in which formula_72 has formula_6 distinct roots (the formal derivative of formula_72 is formula_75, implying that formula_76, which in general implies that the splitting field is a separable extension of the original). The above identity shows that the sum and the product of two roots of formula_72 are roots of formula_72, as well as the multiplicative inverse of a root of formula_72. In other words, the roots of formula_72 form a field of order formula_6, which is equal to formula_29 by the minimality of the splitting field.

The uniqueness up to isomorphism of splitting fields implies thus that all fields of order formula_6 are isomorphic. Also, if a field formula_29 has a field of order formula_14 as a subfield, its elements are the formula_6 roots of formula_20, and formula_29 cannot contain another subfield of order formula_6.

In summary, we have the following classification theorem first proved in 1893 by E. H. Moore:

&quot;The order of a finite field is a prime power. For every prime power&quot; formula_6 &quot;there are fields of order&quot; formula_6, &quot;and they are all isomorphic. In these fields, every element satisfies&quot;
formula_92
&quot;and the polynomial&quot; formula_20 &quot;factors as&quot; 
formula_94

It follows that formula_60 contains a subfield isomorphic to formula_96 if and only if formula_97 is a divisor of formula_32; in that case, this subfield is unique. In fact, the polynomial formula_99 divides formula_100 if and only if formula_97 is a divisor of formula_32.

== Explicit construction ==

=== Non-prime fields ===
Given a prime power formula_67 with formula_1 prime and formula_105, the field formula_18 may be explicitly constructed in the following way. One first chooses an irreducible polynomial formula_72 in formula_108 of degree formula_32 (such an irreducible polynomial always exists). Then the quotient ring 
formula_110
of the polynomial ring formula_108 by the ideal generated by formula_72 is a field of order formula_6.

More explicitly, the elements of formula_18 are the polynomials over formula_41 whose degree is strictly less than formula_32. The addition and the subtraction are those of polynomials over formula_41. The product of two elements is the remainder of the Euclidean division by formula_72 of the product in formula_119.
The multiplicative inverse of a non-zero element may be computed with the extended Euclidean algorithm; see &quot;&quot;.

However, with this representation, elements of formula_18 may be difficult to distinguish from the corresponding polynomials. Therefore, it is common to give a name, commonly formula_121 to the element of formula_18 that corresponds to the polynomial formula_123. So, the elements of formula_18 become polynomials in formula_121, where formula_126, and, when one encounters a polynomial in formula_121 of degree greater or equal to formula_32 (for example after a multiplication), one knows that one has to use the relation formula_126 to reduce its degree (it is what Euclidean division is doing).

Except in the construction of formula_130, there are several possible choices for formula_72, which produce isomorphic results. To simplify the Euclidean division, one commonly chooses for formula_72 a polynomial of the form 
formula_133
which make the needed Euclidean divisions very efficient. However, for some fields, typically in characteristic formula_134, irreducible polynomials of the form formula_135 may not exist. In characteristic formula_134, if the polynomial formula_137 is reducible, it is recommended to choose formula_138 with the lowest possible formula_4 that makes the polynomial irreducible. If all these trinomials are reducible, one chooses &quot;pentanomials&quot; formula_140, as polynomials of degree greater than formula_141, with an even number of terms, are never irreducible in characteristic formula_134, having formula_141 as a root.

A possible choice for such a polynomial is given by Conway polynomials. They ensure a certain compatibility between the representation of a field and the representations of its subfields.

In the next sections, we will show how the general construction method outlined above works for small finite fields.

=== Field with four elements ===
The smallest non-prime field is the field with four elements, which is commonly denoted formula_130 or formula_145 It consists of the four elements formula_146 such that formula_147, formula_148, formula_149, and formula_150, for every formula_151, the other operation results being easily deduced from the distributive law. See below for the complete operation tables.

This may be deduced as follows from the results of the preceding section.

Over formula_152, there is only one irreducible polynomial of degree formula_134:
formula_154
Therefore, for formula_130 the construction of the preceding section must involve this polynomial, and
formula_156
Let formula_121 denote a root of this polynomial in formula_130. This implies that
formula_159
and that formula_121 and formula_161 are the elements of formula_130 that are not in formula_152. The tables of the operations in formula_130 result from this, and are as follows:

A table for subtraction is not given, because subtraction is identical to addition, as is the case for every field of characteristic 2.
In the third table, for the division of formula_30 by formula_166, the values of formula_30 must be read in the left column, and the values of formula_166 in the top row. (Because formula_169 for every formula_170 in every ring the division by 0 has to remain undefined.) From the tables, it can be seen that the additive structure of formula_130 is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, while the non-zero multiplicative structure is isomorphic to the group formula_172.

The map
formula_173
is the non-trivial field automorphism, called the Frobenius automorphism, which sends formula_121 into the second root formula_161 of the above-mentioned irreducible polynomial formula_176.

=== GF(&quot;p&quot;2) for an odd prime &quot;p&quot; ===
For applying the above general construction of finite fields in the case of formula_177, one has to find an irreducible polynomial of degree 2. For formula_178, this has been done in the preceding section. If formula_1 is an odd prime, there are always irreducible polynomials of the form formula_180, with formula_181 in formula_41.

More precisely, the polynomial formula_180 is irreducible over formula_41 if and only if formula_181 is a quadratic non-residue modulo formula_1 (this is almost the definition of a quadratic non-residue). There are formula_187 quadratic non-residues modulo formula_1. For example, formula_134 is a quadratic non-residue for formula_190, and formula_191 is a quadratic non-residue for formula_192. If formula_193, that is formula_194, one may choose formula_195 as a quadratic non-residue, which allows us to have a very simple irreducible polynomial formula_196.

Having chosen a quadratic non-residue formula_181, let formula_121 be a symbolic square root of formula_181, that is, a symbol that has the property formula_200, in the same way that the complex number formula_201 is a symbolic square root of formula_202. Then, the elements of formula_177 are all the linear expressions
formula_204
with formula_205 and formula_206 in formula_41. The operations on formula_177 are defined as follows (the operations between elements of formula_41 represented by Latin letters are the operations in formula_41):
formula_211

=== GF(8) and GF(27) ===
The polynomial
formula_212
is irreducible over formula_152 and formula_214, that is, it is irreducible modulo formula_134 and formula_191 (to show this, it suffices to show that it has no root in formula_152 nor in formula_214). It follows that the elements of formula_219 and formula_220 may be represented by expressions
formula_221
where formula_222 are elements of formula_152 or formula_214 (respectively), and formula_121 is a symbol such that 
formula_226

The addition, additive inverse and multiplication on formula_219 and formula_220 may thus be defined as follows; in following formulas, the operations between elements of formula_152 or formula_214, represented by Latin letters, are the operations in formula_152 or formula_214, respectively:
formula_233

=== GF(16) ===
The polynomial
formula_234
is irreducible over formula_152, that is, it is irreducible modulo formula_134. It follows that the elements of formula_237 may be represented by expressions
formula_238
where formula_239 are either formula_240 or formula_141 (elements of formula_152), and formula_121 is a symbol such that 
formula_244
(that is, formula_121 is defined as a root of the given irreducible polynomial). As the characteristic of formula_152 is formula_134, each element is its additive inverse in formula_237. The addition and multiplication on formula_237 may be defined as follows; in following formulas, the operations between elements of formula_152, represented by Latin letters are the operations in formula_152.
formula_252

The field formula_237 has eight primitive elements (the elements that have all nonzero elements of formula_237 as integer powers). These elements are the four roots of formula_255 and their multiplicative inverses. In particular, formula_121 is a primitive element, and the primitive elements are formula_257 with formula_97 less than and coprime with formula_259 (that is, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14).

== Multiplicative structure ==

The set of non-zero elements in formula_18 is an abelian group under the multiplication, of order formula_261. By Lagrange&#x27;s theorem, there exists a divisor formula_4 of formula_261 such that formula_264 for every non-zero formula_30 in formula_18. As the equation formula_264 has at most formula_4 solutions in any field, formula_261 is the lowest possible value for formula_4.
The structure theorem of finite abelian groups implies that this multiplicative group is cyclic, that is, all non-zero elements are powers of a single element. In summary:

Such an element formula_205 is called a primitive element of formula_18. Unless formula_273, the primitive element is not unique. The number of primitive elements is formula_274 where formula_275 is Euler&#x27;s totient function.

The result above implies that formula_276 for every formula_30 in formula_18. The particular case where formula_6 is prime is Fermat&#x27;s little theorem.

=== Discrete logarithm ===

If formula_205 is a primitive element in formula_18, then for any non-zero element formula_30 in formula_29, there is a unique integer formula_32 with formula_285 such that formula_286.
This integer formula_32 is called the discrete logarithm of formula_30 to the base formula_205.

While formula_290 can be computed very quickly, for example using exponentiation by squaring, there is no known efficient algorithm for computing the inverse operation, the discrete logarithm. This has been used in various cryptographic protocols, see &quot;Discrete logarithm&quot; for details.

When the nonzero elements of formula_18 are represented by their discrete logarithms, multiplication and division are easy, as they reduce to addition and subtraction modulo formula_261. However, addition amounts to computing the discrete logarithm of formula_293. The identity 
formula_294
allows one to solve this problem by constructing the table of the discrete logarithms of formula_295, called Zech&#x27;s logarithms, for formula_296 (it is convenient to define the discrete logarithm of zero as being formula_297).

Zech&#x27;s logarithms are useful for large computations, such as linear algebra over medium-sized fields, that is, fields that are sufficiently large for making natural algorithms inefficient, but not too large, as one has to pre-compute a table of the same size as the order of the field.

=== Roots of unity ===

Every nonzero element of a finite field is a root of unity, as formula_298 for every nonzero element of formula_18.

If formula_32 is a positive integer, an formula_32th primitive root of unity is a solution of the equation formula_302 that is not a solution of the equation formula_303 for any positive integer formula_304. If formula_205 is a formula_32th primitive root of unity in a field formula_29, then formula_29 contains all the formula_32 roots of unity, which are formula_310.

The field formula_18 contains a formula_32th primitive root of unity if and only if formula_32 is a divisor of formula_261; if formula_32 is a divisor of formula_261, then the number of primitive formula_32th roots of unity in formula_18 is formula_319 (Euler&#x27;s totient function). The number of formula_32th roots of unity in formula_18 is formula_322.

In a field of characteristic formula_1, every formula_324th root of unity is also a formula_32th root of unity. It follows that primitive formula_324th roots of unity never exist in a field of characteristic formula_1.

On the other hand, if formula_32 is coprime to formula_1, the roots of the formula_32th cyclotomic polynomial are distinct in every field of characteristic formula_1, as this polynomial is a divisor of formula_332, whose discriminant formula_333 is nonzero modulo formula_1. It follows that the formula_32th cyclotomic polynomial factors over formula_18 into distinct irreducible polynomials that have all the same degree, say formula_337, and that formula_338 is the smallest field of characteristic formula_1 that contains the formula_32th primitive roots of unity.

When computing Brauer characters, one uses the map formula_341 to map eigenvalues of a representation matrix to the complex numbers. Under this mapping, the base subfield formula_41 consists of evenly spaced points around the unit circle (omitting zero).

=== Example: GF(64) ===
The field formula_343 has several interesting properties that smaller fields do not share: it has two subfields such that neither is contained in the other; not all generators (elements with minimal polynomial of degree formula_344 over formula_152) are primitive elements; and the primitive elements are not all conjugate under the Galois group.

The order of this field being , and the divisors of being , the subfields of are , , , and itself. As and are coprime, the intersection of and in is the prime field .

The union of and has thus elements. The remaining elements of generate in the sense that no other subfield contains any of them. It follows that they are roots of irreducible polynomials of degree over . This implies that, over , there are exactly irreducible monic polynomials of degree . This may be verified by factoring over .

The elements of are primitive formula_32th roots of unity for some formula_32 dividing formula_348. As the 3rd and the 7th roots of unity belong to and , respectively, the generators are primitive th roots of unity for some in . Euler&#x27;s totient function shows that there are primitive th roots of unity, formula_349 primitive formula_350st roots of unity, and formula_351 primitive rd roots of unity. Summing these numbers, one finds again formula_352 elements.

By factoring the cyclotomic polynomials over formula_152, one finds that:
* The six primitive formula_354th roots of unity are roots of formula_355 and are all conjugate under the action of the Galois group.
* The twelve primitive formula_350st roots of unity are roots of formula_357 They form two orbits under the action of the Galois group. As the two factors are reciprocal to each other, a root and its (multiplicative) inverse do not belong to the same orbit.
* The formula_351 primitive elements of formula_343 are the roots of formula_360 They split into six orbits of six elements each under the action of the Galois group.

This shows that the best choice to construct formula_343 is to define it as . In fact, this generator is a primitive element, and this polynomial is the irreducible polynomial that produces the easiest Euclidean division.

== Frobenius automorphism and Galois theory ==

In this section, formula_1 is a prime number, and formula_67 is a power of formula_1.

In formula_18, the identity implies that the map
formula_366
is a formula_41-linear endomorphism and a field automorphism of formula_18, which fixes every element of the subfield formula_41. It is called the Frobenius automorphism, after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius.

Denoting by the composition of with itself times, we have 
formula_370
It has been shown in the preceding section that is the identity. For , the automorphism is not the identity, as, otherwise, the polynomial 
formula_371
would have more than roots.

There are no other -automorphisms of . In other words, has exactly -automorphisms, which are 
formula_372

In terms of Galois theory, this means that is a Galois extension of , which has a cyclic Galois group.

The fact that the Frobenius map is surjective implies that every finite field is perfect.

== Polynomial factorization ==

If is a finite field, a non-constant monic polynomial with coefficients in is irreducible over , if it is not the product of two non-constant monic polynomials, with coefficients in .

As every polynomial ring over a field is a unique factorization domain, every monic polynomial over a finite field may be factored in a unique way (up to the order of the factors) into a product of irreducible monic polynomials.

There are efficient algorithms for testing polynomial irreducibility and factoring polynomials over finite fields. They are a key step for factoring polynomials over the integers or the rational numbers. At least for this reason, every computer algebra system has functions for factoring polynomials over finite fields, or, at least, over finite prime fields.

=== Irreducible polynomials of a given degree ===
The polynomial
formula_373 
factors into linear factors over a field of order . More precisely, this polynomial is the product of all monic polynomials of degree one over a field of order .

This implies that, if then is the product of all monic irreducible polynomials over , whose degree divides . In fact, if is an irreducible factor over of , its degree divides , as its splitting field is contained in . Conversely, if is an irreducible monic polynomial over of degree dividing , it defines a field extension of degree , which is contained in , and all roots of belong to , and are roots of ; thus divides . As does not have any multiple factor, it is thus the product of all the irreducible monic polynomials that divide it.

This property is used to compute the product of the irreducible factors of each degree of polynomials over ; see &quot;Distinct degree factorization&quot;.

=== Number of monic irreducible polynomials of a given degree over a finite field ===
The number of monic irreducible polynomials of degree over 
 is given by
formula_374
where is the Möbius function. This formula is an immediate consequence of the property of above and the Möbius inversion formula.

By the above formula, the number of irreducible (not necessarily monic) polynomials of degree over is .

The exact formula implies the inequality
formula_375
this is sharp if and only if is a power of some prime.
For every and every , the right hand side is positive, so there is at least one irreducible polynomial of degree over .

== Applications ==
In cryptography, the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem in finite fields or in elliptic curves is the basis of several widely used protocols, such as the Diffie–Hellman protocol. For example, in 2014, a secure internet connection to Wikipedia involved the elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman protocol (ECDHE) over a large finite field. In coding theory, many codes are constructed as subspaces of vector spaces over finite fields.

Finite fields are used by many error correction codes, such as Reed–Solomon error correction code or BCH code. The finite field almost always has characteristic of , since computer data is stored in binary. For example, a byte of data can be interpreted as an element of . One exception is PDF417 bar code, which is . Some CPUs have special instructions that can be useful for finite fields of characteristic , generally variations of carry-less product.

Finite fields are widely used in number theory, as many problems over the integers may be solved by reducing them modulo one or several prime numbers. For example, the fastest known algorithms for polynomial factorization and linear algebra over the field of rational numbers proceed by reduction modulo one or several primes, and then reconstruction of the solution by using Chinese remainder theorem, Hensel lifting or the LLL algorithm.

Similarly many theoretical problems in number theory can be solved by considering their reductions modulo some or all prime numbers. See, for example, &quot;Hasse principle&quot;. Many recent developments of algebraic geometry were motivated by the need to enlarge the power of these modular methods. Wiles&#x27; proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem is an example of a deep result involving many mathematical tools, including finite fields.

The Weil conjectures concern the number of points on algebraic varieties over finite fields and the theory has many applications including exponential and character sum estimates.

Finite fields have widespread application in combinatorics, two well known examples being the definition of Paley Graphs and the related construction for Hadamard Matrices. In arithmetic combinatorics finite fields and finite field models are used extensively, such as in Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions.

== Extensions ==
=== Wedderburn&#x27;s little theorem ===
A division ring is a generalization of field. Division rings are not assumed to be commutative. There are no non-commutative finite division rings: Wedderburn&#x27;s little theorem states that all finite division rings are commutative, and hence are finite fields. This result holds even if we relax the associativity axiom to alternativity, that is, all finite alternative division rings are finite fields, by the Artin–Zorn theorem.

=== Algebraic closure ===
A finite field formula_29 is not algebraically closed: the polynomial
formula_377
has no roots in formula_29, since for all formula_121 in formula_29.

Given a prime number , let formula_381 be an algebraic closure of formula_382 It is not only unique up to an isomorphism, as do all algebraic closures, but contrarily to the general case, all its subfield are fixed by all its automorphisms, and it is also the algebraic closure of all finite fields of the same characteristic .

This property results mainly from the fact that the elements of formula_383 are exactly the roots of formula_384 and this defines an inclusion formula_385 for formula_386 These inclusions allow writing informally formula_387 The formal validation of this notation results from the fact that the above field inclusions form a directed set of fields; Its direct limit is formula_388 which may thus be considered as &quot;directed union&quot;.

====Primitive elements in the algebraic closure====

Given a primitive element formula_389 of formula_390 then formula_391 is a primitive element of formula_392

For explicit computations, it may be useful to have a coherent choice of the primitive elements for all finite fields; that is, to choose the primitive element formula_393 of formula_394 in order that, whenever formula_395 one has formula_396 where formula_397 is the primitive element already chosen for formula_398

Such a construction may be obtained by Conway polynomials.

==== Quasi-algebraic closure ====
Although finite fields are not algebraically closed, they are quasi-algebraically closed, which means that every homogeneous polynomial over a finite field has a non-trivial zero whose components are in the field if the number of its variables is more than its degree. This was a conjecture of Artin and Dickson proved by Chevalley (see &quot;Chevalley–Warning theorem&quot;).

<doc id="11616" wikidata="Q171947" url="?curid=11616" title="Franchising">
<text>Franchising is based on a marketing concept which can be adopted by an organization as a strategy for business expansion. Where implemented, a franchisor licenses some or all of its know-how, procedures, intellectual property, use of its business model, brand, and rights to sell its branded products and services to a franchisee. In return, the franchisee pays certain fees and agrees to comply with certain obligations, typically set out in a franchise agreement.

The word &quot;franchise&quot; is of Anglo-French derivation—from , meaning &#x27;free&#x27;—and is used both as a noun and as a (transitive) verb.
For the franchisor, use of a franchise system is an alternative business growth strategy, compared to expansion through corporate owned outlets or &quot;chain stores&quot;. Adopting a franchise system business growth strategy for the sale and distribution of goods and services minimizes the franchisor&#x27;s capital investment and liability risk.

Franchising is rarely an equal partnership, especially in the typical arrangement where the franchisee is an individual, unincorporated partnership or small privately held corporation, as this will ensure the franchisor has substantial legal and/or economic advantages over the franchisee. The usual exception to this rule is when the prospective franchisee is also a powerful corporate entity controlling a highly lucrative location and/or captive market (for example, a large sports stadium) in which prospective franchisors must then compete to exclude one another from. However, under specific circumstances like transparency, favourable legal conditions, financial means and proper market research, franchising can be a vehicle of success for both a large franchisor and a small franchisee.

Thirty-six countries have laws that explicitly regulate franchising, with the majority of all other countries having laws which have a direct or indirect effect on franchising.
Franchising is also used as a foreign market entry mode.

==History==
The boom in franchising did not take place until after World War II. Nevertheless, the rudiments of modern franchising date back to the Middle Ages when landowners made franchise-like agreements with tax collectors, who retained a percentage of the money they collected and turned the rest over. The practice ended around 1562 but spread to other endeavors. For example, in 17th-century England franchisees were granted the right to sponsor markets and fairs or operate ferries. There was little growth in franchising, though, until the mid-19th century, when it appeared in the United States for the first time.

One of the first successful American franchising operations was started by an enterprising druggist named John S. Pemberton. In 1886, he concocted a beverage comprising sugar, molasses, spices, and cocaine. Pemberton licensed selected people to bottle and sell the drink, which was an early version of what is now known as Coca-Cola. His was one of the earliest—and most successful—franchising operations in the United States.

The Singer Company implemented a franchising plan in the 1850s to distribute its sewing machines. The operation failed, though, because the company did not earn much money even though the machines sold well. The dealers, who had exclusive rights to their territories, absorbed most of the profits because of deep discounts. Some failed to push Singer products, so competitors were able to outsell the company. Under the existing contract, Singer could neither withdraw rights granted to franchisees nor send in its own salaried representatives. So, the company started repurchasing the rights it had sold. The experiment proved to be a failure. That may have been one of the first times a franchisor failed, but it was by no means the last. Colonel Harland Sanders did not initially succeed in his early efforts at franchising Kentucky Fried Chicken. Still, the Singer venture did not put an end to franchising.

Other companies attempted franchising in one form or another after the Singer experience. For example, several decades later, General Motors established a somewhat successful franchising operation in order to raise capital. Perhaps the father of modern franchising, though, is Louis K. Liggett. In 1902, Liggett invited a group of druggists to join a &quot;drug cooperative&quot;. As he explained to them, they could increase profits by paying less for their purchases, especially if they set up their own manufacturing company. His idea was to market private label products. About 40 druggists pooled $4,000 of their own money and adopted the name Rexall. Sales soared, and Rexall became a franchisor. The chain&#x27;s success set a pattern for other franchisors to follow.

Although many business owners did affiliate with cooperative ventures of one type or another, there was little growth in franchising until the early 20th century, and in whatever form franchising existed, it looked nothing like what it is today. As the United States shifted from an agricultural to an industrial economy, manufacturers licensed individuals to sell automobiles, trucks, gasoline, beverages, and a variety of other products. The franchisees did little more than selling the products, though. The sharing of responsibility associated with contemporary franchising arrangement did not exist to a great extent. Consequently, franchising was not a growth industry in the United States.

It was not until the 1960s and 1970s that people began to take a close look at the attractiveness of franchising. The concept intrigued people with entrepreneurial spirit. However, there were serious pitfalls for investors, which almost ended the practice before it became truly popular.

The United States is a leader in franchising, a position it has held since the 1930s when it used the approach for fast-food restaurants, food inns and, slightly later, motels at the time of the Great Depression. As of 2005, there were 909,253 established franchised businesses, generating $880.9 billion of output and accounting for 8.1 percent of all private, non-farm jobs. This amounts to 11 million jobs, and 4.4 percent of all private sector output.

Mid-sized franchises like restaurants, gasoline stations and trucking stations involve substantial investment and require all the attention of a businessperson.

There are also large franchises like hotels, spas and hospitals, which are discussed further under technological alliances.

&quot;No poaching&quot; agreements are prevalent within franchises, thus limiting the ability of employers at one franchise establishment to hire employees at an affiliated franchise. Economists have characterized these agreements as a contributor to oligopsony.

==Fees and contract arrangement==
Three important payments are made to a franchisor: (a) a royalty for the trademark, (b) reimbursement for the training and advisory services given to the franchisee, and (c) a percentage of the individual business unit&#x27;s sales. These three fees may be combined in a single &#x27;management&#x27; fee. A fee for &quot;disclosure&quot; is separate and is always a &quot;front-end fee&quot;.

A franchise usually lasts for a fixed time period (broken down into shorter periods, which each require renewal), and serves a specific territory or geographical area surrounding its location. One franchisee may manage several such locations. Agreements typically last from five to thirty years, with premature cancellations or terminations of most contracts bearing serious consequences for franchisees. A franchise is merely a temporary business investment involving renting or leasing an opportunity, not the purchase of a business for the purpose of ownership. It is classified as a wasting asset due to the finite term of the license.

Franchise fees are on average 6.7% with an additional average marketing fee of 2%. However, not all franchise opportunities are the same and many franchise organizations are pioneering new models that challenge antiquated structures and redefine success for the organization as well as the franchisee.

A franchise can be exclusive, non-exclusive or &quot;sole and exclusive&quot;.

Although franchisor revenues and profit may be listed in a franchise disclosure document (FDD), no laws require an estimate of franchisee profitability, which depends on how intensively the franchisee &quot;works&quot; the franchise. Therefore, franchisor fees are typically based on &quot;gross revenue from sales&quot; and not on profits realized. See remuneration.

Various tangibles and intangibles such as national or international advertising, training and other support services are commonly made available by the franchisor.

Franchise brokers help franchisors find appropriate franchisees. There are also main &#x27;master franchisors&#x27; who obtain the rights to sub-franchise in a territory.

According to the International Franchise Association approximately 44% of all businesses in the United States are franchisee-worked.

==Rationale and risk shift==
Franchising is one of the few means available to access venture capital without the need to give up control of the operation of the chain and build a distribution system for servicing it. After the brand and formula are carefully designed and properly executed, franchisors are able to sell franchises and expand rapidly across countries and continents using the capital and resources of their franchisees while reducing their own risk.

There is also risk for the people buying the franchises. However, failure rates are much lower for franchise businesses than independent business startups.

Franchisor rules imposed by the franchising authority are becoming increasingly strict. Some franchisors are using minor rule violations to terminate contracts and seize the franchise without any reimbursement.

== Advantages and disadvantages of franchising as an entry mode ==
Franchising brings with it several advantages and disadvantages for firms looking to expand into new areas and foreign markets. The primary advantage is that the firm does not have to bear the development cost and risks of opening a foreign market on its own, as the franchisee is typically responsible for those costs and risks, putting the onus on them to build a profitable operation as quickly as possible. Through franchising, a firm has the potential of building a global presence quickly and also at a low cost and risk.

For the franchisee, the primary advantages are access to a well-known brand, support in setting up the business using operating manuals, and ongoing operational support including access to suppliers and employee training.

A primary disadvantage to franchising is quality control, as the franchisor wants the firm&#x27;s brand name to convey a message to consumers about the quality and consistency of the firm&#x27;s product. They want the consumer to experience the same quality regardless of location or franchise status. This can prove to be an issue with franchising, as a customer who had a bad experience at one franchise may assume that they will have the same experience at other locations with other services. Distance can make it difficult for firms to detect whether or not the franchises are of poor quality. One way around this disadvantage is to set up extra subsidiaries in each country or state in which the firm expands. This creates a smaller number of franchisees to oversee, which will reduce the quality control challenges.

==Obligations of the parties==
Each party to a franchise has several interests to protect. The franchisor is involved in securing protection for the trademark, controlling the business concept and securing know-how. The franchisee is obligated to carry out the services for which the trademark has been made prominent or famous. There is a great deal of standardization required. The place of service has to bear the franchisor&#x27;s signs, logos and trademark in a prominent place. The uniforms worn by the staff of the franchisee have to be of a particular design and color. The service has to be in accordance with the pattern followed by the franchisor in the successful franchise operations. Thus, franchisees are not in full control of the business, as they would be in retailing.

A service can be successful if equipment and supplies are purchased at a fair price from the franchisor or sources recommended by the franchisor. A coffee brew, for example, can be readily identified by the trademark if its raw materials come from a particular supplier. If the franchisor requires purchase from her stores, it may come under anti-trust legislation or equivalent laws of other countries. So, too, with purchases such as the uniforms of personnel and signs, as well as the franchise sites, if they are owned or controlled by the franchisor.

The franchisee must carefully negotiate the license and must develop a marketing or business plan with the franchisor. The fees must be fully disclosed and there should not be any hidden fees. The start-up costs and working capital must be known before the license is granted. There must be assurance that additional licensees will not crowd the &quot;territory&quot; if the franchise is worked according to plan. The franchisee must be seen as an independent merchant. It must be protected by the franchisor from any trademark infringement by third parties. A franchise attorney is required to assist the franchisee during negotiations.

Often the training period – the costs of which are in great part covered by the initial fee – is too short in cases where it is necessary to operate complicated equipment, and the franchisee has to learn on their own from instruction manuals. The training period must be adequate, but in low-cost franchises it may be considered expensive. Many franchisors have set up corporate universities to train staff online. This is in addition to providing literature, sales documents and email access.

Also, franchise agreements carry no guarantees or warranties and the franchisee has little or no recourse to legal intervention in the event of a dispute. Franchise contracts tend to be unilateral and favor of the franchisor, who is generally protected from lawsuits from their franchisees because of the non-negotiable contracts that franchisees are required to acknowledge, in effect, that they are buying the franchise knowing that there is risk, and that they have not been promised success or profits by the franchisor. Contracts are renewable at the sole option of the franchisor. Most franchisors require franchisees to sign agreements that mandate where and under what law any dispute would be litigated.

==Regulations==
===Australia===
In 2016 there were an estimated 1,120 franchise brands operating in Australia and an estimated 79,000 units operating in business format franchises, with a total brand turnover of approximately $146 billion and a sales revenue of approximately $66.5 billion. In 2016 the majority of franchise brands were retailers with the largest segment being non-food retailing, accounting for 26 percent of brands, a further 19 percent of brands were involved in food retailing, 15 percent of franchisors operated in administration and support services, 10 percent in other services, 7 percent in education and training and 7 percent in rental, hire and real estate services.

Franchising in Australia commenced in a significant way in the early 1970s under the influence of the franchised US fast food systems such as KFC, Pizza Hut, and McDonald&#x27;s. It was however underway prior to this and a decade earlier in 1960 Leslie Joseph Hooker, considered a pioneer of franchising, created Australia&#x27;s first national real estate agency network of Hooker real estate agencies.

In Australia, franchising is regulated by the Franchising Code of Conduct, a mandatory code of conduct concluded under the Trade Practices Act 1974.
The ACCC regulates the Franchising Code of Conduct, which is a mandatory industry code that applies to the parties to a franchise agreement.
This code requires franchisors to produce a disclosure document which must be given to a prospective franchisee at least 14 days before the franchise agreement is entered into.

The code also regulates the content of franchise agreements, for example in relation to marketing funds, a cooling-off period, termination, and the resolution of disputes by mediation.

On 1 January 2015, the old Franchising Code was repealed and replaced with a new Franchising Code of Conduct. The new Code applies to conduct on or after 1 January 2015.

The new Code:
* introduces an obligation under the Code for parties to act in good faith in their dealings with one another
* introduces financial penalties and infringement notices for serious breaches of the Code
* requires franchisors to provide prospective franchisees with a short information sheet outlining the risks and rewards of franchising
* requires franchisors to provide greater transparency in the use of and accounting for money used for marketing and advertising and to set up a separate marketing fund for marketing and advertising fees
* requires additional disclosure about the ability of the franchisor and a franchisee to sell online
* prohibits franchisors from imposing significant capital expenditure except in limited circumstances.

These are significant changes and it is important that franchisors, franchisees and potential franchises understand their rights and responsibilities under the Code.

For further information about the changes to the Code, please see the updated Franchisor Compliance Manual and the Franchisee Manual.

The Code explanatory materials are available from the ComLaw website (link is external).

===New Zealand===
New Zealand is served by around 423 franchise systems operating 450 brands, giving it the highest proportion of franchises per capita in the world. Despite (or because of) the 2008–2009 recession, the total number of franchised units increased by 5.3% from 2009 to 2010. There is no separate law covering franchises, so they are covered by normal commercial law. This functions very well in New Zealand and includes law as it applies to contracts, restrictive trade practices, intellectual property, and the law of misleading or deceptive conduct.

The Franchise Association of New Zealand introduced a self-regulatory code of practice for its members in 1996. This contains many provisions similar to those of the Australian Franchising Code of Practice legislation, although only around a third of all franchises are members of the association and therefore bound by the code.

A case of fraud in 2007 perpetrated by a former master franchisee of the country&#x27;s largest franchise system led to a review of the need for franchise law by the Ministry of Economic Development. The New Zealand Government decided there was no case for franchise-specific legislation at that time. This decision was criticised by the opposition, which had initiated the review when in power, and the review process was questioned by a leading academic. The Franchise Association originally supported the positive regulation of the franchise sector but its eventual submission to the review was in favour of the status quo of self-regulation.

===Brazil===
By the end of 2012, about 2,031 franchise brands were operating in Brazil, with approximately 93,000 locations, making it one of the largest countries in the world in terms of number of units. Around 11 percent of this total were foreign-based franchisors.

The Brazilian Franchise Law (Law No. 8955 of December 15, 1994) defines the franchise as a system in which the franchisor licenses the franchisee, for a payment, the right to use a trademark or patent along with the right to distribute products or services on an exclusive or semi-exclusive basis.
The provision of a &quot;Franchise Offer Circular&quot;, or disclosure document, is mandatory before execution of agreement and is valid for all of the Brazilian territory. Failure to disclose voids the agreement, which leads to refunds and serious payments for damages. The Franchise Law does not distinguish between Brazilian and foreign franchisors. The National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) is the registering authority. Indispensable documents are a Statement of Delivery (of disclosure documentation) and a Certification of Recording (INPI). The latter is necessary for payments. All sums may not be convertible into foreign currency. Certification may also mean compliance with Brazil&#x27;s antitrust legislation.

Parties to international franchising may decide to adopt the English language for the document, as long as the Brazilian party knows English fluently and expressly acknowledges that fact, to avoid translation. The registration accomplishes three things:

: * It make the agreement effective against third parties
: * It permits the remittance of payments
: * It qualifies the franchisee for tax deductions.

===Canada===
In Canada, recent legislation has mandated better disclosure and fair treatment of franchisees. The regulations also ensure their right to form associations and launch collective action, even if they signed contracts prohibiting such moves. Franchising in Canada involves 1,300 brands, 80,000 franchise units accounting for about 20% of all consumer spending.

===China===
China has the most franchises in the world but the scale of their operations is relatively small. The average franchise system in China has about 45 outlets, compared to more than 540 in the United States. Together, there are 2600 brands in some 200,000 retail markets. KFC was the most significant foreign entry in 1987 and is widespread. Many franchises are in fact joint-ventures, as at their forming the franchise law was not explicit. For example, McDonald&#x27;s is a joint venture. Pizza Hut, TGIF, Wal-mart, Starbucks followed not long thereafter. But total franchising is only 3% of retail trade, which seeks foreign franchise growth.

The year 2005 saw the birth of an updated franchise law, &quot;Measures for the Administration of Commercial Franchise&quot;. Previous legislation (1997) made no specific inclusion of foreign investors. Further updates were made in 2007, with the objective of increased clarity of the law.

The laws are applicable if there are transactions involving a trademark combined with payments with many obligations on the franchisor. The law comprises 42 articles and eight chapters.

Among the franchisor obligations are:
* The FIE (foreign-invested enterprise) franchisor must be registered by the regulator
* The franchisor (or its subsidiary) must have operated at least two company-owned franchises in China (revised to &quot;anywhere&quot;) for more than 12 months (&quot;the two-shop, one-year&quot; rule)
* The franchisor must disclose any information requested by the franchisee
* Cross-border franchising, with some caveats, is possible (2007 law).

The franchisor must meet a list of requirements for registration, among which are:
* The standard franchise agreement, working manual and working capital requirements,
* A track-record of operations, and ample ability to supply materials,
* The ability to train the Chinese personnel and provide long-term operational guidance,
* The franchise agreement must have a minimum three-year term.

Among other provisions:
* The franchisor is liable for certain actions of its suppliers
* Monetary and other penalties apply for infractions of the regulations.

The disclosure must take place 20 days in advance. It has to contain:
* Details of the franchisor&#x27;s experience in the franchised business with scope of business
* Identification of the franchisor&#x27;s principal officers
* Litigation of the franchisor during the past five years
* Full details about all franchise fees
* The amount of a franchisee&#x27;s initial investment
* A list of the goods or services the franchisor can supply, and the terms of supply
* The training franchisees will receive
* Information about the trademarks, including registration, usage and litigation
* Demonstration of the franchisor&#x27;s capabilities to provide training and guidance
* Statistics about existing units, including number, locations and operational results, and the percentage of franchises that have been terminated, and
* An audited financial report and tax information (for an unspecified period of time).

Other elements of this legislation are:
* The franchisee&#x27;s confidentiality obligations continue indefinitely after termination or expiration of the franchise agreement
* If the franchisee has paid a deposit to the franchisor, it must be refunded on termination of the franchise agreement; upon termination, the franchisee is prohibited from continuing to use the franchisor&#x27;s marks.

===India===
The franchising of foreign goods and services to India is in its infancy. The first International Exhibition was only held in 2009. India is, however, one of the biggest franchising markets because of its large middle-class of 300 million who are not reticent about spending and because the population is entrepreneurial in character. In a highly diversified society, (see Demographics of India) McDonald&#x27;s is a success story despite its menu differing from that of the rest of the world.

So far, franchise agreements are covered under two standard commercial laws: the Contract Act 1872 and the Specific Relief Act 1963, which provide for both specific enforcement of covenants in a contract and remedies in the form of damages for breach of contract.

===Kazakhstan===
In Kazakhstan franchise turnover for 2013 is US$2.5 billion per year. Kazakhstan is the leader in Central Asia in the franchising market. A special law on franchising came into effect in 2002. There are more than 300 franchise systems and the number of franchised outlets approaches 2000. Kazakhstan franchising began with the emergence of a Coca-Cola factory, opened to sublicense a Turkish licensor of the same brand. The plant was built in 1994. Other brands that are also present in Kazakhstan through the franchise system include Pepsi, Hilton, Marriott, Intercontinental, and Pizza Hut.

===Europe===
Franchising has grown rapidly in Europe in recent years, but the industry is largely unregulated. The European Union has not adopted a uniform franchise law. Only six of the 27 member states have a pre-contract disclosure law. They are France (1989), Spain (1996), Romania (1997), Italy (2004), Sweden (2004) and Belgium (2005). Estonia and Lithuania have franchise laws that impose mandatory terms on franchise agreements. In Spain there is also mandatory registration on a public registry. Although they have no franchise specific laws, Germany and those countries with a legal system based upon that of Germany, such as Austria, Greece and Portugal, probably impose the greatest regulatory burden on franchisors due to their tendency to treat franchisees as quasi consumers in certain circumstances and the willingness of the judiciary to use the concept of good faith to make pro-franchisee decisions. In the UK, the recent Papa John case shows that there is also a need for pre-contractual disclosure and the Yam Seng case shows that there is a duty of good faith in franchise relationships.

The European Franchising Federation&#x27;s Code of Ethics has been adopted by seventeen national franchise associations. However this has no legal force and enforcement by the national associations is neither uniform of rigorous. Commentators like Dr Mark Abell, in his book &quot;The Law and Regulation of Franchising in the EU&quot; (published in 2013 by Edward Elgar, ) consider this lack of uniformity to be one of the greatest barriers to franchising realising its potential in the EU.

When adopting a European strategy, it is important that a franchisor takes expert legal advice. Most often one of the principal tasks in Europe is to find retail space, which is not so significant a factor in the US. This is where the franchise broker, or the master franchisor, plays an important role. Cultural factors are also relevant, as local populations tend to be heterogeneous.

====France====
France is one of Europe&#x27;s largest markets. Similar to the United States, it has a long history of franchising, dating back to the 1930s. Growth came in the 1970s. The market is considered difficult for outside franchisors because of cultural characteristics, yet McDonald&#x27;s and Century 21 are found everywhere. There are some 30 U.S. firms involved in franchising in France.

There are no government agencies regulating franchises. The Loi Doubin Law of 1989 was the first European franchise disclosure law. Combined with Decree No. 91-337, it regulates disclosure, although the decree also applies to any person who provides to another person a corporate name, trademark or trade name or other business arrangements. The law applies to &quot;exclusive or quasi-exclusive territory&quot;. The disclosure document must be delivered at least 20 days before the execution of the agreement or any payments are made.

The specific and important disclosures to be made are:

# The date of the founding of the franchisor&#x27;s enterprise and a summary of its business history and all information necessary to assess the business experience of the franchisor, including bankers,
# A description of the local market for the goods or services,
# The franchisor&#x27;s financial statements for the previous two years,
# A list of all other franchisees currently in the network,
# All franchisees who have left the network during the preceding year, whether by termination or non-renewal, and
# The conditions for renewal, assignment, termination and the scope of exclusivity.

Initially, there was some uncertainty whether any breach of the provisions of the Doubin Law would enable the franchisee to walk away from the contract.
However, the French supreme court () eventually ruled that agreements should only be annulled where missing or incorrect information affected the decision of the franchisee to enter into the agreement. The burden of proof is on the franchisee.

Dispute settlement features are only incorporated in some European countries. By not being rigorous, franchising is encouraged.

====Italy====
Under Italian law franchise is defined as an arrangement between two financially independent parties where a franchisee is granted, in exchange for a consideration, the right to market goods and services under particular trademarks. In addition, articles dictate the form and content of the franchise agreement and define the documents that must be made available 30 days prior to execution. The franchisor must disclose:

:a) A summary of the franchise activities and operations,
:b) A list of franchisees currently operating in the franchise system in Italy,
:c) Year-by-year details of the changes in the number of franchisees for the previous three years in Italy,
:d) A summary of any court or arbitral proceedings in Italy related to the franchise system, and
:e) If requested by the franchisee, copies of franchisor&#x27;s balance sheets for the previous three years, or since start-up if that period is shorter.

====Norway====
There are no specific laws regulating franchising in Norway. However, the Norwegian Competition Act section 10 prohibits cooperation which may prevent, limit or diminish the competition. This may also apply to vertical cooperation such as franchising.

====Russia====
In Russia, under chapter 54 of the Civil Code (passed 1996), franchise agreements are invalid unless written and registered, and franchisors cannot set standards or limits on the prices of the franchisee&#x27;s goods. Enforcement of laws and resolution of contractual disputes is a problem: Dunkin&#x27; Donuts chose to terminate its contract with Russian franchisees who were selling vodka and meat patties contrary to their contracts, rather than pursue legal remedies.

====Spain====
The legal definition of franchising in Spain is an activity in which an undertaking, the franchisor, grants to another party, the franchisee, for a specific market and in exchange for financial compensation (either direct, indirect or both), the right to exploit an owned system to commercialize products or services already exploited by the franchisor with enough success and experience.

The Spanish Retail Trading Act regulates franchising. The contents of the franchise must include, at least:
* The use of a common name or brand or any other intellectual property right and a uniform presentation of the premises or the transport means included in the agreement.
* The communication by the franchisor to the franchise of certain technical knowledge or substantial and singular know-how that has to be owned by the franchisor, and
* Technical or commercial assistance or both, provided by the franchisor to the franchisee during the agreement, without prejudice to any supervision faculty to which the parties could freely agree in the contract.

In Spain, the franchisor submits the disclosure information 20 days prior to signing the agreement or prior to any payment made by the franchisee to the franchisor. Franchisors are to disclose to the potential franchisee specific information in writing. This information has to be true and not misleading and include:
* Identification of the franchisor;
* Justification of ownership or license for use of any trademark or similar sign and judicial claims affecting them as well as the duration of the license;
* General description of the sector in which the franchise operates;
* Experience of the franchisor;
* Contents and characteristics of the franchise and its exploitation;
* Structure and extension of the network in Spain;
* Essential elements of the franchise agreement.

Franchisors (with some exceptions) should be registered in the Franchisors&#x27; Register and provide the requested information. According to the regulation in force in 2010 this obligation has to be met within three months after the start of its activities in Spain.

====Turkey====
Franchising is a sui generis contract which bears the characteristics of several explicitly regulated contracts such as; agency, sales contract and so forth. The regulations concerning these kinds of contracts in Turkish Commercial Code and in Turkish Code of Obligations are applied to franchising. Franchising is described in doctrine and has several essential components such as; the independence of the franchisee from the franchisor, the use of know-how and the uniformity of product and services, standard use of the brand and logo, payment of a royalty fee, increasement of sales by the franchisee and continuity.
Franchising may be for a determined or undetermined period of time. The undetermined one can only be annulled either by a notice before a reasonable amount of time or by a just cause. The franchising agreement with a determined time period ends within the end of the time period if not specified otherwise in the agreement. However, termination based on just cause is also foreseen for franchising agreement with a determined time period.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom there are no franchise-specific laws, and franchises are subject to the same laws that govern other businesses. Even without direct legislation, judicial decisions indicate that a franchisor is expected to provide a clear disclosure of relevant facts before the franchisee enters into a franchise, and that franchisors have a duty of good faith. The Trading Schemes Act, which governs arrangements in which participants may receive a benefit or reward for introducing other participants to a scheme or sell goods or services provided by the person who is promoting the scheme, may apply to multi-tiered franchises. The industry engages in some self-regulation through the British Franchise Association (BFA) and the Quality Franchise Association (QFA).

There are a number of franchise businesses which are not members of the BFA and many which do not meet the BFA membership criteria. Part of the BFA&#x27;s role in self-regulation is to work with franchisors through the application process and recommend changes which will lead to the franchise business meeting BFA standards. A number of businesses that refer to themselves as franchises do not conform to the BFA Code of Ethics are therefore excluded from membership.

On 22 May 2007, hearings were held in the UK Parliament concerning citizen-initiated petitions for special regulation of franchising by the government of the UK due to losses incurred by citizens who had invested in franchises. The Minister for Industry and the Regions, Margaret Hodge, conducted hearings but saw no need for any government regulation of franchising with the advice that government regulation of franchising might lull the public into a false sense of security. Mr Mark Prisk MP suggested that the costs of such regulation to the franchisee and franchisor could be prohibitive and would in any case provide a system which mirrored the work already being completed by the BFA. The Minister for Industry and the Regions indicated that if due diligence were performed by the investors and the banks, the current laws governing business contracts in the UK offered sufficient protection for the public and the banks. The debate also made reference to the self-regulatory function performed by the BFA recognizing that the association &quot;punched above its weight&quot;.

In the 2010 case of &quot;MGB Printing v Kall Kwik UK Ltd.&quot;, the High Court established that a franchisor may assume a duty of care to a franchisee in certain circumstances. Kall Kwik, a design and print franchisor, had incorrectly advised MGB, who was purchasing a franchise, of the costs of undertaking refit work needed to meet Kall Kwik&#x27;s franchising requirements. In this particular case, Kall Kwik had stated that they would provide professional advice to potential franchisees, and because they had not provided details of the fitting standards which must be met, they had encouraged MGB to rely on the advice offered by themselves.

On 3 June 2021, it was announced that the Approved Franchise Association (AFA) would merge with the British Franchise Association (BFA) and that both franchise associations would operate under the BFA umbrella.

===United States===
Isaac Singer, who made improvements to an existing model of a sewing machine in the 1850s, began one of the first franchising efforts in the United States, followed later by Coca-Cola, Western Union, and by agreements between automobile manufacturers and dealers.

Modern franchising came to prominence with the rise of franchise-based food service establishments. In 1932, Howard Deering Johnson established the first modern restaurant franchise based on his successful Quincy, Massachusetts Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant founded in the late 1920s. The idea was to let independent operators use the same name, food, supplies, logo and even building design in exchange for a fee. The growth in franchising accelerated in the 1930s when such chains as Howard Johnson&#x27;s started to franchise motels. The 1950s saw a boom in franchise chains in conjunction with the development of the U.S. Interstate Highway System and the growing popularity of fast food.

The Federal Trade Commission has oversight of franchising via the FTC Franchise Rule.

The FTC requires that the franchisee be furnished with a Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) by the franchisor at least fourteen days before money changes hands or a franchise agreement is signed. Whereas elements of the disclosure may be available from third parties, only that provided by the franchisor can be depended upon. The U.S. Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) is lengthy (300–700 pp +) and detailed (see Franchise Disclosure Document, above), and generally requires audited financial statements from the franchisor in a particular format, except in some circumstances, such as where a franchisor is new. It must include such data as the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the franchisees in the licensed territory (who may be contacted and consulted before negotiations), estimate of total franchise revenues and franchisor profitability.

Individual states may require the FDD to contain their own specific requirements, but the requirements in state disclosure documents must be in compliance with the federal rule that governs federal regulatory policy. There is no private right of action of action under the FTC rule for franchisor violation of the rule, but fifteen or more of the states have passed statutes that provide this right of action to franchisees when fraud can be proven under these special statutes. The majority of franchisors have inserted mandatory arbitration clauses into their agreements with their franchisees, some of which the U.S. Supreme Court has dealt with.

In response to the implementation of California Assembly Bill 5 (2019) which limits the use of classifying workers as independent contractors rather than employees in California, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reinstated its decision in Vazquez v. Jan-Pro which impacts California franchise law and California independent contractor law by making it unclear that if a franchisor licenses its trademark to a franchisee, whether the franchisor incurs the liabilities of an employer for a franchisee&#x27;s employees.

There is no federal registry of franchises or any federal filing requirements for information. States are the primary collectors of data on franchising companies and enforce laws and regulations regarding their presence and their spread in their jurisdictions.

Where the franchisor has many partners, the agreement may take the shape of a business format franchise – an agreement that is identical for all franchisees.

==Social franchises==
In recent years, the idea of franchising has been picked up by the social enterprise sector, which hopes to simplify and expedite the process of setting up new businesses. A number of business ideas, such as soap making, wholefood retailing, aquarium maintenance, and hotel operation have been identified as suitable for adoption by social firms employing disabled and disadvantaged people.

The most successful examples are probably the &quot;Kringwinkel&quot; second-hand shops employing 5,000 people in Flanders, franchised by KOMOSIE, the CAP Markets, a steadily growing chain of 100 neighbourhood supermarkets in Germany. and the Hotel Tritone in Trieste, which inspired the Le Mat social franchise, now active in Italy and Sweden.

Social franchising also refers to a technique used by governments and aid donors to provide essential clinical health services in the developing world.

Social Franchise Enterprises objective is to achieve development goals by creating self sustainable activities by providing services and goods in un-served areas. They use the Franchise Model characteristics to deliver Capacity Building, Access to Market and Access to Credit/Finance.

==Third-party logistics franchising==
Third-party logistics has become an increasingly more popular franchise opportunity due to the quickly growing transportation industry and low cost franchising. In 2012, &quot;Inc. Magazine&quot; ranked three logistics and transportation companies in the top 100 fastest growing companies in the annual Inc. 5000 rankings.

==Event franchising==
Event franchising is the duplication of public events in other geographical areas, retaining the original brand (logo), mission, concept and format of the event. As in classic franchising, event franchising is built on precisely copying successful events. An example of event franchising is the World Economic Forum, also known as the Davos forum, which has regional event franchisees in China, Latin America, etc. Likewise, the alter-globalist World Social Forum has launched many national events. When The Music Stops is an example of an events franchise in the UK, in this case, running speed dating and singles events.

==Home-based franchises==
The franchising or duplication of another firm&#x27;s successful home-based business model is referred to as a home-based franchise. Home-based franchises are becoming popular as they are considered to be an easy way to start a business as they may provide a low barrier for entry into entrepreneurship. It may cost little to start a home-based franchise, but experts say that &quot;the work is no less hard.&quot;

<text>In theoretical physics, a Feynman diagram is a pictorial representation of the mathematical expressions describing the behavior and interaction of subatomic particles. The scheme is named after American physicist Richard Feynman, who introduced the diagrams in 1948. 

The calculation of probability amplitudes in theoretical particle physics requires the use of large, complicated integrals over a large number of variables. Feynman diagrams instead represent these integrals graphically.

Feynman diagrams give a simple visualization of what would otherwise be an arcane and abstract formula. According to David Kaiser, &quot;Since the middle of the 20th century, theoretical physicists have increasingly turned to this tool to help them undertake critical calculations. Feynman diagrams have revolutionized nearly every aspect of theoretical physics.&quot; 

While the diagrams apply primarily to quantum field theory, they can be used in other areas of physics, such as solid-state theory. Frank Wilczek wrote that the calculations that won him the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;would have been literally unthinkable without Feynman diagrams, as would [Wilczek&#x27;s] calculations that established a route to production and observation of the Higgs particle.&quot;

A Feynman diagram is a graphical representation of a perturbative contribution to the transition amplitude or correlation function of a quantum mechanical or statistical field theory. Within the canonical formulation of quantum field theory, a Feynman diagram represents a term in the Wick&#x27;s expansion of the perturbative -matrix. Alternatively, the path integral formulation of quantum field theory represents the transition amplitude as a weighted sum of all possible histories of the system from the initial to the final state, in terms of either particles or fields. The transition amplitude is then given as the matrix element of the -matrix between the initial and final states of the quantum system.

Feynman used Ernst Stueckelberg&#x27;s interpretation of the positron as if it were an electron moving backward in time. Thus, antiparticles are represented as moving backward along the time axis in Feynman diagrams.

== Motivation and history ==
When calculating scattering cross-sections in particle physics, the interaction between particles can be described by starting from a free field that describes the incoming and outgoing particles, and including an interaction Hamiltonian to describe how the particles deflect one another. The amplitude for scattering is the sum of each possible interaction history over all possible intermediate particle states. The number of times the interaction Hamiltonian acts is the order of the perturbation expansion, and the time-dependent perturbation theory for fields is known as the Dyson series. When the intermediate states at intermediate times are energy eigenstates (collections of particles with a definite momentum) the series is called old-fashioned perturbation theory (or time-dependent/time-ordered perturbation theory).

The Dyson series can be alternatively rewritten as a sum over Feynman diagrams, where at each vertex both the energy and momentum are conserved, but where the length of the energy-momentum four-vector is not necessarily equal to the mass, i.e. the intermediate particles are so-called off-shell. The Feynman diagrams are much easier to keep track of than &quot;old-fashioned&quot; terms, because the old-fashioned way treats the particle and antiparticle contributions as separate. Each Feynman diagram is the sum of exponentially many old-fashioned terms, because each internal line can separately represent either a particle or an antiparticle. In a non-relativistic theory, there are no antiparticles and there is no doubling, so each Feynman diagram includes only one term.

Feynman gave a prescription for calculating the amplitude (the Feynman rules, below) for any given diagram from a field theory Lagrangian. Each internal line corresponds to a factor of the virtual particle&#x27;s propagator; each vertex where lines meet gives a factor derived from an interaction term in the Lagrangian, and incoming and outgoing lines carry an energy, momentum, and spin.

In addition to their value as a mathematical tool, Feynman diagrams provide deep physical insight into the nature of particle interactions. Particles interact in every way available; in fact, intermediate virtual particles are allowed to propagate faster than light. The probability of each final state is then obtained by summing over all such possibilities. This is closely tied to the functional integral formulation of quantum mechanics, also invented by Feynman—see path integral formulation.

The naïve application of such calculations often produces diagrams whose amplitudes are infinite, because the short-distance particle interactions require a careful limiting procedure, to include particle self-interactions. The technique of renormalization, suggested by Ernst Stueckelberg and Hans Bethe and implemented by Dyson, Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga compensates for this effect and eliminates the troublesome infinities. After renormalization, calculations using Feynman diagrams match experimental results with very high accuracy.

Feynman diagram and path integral methods are also used in statistical mechanics and can even be applied to classical mechanics.

=== Alternate names ===
Murray Gell-Mann always referred to Feynman diagrams as Stueckelberg diagrams, after Swiss physicist Ernst Stueckelberg, who devised a similar notation many years earlier. Stueckelberg was motivated by the need for a manifestly covariant formalism for quantum field theory, but did not provide as automated a way to handle symmetry factors and loops, although he was first to find the correct physical interpretation in terms of forward and backward in time particle paths, all without the path-integral.

Historically, as a book-keeping device of covariant perturbation theory, the graphs were called Feynman–Dyson diagrams or Dyson graphs, because the path integral was unfamiliar when they were introduced, and Freeman Dyson&#x27;s derivation from old-fashioned perturbation theory borrowed from the perturbative expansions in statistical mechanics was easier to follow for physicists trained in earlier methods. Feynman had to lobby hard for the diagrams, which confused physicists trained in equations and graphs.

== Representation of physical reality ==
In their presentations of fundamental interactions, written from the particle physics perspective, Gerard &#x27;t Hooft and Martinus Veltman gave good arguments for taking the original, non-regularized Feynman diagrams as the most succinct representation of the physics of quantum scattering of fundamental particles. Their motivations are consistent with the convictions of James Daniel Bjorken and Sidney Drell:

The Feynman graphs and rules of calculation summarize quantum field theory in a form in close contact with the experimental numbers one wants to understand. Although the statement of the theory in terms of graphs may imply perturbation theory, use of graphical methods in the many-body problem shows that this formalism is flexible enough to deal with phenomena of nonperturbative characters ... Some modification of the Feynman rules of calculation may well outlive the elaborate mathematical structure of local canonical quantum field theory ...

In quantum field theories, Feynman diagrams are obtained from a Lagrangian by Feynman rules.

Dimensional regularization is a method for regularizing integrals in the evaluation of Feynman diagrams; it assigns values to them that are meromorphic functions of an auxiliary complex parameter , called the dimension. Dimensional regularization writes a Feynman integral as an integral depending on the spacetime dimension and spacetime points.

== Particle-path interpretation ==
A Feynman diagram is a representation of quantum field theory processes in terms of particle interactions. The particles are represented by the diagram lines. The lines can be squiggly or straight, with an arrow or without, depending on the type of particle. A point where lines connect to other lines is a vertex, and this is where the particles meet and interact. The interactions are: emit/absorb particles, deflect particles, or change particle type.

The three different types of lines are: internal lines, connecting vertices, incoming lines, extending from &quot;the past&quot; to a vertex, representing an initial state, and outgoing lines, extending from a vertex to &quot;the future&quot;, representing the end state (the latter two are also known as external lines). Traditionally, the bottom of the diagram is the past and the top the future; alternatively, the past is to the left and the future to the right. When calculating correlation functions instead of scattering amplitudes, past and future are not relevant and all lines are internal. The particles then begin and end on small x&#x27;s, which represent the positions of the operators whose correlation is calculated.

Feynman diagrams are a pictorial representation of a contribution to the total amplitude for a process that can happen in different ways. When a group of incoming particles scatter off each other, the process can be thought of as one where the particles travel over all possible paths, including paths that go backward in time.

Feynman diagrams are graphs that represent the interaction of particles rather than the physical position of the particle during a scattering process. They are not the same as spacetime diagrams and bubble chamber images even though they all describe particle scattering. Unlike a bubble chamber picture, only the sum of all relevant Feynman diagrams represent any given particle interaction; particles do not choose a particular diagram each time they interact. The law of summation is in accord with the principle of superposition—every diagram contributes to the total process&#x27;s amplitude.

== Description ==

A Feynman diagram represents a perturbative contribution to the amplitude of a quantum transition from some initial quantum state to some final quantum state.

For example, in the process of electron-positron annihilation the initial state is one electron and one positron, while the final state is two photons.

Conventionally, the initial state is at the left of the diagram and the final state at the right (although other layouts are also used).

The particles in the initial state are depicted by lines pointing in the direction of the initial state (e.g., to the left). The particles in the final state are represented by lines pointing in the direction of the final state (e.g., to the right).

QED involves two types of particles: matter particles such as electrons or positrons (called fermions) and exchange particles (called gauge bosons). They are represented in Feynman diagrams as follows:
* Electron in the initial state is represented by a solid line, with an arrow indicating the spin of the particle e.g. pointing toward the vertex (→•).
* Electron in the final state is represented by a line, with an arrow indicating the spin of the particle e.g. pointing away from the vertex: (•→).
* Positron in the initial state is represented by a solid line, with an arrow indicating the spin of the particle e.g. pointing away from the vertex: (←•).
* Positron in the final state is represented by a line, with an arrow indicating the spin of the particle e.g. pointing toward the vertex: (•←).
* Virtual Photon in the initial and the final states is represented by a wavy line (~• and •~).

In QED each vertex has three lines attached to it: one bosonic line, one fermionic line with arrow toward the vertex, and one fermionic line with arrow away from the vertex.

Vertices can be connected by a bosonic or fermionic propagator. A bosonic propagator is represented by a wavy line connecting two vertices (•~•). A fermionic propagator is represented by a solid line with an arrow connecting two vertices, (•←•).

The number of vertices gives the order of the term in the perturbation series expansion of the transition amplitude.

=== Electron–positron annihilation example ===
The electron–positron annihilation interaction:

:e+ + e− → 2γ

has a contribution from the second order Feynman diagram:

In the initial state (at the bottom; early time) there is one electron (e−) and one positron (e+) and in the final state (at the top; late time) there are two photons (γ).

== Canonical quantization formulation ==
The probability amplitude for a transition of a quantum system (between asymptotically free states) from the initial state to the final state is given by the matrix element

:formula_1

where is the -matrix. In terms of the time-evolution operator , it is simply

:formula_2

In the interaction picture, this expands to

:formula_3

where is the interaction Hamiltonian and signifies the time-ordered product of operators. Dyson&#x27;s formula expands the time-ordered matrix exponential into a perturbation series in the powers of the interaction Hamiltonian density,

:formula_4

Equivalently, with the interaction Lagrangian , it is

:formula_5

A Feynman diagram is a graphical representation of a single summand in the Wick&#x27;s expansion of the time-ordered product in the th-order term of the Dyson series of the -matrix,

:formula_6

where signifies the normal-ordered product of the operators and (±) takes care of the possible sign change when commuting the fermionic operators to bring them together for a contraction (a propagator) and represents all possible contractions.

=== Feynman rules ===
The diagrams are drawn according to the Feynman rules, which depend upon the interaction Lagrangian. For the QED interaction Lagrangian
:formula_7
describing the interaction of a fermionic field with a bosonic gauge field , the Feynman rules can be formulated in coordinate space as follows:

* Each integration coordinate is represented by a point (sometimes called a vertex);
* A bosonic propagator is represented by a wiggly line connecting two points;
* A fermionic propagator is represented by a solid line connecting two points;
* A bosonic field formula_8 is represented by a wiggly line attached to the point ;
* A fermionic field is represented by a solid line attached to the point with an arrow toward the point;
* An anti-fermionic field is represented by a solid line attached to the point with an arrow away from the point;

=== Example: second order processes in QED ===
The second order perturbation term in the -matrix is

:formula_9

==== Scattering of fermions ====
The Wick&#x27;s expansion of the integrand gives (among others) the following term

:formula_10

where

:formula_11

is the electromagnetic contraction (propagator) in the Feynman gauge. This term is represented by the Feynman diagram at the right. This diagram gives contributions to the following processes:
# e− e− scattering (initial state at the right, final state at the left of the diagram);
# e+ e+ scattering (initial state at the left, final state at the right of the diagram);
# e− e+ scattering (initial state at the bottom/top, final state at the top/bottom of the diagram).

==== Compton scattering and annihilation/generation of e− e+ pairs ====
Another interesting term in the expansion is

:formula_12

where

:formula_13

is the fermionic contraction (propagator).

== Path integral formulation ==
In a path integral, the field Lagrangian, integrated over all possible field histories, defines the probability amplitude to go from one field configuration to another. In order to make sense, the field theory must have a well-defined ground state, and the integral must be performed a little bit rotated into imaginary time, i.e. a Wick rotation. The path integral formalism is completely equivalent to the canonical operator formalism above.

=== Scalar field Lagrangian ===
A simple example is the free relativistic scalar field in dimensions, whose action integral is:
:formula_14

The probability amplitude for a process is:

:formula_15

where and are space-like hypersurfaces that define the boundary conditions. The collection of all the on the starting hypersurface give the field&#x27;s initial value, analogous to the starting position for a point particle, and the field values at each point of the final hypersurface defines the final field value, which is allowed to vary, giving a different amplitude to end up at different values. This is the field-to-field transition amplitude.

The path integral gives the expectation value of operators between the initial and final state:

:formula_16

and in the limit that A and B recede to the infinite past and the infinite future, the only contribution that matters is from the ground state (this is only rigorously true if the path-integral is defined slightly rotated into imaginary time). The path integral can be thought of as analogous to a probability distribution, and it is convenient to define it so that multiplying by a constant does not change anything:

:formula_17

The field&#x27;s partition function is the normalization factor on the bottom, which coincides with the statistical mechanical partition function at zero temperature when rotated into imaginary time.

The initial-to-final amplitudes are ill-defined if one thinks of the continuum limit right from the beginning, because the fluctuations in the field can become unbounded. So the path-integral can be thought of as on a discrete square lattice, with lattice spacing and the limit should be taken carefully. If the final results do not depend on the shape of the lattice or the value of , then the continuum limit exists.

=== On a lattice ===
On a lattice, (i), the field can be expanded in Fourier modes:
:formula_18

Here the integration domain is over restricted to a cube of side length , so that large values of are not allowed. It is important to note that the -measure contains the factors of 2 from Fourier transforms, this is the best standard convention for -integrals in QFT. The lattice means that fluctuations at large are not allowed to contribute right away, they only start to contribute in the limit . Sometimes, instead of a lattice, the field modes are just cut off at high values of instead.

It is also convenient from time to time to consider the space-time volume to be finite, so that the modes are also a lattice. This is not strictly as necessary as the space-lattice limit, because interactions in are not localized, but it is convenient for keeping track of the factors in front of the -integrals and the momentum-conserving delta functions that will arise.

On a lattice, (ii), the action needs to be discretized:
:formula_19

where is a pair of nearest lattice neighbors and . The discretization should be thought of as defining what the derivative means.

In terms of the lattice Fourier modes, the action can be written:
:formula_20
For near zero this is:
:formula_21

Now we have the continuum Fourier transform of the original action. In finite volume, the quantity is not infinitesimal, but becomes the volume of a box made by neighboring Fourier modes, or .

The field is real-valued, so the Fourier transform obeys:

:formula_22

In terms of real and imaginary parts, the real part of is an even function of , while the imaginary part is odd. The Fourier transform avoids double-counting, so that it can be written:

:formula_23

over an integration domain that integrates over each pair exactly once.

For a complex scalar field with action

:formula_24

the Fourier transform is unconstrained:

:formula_25

and the integral is over all .

Integrating over all different values of is equivalent to integrating over all Fourier modes, because taking a Fourier transform is a unitary linear transformation of field coordinates. When you change coordinates in a multidimensional integral by a linear transformation, the value of the new integral is given by the determinant of the transformation matrix. If
:formula_26

then
:formula_27

If is a rotation, then
:formula_28
so that , and the sign depends on whether the rotation includes a reflection or not.

The matrix that changes coordinates from to can be read off from the definition of a Fourier transform.

:formula_29

and the Fourier inversion theorem tells you the inverse:

:formula_30

which is the complex conjugate-transpose, up to factors of 2. On a finite volume lattice, the determinant is nonzero and independent of the field values.
:formula_31

and the path integral is a separate factor at each value of .

:formula_32

The factor is the infinitesimal volume of a discrete cell in -space, in a square lattice box
:formula_33
where is the side-length of the box. Each separate factor is an oscillatory Gaussian, and the width of the Gaussian diverges as the volume goes to infinity.

In imaginary time, the &quot;Euclidean action&quot; becomes positive definite, and can be interpreted as a probability distribution. The probability of a field having values is
:formula_34

The expectation value of the field is the statistical expectation value of the field when chosen according to the probability distribution:

:formula_35

Since the probability of is a product, the value of at each separate value of is independently Gaussian distributed. The variance of the Gaussian is , which is formally infinite, but that just means that the fluctuations are unbounded in infinite volume. In any finite volume, the integral is replaced by a discrete sum, and the variance of the integral is .

=== Monte Carlo ===
The path integral defines a probabilistic algorithm to generate a Euclidean scalar field configuration. Randomly pick the real and imaginary parts of each Fourier mode at wavenumber to be a Gaussian random variable with variance . This generates a configuration at random, and the Fourier transform gives . For real scalar fields, the algorithm must generate only one of each pair , and make the second the complex conjugate of the first.

To find any correlation function, generate a field again and again by this procedure, and find the statistical average:

:formula_36

where is the number of configurations, and the sum is of the product of the field values on each configuration. The Euclidean correlation function is just the same as the correlation function in statistics or statistical mechanics. The quantum mechanical correlation functions are an analytic continuation of the Euclidean correlation functions.

For free fields with a quadratic action, the probability distribution is a high-dimensional Gaussian, and the statistical average is given by an explicit formula. But the Monte Carlo method also works well for bosonic interacting field theories where there is no closed form for the correlation functions.

=== Scalar propagator ===
Each mode is independently Gaussian distributed. The expectation of field modes is easy to calculate:

:formula_37

for , since then the two Gaussian random variables are independent and both have zero mean.

:formula_38

in finite volume , when the two -values coincide, since this is the variance of the Gaussian. In the infinite volume limit,

:formula_39

Strictly speaking, this is an approximation: the lattice propagator is:

:formula_40

But near , for field fluctuations long compared to the lattice spacing, the two forms coincide.

The delta functions contain factors of 2, so that they cancel out the 2 factors in the measure for integrals.

:formula_41

where is the ordinary one-dimensional Dirac delta function. This convention for delta-functions is not universal—some authors keep the factors of 2 in the delta functions (and in the -integration) explicit.

=== Equation of motion ===
The form of the propagator can be more easily found by using the equation of motion for the field. From the Lagrangian, the equation of motion is:

:formula_42

and in an expectation value, this says:

:formula_43

Where the derivatives act on , and the identity is true everywhere except when and coincide, and the operator order matters. The form of the singularity can be understood from the canonical commutation relations to be a delta-function. Defining the (Euclidean) &quot;Feynman propagator&quot; as the Fourier transform of the time-ordered two-point function (the one that comes from the path-integral):

:formula_44

So that:

:formula_45

If the equations of motion are linear, the propagator will always be the reciprocal of the quadratic-form matrix that defines the free Lagrangian, since this gives the equations of motion. This is also easy to see directly from the path integral. The factor of disappears in the Euclidean theory.

==== Wick theorem ====

Because each field mode is an independent Gaussian, the expectation values for the product of many field modes obeys &quot;Wick&#x27;s theorem&quot;:

:formula_46

is zero unless the field modes coincide in pairs. This means that it is zero for an odd number of , and for an even number of , it is equal to a contribution from each pair separately, with a delta function.

:formula_47

where the sum is over each partition of the field modes into pairs, and the product is over the pairs. For example,

:formula_48

An interpretation of Wick&#x27;s theorem is that each field insertion can be thought of as a dangling line, and the expectation value is calculated by linking up the lines in pairs, putting a delta function factor that ensures that the momentum of each partner in the pair is equal, and dividing by the propagator.

==== Higher Gaussian moments — completing Wick&#x27;s theorem ====
There is a subtle point left before Wick&#x27;s theorem is proved—what if more than two of the formula_49s have the same momentum? If it&#x27;s an odd number, the integral is zero; negative values cancel with the positive values. But if the number is even, the integral is positive. The previous demonstration assumed that the formula_49s would only match up in pairs.

But the theorem is correct even when arbitrarily many of the formula_49 are equal, and this is a notable property of Gaussian integration:
:formula_52
:formula_53

Dividing by ,

:formula_54
:formula_55

If Wick&#x27;s theorem were correct, the higher moments would be given by all possible pairings of a list of different :

:formula_56

where the are all the same variable, the index is just to keep track of the number of ways to pair them. The first can be paired with others, leaving . The next unpaired can be paired with different leaving , and so on. This means that Wick&#x27;s theorem, uncorrected, says that the expectation value of should be:

:formula_57

and this is in fact the correct answer. So Wick&#x27;s theorem holds no matter how many of the momenta of the internal variables coincide.

==== Interaction ====
Interactions are represented by higher order contributions, since quadratic contributions are always Gaussian. The simplest interaction is the quartic self-interaction, with an action:

:formula_58

The reason for the combinatorial factor 4! will be clear soon. Writing the action in terms of the lattice (or continuum) Fourier modes:

:formula_59

Where is the free action, whose correlation functions are given by Wick&#x27;s theorem. The exponential of in the path integral can be expanded in powers of , giving a series of corrections to the free action.

:formula_60

The path integral for the interacting action is then a power series of corrections to the free action. The term represented by should be thought of as four half-lines, one for each factor of . The half-lines meet at a vertex, which contributes a delta-function that ensures that the sum of the momenta are all equal.

To compute a correlation function in the interacting theory, there is a contribution from the terms now. For example, the path-integral for the four-field correlator:

:formula_61

which in the free field was only nonzero when the momenta were equal in pairs, is now nonzero for all values of . The momenta of the insertions can now match up with the momenta of the s in the expansion. The insertions should also be thought of as half-lines, four in this case, which carry a momentum , but one that is not integrated.

The lowest-order contribution comes from the first nontrivial term in the Taylor expansion of the action. Wick&#x27;s theorem requires that the momenta in the half-lines, the factors in , should match up with the momenta of the external half-lines in pairs. The new contribution is equal to:

:formula_62

The 4! inside is canceled because there are exactly 4! ways to match the half-lines in to the external half-lines. Each of these different ways of matching the half-lines together in pairs contributes exactly once, regardless of the values of , by Wick&#x27;s theorem.

==== Feynman diagrams ====
The expansion of the action in powers of gives a series of terms with progressively higher number of s. The contribution from the term with exactly s is called th order.

The th order terms has:
# internal half-lines, which are the factors of from the s. These all end on a vertex, and are integrated over all possible .
# external half-lines, which are the come from the insertions in the integral.

By Wick&#x27;s theorem, each pair of half-lines must be paired together to make a &quot;line&quot;, and this line gives a factor of

:formula_63

which multiplies the contribution. This means that the two half-lines that make a line are forced to have equal and opposite momentum. The line itself should be labelled by an arrow, drawn parallel to the line, and labeled by the momentum in the line . The half-line at the tail end of the arrow carries momentum , while the half-line at the head-end carries momentum . If one of the two half-lines is external, this kills the integral over the internal , since it forces the internal to be equal to the external . If both are internal, the integral over remains.

The diagrams that are formed by linking the half-lines in the s with the external half-lines, representing insertions, are the Feynman diagrams of this theory. Each line carries a factor of , the propagator, and either goes from vertex to vertex, or ends at an insertion. If it is internal, it is integrated over. At each vertex, the total incoming is equal to the total outgoing .

The number of ways of making a diagram by joining half-lines into lines almost completely cancels the factorial factors coming from the Taylor series of the exponential and the 4! at each vertex.

==== Loop order ====
A forest diagram is one where all the internal lines have momentum that is completely determined by the external lines and the condition that the incoming and outgoing momentum are equal at each vertex. The contribution of these diagrams is a product of propagators, without any integration. A tree diagram is a connected forest diagram.

An example of a tree diagram is the one where each of four external lines end on an . Another is when three external lines end on an , and the remaining half-line joins up with another , and the remaining half-lines of this run off to external lines. These are all also forest diagrams (as every tree is a forest); an example of a forest that is not a tree is when eight external lines end on two s.

It is easy to verify that in all these cases, the momenta on all the internal lines is determined by the external momenta and the condition of momentum conservation in each vertex.

A diagram that is not a forest diagram is called a &quot;loop&quot; diagram, and an example is one where two lines of an are joined to external lines, while the remaining two lines are joined to each other. The two lines joined to each other can have any momentum at all, since they both enter and leave the same vertex. A more complicated example is one where two s are joined to each other by matching the legs one to the other. This diagram has no external lines at all.

The reason loop diagrams are called loop diagrams is because the number of -integrals that are left undetermined by momentum conservation is equal to the number of independent closed loops in the diagram, where independent loops are counted as in homology theory. The homology is real-valued (actually valued), the value associated with each line is the momentum. The boundary operator takes each line to the sum of the end-vertices with a positive sign at the head and a negative sign at the tail. The condition that the momentum is conserved is exactly the condition that the boundary of the -valued weighted graph is zero.

A set of valid -values can be arbitrarily redefined whenever there is a closed loop. A closed loop is a cyclical path of adjacent vertices that never revisits the same vertex. Such a cycle can be thought of as the boundary of a hypothetical 2-cell. The -labellings of a graph that conserve momentum (i.e. which has zero boundary) up to redefinitions of (i.e. up to boundaries of 2-cells) define the first homology of a graph. The number of independent momenta that are not determined is then equal to the number of independent homology loops. For many graphs, this is equal to the number of loops as counted in the most intuitive way.

==== Symmetry factors ====
The number of ways to form a given Feynman diagram by joining half-lines is large, and by Wick&#x27;s theorem, each way of pairing up the half-lines contributes equally. Often, this completely cancels the factorials in the denominator of each term, but the cancellation is sometimes incomplete.

The uncancelled denominator is called the &quot;symmetry factor&quot; of the diagram. The contribution of each diagram to the correlation function must be divided by its symmetry factor.

For example, consider the Feynman diagram formed from two external lines joined to one , and the remaining two half-lines in the joined to each other. There are 4 × 3 ways to join the external half-lines to the , and then there is only one way to join the two remaining lines to each other. The comes divided by , but the number of ways to link up the half lines to make the diagram is only 4 × 3, so the contribution of this diagram is divided by two.

For another example, consider the diagram formed by joining all the half-lines of one to all the half-lines of another . This diagram is called a &quot;vacuum bubble&quot;, because it does not link up to any external lines. There are 4! ways to form this diagram, but the denominator includes a 2! (from the expansion of the exponential, there are two s) and two factors of 4!. The contribution is multiplied by = .

Another example is the Feynman diagram formed from two s where each links up to two external lines, and the remaining two half-lines of each are joined to each other. The number of ways to link an to two external lines is 4 × 3, and either could link up to either pair, giving an additional factor of 2. The remaining two half-lines in the two s can be linked to each other in two ways, so that the total number of ways to form the diagram is , while the denominator is . The total symmetry factor is 2, and the contribution of this diagram is divided by 2.

The symmetry factor theorem gives the symmetry factor for a general diagram: the contribution of each Feynman diagram must be divided by the order of its group of automorphisms, the number of symmetries that it has.

An automorphism of a Feynman graph is a permutation of the lines and a permutation of the vertices with the following properties:

# If a line goes from vertex to vertex , then goes from to . If the line is undirected, as it is for a real scalar field, then can go from to too.
# If a line ends on an external line, ends on the same external line.
# If there are different types of lines, should preserve the type.

This theorem has an interpretation in terms of particle-paths: when identical particles are present, the integral over all intermediate particles must not double-count states that differ only by interchanging identical particles.

Proof: To prove this theorem, label all the internal and external lines of a diagram with a unique name. Then form the diagram by linking a half-line to a name and then to the other half line.

Now count the number of ways to form the named diagram. Each permutation of the s gives a different pattern of linking names to half-lines, and this is a factor of . Each permutation of the half-lines in a single gives a factor of 4!. So a named diagram can be formed in exactly as many ways as the denominator of the Feynman expansion.

But the number of unnamed diagrams is smaller than the number of named diagram by the order of the automorphism group of the graph.

==== Connected diagrams: &quot;linked-cluster theorem&quot; ====
Roughly speaking, a Feynman diagram is called &quot;connected&quot; if all vertices and propagator lines are linked by a sequence of vertices and propagators of the diagram itself. If one views it as an undirected graph it is connected. The remarkable relevance of such diagrams in QFTs is due to the fact that they are sufficient to determine the quantum partition function . More precisely, connected Feynman diagrams determine

:formula_64

To see this, one should recall that

:formula_65

with constructed from some (arbitrary) Feynman diagram that can be thought to consist of several connected components . If one encounters (identical) copies of a component within the Feynman diagram one has to include a &quot;symmetry factor&quot; . However, in the end each contribution of a Feynman diagram to the partition function has the generic form

:formula_66

where labels the (infinitely) many connected Feynman diagrams possible.

A scheme to successively create such contributions from the to is obtained by

:formula_67

and therefore yields

:formula_68

To establish the &quot;normalization&quot; one simply calculates all connected &quot;vacuum diagrams&quot;, i.e., the diagrams without any &quot;sources&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;external legs&quot; of a Feynman diagram).

The linked-cluster theorem was first proved to order four by Keith Brueckner in 1955, and for infinite orders by Jeffrey Goldstone in 1957.

==== Vacuum bubbles ====
An immediate consequence of the linked-cluster theorem is that all vacuum bubbles, diagrams without external lines, cancel when calculating correlation functions. A correlation function is given by a ratio of path-integrals:

:formula_69

The top is the sum over all Feynman diagrams, including disconnected diagrams that do not link up to external lines at all. In terms of the connected diagrams, the numerator includes the same contributions of vacuum bubbles as the denominator:

:formula_70

Where the sum over diagrams includes only those diagrams each of whose connected components end on at least one external line. The vacuum bubbles are the same whatever the external lines, and give an overall multiplicative factor. The denominator is the sum over all vacuum bubbles, and dividing gets rid of the second factor.

The vacuum bubbles then are only useful for determining itself, which from the definition of the path integral is equal to:

:formula_71

where is the energy density in the vacuum. Each vacuum bubble contains a factor of zeroing the total at each vertex, and when there are no external lines, this contains a factor of , because the momentum conservation is over-enforced. In finite volume, this factor can be identified as the total volume of space time. Dividing by the volume, the remaining integral for the vacuum bubble has an interpretation: it is a contribution to the energy density of the vacuum.

==== Sources ====
Correlation functions are the sum of the connected Feynman diagrams, but the formalism treats the connected and disconnected diagrams differently. Internal lines end on vertices, while external lines go off to insertions. Introducing &quot;sources&quot; unifies the formalism, by making new vertices where one line can end.

Sources are external fields, fields that contribute to the action, but are not dynamical variables. A scalar field source is another scalar field that contributes a term to the (Lorentz) Lagrangian:

:formula_72

In the Feynman expansion, this contributes H terms with one half-line ending on a vertex. Lines in a Feynman diagram can now end either on an vertex, or on an vertex, and only one line enters an vertex. The Feynman rule for an vertex is that a line from an with momentum gets a factor of .

The sum of the connected diagrams in the presence of sources includes a term for each connected diagram in the absence of sources, except now the diagrams can end on the source. Traditionally, a source is represented by a little &quot;×&quot; with one line extending out, exactly as an insertion.

:formula_73

where is the connected diagram with external lines carrying momentum as indicated. The sum is over all connected diagrams, as before.

The field is not dynamical, which means that there is no path integral over : is just a parameter in the Lagrangian, which varies from point to point. The path integral for the field is:

:formula_74

and it is a function of the values of at every point. One way to interpret this expression is that it is taking the Fourier transform in field space. If there is a probability density on , the Fourier transform of the probability density is:

:formula_75

The Fourier transform is the expectation of an oscillatory exponential. The path integral in the presence of a source is:

:formula_76

which, on a lattice, is the product of an oscillatory exponential for each field value:

:formula_77

The Fourier transform of a delta-function is a constant, which gives a formal expression for a delta function:

:formula_78

This tells you what a field delta function looks like in a path-integral. For two scalar fields and ,

:formula_79

which integrates over the Fourier transform coordinate, over . This expression is useful for formally changing field coordinates in the path integral, much as a delta function is used to change coordinates in an ordinary multi-dimensional integral.

The partition function is now a function of the field , and the physical partition function is the value when is the zero function:

The correlation functions are derivatives of the path integral with respect to the source:

:formula_80

In Euclidean space, source contributions to the action can still appear with a factor of , so that they still do a Fourier transform.

=== Spin ; &quot;photons&quot; and &quot;ghosts&quot; ===

==== Spin : Grassmann integrals ====
The field path integral can be extended to the Fermi case, but only if the notion of integration is expanded. A Grassmann integral of a free Fermi field is a high-dimensional determinant or Pfaffian, which defines the new type of Gaussian integration appropriate for Fermi fields.

The two fundamental formulas of Grassmann integration are:

:formula_81

where is an arbitrary matrix and are independent Grassmann variables for each index , and

:formula_82

where is an antisymmetric matrix, is a collection of Grassmann variables, and the is to prevent double-counting (since ).

In matrix notation, where and are Grassmann-valued row vectors, and are Grassmann-valued column vectors, and is a real-valued matrix:

:formula_83

where the last equality is a consequence of the translation invariance of the Grassmann integral. The Grassmann variables are external sources for , and differentiating with respect to pulls down factors of .

:formula_84

again, in a schematic matrix notation. The meaning of the formula above is that the derivative with respect to the appropriate component of and gives the matrix element of . This is exactly analogous to the bosonic path integration formula for a Gaussian integral of a complex bosonic field:

:formula_85
:formula_86

So that the propagator is the inverse of the matrix in the quadratic part of the action in both the Bose and Fermi case.

For real Grassmann fields, for Majorana fermions, the path integral is a Pfaffian times a source quadratic form, and the formulas give the square root of the determinant, just as they do for real Bosonic fields. The propagator is still the inverse of the quadratic part.

The free Dirac Lagrangian:

:formula_87

formally gives the equations of motion and the anticommutation relations of the Dirac field, just as the Klein Gordon Lagrangian in an ordinary path integral gives the equations of motion and commutation relations of the scalar field. By using the spatial Fourier transform of the Dirac field as a new basis for the Grassmann algebra, the quadratic part of the Dirac action becomes simple to invert:

:formula_88

The propagator is the inverse of the matrix linking and , since different values of do not mix together.

:formula_89

The analog of Wick&#x27;s theorem matches and in pairs:

:formula_90

where S is the sign of the permutation that reorders the sequence of and to put the ones that are paired up to make the delta-functions next to each other, with the coming right before the . Since a pair is a commuting element of the Grassmann algebra, it does not matter what order the pairs are in. If more than one pair have the same , the integral is zero, and it is easy to check that the sum over pairings gives zero in this case (there are always an even number of them). This is the Grassmann analog of the higher Gaussian moments that completed the Bosonic Wick&#x27;s theorem earlier.

The rules for spin- Dirac particles are as follows: The propagator is the inverse of the Dirac operator, the lines have arrows just as for a complex scalar field, and the diagram acquires an overall factor of −1 for each closed Fermi loop. If there are an odd number of Fermi loops, the diagram changes sign. Historically, the −1 rule was very difficult for Feynman to discover. He discovered it after a long process of trial and error, since he lacked a proper theory of Grassmann integration.

The rule follows from the observation that the number of Fermi lines at a vertex is always even. Each term in the Lagrangian must always be Bosonic. A Fermi loop is counted by following Fermionic lines until one comes back to the starting point, then removing those lines from the diagram. Repeating this process eventually erases all the Fermionic lines: this is the Euler algorithm to 2-color a graph, which works whenever each vertex has even degree. The number of steps in the Euler algorithm is only equal to the number of independent Fermionic homology cycles in the common special case that all terms in the Lagrangian are exactly quadratic in the Fermi fields, so that each vertex has exactly two Fermionic lines. When there are four-Fermi interactions (like in the Fermi effective theory of the weak nuclear interactions) there are more -integrals than Fermi loops. In this case, the counting rule should apply the Euler algorithm by pairing up the Fermi lines at each vertex into pairs that together form a bosonic factor of the term in the Lagrangian, and when entering a vertex by one line, the algorithm should always leave with the partner line.

To clarify and prove the rule, consider a Feynman diagram formed from vertices, terms in the Lagrangian, with Fermion fields. The full term is Bosonic, it is a commuting element of the Grassmann algebra, so the order in which the vertices appear is not important. The Fermi lines are linked into loops, and when traversing the loop, one can reorder the vertex terms one after the other as one goes around without any sign cost. The exception is when you return to the starting point, and the final half-line must be joined with the unlinked first half-line. This requires one permutation to move the last to go in front of the first , and this gives the sign.

This rule is the only visible effect of the exclusion principle in internal lines. When there are external lines, the amplitudes are antisymmetric when two Fermi insertions for identical particles are interchanged. This is automatic in the source formalism, because the sources for Fermi fields are themselves Grassmann valued.

==== Spin 1: photons ====
The naive propagator for photons is infinite, since the Lagrangian for the A-field is:

:formula_91

The quadratic form defining the propagator is non-invertible. The reason is the gauge invariance of the field; adding a gradient to does not change the physics.

To fix this problem, one needs to fix a gauge. The most convenient way is to demand that the divergence of is some function , whose value is random from point to point. It does no harm to integrate over the values of , since it only determines the choice of gauge. This procedure inserts the following factor into the path integral for :

:formula_92

The first factor, the delta function, fixes the gauge. The second factor sums over different values of that are inequivalent gauge fixings. This is simply

:formula_93

The additional contribution from gauge-fixing cancels the second half of the free Lagrangian, giving the Feynman Lagrangian:

:formula_94

which is just like four independent free scalar fields, one for each component of . The Feynman propagator is:

:formula_95

The one difference is that the sign of one propagator is wrong in the Lorentz case: the timelike component has an opposite sign propagator. This means that these particle states have negative norm—they are not physical states. In the case of photons, it is easy to show by diagram methods that these states are not physical—their contribution cancels with longitudinal photons to only leave two physical photon polarization contributions for any value of .

If the averaging over is done with a coefficient different from , the two terms do not cancel completely. This gives a covariant Lagrangian with a coefficient formula_96, which does not affect anything:

:formula_97

and the covariant propagator for QED is:

:formula_98

==== Spin 1: non-Abelian ghosts ====
To find the Feynman rules for non-Abelian gauge fields, the procedure that performs the gauge fixing must be carefully corrected to account for a change of variables in the path-integral.

The gauge fixing factor has an extra determinant from popping the delta function:

:formula_99

To find the form of the determinant, consider first a simple two-dimensional integral of a function that depends only on , not on the angle . Inserting an integral over :

:formula_100

The derivative-factor ensures that popping the delta function in removes the integral. Exchanging the order of integration,

:formula_101

but now the delta-function can be popped in ,

:formula_102

The integral over just gives an overall factor of 2, while the rate of change of with a change in is just , so this exercise reproduces the standard formula for polar integration of a radial function:

:formula_103

In the path-integral for a nonabelian gauge field, the analogous manipulation is:

:formula_104

The factor in front is the volume of the gauge group, and it contributes a constant, which can be discarded. The remaining integral is over the gauge fixed action.

:formula_105

To get a covariant gauge, the gauge fixing condition is the same as in the Abelian case:

:formula_106

Whose variation under an infinitesimal gauge transformation is given by:

:formula_107

where is the adjoint valued element of the Lie algebra at every point that performs the infinitesimal gauge transformation. This adds the Faddeev Popov determinant to the action:

:formula_108

which can be rewritten as a Grassmann integral by introducing ghost fields:

:formula_109

The determinant is independent of , so the path-integral over can give the Feynman propagator (or a covariant propagator) by choosing the measure for as in the abelian case. The full gauge fixed action is then the Yang Mills action in Feynman gauge with an additional ghost action:

:formula_110

The diagrams are derived from this action. The propagator for the spin-1 fields has the usual Feynman form. There are vertices of degree 3 with momentum factors whose couplings are the structure constants, and vertices of degree 4 whose couplings are products of structure constants. There are additional ghost loops, which cancel out timelike and longitudinal states in loops.

In the Abelian case, the determinant for covariant gauges does not depend on , so the ghosts do not contribute to the connected diagrams.

== Particle-path representation ==
Feynman diagrams were originally discovered by Feynman, by trial and error, as a way to represent the contribution to the S-matrix from different classes of particle trajectories.

=== Schwinger representation ===
The Euclidean scalar propagator has a suggestive representation:

:formula_111

The meaning of this identity (which is an elementary integration) is made clearer by Fourier transforming to real space.

:formula_112

The contribution at any one value of to the propagator is a Gaussian of width . The total propagation function from 0 to is a weighted sum over all proper times of a normalized Gaussian, the probability of ending up at after a random walk of time .

The path-integral representation for the propagator is then:

:formula_113

which is a path-integral rewrite of the Schwinger representation.

The Schwinger representation is both useful for making manifest the particle aspect of the propagator, and for symmetrizing denominators of loop diagrams.

=== Combining denominators ===
The Schwinger representation has an immediate practical application to loop diagrams. For example, for the diagram in the theory formed by joining two s together in two half-lines, and making the remaining lines external, the integral over the internal propagators in the loop is:

: formula_114

Here one line carries momentum and the other . The asymmetry can be fixed by putting everything in the Schwinger representation.

:formula_115

Now the exponent mostly depends on ,

:formula_116

except for the asymmetrical little bit. Defining the variable and , the variable goes from 0 to , while goes from 0 to 1. The variable is the total proper time for the loop, while parametrizes the fraction of the proper time on the top of the loop versus the bottom.

The Jacobian for this transformation of variables is easy to work out from the identities:

:formula_117

and &quot;wedging&quot; gives

:formula_118.

This allows the integral to be evaluated explicitly:

:formula_119

leaving only the -integral. This method, invented by Schwinger but usually attributed to Feynman, is called &quot;combining denominator&quot;. Abstractly, it is the elementary identity:

:formula_120

But this form does not provide the physical motivation for introducing ; is the proportion of proper time on one of the legs of the loop.

Once the denominators are combined, a shift in to symmetrizes everything:

:formula_121

This form shows that the moment that is more negative than four times the mass of the particle in the loop, which happens in a physical region of Lorentz space, the integral has a cut. This is exactly when the external momentum can create physical particles.

When the loop has more vertices, there are more denominators to combine:

:formula_122

The general rule follows from the Schwinger prescription for denominators:

:formula_123

The integral over the Schwinger parameters can be split up as before into an integral over the total proper time and an integral over the fraction of the proper time in all but the first segment of the loop for . The are positive and add up to less than 1, so that the integral is over an -dimensional simplex.

The Jacobian for the coordinate transformation can be worked out as before:

:formula_124
:formula_125

Wedging all these equations together, one obtains

:formula_126

This gives the integral:

:formula_127

where the simplex is the region defined by the conditions
:formula_128
as well as
:formula_129
Performing the integral gives the general prescription for combining denominators:

:formula_130

Since the numerator of the integrand is not involved, the same prescription works for any loop, no matter what the spins are carried by the legs. The interpretation of the parameters is that they are the fraction of the total proper time spent on each leg.

=== Scattering ===
The correlation functions of a quantum field theory describe the scattering of particles. The definition of &quot;particle&quot; in relativistic field theory is not self-evident, because if you try to determine the position so that the uncertainty is less than the compton wavelength, the uncertainty in energy is large enough to produce more particles and antiparticles of the same type from the vacuum. This means that the notion of a single-particle state is to some extent incompatible with the notion of an object localized in space.

In the 1930s, Wigner gave a mathematical definition for single-particle states: they are a collection of states that form an irreducible representation of the Poincaré group. Single particle states describe an object with a finite mass, a well defined momentum, and a spin. This definition is fine for protons and neutrons, electrons and photons, but it excludes quarks, which are permanently confined, so the modern point of view is more accommodating: a particle is anything whose interaction can be described in terms of Feynman diagrams, which have an interpretation as a sum over particle trajectories.

A field operator can act to produce a one-particle state from the vacuum, which means that the field operator produces a superposition of Wigner particle states. In the free field theory, the field produces one particle states only. But when there are interactions, the field operator can also produce 3-particle, 5-particle (if there is no +/− symmetry also 2, 4, 6 particle) states too. To compute the scattering amplitude for single particle states only requires a careful limit, sending the fields to infinity and integrating over space to get rid of the higher-order corrections.

The relation between scattering and correlation functions is the LSZ-theorem: The scattering amplitude for particles to go to particles in a scattering event is the given by the sum of the Feynman diagrams that go into the correlation function for field insertions, leaving out the propagators for the external legs.

For example, for the interaction of the previous section, the order contribution to the (Lorentz) correlation function is:

:formula_131

Stripping off the external propagators, that is, removing the factors of , gives the invariant scattering amplitude :

:formula_132

which is a constant, independent of the incoming and outgoing momentum. The interpretation of the scattering amplitude is that the sum of over all possible final states is the probability for the scattering event. The normalization of the single-particle states must be chosen carefully, however, to ensure that is a relativistic invariant.

Non-relativistic single particle states are labeled by the momentum , and they are chosen to have the same norm at every value of . This is because the nonrelativistic unit operator on single particle states is:

:formula_133

In relativity, the integral over the -states for a particle of mass m integrates over a hyperbola in space defined by the energy–momentum relation:

:formula_134

If the integral weighs each point equally, the measure is not Lorentz-invariant. The invariant measure integrates over all values of and , restricting to the hyperbola with a Lorentz-invariant delta function:

:formula_135

So the normalized -states are different from the relativistically normalized -states by a factor of
:formula_136

The invariant amplitude is then the probability amplitude for relativistically normalized incoming states to become relativistically normalized outgoing states.

For nonrelativistic values of , the relativistic normalization is the same as the nonrelativistic normalization (up to a constant factor ). In this limit, the invariant scattering amplitude is still constant. The particles created by the field scatter in all directions with equal amplitude.

The nonrelativistic potential, which scatters in all directions with an equal amplitude (in the Born approximation), is one whose Fourier transform is constant—a delta-function potential. The lowest order scattering of the theory reveals the non-relativistic interpretation of this theory—it describes a collection of particles with a delta-function repulsion. Two such particles have an aversion to occupying the same point at the same time.

== Nonperturbative effects ==
Thinking of Feynman diagrams as a perturbation series, nonperturbative effects like tunneling do not show up, because any effect that goes to zero faster than any polynomial does not affect the Taylor series. Even bound states are absent, since at any finite order particles are only exchanged a finite number of times, and to make a bound state, the binding force must last forever.

But this point of view is misleading, because the diagrams not only describe scattering, but they also are a representation of the short-distance field theory correlations. They encode not only asymptotic processes like particle scattering, they also describe the multiplication rules for fields, the operator product expansion. Nonperturbative tunneling processes involve field configurations that on average get big when the coupling constant gets small, but each configuration is a coherent superposition of particles whose local interactions are described by Feynman diagrams. When the coupling is small, these become collective processes that involve large numbers of particles, but where the interactions between each of the particles is simple. (The perturbation series of any interacting quantum field theory has zero radius of convergence, complicating the limit of the infinite series of diagrams needed (in the limit of vanishing coupling) to describe such field configurations.)

This means that nonperturbative effects show up asymptotically in resummations of infinite classes of diagrams, and these diagrams can be locally simple. The graphs determine the local equations of motion, while the allowed large-scale configurations describe non-perturbative physics. But because Feynman propagators are nonlocal in time, translating a field process to a coherent particle language is not completely intuitive, and has only been explicitly worked out in certain special cases. In the case of nonrelativistic bound states, the Bethe–Salpeter equation describes the class of diagrams to include to describe a relativistic atom. For quantum chromodynamics, the Shifman–Vainshtein–Zakharov sum rules describe non-perturbatively excited long-wavelength field modes in particle language, but only in a phenomenological way.

The number of Feynman diagrams at high orders of perturbation theory is very large, because there are as many diagrams as there are graphs with a given number of nodes. Nonperturbative effects leave a signature on the way in which the number of diagrams and resummations diverge at high order. It is only because non-perturbative effects appear in hidden form in diagrams that it was possible to analyze nonperturbative effects in string theory, where in many cases a Feynman description is the only one available.

<text>Food writing is a literary genre that focuses on the cultural and historical significance of food. It encompasses various forms, including recipes, journalism, memoirs, and travelogues, and can be found in both fiction and non-fiction works. Food writers explore food and its overlap with agriculture, ecology, culture, politics, and personal memories.

Food writing is not limited to communicating information about food but often aims to offer an aesthetic experience. M. F. K. Fisher, a famous American food writer, described her work as an exploration of hunger, love, and the satisfaction of basic human needs. Another American food writer, Adam Gopnik, divides food writing into two categories: the &quot;mock epic,&quot; which humorously elevates the subject of food, and the &quot;mystical microcosmic,&quot; which poetically delves into the deeper meanings of food experiences.

Food writing emerged as a recognized term in the 1990s and includes historical works that have shaped its meaning, such as Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin&#x27;s &quot;The Physiology of Taste.&quot; The field includes food criticism, food journalism, and food history. Food journalism, in particular, has evolved to address broader issues like climate change and public health, expanding beyond traditional food criticism.

==Definition==
Food writers regard food as a substance and a cultural phenomenon. John T. Edge, an American food writer, explains how writers in the genre view its topic: Food is essential to life. It&#x27;s arguably our nation&#x27;s biggest industry. Food, not sex, is our most frequently indulged pleasure. Food—too much, not enough, the wrong kind, the wrong frequency—is one of our society&#x27;s greatest causes of disease and death. Another American food writer, Mark Kurlansky, links this vision of food directly to food writing, giving the genre&#x27;s scope and range when he observes: Food is about agriculture, about ecology, about man&#x27;s relationship with nature, about the climate, about nation-building, cultural struggles, friends and enemies, alliances, wars, religion. It is about memory and tradition and, at times, even about sex.Because food writing is topic centered, it is not a genre in itself, but a writing that uses a wide range of traditional genres, including recipes, journalism, memoir, and travelogues. Food writing can refer to poetry and fiction, such as Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot; (&quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;), with its famous passage where the narrator recollects his childhood memories as a result of sipping tea and eating a madeleine; or Robert Burns&#x27; poem &quot;Address to a Haggis&quot;, 1787. Charles Dickens, a notable novelist wrote memorably about food, e.g., in his &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1843).

Often, food writing is used to specify writing that takes a more literary approach to food, such as that of the famous American food writer M. F. K. Fisher, who describes her writing about food as follows:

It seems to me our three basic needs, for food and security and love, are so mixed and mingled and entwined that we cannot straightly think of one without the others. So it happens that when I write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, and warmth and the love of it and the hunger for it ... and then the warmth and richness and fine reality of hunger satisfied ... and it is all one.

In this literary sense, food writing aspires toward more than merely communicating information about food; it also aims to provide readers with an aesthetic experience. Another American food writer, Adam Gopnik, divides food writing into two categories, &quot;the mock epic and the mystical microcosmic,&quot; and provides examples of their most noted practitioners: 

The mock epic (A. J. Liebling, Calvin Trillin, the French writer Robert Courtine, and any good restaurant critic) is essentially comic and treats the small ambitions of the greedy eater as though they were big and noble, spoofing the idea of the heroic while raising the minor subject to at least temporary greatness. The mystical microcosmic, of which Elizabeth David and M. F. K. Fisher are the masters, is essentially poetic, and turns every remembered recipe into a meditation on hunger and the transience of its fulfillment. Contemporary food writers working in this mode include Ruth Reichl, Betty MacDonald, and Jim Harrison.

As a term, &quot;food writing&quot; is a relatively new descriptor. It came into wide use in the 1990s and, unlike &quot;sports writing&quot;, or &quot;nature writing&quot;, it has yet to be included in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. Consequently, definitions of food writing when applied to historical works are retrospective. Classics of food writing, such as the 18th century French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin&#x27;s &quot;La physiologie du goût&quot; (&quot;The Physiology of Taste&quot;), pre-date the term and have helped to shape its meaning.

== History ==
People have been writing about food for centuries. Some of the earliest recipes we have found were carved into stone in Mesopotamia nearly 4,000 years ago. The ancient Romans also wrote about their grand feasts and fancy meals held by emperors of the time. Although the modern cookbook like we see today was not invented until much later and measurements were not standardized until the 20th century.

==In academia==
Food writer Michael Pollan holds the Knight Professorship of Science and Environmental Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley and since 2013 has directed the 11th Hour Food and Farming Journalism Fellowship Program.

In 2013, the University of South Florida St. Petersburg began a graduate certificate program in Food Writing and Photography, created by longtime &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; food and travel editor Janet K. Keeler.

<doc id="11621" wikidata="Q5510594" url="?curid=11621" title="Futurama (New York World's Fair)">
<text>Futurama was an exhibit and ride at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair designed by Norman Bel Geddes, which presented a possible model of the world 20 years into the future (1959–1960). The installation was sponsored by the General Motors Corporation and was characterized by automated highways and vast suburbs.

==Background==
Geddes had built a model city for a Shell Oil advertising campaign in 1937 that was described as the Shell Oil City of Tomorrow and was effectively a prototype for the much larger and more ambitious Futurama.

==Overview==
Geddes&#x27; &quot;vision of the future&quot; was rather achievable; the most advanced technology posited was the automated highway system of which General Motors built a working prototype by 1960. Futurama is widely held to have first introduced the general American public to the concept of a network of expressways connecting the nation. It provided a direct connection between the streamlined style which was popular in America at the time, and the concept of steady-flow which appeared in street and highway design in the same period.

Geddes expounds upon his design in his book &quot;Magic Motorways&quot;:
The modeled highway construction emphasized hope for the future as it served as a proposed solution to traffic congestion of the day, and demonstrated the probable development of traffic in proportion to the automotive growth of the next 20 years. Bel Geddes assumed that the automobile would be the same type of carrier and still the most common means of transportation in 1960, albeit with increased vehicle use and traffic lanes also capable of much higher speeds.

Four general ideas for improvement were incorporated into the exhibition showcase to meet these assumptions. First, each section of road was designed to receive greater capacity of traffic. Second, traffic moving in one direction could be isolated from traffic moving in any other. Third, segregating traffic by subdividing towns and cities into certain units restricted traffic and allowed pedestrians to predominate. And fourth, traffic control included maximum and minimum speeds. Through this, the exhibition was designed to inspire greater public enthusiasm and support for the constructive work and planning of streets and highways.

The popularity of the Futurama exhibit fit closely with the fair&#x27;s overall theme of &quot;The World of Tomorrow&quot; in its emphasis on the future and its redesign of the American landscape. The highway system was supported within a animated model of a projected America containing more than 500,000 individually designed buildings, a million trees of 13 different species, and approximately 50,000 cars, 10,000 of which traveled along a 14-lane multi-speed interstate highway. It prophesied an American utopia regulated by an assortment of cutting-edge technologies: multi-lane highways with remote-controlled semi-automated vehicles (according to Geddes&#x27; &quot;Magic Motorways&quot;, these vehicles are supposed to be equipped with lane centering and lane change/blind spot assist systems), power plants, farms for artificially produced crops, rooftop platforms for individual flying machines, and various gadgets, all intended to make an ideal built environment and ultimately to reform society.

Geddes&#x27; &quot;future&quot; was synonymous with technological progress in its simulated low-flying airplane journey through the exhibit. The aerial journey was simulated by an 18-minute ride on a conveyor system, carrying 552 seated spectators at a time, covering a ⅓-mile winding path through the model, along with light, sound, and color effects. The ride moved at a rate of approximately per minute or , allowing spectators to look down through a continuous curved pane of glass towards the model. The virtue of this elevated position allowed spectators to see multiple scales simultaneously, viewing city blocks in proportion to a highway system, as well as artificially controlled trees in glass domes. This scale was modeled off 408 topographical sections based on aerial photographs of different regions of the U.S. provided by Fairchild Aircraft Ltd.

==Reception==
Before General Motors invited Bel Geddes to submit a proposal for the exhibit, they had planned to put in another production line as was featured at their exhibit in the Century of Progress Exposition of 1933 in Chicago. However, after they heard Bel Geddes outline his project all other plans were scrapped as they favored his design for its appeal to a broader audience. The Futurama exhibition was subsequently presented as one of the 1939 New York World Fair&#x27;s main attractions, as it was the &quot;number-one hit show&quot;. It was considered highly interesting by the public and critics alike, with journalists competing to find adequate words to convey Bel Geddes&#x27; &quot;ingenuity&quot;, &quot;daring&quot;, &quot;showmanship&quot; and &quot;genius&quot;. One neutral survey of 1000 departing fairgoers awarded the General Motors exhibit 39.4 points to only 8.5 points for second place Ford as the most interesting exhibit. &quot;Business Week&quot; described the scene:
His ideas of the future were considered to have a remarkable degree of realism and immediacy, especially for an American audience slowly recovering from the Great Depression and that was longing for prosperity. Futurama&#x27;s imaginary landscape of 1960 was, at the time, seen not just as a novel physical space, but as a glimpse of the future.

==Legacy==
Multiple Federal-Aid Highway Act bills of legislation, which led to the Interstate Highway System, were influenced by massive attendance at Futurama that helped to popularize the concept of modern interstate highways.

The General Motors pavilion at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair included a ride, Futurama II, that was also known as &quot;The New Futurama&quot;.

The 1964 version had a 110 foot tall front facade which was tilted toward the viewer as they approached the front of the building. Inside, moving theater seats took visitors on a multi-media ride into the future around the world, narrated by a description of all the future scenarios. After the 15 minute ride, visitors exited into a showroom of futuristic models and current General Motors products.

The October 1965 attendance statistics beat the old record from 1939 for the two-year period by about five million visitors, the largest ever attendance of any exhibit at any fair in the world.

It is the namesake of the show &quot;Futurama&quot;.

<doc id="11623" wikidata="Q310536" url="?curid=11623" title="Francesco I Sforza">
<text>Francesco I Sforza (; 23 July 1401 – 8 March 1466) was an Italian condottiero who founded the Sforza dynasty in the duchy of Milan, ruling as its (fourth) duke from 1450 until his death.

In the 1420s, he participated in the War of L&#x27;Aquila and in the 1430s fought for the Papal States and Milan against Venice. Once the war between Milan and Venice ended in 1441 under mediation by Sforza, he successfully invaded southern Italy alongside René of Anjou, pretender to the throne of Naples, and after that returned to Milan. He was instrumental in the Treaty of Lodi (1454) which ensured peace in the Italian realms for a time by ensuring a strategic balance of power. He died in 1466 and was succeeded as duke by his son, Galeazzo Maria Sforza. While Sforza was recognized as duke of Milan, his son Ludovico would be the first to have formal investiture under the Holy Roman Empire by Maximilian I in 1494.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Francesco Sforza was born in Cigoli, near San Miniato, Tuscany, one of the seven illegitimate sons of the condottiero Muzio Sforza and Lucia de Martini. He was the brother of Alessandro Sforza. He spent his childhood in Tricarico (in the modern Basilicata), the marquisate of which he was granted in 1412 by King Ladislaus of Naples. In 1418, he married Polissena Ruffo, a Calabrese noblewoman.

From 1419, he fought alongside his father, soon gaining fame for being able to bend metal bars with his bare hands. He later proved himself to be an expert tactician and a very skilled field commander. After the death of his father during the War of L&#x27;Aquila, he participated in Braccio da Montone&#x27;s final defeat in that campaign; he fought subsequently for the Neapolitan army and then for Pope Martin V and the Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti. After some successes, he fell in disgrace and was sent to the castle of Mortara as a prisoner. He regained his status after leading an expedition against Lucca.

In 1431, after fighting again for the Papal States, he led the Milanese army against Venice; the following year the duke&#x27;s daughter, Bianca Maria, was betrothed to him. Despite these moves, the wary Filippo Maria never ceased to be distrustful of Sforza. The allegiance of mercenary leaders was dependent, of course, on pay; in 1433–1435, Sforza led the Milanese attack on the Papal States, but when he conquered Ancona, in Marche, he changed sides, obtaining the title of vicar of the city directly from Pope Eugene IV. In 1436–39, he served variously both in Florence and Venice.

In 1440, his fiefs in the Kingdom of Naples were occupied by King Alfonso I, and, to recover the situation, Sforza reconciled himself with Filippo Visconti. On 25 October 1441, in Cremona, he could finally marry Bianca Maria as part of the agreements that ended the war between Milan and Venice. The following year, he allied with René of Anjou, pretender to the throne of Naples, and marched against southern Italy. After some initial setbacks, he defeated the Neapolitan commander Niccolò Piccinino, who had invaded his possessions in Romagna and Marche, through the help of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta (who had married his daughter Polissena) and the Venetians, and could return to Milan.

Sforza later found himself warring against Francesco Piccinino (whom he defeated at the Battle of Montolmo in 1444) and, later, the alliance of Visconti, Eugene IV, and Malatesta, who had allegedly murdered Polissena. With the help of Venice, Sforza was again victorious and, in exchange for abandoning the Venetians, received the title of &quot;capitano generale&quot; (commander-in-chief) of the Duchy of Milan&#x27;s armies.

===Duke of Milan===
After Filippo Maria Visconti, duke of Milan, died without a male heir in 1447, fighting broke out to restore the so-called Ambrosian Republic. The name Ambrosian Republic takes its name from St. Ambrose, the patron saint of Milan. Agnese del Maino, his wife&#x27;s mother, convinced the condottiero who held Pavia to restore it to him.

He also received the seigniory of other cities of the duchy, including Lodi, and started to carefully plan the conquest of the ephemeral republic, allying with William VIII of Montferrat and (again) Venice. In 1450, after years of famine, riots raged in the streets of Milan and the city&#x27;s senate decided to entrust him with the duchy. Sforza entered the city as duke on 26 February. It was the first time that such a title was handed over by a lay institution. While the other Italian states gradually recognized Sforza as the legitimate Duke of Milan, he was never able to obtain official investiture from the Holy Roman Emperor. That did not come to the Sforza Dukes until 1494, when Emperor Maximilian formally invested Francesco&#x27;s son, Ludovico, as duke of Milan.

Under his rule (which was moderate and skilful), Sforza modernised the city and duchy. He created an efficient system of taxation that generated enormous revenues for the government, his court became a centre of Renaissance learning and culture, and the people of Milan grew to love him. In Milan, he founded the Ospedale Maggiore, restored the Palazzo ducale, and had the Naviglio d&#x27;Adda, a channel connecting with the River Adda, built.

During Sforza&#x27;s reign, Florence was under the command of Cosimo de&#x27; Medici and the two rulers became close friends. This friendship eventually manifested in first the Peace of Lodi and then the Italian League, a multi-polar defensive alliance of Italian states that succeeded in stabilising almost all of Italy for its duration. After the peace, Sforza renounced part of the conquests in eastern Lombardy obtained by his condottieri Bartolomeo Colleoni, Ludovico Gonzaga, and Roberto Sanseverino d&#x27;Aragona after 1451. As King Alfonso I of Naples was among the signatories of the treaty, Sforza also abandoned his long support of the Angevin pretenders to Naples. He also aimed to conquer Genoa, then an Angevin possession; when a revolt broke out there in 1461, he had Spinetta Campofregoso elected as Doge, as his puppet. Sforza occupied Genoa and Savona in 1464.

Sforza was the first European ruler to follow a foreign policy based on the concept of the balance of power, and the first native Italian ruler to conduct extensive diplomacy outside the peninsula to counter the power of threatening states such as France. Sforza&#x27;s policies succeeded in keeping foreign powers from dominating Italian politics for the rest of the century.

Edward IV of England sought to strengthen friendly relations with Sforza and accordingly offered him membership in the prestigious Order of the Garter. He accepted and became a knight of the Garter in 1463.

Sforza suffered from hydropsy and gout. In 1462, rumours spread that he was dead and a riot exploded in Milan. He however survived for four more years, finally dying in March 1466. He was succeeded as duke by his son, Galeazzo Maria Sforza.

Francesco&#x27;s successor Ludovico commissioned Leonardo da Vinci to design an equestrian statue as part of a monument to Francesco I Sforza. A clay model of a horse which was to be used as part of the design was completed by Leonardo in 1492—but the statue was never built. In 1999 the horse alone was cast from Leonardo&#x27;s original designs in bronze and placed in Milan outside the racetrack of Ippodromo del Galoppo.

<text>A folk dance is a dance that reflects the life of the people of a certain country or region. Not all ethnic dances are folk dances. For example, ritual dances or dances of ritual origin are not considered to be folk dances. Ritual dances are usually called &quot;religious dances&quot; because of their purpose.

The terms &quot;ethnic&quot; and &quot;traditional&quot; are used when it is required to emphasize the cultural roots of the dance. In this sense, nearly all folk dances are ethnic ones. If some dances, such as polka, cross ethnic boundaries and even cross the boundary between &quot;folk&quot; and &quot;ballroom dance&quot;, ethnic differences are often considerable enough to mention.

==Background==

Folk dances share some or all of the following attributes:

*Dances are usually held at folk dance gatherings or social functions by people with little or no professional training, often to traditional music.
*Dances not generally designed for public performance or the stage, though they may later be arranged and set for stage performances.
*Execution dominated by an inherited tradition from various international cultures rather than innovation (though folk traditions change over time).
*New dancers often learn informally by observing others or receiving help from others.
More controversially, some people define folk dancing as dancing for which there is no governing body or dancing for which there are no competitive or professional institutions. The term &quot;folk dance&quot; is sometimes applied to dances of historical importance in European culture and history; typically originating before the 20th century. For other cultures the terms &quot;ethnic dance&quot; or &quot;traditional dance&quot; are sometimes used, although the latter terms may encompass ceremonial dances.

There are a number of modern dances, such as hip hop dance, that evolve spontaneously, but the term &quot;folk dance&quot; is generally not applied to them, and the terms &quot;street dance&quot; or &quot;vernacular dance&quot; are used instead. The term &quot;folk dance&quot; is reserved for dances which are to a significant degree bound by tradition and originated in the times when the distinction existed between the dances of &quot;common folk&quot; and the dances of the modern ballroom dances originated from folk ones.

Sword dances include long sword dances and rapper dancing. Some choreographed dances such as contra dance, Scottish highland dance, Scottish country dance, and modern western square dance, are called folk dances, though this is not true in the strictest sense. Country dance overlaps with contemporary folk dance and ballroom dance. Most country dances and ballroom dances originated from folk dances, with gradual refinement over the years.

People familiar with folk dancing can often determine what country a dance is from even if they have not seen that particular dance before. Some countries&#x27; dances have features that are unique to that country, although neighboring countries sometimes have similar features. For example, the German and Austrian schuhplattling dance consists of slapping the body and shoes in a fixed pattern, a feature that few other countries&#x27; dances have.

Folk dances sometimes evolved long before current political boundaries, so that certain dances are shared by several countries. For example, some Serbian, Bulgarian, and Croatian dances share the same or similar dances, and sometimes even use the same name and music for those dances.

International folk dance groups exist in cities and college campuses in many countries, in which dancers learn folk dances from many cultures for recreation.

Balfolk events are social dance events with live music in Western and Central Europe, originating in the folk revival of the 1970s and becoming more popular since about 2000, where popular European partner dances from the end of the 19th century such as the schottische, polka, mazurka and waltz are danced, with additionally other European folk dances, mainly from France, but also from Sweden, Spain and other countries.
