<text>Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky () was a Russian novelist, short story writer, essayist and journalist. Numerous literary critics regard him as one of the greatest novelists in all of world literature, as many of his works are considered highly influential masterpieces. Dostoevsky&#x27;s literary works explore the human condition in the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmospheres of 19th-century Russia, and engage with a variety of philosophical and religious themes. His most acclaimed novels include &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (1866), &quot;The Idiot&quot; (1869), &quot;Demons&quot; (1872), &quot;The Adolescent&quot; (1875), and &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; (1880). His 1864 novella &quot;Notes from Underground&quot; is considered to be one of the first works of existentialist literature.

Born in Moscow in 1821, Dostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age through fairy tales and legends, and through books by Russian and foreign authors. His mother died in 1837 when he was 15, and around the same time, he left school to enter the Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute. After graduating, he worked as an engineer and briefly enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, translating books to earn extra money. In the mid-1840s he wrote his first novel, &quot;Poor Folk&quot;, which gained him entry into Saint Petersburg&#x27;s literary circles. However, he was arrested in 1849 for belonging to a literary group, the Petrashevsky Circle, that discussed banned books critical of Tsarist Russia. Dostoevsky was sentenced to death but the sentence was commuted at the last moment. He spent four years in a Siberian prison camp, followed by six years of compulsory military service in exile. In the following years, Dostoevsky worked as a journalist, publishing and editing several magazines of his own and later &quot;A Writer&#x27;s Diary&quot;, a collection of his writings. He began to travel around western Europe and developed a gambling addiction, which led to financial hardship. For a time, he had to beg for money, but he eventually became one of the most widely read and highly regarded Russian writers.

Dostoevsky&#x27;s body of work consists of thirteen novels, three novellas, seventeen short stories, and numerous other works. His writings were widely read both within and beyond his native Russia and influenced an equally great number of later writers including Russians such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Anton Chekhov, philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre, and the emergence of Existentialism and Freudianism. His books have been translated into more than 170 languages, and served as the inspiration for many films.

== Ancestry ==
Dostoevsky&#x27;s paternal ancestors were part of a Russian noble family of Russian Orthodox Christians. The family traced its roots back to Danilo Irtishch, who was granted lands in the Pinsk region (for centuries part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, now in modern-day Belarus) in 1509 for his services under a local prince, his progeny then taking the name &quot;Dostoevsky&quot; based on a village there called (derived from Old Polish &quot;dostojnik&quot; – dignitary).

Dostoevsky&#x27;s immediate ancestors on his mother&#x27;s side were merchants; the male line on his father&#x27;s side were priests.

In 1809, the 20-year-old Mikhail Dostoevsky enrolled in Moscow&#x27;s Imperial Medical-Surgical Academy. From there he was assigned to a Moscow hospital, where he served as military doctor, and in 1818 he was appointed a senior physician. In 1819 he married Maria Nechayeva. The following year, he took up a post at the Mariinsky Hospital for the poor. In 1828, when his two sons, Mikhail and Fyodor, were eight and seven respectively, he was promoted to collegiate assessor, a position which raised his legal status to that of the nobility and enabled him to acquire a small estate in Darovoye, a town about 150 km (100 miles) from Moscow, where the family usually spent the summers. Dostoevsky&#x27;s parents subsequently had six more children: Varvara (1822–1892), Andrei (1825–1897), Lyubov (born and died 1829), Vera (1829–1896), Nikolai (1831–1883) and Aleksandra (1835–1889).
== Childhood (1821–1836) ==
Fyodor Dostoevsky, born on in Moscow, was the second child of Dr. Mikhail Dostoevsky and Maria Dostoevskaya (born Nechayeva). He was raised in the family home in the grounds of the Mariinsky Hospital for the Poor, which was in a lower class district on the edges of Moscow. Dostoevsky encountered the patients, who were at the lower end of the Russian social scale, when playing in the hospital gardens.

Dostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age. From the age of three, he was read heroic sagas, fairy tales and legends by his nanny, Alena Frolovna, an especially influential figure in his upbringing and his love for fictional stories. When he was four, his mother used the Bible to teach him to read and write. His parents introduced him to a wide range of literature, including Russian writers Karamzin, Pushkin and Derzhavin; Gothic fiction such as the works from writer Ann Radcliffe; romantic works by Schiller and Goethe; heroic tales by Miguel de Cervantes and Walter Scott; and Homer&#x27;s epics. Dostoevsky was greatly influenced by the work of Nikolai Gogol. Although his father&#x27;s approach to education has been described as strict and harsh, Dostoevsky himself reported that his imagination was brought alive by nightly readings by his parents.

Some of his childhood experiences found their way into his writings. When a nine-year-old girl had been raped by a drunk, he was asked to fetch his father to attend to her. The incident haunted him, and the theme of the desire of a mature man for a young girl appears in &quot;The Devils&quot;, &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, and other writings. An incident involving a family servant, or serf, in the estate in Darovoye, is described in &quot;The Peasant Marey&quot;: when the young Dostoevsky imagines hearing a wolf in the forest, Marey, who is working nearby, comforts him.

Another memory that Dostoyevsky referred to in his prose was summer trips to his father&#x27;s estate in the Kashirsky District of the Tula Governorate, which was purchased between 1831 and 1833. 

Although Dostoevsky had a delicate physical constitution, his parents described him as hot-headed, stubborn, and cheeky. In 1833, Dostoevsky&#x27;s father, who was profoundly religious, sent him to a French boarding school and then to the Chermak boarding school. He was described as a pale, introverted dreamer and an over-excitable romantic. To pay the school fees, his father borrowed money and extended his private medical practice. Dostoevsky felt out of place among his aristocratic classmates at the Moscow school, and the experience was later reflected in some of his works, notably &quot;The Adolescent&quot;.

== Youth (1836–1843) ==

On 27 February 1837, Dostoevsky&#x27;s mother died of tuberculosis. The previous May, his parents had sent Dostoevsky and his brother Mikhail to Saint Petersburg to attend the free Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute, forcing the brothers to abandon their academic studies for military careers. Dostoevsky entered the academy in January 1838, but only with the help of family members. Mikhail was refused admission on health grounds and was sent to an academy in Reval (now Tallinn, Estonia).

Dostoevsky disliked the academy, primarily because of his lack of interest in science, mathematics, and military engineering and his preference for drawing and architecture. As his friend Konstantin Trutovsky once said, &quot;There was no student in the entire institution with less of a military bearing than F.M. Dostoevsky. He moved clumsily and jerkily; his uniform hung awkwardly on him; and his knapsack, shako and rifle all looked like some sort of fetter he had been forced to wear for a time and which lay heavily on him.&quot; Dostoevsky&#x27;s character and interests made him an outsider among his 120 classmates: he showed bravery and a strong sense of justice, protected newcomers, aligned himself with teachers, criticised corruption among officers, and helped poor farmers. Although he was solitary and inhabited his own literary world, he was respected by his classmates. His reclusiveness and interest in religion earned him the nickname &quot;Monk Photius&quot;.

Signs of Dostoevsky&#x27;s epilepsy may have first appeared on learning of the death of his father on 16 June 1839, although the reports of a seizure originated from accounts written by his daughter (later expanded by Sigmund Freud) which are now considered to be unreliable. His father&#x27;s official cause of death was an apoplectic stroke, but a neighbour, Pavel Khotiaintsev, accused the father&#x27;s serfs of murder. Had the serfs been found guilty and sent to Siberia, Khotiaintsev would have been in a position to buy the vacated land. The serfs were acquitted in a trial in Tula, but Dostoevsky&#x27;s brother Mikhail perpetuated the story. After his father&#x27;s death, Dostoevsky continued his studies, passed his exams and obtained the rank of engineer cadet, entitling him to live away from the academy. He visited Mikhail in Reval (Tallinn) and frequently attended concerts, operas, plays and ballets. During this time, two of his friends introduced him to gambling.

On 12 August 1843 Dostoevsky took a job as a lieutenant engineer and lived with Adolph Totleben in an apartment owned by Dr. Rizenkampf, a friend of Mikhail. Rizenkampf characterised him as &quot;no less good-natured and no less courteous than his brother, but when not in a good mood he often looked at everything through dark glasses, became vexed, forgot good manners, and sometimes was carried away to the point of abusiveness and loss of self-awareness&quot;. Dostoevsky&#x27;s first completed literary work, a translation of Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s novel &quot;Eugénie Grandet&quot;, was published in June and July 1843 in the 6th and 7th volumes of the journal &quot;Repertoire and Pantheon&quot;, followed by several other translations. None were successful, and his financial difficulties led him to write a novel.

== Career ==
=== Early career (1844–1849) ===
Dostoevsky completed his first novel, &quot;Poor Folk&quot;, in May 1845. His friend Dmitry Grigorovich, with whom he was sharing an apartment at the time, took the manuscript to the poet Nikolay Nekrasov, who in turn showed it to the influential literary critic Vissarion Belinsky. Belinsky described it as Russia&#x27;s first &quot;social novel&quot;. &quot;Poor Folk&quot; was released on 15 January 1846 in the &quot;St Petersburg Collection&quot; almanac and became a commercial success.

Dostoevsky felt that his military career would endanger his now flourishing literary career, so he wrote a letter asking to resign his post. Shortly thereafter, he wrote his second novel, &quot;The Double&quot;, which appeared in the journal &quot;Notes of the Fatherland&quot; on 30 January 1846, before being published in February. Around the same time, Dostoevsky discovered socialism through the writings of French thinkers Fourier, Cabet, Proudhon and Saint-Simon. Through his relationship with Belinsky he expanded his knowledge of the philosophy of socialism. He was attracted to its logic, its sense of justice and its preoccupation with the destitute and the disadvantaged. However, his Russian Orthodox faith and religious sensibilities could not accord with Belinsky&#x27;s admixture of atheism, utilitarianism and scientific materialism, leading to increasing friction between them. Dostoevsky eventually parted with him and his associates.

After &quot;The Double&quot; received negative reviews (including a particularly scathing one from Belinsky) Dostoevsky&#x27;s health declined and his seizures became more frequent, but he continued writing. From 1846 to 1848 he published several short stories in the magazine &quot;Notes of the Fatherland&quot;, including &quot;Mr. Prokharchin&quot;, &quot;The Landlady&quot;, &quot;A Weak Heart&quot;, and &quot;White Nights&quot;. The negative reception of these stories, combined with his health problems and Belinsky&#x27;s attacks, caused him distress and financial difficulty, but this was greatly alleviated when he joined the utopian socialist Beketov circle, a tightly knit community which helped him to survive. When the circle dissolved, Dostoevsky befriended Apollon Maykov and his brother Valerian. In 1846, on the recommendation of the poet Aleksey Pleshcheyev, he joined the Petrashevsky Circle, founded by Mikhail Petrashevsky, who had proposed social reforms in Russia. Mikhail Bakunin once wrote to Alexander Herzen that the group was &quot;the most innocent and harmless company&quot; and its members were &quot;systematic opponents of all revolutionary goals and means&quot;. Dostoevsky used the circle&#x27;s library on Saturdays and Sundays and occasionally participated in their discussions on freedom from censorship and the abolition of serfdom. Bakunin&#x27;s description, however, was not true of the aristocrat Nikolay Speshnev, who joined the circle in 1848 and set about creating a secret revolutionary society from amongst its members. Dostoevsky himself became a member of this society, was aware of its conspiratorial aims, and actively participated, although he harboured significant doubts about their actions and intentions.

In 1849, the first parts of &quot;Netochka Nezvanova&quot;, a novel Dostoevsky had been planning since 1846, were published in &quot;Notes of the Fatherland&quot;, but his banishment ended the project leaving only what was supposed to be the prologue of the novel. Dostoevsky never attempted to complete it leaving only a sketch of the novel behind.

=== Siberian exile (1849–1854) ===
The members of the Petrashevsky Circle were denounced to Liprandi, an official at the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Dostoevsky was accused of reading works by Belinsky, including the banned &quot;Letter to Gogol&quot;, and of circulating copies of these and other works. Antonelli, the government agent who had reported the group, wrote in his statement that at least one of the papers criticised Russian politics and religion. Dostoevsky responded to these charges by declaring that he had read the essays only &quot;as a literary monument, neither more nor less&quot;; he spoke of &quot;personality and human egoism&quot; rather than of politics. Even so, he and his fellow &quot;conspirators&quot; were arrested on 23 April 1849 at the request of Count A. Orlov and Tsar Nicholas I, who feared a revolution like the Decembrist revolt of 1825 in Russia and the Revolutions of 1848 in Europe. The members were held in the well-defended Peter and Paul Fortress, which housed the most dangerous convicts.

The case was discussed for four months by an investigative commission headed by the Tsar, with Adjutant General Ivan Nabokov, senator Prince Pavel Gagarin, Prince Vasili Dolgorukov, General Yakov Rostovtsev and General Leonty Dubelt, head of the secret police. They sentenced the members of the circle to death by firing squad, and the prisoners were taken to Semyonov Place in Saint Petersburg on 23 December 1849. They were split into three-man groups and the first group was taken in front of the firing squad. Dostoevsky was the third in the second row; next to him stood Pleshcheyev and Durov. The execution was stayed when a cart delivered a letter from the Tsar commuting the sentence. Dostoevsky later described the experience of what he believed to be the last moments of his life in his novel &quot;The Idiot&quot;. The story of a young man sentenced to death by firing squad but reprieved at the last moment is recounted by the main character, Prince Myshkin, who describes the experience from the point of view of the victim, and considers the philosophical and spiritual implications.

Dostoevsky served four years of exile with hard labour at a katorga prison camp in Omsk, Siberia, followed by a term of compulsory military service. After a fourteen-day sleigh ride, the prisoners reached Tobolsk, a prisoner way station. Despite the circumstances, Dostoevsky consoled the other prisoners, such as the Petrashevist Ivan Yastrzhembsky, who was surprised by Dostoevsky&#x27;s kindness and eventually abandoned his decision to kill himself. In Tobolsk, the members received food and clothes from the Decembrist women, as well as several copies of the New Testament with a ten-ruble banknote inside each copy. Eleven days later, Dostoevsky reached Omsk together with just one other member of the Petrashevsky Circle, the writer Sergei Durov. Dostoevsky described his barracks:

Classified as &quot;one of the most dangerous convicts&quot;, Dostoevsky had his hands and feet shackled until his release. He was only permitted to read his New Testament Bible. In addition to his seizures, he had haemorrhoids, lost weight and was &quot;burned by some fever, trembling and feeling too hot or too cold every night&quot;. The smell of the privy pervaded the entire building, and the small bathroom had to suffice for more than 200 people. Dostoevsky was occasionally sent to the military hospital, where he read newspapers and Dickens novels. He was respected by most of the other prisoners, but despised by some Polish political prisoners because of his Russian nationalism and anti-Polish sentiments.

=== Release from prison and first marriage (1854–1866) ===

After his release on 14 February 1854, Dostoevsky asked Mikhail to help him financially and to send him books by Vico, Guizot, Ranke, Hegel and Kant. &quot;The House of the Dead&quot;, based on his experience in prison, was published in 1861 in the journal &quot;Vremya&quot; (&quot;Time&quot;) – it was the first published novel about Russian prisons. Before moving in mid-March to Semipalatinsk, where he was forced to serve in the Siberian Army Corps of the Seventh Line Battalion, Dostoevsky met geographer Pyotr Semyonov and ethnographer Shokan Walikhanuli. Around November 1854, he met Baron Alexander Egorovich Wrangel, an admirer of his books, who had attended the aborted execution. They both rented houses in the Cossack Garden outside Semipalatinsk. Wrangel remarked that Dostoevsky &quot;looked morose. His sickly, pale face was covered with freckles, and his blond hair was cut short. He was a little over average height and looked at me intensely with his sharp, grey-blue eyes. It was as if he were trying to look into my soul and discover what kind of man I was.&quot;

In Semipalatinsk, Dostoevsky tutored several schoolchildren and came into contact with upper-class families, including that of Lieutenant-Colonel Belikhov, who used to invite him to read passages from newspapers and magazines. During a visit to Belikhov, Dostoevsky met the family of Alexander Ivanovich Isaev and Maria Dmitrievna Isaeva and fell in love with the latter. Alexander Isaev took a new post in Kuznetsk, where he died in August 1855. Maria and her son then moved with Dostoevsky to Barnaul. In 1856, Dostoevsky sent a letter through Wrangel to General Eduard Totleben, apologising for his activity in several utopian circles. As a result, he obtained the right to publish books and to marry, although he remained under police surveillance for the rest of his life. Maria married Dostoevsky in Kuznetsk on 7 February 1857, even though she had initially refused his marriage proposal, stating that they were not meant for each other and that his poor financial situation precluded marriage. Their family life was unhappy and she found it difficult to cope with his seizures. Describing their relationship, he wrote: &quot;Because of her strange, suspicious and fantastic character, we were definitely not happy together, but we could not stop loving each other; and the more unhappy we were, the more attached to each other we became&quot;. They mostly lived apart. In 1859 he was released from military service because of deteriorating health and was granted permission to return to European Russia, first to Tver, where he met his brother for the first time in ten years, and then to St Petersburg.

The short story &quot;A Little Hero&quot; (Dostoevsky&#x27;s only work completed in prison) appeared in a journal, but &quot;Uncle&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;The Village of Stepanchikovo&quot; were not published until 1860. &quot;Notes from the House of the Dead&quot; was released in &quot;Russky Mir&quot; (Russian World) in September 1860. &quot;Humiliated and Insulted&quot; was published in the new &quot;Vremya&quot; magazine, which had been created with the help of funds from his brother&#x27;s cigarette factory.

Dostoevsky travelled to western Europe for the first time on 7 June 1862, visiting Cologne, Berlin, Dresden, Wiesbaden, Belgium, and Paris. In London, he met Herzen and visited the Crystal Palace. He travelled with Nikolay Strakhov through Switzerland and several North Italian cities, including Turin, Livorno, and Florence. He recorded his impressions of those trips in the essay &quot;Winter Notes on Summer Impressions&quot;, in which he also criticised capitalism, social modernisation, materialism, Catholicism and Protestantism. Dostoevsky viewed the Crystal Palace as a monument to soulless modern society, the myth of progress, and the worship of empty materialism.

From August to October 1863, Dostoevsky made another trip to western Europe. He met his second love, Polina Suslova, in Paris and lost nearly all his money gambling in Wiesbaden and Baden-Baden. In 1864 his wife Maria and his brother Mikhail died, and Dostoevsky became the lone parent of his stepson Pasha and the sole supporter of his brother&#x27;s family. The failure of &quot;Epoch&quot;, the magazine he had founded with Mikhail after the suppression of &quot;Vremya&quot;, worsened his financial situation, although the continued help of his relatives and friends averted bankruptcy.

=== Second marriage and honeymoon (1866–1871) ===
The first two parts of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; were published in January and February 1866 in the periodical &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot;, attracting at least 500 new subscribers to the magazine.

Dostoevsky returned to Saint Petersburg in mid-September and promised his editor, Fyodor Stellovsky, that he would complete &quot;The Gambler&quot;, a short novel focused on gambling addiction, by November, although he had not yet begun writing it. One of Dostoevsky&#x27;s friends, Aleksandr Milyukov, advised him to hire a secretary. Dostoevsky contacted stenographer Pavel Olkhin from Saint Petersburg, who recommended his pupil, the twenty-year-old Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina. Her shorthand helped Dostoevsky to complete &quot;The Gambler&quot; on 30 October, after 26 days&#x27; work. She remarked that Dostoevsky was of average height but always tried to carry himself erect. &quot;He had light brown, slightly reddish hair, he used some hair conditioner, and he combed his hair in a diligent way ... his eyes, they were different: one was dark brown; in the other, the pupil was so big that you could not see its color, [this was caused by an injury]. The strangeness of his eyes gave Dostoyevsky some mysterious appearance. His face was pale, and it looked unhealthy.&quot;

On 15 February 1867 Dostoevsky married Snitkina in Trinity Cathedral, Saint Petersburg. The 7,000 rubles he had earned from &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; did not cover their debts, forcing Anna to sell her valuables. On 14 April 1867, they began a delayed honeymoon in Germany with the money gained from the sale. They stayed in Berlin and visited the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden, where he sought inspiration for his writing. They continued their trip through Germany, visiting Frankfurt, Darmstadt, Heidelberg and Karlsruhe. They spent five weeks in Baden-Baden, where Dostoevsky had a quarrel with Turgenev and again lost much money at the roulette table. At one point, his wife was reportedly forced to pawn her underwear. The couple travelled on to Geneva.

In September 1867, Dostoevsky began work on &quot;The Idiot&quot;, and after a prolonged planning process that bore little resemblance to the published novel, he eventually managed to write the first 100 pages in only 23 days; the serialisation began in &quot;The Russian Messenger &quot;in January 1868.

Their first child, Sofya, had been conceived in Baden-Baden, and was born in Geneva on 5 March 1868. The baby died of pneumonia three months later, and Anna recalled how Dostoevsky &quot;wept and sobbed like a woman in despair&quot;. Sofya was buried at the Cimetière des Rois (&quot;Cemetery of Kings&quot;), which is considered the Genevan Panthéon. The grave was later dissolved but in 1986 the International Dostoevsky Society donated a commemorative plaque.

The couple moved from Geneva to Vevey and then to Milan before continuing to Florence. &quot;The Idiot&quot; was completed there in January 1869, the final part appearing in &quot;The Russian Messenger &quot;in February 1869. Anna gave birth to their second daughter, Lyubov, on 26 September 1869 in Dresden. In April 1871, Dostoevsky made a final visit to a gambling hall in Wiesbaden. Anna claimed that he stopped gambling after the birth of their second daughter, but this is a subject of debate.

After hearing news that the socialist revolutionary group &quot;People&#x27;s Vengeance&quot; had murdered one of its own members, Ivan Ivanov, on 21 November 1869, Dostoevsky began writing &quot;Demons&quot;. In 1871, Dostoevsky and Anna travelled by train to Berlin. During the trip, he burnt several manuscripts, including those of &quot;The Idiot&quot;, because he was concerned about potential problems with customs. The family arrived in Saint Petersburg on 8 July, marking the end of a honeymoon (originally planned for three months) that had lasted over four years.

=== Back in Russia (1871–1875) ===
Back in Russia in July 1871, the family was again in financial trouble and had to sell their remaining possessions. Their son Fyodor was born on 16 July, and they moved to an apartment near the Institute of Technology soon after. They hoped to cancel their large debts by selling their rental house in Peski, but difficulties with the tenant resulted in a relatively low selling price, and disputes with their creditors continued. Anna proposed that they raise money on her husband&#x27;s copyrights and negotiate with the creditors to pay off their debts in installments.

Dostoevsky revived his friendships with Maykov and Strakhov and made new acquaintances, including church politician Terty Filipov and the brothers Vsevolod and Vladimir Solovyov. Konstantin Pobedonostsev, future Imperial High Commissioner of the Most Holy Synod, influenced Dostoevsky&#x27;s political progression to conservatism. Around early 1872 the family spent several months in Staraya Russa, a town known for its mineral spa. Dostoevsky&#x27;s work was delayed when Anna&#x27;s sister Maria Svatkovskaya died on 1 May 1872, from either typhus or malaria, and Anna developed an abscess on her throat.

The family returned to St Petersburg in September. &quot;Demons&quot; was finished on 26 November and released in January 1873 by the &quot;Dostoevsky Publishing Company&quot;, which was founded by Dostoevsky and his wife. Although they accepted only cash payments and the bookshop was in their own apartment, the business was successful, and they sold around 3,000 copies of &quot;Demons&quot;. Anna managed the finances. Dostoevsky proposed that they establish a new periodical, which would be called &quot;A Writer&#x27;s Diary&quot; and would include a collection of essays, but funds were lacking, and the &quot;Diary&quot; was published in Vladimir Meshchersky&#x27;s &quot;The Citizen&quot;, beginning on 1 January, in return for a salary of 3,000 rubles per year. In the summer of 1873, Anna returned to Staraya Russa with the children, while Dostoevsky stayed in St Petersburg to continue with his &quot;Diary&quot;.

In March 1874, Dostoevsky left &quot;The Citizen&quot; because of the stressful work and interference from the Russian bureaucracy. In his fifteen months with &quot;The Citizen&quot;, he had been taken to court twice: on 11 June 1873 for citing the words of Prince Meshchersky without permission, and again on 23 March 1874. Dostoevsky offered to sell a new novel he had not yet begun to write to &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot;, but the magazine refused. Nikolay Nekrasov suggested that he publish &quot;A Writer&#x27;s Diary&quot; in &quot;Notes of the Fatherland&quot;; he would receive 250 rubles for each printer&#x27;s sheet – 100 more than the text&#x27;s publication in &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot; would have earned. Dostoevsky accepted. As his health began to decline, he consulted several doctors in St Petersburg and was advised to take a cure outside Russia. Around July, he reached Ems and consulted a physician, who diagnosed him with acute catarrh. During his stay he began &quot;The Adolescent&quot;. He returned to Saint Petersburg in late July.

Anna proposed that they spend the winter in Staraya Russa to allow Dostoevsky to rest, although doctors had suggested a second visit to Ems because his health had previously improved there. On 10 August 1875 his son Alexey was born in Staraya Russa, and in mid-September the family returned to Saint Petersburg. Dostoevsky finished &quot;The Adolescent&quot; at the end of 1875, although passages of it had been serialised in &quot;Notes of the Fatherland&quot; since January. &quot;The Adolescent&quot; chronicles the life of Arkady Dolgoruky, the illegitimate child of the landowner Versilov and a peasant mother. It deals primarily with the relationship between father and son, which became a frequent theme in Dostoevsky&#x27;s subsequent works.

=== Last years (1876–1881) ===

In early 1876, Dostoevsky continued work on his &quot;Diary&quot;. The book includes numerous essays and a few short stories about society, religion, politics and ethics. The collection sold more than twice as many copies as his previous books. Dostoevsky received more letters from readers than ever before, and people of all ages and occupations visited him. With assistance from Anna&#x27;s brother, the family bought a dacha in Staraya Russa. In the summer of 1876, Dostoevsky began experiencing shortness of breath again. He visited Ems for the third time and was told that he might live for another 15 years if he moved to a healthier climate. When he returned to Russia, Tsar Alexander II ordered Dostoevsky to visit his palace to present the &quot;Diary&quot; to him, and he asked him to educate his sons, Sergey and Paul. This visit further increased Dosteyevsky&#x27;s circle of acquaintances. He was a frequent guest in several salons in Saint Petersburg and met many famous people, including Countess Sophia Tolstaya, Yakov Polonsky, Sergei Witte, Alexey Suvorin, Anton Rubinstein and Ilya Repin.

Dostoevsky&#x27;s health declined further, and in March 1877 he had four epileptic seizures. Rather than returning to Ems, he visited Maly Prikol, a manor near Kursk. While returning to St Petersburg to finalise his &quot;Diary&quot;, he visited Darovoye, where he had spent much of his childhood. In December he attended Nekrasov&#x27;s funeral and gave a speech. He was appointed an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, from which he received an honorary certificate in February 1879. He declined an invitation to an international congress on copyright in Paris after his son Alyosha had a severe epileptic seizure and died on 16 May. The family later moved to the apartment where Dostoevsky had written his first works. Around this time, he was elected to the board of directors of the Slavic Benevolent Society in Saint Petersburg. That summer, he was elected to the honorary committee of the Association Littéraire et Artistique Internationale, whose members included Victor Hugo, Ivan Turgenev, Paul Heyse, Alfred Tennyson, Anthony Trollope, Henry Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Leo Tolstoy. Dostoevsky made his fourth and final visit to Ems in early August 1879. He was diagnosed with early-stage pulmonary emphysema, which his doctor believed could be successfully managed, but not cured.

On 3 February 1880 Dostoevsky was elected vice-president of the Slavic Benevolent Society, and he was invited to speak at the unveiling of the Pushkin memorial in Moscow. On 8 June he delivered his speech, giving an impressive performance that had a significant emotional impact on his audience. His speech was met with thunderous applause, and even his long-time rival Turgenev embraced him. Konstantin Staniukovich praised the speech in his essay &quot;The Pushkin Anniversary and Dostoevsky&#x27;s Speech&quot; in &quot;The Business&quot;, writing that &quot;the language of Dostoevsky&#x27;s [Pushkin Speech] really looks like a sermon. He speaks with the tone of a prophet. He makes a sermon like a pastor; it is very deep, sincere, and we understand that he wants to impress the emotions of his listeners.&quot; The speech was criticised later by liberal political scientist Alexander Gradovsky, who thought that Dostoevsky idolised &quot;the people&quot;, and by conservative thinker Konstantin Leontiev, who, in his essay &quot;On Universal Love&quot;, compared the speech to French utopian socialism. The attacks led to a further deterioration in his health.

==Death==

On , while searching for members of the terrorist organisation Narodnaya Volya (&quot;The People&#x27;s Will&quot;) who would soon assassinate Tsar Alexander II, the Tsar&#x27;s secret police executed a search warrant in the apartment of one of Dostoevsky&#x27;s neighbours. On the following day, Dostoevsky suffered a pulmonary haemorrhage. Anna denied that the search had caused it, saying that the haemorrhage had occurred after her husband had been looking for a dropped pen holder. After another haemorrhage, Anna called the doctors, who gave a poor prognosis. A third haemorrhage followed shortly afterwards. While seeing his children before dying, Dostoevsky requested that the parable of the Prodigal Son be read to his children. The profound meaning of this request is pointed out by Joseph Frank:
It was this parable of transgression, repentance, and forgiveness that he wished to leave as a last heritage to his children, and it may well be seen as his own ultimate understanding of the meaning of his life and the message of his work.

Among Dostoevsky&#x27;s last words was his quotation of : &quot;But John forbad him, saying, I have a need to be baptised of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness&quot;, and he finished with &quot;Hear now—permit it. Do not restrain me!&quot;. His last words to his wife Anna were: &quot;Remember, Anya, I have always loved you passionately and have never been unfaithful to you ever, even in my thoughts!&quot; When he died, his body was placed on a table, following Russian custom. He was interred in the Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Convent, near his favourite poets, Nikolay Karamzin and Vasily Zhukovsky. It is unclear how many attended his funeral. According to one reporter, more than 100,000 mourners were present, while others describe attendance between 40,000 and 50,000. His tombstone is inscribed with lines from the New Testament:

== Personal life ==
=== Previous relationships ===
Before meeting and marrying his future wife in 1867, Dostoevsky had other relationships. Dostoevsky had his first known affair with Avdotya Panaeva, whom he met in Ivan Panaev&#x27;s circle in the early 1840s. He described her as educated, interested in literature, and a femme fatale. He admitted later that he was uncertain about their relationship. According to Anna Dostoevskaya&#x27;s memoirs, Dostoevsky once asked his sister&#x27;s sister-in-law, Yelena Ivanova, whether she would marry him, hoping to replace her mortally ill husband after he died, but she rejected his proposal.

Dostoevsky and Polina Suslova had a short but intimate affair, which peaked in the winter of 1862–1863. Suslova&#x27;s dalliance with a Spaniard in late spring and Dostoevsky&#x27;s gambling addiction and age ended their relationship. He later described her in a letter to Nadezhda Suslova as a &quot;great egoist. Her egoism and her vanity are colossal. She demands &quot;everything&quot; of other people, all the perfections, and does not pardon the slightest imperfection in the light of other qualities that one may possess&quot;, and later stated &quot;I still love her, but I do not want to love her any more. She doesn&#x27;t deserve this love ...&quot; In 1858 Dostoevsky had a romance with comic actress Aleksandra Ivanovna Schubert. Although she divorced Dostoevsky&#x27;s friend Stepan Yanovsky, she would not live with him. Dostoevsky did not love her either, but they were probably good friends. She wrote that he &quot;became very attracted to me&quot;.

Through a worker in &quot;Epoch&quot;, Dostoevsky learned of the Russian-born Martha Brown (née Elizaveta Andreyevna Chlebnikova), who had had affairs with several westerners. Her relationship with Dostoevsky is known only through letters written between November 1864 and January 1865. In 1865, Dostoevsky met Anna Korvin-Krukovskaya. Their relationship is not verified; Anna Dostoevskaya spoke of a good affair, but Korvin-Krukovskaya&#x27;s sister, the mathematician Sofia Kovalevskaya, thought that Korvin-Krukovskaya had rejected him.

=== Political beliefs ===
In his youth, Dostoevsky enjoyed reading Nikolai Karamzin&#x27;s &quot;History of the Russian State&quot; (published 1818–1829), which praised conservatism and Russian independence, ideas that Dostoevsky would embrace later in life. Before his arrest for participating in the Petrashevsky Circle in 1849, Dostoevsky remarked, &quot;As far as I am concerned, nothing was ever more ridiculous than the idea of a republican government in Russia.&quot; In an 1881 edition of his &quot;Diaries&quot;, Dostoevsky stated that the Tsar and the people should form a unity: &quot;For the people, the tsar is not an external power, not the power of some conqueror ... but a power of all the people, an all-unifying power the people themselves desired.&quot;

While critical of serfdom, Dostoevsky was skeptical about the creation of a constitution, a concept he viewed as unrelated to Russia&#x27;s history. He described it as a mere &quot;gentleman&#x27;s rule&quot; and believed that &quot;a constitution would simply enslave the people&quot;. He advocated social change instead, for example removal of the feudal system and a weakening of the divisions between the peasantry and the affluent classes. His ideal was a utopian, Christianized Russia where &quot;if everyone were actively Christian, not a single social question would come up ... If they were Christians they would settle everything&quot;. He thought democracy and oligarchy were poor systems; of France he wrote, &quot;the oligarchs are only concerned with the interest of the wealthy; the democrats, only with the interest of the poor; but the interests of society, the interest of all and the future of France as a whole—no one there bothers about these things.&quot; He maintained that political parties ultimately led to social discord. In the 1860s, he discovered &quot;Pochvennichestvo&quot;, a movement similar to Slavophilism in that it rejected Europe&#x27;s culture and contemporary philosophical movements, such as nihilism and materialism. &quot;Pochvennichestvo&quot; differed from Slavophilism in aiming to establish, not an isolated Russia, but a more open state modelled on the Russia of Peter the Great.

In his incomplete article &quot;Socialism and Christianity&quot;, Dostoevsky claimed that civilisation (&quot;the second stage in human history&quot;) had become degraded, and that it was moving towards liberalism and losing its faith in God. He asserted that the traditional concept of Christianity should be recovered. He thought that contemporary western Europe had &quot;rejected the single formula for their salvation that came from God and was proclaimed through revelation, &#x27;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself&#x27;, and replaced it with practical conclusions such as, ″&quot;Chacun pour soi et Dieu pour tous&quot;″ [Every man for himself and God for all], or &quot;scientific&quot; slogans like &#x27;the struggle for survival. He considered this crisis to be the consequence of the collision between communal and individual interests, brought about by a decline in religious and moral principles.

Dostoevsky distinguished three &quot;enormous world ideas&quot; prevalent in his time: Roman Catholicism, Protestantism and (Russian) Orthodoxy. He claimed that Catholicism had continued the tradition of Imperial Rome and had thus become anti-Christian and proto-socialist,
inasmuch as the Church&#x27;s interest in political and mundane affairs led it to abandon the idea of Christ. For Dostoevsky, socialism was &quot;the latest incarnation of the Catholic idea&quot; and its &quot;natural ally&quot;. He found Protestantism self-contradictory and claimed that it would ultimately lose power and spirituality. He deemed (Russian) Orthodoxy to be the ideal form of Christianity.

For all that, to place Dostoevsky politically is not simple: as a Christian, he rejected atheistic socialism; as a traditionalist, he rejected the destruction of the institutions; and, as a pacifist, he rejected any violent method or upheaval led by either progressives or reactionaries. He supported private property and business rights, and did not agree with many criticisms of the free market from the socialist utopians of his time.

During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, Dostoevsky asserted that war might be necessary if salvation were to be granted. He wanted the Muslim Ottoman Empire eliminated and the Christian Byzantine Empire restored, and he hoped for the liberation of Balkan Slavs and their unification with the Russian Empire.

=== Ethnic beliefs ===
Many characters in Dostoevsky&#x27;s works, including Jews, have been described as displaying negative stereotypes. In an 1877 letter to Arkady Kovner, a Jew who had accused Dostoevsky of antisemitism, he replied with the following:&quot;I am not an enemy of the Jews at all and never have been. But as you say, its 40-century existence proves that this tribe has exceptional vitality, which would not help, during the course of its history, taking the form of various Status in Statu ... how can they fail to find themselves, even if only partially, at variance with the indigenous population – the Russian tribe?&quot;

Dostoevsky also was negative towards Poles, depicting them negatively, and harboring negative opinions towards them personally.

Dostoevsky held to a Pan-Slavic ideology that was conditioned by the Ottoman occupations of Eastern Europe. In 1876, the Slavic populations of modern-day South-Eastern Serbia outside of the Principality of Serbia (independent since 1868) and of the region of Bulgaria rose up against their Ottoman overlords, but the rebellion was put down. In the process, an estimated 12,000 people were killed. In his diaries, he scorned Westerners and those who were against the Pan-Slavic movement. This ideology was motivated in part by the desire to promote a common Orthodox Christian heritage, which he saw as both unifying as well as a force for liberation.

=== Religious beliefs ===
Dostoevsky was an Orthodox Christian who was raised in a religious family and knew the Gospel from a very young age. He was influenced by the Russian translation of Johannes Hübner&#x27;s &quot;One Hundred and Four Sacred Stories from the Old and New Testaments Selected for Children&quot; (partly a German bible for children and partly a catechism). He attended Sunday liturgies from an early age and took part in annual pilgrimages to the St. Sergius Trinity Monastery. A deacon at the hospital gave him religious instruction. Among his most cherished childhood memories were reciting prayers in front of guests and reading passages from the Book of Job that impressed him while &quot;still almost a child.&quot;

According to an officer at the military academy, Dostoevsky was profoundly religious, followed Orthodox practice, and regularly read the Gospels and Heinrich Zschokke&#x27;s (&quot;Hours of Devotion&quot;), which &quot;preached a sentimental version of Christianity entirely free from dogmatic content and with a strong emphasis on giving Christian love a social application.&quot; This book may have prompted his later interest in Christian socialism. Through the literature of Hoffmann, Balzac, Eugène Sue, and Goethe, Dostoevsky created his own belief system, similar to Russian sectarianism and the Old Belief. After his arrest, aborted execution, and subsequent imprisonment, he focused intensely on the figure of Christ and on the New Testament: the only book allowed in prison. In a January 1854 letter to the woman who had sent him the New Testament, Dostoevsky wrote that he was a &quot;child of unbelief and doubt up to this moment, and I am certain that I shall remain so to the grave.&quot; He also wrote that &quot;even if someone were to prove to me that the truth lay outside Christ, I should choose to remain with Christ rather than with the truth.&quot;

In Semipalatinsk, Dostoevsky revived his faith by looking frequently at the stars. Wrangel said that he was &quot;rather pious, but did not often go to church, and disliked priests, especially the Siberian ones. But he spoke about Christ ecstatically.&quot; Two pilgrimages and two works by Dmitri Rostovsky, an archbishop who influenced Ukrainian and Russian literature by composing groundbreaking religious plays, strengthened his beliefs. Through his visits to western Europe and discussions with Herzen, Grigoriev, and Strakhov, Dostoevsky discovered the &quot;Pochvennichestvo&quot; movement and the theory that the Catholic Church had adopted the principles of rationalism, legalism, materialism, and individualism from ancient Rome and had passed on its philosophy to Protestantism and consequently to atheistic socialism.

== Themes and style ==


Dostoevsky&#x27;s canon includes novels, novellas, novelettes, short stories, essays, pamphlets, limericks, epigrams and poems. He wrote more than 700 letters, a dozen of which are lost.

Dostoevsky expressed religious, psychological, and philosophical ideas in his writings. His works explore such themes as suicide, poverty, human manipulation, and morality. Psychological themes include dreaming, first seen in &quot;White Nights&quot;, and the father-son relationship, beginning in &quot;The Adolescent&quot;. Most of his works demonstrate a vision of the chaotic sociopolitical structure of contemporary Russia. His early works viewed society (for example, the differences between poor and rich) through the lens of literary realism and naturalism. The influences of other writers, particularly evident in his early works, led to accusations of plagiarism, but his style gradually became more individual. After his release from prison, Dostoevsky incorporated religious themes, especially those of Russian Orthodoxy, into his writing. Elements of gothic fiction, romanticism, and satire are observable in some of his books. He frequently used autobiographical or semi-autobiographical details.

An important stylistic element in Dostoevsky&#x27;s writing is polyphony, the simultaneous presence of multiple narrative voices and perspectives. Kornelije Kvas wrote that Bakhtin&#x27;s theory of &quot;the polyphonic novel and Dostoevsky&#x27;s dialogicness of narration postulates the non-existence of the &#x27;final&#x27; word, which is why the thoughts, emotions and experiences of the world of the narrator and his/her characters are reflected through the words of another, with which they can never fully blend.&quot;

== Legacy ==
=== Reception and influence ===
Dostoevsky is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential novelists of the Golden Age of Russian literature. Leo Tolstoy admired some of Dostoevsky&#x27;s works, particularly &quot;The House of the Dead&quot;, which he saw as exalted religious art, inspired by deep faith and love of humanity. Albert Einstein called Dostoevsky a &quot;great religious writer&quot; who explores &quot;the mystery of spiritual existence&quot;. Sigmund Freud ranked Dostoevsky second only to Shakespeare as a creative writer, and called &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; &quot;the most magnificent novel ever written&quot;. Friedrich Nietzsche called Dostoevsky &quot;the only psychologist from whom I had something to learn&quot; and described him as being &quot;among the most beautiful strokes of fortune in my life.&quot; The Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin&#x27;s analysis of Dostoevsky came to be at the foundation of his theory of the novel. Bakhtin argued that Dostoevsky&#x27;s use of polyphony was a major advancement in the development of the novel as a genre.

In his posthumous collection of sketches &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;, Ernest Hemingway stated that in Dostoevsky &quot;there were things believable and not to be believed, but some so true that they changed you as you read them; frailty and madness, wickedness and saintliness, and the insanity of gambling were there to know&quot;. James Joyce praised Dostoevsky&#x27;s prose: &quot;... he is the man more than any other who has created modern prose, and intensified it to its present-day pitch. It was his explosive power which shattered the Victorian novel with its simpering maidens and ordered commonplaces; books which were without imagination or violence.&quot; In her essay &quot;The Russian Point of View&quot;, Virginia Woolf said, &quot;Out of Shakespeare there is no more exciting reading&quot;. Franz Kafka called Dostoevsky his &quot;blood-relative&quot; and was heavily influenced by his works, particularly &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; and &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, both of which profoundly influenced &quot;The Trial&quot;. Hermann Hesse enjoyed Dostoevsky&#x27;s work and said that to read him is like a &quot;glimpse into the havoc&quot;. The Norwegian novelist Knut Hamsun wrote that &quot;no one has analyzed the complicated human structure as Dostoyevsky. His psychologic sense is overwhelming and visionary.&quot; Writers associated with cultural movements such as surrealism, existentialism and the Beats cite Dostoevsky as an influence, and he is regarded as a forerunner to Russian symbolism, expressionism and psychoanalysis.

J. M. Coetzee featured Dostoevsky as the protagonist in his 1997 novel &quot;The Master of Petersburg&quot;. The famous Malayalam novel &quot;Oru Sankeerthanam Pole&quot; by Perumbadavam Sreedharan deals with the life of Dostoevsky and his love affair with Anna.

=== Honours ===
In 1956 an olive-green postage stamp dedicated to Dostoevsky was released in the Soviet Union, with a print run of 1,000 copies. A Dostoevsky Museum was opened on 12 November 1971 in the apartment where he wrote his first and final novels. A crater on Mercury was named after him in 1979, and a minor planet discovered in 1981 by Lyudmila Karachkina was named 3453 Dostoevsky. Music critic and broadcaster Artemy Troitsky has hosted the radio show &quot;FM Достоевский&quot; (FM Dostoevsky) since 1997. Viewers of the TV show &quot;Name of Russia&quot; voted him the ninth greatest Russian of all time, just after Dmitry Mendeleev, and just ahead of ruler Ivan IV. An Eagle Award-winning TV series directed by Vladimir Khotinenko about Dostoevsky&#x27;s life was screened in 2011.

Numerous memorials were inaugurated in cities and regions such as Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Omsk, Semipalatinsk, Kusnetsk, Darovoye, Staraya Russa, Lyublino, Tallinn, Dresden, Baden-Baden and Wiesbaden. The Dostoyevskaya metro station in Saint Petersburg was opened on 30 December 1991, and the station of the same name in Moscow was opened on 19 June 2010, the 75th anniversary of the Moscow Metro. The Moscow station is decorated with murals by artist Ivan Nikolaev depicting scenes from Dostoevsky&#x27;s works, such as controversial suicides.

In 2021, Kazakhstan celebrated the 200th anniversary of Dostoevsky&#x27;s birth.

=== Criticism ===
Dostoevsky&#x27;s work did not always gain a positive reception. Some critics, such as Nikolay Dobrolyubov, Ivan Bunin and Vladimir Nabokov, viewed his writing as excessively psychological and philosophical rather than artistic. Others found fault with chaotic and disorganised plots, and others, like Turgenev, objected to &quot;excessive psychologising&quot; and too-detailed naturalism. His style was deemed &quot;prolix, repetitious and lacking in polish, balance, restraint and good taste&quot;. Saltykov-Shchedrin, Nikolay Mikhaylovsky and others criticised his puppet-like characters, most prominently in &quot;The Idiot&quot;, &quot;Demons&quot; (&quot;The Possessed&quot;, &quot;The Devils&quot;) and &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;. These characters were compared to those of Hoffmann, an author whom Dostoevsky admired.

Basing his estimation on stated criteria of enduring art and individual genius, Nabokov judges Dostoevsky &quot;not a great writer, but rather a mediocre one—with flashes of excellent humour but, alas, with wastelands of literary platitudes in between.&quot; Nabokov complains that the novels are peopled by &quot;neurotics and lunatics&quot; and states that Dostoevsky&#x27;s characters do not develop: &quot;We get them all complete at the beginning of the tale and so they remain.&quot; He finds the novels full of contrived &quot;surprises and complications of plot&quot;, which are effective when first read, but on second reading, without the shock and benefit of these surprises, appear loaded with &quot;glorified cliché&quot;. The Scottish poet and critic Edwin Muir, however, addressed criticism regarding the quality of Dostoevsky&#x27;s characters, noting that &quot;regarding the &#x27;oddness&#x27; of Dostoevsky&#x27;s characters, it has been pointed out that they perhaps only seem &#x27;pathological&#x27;, whereas in reality they are &#x27;only visualized more clearly than any figures in imaginative literature&#x27;.&quot;

=== Reputation ===
Dostoevsky&#x27;s books have been translated into more than 170 languages. The German translator Wilhelm Wolfsohn published one of the first translations, parts of &quot;Poor Folk&quot;, in an 1846–1847 magazine, and a French translation followed. French, German and Italian translations usually came directly from the original, while English translations were second-hand and of poor quality. The first English translations were by Marie von Thilo in 1881, but the first highly regarded ones were produced between 1912 and 1920 by Constance Garnett. Her flowing and easy translations helped popularise Dostoevsky&#x27;s novels in anglophone countries, and Bakhtin&#x27;s &quot;Problems of Dostoevsky&#x27;s Creative Art&quot; (1929) (republished and revised as &quot;Problems of Dostoevsky&#x27;s Poetics&quot; in 1963) provided further understanding of his style.

Dostoevsky&#x27;s works were interpreted in film and on stage in many different countries. Princess Varvara Dmitrevna Obolenskaya was among the first to propose staging &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;. Dostoevsky did not refuse permission, but he advised against it, as he believed that &quot;each art corresponds to a series of poetic thoughts, so that one idea cannot be expressed in another non-corresponding form&quot;. His extensive explanations in opposition to the transposition of his works into other media were groundbreaking in fidelity criticism. He thought that just one episode should be dramatised, or an idea should be taken and incorporated into a separate plot. According to critic Alexander Burry, some of the most effective adaptions are Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s opera &quot;The Gambler&quot;, Leoš Janáček&#x27;s opera &quot;From the House of the Dead&quot;, Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s film &quot;The Idiot&quot; and Andrzej Wajda&#x27;s film &quot;The Possessed&quot;.

After the 1917 Russian Revolution, passages of Dostoevsky books were sometimes shortened, although only two books were censored: &quot;Demons&quot; and &quot;Diary of a Writer&quot;. His philosophy, particularly in &quot;Demons&quot;, was deemed anti-capitalist but also anti-Communist and reactionary. According to historian Boris Ilizarov, Stalin read Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; several times.

== Works ==
Dostoevsky&#x27;s works of fiction include 16 novels and novellas, 16 short stories, and 5 translations. Many of his longer novels were first published in serialised form in literary magazines and journals. The years given below indicate the year in which the novel&#x27;s final part or first complete book edition was published. In English many of his novels and stories are known by different titles.

=== Major works ===
==== &quot;Poor Folk&quot; ====
&quot;Poor Folk&quot; is an epistolary novel that depicts the relationship between the small, elderly official Makar Devushkin and the young seamstress Varvara Dobroselova, remote relatives who write letters to each other. Makar&#x27;s tender, sentimental adoration for Varvara and her confident, warm friendship for him explain their evident preference for a simple life, although it keeps them in humiliating poverty. An unscrupulous merchant finds the inexperienced girl and hires her as his housewife and guarantor. He sends her to a manor somewhere on a steppe, while Makar alleviates his misery and pain with alcohol.

The story focuses on poor people who struggle with their lack of self-esteem. Their misery leads to the loss of their inner freedom, to dependence on the social authorities, and to the extinction of their individuality. Dostoevsky shows how poverty and dependence are indissolubly aligned with deflection and deformation of self-esteem, combining inward and outward suffering.

==== &quot;Notes from Underground&quot; ====
&quot;Notes from Underground&quot; is split into two stylistically different parts, the first essay-like, the second in narrative style. The protagonist and first-person narrator is an unnamed 40-year-old civil servant known as The Underground Man. The only known facts about his situation are that he has quit the service, lives in a basement flat on the outskirts of Saint Petersburg and finances his livelihood from a modest inheritance.

The first part is a record of his thoughts about society and his character. He describes himself as vicious, squalid and ugly; the chief focuses of his polemic are the &quot;modern human&quot; and his vision of the world, which he attacks severely and cynically, and towards which he develops aggression and vengefulness. He considers his own decline natural and necessary. Although he emphasises that he does not intend to publish his notes for the public, the narrator appeals repeatedly to an ill-described audience, whose questions he tries to address.

In the second part he describes scenes from his life that are responsible for his failure in personal and professional life and in his love life. He tells of meeting old school friends, who are in secure positions and treat him with condescension. His aggression turns inward on to himself and he tries to humiliate himself further. He presents himself as a possible saviour to the poor prostitute Liza, advising her to reject self-reproach when she looks to him for hope. Dostoevsky added a short commentary saying that although the storyline and characters are fictional, such things were inevitable in contemporary society.

The Underground Man was very influential for philosophers. His alienated existence from the mainstream influenced modernist literature.

==== &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; ====
The novel &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; has received both critical and popular acclaim. It remains one of the most influential and widely read novels in Russian literature, and has been sometimes described as Dostoevsky&#x27;s magnum opus.

&quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; follows the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who plans to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker, an old woman who stores money and valuable objects in her flat. He theorises that with the money he could liberate himself from poverty and go on to perform great deeds, and seeks to convince himself that certain crimes are justifiable if they are committed in order to remove obstacles to the higher goals of &#x27;extraordinary&#x27; men. Once the deed is done, however, he finds himself racked with confusion, paranoia, and disgust. His theoretical justifications lose all their power as he struggles with guilt and horror and confronts both the internal and external consequences of his deed.

Strakhov remarked that &quot;Only &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; was read in 1866&quot; and that Dostoevsky had managed to portray a Russian person aptly and realistically. In contrast, Grigory Eliseev of the radical magazine &quot;The Contemporary&quot; called the novel a &quot;fantasy according to which the entire student body is accused without exception of attempting murder and robbery&quot;. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; describes &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; as &quot;a masterpiece&quot; and &quot;one of the finest studies of the psychopathology of guilt written in any language.&quot;

==== &quot;The Idiot&quot; ====
The title is an ironic reference to the central character of the novel, Prince Lev Nikolayevich Myshkin, a young man whose goodness, open-hearted simplicity and guilelessness lead many of the more worldly characters he encounters to mistakenly assume that he lacks intelligence and insight. In the character of Prince Myshkin, Dostoevsky set himself the task of depicting &quot;the positively good and beautiful man.&quot; The novel examines the consequences of placing such a singular individual at the centre of the conflicts, desires, passions and egoism of worldly society, both for the man himself and for those with whom he becomes involved.

Joseph Frank describes &quot;The Idiot&quot; as &quot;the most personal of all Dostoevsky&#x27;s major works, the book in which he embodies his most intimate, cherished, and sacred convictions.&quot; It includes descriptions of some of his most intense personal ordeals, such as epilepsy and mock execution, and explores moral, spiritual and philosophical themes consequent upon them. His primary motivation in writing the novel was to subject his own highest ideal, that of true Christian love, to the crucible of contemporary Russian society.

==== &quot;Demons&quot; ====
&quot;Demons&quot; is a social and political satire, a psychological drama, and large-scale tragedy. Joyce Carol Oates has described it as &quot;Dostoevsky&#x27;s most confused and violent novel, and his most satisfactorily &#x27;tragic&#x27; work.&quot; According to Ronald Hingley, it is Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;greatest onslaught on Nihilism&quot;, and &quot;one of humanity&#x27;s most impressive achievements—perhaps even its supreme achievement—in the art of prose fiction.&quot;

&quot;Demons&quot; is an allegory of the potentially catastrophic consequences of the political and moral nihilism that were becoming prevalent in Russia in the 1860s. A fictional town descends into chaos as it becomes the focal point of an attempted revolution, orchestrated by master conspirator Pyotr Verkhovensky. The mysterious aristocratic figure of Nikolai Stavrogin—Verkhovensky&#x27;s counterpart in the moral sphere—dominates the book, exercising an extraordinary influence over the hearts and minds of almost all the other characters. The idealistic, Western-influenced generation of the 1840s, epitomized in the character of Stepan Verkhovensky (who is both Pyotr Verkhovensky&#x27;s father and Nikolai Stavrogin&#x27;s childhood teacher), is presented as the unconscious progenitors and helpless accomplices of the &quot;demonic&quot; forces that take possession of the town.

==== &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; ====
&quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; is Dostoevsky&#x27;s largest work. It received both critical and popular acclaim and is often cited as his &quot;magnum opus&quot;. Composed of 12 &quot;books&quot;, the novel tells the story of the novice Alyosha Karamazov, the non-believer Ivan Karamazov, and the soldier Dmitri Karamazov. The first books introduce the Karamazovs. The main plot is the death of their father Fyodor, while other parts are philosophical and religious arguments by Father Zosima to Alyosha.

The most famous chapter is &quot;The Grand Inquisitor&quot;, a parable told by Ivan to Alyosha about Christ&#x27;s Second Coming in Seville, Spain, in which Christ is imprisoned by a ninety-year-old Catholic Grand Inquisitor. Instead of answering him, Christ gives him a kiss, and the Inquisitor subsequently releases him, telling him not to return. The tale was misunderstood as a defence of the Inquisitor, but some, such as Romano Guardini, have argued that the Christ of the parable was Ivan&#x27;s own interpretation of Christ, &quot;the idealistic product of the unbelief&quot;. Ivan, however, has stated that he is against Christ. Most contemporary critics and scholars agree that Dostoevsky is attacking Roman Catholicism and socialist atheism, both represented by the Inquisitor. He warns the readers against a terrible revelation in the future, referring to the Donation of Pepin around 750 and the Spanish Inquisition in the 16th century, which in his view corrupted true Christianity.

Sigmund Freud wrote an essay called &quot;Dostoevsky and Parricide&quot; (German: Dostojewski und die Vatertötung) as an introductory article to a scholarly collection on &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;.

<doc id="11627" wikidata="Q1420463" url="?curid=11627" title="Faith healing">
<text>Faith healing is the practice of prayer and gestures (such as laying on of hands) that are believed by some to elicit divine intervention in spiritual and physical healing, especially the Christian practice. Believers assert that the healing of disease and disability can be brought about by religious faith through prayer or other rituals that, according to adherents, can stimulate a divine presence and power. Religious belief in divine intervention does not depend on empirical evidence of an evidence-based outcome achieved via faith healing. Virtually all scientists and philosophers dismiss faith healing as pseudoscience.

Claims that &quot;a myriad of techniques&quot; such as prayer, , or the ministrations of an individual healer can cure illness have been popular throughout history. There have been claims that faith can cure blindness, deafness, cancer, HIV/AIDS, developmental disorders, anemia, arthritis, corns, defective speech, multiple sclerosis, skin rashes, total body paralysis, and various injuries. Recoveries have been attributed to many techniques commonly classified as faith healing. It can involve prayer, a visit to a religious shrine, or simply a strong belief in a supreme being.

Many people interpret the Bible, especially the New Testament, as teaching belief in, and the practice of, faith healing. According to a 2004 &quot;Newsweek&quot; poll, 72 percent of Americans said they believe that praying to God can cure someone, even if science says the person has an incurable disease. Unlike faith healing, advocates of spiritual healing make no attempt to seek divine intervention, instead believing in divine energy. The increased interest in alternative medicine at the end of the 20th century has given rise to a parallel interest among sociologists in the relationship of religion to health.

Faith healing can be classified as a spiritual, supernatural, or paranormal topic, and, in some cases, belief in faith healing can be classified as magical thinking. The American Cancer Society states &quot;available scientific evidence does not support claims that faith healing can actually cure physical ailments&quot;. &quot;Death, disability, and other unwanted outcomes have occurred when faith healing was elected instead of medical care for serious injuries or illnesses.&quot; When parents have practiced faith healing but not medical care, many children have died that otherwise would have been expected to live. Similar results are found in adults.

==In various belief systems==

===Christianity===

====Overview====

Regarded as a Christian belief that God heals people through the power of the Holy Spirit, faith healing often involves the laying on of hands. It is also called supernatural healing, divine healing, and miracle healing, among other things. Healing in the Bible is often associated with the ministry of specific individuals including Elijah, Jesus and Paul.

Christian physician Reginald B. Cherry views faith healing as a pathway of healing in which God uses both the natural and the supernatural to heal. Being healed has been described as a privilege of accepting Christ&#x27;s redemption on the cross. Pentecostal writer Wilfred Graves Jr. views the healing of the body as a physical expression of salvation. , after describing Jesus exorcising at sunset and healing all of the sick who were brought to him, quotes these miracles as a fulfillment of the prophecy in : &quot;He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases&quot;.

Even those Christian writers who believe in faith healing do not all believe that one&#x27;s faith presently brings about the desired healing. &quot;[Y]our faith does not effect your healing now. When you are healed rests entirely on what the sovereign purposes of the Healer are.&quot; Larry Keefauver cautions against allowing enthusiasm for faith healing to stir up false hopes. &quot;Just believing hard enough, long enough or strong enough will not strengthen you or prompt your healing. Doing mental gymnastics to &#x27;hold on to your miracle&#x27; will not cause your healing to manifest now.&quot; Those who actively lay hands on others and pray with them to be healed are usually aware that healing may not always follow immediately. Proponents of faith healing say it may come later, and it may not come in this life. &quot;The truth is that your healing may manifest in eternity, not in time&quot;.

====New Testament====

Parts of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament say that Jesus cured physical ailments well outside the capacity of first-century medicine. Jesus&#x27; healing acts are considered miraculous and spectacular due to the results being impossible or statistically improbable. One example is the case of &quot;a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was not better but rather grew worse&quot;. After healing her, Jesus tells her &quot;Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace! Be cured from your illness&quot;. At least two other times Jesus credited the sufferer&#x27;s faith as the means of being healed: and .

Jesus endorsed the use of the medical assistance of the time (medicines of oil and wine) when he told the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25–37), who &quot;bound up [an injured man&#x27;s] wounds, pouring on oil and wine&quot; (verse 34) as a physician would. Jesus then told the doubting teacher of the law (who had elicited this parable by his self-justifying question, &quot;And who is my neighbor?&quot; in verse 29) to &quot;go, and do likewise&quot; in loving others with whom he would never ordinarily associate (verse 37).

The healing in the gospels is referred to as a &quot;sign&quot; to prove Jesus&#x27; divinity and to foster belief in him as the Christ. However, when asked for other types of miracles, Jesus refused some but granted others in consideration of the motive of the request. Some theologians&#x27; understanding is that Jesus healed &quot;all&quot; who were present every single time. Sometimes he determines whether they had faith that he would heal them. Four of the seven miraculous signs performed in the Fourth Gospel that indicated he was sent from God were acts of healing or resurrection. He heals the Capernaum official&#x27;s son, heals a paralytic by the pool in Bethsaida, healing a man born blind, and resurrecting Lazarus of Bethany.

Jesus told his followers to heal the sick and stated that signs such as healing are evidence of faith. Jesus also told his followers to &quot;cure sick people, raise up dead persons, make lepers clean, expel demons. You received free, give free&quot;.

Jesus sternly ordered many who received healing from him: &quot;Do not tell anyone!&quot; Jesus did not approve of anyone asking for a sign just for the spectacle of it, describing such as coming from a &quot;wicked and adulterous generation&quot;.

The apostle Paul believed healing is one of the special gifts of the Holy Spirit, and that the possibility exists that certain persons may possess this gift to an extraordinarily high degree.

In the New Testament Epistle of James, the faithful are told that to be healed, those who are sick should call upon the elders of the church to pray over [them] and anoint [them] with oil in the name of the Lord.

The New Testament says that during Jesus&#x27; ministry and after his Resurrection, the apostles healed the sick and cast out demons, made lame men walk, raised the dead and performed other miracles. Apostles were holy men who had direct access to God and could channel his power to help and heal people. For example, Saint Peter healed a disabled man.

Jesus used miracles to convince people that he was inaugurating the Messianic Age, as in Mt 12.28. Scholars have described Jesus&#x27; miracles as establishing the kingdom during his lifetime.

====Early Christian church====
Accounts or references to healing appear in the writings of many Ante Nicene Fathers, although many of these mentions are very general and do not include specifics.

====Catholicism====

The Roman Catholic Church recognizes two &quot;not mutually exclusive&quot; kinds of healing, one justified by science and one justified by faith:
* healing by human &quot;natural means through the practice of medicine&quot; which emphasizes that the theological virtue of &quot;charity demands that we not neglect natural means of healing people who are ill&quot; and the cardinal virtue of prudence forewarns not &quot;to employ a technique that has no scientific support (or even plausibility)&quot;
* healing by divine grace &quot;interceded on behalf of the sick through the invocation of the name of the Lord Jesus, asking for healing through the power of the Holy Spirit, whether in the form of the sacramental laying on of hands and anointing with oil or of simple prayers for healing, which often include an appeal to the saints for their aid&quot;

In 2000, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued &quot;Instruction on prayers for healing&quot; with specific norms about prayer meetings for obtaining healing, which presents the Catholic Church&#x27;s doctrines of sickness and healing.

It accepts &quot;that there may be means of natural healing that have not yet been understood or recognized by science&quot;, but it rejects superstitious practices which are neither compatible with Christian teaching nor compatible with scientific evidence.

Faith healing is reported by Catholics as the result of intercessory prayer to a saint or to a person with the gift of healing. According to &quot;U.S. Catholic&quot; magazine, &quot;Even in this skeptical, postmodern, scientific agemiracles really are possible.&quot; According to a &quot;Newsweek&quot; poll, three-fourths of American Catholics say they pray for &quot;miracles&quot; of some sort.

According to John Cavadini, when healing is granted, &quot;The miracle is not primarily for the person healed, but for all people, as a sign of God&#x27;s work in the ultimate healing called &#x27;salvation&#x27;, or a sign of the kingdom that is coming.&quot; Some might view their own healing as a sign they are particularly worthy or holy, while others do not deserve it.

The Catholic Church has a special Congregation dedicated to the careful investigation of the validity of alleged miracles attributed to prospective saints. Pope Francis tightened the rules on money and miracles in the canonization process. Since Catholic Christians believe the lives of canonized saints in the Church will reflect Christ&#x27;s, many have come to expect healing miracles. While the popular conception of a miracle can be wide-ranging, the Catholic Church has a specific definition for the kind of miracle formally recognized in a canonization process.

According to &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, it is often said that cures at shrines and during Christian pilgrimages are mainly due to psychotherapypartly to confident trust in Divine providence, and partly to the strong expectancy of cure that comes over suggestible persons at these times and places.

Among the best-known accounts by Catholics of faith healings are those attributed to the miraculous intercession of the apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary known as Our Lady of Lourdes at the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in France and the remissions of life-threatening disease claimed by those who have applied for aid to Saint Jude, who is known as the &quot;patron saint of lost causes&quot;.
, Catholic medics have asserted that there have been 67 miracles and 7,000 unexplainable medical cures at Lourdes since 1858. In a 1908 book, it says these cures were subjected to intense medical scrutiny and were only recognized as authentic spiritual cures after a commission of doctors and scientists, called the Lourdes Medical Bureau, had ruled out any physical mechanism for the patient&#x27;s recovery.

==== Evangelicalism ====

In some Pentecostal and Charismatic Evangelical churches, a special place is thus reserved for faith healings with laying on of hands during worship services or for campaigns evangelization. Faith healing or divine healing is considered to be an inheritance of Jesus acquired by his death and resurrection. Biblical inerrancy ensures that the miracles and healings described in the Bible are still relevant and may be present in the life of the believer.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the new Pentecostal movement drew participants from the Holiness movement and other movements in America that already believed in divine healing. By the 1930s, several faith healers drew large crowds and established worldwide followings.

The first Pentecostals in the modern sense appeared in Topeka, Kansas, in a Bible school conducted by Charles Fox Parham, a holiness teacher and former Methodist pastor. Pentecostalism achieved worldwide attention in 1906 through the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles led by William Joseph Seymour.

Smith Wigglesworth was also a well-known figure in the early part of the 20th century. A former English plumber turned evangelist who lived simply and read nothing but the Bible from the time his wife taught him to read, Wigglesworth traveled around the world preaching about Jesus and performing faith healings. Wigglesworth claimed to raise several people from the dead in Jesus&#x27; name in his meetings.

During the 1920s and 1930s, Aimee Semple McPherson was a controversial faith healer of growing popularity during the Great Depression. Subsequently, William M. Branham has been credited as the initiator of the post-World War II healing revivals. The healing revival he began led many to emulate his style and spawned a generation of faith healers. Because of this, Branham has been recognized as the &quot;father of modern faith healers&quot;. According to writer and researcher Patsy Sims, &quot;the power of a Branham service and his stage presence remains a legend unparalleled in the history of the Charismatic movement&quot;. By the late 1940s, Oral Roberts, who was associated with and promoted by Branham&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Healing&quot; magazine also became well known, and he continued with faith healing until the 1980s. Roberts discounted faith healing in the late 1950s, stating, &quot;I never was a faith healer and I was never raised that way. My parents believed very strongly in medical science and we have a doctor who takes care of our children when they get sick. I cannot heal anyone – God does that.&quot; A friend of Roberts was Kathryn Kuhlman, another popular faith healer, who gained fame in the 1950s and had a television program on CBS. Also in this era, Jack Coe and A. A. Allen were faith healers who traveled with large tents for large open-air crusades.

Oral Roberts&#x27;s successful use of television as a medium to gain a wider audience led others to follow suit. His former pilot, Kenneth Copeland, started a healing ministry. Pat Robertson, Benny Hinn, and Peter Popoff became well-known televangelists who claimed to heal the sick. Richard Rossi is known for advertising his healing clinics through secular television and radio. Kuhlman influenced Benny Hinn, who adopted some of her techniques and wrote a book about her.

====Christian Science====
Christian Science claims that healing is possible through prayer based on an understanding of God and the underlying spiritual perfection of God&#x27;s creation. The material world as humanly perceived is believed to not be the spiritual reality. Christian Scientists believe that healing through prayer is possible insofar as it succeeds in bringing the spiritual reality of health into human experience. Prayer does not change the spiritual creation but gives a clearer view of it, and the result appears in the human scene as healing: the human picture adjusts to coincide more nearly with the divine reality. Therefore, Christian Scientists do not consider themselves to be faith healers since faith or belief in Christian Science is not required on the part of the patient, and because they consider healings reliable and provable rather than random.

Although there is no hierarchy in Christian Science, practitioners devote full time to prayer for others on a professional basis, and advertise in an online directory published by the church. Christian Scientists sometimes tell their stories of healing at weekly testimony meetings at local Christian Science churches, or publish them in the church&#x27;s magazines including &quot;The Christian Science Journal&quot; printed monthly since 1883, the &quot;Christian Science Sentinel&quot; printed weekly since 1898, and &quot;The Herald of Christian Science&quot; a foreign language magazine beginning with a German edition in 1903 and later expanding to Spanish, French, and Portuguese editions. Christian Science Reading Rooms often have archives of such healing accounts.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) has had a long history of faith healings. Many members of the LDS Church have told their stories of healing within the LDS publication, the &quot;Ensign&quot;. The church believes healings come most often as a result of priesthood blessings given by the laying on of hands; however, prayer often accompanied with fasting is also thought to cause healings. Healing is always attributed to be God&#x27;s power. Latter-day Saints believe that the Priesthood of God, held by prophets (such as Moses) and worthy disciples of the Savior, was restored via heavenly messengers to the first prophet of this dispensation, Joseph Smith.

According to LDS doctrine, even though members may have the restored priesthood authority to heal in the name of Jesus Christ, all efforts should be made to seek the appropriate medical help. Brigham Young stated this effectively, while also noting that the ultimate outcome is still dependent on the will of God.

===Islam===

A number of healing traditions exist among Muslims. Some healers are particularly focused on diagnosing cases of possession by jinn or demons.

===Buddhism===
Chinese-born Australian businessman Jun Hong Lu was a prominent proponent of the &quot;Guan Yin Citta Dharma Door&quot;, claiming that practicing the three &quot;golden practices&quot; of reciting texts and mantras, liberation of beings, and making vows, laid a solid foundation for improved physical, mental, and psychological well-being, with many followers publicly attesting to have been healed through practice.

===Scientology===
Some critics of Scientology have referred to some of its practices as being similar to faith healing, based on claims made by L. Ron Hubbard in &quot;&quot; and other writings.

==Scientific investigation==
Nearly all scientists dismiss faith healing as pseudoscience. Believers assert that faith healing makes no scientific claims and thus should be treated as a matter of faith that is not testable by science. Critics reply that claims of medical cures should be tested scientifically because, although faith in the supernatural is not in itself usually considered to be the purview of science, claims of reproducible effects are nevertheless subject to scientific investigation.

Scientists and doctors generally find that faith healing lacks biological plausibility or epistemic warrant, which is one of the criteria used to judge whether clinical research is ethical and financially justified. A Cochrane review of intercessory prayer found &quot;although some of the results of individual studies suggest a positive effect of intercessory prayer, the majority do not&quot;. The authors concluded: &quot;We are not convinced that further trials of this intervention should be undertaken and would prefer to see any resources available for such a trial used to investigate other questions in health care&quot;.

A review in 1954 investigated spiritual healing, therapeutic touch and faith healing. Of the hundred cases reviewed, none revealed that the healer&#x27;s intervention alone resulted in any improvement or cure of a measurable organic disability.

In addition, at least one study has suggested that adult Christian Scientists, who generally use prayer rather than medical care, have a higher death rate than other people of the same age.

The Global Medical Research Institute (GMRI) was created in 2012 to start collecting medical records of patients who claim to have received a supernatural healing miracle as a result of Christian Spiritual Healing practices. The organization has a panel of medical doctors who review the patient&#x27;s records looking at entries prior to the claimed miracles and entries after the miracle was claimed to have taken place. &quot;The overall goal of GMRI is to promote an empirically grounded understanding of the physiological, emotional, and sociological effects of Christian Spiritual Healing practices&quot;. This is accomplished by applying the same rigorous standards used in other forms of medical and scientific research.

A 2011 article in the New Scientist magazine cited positive physical results from meditation, positive thinking and spiritual faith

==Criticism==
Skeptics of faith healing offer primarily two explanations for anecdotes of cures or improvements, relieving any need to appeal to the supernatural. The first is &quot;post hoc ergo propter hoc&quot;, meaning that a genuine improvement or spontaneous remission may have been experienced coincidental with but independent from anything the faith healer or patient did or said. These patients would have improved just as well even had they done nothing. The second is the placebo effect, through which a person may experience genuine pain relief and other symptomatic alleviation. In this case, the patient genuinely has been helped by the faith healer or faith-based remedy, not through any mysterious or numinous function, but by the power of their own belief that they would be healed. In both cases the patient may experience a real reduction in symptoms, though in neither case has anything miraculous or inexplicable occurred. Both cases, however, are strictly limited to the body&#x27;s natural abilities.

According to the American Cancer Society:
The American Medical Association considers that prayer as therapy should not be a medically reimbursable or deductible expense.

Belgian philosopher and skeptic Etienne Vermeersch coined the term Lourdes effect as a criticism of the magical thinking and placebo effect possibilities for the claimed miraculous cures as there are no documented events where a severed arm has been reattached through faith healing at Lourdes. Vermeersch identifies ambiguity and equivocal nature of the miraculous cures as a key feature of miraculous events.

===Negative impact on public health===
Reliance on faith healing to the exclusion of other forms of treatment can have a public health impact when it reduces or eliminates access to modern medical techniques. This is evident in both higher mortality rates for children and in reduced life expectancy for adults. Critics have also made note of serious injury that has resulted from falsely labelled &quot;healings&quot;, where patients erroneously consider themselves cured and cease or withdraw from treatment. For example, at least six people have died after faith healing by their church and being told they had been healed of HIV and could stop taking their medications. It is the stated position of the AMA that &quot;prayer as therapy should not delay access to traditional medical care&quot;. Choosing faith healing while rejecting modern medicine can and does cause people to die needlessly.

===Christian theological criticism of faith healing===
Christian theological criticism of faith healing broadly falls into two distinct levels of disagreement.

The first is widely termed the &quot;open-but-cautious&quot; view of the miraculous in the church today. This term is deliberately used by Robert L. Saucy in the book &quot;Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?&quot;. Don Carson is another example of a Christian teacher who has put forward what has been described as an &quot;open-but-cautious&quot; view. In dealing with the claims of Warfield, particularly &quot;Warfield&#x27;s insistence that miracles ceased&quot;, Carson asserts, &quot;But this argument stands up only if such miraculous gifts are theologically tied exclusively to a role of attestation; and that is demonstrably not so.&quot; However, while affirming that he does not expect healing to happen today, Carson is critical of aspects of the faith healing movement, &quot;Another issue is that of immense abuses in healing practises... The most common form of abuse is the view that since all illness is directly or indirectly attributable to the devil and his works, and since Christ by his cross has defeated the devil, and by his Spirit has given us the power to overcome him, healing is the inheritance right of all true Christians who call upon the Lord with genuine faith.&quot;

The second level of theological disagreement with Christian faith healing goes further. Commonly referred to as cessationism, its adherents either claim that faith healing will not happen today at all, or may happen today, but it would be unusual. Richard Gaffin argues for a form of cessationism in an essay alongside Saucy&#x27;s in the book &quot;Are Miraculous Gifts for Today&quot;? In his book &quot;Perspectives on Pentecost&quot; Gaffin states of healing and related gifts that &quot;the conclusion to be drawn is that as listed in 1 Corinthians 12(vv. 9f., 29f.) and encountered throughout the narrative in Acts, these gifts, particularly when exercised regularly by a given individual, are part of the foundational structure of the church... and so have passed out of the life of the church.&quot; Gaffin qualifies this, however, by saying &quot;At the same time, however, the sovereign will and power of God today to heal the sick, particularly in response to prayer (see e.g. James 5:14, 15), ought to be acknowledged and insisted on.&quot;

According to the Catholic apologist Trent Horn, while the Bible teaches believers to pray when they are sick, this is not to be viewed as an exclusion of medical care, citing Sirach 38:9,12-14:

===Fraud===
Skeptics of faith healers point to fraudulent practices either in the healings themselves (such as plants in the audience with fake illnesses), or concurrent with the healing work supposedly taking place and claim that faith healing is a quack practice in which the &quot;healers&quot; use well known non-supernatural illusions to exploit credulous people in order to obtain their gratitude, confidence and money. James Randi&#x27;s &quot;The Faith Healers&quot; investigates Christian evangelists such as Peter Popoff, who claimed to heal sick people on stage in front of an audience. Popoff pretended to know private details about participants&#x27; lives by receiving radio transmissions from his wife who was off-stage and had gathered information from audience members prior to the show. According to this book, many of the leading modern evangelistic healers have engaged in deception and fraud. The book also questioned how faith healers use funds that were sent to them for specific purposes. Physicist Robert L. Park and doctor and consumer advocate Stephen Barrett have called into question the ethics of some exorbitant fees.

There have also been legal controversies. For example, in 1955 at a Jack Coe revival service in Miami, Florida, Coe told the parents of a three-year-old boy that he healed their son who had polio. Coe then told the parents to remove the boy&#x27;s leg braces. However, their son was not cured of polio and removing the braces left the boy in constant pain. As a result, through the efforts of Joseph L. Lewis, Coe was arrested and charged on February 6, 1956, with practicing medicine without a license, a felony in the state of Florida. A Florida Justice of the Peace dismissed the case on grounds that Florida exempts divine healing from the law. Later that year Coe was diagnosed with bulbar polio, and died a few weeks later at Dallas&#x27; Parkland Hospital on December 17, 1956.

===Miracles for sale===
TV personality Derren Brown produced a show on faith healing entitled &quot;Miracles for Sale&quot; which arguably exposed the art of faith healing as a scam. In this show, Derren trained a scuba diver trainer picked from the general public to be a faith healer and took him to Texas to successfully deliver a faith healing session to a congregation.

==United States law==
The 1974 Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) required states to grant religious exemptions to child neglect and child abuse laws in order to receive federal money. The CAPTA amendments of 1996 state:

Thirty-one states have child-abuse religious exemptions. These are Alabama, Alaska, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming. In six of these states, Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Ohio and Virginia, the exemptions extend to murder and manslaughter. Of these, Idaho is the only state accused of having a large number of deaths due to the legislation in recent times. In February 2015, controversy was sparked in Idaho over a bill believed to further reinforce parental rights to deny their children medical care.

===Manslaughter and homicide convictions===
Parents of an 11-year-old girl were convicted of child abuse and felony reckless negligent homicide and found responsible for killing their children when they withheld lifesaving medical care and chose only prayers.

Parents of an 8-year-old girl in Australia and 12 members of their religious sect were found guilty of manslaughter for withholding lifesaving medication. Members of the sect sang and prayed rather than seeking medical help.

<text>Friedrich Christian Anton Lang (; December 5, 1890 – August 2, 1976), better known as Fritz Lang (), was an Austrian-born film director, screenwriter, and producer who worked in Germany and later the United States. One of the best-known &quot;émigrés&quot; from Germany&#x27;s school of Expressionism, he was dubbed the &quot;Master of Darkness&quot; by the British Film Institute. He has been cited as one of the most influential filmmakers of all time.

Lang&#x27;s work spans five decades, from the Expressionist silent films of his first German creative period to his short stay in Paris and his work as a Hollywood director to his last three films made in Germany. Lang&#x27;s most celebrated films include the futuristic science-fiction film &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927) and the influential &quot;M&quot; (1931), a film noir precursor. His 1929 film &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot; showcased the use of a multi-stage rocket, and also pioneered the concept of a rocket launch pad (a rocket standing upright against a tall building before launch having been slowly rolled into place) and the rocket-launch countdown clock.

His other major films include &quot;Dr. Mabuse the Gambler&quot; (1922), &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot; (1924), and after moving to Hollywood in 1934, &quot;Fury&quot; (1936), &quot;You Only Live Once&quot; (1937), &quot;Hangmen Also Die!&quot; (1943), &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot; (1944), &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Big Heat&quot; (1953). He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1939.

==Early life==
Lang was born in Vienna, as the second son of Anton Lang (1860–1940), an architect and construction company manager, and his wife Pauline &quot;Paula&quot; Lang ( Schlesinger; 1864–1920). There is no documented evidence of the true identity of Anton Lang&#x27;s biological father; he was born as an illegitimate child of a maid from Moravia. Anton Lang was described as a &quot;lapsed Catholic,&quot; and was a builder and partner in Honus and Lang, an important construction company Pauline Lang was born Jewish and converted to Catholicism. Fritz Lang was baptized on December 28, 1890, at the Schottenkirche in Vienna. He had an elder brother, Adolf (1884–1961).&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan/Lang/ONE&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Lang&#x27;s father was of Moravian descent. At one point, he noted that he was “born [a] Catholic and very puritan&quot;. Ultimately describing himself as an atheist, Lang believed that religion was important for teaching ethics.

After finishing school, Lang briefly attended the Technical University of Vienna, where he studied civil engineering and eventually switched to art. He left Vienna in 1910 to travel throughout Europe and Africa, later Asia and the Pacific area. In 1913, he studied painting in Paris. He was arrested by the French authorities as an “enemy alien,” but escaped to Vienna, where he was drafted into the Imperial Austrian Army.

At the outbreak of World War I, Lang returned to Vienna and volunteered for military service in the Austrian Army, fighting in Russia and Romania. Lang was wounded four times and lost sight in his right eye, when he then saw a Max Reinhardt show for injured soldiers and played in a Red Cross revue. During his convalescence he began writing plays and simple scenarios with Austrian film director Joe May devising a two-reel film from a Lang scenario. At the end of the war, Lang began to mingle with the demobilized Berlin artists and was discharged from the army with the rank of lieutenant in 1918. Lang briefly acted in the Viennese theater circuit before being hired as a writer at Decla Film, Erich Pommer&#x27;s Berlin-based production company.

On 13 February 1919, in the Marriage Registry Office in Charlottenburg, Berlin, Lang married a theater actress named Elisabeth Rosenthal. Rosenthal died of a single gunshot wound in their bathtub on September 25, 1920, the shot&lt;ref name=&quot;slant/mcgilligan-lang&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; deemed to have been fired by Lang&#x27;s World War I Browning revolver&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian/2001/feb/10/book.review&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Lang and his future wife Harbou claimed that Rosenthal had shot herself, and Lang and Harbou were charged with failure to render aid. The charge was soon dropped.

== Career ==
===Expressionist films: the Weimar years (1918–1933)===
Lang started work as a director at the German film studio UFA, and later Nero-Film, just as the Expressionist movement was building. In this first phase of his career, Lang alternated between films such as &quot;Der Müde Tod&quot; (&quot;The Weary Death&quot;) and popular thrillers such as &quot;Die Spinnen&quot; (&quot;The Spiders&quot;), combining popular genres with Expressionist techniques to create a synthesis of popular entertainment with art cinema.

In 1920, Lang met his future second wife, the writer Thea von Harbou through director Joe May. Harbou co-wrote and directed the film “Das wandernde Bild” with Lang. She co-wrote every Harbou Lang film till 1933, including &quot;Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler&quot; (&quot;Dr. Mabuse the Gambler,&quot; 1922 – which ran for over four hours, in two parts in the original version, and was the first in the Dr. Mabuse trilogy), the five-hour &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot; (1924), the dystopian film &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927), and the science fiction film &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot; (1929). &quot;Metropolis&quot; went over budget, to the UFA&#x27;s detriment. It was a financial flop, as were his last silent films &quot;Spies&quot; (1928) and &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot;, produced by Lang&#x27;s own company.

In 1931, independent producer Seymour Nebenzahl hired Lang to direct &quot;M&quot; for Nero-Film. His first &quot;talking&quot; picture, considered by many film scholars to be a masterpiece of the early sound era, &quot;M&quot; is a story of a child murderer (Peter Lorre in his first starring role) who is hunted down and brought to justice by Berlin&#x27;s criminal underworld. 

Lang was hard to work with. During the climactic final scene in &quot;M&quot;, Lang allegedly threw Peter Lorre down a flight of stairs in order to give more authenticity to Lorre&#x27;s battered look. 

In the films of his German period, Lang produced an oeuvre that established the characteristics later attributed to film noir, with its recurring themes of psychological conflict, paranoia, fate and moral ambiguity.

Lang started having an affair with the Austrian actress Gerda Maurus during the filming of Spione(1928).

At the end of 1932, Lang started filming &quot;The Testament of Dr. Mabuse&quot;. As Adolf Hitler came to power in January 1933, the new regime banned the film on March 30th as an incitement to public disorder. &quot;Testament&quot; is occasionally deemed an anti-Nazi film, as Lang had put Nazi phrases into the mouth of the title character. A screening of the film was cancelled by Joseph Goebbels, and it was later banned by the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. In banning the film, Goebbels stated that the film &quot;showed that an extremely dedicated group of people are perfectly capable of overthrowing any state with violence&quot;, and that the film posed a threat to public health and safety.

 Throughout his marriage with Harbou, Lang was known for being a philander and his affairs. Two of his lovers of these years included Gerda Maurus, the leading actress in Lang&#x27;s last silent films Spione(1928) and Woman in the Moon(1929), and Lily Latte in 1931. In the early 1930s, Harbou started an affair with Ayi Tendulkar, an Indian journalist and student 17 years younger than him. 

===Emigration===
According to Lang, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels called Lang to his offices to inform him that &quot;The Testament of Dr. Mabuse&quot; was being banned but, nevertheless, he was so impressed by Lang&#x27;s abilities as a filmmaker (especially &quot;Metropolis&quot;), that he offered Lang the position of head of German film studio UFA. Lang said it was during that meeting he had decided to leave for Paris – but that the banks had closed by the time the meeting was over. Lang claimed that, after selling his wife&#x27;s jewelry, he fled by train to Paris that evening, leaving most of his money and personal possessions behind. Despite this, Lang&#x27;s passport of the time showed that he traveled to and from Germany throughout 1933.

Lang left Berlin permanently on July 31, 1933, four months after his meeting with Goebbels and his initial departure. He moved to Paris, having divorced Thea von Harbou, who stayed behind, earlier in 1933.

In Paris, Lang filmed his only French film, a version of Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s &quot;Liliom&quot;, starring Charles Boyer. He then moved to the United States.

=== Hollywood career (1936–1957) ===
Lang made twenty-two features in his 20-year American career, working in a variety of genres at every major studio in Hollywood, and occasionally producing his films as an independent. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1939.

Signing first with MGM Studios, Lang&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Fury&quot; (1936) saw Spencer Tracy cast as a man who is wrongly accused of a crime and nearly killed when a lynch mob sets fire to the jail where he is awaiting trial. However, in &quot;Fury&quot;, he was not allowed to represent black victims in a lynching scenario or to criticize racism, which was his original intention. By the time &quot;Fury&quot; was released, Lang had been involved in the creation of the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League, working with Otto Katz, a Czech who was a Comintern spy. He made four films with an explicitly anti-Nazi themes, &quot;Man Hunt&quot; (1941), &quot;Hangmen Also Die!&quot; (1943), &quot;Ministry of Fear&quot; (1944) and &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot; (1946). &quot;Man Hunt&quot;, wrote Dave Kehr in 2009, &quot;may be the best&quot; of the &quot;many interventionist films produced by the Hollywood studios before Pearl Harbor&quot; as it is &quot;clean and concentrated, elegant and precise, pointed without being preachy.&quot;
His American films were often compared unfavorably to his earlier works by contemporary critics, although the restrained Expressionism of these films is now seen as integral to the emergence and evolution of American genre cinema. &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; (1945), one of his films featuring Edward G. Robinson and Joan Bennett, is considered a central film in the film noir genre.

One of Lang&#x27;s most praised &quot;films noir&quot; is the police drama &quot;The Big Heat&quot; (1953), known for its brutality. As Lang&#x27;s visual style simplified, in part due to the constraints of the Hollywood studio system, his worldview became increasingly pessimistic, culminating in the cold, geometric style of his last American films, &quot;While the City Sleeps&quot; (1956) and &quot;Beyond a Reasonable Doubt&quot; (1956).

===Last films (1959–1963)===
Lang, as his health worsened with age, found it difficult to find congenial production conditions and backers in Hollywood and contemplated retirement. The German producer Artur Brauner had expressed interest in remaking &quot;The Indian Tomb&quot; (from an original story by Thea von Harbou, that Lang had developed in the 1920s which had ultimately been directed by Joe May), so Lang returned to Germany to make his &quot;Indian Epic&quot; (consisting of &quot;The Tiger of Eschnapur&quot; and &quot;The Indian Tomb&quot;).

Following the production, Brauner was preparing for a remake of &quot;The Testament of Dr. Mabuse&quot; when Lang approached him with the idea of adding a new original film to the series. The result was &quot;The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse&quot; (1960), whose success led to a series of new Mabuse films produced by Brauner (including the remake of &quot;The Testament of Dr. Mabuse&quot;), though Lang did not direct any of the sequels. Lang was approaching blindness during the production, and it was his final project as director.

In 1963, he appeared as himself in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s film &quot;Contempt&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
On February 8, 1960, Lang received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion picture industry, located at 1600 Vine Street.
Lang died from a stroke on August 2, 1976, and was interred in the Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills Cemetery in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles.

Lang&#x27;s American and later German works were championed by the critics of the &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;, such as François Truffaut and Jacques Rivette. Truffaut wrote that Lang, especially in his American career, was greatly underappreciated by &quot;cinema historians and critics&quot; who &quot;deny him any genius when he &#x27;signs&#x27; spy movies ... war movies ... or simple thrillers.&quot; 

Lang is credited with launching or developing many different genres of film. Philip French of &quot;The Observer&quot; believed that Lang helped craft the &quot;entertainment war flick&quot; and that his interpretation of the story of Bonnie and Clyde &quot;helped launch the Hollywood film noir&quot;. Geoff Andrew of the British Film Institute believed he set the &quot;blueprint for the serial killer movie&quot; through &quot;M&quot;.

In December 2021, Lang was the subject for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;In Our Time&quot;.

===Preservation===
The Academy Film Archive has preserved a number of Lang&#x27;s films, including &quot;Human Desire&quot; and &quot;Man Hunt&quot;.

<text>The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA or US FDA) is a federal agency of the Department of Health and Human Services. The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the control and supervision of food safety, tobacco products, caffeine products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs (medications), vaccines, biopharmaceuticals, blood transfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices (ERED), cosmetics, animal foods &amp; feed and veterinary products.

The FDA&#x27;s primary focus is enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C). However, the agency also enforces other laws, notably Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act as well as associated regulations. Much of this regulatory-enforcement work is not directly related to food or drugs but involves other factors like regulating lasers, cellular phones, and condoms. In addition, the FDA takes control of diseases in the contexts varying from household pets to human sperm donated for use in assisted reproduction.

The FDA is led by the commissioner of food and drugs, appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate. The commissioner reports to the secretary of health and human services. Sara Brenner is the current acting commissioner as of January 24, 2025, following the resignation of Commissioner Robert Califf on January 20, 2025.

The FDA&#x27;s headquarters is located in the White Oak area of Silver Spring, Maryland. The agency has 223 field offices and 13 laboratories located across the 50 states, the United States Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. In 2008, the FDA began to post employees to foreign countries, including China, India, Costa Rica, Chile, Belgium, and the United Kingdom.

==Location==
=== Headquarters ===
FDA headquarters facilities are currently located in Montgomery County and Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland.

=== White Oak Federal Research Center ===
Since 1990, the FDA has had employees and facilities on of the White Oak Federal Research Center in the White Oak area of Silver Spring, Maryland. In 2001, the General Services Administration (GSA) began new construction on the campus to consolidate the FDA&#x27;s 25 existing operations in the Washington metropolitan area, its headquarters in Rockville, and several fragmented office buildings. The first building, the Life Sciences Laboratory, was dedicated and opened with 104 employees in December 2003. the FDA campus has a population of 10,987 employees housed in approximately of space, divided into ten offices and four laboratory buildings. The campus houses the Office of the Commissioner (OC), the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA),  the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and offices for the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM).

With the passing of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA projects a 64% increase in employees to 18,000 over the next 15 years and wants to add approximately of office and special use space to their existing facilities. The National Capital Planning Commission approved a new master plan for this expansion in December 2018, and construction is expected to be completed by 2035, dependent on GSA appropriations.

===Field locations===
==== Office of Regulatory Affairs ====
The Office of Regulatory Affairs is considered the agency&#x27;s &quot;eyes and ears&quot;, conducting the vast majority of the FDA&#x27;s work in the field. Its employees, known as Consumer Safety Officers, or more commonly known simply as investigators, inspect production, warehousing facilities, investigate complaints, illnesses, or outbreaks, and review documentation in the case of medical devices, drugs, biological products, and other items where it may be difficult to conduct a physical examination or take a physical sample of the product. The Office of Regulatory Affairs is divided into five regions, which are further divided into 20 districts. The districts are based roughly on the geographic divisions of the Federal court system. Each district comprises a main district office and a number of Resident Posts, which are FDA remote offices that serve a particular geographic area. ORA also includes the Agency&#x27;s network of regulatory laboratories, which analyze any physical samples taken. Though samples are usually food-related, some laboratories are equipped to analyze drugs, cosmetics, and radiation-emitting devices.

==== Office of Criminal Investigations ====

The Office of Criminal Investigations was established in 1991 to investigate criminal cases. To do so, OCI employs approximately 200 Special Agents nationwide who, unlike ORA Investigators, are armed, have badges, and do not focus on technical aspects of the regulated industries. Rather, OCI agents pursue and develop cases when individuals and companies commit criminal actions, such as fraudulent claims or knowingly and willfully shipping known adulterated goods in interstate commerce. In many cases, OCI pursues cases involving violations of Title 18 of the United States Code (e.g., conspiracy, false statements, wire fraud, mail fraud), in addition to prohibited acts as defined in Chapter III of the FD&amp;C Act. OCI Special Agents often come from other criminal investigations backgrounds, and frequently work closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Assistant Attorney General, and even Interpol. OCI receives cases from a variety of sources—including ORA, local agencies, and the FBI, and works with ORA Investigators to help develop the technical and science-based aspects of a case.

==== Other locations ====
The FDA has a number of field offices across the United States, in addition to international locations in China, India, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America.

==Scope and funding==
As of 2021, the FDA had responsibility for overseeing $2.7 trillion in food, medical, and tobacco products. Some 54% of its budget derives from the federal government, and 46% is covered by industry user fees for FDA services. For example, pharmaceutical firms pay fees to expedite drug reviews.

According to Forbes, pharmaceutical firms provide 75% of the FDA&#x27;s drug review budget.

==Regulatory programs==
===Emergency approvals (EUA)===

Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism that was created to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines and personal protective equipment, during public health emergencies such as the Zika virus epidemic, the Ebola virus epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Regulations===
The programs for safety regulation vary widely by the type of product, its potential risks, and the regulatory powers granted to the agency. For example, the FDA regulates almost every facet of prescription drugs, including testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing, efficacy, and safety—yet FDA regulation of cosmetics focuses primarily on labeling and safety. The FDA regulates most products with a set of published standards enforced by a modest number of facility inspections. Inspection observations are documented on Form 483.

In June 2018, the FDA released a statement regarding new guidelines to help food and drug manufacturers &quot;implement protections against potential attacks on the U.S. food supply&quot;. One of the guidelines includes the Intentional Adulteration (IA) rule, which requires strategies and procedures by the food industry to reduce the risk of compromise in facilities and processes that are significantly vulnerable.

The FDA also uses tactics of regulatory shaming, mainly through online publication of non-compliance, warning letters, and &quot;shaming lists.&quot; Regulation by shaming harnesses firms&#x27; sensitivity to reputational damage. For example, in 2018, the agency published an online &quot;black list&quot;, in which it named dozens of branded drug companies that are supposedly using unlawful or unethical means to attempt to impede competition from generic drug companies.

The FDA frequently works with other federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs and Border Protection, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. They also often work with local and state government agencies in performing regulatory inspections and enforcement actions.

===Food and dietary supplements===

The regulation of food and dietary supplements by the Food and Drug Administration is governed by various statutes enacted by the United States Congress and interpreted by the FDA. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and accompanying legislation, the FDA has authority to oversee the quality of substances sold as food in the United States, and to monitor claims made in the labeling of both the composition and the health benefits of foods.

The FDA subdivides substances that it regulates as food into various categories—including foods, food additives, added substances (human-made substances that are not intentionally introduced into food, but nevertheless end up in it), and dietary supplements. Dietary supplements or dietary ingredients include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and enzymes. Specific standards the FDA exercises differ from one category to the next. Furthermore, legislation had granted the FDA a variety of means to address violations of standards for a given substance category.

Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), the FDA is responsible for ensuring that manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients meet the current requirements. These manufacturers and distributors are not allowed to advertise their products in an adulterated way, and they are responsible for evaluating the safety and labeling of their product.

The FDA has a &quot;Dietary Supplement Ingredient Advisory List&quot; that includes ingredients that sometimes appear on dietary supplements but need further evaluation. An ingredient is added to this list when it is excluded from use in a dietary supplement, does not appear to be an approved food additive or recognized as safe, and/or is subjected to the requirement for pre-market notification without having a satisfied requirement.

====&quot;FDA-Approved&quot; vs. &quot;FDA-Accepted in Food Processing&quot;====
The FDA does not approve applied coatings used in the food processing industry. There is no review process to approve the composition of nonstick coatings; nor does the FDA inspect or test these materials. Through their governing of processes, however, the FDA does have a set of regulations that cover the formulation, manufacturing, and use of nonstick coatings. Hence, materials like Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) are not and cannot be considered as FDA Approved, but rather, they are a &quot;FDA Compliant&quot; or &quot;FDA Acceptable&quot;.

===Medical countermeasures (MCMs)===

Medical countermeasures (MCMs) are products such as biologics and pharmaceutical drugs that can protect from or treat the health effects of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) attack. MCMs can also be used for prevention and diagnosis of symptoms associated with CBRN attacks or threats. The FDA runs a program called the &quot;FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative&quot; (MCMi), with programs funded by the federal government. It helps support &quot;partner&quot; agencies and organisations prepare for public health emergencies that could require MCMs.

===Medications===
The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research uses different requirements for the three main drug product types: new drugs, generic drugs, and over-the-counter drugs. A drug is considered &quot;new&quot; if it is made by a different manufacturer, uses different excipients or inactive ingredients, is used for a different purpose, or undergoes any substantial change. The most rigorous requirements apply to &quot;new molecular entities&quot;: drugs that are not based on existing medications.

====New medications====

New drugs receive extensive scrutiny before FDA approval in a process called a new drug application (NDA). Under the Presidency of Donald Trump, the agency has worked to make the drug-approval process go faster. Critics, however, argue that FDA standards are not sufficiently rigorous to prevent unsafe or ineffective drugs from getting approval. New drugs are available only by prescription by default. A change to over-the-counter (OTC) status is a separate process, and the drug must be approved through an NDA first. A drug that is approved is said to be &quot;safe and effective when used as directed&quot;.

Very rare, limited exceptions to this multi-step process involving animal testing and controlled clinical trials can be granted out of compassionate use protocols. This was the case during the 2015 Ebola epidemic with the use, by prescription and authorization, of ZMapp and other experimental treatments, and for new drugs that can be used to treat debilitating and/or very rare conditions for which no existing remedies or drugs are satisfactory, or where there has not been an advance in a long period of time. The studies are progressively longer, gradually adding more individuals as they progress from stage I to stage III, normally over a period of years, and normally involve drug companies, the government and its laboratories, and often medical schools and hospitals and clinics. However, any exceptions to the aforementioned process are subject to strict review and scrutiny and conditions, and are only given if a substantial amount of research and at least some preliminary human testing has shown that they are believed to be somewhat safe and possibly effective. (See FDA Special Protocol Assessment about Phase III trials.)

=====Advertising and promotion=====

The FDA&#x27;s Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) has responsibilities that revolve around the review and regulation of prescription drug advertising and promotion. This is achieved through surveillance activities and the issuance of enforcement letters to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Advertising and promotion for over-the-counter drugs is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. The FDA also implements regulatory oversight through engagement with third-party enforcer-firms. It expects pharmaceutical companies to ensure that third-party suppliers and labs comply with the agency&#x27;s health and safety guidelines .

The drug advertising regulation contains two broad requirements: (1) a company may advertise or promote a drug only for the specific indication or medical use for which it was approved by FDA. Also, an advertisement must contain a &quot;fair balance&quot; between the benefits and the risks (side effects) of a drug. The regulation of drug advertising in the U.S. is divided between the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), based on whether the drug in question is a prescription drug or an over-the-counter (OTC) drug. The FDA oversees the advertising of prescription drugs, while the FTC regulates the advertising of OTC drugs.

The term off-label refers to the practice of prescribing a drug for a different purpose than what the FDA approved.

Due to this approval requirement, manufacturers were prohibited from advertising COVID-19 vaccines during the period in which they had only been approved under Emergency Use Authorization.

=====Post-market safety surveillance=====
After NDA approval, the sponsor must then review and report to the FDA every single patient adverse drug experience it learns of. They must report unexpected serious and fatal adverse drug events within 15 days, and other events on a quarterly basis. The FDA also receives directly adverse drug event reports through its MedWatch program. These reports are called &quot;spontaneous reports&quot; because reporting by consumers and health professionals is voluntary.

While this remains the primary tool of post-market safety surveillance, FDA requirements for post-marketing risk management are increasing. As a condition of approval, a sponsor may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, called Phase IV trials. In some cases, the FDA requires risk management plans called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) for some drugs that require actions to be taken to ensure that the drug is used safely. For example, thalidomide can cause birth defects, but has uses that outweigh the risks if men and women taking the drugs do not conceive a child; a REMS program for thalidomide mandates an auditable process to ensure that people taking the drug take action to avoid pregnancy; many opioid drugs have REMS programs to avoid addiction and diversion of drugs. The drug isotretinoin has a REMS program called iPLEDGE.

====Generic drugs====
Generic drugs are chemical and therapeutic equivalents of name-brand drugs, normally whose patents have expired. Approved generic drugs should have the same dosage, safety, effectiveness, strength, stability, and quality, as well as route of administration. In general, they are less expensive than their name brand counterparts, are manufactured and marketed by rival companies and, in the 1990s, accounted for about a third of all prescriptions written in the United States. For a pharmaceutical company to gain approval to produce a generic drug, the FDA requires scientific evidence that the generic drug is interchangeable with or therapeutically equivalent to the originally approved drug. This is called an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). 80% of prescription drugs sold in the United States are generic brands.

=====Generic drug scandal=====
In 1989, a major scandal erupted involving the procedures used by the FDA to approve generic drugs for sale to the public. Charges of corruption in generic drug approval first emerged in 1988 during the course of an extensive congressional investigation into the FDA. The oversight subcommittee of the United States House Energy and Commerce Committee resulted from a complaint brought against the FDA by Mylan Laboratories Inc. of Pittsburgh. When its application to manufacture generics were subjected to repeated delays by the FDA, Mylan, convinced that it was being discriminated against, soon began its own private investigation of the agency in 1987. Mylan eventually filed suit against two former FDA employees and four drug-manufacturing companies, charging that corruption within the federal agency resulted in racketeering and in violations of antitrust law. &quot;The order in which new generic drugs were approved was set by the FDA employees even before drug manufacturers submitted applications&quot; and, according to Mylan, this illegal procedure was followed to give preferential treatment to certain companies. During the summer of 1989, three FDA officials (Charles Y. Chang, David J. Brancato, Walter Kletch) pleaded guilty to criminal charges of accepting bribes from generic drugs makers, and two companies (Par Pharmaceutical and its subsidiary Quad Pharmaceuticals) pleaded guilty to giving bribes.

Furthermore, it was discovered that several manufacturers had falsified data submitted in seeking FDA authorization to market certain generic drugs. Vitarine Pharmaceuticals of New York, which sought approval of a generic version of the drug Dyazide, a medication for high blood pressure, submitted Dyazide, rather than its generic version, for the FDA tests. In April 1989, the FDA investigated 11 manufacturers for irregularities; and later brought that number up to 13. Dozens of drugs were eventually suspended or recalled by manufacturers. In the early 1990s, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed securities fraud charges against the Bolar Pharmaceutical Company, a major generic manufacturer based in Long Island, New York.

====Over-the-counter drugs====
Over-the-counter (OTC) are drugs like aspirin that do not require a doctor&#x27;s prescription. The FDA has a list of approximately 800 such approved ingredients that are combined in various ways to create more than 100,000 OTC drug products. Many OTC drug ingredients had been previously approved prescription drugs now deemed safe enough for use without a medical practitioner&#x27;s supervision like ibuprofen.

====Ebola treatment====
In 2014, the FDA added an Ebola treatment being developed by Canadian pharmaceutical company Tekmira to the Fast Track program, but halted the phase 1 trials in July pending the receipt of more information about how the drug works. This was widely viewed as increasingly important in the face of a major outbreak of the disease in West Africa that began in late March 2014 and ended in June 2016.

==== Coronavirus (COVID-19) testing ====

During the coronavirus pandemic, FDA granted emergency use authorization for personal protective equipment (PPE), in vitro diagnostic equipment, ventilators and other medical devices.

On March 18, 2020, FDA inspectors postponed most foreign facility inspections and all domestic routine surveillance facility inspections. In contrast, the USDA&#x27;s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) continued inspections of meatpacking plants, which resulted in 145 FSIS field employees who tested positive for COVID-19, and three who died.

===Vaccines, blood and tissue products, and biotechnology===
The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research is the branch of the FDA responsible for ensuring the safety and efficacy of biological therapeutic agents. These include blood and blood products, vaccines, allergenics, cell and tissue-based products, and gene therapy products. New biologics are required to go through a premarket approval process called a Biologics License Application (BLA), similar to that for drugs.

The original authority for government regulation of biological products was established by the 1902 Biologics Control Act, with additional authority established by the 1944 Public Health Service Act. Along with these Acts, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act applies to all biologic products, as well. Originally, the entity responsible for regulation of biological products resided under the National Institutes of Health; this authority was transferred to the FDA in 1972.

===Medical and radiation-emitting devices===
The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is the branch of the FDA responsible for the premarket approval of all medical devices, as well as overseeing the manufacturing, performance and safety of these devices. The definition of a medical device is given in the FD&amp;C Act, and it includes products from the simple toothbrush to complex devices such as implantable neurostimulators. CDRH also oversees the safety performance of non-medical devices that emit certain types of electromagnetic radiation. Examples of CDRH-regulated devices include cellular phones, airport baggage screening equipment, television receivers, microwave ovens, tanning booths, and laser products.

CDRH regulatory powers include the authority to require certain technical reports from the manufacturers or importers of regulated products, to require that radiation-emitting products meet mandatory safety performance standards, to declare regulated products defective, and to order the recall of defective or noncompliant products. CDRH also conducts limited amounts of direct product testing.

====&quot;FDA-Cleared&quot; vs &quot;FDA-Approved&quot;====
Clearance requests are required for medical devices that prove they are &quot;substantially equivalent&quot; to the predicate devices already on the market. Approved requests are for items that are new or substantially different and need to demonstrate &quot;safety and efficacy&quot;, for example they may be inspected for safety in case of new toxic hazards. Both aspects need to be proved or provided by the submitter to ensure proper procedures are followed.

===Cosmetics===

Cosmetics are regulated by the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, the same branch of the FDA that regulates food. Cosmetic products are not, in general, subject to premarket approval by the FDA unless they make &quot;structure or function claims&quot; that make them into drugs (see Cosmeceutical). However, all color additives must be specifically FDA approved before manufacturers can include them in cosmetic products sold in the U.S. The FDA regulates cosmetics labeling, and cosmetics that have not been safety tested must bear a warning to that effect.

According to the industry advocacy group, the American Council on Science and Health, though the cosmetic industry is primarily responsible for its own product safety, the FDA can intervene when necessary to protect the public. In general, though, cosmetics do not require pre-market approval or testing. The ACSH says that companies must place a warning note on their products if they have not been tested, and that experts in cosmetic ingredient review also play a role in monitoring safety through influence on ingredients, but they lack legal authority. According to the ACSH, it has reviewed about 1,200 ingredients and has suggested that several hundred be restricted—but there is no standard or systemic method for reviewing chemicals for safety, or a clear definition of what &#x27;safety&#x27; even means so that all chemicals get tested on the same basis.

However, on December 29, 2022, President Biden signed the &#x27;2023 Consolidated Budget Act&#x27;, which includes the &#x27;Cosmetics Regulatory Modernization Act of 2022 (MoCRA)&#x27;, which is a stricter regulation that is different from the previous regulations. MoCRA requires compliance with matters such as serious adverse event reporting, safety substantiation, additional labeling, record keeping, and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). MoCRA also calls on the FDA to grant Mandatory Recall Authority and establish regulations for GMP rules, flavor allergen labeling rules, and testing methods for cosmetics containing talc.

===Veterinary products===
The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is a center of the FDA that regulates food additives and drugs that are given to animals. CVM regulates animal drugs, animal food including pet animal, and animal medical devices. The FDA&#x27;s requirements to prevent the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy are also administered by CVM through inspections of feed manufacturers. CVM does not regulate vaccines for animals; these are handled by the United States Department of Agriculture.

===Tobacco products===
The FDA regulates tobacco products with authority established by the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. This Act requires color warnings on cigarette packages and printed advertising, and text warnings from the U.S. Surgeon General.

The nine new graphic warning labels were announced by the FDA in June 2011 and were scheduled to be required to appear on packaging by September 2012. The implementation date is uncertain, due to ongoing proceedings in the case of &quot;R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration&quot;. R.J. Reynolds, Lorillard, Commonwealth Brands, Liggett Group and Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company have filed suit in Washington, D.C. federal court claiming that the graphic labels are an unconstitutional way of forcing tobacco companies to engage in anti-smoking advocacy on the government&#x27;s behalf.

A First Amendment lawyer, Floyd Abrams, is representing the tobacco companies in the case, contending requiring graphic warning labels on a lawful product cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny. The Association of National Advertisers and the American Advertising Federation have also filed a brief in the suit, arguing that the labels infringe on commercial free speech and could lead to further government intrusion if left unchallenged. In November 2011, Federal judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia temporarily halted the new labels, likely delaying the requirement that tobacco companies display the labels. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately could decide the matter.

In July 2017, the FDA announced a plan that would reduce the current levels of nicotine permitted in tobacco cigarettes. The proposed regulation, identified as RIN 0910-AI76, titled &quot;Tobacco Product Standard for Nicotine Yield of Cigarettes and Certain Other Combusted Tobacco Products,&quot; seeks to reduce the nicotine content in cigarettes to approximately 0.7 milligrams per gram of tobacco.

===Regulation of living organisms===
With acceptance of premarket notification 510(k) k033391 in January 2004, the FDA granted Ronald Sherman permission to produce and market medical maggots for use in humans or other animals as a prescription medical device. Medical maggots represent the first living organism allowed by the Food and Drug Administration for production and marketing as a prescription medical device.

In June 2004, the FDA cleared &quot;Hirudo medicinalis&quot; (medicinal leeches) as the second living organism legal to use as a medical device.

The FDA also requires that milk be pasteurized to remove bacteria.

===International Cooperation===
In February 2011, President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a &quot;Declaration on a Shared Vision for Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness&quot; and announced the creation of the Canada-United States Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) &quot;to increase regulatory transparency and coordination between the two countries.&quot;

Under the RCC mandate, the FDA and Health Canada undertook a &quot;first of its kind&quot; initiative by selecting &quot;as its first area of alignment common cold indications for certain over-the-counter antihistamine ingredients (GC 2013-01-10).&quot;

A more recent example of the FDA&#x27;s international work is their 2018 cooperation with regulatory and law-enforcement agencies worldwide through Interpol as part of Operation Pangea XI. The FDA targeted 465 websites that illegally sold potentially dangerous, unapproved versions of opioid, oncology, and antiviral prescription drugs to U.S. consumers. The agency focused on transaction laundering schemes in order to uncover the complex online drug network.

==Science and research programs==

The FDA carries out research and development activities to develop technology and standards that support its regulatory role, with the objective of resolving scientific and technical challenges before they become impediments. The FDA&#x27;s research efforts include the areas of biologics, medical devices, drugs, women&#x27;s health, toxicology, food safety and applied nutrition, and veterinary medicine.

==Data management==
The FDA has collected a large amount of data through the decades. The OpenFDA project was created to enable easy access of the data for the public and was officially launched in June 2014.

==History==
Up until the 20th century, there were few federal laws regulating the contents and sale of domestically produced food and pharmaceuticals, with one exception being the Vaccine Act of 1813. The history of the FDA can be traced to the latter part of the 19th century and the Division of Chemistry of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which itself derived from the Copyright and Patent Clause. Under Harvey Washington Wiley, appointed chief chemist in 1883, the Division began conducting research into the adulteration and misbranding of food and drugs on the American market. Wiley&#x27;s advocacy came at a time when the public had become aroused to hazards in the marketplace by muckraking journalists like Upton Sinclair, and became part of a general trend for increased federal regulations in matters pertinent to public safety during the Progressive Era. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was put in place after a diphtheria antitoxin derived from tetanus-contaminated serum caused the deaths of thirteen children in St. Louis, Missouri. The serum was originally collected from a horse named Jim who had contracted tetanus.

In June 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt signed into law the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, also known as the &quot;Wiley Act&quot; after its chief advocate. The Act prohibited, under penalty of seizure of goods, the interstate transport of food that had been &quot;adulterated&quot;. The Act applied similar penalties to the interstate marketing of &quot;adulterated&quot; drugs, in which the &quot;standard of strength, quality, or purity&quot; of the active ingredient was not either stated clearly on the label or listed in the &quot;United States Pharmacopeia&quot; or the &quot;National Formulary&quot;.

The responsibility for examining food and drugs for such &quot;adulteration&quot; or &quot;misbranding&quot; was given to Wiley&#x27;s USDA Bureau of Chemistry. Wiley used these new regulatory powers to pursue an aggressive campaign against the manufacturers of foods with chemical additives, but the Chemistry Bureau&#x27;s authority was soon checked by judicial decisions, which narrowly defined the bureau&#x27;s powers and set high standards for proof of fraudulent intent. In 1927, the Bureau of Chemistry&#x27;s regulatory powers were reorganized under a new USDA body, the Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration. This name was shortened to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) three years later.

By the 1930s, muckraking journalists, consumer protection organizations, and federal regulators began mounting a campaign for stronger regulatory authority by publicizing a list of injurious products that had been ruled permissible under the 1906 law, including radioactive beverages, mascara that could cause blindness, and worthless &quot;cures&quot; for diabetes and tuberculosis. The resulting proposed law did not get through the Congress of the United States for five years, but was rapidly enacted into law following the public outcry over the 1937 Elixir Sulfanilamide tragedy, in which over 100 people died after using a drug formulated with a toxic, untested solvent.

President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act into law on June 24, 1938. The new law significantly increased federal regulatory authority over drugs by mandating a pre-market review of the safety of all new drugs, as well as banning false therapeutic claims in drug labeling without requiring that the FDA prove fraudulent intent. The law also authorized the FDA to issue minimum food standards of identity for all mass-produced foods to reduce food fraud.

Soon after passage of the 1938 Act, the FDA began to designate certain drugs as safe for use only under the supervision of a medical professional, and the category of &quot;prescription-only&quot; drugs was securely codified into law by the Durham-Humphrey Amendment in 1951. These developments confirmed extensive powers for the FDA to enforce post-marketing recalls of ineffective drugs.

Outside of the US, the drug thalidomide was marketed for the relief of general nausea and morning sickness, but caused birth defects and even the death of thousands of babies when taken during pregnancy. American mothers were largely unaffected as Frances Oldham Kelsey of the FDA refused to authorize the medication for market. In 1962, the Kefauver-Harris Amendment to the FD&amp;C Act was passed, which represented a &quot;revolution&quot; in FDA regulatory authority. The most important change was the requirement that all new drug applications demonstrate &quot;substantial evidence&quot; of the drug&#x27;s efficacy for a marketed indication, in addition to the existing requirement for pre-marketing demonstration of safety. This marked the start of the FDA approval process in its modern form.

These reforms had the effect of increasing the time, and the difficulty, required to bring a drug to market. One of the most important statutes in establishing the modern American pharmaceutical market was the 1984 Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, more commonly known as the &quot;Hatch-Waxman Act&quot; after its chief sponsors. The act extended the patent exclusivity terms of new drugs, and tied those extensions, in part, to the length of the FDA approval process for each individual drug. For generic manufacturers, the Act created a new approval mechanism, the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), in which the generic drug manufacturer need only demonstrate that their generic formulation has the same active ingredient, route of administration, dosage form, strength, and pharmacokinetic properties (&quot;bioequivalence&quot;) as the corresponding brand-name drug. This Act has been credited with, in essence, creating the modern generic drug industry.

Concerns about the length of the drug approval process were brought to the fore early in the AIDS epidemic. In the mid- and late 1980s, ACT-UP and other HIV activist organizations accused the FDA of unnecessarily delaying the approval of medications to fight HIV and opportunistic infections. Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA issued new rules to expedite approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases, and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options. All of the initial drugs approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS were approved through these accelerated approval mechanisms. Frank Young, then commissioner of the FDA, was behind the Action Plan Phase II, established in August 1987 for quicker approval of AIDS medication.

In two instances, state governments have sought to legalize drugs that the FDA has not approved. Under the theory that federal law, passed pursuant to Constitutional authority, overrules conflicting state laws, federal authorities still claim the authority to seize, arrest, and prosecute for possession and sales of these substances, even in states where they are legal under state law. The first wave was the legalization by 27 states of laetrile in the late 1970s. This drug was used as a treatment for cancer, but scientific studies both before and after this legislative trend found it ineffective. The second wave concerned medical marijuana in the 1990s and 2000s. Though Virginia passed legislation allowing doctors to recommend cannabis for glaucoma or the side effects of chemotherapy, a more widespread trend began in California with the Compassionate Use Act of 1996.

When the FDA requested Endo Pharmaceuticals on June 8, 2017, to remove &quot;oxymorphone hydrochloride&quot; from the market, it was the first request in FDA history to recall an effective drug over its potential for misuse.

In February 2025, FDA food division head Jim Jones quit in protest of the &quot;indiscriminate&quot; layoffs of 89 staff members by the Donald Trump administration.

==21st-century reforms==

===Critical Path Initiative===
The Critical Path Initiative is the FDA&#x27;s effort to stimulate and facilitate a national effort to modernize the sciences through which FDA-regulated products are developed, evaluated, and manufactured. The Initiative was launched in March 2004, with the release of a report entitled Innovation/Stagnation: Challenge and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New Medical Products.

===Patients&#x27; rights to access unapproved drugs===
The Compassionate Investigational New Drug program was created after &quot;Randall v. U.S.&quot; ruled in favor of Robert C. Randall in 1978, creating a program for medical marijuana.

A 2006 court case, &quot;Abigail Alliance v. von Eschenbach&quot;, would have forced radical changes in FDA regulation of unapproved drugs. The Abigail Alliance argued that the FDA must license drugs for use by terminally ill patients with &quot;desperate diagnoses&quot;, after they have completed Phase I testing. The case won an initial appeal in May 2006, but that decision was reversed by a March 2007 rehearing. The US Supreme Court declined to hear the case, and the final decision denied the existence of a right to unapproved medications.

Critics of the FDA&#x27;s regulatory power argue that the FDA takes too long to approve drugs that might ease pain and human suffering faster if brought to market sooner. The AIDS crisis created some political efforts to streamline the approval process. However, these limited reforms were targeted for AIDS drugs, not for the broader market. This has led to the call for more robust and enduring reforms that would allow patients, under the care of their doctors, access to drugs that have passed the first round of clinical trials.

===Post-marketing drug safety monitoring===
The widely publicized recall of Vioxx, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) now estimated to have contributed to fatal heart attacks in thousands of Americans, played a strong role in driving a new wave of safety reforms at both the FDA rulemaking and statutory levels. The FDA approved Vioxx in 1999, and initially hoped it would be safer than previous NSAIDs due to its reduced risk of intestinal tract bleeding. However, a number of pre and post-marketing studies suggested that Vioxx might increase the risk of myocardial infarction, and results from the APPROVe trial in 2004 conclusively demonstrated this.

Faced with numerous lawsuits, the manufacturer voluntarily withdrew it from the market. The example of Vioxx has been prominent in an ongoing debate over whether new drugs should be evaluated on the basis of their absolute safety, or their safety relative to existing treatments for a given condition. In the wake of the Vioxx recall, there were widespread calls by major newspapers, medical journals, consumer advocacy organizations, lawmakers, and FDA officials for reforms in the FDA&#x27;s procedures for pre- and post-market drug safety regulation.

In 2006, a Congressional committee was appointed by the Institute of Medicine to review pharmaceutical safety regulation in the U.S. and to issue recommendations for improvements. The committee was composed of 16 experts, including leaders in clinical medicine medical research, economics, biostatistics, law, public policy, public health, and the allied health professions, as well as current and former executives from the pharmaceutical, hospital, and health insurance industries. The authors found major deficiencies in the current FDA system for ensuring the safety of drugs on the American market. Overall, the authors called for an increase in the regulatory powers, funding, and independence of the FDA. Some of the committee&#x27;s recommendations were incorporated into drafts of the PDUFA IV amendment, which was signed into law as the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007.

As of 2011, Risk Minimization Action Plans (RiskMAPS) have been created to ensure risks of a drug never outweigh the benefits of that drug within the post-marketing period. This program requires that manufacturers design and implement periodic assessments of their programs&#x27; effectiveness. The Risk Minimization Action Plans are set in place depending on the overall level of risk a prescription drug is likely to pose to the public.

===Pediatric drug testing===
Prior to the 1990s, only 20% of all drugs prescribed for children in the United States were tested for safety or efficacy in a pediatric population. This became a major concern of pediatricians as evidence accumulated that the physiological response of children to many drugs differed significantly from those drugs&#x27; effects on adults. Children react differently to the drugs because of many reasons, including size, weight, etc. There were several reasons that few medical trials were done with children. For many drugs, children represented such a small proportion of the potential market, that drug manufacturers did not see such testing as cost-effective.

Also, the belief that children are ethically restricted in their ability to give informed consent brought increased governmental and institutional hurdles to approval of these clinical trials, and greater concerns about legal liability. Thus, for decades, most medicines prescribed to children in the U.S. were done so in a non-FDA-approved, &quot;off-label&quot; manner, with dosages &quot;extrapolated&quot; from adult data through body weight and body-surface-area calculations.

In an initial FDA attempt to address this issue they produced the 1994 FDA Final Rule on Pediatric Labeling and Extrapolation, which allowed manufacturers to add pediatric labeling information, but required drugs that had not been tested for pediatric safety and efficacy to bear a disclaimer to that effect. However, this rule failed to motivate many drug companies to conduct additional pediatric drug trials. In 1997, the FDA proposed a rule to require pediatric drug trials from the sponsors of New Drug Applications. However, this new rule was successfully preempted in federal court as exceeding the FDA&#x27;s statutory authority.

While this debate was unfolding, Congress used the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 to pass incentives that gave pharmaceutical manufacturers a six-month patent term extension on new drugs submitted with pediatric trial data. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2007 reauthorized these provisions and allowed the FDA to request NIH-sponsored testing for pediatric drug testing, although these requests are subject to NIH funding constraints. In the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, Congress codified the FDA&#x27;s authority to mandate manufacturer-sponsored pediatric drug trials for certain drugs as a &quot;last resort&quot; if incentives and publicly funded mechanisms proved inadequate.

===Priority review voucher (PRV)===
The priority review voucher is a provision of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, which awards a transferable &quot;priority review voucher&quot; to any company that obtains approval for a treatment for a neglected tropical diseases. The system was first proposed by Duke University faculty David Ridley, Henry Grabowski, and Jeffrey Moe in their 2006 &quot;Health Affairs&quot; paper: &quot;Developing Drugs for Developing Countries&quot;. President Obama signed into law the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, which extended the authorization until 2017.

===Rules for generic biologics===
Since the 1990s, many successful new drugs for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and other conditions have been protein-based biotechnology drugs, regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Many of these drugs are extremely expensive; for example, the anti-cancer drug Avastin costs $55,000 for a year of treatment, while the enzyme replacement therapy drug Cerezyme costs $200,000 per year, and must be taken by Gaucher&#x27;s disease patients for life.

Biotechnology drugs do not have the simple, readily verifiable chemical structures of conventional drugs, and are produced through complex, often proprietary, techniques, such as transgenic mammalian cell cultures. Because of these complexities, the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act did not include biologics in the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) process. This precluded the possibility of generic drug competition for biotechnology drugs. In February 2007, identical bills were introduced into the House to create an ANDA process for the approval of generic biologics, but were not passed.

===Mobile medical applications===
In 2013, a guidance was issued to regulate mobile medical applications and protect users from their unintended use. This guidance distinguishes the apps subjected to regulation based on the marketing claims of the apps. Incorporation of the guidelines during the development phase of these apps has been proposed for expedited market entry and clearance.

===Electronic Submissions Gateway (ESG)===

To standardize, automate and streamline the flow of regulatory data, FDA introduced an Electronic Submissions Gateway (ESG) in 2006. This gateway allows reporting organizations to send regulatory submissions to different centers over the internet, packaged in a center-specific format and enveloped as a GNU-compatible .tar.gz file, through either a FDA-specific WebTrader application or via a more generic B2B communication protocol called AS2 (Applicability Statement 2).

For WebTrader, which is recommended for manual, small-volume submissions, users would typically install a client application on their computers and upload the package through it to FDA server. In AS2, which is recommended for automated or high-volume submissions, users can use any standard AS2 software to transmit the package to FDA by including additional routing details on top of standard AS2, in the form of custom HTTP request headers.

==Criticism==

The FDA has regulatory oversight over a large array of products that affect the health and life of American citizens. As a result, the FDA&#x27;s powers and decisions are carefully monitored by several governmental and non-governmental organizations. A $1.8million 2006 Institute of Medicine report on pharmaceutical regulation in the U.S. found major deficiencies in the current FDA system for ensuring the safety of drugs on the American market. Overall, the authors called for an increase in the regulatory powers, funding, and independence of the FDA.

A 2022 article from &quot;Politico&quot; raised concerns that food is not a high priority at the FDA. The report explains the FDA has structural and leadership problems in the food division and is often deferential to industry. This might be attributed to lobbying and influence of big food companies in Washington, D.C.

<text>In mathematics, particularly in algebra, a field extension is a pair of fields formula_1, such that the operations of &quot;K&quot; are those of &quot;L&quot; restricted to &quot;K&quot;. In this case, &quot;L&quot; is an extension field of &quot;K&quot; and &quot;K&quot; is a subfield of &quot;L&quot;. For example, under the usual notions of addition and multiplication, the complex numbers are an extension field of the real numbers; the real numbers are a subfield of the complex numbers.

Field extensions are fundamental in algebraic number theory, and in the study of polynomial roots through Galois theory, and are widely used in algebraic geometry.

==Subfield==
A subfield formula_2 of a field formula_3 is a subset formula_4 that is a field with respect to the field operations inherited from formula_3. Equivalently, a subfield is a subset that contains the multiplicative identity formula_6, and is closed under the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and taking the inverse of a nonzero element of formula_2.

As , the latter definition implies formula_2 and formula_3 have the same zero element.

For example, the field of rational numbers is a subfield of the real numbers, which is itself a subfield of the complex numbers. More generally, the field of rational numbers is (or is isomorphic to) a subfield of any field of characteristic formula_10.

The characteristic of a subfield is the same as the characteristic of the larger field.

==Extension field==

If formula_2 is a subfield of formula_3, then formula_3 is an extension field or simply extension of formula_2, and this pair of fields is a field extension. Such a field extension is denoted formula_15 (read as &quot;formula_3 over formula_2&quot;).

If formula_3 is an extension of formula_19, which is in turn an extension of formula_2, then formula_19 is said to be an intermediate field (or intermediate extension or subextension) of formula_15.

Given a field extension formula_15, the larger field formula_3 is a formula_2-vector space. The dimension of this vector space is called the degree of the extension and is denoted by formula_26. 

The degree of an extension is 1 if and only if the two fields are equal. In this case, the extension is a . Extensions of degree 2 and 3 are called quadratic extensions and cubic extensions, respectively. A finite extension is an extension that has a finite degree.

Given two extensions formula_15 and formula_28, the extension formula_29 is finite if and only if both formula_15 and formula_28 are finite. In this case, one has

:formula_32

Given a field extension formula_15 and a subset formula_34 of formula_3, there is a smallest subfield of formula_3 that contains formula_2 and formula_34. It is the intersection of all subfields of formula_3 that contain formula_2 and formula_34, and is denoted by formula_42 (read as &quot;formula_2 &quot;&quot; formula_34&quot;). One says that formula_42 is the field &quot;generated&quot; by formula_34 over formula_2, and that formula_34 is a generating set of formula_42 over formula_2. When formula_51 is finite, one writes formula_52 instead of formula_53 and one says that formula_42 is over formula_2. If formula_34 consists of a single element formula_57, the extension formula_58 is called a simple extension and formula_57 is called a primitive element of the extension.

An extension field of the form formula_42 is often said to result from the &quot;&quot; of formula_34 to formula_2.

In characteristic 0, every finite extension is a simple extension. This is the primitive element theorem, which does not hold true for fields of non-zero characteristic.

If a simple extension formula_58 is not finite, the field formula_64 is isomorphic to the field of rational fractions in formula_57 over formula_2.

== Caveats ==
The notation &quot;L&quot; / &quot;K&quot; is purely formal and does not imply the formation of a quotient ring or quotient group or any other kind of division. Instead the slash expresses the word &quot;over&quot;. In some literature the notation &quot;L&quot;:&quot;K&quot; is used.

It is often desirable to talk about field extensions in situations where the small field is not actually contained in the larger one, but is naturally embedded. For this purpose, one abstractly defines a field extension as an injective ring homomorphism between two fields.
&quot;Every&quot; non-zero ring homomorphism between fields is injective because fields do not possess nontrivial proper ideals, so field extensions are precisely the morphisms in the category of fields.

Henceforth, we will suppress the injective homomorphism and assume that we are dealing with actual subfields.

== Examples ==
The field of complex numbers formula_67 is an extension field of the field of real numbers formula_68, and formula_68 in turn is an extension field of the field of rational numbers formula_70. Clearly then, formula_71 is also a field extension. We have formula_72 because formula_73 is a basis, so the extension formula_74 is finite. This is a simple extension because formula_75 formula_76 (the cardinality of the continuum), so this extension is infinite.

The field 

:formula_77

is an extension field of formula_78 also clearly a simple extension. The degree is 2 because formula_79 can serve as a basis. 

The field

:formula_80

is an extension field of both formula_81 and formula_78 of degree 2 and 4 respectively. It is also a simple extension, as one can show that 

:formula_83

Finite extensions of formula_70 are also called algebraic number fields and are important in number theory. Another extension field of the rationals, which is also important in number theory, although not a finite extension, is the field of p-adic numbers formula_85 for a prime number &quot;p&quot;.

It is common to construct an extension field of a given field &quot;K&quot; as a quotient ring of the polynomial ring &quot;K&quot;[&quot;X&quot;] in order to &quot;create&quot; a root for a given polynomial &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). Suppose for instance that &quot;K&quot; does not contain any element &quot;x&quot; with &quot;x&quot;2 = −1. Then the polynomial formula_86 is irreducible in &quot;K&quot;[&quot;X&quot;], consequently the ideal generated by this polynomial is maximal, and formula_87 is an extension field of &quot;K&quot; which &quot;does&quot; contain an element whose square is −1 (namely the residue class of &quot;X&quot;).

By iterating the above construction, one can construct a splitting field of any polynomial from &quot;K&quot;[&quot;X&quot;]. This is an extension field &quot;L&quot; of &quot;K&quot; in which the given polynomial splits into a product of linear factors.

If &quot;p&quot; is any prime number and &quot;n&quot; is a positive integer, there is a unique (up to isomorphism) finite field formula_88 with &quot;pn&quot; elements; this is an extension field of the prime field formula_89 with &quot;p&quot; elements.

Given a field &quot;K&quot;, we can consider the field &quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) of all rational functions in the variable &quot;X&quot; with coefficients in &quot;K&quot;; the elements of &quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) are fractions of two polynomials over &quot;K&quot;, and indeed &quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is the field of fractions of the polynomial ring &quot;K&quot;[&quot;X&quot;]. This field of rational functions is an extension field of &quot;K&quot;. This extension is infinite.

Given a Riemann surface &quot;M&quot;, the set of all meromorphic functions defined on &quot;M&quot; is a field, denoted by formula_90 It is a transcendental extension field of formula_67 if we identify every complex number with the corresponding constant function defined on &quot;M&quot;. More generally, given an algebraic variety &quot;V&quot; over some field &quot;K&quot;, the function field &quot;K&quot;(&quot;V&quot;), consisting of the rational functions defined on &quot;V&quot;, is an extension field of &quot;K&quot;.

== Algebraic extension ==

An element &quot;x&quot; of a field extension formula_15 is algebraic over &quot;K&quot; if it is a root of a nonzero polynomial with coefficients in &quot;K&quot;. For example, formula_93 is algebraic over the rational numbers, because it is a root of formula_94 If an element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;L&quot; is algebraic over &quot;K&quot;, the monic polynomial of lowest degree that has &quot;x&quot; as a root is called the minimal polynomial of &quot;x&quot;. This minimal polynomial is irreducible over &quot;K&quot;.

An element &quot;s&quot; of &quot;L&quot; is algebraic over &quot;K&quot; if and only if the simple extension is a finite extension. In this case the degree of the extension equals the degree of the minimal polynomial, and a basis of the &quot;K&quot;-vector space &quot;K&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) consists of formula_95 where &quot;d&quot; is the degree of the minimal polynomial.

The set of the elements of &quot;L&quot; that are algebraic over &quot;K&quot; form a subextension, which is called the algebraic closure of &quot;K&quot; in &quot;L&quot;. This results from the preceding characterization: if &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are algebraic, the extensions and are finite. Thus is also finite, as well as the sub extensions , and (if ). It follows that , &quot;st&quot; and 1/&quot;s&quot; are all algebraic.

An &quot;algebraic extension&quot; formula_15 is an extension such that every element of &quot;L&quot; is algebraic over &quot;K&quot;. Equivalently, an algebraic extension is an extension that is generated by algebraic elements. For example, formula_97 is an algebraic extension of formula_70, because formula_93 and formula_100 are algebraic over formula_101

A simple extension is algebraic if and only if it is finite. This implies that an extension is algebraic if and only if it is the union of its finite subextensions, and that every finite extension is algebraic. 

Every field &quot;K&quot; has an algebraic closure, which is up to an isomorphism the largest extension field of &quot;K&quot; which is algebraic over &quot;K&quot;, and also the smallest extension field such that every polynomial with coefficients in &quot;K&quot; has a root in it. For example, formula_67 is an algebraic closure of formula_68, but not an algebraic closure of formula_70, as it is not algebraic over formula_70 (for example is not algebraic over formula_70).

==Transcendental extension==

Given a field extension formula_15, a subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;L&quot; is called algebraically independent over &quot;K&quot; if no non-trivial polynomial relation with coefficients in &quot;K&quot; exists among the elements of &quot;S&quot;. The largest cardinality of an algebraically independent set is called the transcendence degree of &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;. It is always possible to find a set &quot;S&quot;, algebraically independent over &quot;K&quot;, such that &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) is algebraic. Such a set &quot;S&quot; is called a transcendence basis of &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;. All transcendence bases have the same cardinality, equal to the transcendence degree of the extension. An extension formula_15 is said to be if and only if there exists a transcendence basis &quot;S&quot; of formula_15 such that &quot;L&quot; = &quot;K&quot;(&quot;S&quot;). Such an extension has the property that all elements of &quot;L&quot; except those of &quot;K&quot; are transcendental over &quot;K&quot;, but, however, there are extensions with this property which are not purely transcendental—a class of such extensions take the form &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; where both &quot;L&quot; and &quot;K&quot; are algebraically closed. 

If &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is purely transcendental and &quot;S&quot; is a transcendence basis of the extension, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily follow that &quot;L&quot; = &quot;K&quot;(&quot;S&quot;). On the opposite, even when one knows a transcendence basis, it may be difficult to decide whether the extension is purely separable, and if it is so, it may be difficult to find a transcendence basis &quot;S&quot; such that &quot;L&quot; = &quot;K&quot;(&quot;S&quot;).

For example, consider the extension formula_110 where formula_111 is transcendental over formula_78 and formula_113 is a root of the equation formula_114 Such an extension can be defined as formula_115 in which formula_111 and formula_113 are the equivalence classes of formula_118 and formula_119 Obviously, the singleton set formula_120 is transcendental over formula_70 and the extension formula_122 is algebraic; hence formula_120 is a transcendence basis that does not generates the extension formula_122. Similarly, formula_125 is a transcendence basis that does not generates the whole extension. However the extension is purely transcendental since, if one set formula_126 one has formula_127 and formula_128 and thus formula_129 generates the whole extension. 

Purely transcendental extensions of an algebraically closed field occur as function fields of rational varieties. The problem of finding a rational parametrization of a rational variety is equivalent with the problem of finding a transcendence basis that generates the whole extension.

== Normal, separable and Galois extensions ==
An algebraic extension formula_15 is called normal if every irreducible polynomial in &quot;K&quot;[&quot;X&quot;] that has a root in &quot;L&quot; completely factors into linear factors over &quot;L&quot;. Every algebraic extension &quot;F&quot;/&quot;K&quot; admits a normal closure &quot;L&quot;, which is an extension field of &quot;F&quot; such that formula_15 is normal and which is minimal with this property.

An algebraic extension formula_15 is called separable if the minimal polynomial of every element of &quot;L&quot; over &quot;K&quot; is separable, i.e., has no repeated roots in an algebraic closure over &quot;K&quot;. A Galois extension is a field extension that is both normal and separable.

A consequence of the primitive element theorem states that every finite separable extension has a primitive element (i.e. is simple).

Given any field extension formula_15, we can consider its automorphism group formula_134, consisting of all field automorphisms &quot;α&quot;: &quot;L&quot; → &quot;L&quot; with &quot;α&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;K&quot;. When the extension is Galois this automorphism group is called the Galois group of the extension. Extensions whose Galois group is abelian are called abelian extensions.

For a given field extension formula_15, one is often interested in the intermediate fields &quot;F&quot; (subfields of &quot;L&quot; that contain &quot;K&quot;). The significance of Galois extensions and Galois groups is that they allow a complete description of the intermediate fields: there is a bijection between the intermediate fields and the subgroups of the Galois group, described by the fundamental theorem of Galois theory.

== Generalizations ==
Field extensions can be generalized to ring extensions which consist of a ring and one of its subrings. A closer non-commutative analog are central simple algebras (CSAs) – ring extensions over a field, which are simple algebra (no non-trivial 2-sided ideals, just as for a field) and where the center of the ring is exactly the field. For example, the only finite field extension of the real numbers is the complex numbers, while the quaternions are a central simple algebra over the reals, and all CSAs over the reals are Brauer equivalent to the reals or the quaternions. CSAs can be further generalized to Azumaya algebras, where the base field is replaced by a commutative local ring.

== Extension of scalars ==

Given a field extension, one can &quot;extend scalars&quot; on associated algebraic objects. For example, given a real vector space, one can produce a complex vector space via complexification. In addition to vector spaces, one can perform extension of scalars for associative algebras defined over the field, such as polynomials or group algebras and the associated group representations. Extension of scalars of polynomials is often used implicitly, by just considering the coefficients as being elements of a larger field, but may also be considered more formally. Extension of scalars has numerous applications, as discussed in extension of scalars: applications.

<doc id="11635" wikidata="Q1196156" url="?curid=11635" title="Flood fill">
<text>Flood fill, also called seed fill, is a flooding algorithm that determines and alters the area connected to a given node in a multi-dimensional array with some matching attribute. It is used in the &quot;bucket&quot; fill tool of paint programs to fill connected, similarly colored areas with a different color, and in games such as Go and Minesweeper for determining which pieces are cleared. A variant called boundary fill uses the same algorithms but is defined as the area connected to a given node that does not have a particular attribute.

Note that flood filling is not suitable for drawing filled polygons, as it will miss some pixels in more acute corners. Instead, see Even-odd rule and Nonzero-rule.

==The algorithm parameters==

The traditional flood-fill algorithm takes three parameters: a start node, a target color, and a replacement color. The algorithm looks for all nodes in the array that are connected to the start node by a path of the target color and changes them to the replacement color. For a boundary-fill, in place of the target color, a border color would be supplied.

In order to generalize the algorithm in the common way, the following descriptions will instead have two routines available. One called codice_1 which returns true for unfilled points that, by their color, would be inside the filled area, and one called codice_2 which fills a pixel/node. Any node that has codice_2 called on it must then no longer be codice_1.

Depending on whether we consider nodes touching at the corners connected or not, we have two variations: eight-way and four-way respectively.

== Stack-based recursive implementation (four-way) ==

The earliest-known, implicitly stack-based, recursive, four-way flood-fill implementation goes as follows:

 Flood-fill (node):
 1. If &quot;node&quot; is not &quot;Inside&quot; return.
 2. &quot;Set&quot; the &quot;node&quot;
 3. Perform Flood-fill one step to the south of &quot;node&quot;.
 4. Perform Flood-fill one step to the north of &quot;node&quot;
 5. Perform Flood-fill one step to the west of &quot;node&quot;
 6. Perform Flood-fill one step to the east of &quot;node&quot;
 7. Return.

Though easy to understand, the implementation of the algorithm used above is impractical in languages and environments where stack space is severely constrained (e.g. Microcontrollers).

=== Moving the recursion into a data structure ===

Moving the recursion into a data structure (either a stack or a queue) prevents a stack overflow. It is similar to the simple recursive solution, except that instead of making recursive calls, it pushes the nodes onto a stack or queue for consumption, with the choice of data structure affecting the proliferation pattern:

 Flood-fill (node):
 1. Set &quot;Q&quot; to the empty queue or stack.
 2. Add &quot;node&quot; to the end of &quot;Q&quot;.
 3. While &quot;Q&quot; is not empty:
 4. Set &quot;n&quot; equal to the first element of &quot;Q&quot;.
 5. Remove first element from &quot;Q&quot;.
 6. If &quot;n&quot; is &quot;Inside&quot;:
 &quot;Set&quot; the &quot;n&quot;
 Add the node to the west of &quot;n&quot; to the end of &quot;Q&quot;.
 Add the node to the east of &quot;n&quot; to the end of &quot;Q&quot;.
 Add the node to the north of &quot;n&quot; to the end of &quot;Q&quot;.
 Add the node to the south of &quot;n&quot; to the end of &quot;Q&quot;.
 7. Continue looping until &quot;Q&quot; is exhausted.
 8. Return.

=== Further potential optimizations ===
* Check and set each node&#x27;s pixel color before adding it to the stack/queue, reducing stack/queue size.
* Use a loop for the east–west directions, queuing pixels above/below as you go (making it similar to the span filling algorithms, below).
* Interleave two or more copies of the code with extra stacks/queues, to allow out-of-order processors more opportunity to parallelize.
* Use multiple threads (ideally with slightly different visiting orders, so they don&#x27;t stay in the same area).

=== Advantages ===
* Very simple algorithm - easy to make bug-free.

=== Disadvantages ===
* Uses a lot of memory, particularly when using a stack.
* Tests most filled pixels a total of four times.
* Not suitable for pattern filling, as it requires pixel test results to change.
* Access pattern is not cache-friendly, for the queuing variant.
* Cannot easily optimize for multi-pixel words or bitplanes.

== Span filling ==

It&#x27;s possible to optimize things further by working primarily with spans, a row with constant codice_5. The first published complete example works on the following basic principle.

# Starting with a seed point, fill left and right. Keep track of the leftmost filled point codice_6 and rightmost filled point codice_7. This defines the span. 
# Scan from codice_6 to codice_7 above and below the seed point, searching for new seed points to continue with.

As an optimisation, the scan algorithm does not need restart from every seed point, but only those at the start of the next span. Using a stack explores spans depth first, whilst a queue explores spans breadth first.

 fn fill(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;):
 if not Inside(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) then return
 let &quot;s&quot; = new empty stack or queue
 Add (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) to &quot;s&quot;
 while &quot;s&quot; is not empty:
 Remove an (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) from &quot;s&quot;
 let &quot;lx&quot; = &quot;x&quot;
 while Inside(&quot;lx&quot; - 1, &quot;y&quot;):
 Set(&quot;lx&quot; - 1, &quot;y&quot;)
 &quot;lx&quot; = &quot;lx&quot; - 1
 while Inside(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;):
 Set(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;)
 &quot;x&quot; = &quot;x&quot; + 1
 scan(&quot;lx&quot;, &quot;x&quot; - 1, &quot;y&quot; + 1, &quot;s&quot;)
 scan(&quot;lx&quot;, &quot;x&quot; - 1, &quot;y&quot; - 1, &quot;s&quot;)
 fn scan(&quot;lx&quot;, &quot;rx&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;s&quot;):
 let &quot;span_added&quot; = &quot;false&quot;
 for &quot;x&quot; in &quot;lx&quot; .. &quot;rx&quot;:
 if not Inside(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;):
 &quot;span_added&quot; = &quot;false&quot;
 else if not &quot;span_added&quot;:
 Add (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) to &quot;s&quot;
 &quot;span_added&quot; = &quot;true&quot;

Over time, the following optimizations were realized:
* When a new scan would be entirely within a grandparent span, it would certainly only find filled pixels, and so wouldn&#x27;t need queueing.
* Further, when a new scan overlaps a grandparent span, only the overhangs (U-turns and W-turns) need to be scanned.
* It&#x27;s possible to fill while scanning for seeds 

The final, combined-scan-and-fill span filler was then published in 1990. In pseudo-code form:

 fn fill(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;):
 if not Inside(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) then return
 let &quot;s&quot; = new empty queue or stack
 Add (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, 1) to &quot;s&quot;

===Advantages===
* 2–8x faster than the pixel-recursive algorithm.
* Access pattern is cache and bitplane-friendly.
* Can draw a horizontal line rather than setting individual pixels.

===Disadvantages===
* Still visits pixels it has already filled. (For the popular algorithm, 3 scans of most pixels. For the final one, only doing extra scans of pixels where there are holes in the filled area.)
* Not suitable for pattern filling, as it requires pixel test results to change.

== Adding pattern filling support ==

Two common ways to make the span and pixel-based algorithms support pattern filling are either to use a unique color as a plain fill and then replace that with a pattern or to keep track (in a 2d Boolean array or as regions) of which pixels have been visited, using it to indicate pixels are no longer fillable. &quot;Inside&quot; must then return &quot;false&quot; for such visited pixels.

== Graph-theoretic filling ==

Some theorists applied explicit graph theory to the problem, treating spans of pixels, or aggregates of such, as nodes and studying their connectivity. The first published graph theory algorithm worked similarly to the span filling, above, but had a way to detect when it would duplicate filling of spans. Unfortunately, it had bugs that made it not complete some fills. A corrected algorithm was later published with a similar basis in graph theory; however, it alters the image as it goes along, to temporarily block off potential loops, complicating the programmatic interface. A later published algorithm depended on the boundary being distinct from everything else in the image and so isn&#x27;t suitable for most uses; it also requires an extra bit per pixel for bookkeeping.

===Advantages===
* Suitable for pattern filling, directly, as it never retests filled pixels.
* Double the speed of the original span algorithm, for uncomplicated fills.
* Access pattern is cache and bitplane-friendly.

===Disadvantages===
* Regularly, a span has to be compared to every other &#x27;front&#x27; in the queue, which significantly slows down complicated fills.
* Switching back and forth between graph theoretic and pixel domains complicates understanding.
* The code is fairly complicated, increasing the chances of bugs.

== Walk-based filling (Fixed-memory method)==
A method exists that uses essentially no memory for four-connected regions by pretending to be a painter trying to paint the region without painting themselves into a corner. This is also a method for solving mazes. The four pixels making the primary boundary are examined to see what action should be taken. The painter could find themselves in one of several conditions:

# All four boundary pixels are filled.
# Three of the boundary pixels are filled.
# Two of the boundary pixels are filled.
# One boundary pixel is filled.
# Zero boundary pixels are filled.

Where a path or boundary is to be followed, the right-hand rule is used. The painter follows the region by placing their right-hand on the wall (the boundary of the region) and progressing around the edge of the region without removing their hand.

For case #1, the painter paints (fills) the pixel the painter is standing upon and stops the algorithm.

For case #2, a path leading out of the area exists. Paint the pixel the painter is standing upon and move in the direction of the open path.

For case #3, the two boundary pixels define a path which, if we painted the current pixel, may block us from ever getting back to the other side of the path. We need a &quot;mark&quot; to define where we are and which direction we are heading to see if we ever get back to exactly the same pixel. If we already created such a &quot;mark&quot;, then we preserve our previous mark and move to the next pixel following the right-hand rule.

A mark is used for the first 2-pixel boundary that is encountered to remember where the passage started and in what direction the painter was moving. If the mark is encountered again and the painter is traveling in the same direction, then the painter knows that it is safe to paint the square with the mark and to continue in the same direction. This is because (through some unknown path) the pixels on the other side of the mark can be reached and painted in the future. The mark is removed for future use.

If the painter encounters the mark but is going in a different direction, then some sort of loop has occurred, which caused the painter to return to the mark. This loop must be eliminated. The mark is picked up, and the painter then proceeds in the direction indicated previously by the mark using a left-hand rule for the boundary (similar to the right-hand rule but using the painter&#x27;s left hand). This continues until an intersection is found (with three or more open boundary pixels). Still using the left-hand rule the painter now searches for a simple passage (made by two boundary pixels). Upon finding this two-pixel boundary path, that pixel is painted. This breaks the loop and allows the algorithm to continue.

For case #4, we need to check the opposite 8-connected corners to see whether they are filled or not. If either or both are filled, then this creates a many-path intersection and cannot be filled. If both are empty, then the current pixel can be painted and the painter can move following the right-hand rule.

The algorithm trades time for memory. For simple shapes it is very efficient. However, if the shape is complex with many features, the algorithm spends a large amount of time tracing the edges of the region trying to ensure that all can be painted.

A walking algorithm was published in 1994.

==Vector implementations==
Version 0.46 of Inkscape includes a bucket fill tool, giving output similar to ordinary bitmap operations and indeed using one: the canvas is rendered, a flood fill operation is performed on the selected area and the result is then traced back to a path. It uses the concept of a boundary condition.

<text>Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone ( 1181 – 3 October 1226), known as Francis of Assisi, was an Italian mystic, poet, and Catholic friar who founded the religious order of the Franciscans. Inspired to lead a Christian life of poverty, he became a beggar and itinerant preacher. 

One of the most venerated figures in Christianity, Francis was canonized by Pope Gregory IX on 16 July 1228. He is commonly portrayed wearing a brown habit with a rope tied around his waist, featuring three knots symbolizing the three Franciscan vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.

In 1219, he went to Egypt in an attempt to convert the sultan al-Kamil and put an end to the conflict of the Fifth Crusade. In 1223, he arranged for the first live nativity scene as part of the annual Christmas celebration in Greccio. According to Christian tradition, in 1224 Francis received the stigmata during the apparition of a Seraphic angel in a religious ecstasy.

Francis is associated with patronage of animals and the environment. It became customary for churches to hold ceremonies blessing animals on his feast day of the fourth of October, which became World Animal Day. He was noted for his devotion to the Eucharist. Along with Catherine of Siena, he was designated patron saint of Italy. He is also the namesake of the city of San Francisco.

September 17 is the feast of Francis&#x27; stigmatization.

== Names ==
Francis (; ) was baptized Giovanni by his mother. His surname, di Pietro di Bernardone, comes from his father, Pietro di Bernardone. The latter was in France on business when Francis was born in Assisi, a small town in Italy. Upon his return, Pietro took to calling his son Francesco (&quot;Free man&quot; or &quot;Frenchman&quot;), possibly in honour of his commercial success and enthusiasm for all things French.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Francis of Assisi was born , one of the children of an Italian father, Pietro di Bernardone dei Moriconi, a prosperous silk merchant, and a French mother, Pica di Bourlemont, about whom little is known except that she was a noblewoman originally from Provence.

Indulged by his parents, Francis lived the high-spirited life typical of a wealthy young man. As a youth, Francis became a devotee of troubadours and was fascinated with all things Transalpine. He was handsome, witty, gallant, and delighted in fine clothes. He spent money lavishly. Although many hagiographers remark about his bright clothing, rich friends, and love of pleasures, his displays of disillusionment toward the world that surrounded him came fairly early in his life, as is shown in the &quot;story of the beggar&quot;. In this account, he was selling cloth and velvet in the marketplace on behalf of his father when a beggar came to him and asked for alms. At the conclusion of his business deal, Francis abandoned his wares and ran after the beggar. When he found him, Francis gave the man everything he had in his purse. His friends mocked him for his charity; his father scolded him in rage.

Around 1202, he joined a military expedition against Perugia and was taken as a prisoner at Collestrada. He spent a year as a captive, during which an illness caused him to re-evaluate his life. However, upon his return to Assisi in 1203, Francis returned to his carefree life. In 1205, Francis left for Apulia to enlist in the army of Walter III, Count of Brienne. A strange vision made him return to Assisi and lose interest in worldly life. According to hagiographic accounts, thereafter he began to avoid the sports and feasts of his former companions. A friend asked him whether he was thinking of marrying, to which he answered: &quot;Yes, a fairer bride than any of you have ever seen&quot;, meaning his &quot;Lady Poverty&quot;.

On a pilgrimage to Rome, he joined the poor in begging at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. He spent some time in lonely places, asking God for divine illumination. He said he had a mystical vision of Jesus Christ in the forsaken country chapel of San Damiano, just outside Assisi, in which the Icon of Christ Crucified said to him, &quot;Francis, Francis, go and repair My church which, as you can see, is falling into ruins.&quot; He took this to mean the ruined church in which he was presently praying, and so he sold some cloth taken from his father&#x27;s store to assist the priest there. When the priest refused to accept the ill-gotten gains, an indignant Francis threw the coins on the floor.

In order to avoid his father&#x27;s wrath, Francis hid in a cave near San Damiano for about a month. When he returned to town, hungry and dirty, he was dragged home by his father, beaten, bound, and locked in a small storeroom. Freed by his mother during Bernardone&#x27;s absence, Francis returned at once to San Damiano, where he found shelter with the officiating priest, but he was soon cited before the city consuls by his father. The latter, not content with having recovered the scattered gold from San Damiano, sought also to force his son to forego his inheritance by way of restitution. In the midst of legal proceedings before the Bishop of Assisi, Francis renounced his father and his patrimony. Some accounts report that he stripped himself naked in token of this renunciation, and the bishop covered him with his own cloak.

For the next couple of months, Francis wandered as a beggar in the hills behind Assisi. He spent some time at a neighbouring monastery working as a . He then went to Gubbio, where a friend gave him, as an alms, the cloak, girdle, and staff of a pilgrim. Returning to Assisi, he traversed the city, begging stones for the restoration of St. Damiano. These he carried to the old chapel, set in place himself, and so at length rebuilt it. Over the course of two years, he embraced the life of a penitent, during which he restored several ruined chapels in the countryside around Assisi, among them San Pietro in Spina (in the area of San Petrignano in the valley about a kilometre from modern Rivotorto, on private property and once again in ruin); and the Porziuncola, the little chapel of St. Mary of the Angels in the plain just below the town. This later became his favorite abode. By degrees he took to nursing lepers, in the leper colonies near Assisi.

===Founding of the Franciscan Orders===
====Friars Minor====
One morning in February 1208, Francis was taking part in a Mass in the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels, near which he had by then built himself a hut. The Gospel of the day was the &quot;Commissioning of the Twelve&quot; from the Book of Matthew. The disciples were to go and proclaim that the Kingdom of God is at hand. Francis was inspired to devote himself to a life of poverty. Having obtained a coarse woollen tunic, the dress then worn by the poorest Umbrian peasants, he tied it around himself with a knotted rope and went about exhorting the people of the countryside to penance, brotherly love, and peace. Francis&#x27;s preaching to ordinary people was unusual as he had no license to do so.
His example attracted others. Within a year Francis had eleven followers. The brothers lived a simple life in the deserted leper colony of Rivo Torto near Assisi. They spent much of their time wandering through the mountainous districts of Umbria, making a deep impression upon their hearers by their earnest exhortations.

In 1209 he composed a simple rule for his followers (&quot;friars&quot;), the &quot;Regula primitiva&quot; or &quot;Primitive Rule&quot;, which came from verses in the Bible. The rule was &quot;to follow the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ and to walk in his footsteps.&quot; He then led eleven followers to Rome to seek permission from Pope Innocent III to found a new religious order. Upon entry to Rome, the brothers encountered Bishop Guido of Assisi, who had in his company Giovanni di San Paolo, the Cardinal Bishop of Sabina. The Cardinal, who was the confessor of Pope Innocent III, was immediately sympathetic to Francis and agreed to represent Francis to the pope. After several days, the pope agreed to admit the group informally, adding that when God increased the group in grace and number, they could return for an official audience. The group was tonsured. This was important in part because it recognized Church authority and prevented his following from accusations of heresy, as had happened to the Waldensians decades earlier. Though a number of the pope&#x27;s counsellors considered the mode of life proposed by Francis to be unsafe and impractical, following a dream in which he saw Francis holding up the Lateran Basilica, he decided to endorse Francis&#x27;s order. This occurred, according to tradition, on 16 April 1210, and constituted the official founding of the Franciscan Order. The group, then the &quot;Lesser Brothers&quot; (&quot;Order of Friars Minor&quot; also known as the &quot;Franciscan Order&quot; or the &quot;Seraphic Order&quot;), were centred in the Porziuncola and preached first in Umbria, before expanding throughout Italy. Francis was later ordained a deacon, but not a priest.

====Poor Clares and Third Order====
From then on, the new order grew quickly. Hearing Francis preaching in the church of San Rufino in Assisi in 1211, the young noblewoman Clare of Assisi sought to live like them. Her cousin Rufino also sought to join. On the night of Palm Sunday, 28 March 1212, Clare clandestinely left her family&#x27;s palace. Francis received her at the Porziuncola and thereby established the Order of Poor Clares. He gave Clare a religious habit, a garment similar to his own, before lodging her, her younger sister Caterina, and other young women in a nearby monastery of Benedictine nuns until he could provide a suitable monastery. Later he transferred them to San Damiano, to a few small huts or cells. This became the first monastery of the Second Franciscan Order, now known as Poor Clares.

For those who could not leave their affairs, Francis later formed the Third Order of Brothers and Sisters of Penance, a fraternity composed of either laity or clergy whose members neither withdrew from the world nor took religious vows. Instead, they observed the principles of Franciscan life in their daily lives. Before long, the Third Order – now titled the Secular Franciscan Order – grew beyond Italy.

===Travels===
Determined to bring the Gospel to all peoples and let God convert them, Francis sought on several occasions to take his message out of Italy. In approximately 1211, a captain of the Medrano family held the lordship of the castle and town of Agoncillo, situated near the city of Logroño, in the region of La Rioja, Spain. Medrano&#x27;s son was suffering from a mysterious and untreatable ailment. In 1211, Saint Francis of Assisi roamed those very paths of Agoncillo. In a saintly manner, he visited Medrano&#x27;s Agoncillo castle, placed his mystical hands upon the ailing boy, and miraculously healed him, securing the Medrano lineage in Agoncillo. 

The Medrano family generously donated some land, including a tower, situated close to the Ebro River within the city of Logroño as a gift to Saint Francis, where he established the first Spanish convent of his Order there. As a result, the Medrano family, lords of Agoncillo, are distinguished by their devotion to Saint Francis of Assisi. The House of Medrano became perpetual ecclesiastical patrons of the chapel in his Franciscan Monastery of Logroño. Although the convent met its demise in the 19th century, the remnants of its walls remain. 

===Missionary work during the 5th Crusade===
In the late spring of 1212, he set out for Jerusalem, but was shipwrecked by a storm on the Dalmatian coast, forcing him to return to Italy. On 8 May 1213, he was given the use of the mountain of La Verna (Alverna) as a gift from Count Orlando di Chiusi, who described it as &quot;eminently suitable for whoever wishes to do penance in a place remote from mankind&quot;. The mountain would become one of his favourite retreats for prayer.

During the Fifth Crusade in 1219 Francis went to Egypt where a Crusader army had been encamped for over a year besieging the walled city of Damietta. He was accompanied by Friar Illuminatus of Arce and hoped to convert the Sultan of Egypt or be martyred in the attempt. The Sultan, al-Kamil, a nephew of Saladin, had succeeded his father as Sultan of Egypt in 1218 and was encamped upstream of Damietta. A bloody and futile attack on the city was launched by the Christians on 29 August 1219, following which both sides agreed to a ceasefire that lasted four weeks. Probably during this interlude Francis and his companion crossed the Muslims&#x27; lines and were brought before the Sultan, remaining in his camp for a few days. Reports give no information about what transpired during the encounter beyond noting that the Sultan received Francis graciously and that Francis preached to the Muslims. He returned unharmed. No known Arab sources mention the visit.
Such an incident is alluded to in a scene in the late 13th-century fresco cycle, attributed to Giotto, in the upper basilica at Assisi.

According to some late sources, the Sultan gave Francis permission to visit the sacred places in the Holy Land and even to preach there. All that can safely be asserted is that Francis and his companion left the Crusader camp for Acre, from where they embarked for Italy in the latter half of 1220. Drawing on a 1267 sermon by Bonaventure, later sources report that the Sultan secretly converted or accepted a death-bed baptism as a result of meeting Francis.

Whatever transpired as a result of Francis’ and al-Kamil’s meeting the Franciscans have maintained a presence in the Holy Land almost uninterrupted since 1217 and remain there (see Custody of the Holy Land). They received concessions from the Mameluke Sultan in 1333 with regard to certain Holy Places in Jerusalem and Bethlehem, and (so far as concerns the Catholic Church) jurisdictional privileges from Pope Clement VI in 1342.

===Reorganization of the Franciscan Order===
 The growing order of friars was divided into provinces; groups were sent to France, Germany, Hungary, and Spain and to the East. Upon receiving a report of the martyrdom of five brothers in Morocco, Francis returned to Italy via Venice. Cardinal Ugolino di Conti was then nominated by the pope as the protector of the order. Another reason for Francis&#x27; return to Italy was that the Franciscan Order had grown at an unprecedented rate compared to previous religious orders, but its organizational sophistication had not kept up with this growth and had little more to govern it than Francis&#x27; example and simple rule. To address this problem, Francis prepared a new and more detailed Rule, the &quot;First Rule&quot; or &quot;Rule Without a Papal Bull&quot; (&quot;Regula prima&quot;, &quot;Regula non bullata&quot;), which again asserted devotion to poverty and the apostolic life. However, it also introduced a greater institutional structure, though this was never officially endorsed by the pope.

Brother Peter was succeeded by Brother Elias as Vicar of Francis. Two years later, Francis modified the &quot;First Rule&quot;, creating the &quot;Second Rule&quot; or &quot;Rule With a Bull&quot;, which was approved by Pope Honorius III on 29 November 1223. As the order&#x27;s official rule, it called on the friars &quot;to observe the Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, living in obedience without anything of our own and in chastity&quot;. In addition, it set regulations for discipline, preaching, and entering the order. Once the rule was endorsed by the pope, Francis withdrew increasingly from external affairs. During 1221 and 1222, he crossed Italy, first as far south as Catania in Sicily and afterwards as far north as Bologna.

=== Stigmata, final days, and sainthood ===
While he was praying on the mountain of Verna, during a forty-day fast in preparation for Michaelmas (29 September), Francis is said to have had a vision on September 17, 1224, three days after the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, as a result of which he received the stigmata. Brother Leo, who had been with Francis at the time, left a clear and simple account of the event, the first definite account of the phenomenon of stigmata. &quot;Suddenly he saw a vision of a seraph, a six-winged angel on a cross. This angel gave him the gift of the five wounds of Christ.&quot; Suffering from these stigmata and from trachoma, Francis received care in several cities (Siena, Cortona, Nocera) to no avail. He began to go blind and the bishop of Ostia ordered that his eyes be operated on which meant cauterizing the eyes with hot irons. Francis claims to have felt nothing at all when this was done. In the end, he was brought back to a hut next to the Porziuncola. Here he spent his last days dictating his spiritual testament. He died on the evening of Saturday, 3 October 1226, singing Psalm 141, &quot;Voce mea ad Dominum&quot;.

On 16 July 1228, he was declared a saint by Pope Gregory IX (the former cardinal Ugolino di Conti, a friend of Francis and Cardinal Protector of the Order). The next day, the pope laid the foundation stone for the Basilica of St. Francis in Assisi. Francis was buried on 25 May 1230, under the Lower Basilica, but his tomb was soon hidden on orders of Brother Elias, in order to protect it from Saracen invaders. His burial place remained unknown until it was rediscovered in 1818. Pasquale Belli then constructed a crypt for the remains in the Lower Basilica. It was refashioned between 1927 and 1930 into its present form by Ugo Tarchi. In 1978, the remains of Francis were examined and confirmed by a commission of scholars appointed by Pope Paul VI, and put into a glass urn in the ancient stone tomb.

In 1935, Dr. Edward Frederick Hartung concluded that Francis contracted trachoma while in Egypt and died of quartan malaria. This data was published in the &quot;Annals of Medical History&quot;.

==Character and legacy==
Francis set out to replicate Christ and literally carry out his work. This is important in understanding Francis&#x27; character, his affinity for the Eucharist and his respect for the priests who carried out the sacrament. He preached: &quot;Your God is of your flesh, He lives in your nearest neighbour, in every man.&quot;

He and his followers celebrated and even venerated poverty, which was so central to his character that in his last written work, the Testament, he said that absolute personal and corporate poverty was the essential lifestyle for the members of his order.

He believed that nature itself was the mirror of God. He called all creatures his &quot;brothers&quot; and &quot;sisters&quot;, and even preached to the birds and supposedly persuaded a wolf in Gubbio to stop attacking some locals if they agreed to feed the wolf. His deep sense of brotherhood under God embraced others, and he declared that &quot;he considered himself no friend of Christ if he did not cherish those for whom Christ died&quot;.

Francis&#x27;s visit to Egypt and attempted rapprochement with the Muslim world had far-reaching consequences, long past his own death, since after the fall of the Crusader Kingdom, it would be the Franciscans, of all Catholics, who would be allowed to stay on in the Holy Land and be recognized as &quot;Custodians of the Holy Land&quot; on behalf of the Catholic Church.

At Greccio near Assisi, around 1220, Francis celebrated Christmas by setting up the first known &quot;presepio&quot; or &quot;crèche&quot; (Nativity scene). His nativity imagery reflected the scene in traditional paintings. He used real animals to create a living scene so that the worshipers could contemplate the birth of the child Jesus in a direct way, making use of the senses, especially sight. Both Thomas of Celano and Bonaventure, biographers of Francis, tell how he used only a straw-filled manger (feeding trough) set between a real ox and donkey. According to Thomas, it was beautiful in its simplicity, with the manger acting as the altar for the Christmas Mass.

Some modern commentators and animal rights advocates have mistakenly portrayed Francis as a vegetarian. However, historical records indicate that he did consume meat, and his earliest biographers make no mention of him adhering to a meatless diet. Francis&#x27;s favourite dish was shrimp pie.

===Nature and the environment===
Francis preached the Christian doctrine that the world was created good and beautiful by God but suffers a need for redemption because of human sin. As someone who saw God reflected in nature, &quot;St. Francis was a great lover of God&#x27;s creation ...&quot; In the Canticle of the Sun he gives God thanks for Brother Sun, Sister Moon, Brother Wind, Water, Fire, and Earth, all of which he sees as rendering praise to God.

Many of the stories that surround the life of Francis say that he had a great love for animals and the environment. The &quot;Fioretti&quot; (&quot;Little Flowers&quot;) is a collection of legends and folklore that sprang up after his death. One account describes how one day, while Francis was travelling with some companions, they happened upon a place in the road where birds filled the trees on either side. Francis told his companions to &quot;wait for me while I go to preach to my sisters the birds.&quot; The birds surrounded him, intrigued by the power of his voice, and not one of them flew away. He is often portrayed with a bird, typically in his hand.

Another legend from the &quot;Fioretti&quot; tells that in the city of Gubbio, where Francis lived for some time, was a wolf &quot;terrifying and ferocious, who devoured men as well as animals&quot;. Francis went up into the hills and when he found the wolf, he made the sign of the cross and commanded the wolf to come to him and hurt no one. Then Francis led the wolf into the town, and surrounded by startled citizens made a pact between them and the wolf. Because the wolf had &quot;done evil out of hunger&quot;, the townsfolk were to feed the wolf regularly. In return, the wolf would no longer prey upon them or their flocks. In this manner Gubbio was freed from the menace of the predator.

On 29 November 1979, Pope John Paul II declared Francis the patron saint of ecology. On 28 March 1982, John Paul II said that Francis&#x27; love and care for creation was a challenge for contemporary Catholics and a reminder &quot;not to behave like dissident predators where nature is concerned, but to assume responsibility for it, taking all care so that everything stays healthy and integrated, so as to offer a welcoming and friendly environment even to those who succeed us.&quot; The same Pope wrote on the occasion of the World Day of Peace, 1 January 1990, that Francis &quot;invited all of creation – animals, plants, natural forces, even Brother Sun and Sister Moon – to give honour and praise to the Lord. The poor man of Assisi gives us striking witness that when we are at peace with God we are better able to devote ourselves to building up that peace with all creation which is inseparable from peace among all peoples.&quot;

In 2015, Pope Francis published his encyclical letter Laudato Si&#x27; about the ecological crisis and &quot;care for our common home, which takes its name from the Canticle of the Sun, which Francis of Assisi composed. It presents Francis as &quot;the example par excellence of care for the vulnerable and of an integral ecology lived out joyfully and authentically&quot;. This inspired the birth of the Laudato Si&#x27; Movement, a global network of nearly 1000 organizations promoting the Laudato Si&#x27; message and the Franciscan approach to ecology.

===Feast day===

Francis&#x27; feast day is observed on 4 October. A secondary feast in honour of the stigmata received by Francis, celebrated on 17 September, was inserted in the General Roman Calendar in 1585 (later than the Tridentine calendar) and suppressed in 1604, but was restored in 1615. In the New Roman Missal of 1969, it was removed again from the General Calendar, as something of a duplication of the main feast on 4 October, and left to the calendars of certain localities and of the Franciscan Order. Wherever the Tridentine Missal is used, however, the feast of the Stigmata remains in the General Calendar.

Francis is honoured with a Lesser Festival in the Church of England, the Anglican Church of Canada, the Episcopal Church USA, the Old Catholic Churches, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and other churches and religious communities on 4 October.

It is a popular practice on Francis&#x27; feast day for people to bring their pets and other animals to church for a blessing.

===Papal name===
On 13 March 2013, upon his election as Pope, Archbishop and Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina chose Francis as his papal name in honor of Francis of Assisi, becoming Pope Francis.

At his first audience on 16 March 2013, Pope Francis told journalists that he had chosen the name in honor of Francis of Assisi, and had done so because he was especially concerned for the well-being of the poor. The pontiff recounted that Cardinal Cláudio Hummes had told him, &quot;Don&#x27;t forget the poor&quot;, right after the election; that made Bergoglio think of Francis. It is the first time a pope has taken the name.

===Patronage===
On 18 June 1939, Pope Pius XII named Francis a joint patron saint of Italy along with Catherine of Siena with the apostolic letter &quot;Licet Commissa&quot;. Pope Pius also mentioned the two saints in the laudative discourse he pronounced on 5 May 1949, in the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva.

Francis is the patron of animals and ecology. As such, he is the patron saint of the Laudato Si&#x27; Movement, a network that promotes the Franciscan ecological paradigm as outlined in the encyclical Laudato Si&#x27;.

He is also considered the patron against dying alone; against fire; patron of the Franciscan Order and Catholic Action; of families, peace, and needleworkers. and a number of religious congregations.

He is the patron of many churches and other locations around the world, including: Italy; San Pawl il-Baħar, Malta; Freising, Germany; Lancaster, England; Kottapuram, India; Buhi, Camarines Sur, Philippines; General Trias, Philippines; San Francisco; Santa Fe, New Mexico; Colorado; Salina, Kansas; Metuchen, New Jersey; and Quibdó, Colombia.

===Outside Catholicism===
====Anglicanism====

One of the results of the Oxford Movement in the Anglican Church during the 19th century was the re-establishment of religious orders, including some of Franciscan inspiration. The principal Anglican communities in the Franciscan tradition are the Community of St. Francis (women, founded 1905), the Poor Clares of Reparation (P.C.R.), the Society of St. Francis (men, founded 1934), and the Community of St. Clare (women, enclosed).

A U.S.-founded order within the Anglican world communion is the Seattle-founded order of Clares in Seattle (Diocese of Olympia), The Little Sisters of St. Clare.

The Anglican church retained the Catholic tradition of blessing animals on or near Francis&#x27; feast day of 4 October, and more recently Lutheran and other Protestant churches have adopted the practice.

====Protestantism====

Several Protestant groups have emerged since the 19th century that strive to adhere to the teachings of St. Francis.

There are also some small Franciscan communities within European Protestantism and the Old Catholic Church. There are some Franciscan orders in Lutheran Churches, including the Order of Lutheran Franciscans, the Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary, and the Evangelische Kanaan Franziskus-Bruderschaft (Kanaan Franciscan Brothers).

====Orthodox churches====
Francis is not officially recognized as a saint by any Orthodox Church and the Orthodox Church has not pronounced any official view on the stigmata. Orthodox Saint, bishop, and theologian Ignatius Brianchaninov referred to a particular hagiographer of Francis of Assisi as being in delusion:

&quot;As an example of a book written in the state of delusion called opinion, we cite the following: &#x27;When Francis was caught up to heaven,&#x27; says a writer of his life, &#x27;God the Father, on seeing him, was for a moment in doubt to as [sic] to whom to give the preference, to His Son by nature, or to His son by grace-Francis.&#x27; What can be more frightful or madder than this blasphemy, what can be sadder than this delusion?&quot;. 

Francis of Assisi received limited veneration by Orthodox Christians in the Middle Ages, and there are Orthodox icons of him at the Church of Panagia Kera at Kritsa, in Crete.

Francis&#x27; feast is celebrated at New Skete, an Eastern Orthodox monastic community in Cambridge, New York founded by Catholic Franciscans in the 20th century.

St. Joseph the Hesychast had Francis as his baptismal name, and the Greek tradition always requires Saint&#x27;s names to be taken at baptism.

Romanian Orthodox priest, iconographer, and saint, Arsenie Boca painted an icon of Saints in Draganescu Church, which included St. Francis of Assisi.

====Other religions====

Outside of Christianity, other individuals and movements are influenced by the example and teachings of Francis. These include the popular philosopher Eckhart Tolle, who has made videos on the spirituality of Francis.

The interreligious spiritual community of Skanda Vale in Wales also takes inspiration from the example of Francis, and models itself as an interfaith Franciscan order.

===Main writings===

* &quot;Canticum Fratris Solis&quot; or &quot;Laudes Creaturarum&quot;; Canticle of the Sun, 1224
* &quot;Oratio ante Crucifixum&quot;, Prayer before the Crucifix, 1205 (extant in the original Umbrian dialect as well as in a contemporary Latin translation)
* &quot;Regula non bullata&quot;, the Earlier Rule, 1221
* &quot;Regula bullata&quot;, the Later Rule, 1223
* &quot;Testament&quot;, 1226

For a complete list, see &quot;The Franciscan Experience&quot;.

Francis is considered the first Italian poet by some literary critics. He believed commoners should be able to pray to God in their own language, and he wrote often in the dialect of Umbria instead of Latin.

The anonymous 20th-century prayer &quot;Make Me an Instrument of Your Peace&quot; is widely attributed to Francis, but there is no evidence for it.
==In art==
The Franciscan Order promoted devotion to the life of Francis from his canonization onwards, and Francis appeared in European art soon after his death. The order commissioned many works for Franciscan churches, either showing him with sacred figures or episodes from his life. There are large early fresco cycles in the Basilica of San Francesco d&#x27;Assisi, parts of which are shown above.

There are countless seventeenth- and eighteenth-century depictions of Saint Francis of Assisi and a musical angel in churches and museums throughout western Europe. The titles of these depictions vary widely, at times describing Francis as &quot;consoled&quot;, &quot;comforted&quot;, in &quot;ecstasy&quot; or in &quot;rapture&quot;; the presence of the musical angel may or may not be mentioned.

<text>The General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon is an American single-engine supersonic multirole fighter aircraft originally developed by General Dynamics for the United States Air Force (USAF). Designed as an air superiority day fighter, it evolved into a successful all-weather multirole aircraft with over 4,600 built since 1976. Although no longer purchased by the U.S. Air Force, improved versions are being built for export. In 1993, General Dynamics sold its aircraft manufacturing business to the Lockheed Corporation, which became part of Lockheed Martin after a 1995 merger with Martin Marietta.

The F-16&#x27;s key features include a frameless bubble canopy for enhanced cockpit visibility, a side-mounted control stick to ease control while maneuvering, an ejection seat reclined 30 degrees from vertical to reduce the effect of g-forces on the pilot, and the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire flight control system that helps to make it an agile aircraft. The fighter has a single turbofan engine, an internal M61 Vulcan cannon and 11 hardpoints. Although officially named &quot;Fighting Falcon&quot;, the aircraft is commonly known by the nickname &quot;Viper&quot; among its crews and pilots.

In addition to active duty in the U.S. Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command, and Air National Guard units, the aircraft is also used by the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds aerial demonstration team, the US Air Combat Command F-16 Viper Demonstration Team, and as an adversary/aggressor aircraft by the United States Navy. The F-16 has also been procured by the air forces of 25 other nations. As of 2024, it is the world&#x27;s most common fixed-wing aircraft in military service, with 2,145 F-16s operational.

==Development==
===Lightweight Fighter program===
US Vietnam War experience showed the need for air superiority fighters and better air-to-air training for fighter pilots. Based on his experience in the Korean War and as a fighter tactics instructor in the early 1960s, Colonel John Boyd with mathematician Thomas Christie developed the energy–maneuverability theory to model a fighter aircraft&#x27;s performance in combat. Boyd&#x27;s work called for a small, lightweight aircraft that could maneuver with the minimum possible energy loss and which also incorporated an increased thrust-to-weight ratio. In the late 1960s, Boyd gathered a group of like-minded innovators who became known as the Fighter Mafia, and in 1969, they secured Department of Defense funding for General Dynamics and Northrop to study design concepts based on the theory.

Air Force F-X proponents were opposed to the concept because they perceived it as a threat to the F-15 program, but the USAF&#x27;s leadership understood that its budget would not allow it to purchase enough F-15 aircraft to satisfy all of its missions. The Advanced Day Fighter concept, renamed &quot;F-XX&quot;, gained civilian political support under the reform-minded Deputy Secretary of Defense David Packard, who favored the idea of competitive prototyping. As a result, in May 1971, the Air Force Prototype Study Group was established, with Boyd a key member, and two of its six proposals would be funded, one being the Lightweight Fighter (LWF). The request for proposals issued on 6 January 1972 called for a class air-to-air day fighter with a good turn rate, acceleration, and range, and optimized for combat at speeds of and altitudes of . This was the region where USAF studies predicted most future air combat would occur. The anticipated average flyaway cost of a production version was . This production plan was hypothetical as the USAF had no firm plans to procure the winner.

====Selection of finalists and flyoff====
Five companies responded, and in 1972, the Air Staff selected General Dynamics&#x27; Model 401 and Northrop&#x27;s P-600 for the follow-on prototype development and testing phase. GD and Northrop were awarded contracts worth and to produce the YF-16 and YF-17, respectively, with the first flights of both prototypes planned for early 1974. To overcome resistance in the Air Force hierarchy, the Fighter Mafia and other LWF proponents successfully advocated the idea of complementary fighters in a high-cost/low-cost force mix. The &quot;high/low mix&quot; would allow the USAF to be able to afford sufficient fighters for its overall fighter force structure requirements. The mix gained broad acceptance by the time of the prototypes&#x27; flyoff, defining the relationship between the LWF and the F-15.

The YF-16 was developed by a team of General Dynamics engineers led by Robert H. Widmer. The first YF-16 was rolled out on 13 December 1973. Its 90-minute maiden flight was made at the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, California, on 2 February 1974. Its actual first flight occurred accidentally during a high-speed taxi test on 20 January 1974. While gathering speed, a roll-control oscillation caused a fin of the port-side wingtip-mounted missile and then the starboard stabilator to scrape the ground, and the aircraft then began to veer off the runway. The test pilot, Phil Oestricher, decided to lift off to avoid a potential crash, safely landing six minutes later. The slight damage was quickly repaired and the official first flight occurred on time. The YF-16&#x27;s first supersonic flight was accomplished on 5 February 1974, and the second YF-16 prototype first flew on 9 May 1974. This was followed by the first flights of Northrop&#x27;s YF-17 prototypes on 9 June and 21 August 1974, respectively. During the flyoff, the YF-16s completed 330 sorties for a total of 417 flight hours; the YF-17s flew 288 sorties, covering 345 hours.

===Air Combat Fighter competition===
Increased interest turned the LWF into a serious acquisition program. NATO allies Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway were seeking to replace their F-104G Starfighter fighter-bombers. In early 1974, they reached an agreement with the U.S. that if the USAF ordered the LWF winner, they would consider ordering it as well. The USAF also needed to replace its F-105 Thunderchief and F-4 Phantom II fighter-bombers. The U.S. Congress sought greater commonality in fighter procurements by the Air Force and Navy, and in August 1974 redirected Navy funds to a new Navy Air Combat Fighter program that would be a naval fighter-bomber variant of the LWF. The four NATO allies had formed the Multinational Fighter Program Group (MFPG) and pressed for a U.S. decision by December 1974; thus, the USAF accelerated testing.
To reflect this serious intent to procure a new fighter-bomber, the LWF program was rolled into a new Air Combat Fighter (ACF) competition in an announcement by U.S. Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger in April 1974. The ACF would not be a pure fighter, but multirole, and Schlesinger made it clear that any ACF order would be in addition to the F-15, which extinguished opposition to the LWF. ACF also raised the stakes for GD and Northrop because it brought in competitors intent on securing what was touted at the time as &quot;the arms deal of the century&quot;. These were Dassault-Breguet&#x27;s proposed Mirage F1M-53, the Anglo-French SEPECAT Jaguar, and the proposed Saab 37E &quot;Eurofighter&quot;. Northrop offered the P-530 Cobra, which was similar to the YF-17. The Jaguar and Cobra were dropped by the MFPG early on, leaving two European and two U.S. candidates. On 11 September 1974, the U.S. Air Force confirmed plans to order the winning ACF design to equip five tactical fighter wings. Though computer modeling predicted a close contest, the YF-16 proved significantly quicker going from one maneuver to the next and was the unanimous choice of those pilots that flew both aircraft.

On 13 January 1975, Secretary of the Air Force John L. McLucas announced the YF-16 as the winner of the ACF competition. The chief reasons given by the secretary were the YF-16&#x27;s lower operating costs, greater range, and maneuver performance that was &quot;significantly better&quot; than that of the YF-17, especially at supersonic speeds. Another advantage of the YF-16 – unlike the YF-17 – was its use of the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 turbofan engine, the same powerplant used by the F-15; such commonality would lower the cost of engines for both programs. Secretary McLucas announced that the USAF planned to order at least 650, possibly up to 1,400 production F-16s. In the Navy Air Combat Fighter competition, on 2 May 1975, the Navy selected the YF-17 as the basis for what would become the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet.

===Production===
The U.S. Air Force initially ordered 15 full-scale development (FSD) aircraft (11 single-seat and four two-seat models) for its flight test program which was reduced to eight (six F-16A single-seaters and two F-16B two-seaters). The YF-16 design was altered for the production F-16. The fuselage was lengthened by , a larger nose radome was fitted for the AN/APG-66 radar, wing area was increased from , the tailfin height was decreased, the ventral fins were enlarged, two more stores stations were added, and a single door replaced the original nosewheel double doors. The F-16&#x27;s weight was increased by 25% over the YF-16 by these modifications.

The FSD F-16s were manufactured by General Dynamics in Fort Worth, Texas, at United States Air Force Plant 4 in late 1975; the first F-16A rolled out on 20 October 1976 and first flew on 8 December. The initial two-seat model achieved its first flight on 8 August 1977. The initial production-standard F-16A flew for the first time on 7 August 1978 and its delivery was accepted by the USAF on 6 January 1979. The aircraft entered USAF operational service with the 34th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 388th Tactical Fighter Wing, at Hill AFB in Utah, on 1 October 1980.

The F-16 was given its name of &quot;Fighting Falcon&quot; on 21 July 1980. Its pilots and crews often use the name &quot;Viper&quot; instead, because of a perceived resemblance to a viper snake as well as to the fictional Colonial Viper starfighter from the television program &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, which aired at the time the F-16 entered service.

On 7 June 1975, the four European partners, now known as the European Participation Group, signed up for 348 aircraft at the Paris Air Show. This was split among the European Participation Air Forces (EPAF) as 116 for Belgium, 58 for Denmark, 102 for the Netherlands, and 72 for Norway. Two European production lines, one in the Netherlands at Fokker&#x27;s Schiphol-Oost facility and the other at SABCA&#x27;s Gosselies plant in Belgium, would produce 184 and 164 units respectively. Norway&#x27;s Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk and Denmark&#x27;s Terma A/S also manufactured parts and subassemblies for EPAF aircraft. European co-production was officially launched on 1 July 1977 at the Fokker factory. Beginning in November 1977, Fokker-produced components were sent to Fort Worth for fuselage assembly, then shipped back to Europe for final assembly of EPAF aircraft at the Belgian plant on 15 February 1978; deliveries to the Belgian Air Force began in January 1979. The first Royal Netherlands Air Force aircraft was delivered in June 1979. In 1980, the first aircraft were delivered to the Royal Norwegian Air Force by Fokker and to the Royal Danish Air Force by SABCA.

During the late 1980s and 1990s, Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) produced 232 Block 30/40/50 F-16s on a production line in Ankara under license for the Turkish Air Force. TAI also produced 46 Block 40s for Egypt in the mid-1990s and 30 Block 50s from 2010 onwards. Korean Aerospace Industries opened a production line for the KF-16 program, producing 140 Block 52s from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s (decade). If India had selected the F-16IN for its Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft procurement, a sixth F-16 production line would have been built in India. In May 2013, Lockheed Martin stated there were currently enough orders to keep producing the F-16 until 2017.

===Improvements and upgrades===
One change made during production was augmented pitch control to avoid deep stall conditions at high angles of attack. The stall issue had been raised during development but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated a real concern. In response, the area of each horizontal stabilizer was increased by 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.

In the 1980s, the Multinational Staged Improvement Program (MSIP) was conducted to evolve the F-16&#x27;s capabilities, mitigate risks during technology development, and ensure the aircraft&#x27;s worth. The program upgraded the F-16 in three stages. The MSIP process permitted the quick introduction of new capabilities, at lower costs and with reduced risks compared to traditional independent upgrade programs. In 2012, the USAF had allocated $2.8 billion (~$ in ) to upgrade 350 F-16s while waiting for the F-35 to enter service. One key upgrade has been an auto-GCAS (Ground collision avoidance system) to reduce instances of controlled flight into terrain. Onboard power and cooling capacities limit the scope of upgrades, which often involve the addition of more power-hungry avionics.

Lockheed won many contracts to upgrade foreign operators&#x27; F-16s. BAE Systems also offers various F-16 upgrades, receiving orders from South Korea, Oman, Turkey, and the US Air National Guard; BAE lost the South Korean contract because of a price breach in November 2014. In 2012, the USAF assigned the total upgrade contract to Lockheed Martin. Upgrades include Raytheon&#x27;s Center Display Unit, which replaces several analog flight instruments with a single digital display.

In 2013, sequestration budget cuts cast doubt on the USAF&#x27;s ability to complete the Combat Avionics Programmed Extension Suite (CAPES), a part of secondary programs such as Taiwan&#x27;s F-16 upgrade. Air Combat Command&#x27;s General Mike Hostage stated that if he only had money for a service life extension program (SLEP) or CAPES, he would fund SLEP to keep the aircraft flying. Lockheed Martin responded to talk of CAPES cancellation with a fixed-price upgrade package for foreign users. CAPES was not included in the Pentagon&#x27;s 2015 budget request. The USAF said that the upgrade package will still be offered to Taiwan&#x27;s Republic of China Air Force, and Lockheed said that some common elements with the F-35 will keep the radar&#x27;s unit costs down. In 2014, the USAF issued a RFI to SLEP 300 F-16 C/Ds.

===Production relocation===
To make more room for assembly of its newer F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft, Lockheed Martin moved the F-16 production from Fort Worth, Texas to its plant in Greenville, South Carolina. Lockheed delivered the last F-16 from Fort Worth to the Iraqi Air Force on 14 November 2017, ending 40 years of F-16 production there. The company resumed production in 2019, though engineering and modernization work will remain in Fort Worth. A gap in orders made it possible to stop production during the move; after completing orders for the last Iraqi purchase, the company was negotiating an F-16 sale to Bahrain that would be produced in Greenville. This contract was signed in June 2018, and the first planes rolled off the Greenville line in 2023.

==Design==

===Overview===
The F-16 is a single-engine, highly maneuverable, supersonic, multirole tactical fighter aircraft. It is much smaller and lighter than its predecessors but uses advanced aerodynamics and avionics, including the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire (RSS/FBW) flight control system, to achieve enhanced maneuver performance. Highly agile, the F-16 was the first fighter aircraft purpose-built to pull 9-&quot;g&quot; maneuvers and can reach a maximum speed of over Mach 2. Innovations include a frameless bubble canopy for better visibility, a side-mounted control stick, and a reclined seat to reduce g-force effects on the pilot. It is armed with an internal 20 mm M61 Vulcan cannon in the left wing root and has multiple locations for mounting various missiles, bombs and pods. It has a thrust-to-weight ratio greater than one, providing power to climb and vertical acceleration.

The F-16 was designed to be relatively inexpensive to build and simpler to maintain than earlier-generation fighters. The airframe is built with about 80% aviation-grade aluminum alloys, 8% steel, 3% composites, and 1.5% titanium. The leading-edge flaps, stabilators, and ventral fins make use of bonded aluminum honeycomb structures and graphite epoxy lamination coatings. The number of lubrication points, fuel line connections, and replaceable modules is significantly less than in preceding fighters; 80% of the access panels can be accessed without stands. The air intake was placed so it was rearward of the nose but forward enough to minimize air flow losses and reduce aerodynamic drag.

Although the LWF program called for a structural life of 4,000 flight hours, capable of achieving with 80% internal fuel; GD&#x27;s engineers decided to design the F-16&#x27;s airframe life for 8,000 hours and for maneuvers on full internal fuel. This proved advantageous when the aircraft&#x27;s mission changed from solely air-to-air combat to multirole operations. Changes in operational use and additional systems have increased weight, necessitating multiple structural strengthening programs.

===General configuration===
The F-16 has a cropped-delta wing incorporating wing-fuselage blending and forebody vortex-control strakes; a fixed-geometry, underslung air intake (with splitter plate) to the single turbofan jet engine; a conventional tri-plane empennage arrangement with all-moving horizontal &quot;stabilator&quot; tailplanes; a pair of ventral fins beneath the fuselage aft of the wing&#x27;s trailing edge; and a tricycle landing gear configuration with the aft-retracting, steerable nose gear deploying a short distance behind the inlet lip. There is a boom-style aerial refueling receptacle located behind the single-piece &quot;bubble&quot; canopy of the cockpit. Split-flap speedbrakes are located at the aft end of the wing-body fairing, and a tailhook is mounted underneath the fuselage. A fairing beneath the rudder often houses ECM equipment or a drag chute. Later F-16 models feature a long dorsal fairing along the fuselage&#x27;s &quot;spine&quot;, housing additional equipment or fuel.

Aerodynamic studies in the 1960s demonstrated that the &quot;vortex lift&quot; phenomenon could be harnessed by highly swept wing configurations to reach higher angles of attack, using leading edge vortex flow off a slender lifting surface. As the F-16 was being optimized for high combat agility, GD&#x27;s designers chose a slender cropped-delta wing with a leading-edge sweep of 40° and a straight trailing edge. To improve maneuverability, a variable-camber wing with a NACA 64A-204 airfoil was selected; the camber is adjusted by leading-edge and trailing edge flaperons linked to a digital flight control system regulating the flight envelope. The F-16 has a moderate wing loading, reduced by fuselage lift. The vortex lift effect is increased by leading-edge extensions, known as strakes. Strakes act as additional short-span, triangular wings running from the wing root (the junction with the fuselage) to a point further forward on the fuselage. Blended into the fuselage and along the wing root, the strake generates a high-speed vortex that remains attached to the top of the wing as the angle of attack increases, generating additional lift and allowing greater angles of attack without stalling. Strakes allow a smaller, lower-aspect-ratio wing, which increases roll rates and directional stability while decreasing weight. Deeper wing roots also increase structural strength and internal fuel volume.

===Armament===
Early F-16s could be armed with up to six AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking short-range air-to-air missiles (AAM) by employing rail launchers on each wingtip, as well as radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrow medium-range AAMs in a weapons mix. More recent versions support the AIM-120 AMRAAM, and US aircraft often mount that missile on their wingtips to reduce wing flutter. The aircraft can carry various other AAMs, a wide variety of air-to-ground missiles, rockets or bombs; electronic countermeasures (ECM), navigation, targeting or weapons pods; and fuel tanks on 9 hardpoints – six under the wings, two on wingtips, and one under the fuselage. Two other locations under the fuselage are available for sensor or radar pods. The F-16 carries a  M61A1 Vulcan cannon, which is mounted inside the fuselage to the left of the cockpit.

===Relaxed stability and fly-by-wire===
The F-16 is the first production fighter aircraft intentionally designed to be slightly aerodynamically unstable, also known as relaxed static stability (RSS), to both reduce drag and improve maneuverability. Most aircraft are designed to have positive static stability, which induces the aircraft to return to straight and level flight attitude if the pilot releases the controls. This reduces maneuverability as the inherent stability has to be overcome and increases a form of drag known as trim drag. Aircraft with &quot;relaxed&quot; stability are designed to be able to augment their stability characteristics while maneuvering to increase lift and reduce drag, thus greatly increasing their maneuverability. At , the F-16 gains positive stability because of aerodynamic changes.

To counter the tendency to depart from controlled flight and avoid the need for constant trim inputs by the pilot, the F-16 has a quadruplex (four-channel) fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system (FLCS). The flight control computer (FLCC) accepts pilot input from the stick and rudder controls and manipulates the control surfaces in such a way as to produce the desired result without inducing control loss. The FLCC conducts thousands of measurements per second on the aircraft&#x27;s flight attitude to automatically counter deviations from the pilot-set flight path. The FLCC further incorporates limiters governing movement in the three main axes based on attitude, airspeed, and angle of attack (AOA)/&quot;g&quot;; these prevent control surfaces from inducing instability such as slips or skids, or a high AOA inducing a stall. The limiters also prevent maneuvers that would exert more than a load.

Flight testing revealed that &quot;assaulting&quot; multiple limiters at high AOA and low speed can result in an AOA far exceeding the 25° limit, colloquially referred to as &quot;departing&quot;; this causes a deep stall; a near-freefall at 50° to 60° AOA, either upright or inverted. While at a very high AOA, the aircraft&#x27;s attitude is stable but control surfaces are ineffective. The pitch limiter locks the stabilators at an extreme pitch-up or pitch-down attempting to recover. This can be overridden so the pilot can &quot;rock&quot; the nose via pitch control to recover.

Unlike the YF-17, which had hydromechanical controls serving as a backup to the FBW, General Dynamics took the innovative step of eliminating mechanical linkages from the control stick and rudder pedals to the flight control surfaces. The F-16 is entirely reliant on its electrical systems to relay flight commands, instead of traditional mechanically linked controls, leading to the early moniker of &quot;the electric jet&quot; and aphorisms among pilots such as &quot;You don&#x27;t fly an F-16; it flies you.&quot; The quadruplex design permits &quot;graceful degradation&quot; in flight control response in that the loss of one channel renders the FLCS a &quot;triplex&quot; system. The FLCC began as an analog system on the A/B variants but has been supplanted by a digital computer system beginning with the F-16C/D Block 40. The F-16&#x27;s controls suffered from a sensitivity to static electricity or electrostatic discharge (ESD) and lightning. Up to 70–80% of the C/D models&#x27; electronics were vulnerable to ESD.

===Cockpit and ergonomics===
A key feature of the F-16&#x27;s cockpit is the exceptional field of view. The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate bubble canopy provides 360° all-round visibility, with a 40° look-down angle over the side of the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot&#x27;s seat is elevated for this purpose. Additionally, the F-16&#x27;s canopy omits the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot&#x27;s forward vision. The F-16&#x27;s ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30°; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13–15°. The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases tolerance; however, it has been associated with reports of neck aches, possibly caused by incorrect headrest usage. Subsequent U.S. fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20°. Because of the seat angle and the canopy&#x27;s thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire canopy is jettisoned prior to the seat&#x27;s rocket firing.
The pilot flies primarily by means of an armrest-mounted side-stick controller (instead of a traditional center-mounted stick) and an engine throttle; conventional rudder pedals are also employed. To enhance the pilot&#x27;s degree of control of the aircraft during combat maneuvers, various switches and function controls were moved to centralized hands on throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls upon both the controllers and the throttle. Hand pressure on the side-stick controller is transmitted by electrical signals via the FBW system to adjust various flight control surfaces to maneuver the F-16. Originally, the side-stick controller was non-moving, but this proved uncomfortable and difficult for pilots to adjust to, sometimes resulting in a tendency to &quot;over-rotate&quot; during takeoffs, so the control stick was given a small amount of &quot;play&quot;. Since the introduction of the F-16, HOTAS controls have become a standard feature on modern fighters.
The F-16 has a head-up display (HUD), which projects visual flight and combat information in front of the pilot without obstructing the view; being able to keep their head &quot;out of the cockpit&quot; improves the pilot&#x27;s situation awareness. Further flight and systems information are displayed on multi-function displays (MFD). The left-hand MFD is the primary flight display (PFD), typically showing radar and moving maps; the right-hand MFD is the system display (SD), presenting information about the engine, landing gear, slat and flap settings, and fuel and weapons status. Initially, the F-16A/B had monochrome cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays; replaced by color liquid-crystal displays on the Block 50/52. The Mid-Life Update (MLU) introduced compatibility with night-vision goggles (NVG). The Boeing Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) is available from Block 40 onwards for targeting based on where the pilot&#x27;s head faces, unrestricted by the HUD, using high-off-boresight missiles like the AIM-9X.

In November 2024 it was announced that the US Air Force had awarded a $9 million contract to Danish defense company Terma A/S, to supply its 3-D audio system for the aircraft, with a program of upgrades over the following two years. The system will provide high-fidelity digital audio by spatially separating radio signals, aligning audio with threat directions, and integrating active noise reduction.

===Fire-control radar===
The F-16A/B was originally equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-66 fire-control radar. Its slotted planar array antenna was designed to be compact to fit into the F-16&#x27;s relatively small nose. In uplook mode, the APG-66 uses a low pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) for medium- and high-altitude target detection in a low-clutter environment, and in look-down/shoot-down employs a medium PRF for heavy clutter environments. It has four operating frequencies within the X band, and provides four air-to-air and seven air-to-ground operating modes for combat, even at night or in bad weather. The Block 15&#x27;s APG-66(V)2 model added more powerful signal processing, higher output power, improved reliability, and increased range in cluttered or jamming environments. The Mid-Life Update (MLU) program introduced a new model, APG-66(V)2A, which features higher speed and more memory.
The AN/APG-68, an evolution of the APG-66, was introduced with the F-16C/D Block 25. The APG-68 has greater range and resolution, as well as 25 operating modes, including ground-mapping, Doppler beam-sharpening, ground moving target indication, sea target, and track while scan (TWS) for up to 10 targets. The Block 40/42&#x27;s APG-68(V)1 model added full compatibility with Lockheed Martin Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) pods, and a high-PRF pulse-Doppler track mode to provide Interrupted Continuous Wave guidance for semi-active radar homing (SARH) missiles like the AIM-7 Sparrow. Block 50/52 F-16s initially used the more reliable APG-68(V)5 which has a programmable signal processor employing Very High Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) technology. The Advanced Block 50/52 (or 50+/52+) is equipped with the APG-68(V)9 radar, with a 30% greater air-to-air detection range and a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode for high-resolution mapping and target detection-recognition. In August 2004, Northrop Grumman was contracted to upgrade the APG-68 radars of Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft to the (V)10 standard, providing all-weather autonomous detection and targeting for Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided precision weapons, SAR mapping, and terrain-following radar (TF) modes, as well as interleaving of all modes.

The F-16E/F is outfitted with Northrop Grumman&#x27;s AN/APG-80 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. Northrop Grumman developed the latest AESA radar upgrade for the F-16 (selected for USAF and Taiwan&#x27;s Republic of China Air Force F-16 upgrades), named the AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR). In July 2007, Raytheon announced that it was developing a Next Generation Radar (RANGR) based on its earlier AN/APG-79 AESA radar as a competitor to Northrop Grumman&#x27;s AN/APG-68 and AN/APG-80 for the F-16. On 28 February 2020, Northrop Grumman received an order from USAF to extend the service lives of their F-16s to at least 2048 with AN/APG-83 as part of the service-life extension program (SLEP).

===Propulsion===
The initial powerplant selected for the single-engined F-16 was the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-200 afterburning turbofan, a modified version of the F-15&#x27;s F100-PW-100, rated at thrust. During testing, the engine was found to be prone to compressor stalls and &quot;rollbacks&quot;, wherein the engine&#x27;s thrust would spontaneously reduce to idle. Until resolved, the Air Force ordered F-16s to be operated within &quot;dead-stick landing&quot; distance of its bases. It was the standard F-16 engine through the Block 25, except for the newly built Block 15s with the Operational Capability Upgrade (OCU). The OCU introduced the F100-PW-220, later installed on Block 32 and 42 aircraft: the main advance being a Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC) unit, which improved reliability and reduced stall occurrence. Beginning production in 1988, the &quot;-220&quot; also supplanted the F-15&#x27;s &quot;-100&quot;, for commonality. Many of the &quot;-220&quot; engines on Block 25 and later aircraft were upgraded from 1997 onwards to the &quot;-220E&quot; standard, which enhanced reliability and maintainability; unscheduled engine removals were reduced by 35%.
The F100-PW-220/220E was the result of the USAF&#x27;s Alternate Fighter Engine (AFE) program (colloquially known as &quot;the Great Engine War&quot;), which also saw the entry of General Electric as an F-16 engine provider. Its F110-GE-100 turbofan was limited by the original inlet to a thrust of , the Modular Common Inlet Duct allowed the F110 to achieve its maximum thrust of . (To distinguish between aircraft equipped with these two engines and inlets, from the Block 30 series on, blocks ending in &quot;0&quot; (e.g., Block 30) are powered by GE, and blocks ending in &quot;2&quot; (e.g., Block 32) are fitted with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines.)

The Increased Performance Engine (IPE) program led to the F110-GE-129 on the Block 50 and F100-PW-229 on the Block 52. F-16s began flying with these IPE engines in the early 1990s. Altogether, of the 1,446 F-16C/Ds ordered by the USAF, 556 were fitted with F100-series engines and 890 with F110s. The United Arab Emirates&#x27; Block 60 is powered by the General Electric F110-GE-132 turbofan with a maximum thrust of , the highest thrust engine developed for the F-16.
==Operational history==
===United States===
The F-16 is being used by the active-duty USAF, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard units, the USAF aerial demonstration team, the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, and as an adversary-aggressor aircraft by the United States Navy at the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center.

The U.S. Air Force, including the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard, flew the F-16 in combat during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and in the Balkans later in the 1990s. F-16s also patrolled the no-fly zones in Iraq during Operations Northern Watch and Southern Watch and served during the War in Afghanistan and the War in Iraq from 2001 and 2003 respectively. In 2011, Air Force F-16s took part in the intervention in Libya.

On 11 September 2001, two unarmed F-16s were launched in an attempt to ram and down United Airlines Flight 93 before it reached Washington D.C. during the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, but Flight 93 was prematurely brought down by the hijackers after passengers attacked the cockpit, so the F-16s were retasked to patrol the local airspace and later escorted Air Force One back to Washington.

The F-16 had been scheduled to remain in service with the U.S. Air Force until 2025. Its replacement is planned to be the F-35A variant of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, which is expected to gradually begin replacing several multirole aircraft among the program&#x27;s member nations. However, owing to delays in the F-35 program, all USAF F-16s will receive service life extension upgrades. In 2022, it was announced the USAF would continue to operate the F-16 for another two decades.

===Israel===
The F-16&#x27;s first air-to-air combat success was achieved by the Israeli Air Force (IAF) over the Bekaa Valley on 28 April 1981, against a Syrian Mi-8 helicopter, which was downed with cannon fire. On 7 June 1981, eight Israeli F-16s, escorted by six F-15s, executed Operation Opera, their first employment in a significant air-to-ground operation. This raid severely damaged Osirak, an Iraqi nuclear reactor under construction near Baghdad, to prevent the regime of Saddam Hussein from using the reactor for the creation of nuclear weapons.

The following year, during the 1982 Lebanon War Israeli F-16s engaged Syrian aircraft in one of the largest air battles involving jet aircraft, which began on 9 June and continued for two more days. Israeli Air Force F-16s were credited with 44 air-to-air kills during the conflict.

In January 2000, Israel completed a purchase of 102 new F-16I aircraft in a deal totaling . F-16s were also used in their ground-attack role for strikes against targets in Lebanon. IAF F-16s participated in the 2006 Lebanon War and the 2008–09 Gaza War. During and after the 2006 Lebanon war, IAF F-16s shot down Iranian-made UAVs launched by Hezbollah, using Rafael Python 5 air-to-air missiles.

On 10 February 2018, an Israeli Air Force F-16I was shot down in northern Israel when it was hit by a relatively old model S-200 (NATO name SA-5 Gammon) surface-to-air missile of the Syrian Air Defense Force. The pilot and navigator ejected safely in Israeli territory. The F-16I was part of a bombing mission against Syrian and Iranian targets around Damascus after an Iranian drone entered Israeli airspace and was shot down. An Israel Air Force investigation determined on 27 February 2018 that the loss was due to pilot error since the IAF determined the air crew did not adequately defend themselves.

On 16 July 2024, the last single-seat F-16C Barak-1 (‘Lightning’ in Hebrew) were retired; the IAF continue to use the F-16D Brakeet and F-16I Sufa two-seat variants.

===Pakistan===
During the Soviet–Afghan War, PAF F-16As shot down between 20 and 30 Soviet and Afghan warplanes; the political situation however resulted in PAF officially recognizing only 9 kills which were made inside Pakistani airspace. From May 1986 to January 1989, PAF F-16s from the Tail Choppers and Griffin squadrons using mostly AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, shot down four Afghan Su-22s, two MiG-23s, one Su-25, and one An-26. Most of these kills were by missiles, but at least one, a Su-22, was destroyed by cannon fire. One F-16 was lost in these battles. The downed F-16 was likely hit accidentally by the other F-16.

On 7 June 2002, a Pakistan Air Force F-16B Block 15 (S. No. 82-605) shot down an Indian Air Force unmanned aerial vehicle, an Israeli-made Searcher II, using an AIM-9L Sidewinder missile, during a night interception near Lahore.

The Pakistan Air Force has used its F-16s in various foreign and internal military exercises, such as the &quot;Indus Vipers&quot; exercise in 2008 conducted jointly with Turkey.

Between May 2009 and , the PAF F-16 fleet flew more than 5,500 sorties in support of the Pakistan Army&#x27;s operations against the Taliban insurgency in the FATA region of North-West Pakistan. More than 80% of the dropped munitions were laser-guided bombs.

On 27 February 2019, following six Pakistan Air Force airstrikes in Jammu and Kashmir, India, Pakistani officials said that two of its fighter jets shot down one MiG-21 and one Su-30MKI belonging to the Indian Air Force. Indian officials only confirmed the loss of one MiG-21 but denied losing any Su-30MKI in the clash and claimed the Pakistani claims as dubious. Additionally Indian officials also claimed to have shot down one F-16 belonging to the Pakistan Air Force. This was denied by the Pakistani side, considered dubious by neutral sources, and later backed by a report by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine, reporting that the US had completed a physical count of Pakistan&#x27;s F-16s and found none missing. A report by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted that the Pentagon and State Department refused public comment on the matter but did not deny the earlier report.

===Turkey===
The Turkish Air Force acquired its first F-16s in 1987. F-16s were later produced in Turkey under four phases of &quot;Peace Onyx&quot; programs. In 2015, they were upgraded to Block 50/52+ with CCIP by Turkish Aerospace Industries. Turkish F-16s are being fitted with indigenous AESA radars and EW suite called SPEWS-II.

On 18 June 1992, a Greek Mirage F1 crashed during a dogfight with a Turkish F-16. On 8 February 1995, a Turkish F-16 crashed into the Aegean Sea after being intercepted by Greek Mirage F1 fighters.

Turkish F-16s have participated in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo since 1993 in support of United Nations resolutions.

On 8 October 1996, seven months after the escalation a Greek Mirage 2000 reportedly fired an R.550 Magic II missile and shot down a Turkish F-16D over the Aegean Sea. The Turkish pilot died, while the co-pilot ejected and was rescued by Greek forces. In August 2012, after the downing of an RF-4E on the Syrian coast, Turkish Defence Minister İsmet Yılmaz confirmed that the Turkish F-16D was shot down by a Greek Mirage 2000 with an R.550 Magic II in 1996 near Chios island. Greece denies that the F-16 was shot down. Both Mirage 2000 pilots reported that the F-16 caught fire and they saw one parachute.

On 23 May 2006, two Greek F-16s intercepted a Turkish RF-4 reconnaissance aircraft and two F-16 escorts off the coast of the Greek island of Karpathos, within the Athens FIR. A mock dogfight ensued between the two sides, resulting in a midair collision between a Turkish F-16 and a Greek F-16. The Turkish pilot ejected safely, but the Greek pilot died owing to damage caused by the collision.

Turkey used its F-16s extensively in its conflict with Kurdish insurgents in southeastern parts of Turkey and Iraq. Turkey launched its first cross-border raid on 16 December 2007, a prelude to the 2008 Turkish incursion into northern Iraq, involving 50 fighters before Operation Sun. This was the first time Turkey had mounted a night-bombing operation on a massive scale, and also the largest operation conducted by the Turkish Air Force.

During the Syrian Civil War, Turkish F-16s were tasked with airspace protection on the Syrian border. After the RF-4 downing in June 2012 Turkey changed its rules of engagement against Syrian aircraft, resulting in scrambles and downings of Syrian combat aircraft. On 16 September 2013, a Turkish Air Force F-16 shot down a Syrian Arab Air Force Mil Mi-17 helicopter near the Turkish border. On 23 March 2014, a Turkish Air Force F-16 shot down a Syrian Arab Air Force MiG-23 when it allegedly entered Turkish air space during a ground attack mission against Al Qaeda-linked insurgents. On 16 May 2015, two Turkish Air Force F-16s shot down a Syrian Mohajer 4 UAV firing two AIM-9 missiles after it trespassed into Turkish airspace for 5 minutes. A Turkish Air Force F-16 shot down a Russian Air Force Sukhoi Su-24 on the Turkey-Syria border on 24 November 2015.

On 1 March 2020, two Syrian Sukhoi Su-24s were shot down by Turkish Air Force F-16s using air-to-air missiles over Syria&#x27;s Idlib Governorate. All four pilots safely ejected. On 3 March 2020, a Syrian Arab Army Air Force L-39 combat trainer was shot down by a Turkish F-16 over Syria&#x27;s Idlib province. The pilot died.

As a part of Turkish F-16 modernization program new air-to-air missiles are being developed and tested for the aircraft. GÖKTUĞ program led by TUBITAK SAGE has presented two types of air-to-air missiles named as Bozdogan (Merlin) and Gokdogan (Peregrine). While Bozdogan has been categorized as a Within Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile (WVRAAM), Gokdogan is a Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile (BVRAAM). On 14 April 2021, first live test exercise of Bozdogan have successfully completed and the first batch of missiles are expected to be delivered throughout the same year to the Turkish Air Force.

===Egypt===
On 16 February 2015, Egyptian F-16s struck weapons caches and training camps of the Islamic State (ISIS) in Libya in retaliation for the murder of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christian construction workers by masked militants affiliated with ISIS. The airstrikes killed 64 ISIS fighters, including three leaders in Derna and Sirte on the coast.

===Europe===
The Royal Netherlands Air Force, Belgian Air Component, Royal Danish Air Force and Royal Norwegian Air Force all fly the F-16. All F-16s in most European air forces are equipped with drag chutes specifically to allow them to operate from automobile highways.

A Yugoslavian MiG-29 was shot down by a Dutch F-16AM during the Kosovo War in 1999. Belgian and Danish F-16s also participated in joint operations over Kosovo during the war. Dutch, Belgian, Danish, and Norwegian F-16s were deployed during the 2011 intervention in Libya and in Afghanistan. In Libya, Norwegian F-16s dropped almost 550 bombs and flew 596 missions, some 17% of the total strike missions including the bombing of Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s headquarters.

In late March 2018, Croatia announced its intention to purchase 12 used Israeli F-16C/D &quot;Barak&quot;/&quot;Brakeet&quot; jets, pending U.S. approval. Acquiring these F-16s would allow Croatia to retire its aging MiG-21s. In January 2019, the deal was canceled because U.S. would only allow the resale if Israel stripped the planes of all the modernized electronics, while Croatia insisted on the original deal with all the upgrades installed. At the end of November 2021, Croatia signed with France instead, for 12 Rafales.

On 11 July 2018, Slovakia&#x27;s government approved the purchase of 14 F-16 Block 70/72 to replace its aging fleet of Soviet-made MiG-29s. A contract was signed on 12 December 2018 in Bratislava.

===Ukraine===
In May 2023, an international coalition consisting of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark announced their intention to train Ukrainian Air Force pilots on the F-16 ahead of possible future deliveries to increase the Ukrainian Air Force capabilities in the current Russo-Ukrainian War. The U.S. confirmed that it would approve the re-export from these countries to Ukraine. Denmark has agreed to help train Ukrainians on their usage of the fighter. Denmark&#x27;s acting Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said that Denmark &quot;will now be able to move forward for a collective contribution to train Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s&quot;. On 6 July 2023, Romania announced that it will host the future training center after the meeting of the Supreme Council of National Defense. During the 2023 Vilnius summit, a coalition was formed consisting of Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine. A number of Ukrainian pilots began training in Denmark and the U.S. The European F-16 Training Center, organized by Romania, the Netherlands, and Lockheed Martin through several subcontractors, officially opened on 13 November 2023. It is located at the Romanian Air Force&#x27;s 86th Air Base, and Ukrainian pilots are expected to start training there in early 2024. On 17 August 2023, the U.S. approved the transfer of F-16s from the Netherlands and Denmark to Ukraine after the Ukrainian pilots have completed their training. The Netherlands and Denmark have announced that together they will donate up to 61 F-16AM/BM Block 15 MLU fighters to Ukraine once pilot training has been completed.

On 13 May 2024, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said that &quot;F-16 from Denmark will be in the air over Ukraine within months.&quot; Denmark is sending 19 F-16s in total. By the end of July 2024, the first F-16s were delivered to Ukraine.

On 4 August 2024, President Zelensky announced to the public that the F-16 was now in operational service with Ukraine. Zelensky stated at an opening ceremony that: &quot;F-16s are in Ukraine. We did it. I am proud of our guys who are mastering these jets and have already started using them for our country,&quot;.

On 26 August 2024, F-16s were reportedly used to intercept Russian cruise missiles for the first time. Also on 26 August, a Ukrainian F-16 crashed and the pilot, Oleksiy Mes, was killed while intercepting Russian aerial targets during the cruise missile strikes. The cause is under investigation.
On 30 August 2024, the Commander of the Ukrainian Air Force, Mykola Oleshchuk, was dismissed by President Zelenskyy and replaced by Lieutenant General Anatolii Kryvonozhko, which was partially attributed to &quot;indications&quot; that the F-16 that crashed on 26 August was shot down in &quot;a friendly fire incident&quot;. Ukrainian parliamentarian Maryana Bezuhla and Oleshchuk had previously argued over the cause of the F-16 loss.

On 13 December 2024, the Ukrainian Air Force claimed an F-16 shot down six Russian cruise missiles. Two were shot down with &quot;medium-range missiles&quot;, another two with &quot;short-range missiles&quot; and two were claimed to be downed by the 20 mm cannon.

===Others===

Venezuela Air Force have flown the F-16 on combat missions. During the November 1992 Venezuelan coup attempt, two F-16A belonging to the government loyalist managed to shoot down two OV-10 Bronco and an AT-27 Tucano flown by the rebels and establishing aerial superiority for the government forces.

Two F-16B of the Indonesian Air Force intercepted and engaged several US Navy F/A-18 Hornets over the Java Sea in the 2003 Bawean incident.

The Royal Moroccan Air Force and the Royal Bahraini Air Force each lost a single F-16C, both shot down by Houthi anti-aircraft fire during the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, respectively on 11 May 2015 and on 30 December 2015.

On 11 October 2023, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Regional Security Mira Resnick confirmed to Jorge Argüello, Argentinean ambassador to the US, that the State Department has approved the transfer of 38 F-16s from Denmark. On 16 April 2024, it was announced by defense minister Luis Petri that the country went through with the purchase of 24+1 Danish F-16s, that are to be brought up to date before they are sent to Argentina. The 25th plane, an F-16B MLU Block 10, meant for mechanics training, came disassembled in an Argentinian C-130 in late December 2024. Six F-16s a year are to be delivered from Denmark to Argentina until all are delivered, with the first batch expected around November 2025.

In 2019, the US State Department approved the possible sale of 8 F-16 Block 70s to Bulgaria, and the deal was approved by the Bulgarian parliament, and President Rumen Radev. In November 2022, the purchase of a further 8 F-16 Block 70 fighters, spares, weapons and other systems was approved for delivery in 2027. The Bulgarian Air Force expects delivery of the first eight new F-16 Block 70s by 2025 and the second batch of eight F-16 Block 70s is expected in 2027.

===Potential operators===

====Philippines====
On 24 June 2021, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency approved the Philippines&#x27; purchase of 12 F-16s worth an estimated US$2.43 billion. However, the Philippines has yet to complete this deal due to financial constraints with negotiations ongoing.

====Argentina====
On 18 December 2024, Argentina selected a bid for 24 F-16AM/BM aircraft from Denmark, instead of one from JF-17s from China/Pakistan.

===Civilian operators===

====Top Aces====
In January 2021, Canadian defence contractor Top Aces announced that they had taken delivery of the first civilian owned F-16s to their US HQ in Mesa, Arizona. In an approval process that had taken years, they had purchased a batch of 29 F-16A/B &quot;Netz&quot; from the Israeli Air Force, including several that had taken part in Operation Opera. A year later, the first of these aircraft had finished the extensive AAMS mission system upgrades including AESA radar, HMCS, ECM, and Tactical Datalink. In late 2022 they began regular operations flying as contracted aggressors for USAF F-22 and F-35 squadrons in Luke AFB and Eglin AFB, as well as supporting exercises in other USAF and USMC bases.

==Variants==

F-16 models are denoted by increasing block numbers to denote upgrades. The blocks cover both single- and two-seat versions. A variety of software, hardware, systems, weapons compatibility, and structural enhancements have been instituted over the years to gradually upgrade production models and retrofit delivered aircraft.

While many F-16s were produced according to these block designs, there have been many other variants with significant changes, usually because of modification programs. Other changes have resulted in role-specialization, such as the close air support and reconnaissance variants. Several models were also developed to test new technology. The F-16 design also inspired the design of other aircraft, which are considered derivatives. Older F-16s are being converted into QF-16 drone targets.

; : The F-16A (single seat) and F-16B (two seat) were initial production variants. These variants include the Block 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 versions. Block 15 was the first major change to the F-16 with larger horizontal stabilizers. It is the most numerous of all F-16 variants with 983 produced. Around 300 earlier USAF F-16A and B aircraft were upgraded to the Block 15 Mid-Life Update (MLU) standard, getting analogous capability to F-16C/D Block 50/52 aircraft. From 1987 a total of 214 Block 15 aircraft were upgraded to OCU (Operational Capability Upgrade) standard, with engines, structural and electronic improvements, and from 1988 all Block 15 were directly build to OCU specifications. Between 1989 and 1992 a total of 271 Block 15OCU airframes (246 F-16A and 25 F-16B) were converted at the Ogden Air Logistic Center to the ADF (Air Defense Fighter) variant, with improved IFF system, radio and radar, the ability to carry advanced Beyond Visual Range missiles and the addition of a side-mounted 150,000 candlepower spotlight for visual night identification of intruders. Originally intended for Cold-War air defense of the continental U.S. airspace, with the fall of the Berlin Wall the ADF lost a clear mission, and most were mothballed starting from 1994. Some mothballed ADFs were later exported to Jordan (12 -A and 4 -B models) and Thailand (15 -A and 1 -B), while 30 -A and 4 -B models were leased to Italy from 2003 to 2012
; F-16C/D: The F-16C (single seat) and F-16D (two seat) variants entered production in 1984. The first C/D version was the Block 25 with improved cockpit avionics and radar which added all-weather capability with beyond-visual-range (BVR) AIM-7 and AIM-120 air-air missiles. Block 30/32, 40/42, and 50/52 were later C/D versions. The F-16C/D had a unit cost of US$18.8 million (1998). Operational cost per flight hour has been estimated at $7,000 to $22,470 or $24,000, depending on the calculation method.
; F-16E/F: The F-16E (single seat) and F-16F (two seat) are newer F-16 Block 60 variants based on the F-16C/D Block 50/52. The United Arab Emirates invested heavily in their development. They feature improved AN/APG-80 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, infrared search and track (IRST), avionics, conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), and the more powerful General Electric F110-GE-132 engine.

; F-16IN: For the Indian MRCA competition for the Indian Air Force, Lockheed Martin offered the &quot;F-16IN Super Viper&quot;. The F-16IN is based on the F-16E/F Block 60 and features conformal fuel tanks; AN/APG-80 AESA radar, GE F110-GE-132A engine with FADEC controls; electronic warfare suite and infrared search and track (IRST) unit; updated glass cockpit; and a helmet-mounted cueing system. As of 2011, the F-16IN is no longer in the competition. In 2016, Lockheed Martin offered the new F-16 Block 70/72 version to India under the Make in India program.&lt;ref name=&quot;block70/72&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Indian government offered to purchase 200 (potentially up to 300) fighters in a deal worth $13–15bn. As of 2017, Lockheed Martin has agreed to manufacture F-16 Block 70 fighters in India with the Indian defense firm Tata Advanced Systems Limited. The new production line could be used to build F-16s for India and for exports.

; F-16IQ: In September 2010, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency informed the United States Congress of a possible Foreign Military Sale of 18 F-16IQ aircraft along with the associated equipment and services to the newly reformed Iraqi Air Force. The total value of sale was estimated at . The Iraqi Air Force purchased those 18 jets in the second half of 2011, then later exercised an option to purchase 18 more for a total of 36 F-16IQs. , the Iraqi had lost two in accidents. By 2023, the US government reported that these jets were Iraq&#x27;s most capable airborne platforms with a 66 percent mission-capable rate. Their maintenance was being supported by private contractors. At the same time, Iraq&#x27;s Russian-made systems were suffering from sanctions imposed in the wake of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

; F-16N: The F-16N was an adversary aircraft operated by the United States Navy. It is based on the standard F-16C/D Block 30, is powered by the General Electric F110-GE-100 engine, and is capable of supercruise. The F-16N has a strengthened wing and is capable of carrying an Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pod on the starboard wingtip. Although the single-seat F-16Ns and twin-seat (T)F-16Ns are based on the early-production small-inlet Block 30 F-16C/D airframe, they retain the APG-66 radar of the F-16A/B. In addition, the aircraft&#x27;s cannon has been removed, as has the airborne self-protection jammer (ASPJ), and they carry no missiles. Their EW fit consists of an ALR-69 radar warning receiver (RWR) and an ALE-40 chaff/flare dispenser. The F-16Ns and (T)F-16Ns have the standard Air Force tailhook and undercarriage and are not aircraft carrier–capable. Production totaled 26 airframes, of which 22 are single-seat F-16Ns and 4 are twin-seat TF-16Ns. The initial batch of aircraft was in service between 1988 and 1998. At that time, hairline cracks were discovered in several bulkheads, and the Navy did not have the resources to replace them, so the aircraft were eventually retired, with one aircraft sent to the collection of the National Naval Aviation Museum at NAS Pensacola, Florida, and the remainder placed in storage at Davis-Monthan AFB. These aircraft were later replaced by embargoed ex-Pakistani F-16s in 2003. The original inventory of F-16Ns was previously operated by adversary squadrons at NAS Oceana, Virginia; NAS Key West, Florida; and the former NAS Miramar, California. The current F-16A/B aircraft are operated by the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center at NAS Fallon, Nevada.

; F-16V: At the 2012 Singapore Air Show, Lockheed Martin unveiled plans for the new F-16V variant with the V suffix for its Viper nickname. It features an AN/APG-83 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, a new mission computer and electronic warfare suite, an automated ground collision avoidance system, and various cockpit improvements; this package is an option on current production F-16s and can be retrofitted to most in service F-16s. First flight took place 21 October 2015. Taiwanese media reported that Taiwan and the U.S. both initially invested in the development of the F-16V. Upgrades to Taiwan&#x27;s F-16 fleet began in January 2017. The first country to confirm the purchase of 16 new F-16 Block 70/72 was Bahrain. Greece announced the upgrade of 84 F-16C/D Block 52+ and Block 52+ Advanced (Block 52M) to the latest V (Block 70/72) variant in October 2017. Slovakia announced on 11 July 2018 that it intends to purchase 14 F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft. Lockheed Martin has redesignated the F-16V Block 70 as the &quot;F-21&quot; in its offering for India&#x27;s fighter requirement. Taiwan&#x27;s Republic of China Air Force announced on 19 March 2019 that it formally requested the purchase of an additional 66 F-16V fighters. The Trump administration approved the sale on 20 August 2019. On 14 August 2020, Lockheed Martin was awarded a US$62 billion contract by the US DoD that includes 66 new F-16s at US$8 billion (~$ in ) for Taiwan.
; QF-16: In September 2013, Boeing and the U.S. Air Force tested an unmanned F-16, with two US Air Force pilots controlling the airplane from the ground as it flew from Tyndall AFB over the Gulf of Mexico.

==Notable accidents and incidents==


The F-16 has been involved in over 670 hull-loss accidents as of January 2020.
*On 8 May 1975, while practicing a 9-&quot;g&quot; aerial display maneuver with the second YF-16 (tail number &quot;72-1568&quot;) at Fort Worth, Texas, prior to being sent to the Paris Air Show, one of the main landing gears jammed. The test pilot, Neil Anderson, had to perform an emergency gear-up landing and chose to do so in the grass, hoping to minimize damage and avoid injuring any observers. The aircraft was only slightly damaged, but because of the mishap, the first prototype was sent to the Paris Air Show in its place.
*On 15 November 1982, while on a training flight outside Kunsan Air Base in South Korea, USAF Captain Ted Harduvel died when he crashed inverted into a mountain ridge. In 1985, Harduvel&#x27;s widow filed a lawsuit against General Dynamics claiming an electrical malfunction, not pilot error, as the cause; a jury awarded the plaintiff in damages. However, in 1989, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled the contractor had immunity to lawsuits, overturning the previous judgment. The court remanded the case to the trial court &quot;for entry of judgment in favor of General Dynamics&quot;. The accident and subsequent trial was the subject of the 1992 film &quot;Afterburn&quot;.
*On 23 March 1994, during a joint Army-Air Force exercise at Pope AFB, North Carolina, F-16D (AF Serial No. 88-0171) of the 23d Fighter Wing / 74th Fighter Squadron was simulating an engine-out approach when it collided with a USAF C-130E. Both F-16 crew members ejected, but their aircraft, on full afterburner, continued on an arc towards Green Ramp and struck a USAF C-141 that was being boarded by US Army paratroopers. This accident resulted in 24 fatalities and at least 100 others injured. It has since been known as the &quot;Green Ramp disaster&quot;.
*On 15 September 2003, a USAF Thunderbirds F-16C crashed during an air show at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. Captain Christopher Stricklin attempted a &quot;split S&quot; maneuver based on an incorrect mean-sea-level altitude of the airfield. Climbing to only above ground level instead of , Stricklin had insufficient altitude to complete the maneuver, but was able to guide the aircraft away from spectators and ejected less than one second before impact. Stricklin survived with only minor injuries; the aircraft was destroyed. USAF procedure for demonstration &quot;Split-S&quot; maneuvers was changed, requiring both pilots and controllers to use above-ground-level (AGL) altitudes.
*On 26 January 2015, a Greek F-16D crashed while performing a NATO training exercise in Albacete, Spain. Both crew members and nine French soldiers on the ground died when it crashed in the flight line, destroying or damaging two Italian AMXs, two French Alpha jets, and one French Mirage 2000. Investigations suggested that the accident was due to an erroneous rudder setting that was caused by loose papers in the cockpit.
*On 7 July 2015, an F-16CJ collided with a Cessna 150M over Moncks Corner, South Carolina, U.S. The pilot of the F-16 ejected safely, but both people in the Cessna were killed.
* On 11 October 2018, an F-16 MLU from the 2nd Tactical Wing of the Belgian Air Component, on the apron at Florennes Air Station, was hit by a gun burst from a nearby F-16, whose cannon was fired inadvertently during maintenance. The aircraft caught fire and was burned to the ground, while two other F-16s were damaged and two maintenance personnel were treated for aural trauma.
* On 11 March 2020, a Pakistani F-16AM (Serial No. 92730) of the No. 9 Squadron (Pakistan Air Force) crashed in the Shakarparian area of Islamabad during rehearsals for the Pakistan Day Parade. The plane crashed when the F-16 was executing an aerobatic loop. As a result, the pilot of the F-16, Wing Commander Noman Akram, who was also the Commanding Officer of the No. 9 Squadron &quot;Griffins&quot;, lost his life. A board of inquiry ordered by the Pakistan Air Force later revealed that the pilot had every chance to eject but opted not to and tried his best to save the aircraft and avoid civilian casualties on the ground. Videos taken by locals on the ground show his F-16AM crashing into some woods. He was hailed a hero by Pakistanis while also gaining some attention internationally.
* On 6 May 2023, a U.S. Air Force F-16C of the 8th Fighter Wing crashed in a field near Osan Air Base in South Korea during a daytime training sortie. The pilot safely ejected from the aircraft.
*On 8 May 2024, an F-16C of the Republic of Singapore Air Force crashed during takeoff within Tengah Air Base. The pilot successfully ejected from the aircraft without major injuries. The cause was later identified to be from the malfunction of two of the three primary pitch rate gyroscopes on the aircraft. This was noted to be a &quot;rare occurrence&quot; by Lockheed Martin due to the concurrent failure of the two independent pitch rate gyroscopes giving similar inputs which caused the digital flight control computer to reject inputs from the correctly functioning pitch rate gyroscope and the backup pitch rate gyroscope when it was activated by the rejection of a primary pitch rate gyroscope.
==Aircraft on display==
As newer variants have entered service, many examples of older F-16 models have been preserved for display worldwide, particularly in Europe and the United States.

<text>The First Council of Constantinople (; ) was a council of Christian bishops convened in Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey) in AD 381 by the Roman Emperor Theodosius I. This second ecumenical council, an effort to attain consensus in the church through an assembly representing all of Christendom, except for the Western Church, confirmed the Nicene Creed, expanding the doctrine thereof to produce the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, and dealt with sundry other matters. It met from May to July 381 in the Church of Hagia Irene and was affirmed as ecumenical in 451 at the Council of Chalcedon.

==Background==
When Theodosius ascended to the imperial throne in 380, he began on a campaign to bring the Eastern Church back to Nicene Christianity. Theodosius wanted to further unify the entire empire behind the orthodox position and decided to convene a church council to resolve matters of faith and discipline. Gregory Nazianzus was of similar mind, wishing to unify Christianity. In the spring of 381 they convened the second ecumenical council in Constantinople.

===Theological context===
The Council of Nicaea in 325 had not ended the Arian controversy which it had been called to clarify. Arius and his sympathizers, e.g. Eusebius of Nicomedia, were admitted back into the church after ostensibly accepting the Nicene creed. Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, the most vocal opponent of Arianism, was ultimately exiled through the machinations of Eusebius of Nicomedia. After the death of Constantine I in 337 and the accession of his Arian-leaning son Constantius II, open discussion of replacing the Nicene creed itself began. Up until about 360, theological debates mainly dealt with the divinity of the Son, the second person of the Trinity. However, because the Council of Nicaea had not clarified the divinity of the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, it became a topic of debate. The Macedonians denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit. This was also known as Pneumatomachianism.

Nicene Christianity also had its defenders: apart from Athanasius, the Cappadocian Fathers&#x27; Trinitarian discourse was influential in the council at Constantinople. Apollinaris of Laodicea, another pro-Nicene theologian, proved controversial. Possibly in an over-reaction to Arianism and its teaching that Christ was not God, he taught that Christ consisted of a human body and a divine mind, rejecting the belief that Christ had a complete human nature, including a human mind. He was charged with confounding the persons of the Godhead, and with giving in to the heretical ways of Sabellius. Basil of Caesarea accused him of abandoning the literal sense of the scripture, and taking up wholly with the allegorical sense. His views were condemned in a Synod at Alexandria, under Athanasius of Alexandria, in 362, and later subdivided into several different heresies, the main ones of which were the Polemians and the Antidicomarianites.

===Geopolitical context===
Theodosius&#x27; strong commitment to Nicene Christianity involved a calculated risk because Constantinople, the imperial capital of the Eastern Empire, was solidly Arian. To complicate matters, the two leading factions of Nicene Christianity in the East, the Alexandrians and the supporters of Meletius in Antioch, were &quot;bitterly divided ... almost to the point of complete animosity&quot;.

The bishops of Alexandria and Rome had worked over a number of years to keep the see of Constantinople from stabilizing. Thus, when Gregory was selected as a candidate for the bishopric of Constantinople, both Alexandria and Rome opposed him because of his Antiochene background.

===Meletian schism===
===See of Constantinople===
The incumbent bishop of Constantinople was Demophilus, a Homoian Arian. On his accession to the imperial throne, Theodosius offered to confirm Demophilus as bishop of the imperial city on the condition of accepting the Nicene Creed; however, Demophilus refused to abandon his Arian beliefs, and was immediately ordered to give up his churches and leave Constantinople. After forty years under the control of Arian bishops, the churches of Constantinople were now restored to those who subscribed to the Nicene Creed; Arians were also ejected from the churches of other cities in the Eastern Roman Empire thus re-establishing Christian orthodoxy in the East.

There ensued a contest to control the newly recovered see. A group led by Maximus the Cynic gained the support of Patriarch Peter of Alexandria by playing on his jealousy of the newly created see of Constantinople. They conceived a plan to install a cleric subservient to Peter as bishop of Constantinople so that Alexandria would retain the leadership of the Eastern Churches. Many commentators characterize Maximus as having been proud, arrogant and ambitious. However, it is not clear the extent to which Maximus sought this position due to his own ambition or if he was merely a pawn in the power struggle. In any event, the plot was set into motion when, on a night when Gregory was confined by illness, the conspirators burst into the cathedral and commenced the consecration of Maximus as bishop of Constantinople. They had seated Maximus on the archiepiscopal throne and had just begun shearing away his long curls when the day dawned. The news of what was transpiring quickly spread and everybody rushed to the church. The magistrates appeared with their officers; Maximus and his consecrators were driven from the cathedral, and ultimately completed the tonsure in the tenement of a flute-player.

The news of the brazen attempt to usurp the episcopal throne aroused the anger of the local populace among whom Gregory was popular. Maximus withdrew to Thessalonica to lay his cause before the emperor but met with a cold reception there. Theodosius committed the matter to Ascholius, the much respected bishop of Thessalonica, charging him to seek the counsel of Pope Damasus I.

Damasus&#x27; response repudiated Maximus summarily and advised Theodosius to summon a council of bishops for the purpose of settling various church issues such as the schism in Antioch and the consecration of a proper bishop for the see of Constantinople. Damasus condemned the translation of bishops from one see to another and urged Theodosius to &quot;take care that a bishop who is above reproach is chosen for that see.&quot;

==Proceedings==
Thirty-six Pneumatomachians arrived but were denied admission to the council when they refused to accept the Nicene creed.

Since Peter, the Pope of Alexandria, was not present, the presidency over the council was given to Meletius as Patriarch of Antioch. The first order of business before the council was to declare the clandestine consecration of Maximus invalid, and to confirm Theodosius&#x27; installation of Gregory Nazianzus as Archbishop of Constantinople. When Meletius died shortly after the opening of the council, Gregory was selected to lead the council.

The Egyptian and Macedonian bishops who had supported Maximus&#x27;s ordination arrived late for the council. Once there, they refused to recognise Gregory&#x27;s position as head of the church of Constantinople, arguing that his transfer from the See of Sasima was canonically illegitimate because one of the canons of the Council of Nicaea had forbidden bishops to transfer from their sees.

McGuckin describes Gregory as physically exhausted and worried that he was losing the confidence of the bishops and the emperor. Ayres goes further and asserts that Gregory quickly made himself unpopular among the bishops by supporting the losing candidate for the bishopric of Antioch and vehemently opposing any compromise with the Homoiousians.

Rather than press his case and risk further division, Gregory decided to resign his office: &quot;Let me be as the Prophet Jonah! I was responsible for the storm, but I would sacrifice myself for the salvation of the ship. Seize me and throw me... I was not happy when I ascended the throne, and gladly would I descend it.&quot; He shocked the council with his surprise resignation and then delivered a dramatic speech to Theodosius asking to be released from his offices. The emperor, moved by his words, applauded, commended his labor, and granted his resignation. The council asked him to appear once more for a farewell ritual and celebratory orations. Gregory used this occasion to deliver a final address (Or. 42) and then departed.

Nectarius, an unbaptized civil official, was chosen to succeed Gregory as president of the council.

==Canons==
Seven canons, four of these doctrinal canons and three disciplinary canons, are attributed to the council and accepted by both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Oriental Orthodox Churches; the Roman Catholic Church accepts only the first four because only the first four appear in the oldest copies and there is evidence that the last three were later additions.

* The first canon is an important dogmatic condemnation of all shades of Arianism, and also of Macedonianism and Apollinarianism.
* The second canon renewed the Nicene legislation imposing upon the bishops the observance of diocesan and patriarchal limits.
* The third canon reads:
* The fourth canon decreed the consecration of Maximus as Bishop of Constantinople to be invalid, declaring &quot;that [Maximus] neither was nor is a bishop, nor are they who have been ordained by him in any rank of the clergy&quot;. This canon was directed not only against Maximus, but also against the Egyptian bishops who had conspired to consecrate him clandestinely at Constantinople, and against any subordinate ecclesiastics that he might have ordained in Egypt.
* The fifth canon might actually have been passed the next year, 382, and is in regard to a &quot;Tome&quot; of the Western bishops, perhaps that of Pope Damasus I.
* The sixth canon might belong to the year 382 as well and was subsequently passed at the Quinisext Council as canon 95. It limits the ability to accuse bishops of wrongdoing.
* The seventh canon regards procedures for receiving certain heretics into the church.

==Dispute concerning the third canon==
The third canon was a first step in the rising importance of the new imperial capital, just fifty years old, and was notable in that it demoted the patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria. Jerusalem, as the site of the first church, retained its place of honor. It originally did not elicit controversy, as the Papal legate Paschasinus and a partisan of his, Diogenes of Cyzicus, reference the canon as being in force during the first session of the Council of Chalcedon. According to Eusebius of Dorlyeum, another Papal ally during Chalcedon, &quot;I myself read this very canon [Canon 3] to the most holy pope in Rome in the presence of the clerics of Constantinople and he accepted it.&quot;

Nevertheless, controversy has ensued since then. The status of the canon became questioned after disputes over Canon 28 of the Council of Chalcedon erupted. Pope Leo the Great, declared that this canon had never been submitted to Rome and that their lessened honor was a violation of the Nicene council order. Throughout the next several centuries, the Western Church asserted that the Bishop of Rome had supreme authority, and by the time of the Great Schism the Roman Catholic Church based its claim to supremacy on the succession of St. Peter. At the Fourth Council of Constantinople (869), the Roman legates asserted the place of the bishop of Rome&#x27;s honor over the bishop of Constantinople&#x27;s.
After the Great Schism of 1054, in 1215 the Fourth Lateran Council declared, in its fifth canon, that the Roman Church &quot;by the will of God holds over all others pre-eminence of ordinary power as the mother and mistress of all the faithful&quot;. Roman supremacy over the whole world was formally claimed by the new Latin patriarch. The Roman correctores of Gratian, insert the words: &quot;canon hic ex iis est quos apostolica Romana sedes a principio et longo post tempore non recipit&quot; (&quot;this canon is one of those that the Apostolic See of Rome has not accepted from the beginning and ever since&quot;).

Later on, Baronius asserted that the third canon was not authentic, not in fact decreed by the council. Contrarily, roughly contemporaneous Greeks maintained that it did not declare supremacy of the Bishop of Rome, but the primacy; &quot;the first among equals&quot;, similar to how they today view the Bishop of Constantinople.

==Aftermath==
It has been asserted by many that a synod was held by Pope Damasus I in the following year (382) which opposed the disciplinary canons of the Council of Constantinople, especially the third canon which placed Constantinople above Alexandria and Antioch. The synod protested against this raising of the bishop of the new imperial capital, just fifty years old, to a status higher than that of the bishops of Alexandria and Antioch, and stated that the primacy of the Roman see had not been established by a gathering of bishops but rather by Christ himself. Thomas Shahan says that, according to Photius too, Pope Damasus approved the council, but he adds that, if any part of the council were approved by this pope, it could have been only its revision of the Nicene Creed, as was the case also when Gregory the Great recognized it as one of the four general councils, but only in its dogmatic utterances.

===Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed===

Traditionally, the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed has been associated with the Council of Constantinople (381). It is roughly theologically equivalent to the Nicene Creed, but includes two additional articles: an article on the Holy Spirit—describing Him as &quot;the Lord, the Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified, and Who spoke through the prophets&quot;—and an article about the church, baptism, and the resurrection of the dead. (For the full text of both creeds, see Comparison between Creed of 325 and Creed of 381.)

However, scholars are not agreed on the connection between the Council of Constantinople and the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. Some modern scholars believe that this creed, or something close to it, was stated by the bishops at Constantinople, but not promulgated as an official act of the council. Scholars also dispute whether this creed was simply an expansion of the Creed of Nicaea, or whether it was an expansion of another traditional creed similar but not identical to the one from Nicaea. In 451, the Council of Chalcedon referred to this creed as &quot;the creed ... of the 150 saintly fathers assembled in Constantinople&quot;, indicating that this creed was associated with Constantinople (381) no later than 451.

===Christology===
This council condemned Arianism which began to die out with further condemnations at a council of Aquileia by Ambrose of Milan in 381. With the discussion of Trinitarian doctrine now developed, the focus of discussion changed to Christology, which would be the topic of the Council of Ephesus of 431 and the Council of Chalcedon of 451.

===Shift of influence from Rome to Constantinople===
David Eastman cites the First Council of Constantinople as another example of the waning influence of Rome over the East. He notes that all three of the presiding bishops came from the East. Damasus had considered both Meletius and Gregory to be illegitimate bishops of their respective sees and yet, as Eastman and others point out, the Eastern bishops paid no heed to his opinions in this regard.

The First Council of Constantinople (381) was the first appearance of the term &#x27;New Rome&#x27; in connection to Constantinople. The term was employed as the grounds for giving the relatively young church of Constantinople precedence over Alexandria and Antioch (&#x27;because it is the New Rome&#x27;).

==Liturgical commemorations==
The 150 individuals at the council are commemorated in the Calendar of saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on February 17.

The Eastern Orthodox Church in some places (e.g. Russia) has a feast day for the Fathers of the First Six Ecumenical Councils on the Sunday nearest to July 13 and on May 22.

<text>The Fourth Council of Constantinople was held in 879–880. It confirmed the reinstatement of Photius I as patriarch of Constantinople.

The result of this council is accepted by the Eastern Orthodox as having the authority of an ecumenical council. Eastern Orthodox sometimes call it the eighth ecumenical council.

==Background==

The Council settled the dispute that had broken out after the deposition of Ignatius as Patriarch of Constantinople in 858. Ignatius, himself appointed to his office in an uncanonical manner, opposed Caesar Bardas, who had deposed the regent Theodora. In response, Bardas&#x27; nephew, the youthful Emperor Michael III engineered Ignatius&#x27;s deposition and confinement on the charge of treason. The patriarchal throne was filled with Photius, a renowned scholar and kinsman of Bardas. The deposition of Ignatius without a formal ecclesiastical trial and the sudden promotion of Photius caused scandal in the church. Pope Nicholas I and the western bishops took up the cause of Ignatius and condemned Photius&#x27; election as uncanonical. In 863, at a synod in Rome the pope deposed Photius, and reappointed Ignatius as the rightful patriarch. However, Photius enjoined the support of the Emperor and responded by calling a Council and excommunicating the pope.

This state of affairs changed when Photius&#x27;s patrons, Bardas and Emperor Michael III, were murdered in 866 and 867, respectively, by Basil the Macedonian, who now usurped the throne. Photius was deposed as patriarch, not so much because he was a protégé of Bardas and Michael, but because Basil was seeking an alliance with the Pope and the western emperor. Photius was removed from his office and banished about the end of September 867, and Ignatius was reinstated on 23 November. Photius was condemned by a Council held at Constantinople from 5 October 869 to 28 February 870. Photius was deposed and barred from the patriarchal office, while Ignatius was reinstated.

==Council of 879–880==

After the death of Ignatius in 877, the Emperor made Photius again Patriarch of Constantinople. A council was convened in 879, held at Constantinople, comprising the representatives of all the five patriarchates, including that of Rome (all in all 383 bishops). Anthony Edward Siecienski writes: &quot;In 879 the emperor called for another council to meet in Constantinople in the hopes that the new pope, John VIII (872-882) would recognize the validity of Photius&#x27;s claim upon the patriarchate. This council, sometimes called the eighth ecumenical in the East was attended by the papal legates (who had brought with them a gift from the pope—a pallium for Photius) and by over 400 bishops, and who immediately confirmed Photius as rightful patriarch.&quot;

The council also implicitly condemned the addition of the Filioque to the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, an addition rejected at that time in Rome: &quot;The Creed (without the &quot;filioque&quot;) was read out and a condemnation pronounced against those who &#x27;impose on it their own invented phrases [ἰδίας εὑρεσιολογίαις] and put this forth as a common lesson to the faithful or to those who return from some kind of heresy and display the audacity to falsify completely [κατακιβδηλεῦσαι άποθρασυνθείη] the antiquity of this sacred and venerable &quot;Horos&quot; [Rule] with illegitimate words, or additions, or subtractions&#x27;.&quot; Eastern Orthodox Christians argue that thereby the council condemned not only the addition of the Filioque clause to the creed but also denounced the clause as heretical (a view strongly espoused by Photius in his polemics against Rome), while Roman Catholics separate the two and insist on the theological orthodoxy of the clause. According to non-Catholic Philip Schaff, &quot;To the Greek acts was afterwards added a (pretended) letter of Pope John VIII to Photius, declaring the Filioque to be an addition which is rejected by the church of Rome, and a blasphemy which must be abolished calmly and by degrees.&quot;

==Confirmation and further reception==

The council was held in the presence of papal legates, who approved of the proceedings.

Roman Catholic historian Francis Dvornik argues that the pope accepted the acts of the council and annulled those of the Council of 869–870. Other Catholic historians, such as Warren Carroll, dispute this view, arguing that the pope rejected the council. Siecienski says that the Pope gave only a qualified assent to the acts of the council. Philip Schaff opines that the pope, deceived by his legates about the actual proceedings, first applauded the emperor but later denounced the council. In any case, the Pope had already accepted the reinstatement of Photius as Patriarch.

On 8 March 870, three days after the end of the council, the papal and Eastern delegates met with the Bulgarian ambassadors led by the kavhan Peter to decide the status of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. Since the Bulgarians were not satisfied with the positions of the Pope after prolonged negotiations, they reached favorable agreement with the Byzantines and the decision was taken that the Bulgarian Church should become Eastern Christian.

The Photian Schism (863–867) that led to the councils of 869 and 879 represents a break between East and West. While the previous seven ecumenical councils are recognized as ecumenical and authoritative by both East and West, many Eastern Orthodox Christians recognize the council of 879 as the Eighth Ecumenical Council, arguing that it annulled the earlier one. This council is referred to as Ecumenical in the Encyclical of the Eastern Patriarchs of 1848. The Catholic Church, however, recognizes the council of 869 as the eighth ecumenical council and does not place the council of 879 among its ecumenical councils.

<doc id="11646" wikidata="Q1325" url="?curid=11646" title="Friedrich Hayek">
<text>Friedrich August von Hayek ( ; ; 8 May 1899 – 23 March 1992), often referred to by his initials F. A. Hayek, was an Austrian-born British academic who contributed to political economy, political philosophy and intellectual history. Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Gunnar Myrdal for work on money and economic fluctuations, and the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena. His account of how prices communicate information is widely regarded as an important contribution to economics that led to him receiving the prize. He was a major contributor to the Austrian school of economics.

During his teenage years, Hayek fought in World War I. He later said this experience, coupled with his desire to help avoid the mistakes that led to the war, drew him into economics. He earned doctoral degrees in law in 1921 and political studies in 1923 from the University of Vienna. He subsequently lived and worked in Austria, Great Britain, the United States and Germany. He became a British national in 1938. He studied and taught at the London School of Economics and later at the University of Chicago, before returning to Europe late in life to teach at the Universities of Salzburg and Freiburg.

Hayek had considerable influence on a variety of political and economic movements of the 20th century, and his ideas continue to influence thinkers from a variety of political and economic backgrounds today. Although sometimes described as a conservative, Hayek himself was uncomfortable with this label and preferred to be thought of as a classical liberal or libertarian. His most popular work, &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;, has been republished many times over the eight decades since its original publication.

Hayek was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1984 for his academic contributions to economics. He was the first recipient of the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize in 1984. He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 from President George H. W. Bush. In 2011, his article &quot;The Use of Knowledge in Society&quot; was selected as one of the top 20 articles published in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot; during its first 100 years.

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Friedrich August von Hayek was born in Vienna to August von Hayek and Felicitas Hayek (&quot;née&quot; von Juraschek). The surname Hayek is derived from the Czech surname Hájek and can be traced to an ancestor with the surname &quot;Hagek&quot; who migrated from Prague in the 1500s.

His father, born in 1871, also in Vienna, was a medical doctor employed by the municipal ministry of health. August was a part-time botany lecturer at the University of Vienna. Friedrich was the oldest of three brothers, Heinrich (1900–1969) and Erich (1904–1986), who were one-and-a-half and five years younger than he was.

His father&#x27;s career as a university professor influenced Hayek&#x27;s goals later in life. Both of his grandfathers, who lived long enough for Hayek to know them, were scholars. Franz von Juraschek was a leading economist in Austria-Hungary and a close friend of Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, one of the founders of the Austrian School of Economics. Hayek&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Gustav Edler von Hayek, taught natural sciences at the Imperial &quot;Realobergymnasium&quot; (secondary school) in Vienna. He wrote works in the field of biological systematics, some of which are relatively well known.

On his mother&#x27;s side, Hayek was second cousin to the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. His mother often played with Wittgenstein&#x27;s sisters and had known him well. As a result of their family relationship, Hayek became one of the first to read Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot; when the book was published in its original German edition in 1921. Although he met Wittgenstein on only a few occasions, Hayek said that Wittgenstein&#x27;s philosophy and methods of analysis had a profound influence on his own life and thought. In his later years, Hayek recalled a discussion of philosophy with Wittgenstein when both were officers during World War I. After Wittgenstein&#x27;s death, Hayek had intended to write a biography of Wittgenstein and worked on collecting family materials and later assisted biographers of Wittgenstein. He was related to Wittgenstein on the non-Jewish side of the Wittgenstein family. Since his youth, Hayek frequently socialized with Jewish intellectuals, and he mentions that people often speculated whether he was also of Jewish ancestry. That made him curious, so he spent some time researching his ancestors and found out that he had no Jewish ancestors within five generations.

Hayek displayed an intellectual and academic bent from a very young age and read fluently and frequently before going to school. However, he did quite poorly at school, due to the lack of interest and problems with teachers. He was at the bottom of his class in most subjects and once received three failing grades, in Latin, Greek, and mathematics. He was very interested in theater, even attempting to write some tragedies, and biology, regularly helping his father with his botanical work. At his father&#x27;s suggestion, as a teenager he read the genetic and evolutionary works of Hugo de Vries and August Weismann and the philosophical works of Ludwig Feuerbach. He noted Goethe as the greatest early intellectual influence. In school, Hayek was much taken by one instructor&#x27;s lectures on Aristotle&#x27;s ethics. In his unpublished autobiographical notes, Hayek recalled a division between him and his younger brothers who were only a few years younger than him, but he believed that they were somehow of a different generation. He preferred to associate with adults.

In 1917, Hayek joined an artillery regiment in the Austro-Hungarian Army and fought on the Italian front. Hayek suffered damage to his hearing in his left ear during the war and was decorated for bravery.

Hayek then decided to pursue an academic career, determined to help avoid the mistakes that had led to the war. Hayek said of his experience: &quot;The decisive influence was really World War I. It&#x27;s bound to draw your attention to the problems of political organization&quot;.

=== Education ===
At the University of Vienna, Hayek initially studied mostly philosophy, psychology and economics. The university allowed students to choose their subjects freely and there was not much obligatory written work, or tests except main exams at the end of the study. By the end of his studies Hayek became more interested in economics, mostly for financial and career reasons; he planned to combine law and economics to start a career in diplomatic service. He earned doctorates in law and political science in 1921 and 1923 respectively.

For a short time, when the University of Vienna closed he studied in Constantin von Monakow&#x27;s Institute of Brain Anatomy, where Hayek spent much of his time staining brain cells. Hayek&#x27;s time in Monakow&#x27;s lab and his deep interest in the work of Ernst Mach inspired his first intellectual project, eventually published as &quot;The Sensory Order&quot; (1952). It located connective learning at the physical and neurological levels, rejecting the &quot;sense data&quot; associationism of the empiricists and logical positivists. Hayek presented his work to the private seminar he had created with Herbert Furth called the Geistkreis.

During Hayek&#x27;s years at the University of Vienna, Carl Menger&#x27;s work on the explanatory strategy of social science and Friedrich von Wieser&#x27;s commanding presence in the classroom left a lasting influence on him. Upon the completion of his examinations, Hayek was hired by Ludwig von Mises on the recommendation of Wieser as a specialist for the Austrian government working on the legal and economic details of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Between 1923 and 1924, Hayek worked as a research assistant to Professor Jeremiah Jenks of New York University, compiling macroeconomic data on the American economy and the operations of the Federal Reserve. He was influenced by Wesley Clair Mitchell and started a doctoral program on problems of monetary stabilization but didn&#x27;t finish it. His time in America wasn&#x27;t especially happy. He had very limited social contacts, missed the cultural life of Vienna, and was troubled by his poverty. His family&#x27;s financial situation deteriorated significantly after the War.

Initially sympathetic to Wieser&#x27;s democratic socialism, Hayek found Marxism rigid and unattractive, and his mild socialist phase lasted until he was about 23. Hayek&#x27;s economic thinking shifted away from socialism and toward the classical liberalism of Carl Menger after reading von Mises&#x27; book &quot;Socialism&quot;. It was sometime after reading &quot;Socialism&quot; that Hayek began attending von Mises&#x27; private seminars, joining several of his university friends, including Fritz Machlup, Alfred Schutz, Felix Kaufmann and Gottfried Haberler, who were also participating in Hayek&#x27;s own more general and private seminar. It was during this time that he also encountered and befriended noted political philosopher Eric Voegelin, with whom he retained a long-standing relationship.

=== London School of Economics ===
With the help of Mises, in the late 1920s, he founded and served as director of the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research before joining the faculty of the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1931 at the behest of Lionel Robbins. Upon his arrival in London, Hayek was quickly recognised as one of the leading economic theorists in the world and his development of the economics of processes in time and the co-ordination function of prices inspired the ground-breaking work of John Hicks, Abba P. Lerner and many others in the development of modern microeconomics.

In 1932, Hayek suggested that private investment in the public markets was a better road to wealth and economic co-ordination in Britain than government spending programs as argued in an exchange of letters with John Maynard Keynes, co-signed with Lionel Robbins and others in &quot;The Times&quot;. The nearly decade long deflationary depression in Britain dating from Winston Churchill&#x27;s decision in 1925 to return Britain to the gold standard at the old pre-war and pre-inflationary par was the public policy backdrop for Hayek&#x27;s dissenting engagement with Keynes over British monetary and fiscal policy. Keynes called Hayek&#x27;s book &quot;Prices and Production&quot; &quot;one of the most frightful muddles I have ever read&quot;, famously adding: &quot;It is an extraordinary example of how, starting with a mistake, a remorseless logician can end in Bedlam&quot;.

Notable economists who studied with Hayek at the LSE in the 1930s and 1940s include Arthur Lewis, Ronald Coase, William Baumol, CH Douglas, John Kenneth Galbraith, Leonid Hurwicz, Abba Lerner, Nicholas Kaldor, George Shackle, Thomas Balogh, L. K. Jha, Arthur Seldon, Paul Rosenstein-Rodan and Oskar Lange. Some were supportive and some were critical of his ideas. Hayek also taught or tutored many other LSE students, including David Rockefeller.

In 1937, Hayek gave a summer course at the Geneva Graduate Institute, then a stronghold of neoliberal thought that was home to Ludwig von Mises. Unwilling to return to Austria after the &quot;Anschluss&quot; brought it under the control of Nazi Germany in 1938, Hayek remained in Britain. Hayek and his children became British subjects in 1938. He held this status for the remainder of his life, but he did not live in Great Britain after 1950. He lived in the United States from 1950 to 1962 and then mostly in Germany, but also briefly in Austria.

In 1947, Hayek was elected a Fellow of the Econometric Society.

=== &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; ===

Hayek was concerned about the general view in Britain&#x27;s academia that fascism was a capitalist reaction to socialism and &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; arose from those concerns. In the book, Hayek of the danger of tyranny that inevitably results from government control of economic decision-making through central planning.&quot; He further argues that the abandonment of individualism and classical liberalism inevitably leads to a loss of freedom, the creation of an oppressive society, the tyranny of a dictator, and the serfdom of the individual. Hayek challenged the view, popular among British Marxists, that fascism (including Nazism) was a capitalist reaction against socialism. He argued that fascism, Nazism, and state-socialism had common roots in central economic planning and empowering the state over the individual.

The title was inspired by the French classical liberal thinker Alexis de Tocqueville&#x27;s writings on the &quot;road to servitude&quot;. It was first published in Britain by Routledge in March 1944 and was quite popular, leading Hayek to call it &quot;that unobtainable book&quot; also due in part to wartime paper rationing. When it was published in the United States by the University of Chicago in September of that year, it achieved greater popularity than in Britain. At the instigation of editor Max Eastman, the American magazine &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; also published an abridged version in April 1945, enabling &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; to reach a far wider audience than academics. The book is widely popular among those advocating individualism and classical liberalism.

=== Chicago ===
In 1950, Hayek left the London School of Economics. After spending the 1949–1950 academic year as a visiting professor at the University of Arkansas, Hayek was conferred professorship by the University of Chicago, where he became a professor in the Committee on Social Thought. Hayek&#x27;s salary was funded not by the university, but by an outside foundation, the William Volker Fund.

Hayek had made contact with many at the University of Chicago in the 1940s, with Hayek&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; playing a seminal role in transforming how Milton Friedman and others understood how society works. Hayek conducted a number of influential faculty seminars while at the University of Chicago and a number of academics worked on research projects sympathetic to some of Hayek&#x27;s own, such as Aaron Director, who was active in the Chicago School in helping to fund and establish what became the &quot;Law and Society&quot; program in the University of Chicago Law School. Hayek, Frank Knight, Friedman and George Stigler worked together in forming the Mont Pèlerin Society, an international forum for neoliberals. Hayek and Friedman cooperated in support of the Intercollegiate Society of Individualists, later renamed the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, an American student organisation devoted to libertarian ideas.

Although they shared most political beliefs, disagreeing primarily on the question of monetary policy, Hayek and Friedman worked in separate university departments with different research interests and never developed a close working relationship. According to Alan O. Ebenstein, who wrote biographies of both of them, Hayek probably had a closer friendship with Keynes than with Friedman.

Hayek received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1954.

Another influential political philosopher and German-speaking exile at the University of Chicago at the time was Leo Strauss, but according to his student Joseph Cropsey who also knew Hayek, there was no contact between the two of them.

After editing a book on John Stuart Mill&#x27;s letters he planned to publish two books on the liberal order, &quot;The Constitution of Liberty&quot; and &quot;The Creative Powers of a Free Civilization&quot; (eventually the title for the second chapter of &quot;The Constitution of Liberty&quot;). He completed &quot;The Constitution of Liberty&quot; in May 1959, with publication in February 1960. Hayek was concerned that &quot;with that condition of men in which coercion of some by others is reduced as much as is possible in society&quot;. Hayek was disappointed that the book did not receive the same enthusiastic general reception as &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; had sixteen years before.

He left Chicago mostly because of financial reasons, being concerned about his pension provisions. His primary source of income was his salary, and he received some additional money from book royalties but avoided other lucrative sources of income for academics such as writing textbooks. He spent a lot on his frequent travels. He regularly spent summers in Austrian Alps, usually in the Tyrolean village Obergurgl where he enjoyed mountain climbing, and also visited Japan four times with additional trips to Tahiti, Fiji, Indonesia, Australia, New Caledonia and Ceylon. After his divorce, his financial situation worsened.

=== Freiburg and Salzburg ===
From 1962 until his retirement in 1968, he was a professor at the University of Freiburg, West Germany, where he began work on his next book, &quot;Law, Legislation and Liberty&quot;. Hayek regarded his years at Freiburg as &quot;very fruitful&quot;. Following his retirement, Hayek spent a year as a visiting professor of philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he continued work on &quot;Law, Legislation and Liberty&quot;, teaching a graduate seminar by the same name and another on the philosophy of social science. Preliminary drafts of the book were completed by 1970, but Hayek chose to rework his drafts and finally brought the book to publication in three volumes in 1973, 1976 and 1979.

Hayek became a professor at the University of Salzburg from 1969 to 1977 and then returned to Freiburg. When Hayek left Salzburg in 1977, he wrote: &quot;I made a mistake in moving to Salzburg&quot;. The economics department was small, and the library facilities were inadequate.

Although Hayek&#x27;s health suffered, and he fell into a depressionary bout, he continued to work on his magnum opus, &quot;Law, Legislation and Liberty&quot; in periods when he was feeling better.

=== Nobel Memorial Prize ===
On 9 October 1974, it was announced that Hayek would be awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics with Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal. He was surprised at being given the award and believed that he was given it with Myrdal to balance the award with someone from the opposite side of the political spectrum.

Among the reasons given, the committee stated, Hayek &quot;was one of the few economists who gave warning of the possibility of a major economic crisis before the great crash came in the autumn of 1929.&quot; The following year, Hayek further confirmed his original prediction. An interviewer asked, &quot;We understand that you were one of the only economists to forecast that America was headed for a depression, is that true?&quot; Hayek responded, &quot;Yes.&quot; However, no textual evidence has emerged of &quot;a prediction&quot;. Indeed, Hayek wrote on 26 October 1929, three days before the crash, &quot;at present there is no reason to expect a sudden crash of the New York stock exchange. ... The credit possibilities/conditions are, at any rate, currently very great, and therefore it appears assured that an outright crisis-like destruction of the present high [price] level should not be feared.&quot;

During the Nobel ceremony in December 1974, Hayek met the Russian dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Hayek later sent him a Russian translation of &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;. He spoke with apprehension at his award speech about the danger the authority of the prize would lend to an economist, but the prize brought much greater public awareness to the then controversial ideas of Hayek and was described by his biographer as &quot;the great rejuvenating event in his life&quot;.

=== British politics ===

In February 1975, Margaret Thatcher was elected leader of the British Conservative Party. The Institute of Economic Affairs arranged a meeting between Hayek and Thatcher in London soon after. During Thatcher&#x27;s only visit to the Conservative Research Department in the summer of 1975, a speaker had prepared a paper on why the &quot;middle way&quot; was the pragmatic path the Conservative Party should take, avoiding the extremes of left and right. Before he had finished, Thatcher &quot;reached into her briefcase and took out a book. It was Hayek&#x27;s &quot;The Constitution of Liberty&quot;. Interrupting our pragmatist, she held the book up for all of us to see. &#x27;This&#x27;, she said sternly, &#x27;is what we believe&#x27;, and banged Hayek down on the table&quot;.

Despite the media depictions of him as Thatcher&#x27;s guru and power behind the throne, the communication between him and the Prime Minister was not very regular, they were in contact only once or twice a year. Besides Thatcher, Hayek also had a significant influence on Enoch Powell, Keith Joseph, Nigel Lawson, Geoffrey Howe and John Biffen.

Hayek gained some controversy in 1978 by praising Thatcher&#x27;s anti-immigration policy proposal in an article which ignited numerous accusations of anti-Semitism and racism because of his reflections on the inability of assimilation of Eastern European Jews in the Vienna of his youth. He defended himself by explaining that he made no racial judgements, only highlighted the problems of acculturation.

In 1977, Hayek was critical of the Lib–Lab pact in which the British Liberal Party agreed to keep the British Labour government in office. Writing to &quot;The Times&quot;, Hayek said: &quot;May one who has devoted a large part of his life to the study of the history and the principles of liberalism point out that a party that keeps a socialist government in power has lost all title to the name &#x27;Liberal&#x27;. Certainly no liberal can in future vote &#x27;Liberal. Hayek was criticised by Liberal politicians Gladwyn Jebb and Andrew Phillips, who both claimed that the purpose of the pact was to discourage socialist legislation.

Lord Gladwyn pointed out that the German Free Democrats were in coalition with the German Social Democrats. Hayek was defended by Professor Antony Flew, who stated that—unlike the British Labour Party—the German Social Democrats had since the late 1950s abandoned public ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange and had instead embraced the social market economy.

In 1978, Hayek came into conflict with Liberal Party leader David Steel, who argued that liberty was possible only with &quot;social justice and an equitable distribution of wealth and power, which in turn require a degree of active government intervention&quot; and that the Conservative Party were more concerned with the connection between liberty and private enterprise than between liberty and democracy. Hayek argued that a limited democracy might be better than other forms of limited government at protecting liberty, but that an unlimited democracy was worse than other forms of unlimited government because &quot;its government loses the power even to do what it thinks right if any group on which its majority depends thinks otherwise&quot;.

Hayek stated that if the Conservative leader had said &quot;that free choice is to be exercised more in the market place than in the ballot box, she has merely uttered the truism that the first is indispensable for individual freedom while the second is not: free choice can at least exist under a dictatorship that can limit itself but not under the government of an unlimited democracy which cannot&quot;.

Hayek supported Britain in the Falklands War, writing that it would be justified to attack Argentinian territory instead of just defending the islands, which earned him a lot of criticism in Argentina, a country which he also visited several times. He was also displeased by the weak response of the United States to the Iran hostage crisis, claiming that an ultimatum should be issued and Iran bombed if they do not comply. He supported Ronald Reagan&#x27;s decision to keep high defence spending, believing that a strong US military is a guarantee of world peace and necessary to keep the Soviet Union under control. President Reagan listed Hayek as among the two or three people who most influenced his philosophy and welcomed him to the White House as a special guest. Senator Barry Goldwater listed Hayek as his favourite political philosopher and congressman Jack Kemp named him an inspiration for his political career.

=== Recognition ===
In 1980, Hayek was one of twelve Nobel laureates to meet with Pope John Paul II &quot;to dialogue, discuss views in their fields, communicate regarding the relationship between Catholicism and science, and &#x27;bring to the Pontiff&#x27;s attention the problems which the Nobel Prize Winners, in their respective fields of study, consider to be the most urgent for contemporary man&#x27;&quot;

Hayek was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 1984 Birthday Honours by Elizabeth II on the advice of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for his &quot;services to the study of economics&quot;. Hayek had hoped to receive a baronetcy and after being awarded the CH sent a letter to his friends requesting that he be called the English version of Friedrich (i.e. Frederick) from now on. After his twenty-minute audience with the Queen, he was &quot;absolutely besotted&quot; with her according to his daughter-in-law Esca Hayek. Hayek said a year later that he was &quot;amazed by her. That ease and skill, as if she&#x27;d known me all my life&quot;. The audience with the Queen was followed by a dinner with family and friends at the Institute of Economic Affairs. When later that evening Hayek was dropped off at the Reform Club, he commented: &quot;I&#x27;ve just had the happiest day of my life&quot;.

In 1991, President George H. W. Bush awarded Hayek the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the two highest civilian awards in the United States, for a &quot;lifetime of looking beyond the horizon&quot;.

=== Personal life ===
In August 1926, Hayek married Helen Berta Maria von Fritsch (1901–1960), a secretary at the civil service office where he worked. They had two children together. Upon the close of World War II, Hayek restarted a relationship with an old girlfriend, who had married since they first met, but kept it secret until 1948. Hayek and Fritsch divorced in July 1950 and he married his cousin Helene Bitterlich (1900–1996) just a few weeks later, after moving to Arkansas to take advantage of permissive divorce laws. His wife and children were offered settlement and compensation for accepting a divorce. The divorce caused some scandal at LSE, where certain academics refused to have anything to do with Hayek. In a 1978 interview to explain his actions, Hayek stated that he was unhappy in his first marriage and as his wife would not grant him a divorce he had taken steps to obtain one unilaterally.

For a time after his divorce, Hayek rarely visited his children, but kept up more regular contact with them in his older years after moving to Europe. Hayek&#x27;s son, Laurence Hayek (1934–2004) was a distinguished microbiologist. His daughter Christine was an entomologist at the British Museum of Natural History, and she cared for him during his last years, when he had declining health.

Hayek had a lifelong interest in biology and was also concerned with ecology and environmental protection. After being awarded his Nobel Prize, he offered his name to be used for endorsements by World Wildlife Fund, National Audubon Society, and the National Trust, a British conservationist organisation. Evolutionary biology was simply one of his interests in natural sciences. Hayek also had an interest in epistemology, which he often applied to his own thinking, as a social scientist. He held that methodological differences in the social sciences and in natural sciences were key to understanding why incompetent policies are often allowed.

Hayek was brought up in a non-religious setting and decided from age 15 that he was an agnostic.

Hayek died on 23 March 1992, aged 92, in Freiburg, Germany, where he had lived since leaving Chicago in 1961. Despite his advanced age by the 1980s, he continued to write, even purportedly finishing a book, &quot;The Fatal Conceit&quot;, in 1988, although its actual authorship is unclear.
He was buried on 4 April in the Neustift am Walde cemetery in the northern outskirts of Vienna according to the Catholic rite.

== Work and views ==
=== Business cycle ===
Ludwig von Mises had earlier applied the concept of marginal utility to the value of money in his &quot;Theory of Money and Credit&quot; (1912) in which he also proposed an explanation for &quot;industrial fluctuations&quot; based on the ideas of the old British Currency School and of Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Hayek used this body of work as a starting point for his own interpretation of the business cycle, elaborating what later became known as the Austrian theory of the business cycle. Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in more detail in his book, published in 1929, an English translation of which appeared in 1933 as &quot;Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle&quot;. There, Hayek argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle. In his &quot;Prices and Production&quot; (1931), Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the central bank&#x27;s inflationary credit expansion and its transmission over time, leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low interest rates. Hayek argued that &quot;the past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism, money, from itself being regulated by the market process&quot;.

Hayek&#x27;s analysis was based on Eugen Böhm von Bawerk&#x27;s concept of the &quot;average period of production&quot; and on the effects that monetary policy could have upon it. In accordance with the reasoning later outlined in his essay &quot;The Use of Knowledge in Society&quot; (1945), Hayek argued that a monopolistic governmental agency like a central bank can neither possess the relevant information which should govern supply of money, nor have the ability to use it correctly.

In 1929, Lionel Robbins assumed the helm of the London School of Economics (LSE). Eager to promote alternatives to what he regarded as the narrow approach of the school of economic thought that then dominated the English-speaking academic world (centred at the University of Cambridge and deriving largely from the work of Alfred Marshall), Robbins invited Hayek to join the faculty at LSE, which he did in 1931. According to Nicholas Kaldor, Hayek&#x27;s theory of the time-structure of capital and of the business cycle initially &quot;fascinated the academic world&quot; and appeared to offer a less &quot;facile and superficial&quot; understanding of macroeconomics than the Cambridge school&#x27;s.

Also in 1931, Hayek crititicised John Maynard Keynes&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Money&quot; (1930) in his &quot;Reflections on the pure theory of Mr. J.M. Keynes&quot; and published his lectures at the LSE in book form as &quot;Prices and Production&quot;. For Keynes, unemployment and idle resources are caused by a lack of effective demand, but for Hayek they stem from a previous unsustainable episode of easy money and artificially low interest rates. Keynes asked his friend Piero Sraffa to respond. Sraffa elaborated on the effect of inflation-induced &quot;forced savings&quot; on the capital sector and about the definition of a &quot;natural&quot; interest rate in a growing economy (see Sraffa–Hayek debate). Others who responded negatively to Hayek&#x27;s work on the business cycle included John Hicks, Frank Knight and Gunnar Myrdal, who, later on, would share the Sveriges-Riksbank Prize in Economics with him. Kaldor later wrote that Hayek&#x27;s &quot;Prices and Production&quot; had produced &quot;a remarkable crop of critics&quot; and that the total number of pages in British and American journals dedicated to the resulting debate &quot;could rarely have been equalled in the economic controversies of the past&quot;.

Hayek&#x27;s work, throughout the 1940s, was largely ignored, except for scathing critiques by Nicholas Kaldor. Lionel Robbins himself, who had embraced the Austrian theory of the business cycle in &quot;The Great Depression&quot; (1934), later regretted having written the book and accepted many of the Keynesian counter-arguments.

Hayek never produced the book-length treatment of &quot;the dynamics of capital&quot; that he had promised in the &quot;Pure Theory of Capital.&quot; At the University of Chicago, Hayek was not part of the economics department and did not influence the rebirth of neoclassical theory that took place there (see Chicago school of economics). When in 1974 he shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics with Myrdal, the latter complained about being paired with an &quot;ideologue&quot;. Milton Friedman declared himself &quot;an enormous admirer of Hayek, but not for his economics&quot;. Milton Friedman also commented on some of his writings, saying &quot;I think &quot;Prices and Production&quot; is a very flawed book. I think his [&quot;Pure Theory of Capital&quot;] is unreadable. On the other hand, &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; is one of the great books of our time&quot;.

=== Economic calculation problem ===

Building on the earlier work of Mises and others, Hayek also argued that while in centrally planned economies an individual or a select group of individuals must determine the distribution of resources, these planners will never have enough information to carry out this allocation reliably. This argument, first proposed by Max Weber and Ludwig von Mises, says that the efficient exchange and use of resources can be maintained only through the price mechanism in free markets (see economic calculation problem).

In 1935, Hayek published &quot;Collectivist Economic Planning&quot;, a collection of essays from an earlier debate that had been initiated by Mises. Hayek included Mises&#x27;s essay in which Mises argued that rational planning was impossible under socialism.

Socialist Oskar Lange responded by invoking general equilibrium theory, which they argued disproved Mises&#x27;s thesis. They noted that the difference between a planned and a free market system lay in who was responsible for solving the equations. They argued that if some of the prices chosen by socialist managers were wrong, gluts or shortages would appear, signalling them to adjust the prices up or down, just as in a free market. Through such a trial and error, a socialist economy could mimic the efficiency of a free market system while avoiding its many problems.

Hayek challenged this vision in a series of contributions. In &quot;Economics and Knowledge&quot; (1937), he pointed out that the standard equilibrium theory assumed that all agents have full and correct information, and how, in his mind, in the real world different individuals have different bits of knowledge and furthermore some of what they believe is wrong.

In &quot;The Use of Knowledge in Society&quot; (1945), Hayek argued that the price mechanism serves to share and synchronise local and personal knowledge, allowing society&#x27;s members to achieve diverse and complicated ends through a principle of spontaneous self-organization. He contrasted the use of the price mechanism with central planning, arguing that the former allows for more rapid adaptation to changes in particular circumstances of time and place. Thus, Hayek set the stage for Oliver Williamson&#x27;s later contrast between markets and hierarchies as alternative co-ordination mechanisms for economic transactions. He used the term catallaxy to describe a &quot;self-organizing system of voluntary co-operation&quot;. Hayek&#x27;s research into this argument was specifically cited by the Nobel Committee in its press release awarding Hayek the Nobel prize.

=== Investment and choice ===
Hayek made breakthroughs in the choice theory, and examined the inter-relations between non-permanent production goods and &quot;latent&quot; or potentially economic permanent resources, building on the choice theoretical insight that &quot;processes that take more time will evidently not be adopted unless they yield a greater return than those that take less time&quot;.

=== Philosophy of science ===

During World War II, Hayek began the Abuse of Reason project. His goal was to show how a number of then-popular doctrines and beliefs had a common origin in some fundamental misconceptions about the social science.

Ideas were developed in &quot;The Counter-Revolution of Science&quot; in 1952 and in some of Hayek&#x27;s later essays in the philosophy of science such as &quot;Degrees of Explanation&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Theory of Complex Phenomena&quot; (1964).

In &quot;Counter-Revolution&quot;, for example, Hayek observed that the hard sciences attempt to remove the &quot;human factor&quot; to obtain objective and strictly controlled results: 

Meanwhile, the soft sciences are attempting to measure human action itself: 

He notes that these are mutually exclusive and that social sciences should not attempt to impose positivist methodology, nor to claim objective or definite results:

=== Psychology ===
Hayek&#x27;s first academic essay was a psychological work titled &quot;Contributions to the Theory of the Development of Consciousness&quot; (&quot;Beiträge zur Theorie der Entwicklung des Bewußtseins&quot;) In &quot;The Sensory Order: An Inquiry into the Foundations of Theoretical Psychology&quot; (1952), Hayek independently developed a &quot;Hebbian learning&quot; model of learning and memory—an idea he first conceived in 1920 prior to his study of economics. Hayek&#x27;s expansion of the &quot;Hebbian synapse&quot; construction into a global brain theory received attention in neuroscience, cognitive science, computer science and evolutionary psychology by scientists such as Gerald Edelman, Vittorio Guidano and Joaquin Fuster.

&quot;The Sensory Order&quot; can be viewed as a development of his attack on scientism. Hayek posited two orders, namely the sensory order that we experience and the natural order that natural science revealed. Hayek thought that the sensory order actually is a product of the brain. He described the brain as a very complex yet self-ordering hierarchical classification system, a huge network of connections. Because of the nature of the classifier system, richness of our sensory experience can exist. Hayek&#x27;s description posed problems to behaviorism, whose proponents took the sensory order as fundamental.

===International relations===
Hayek was a lifelong federalist. He joined several pan-European and pro-federalist movements throughout his career, and called for federal ties between the U.K. and Europe, and between Europe and the United States. After the 1950s, when the Cold War began in earnest, Hayek largely kept his federalist proposals out of the public sphere, although he did propose to federate Jerusalem as late as the 1970s.

Hayek argued that closer economic ties without closer political ties would lead to more problems because interest groups in nation-states would best be able to counter the internationalisation of markets that comes with closer economic ties by appealing to nationalism. Much of his time in the pro-federalist and pan-European groups was spent arguing with pro-federal and pan-European democratic socialists over the proper extent of a world federal government. Hayek argued that such a world government should do little more than act as a negative check on national sovereignties and serve as a focal point for collective defense.

As the Cold War heated up, Hayek grew more hawkish and he pushed his federal proposals onto the backburner in favour of more traditional public policy proposals that acknowledged and respected the sovereignty of nation-states. Yet Hayek never disavowed his famous call for &quot;the abrogation of national sovereignties&quot; and his lifetime of work in the area of international relations continues to attract attention from scholars searching for federalist answers to contemporary problems in international relations.

=== Social and political philosophy ===
==== Two traditions in the theory of liberty ====
In the latter half of his career, Hayek made a number of contributions to social and political philosophy which he based on his views on the limits of human knowledge and the idea of spontaneous order in social institutions. He argues in favour of a society organised around a market order in which the apparatus of state is employed almost (though not entirely) exclusively to enforce the legal order (consisting of abstract rules and not particular commands) necessary for a market of free individuals to function. These ideas were informed by a moral philosophy derived from epistemological concerns regarding the inherent limits of human knowledge. Hayek argued that his ideal individualistic and free-market polity would be self-regulating to such a degree that it would be &quot;a society which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men for running it&quot;.

He discusses the contrasting traditions of liberty—British and French—in the theory of freedom. The British tradition, influenced by thinkers like David Hume and Adam Smith, emphasises the organic growth of institutions and the spontaneous evolution of society. It recognises that political order arises from the cumulative experience and success of individuals, rather than from deliberate design. In contrast, the French tradition, rooted in Cartesian rationalism, seeks to construct a utopia based on a belief in the unlimited powers of human reason. The French tradition, that Hayek called constructivist rationalism, gained influence over time, partly due to its assumptions about human ambition and pride. However, according to Hayek, the British tradition, with its emphasis on the gradual development of civilization and the role of individual freedom, provides a more valid theory of liberty.

==== Spontaneous order ====

Hayek viewed the free price system not as a conscious invention (that which is intentionally designed by man), but as spontaneous order or what Scottish philosopher Adam Ferguson referred to as &quot;the result of human action but not of human design&quot;. For instance, Hayek put the price mechanism on the same level as language, which he developed in his price signal theory.

Hayek attributed the birth of civilisation to private property in his book &quot;The Fatal Conceit&quot; (1988). He explained that price signals are the only means of enabling each economic decision maker to communicate tacit knowledge or dispersed knowledge to each other to solve the economic calculation problem. Alain de Benoist of the &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot; (New Right) produced a highly critical essay on Hayek&#x27;s work in an issue of &quot;Telos&quot;, citing the flawed assumptions behind Hayek&#x27;s idea of &quot;spontaneous order&quot; and the authoritarian and totalising implications of his free-market ideology.

Hayek&#x27;s concept of the market as a spontaneous order has been applied to ecosystems to defend a broadly non-interventionist policy. Like the market, ecosystems contain complex networks of information, involve an ongoing dynamic process, contain orders within orders and the entire system operates without being directed by a conscious mind. On this analysis, species takes the place of price as a visible element of the system formed by a complex set of largely unknowable elements. Human ignorance about the countless interactions between the organisms of an ecosystem limits our ability to manipulate nature.

Hayek&#x27;s price signal concept is in relation to how consumers are often unaware of specific events that change market, yet change their decisions, simply because the price goes up. Thus pricing communicates information.

==== Criticism of collectivism ====
Hayek was one of the leading academic critics of collectivism in the 20th century. In Hayek&#x27;s view, the central role of the state should be to maintain the rule of law, with as little arbitrary intervention as possible. In his popular book &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; (1944) and in subsequent academic works, Hayek argued that socialism required central economic planning and that such planning in turn leads towards totalitarianism.

In &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;, Hayek wrote:

Hayek posited that a central planning authority would have to be endowed with powers that would impact and ultimately control social life because the knowledge required for centrally planning an economy is inherently decentralised, and would need to be brought under control.

Though Hayek did argue that the state should provide law centrally, others have pointed out that this contradicts his arguments about the role of judges in &quot;discovering&quot; the law, suggesting that Hayek would have supported decentralized provision of legal services.

Hayek also wrote that the state can play a role in the economy, specifically in creating a safety net, saying: There is no reason why, in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom; that is: some minimum of food, shelter and clothing, sufficient to preserve health. Nor is there any reason why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision.

Hayek&#x27;s argument has been criticized as a slippery slope argument and therefore fallacious. Peter Boettke has argued that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the book and Hayek&#x27;s point is about what central planning directly entails, not what it is likely to lead to.

&quot;The Denationalisation of Money&quot; is one of his literary works, in which he advocated the establishment of competitions in issuing moneys.

==== Social safety nets ====
With regard to a social safety net, Hayek advocated &quot;some provision for those threatened by the extremes of indigence or starvation due to circumstances beyond their control&quot; and argued that the &quot;necessity of some such arrangement in an industrial society is unquestioned—be it only in the interest of those who require protection against acts of desperation on the part of the needy&quot;. Summarizing Hayek&#x27;s views on the topic, journalist Nicholas Wapshott has argued that &quot;[Hayek] advocated mandatory universal health care and unemployment insurance, enforced, if not directly provided, by the state&quot;. Critical theorist Bernard Harcourt has argued further that &quot;Hayek was adamant about this&quot;. In 1944, Hayek wrote in &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;: 

In 1973, Hayek reiterated in &quot;Law, Legislation and Liberty&quot;: There is no reason why in a free society government should not assure to all, protection against severe deprivation in the form of an assured minimum income, or a floor below which nobody need to descend. To enter into such an insurance against extreme misfortune may well be in the interest of all; or it may be felt to be a clear moral duty of all to assist, within the organised community, those who cannot help themselves. So long as such a uniform minimum income is provided outside the market to all those who, for any reason, are unable to earn in the market an adequate maintenance, this need not lead to a restriction of freedom, or conflict with the Rule of law.

Political theorist Adam James Tebble has argued that Hayek&#x27;s concession of a social minimum provided by the state introduces a conceptual tension with his epistemically derived commitment to private property rights, free markets, and spontaneous order. Hayek&#x27;s views on social welfare policies have also been the subject of criticism. Critics contend that his opposition to government intervention in the economy fails to recognize the need for social safety nets and other forms of support for vulnerable populations. Furthermore, it has been argued that his views on welfare policy contradict his views on social justice.

==== Criticism of &quot;social justice&quot; ====
Although Hayek believed in a society governed by laws, he disapproved of the notion of &quot;social justice&quot;. He compared the market to a game in which &quot;there is no point in calling the outcome just or unjust&quot; and argued that &quot;social justice is an empty phrase with no determinable content&quot;. Likewise, &quot;the results of the individual&#x27;s efforts are necessarily unpredictable, and the question as to whether the resulting distribution of incomes is just has no meaning&quot;. He generally regarded government redistribution of income or capital as an unacceptable intrusion upon individual freedom, saying that &quot;the principle of distributive justice, once introduced, would not be fulfilled until the whole of society was organized in accordance with it. This would produce a kind of society which in all essential respects would be the opposite of a free society&quot;.

==== Liberalism and skepticism ====
Arthur M. Diamond argues Hayek&#x27;s problems arise when he goes beyond claims that can be evaluated within economic science. Diamond argued: The human mind, Hayek says, is not just limited in its ability to synthesize a vast array of concrete facts, it is also limited in its ability to give a deductively sound ground to ethics. Here is where the tension develops, for he also wants to give a reasoned moral defense of the free market. He is an intellectual skeptic who wants to give political philosophy a secure intellectual foundation. It is thus not too surprising that what results is confused and contradictory.

Chandran Kukathas argues that Hayek&#x27;s defence of liberalism is unsuccessful because it rests on presuppositions that are incompatible. The unresolved dilemma of his political philosophy is how to mount a systematic defence of liberalism if one emphasizes the limited capacity of reason. Norman P. Barry similarly notes that the &quot;critical rationalism&quot; in Hayek&#x27;s writings appears incompatible with &quot;a certain kind of fatalism, that we must wait for evolution to pronounce its verdict&quot;. Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argue that the element of paradox exists in the views of Hayek. Noting Hayek&#x27;s vigorous defense of &quot;invisible hand&quot; evolution that Hayek claimed created better economic institutions than could be created by rational design, Friedman pointed out the irony that Hayek was then proposing to replace the monetary system thus created with a deliberate construct of his own design. John N. Gray summarized this view as &quot;his scheme for an ultra-liberal constitution was a prototypical version of the philosophy he had attacked&quot;. Bruce Caldwell wrote that &quot;[i]f one is judging his work against the standard of whether he provided a finished political philosophy, Hayek clearly did not succeed&quot;, although he thinks that &quot;economists may find Hayek&#x27;s political writings useful&quot;.

==== Dictatorship and totalitarianism ====

Hayek sent António de Oliveira Salazar a copy of &quot;The Constitution of Liberty&quot; (1960) in 1962. Hayek hoped that his book—this &quot;preliminary sketch of new constitutional principles&quot;—&quot;may assist&quot; Salazar &quot;in his endeavour to design a constitution which is proof against the abuses of democracy&quot;.

Hayek visited Chile in the 1970s and 1980s during the Government Junta of general Augusto Pinochet and accepted being appointed Honorary Chairman of the Centro de Estudios Públicos, the think tank formed by the economists who transformed Chile into a free market economy.

Asked about the military dictatorship of Chile by a Chilean interviewer, Hayek is translated from German to Spanish to English as having said the following: As long term institutions, I am totally against dictatorships. But a dictatorship may be a necessary system for a transitional period. [...] Personally I prefer a liberal dictatorship to democratic government devoid of liberalism. My personal impression—and this is valid for South America—is that in Chile, for example, we will witness a transition from a dictatorial government to a liberal government.

In a letter to the &quot;London Times&quot;, he defended the Pinochet regime and said that he had &quot;not been able to find a single person even in much maligned Chile who did not agree that personal freedom was much greater under Pinochet than it had been under Allende&quot;. Hayek admitted that &quot;it is not very likely that this will succeed, even if, at a particular point in time, it may be the only hope there is&quot;, but he explained that &quot;[i]t is not certain hope, because it will always depend on the goodwill of an individual, and there are very few individuals one can trust. But if it is the sole opportunity which exists at a particular moment it may be the best solution despite this. And only if and when the dictatorial government is visibly directing its steps towards limited democracy&quot;.

For Hayek, the distinction between authoritarianism and totalitarianism has much importance and he was at pains to emphasise his opposition to totalitarianism, noting that the concept of transitional dictatorship which he defended was characterised by authoritarianism, not totalitarianism. For example, when Hayek visited Venezuela in May 1981, he was asked to comment on the prevalence of totalitarian regimes in Latin America. In reply, Hayek warned against confusing &quot;totalitarianism with authoritarianism&quot; and said that he was unaware of &quot;any totalitarian governments in Latin America. The only one was Chile under Allende&quot;. For Hayek, the word &quot;totalitarian&quot; signifies something very specific, namely the intention to &quot;organize the whole of society&quot; to attain a &quot;definite social goal&quot; which is stark in contrast to &quot;liberalism and individualism&quot;. He claimed that democracy can also be repressive and totalitarian; in &quot;The Constitution of Liberty&quot; he often refers to Jacob Talmon&#x27;s concept of totalitarian democracy.

==== Immigration, nationalism and race ====
Hayek was skeptical about international immigration and supported Thatcher&#x27;s anti-immigration policies. In &quot;Law, Legislation and Liberty&quot; he elaborated:
Freedom of migration is one of the widely accepted and wholly admirable principles of liberalism. But should this generally give the stranger a right to settle down in a community in which he is not welcome? Has he a claim to be given a job or be sold a house if no resident is willing to do so? He clearly should be entitled to accept a job or buy a house if offered to him. But have the individual inhabitants a duty to offer either to him? Or ought it to be an offence if they voluntarily agree not to do so? Swiss and Tyrolese villages have a way of keeping out strangers which neither infringe nor rely on any law. Is this anti-liberal or morally justified? For established old communities I have no certain answers to these questions.
He was mainly preoccupied with practical problems concerning immigration:
There exist, of course, other reasons why such restrictions appear unavoidable so long as certain differences in national or ethnic traditions (especially differences in the rate of propagation) exist-which in turn are not likely to disappear so long as restrictions on migration continue. We must face the fact that we here encounter a limit to the universal application of those liberal principles of policy which the existing facts of the present world make unavoidable.
He was not sympathetic to nationalist ideas and was afraid that mass immigration might revive nationalist sentiment among domestic population and ruin the postwar progress that was made among Western nations. He additionally explained:
However far modern man accepts in principle the ideal that the same rules should apply to all men, in fact he does concede it only to those whom he regards as similar to himself, and only slowly learns to extend the range of those he does accept as his likes. There is little legislation can do to speed up this process and much it may do to reverse it by re-awakening sentiments that are already on the wane.
Despite his opposition to nationalism, Hayek made numerous controversial and inflammatory comments about specific ethnic groups. Answering an interview question about people he cannot deal with he mentioned his dislike of Middle Eastern populations, claiming they were dishonest, and also expressed &quot;profound dislike&quot; of Indian students at London School of Economics, saying that were usually &quot;detestable sons of Bengali moneylenders&quot;. He maintained that such attitudes were not based on any racial feeling. During World War II he discussed the possibility of sending his children to the United States but was concerned that they might be placed with a &quot;coloured family&quot;. In a later interview, questioned about his attitude towards Black people, he said laconically that he &quot;did not like dancing Negroes&quot; and on another occasion he ridiculed the decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize to Martin Luther King Jr. He also made negative comments about awarding the Prize to Ralph Bunche, Albert Luthuli, and his LSE colleague W. Arthur Lewis who he described as an &quot;unusually able West Indian negro&quot;. In 1978 Hayek made a month-long visit to South Africa (his third) where he gave numerous lectures, interviews, and met prominent politicians and business leaders, unconcerned about possible propagandistic effect of his tour for Apartheid regime. He expressed his opposition to some of the government policies, believing that publicly funded institutions should treat all citizens equally, but also claimed that private institutions have the right to discriminate. Additionally, he condemned the &quot;scandalous&quot; hostility and interference of the international community in South African internal affairs. He further explained his attitude:
People in South Africa have to deal with their own problems, and the idea that you can use external pressure to change people, who after all have built up a civilization of a kind, seems to me morally a very doubtful belief.
While Hayek gave somewhat ambiguous comments on the injustices of Apartheid and proper role of the state, some of his Mont Pelerin colleagues, such as John Davenport and Wilhelm Röpke, were more ardent supporters of South African government and criticized Hayek for being too soft on the subject.

==== Inequality and class ====
In &quot;The Constitution of Liberty&quot;, Hayek wrote:
Yet is it really so obvious that the tennis or golf professional is a more useful member of society than the wealthy amateurs who devoted their time to perfecting these games? Or that the paid curator of a public museum is more useful than a private collector? Before the reader answers these questions too hastily, I would ask him to consider whether there would ever have been golf or tennis professionals or museum curators if wealthy amateurs had not preceded them. Can we not hope that other new interests will still arise from the playful explorations of those who can indulge in them for the short span of a human life? It is only natural that the development of the art of living and of the non-materialistic values should have profited most from the activities of those who had no material worries.

Hayek was against high taxes on inheritance, believing that it is natural function of the family to transmit standards, traditions and material goods. Without transmission of property, parents might try to secure the future of their children by placing them in prestigious and high-paying positions, as was customary in socialist countries, which creates even worse injustices. He was also strongly against progressive taxation, noting that in most countries additional taxes paid by the rich amount to insignificantly small amount of total tax revenue and that the only major result of the policy is &quot;gratification of the envy of the less-well-off&quot;. He also claimed that it is contrary to the idea of equality under the law and against democratic principle that the majority should not impose discriminatory rules against the minority.

== Influence and recognition ==

Hayek&#x27;s influence on the development of economics is widely acknowledged. With regard to the popularity of his Nobel acceptance lecture, Hayek is the second-most frequently cited economist (after Kenneth Arrow) in the Nobel lectures of the prize winners in economics. Hayek wrote critically there of the field of orthodox economics and neo-classical modelisation. A number of Nobel Laureates in economics, such as Vernon Smith and Herbert A. Simon, recognise Hayek as the greatest modern economist. Another Nobel winner, Paul Samuelson, believed that Hayek was worthy of his award, but nevertheless claimed that &quot;there were good historical reasons for fading memories of Hayek within the mainstream last half of the twentieth century economist fraternity. In 1931, Hayek&#x27;s &quot;Prices and Production&quot; had enjoyed an ultra-short Byronic success. In retrospect hindsight tells us that its mumbo-jumbo about the period of production grossly misdiagnosed the macroeconomics of the 1927–1931 (and the 1931–2007) historical scene&quot;. Despite this comment, Samuelson spent the last 50 years of his life obsessed with the problems of capital theory identified by Hayek and Böhm-Bawerk, and Samuelson flatly judged Hayek to have been right and his own teacher Joseph Schumpeter to have been wrong on the central economic question of the 20th century, the feasibility of socialist economic planning in a production goods dominated economy.

In 1944, he was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy after he was nominated for membership by Keynes.

Harvard economist and former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers explains Hayek&#x27;s place in modern economics: &quot;What&#x27;s the single most important thing to learn from an economics course today? What I tried to leave my students with is the view that the invisible hand is more powerful than the [un]hidden hand. Things will happen in well-organized efforts without direction, controls, plans. That&#x27;s the consensus among economists. That&#x27;s the Hayek legacy&quot;.

By 1947, Hayek was an organiser of the Mont Pelerin Society, a group of classical liberals who sought to oppose socialism. Hayek was also instrumental in the founding of the Institute of Economic Affairs, the right-wing libertarian and free-market think tank that inspired Thatcherism. He was in addition a member of the conservative and libertarian Philadelphia Society.

Hayek had a long-standing and close friendship with philosopher of science Karl Popper, who was also from Vienna. In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Popper stated: &quot;I think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps Alfred Tarski&quot;. Popper dedicated his &quot;Conjectures and Refutations&quot; to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, &quot;Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics&quot;, to Popper and in 1982 said that &quot;ever since his &quot;Logik der Forschung&quot; first came out in 1934, I have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology&quot;. Popper also participated in the inaugural meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society. Their friendship and mutual admiration do not change the fact that there are important differences between their ideas.

Hayek also played a central role in Milton Friedman&#x27;s intellectual development. Friedman wrote: My interest in public policy and political philosophy was rather casual before I joined the faculty of the University of Chicago. Informal discussions with colleagues and friends stimulated a greater interest, which was reinforced by Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s powerful book The Road to Serfdom, by my attendance at the first meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, and by discussions with Hayek after he joined the university faculty in 1950. In addition, Hayek attracted an exceptionally able group of students who were dedicated to a libertarian ideology. They started a student publication, The New Individualist Review, which was the outstanding libertarian journal of opinion for some years. I served as an adviser to the journal and published a number of articles in it...
While Friedman often mentioned Hayek as an important influence, Hayek rarely mentioned Friedman. He deeply disagreed with Chicago School methodology, quantitative and macroeconomic focus, and claimed that Friedman&#x27;s &quot;Essays in Positive Economics&quot; was as dangerous a book as Keynes&#x27; &quot;General Theory&quot;. Friedman also claimed that despite some Popperian influence, Hayek always retained basic Misesian praxeological views, which he found &quot;utterly nonsensical&quot;. He also noted that he admired Hayek only for his political works and disagreed with his technical economics; he called &quot;Prices and Production&quot; a &quot;very flawed book&quot; and &quot;The Pure Theory of Capital&quot; &quot;unreadable&quot;. There were occasional tensions at the Mont Pelerin meetings between Hayek&#x27;s and Friedman&#x27;s followers that sometimes threatened to split the Society. Although they worked at the same university and shared political beliefs, Hayek and Friedman rarely collaborated professionally and were not close friends.

Some radical libertarians had a negative view of Hayek and his milder form of liberalism. Ayn Rand disliked him, seeing him as a conservative and compromiser. In a letter to Rose Wilder Lane in 1946 she wrote:Now to your question: &#x27;Do those almost with us do more harm than 100% enemies?&#x27; I don&#x27;t think this can be answered with a flat &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no,&#x27; because the &#x27;almost&#x27; is such a wide term. There is one general rule to observe: those who are with us, but merely do not go far enough are the ones who may do us some good. Those who agree with us in some respects, yet preach contradictory ideas at the same time, are definitely more harmful than 100% enemies. As an example of the kind of &#x27;almost&#x27; I would tolerate, I&#x27;d name Ludwig von Mises. As an example of our most pernicious enemy, I would name Hayek. That one is real poison.
Hayek made no known written references to Rand.

Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales was influenced by Hayek&#x27;s ideas on spontaneous order and the Austrian School of economics, after being exposed to these ideas by Austrian economist and Mises Institute Senior Fellow Mark Thornton.

In the 21st century, some libertarian political scientists argue that Hayek would be in favor of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies due to its resistance to political pressure and due to Hayek&#x27;s emphasis of sound money and competition in currencies. They also argue that cryptocurrency and Bitcoin serve as a &quot;Hayekian escape&quot;, a method that people can use to escape the government&#x27;s currency monopoly.

=== Relation to conservatism ===
Hayek received new attention in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of conservative governments in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. After winning the 1979 United Kingdom general election, Margaret Thatcher appointed Keith Joseph, the director of the Hayekian Centre for Policy Studies, as her secretary of state for industry in an effort to redirect parliament&#x27;s economic strategies. Likewise, David Stockman, Ronald Reagan&#x27;s most influential financial official in 1981, was an acknowledged follower of Hayek.

Although usually identified as a conservative liberal or a liberal conservative, Hayek published an essay, &quot;Why I Am Not a Conservative&quot; (included as an appendix to &quot;The Constitution of Liberty&quot;), in which he criticized certain aspects of conservatism from a liberal perspective. Edmund Fawcett summarizes Hayek&#x27;s critique as follows:

Hayek identified himself as a classical liberal but noted that in the United States it had become almost impossible to use &quot;liberal&quot; in its original definition and the term &quot;libertarian&quot; was used instead. He also found libertarianism as a term &quot;singularly unattractive&quot; and offered the term &quot;Old Whig&quot; (a phrase borrowed from Edmund Burke) instead. In his later life, he said: &quot;I am becoming a Burkean Whig&quot;. Whiggery as a political doctrine had little affinity for classical political economy, the tabernacle of the Manchester School and William Gladstone.

In his 1956 preface to &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;, Hayek summarized all his disagreements with conservatism in this way:
Conservatism, though a necessary element in any stable society, is not a social program; in its paternalistic, nationalistic, and poweradoring tendencies it is often closer to socialism than true liberalism; and with its traditionalistic, anti-intellectual, and often mystical propensities it will never, except in short periods of disillusionment, appeal to the young and all those others who believe that some changes are desirable if this world is to become a better place. A conservative movement, by its very nature, is bound to be a defender of established privilege and to lean on the power of government for the protection of privilege. The essence of the liberal position, however, is the denial of all privilege, if privilege is understood in its proper and original meaning of the state granting and protecting rights to some which are not available on equal terms to others.

Samuel Brittan, concluded in 2010 that &quot;Hayek&#x27;s book [&quot;The Constitution of Liberty&quot;] is still probably the most comprehensive statement of the underlying ideas of the moderate free market philosophy espoused by neoliberals&quot;. Brittan adds that although Raymond Plant (2009) comes out in the end against Hayek&#x27;s doctrines, Plant gives &quot;The Constitution of Liberty&quot; a &quot;more thorough and fair-minded analysis than it has received even from its professed adherents&quot;. As a neo-liberal, he helped found the Mont Pelerin Society, a prominent neo-liberal think tank where many other minds, such as Mises and Friedman gathered.

Although Hayek is likely a student of the neo-liberal school of libertarianism, he is nonetheless influential in the conservative movement, mainly for his critique of collectivism.

=== Policy discussions ===
Hayek&#x27;s ideas on spontaneous order and the importance of prices in dealing with the knowledge problem inspired a debate on economic development and transition economies after the fall of the Berlin wall. For instance, economist Peter Boettke elaborated in detail on why reforming socialism failed and the Soviet Union broke down. Economist Ronald McKinnon uses Hayekian ideas to describe the challenges of transition from a centralized state and planned economy to a market economy. Former World Bank Chief Economist William Easterly emphasizes why foreign aid tends to have no effect at best in books such as &quot;The White Man&#x27;s Burden: Why the West&#x27;s Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good&quot;.

Since the 2007–2008 financial crisis, there is a renewed interest in Hayek&#x27;s core explanation of boom-and-bust cycles, which serves as an alternative explanation to that of the savings glut as launched by economist and former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke. Economists at the Bank for International Settlements, e.g. William R. White, emphasize the importance of Hayekian insights and the impact of monetary policies and credit growth as root causes of financial cycles. Andreas Hoffmann and Gunther Schnabl provide an international perspective and explain recurring financial cycles in the world economy as consequence of gradual interest rate cuts led by the central banks in the large advanced economies since the 1980s. Nicolas Cachanosky outlines the impact of American monetary policy on the production structure in Latin America.

In line with Hayek, an increasing number of contemporary researchers sees expansionary monetary policies and too low interest rates as mal-incentives and main drivers of financial crises in general and the subprime market crisis in particular. To prevent problems caused by monetary policy, Hayekian and Austrian economists discuss alternatives to current policies and organizations. For instance, Lawrence H. White argued in favor of free banking in the spirit of Hayek&#x27;s &quot;Denationalisation of Money&quot;. Along with market monetarist economist Scott Sumner, White also noted that the monetary policy norm that Hayek prescribed, first in &quot;Prices and Production&quot; (1931) and as late as the 1970s, was the stabilization of nominal income.

Hayek&#x27;s ideas find their way into the discussion of the post-Great Recession issues of secular stagnation. Monetary policy and mounting regulation are argued to have undermined the innovative forces of the market economies. Quantitative easing following the financial crises is argued to have not only conserved structural distortions in the economy, leading to a fall in trend-growth. It also created new distortions and contributes to distributional conflicts.

=== Central European politics ===
In the 1970s and 1980s, the writings of Hayek were a major influence on some of the future postsocialist economic and political elites in Central and Eastern Europe. Supporting examples include the following:

<text>Frederick Phillips Brooks Jr. (April 19, 1931 – November 17, 2022) was an American computer architect, software engineer, and computer scientist, best known for managing development of IBM&#x27;s System/360 family of mainframe computers and the OS/360 software support package, then later writing candidly about those experiences in his seminal book &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;.

In 1976, Brooks was elected to the National Academy of Engineering for &quot;contributions to computer system design and the development of academic programs in computer sciences&quot;.

Brooks received many awards, including the National Medal of Technology in 1985 and the Turing Award in 1999.

==Education==
Born on April 19, 1931, in Durham, North Carolina, he attended Duke University, graduating in 1953 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics, and he received a Ph.D. in applied mathematics (computer science) from Harvard University in 1956, supervised by Howard Aiken.

Brooks served as the graduate teaching assistant for Ken Iverson at Harvard&#x27;s graduate program in &quot;automatic data processing&quot;, the first such program in the world.

==Career and research==
Brooks joined IBM in 1956, working in Poughkeepsie, New York, and Yorktown, New York. He worked on the architecture of the IBM 7030 Stretch, a $10 million scientific supercomputer of which nine were sold, and the IBM 7950 Harvest computer for the National Security Agency. Subsequently, he became manager for developing the IBM System/360 family of computers and the OS/360 software package. During this time he coined the term &quot;computer architecture&quot;.

In 1964, Brooks accepted an invitation to come to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and founded the university&#x27;s computer science department. He chaired it for 20 years. he was still engaged in active research there, mainly in virtual environments and scientific visualization. The Brooks Computer Science Building on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus is named in his honor.

A few years after leaving IBM, he wrote &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;. The seed for the book was planted by IBM&#x27;s then-CEO Thomas J. Watson Jr., who asked in Brooks&#x27;s exit interview why it was so much harder to manage software projects than hardware projects. In this book, Brooks made the now-famous statement: &quot;Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later&quot;, which has since come to be known as Brooks&#x27;s law. In addition to &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;, Brooks is also known for the paper &quot;No Silver Bullet – Essence and Accident in Software Engineering&quot;.

In 2004 in a talk at the Computer History Museum and also in a 2010 interview in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, Brooks was asked &quot;What do you consider your greatest technological achievement?&quot; Brooks responded, &quot;The most important single decision I ever made was to change the IBM 360 series from a 6-bit byte to an 8-bit byte, thereby enabling the use of lowercase letters. That change propagated everywhere.&quot;

A &quot;20th anniversary&quot; edition of &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot; with four additional chapters was published in 1995.

As well as &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;, Brooks has authored or co-authored many books and peer reviewed papers including &quot;Automatic Data Processing&quot;, &quot;No Silver Bullet&quot;, &quot;Computer Architecture&quot;, and &quot;The Design of Design&quot;.

His contributions to human–computer interaction are described in Ben Shneiderman&#x27;s HCI pioneers website.

<text>A factoid is either a false statement presented as a fact, &quot;or&quot; a true but brief or trivial item of news or information.

The term was coined in 1973 by American writer Norman Mailer to mean a piece of information that becomes accepted as a fact even though it is not actually true, or an invented fact believed to be true because it appears in print. Since the term&#x27;s invention in 1973, it has become used to describe a brief or trivial item of news or information.

==Usage==
The term was coined by American writer Norman Mailer in his 1973 biography of Marilyn Monroe. Mailer described factoids as &quot;facts which have no existence before appearing in a magazine or newspaper&quot;, and formed the word by combining the word &quot;fact&quot; and the ending &quot;-oid&quot; to mean &quot;similar but not the same&quot;. &quot;The Washington Times&quot; described Mailer&#x27;s new word as referring to &quot;something that looks like a fact, could be a fact, but in fact is not a fact&quot;.

Accordingly, factoids may give rise to, or arise from, common misconceptions and urban legends. Several decades after the term was coined by Mailer, it came to have several meanings, some of which are quite distinct from each other. In 1993, William Safire identified several contrasting senses of &quot;factoid&quot;:

* &quot;factoid: accusatory: misinformation purporting to be factual; or, a phony statistic.&quot;
* &quot;factoid: neutral: seemingly though not necessarily factual&quot;
* &quot;factoid: (the CNN version): a little-known bit of information; trivial but interesting data.&quot;

This new sense of a factoid as a trivial but interesting fact was popularized by the CNN Headline News TV channel, which, during the 1980s and 1990s, often included such a fact under the heading &quot;factoid&quot; during newscasts. BBC Radio 2 presenter Steve Wright used factoids extensively on his show.

==Versus factlet==
As a result of confusion over the meaning of factoid, some English-language style and usage guides discourage its use. William Safire in his &quot;On Language&quot; column advocated the use of the word &quot;factlet&quot; instead of &quot;factoid&quot; to express a brief interesting fact as well as a &quot;little bit of arcana&quot; but did not explain how adopting this new term would alleviate the ongoing confusion over the existing contradictory common use meanings of &quot;factoid&quot;.

Safire suggested that &quot;factlet&quot; be used to designate a small or trivial bit of information that is nonetheless true or accurate. A report in &quot;The Guardian&quot; identified Safire as the writer who coined the term &quot;factlet&quot;, although Safire&#x27;s 1993 column suggested &quot;factlet&quot; was already in use at that time. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine agreed with Safire and recommended &quot;factlet&quot; to signify a &quot;small probably unimportant but interesting fact&quot;, as &quot;factoid&quot; still connoted a spurious fact. The term &quot;factlet&quot; has been used in publications such as &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;, and in the &quot;Reno Gazette Journal&quot;.

<text>Figured bass is musical notation in which numerals and symbols appear above or below (or next to) a bass note. The numerals and symbols (often accidentals) indicate intervals, chords, and non-chord tones that a musician playing piano, harpsichord, organ, or lute (or other instruments capable of playing chords) should play in relation to the bass note. Figured bass is closely associated with basso continuo: a historically improvised accompaniment used in almost all genres of music in the Baroque period of Classical music ( 1600–1750), though rarely in modern music. Figured bass is also known as thoroughbass.

Other systems for denoting or representing chords include plain staff notation, used in classical music; Roman numerals, commonly used in harmonic analysis; chord letters, sometimes used in modern musicology; the Nashville Number System; and various chord names and symbols used in jazz and popular music (e.g., C Major or simply C; D minor, Dm, or D−; G7, etc.).

==Basso continuo==
Basso continuo parts, most common in the Baroque era (1600–1750), provided the harmonic structure of the music by supplying a bassline and a chord progression. The phrase is often shortened to &quot;continuo&quot;, and the instrumentalists playing the continuo part are called the &quot;continuo group&quot;.

The makeup of the continuo group is often left to the discretion of the performers (or, for a larger performance, the conductor), and practice varied enormously within the Baroque period. At least one instrument capable of playing chords must be included, such as a piano, harpsichord, organ, lute, theorbo, guitar, regal, or harp. In addition, any number of instruments that play in the bass register may be included, such as cello, double bass, bass viol, or bassoon. The most common combination, at least in modern performances, is harpsichord and cello for instrumental works and secular vocal works, such as operas, and organ and cello for sacred music. A double bass may be added, particularly when accompanying a lower-pitched solo voice (e.g., a bass singer).

Typically performers match the instrument families used in the full ensemble: including bassoon when the work includes oboes or other winds, but restricting it to cello and/or double bass if only strings are involved. Harps, lutes, and other handheld instruments are more typical of early 17th-century music. Sometimes instruments are specified by the composer: in &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; (1607) Monteverdi calls for an exceptionally varied instrumentation, with multiple harpsichords and lutes with a bass violin in the pastoral scenes followed by lamenting to the accompaniment of &quot;organo di legno&quot; and &quot;chitarrone&quot;, while Charon stands watch to the sound of a regal.

The keyboard (or other chord-playing instrument) player &quot;realizes&quot; (adds in an improvised fashion) a continuo part by playing, in addition to the notated bass line, notes above it to complete chords, either determined ahead of time or improvised in performance. The figured bass notation, described below, is a guide, but performers are also expected to use their musical judgment and the other instruments or voices (notably the lead melody and any accidentals that might be present in it) as a guide. Experienced players sometimes incorporate motives found in the other instrumental parts into their improvised chordal accompaniment. Modern editions of such music usually supply a realized keyboard part, fully written out in staff notation for a player, in place of improvisation. With the rise in historically informed performance, however, the number of performers who are able to improvise their parts from the figures, as Baroque players would have done, has increased.

Basso continuo, though an essential structural and identifying element of the Baroque period, rapidly declined in the classical period (up to around 1800). A late example is C. P. E. Bach&#x27;s Concerto in D minor for flute, strings and basso continuo (1747). Examples of its use in the 19th century are rarer, but they do exist: masses by Anton Bruckner, Beethoven, and Franz Schubert, for example, have a basso continuo part that was for an organist.

==Figured bass notation==
A part notated with figured bass consists of a bass line notated with notes on a musical staff plus added numbers and accidentals (or in some cases (back)slashes added to a number) beneath the staff to indicate what intervals above the bass notes should be played, and therefore which inversions of which chords are to be played.

The phrase &quot;tasto solo&quot; indicates that only the bass line (without any upper chords) is to be played for a short period, usually until the next figure is encountered. This instructs the chord-playing instrumentalist not to play any improvised chords for a period. The reason &quot;tasto solo&quot; had to be specified was because it was an accepted convention that if no figures were present in a section of otherwise figured bass line, the chord-playing performer would either assume that it was a root-position triad, or deduce from the harmonic motion that another figure was implied. For example, if a continuo part in the key of C begins with a C bass note in the first measure, which descends to a B in the second measure, even if there were no figures, the chord-playing instrumentalist would deduce that this was most likely a first inversion dominant chord (spelled B–D–G, from bottom note of the chord to the top).

Composers were inconsistent in the usages described below. Especially in the 17th century, the numbers were omitted whenever the composer thought the chord was obvious. Early composers such as Claudio Monteverdi often specified the octave by the use of compound intervals such as 10, 11, and 15.

===Numbers===

Contemporary figured bass abbreviations for triads and seventh chords are shown in the table to the right.

The numbers indicate the number of scale steps above the given bass-line that a note should be played. For example:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \time 6/4 \clef bass « { c1 } \figures { &lt; 6 4 &gt;1 } » }&lt;/score&gt;

Here, the bass note is a C, and the numbers 4 and 6 indicate that notes a fourth and a sixth above it should be played, that is an F and an A. In other words, the second inversion of an F major chord can be realized as:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \time 6/4 \clef bass « { &lt;a f c&gt;1 } » }&lt;/score&gt;

In cases where the numbers 3 or 5 would normally be understood, these are usually left out. For example:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \clef bass « { \cadenzaOn c1 b, g, } \figures { &lt; _ &gt;1 &lt; 6 &gt; &lt; 7 &gt; } » }&lt;/score&gt;

has the same meaning as

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \clef bass « { \cadenzaOn c1 b, g, } \figures { &lt; 5 3 &gt;1 &lt; 6 3 &gt; &lt; 7 5 3 &gt; } » }&lt;/score&gt;

and can be realized as

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \clef bass \cadenzaOn &lt;c e g&gt;1 &lt;g, b, d f&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

although the performer may choose which octave to play the notes in and will often elaborate them in some way, such as by playing them as arpeggios rather than as block chords, or by adding improvised ornaments, depending on the tempo and texture of the music.

Sometimes, other numbers are omitted: a 2 on its own or indicates , for example. From the figured bass-writer&#x27;s perspective, this bass note is obviously a third inversion seventh chord, so the sixth interval is viewed as an interval that the player should automatically infer. In many cases entire figures can be left out, usually where the chord is obvious from the progression or the melody.

Sometimes the chord changes but the bass note itself is held. In these cases the figures for the new chord are written wherever in the bar they are meant to occur.

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \time 6/4 « { a&#x27;2 g&#x27; } \new Staff { \clef bass { c1 } } \figures { &lt; 6 &gt;2 &lt; 5 &gt; } » }&lt;/score&gt; can be realized as &lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \time 6/4 « { a&#x27;2 g&#x27; } \new Staff { \clef bass « { &lt;a e&gt;2 &lt;c&#x27; e&gt; } \\ { c1 } » } » }&lt;/score&gt;

When the bass note changes but the notes in the chord above it are to be held, a line is drawn next to the figure or figures, for as long as the chord is to be held, to indicate this:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \time 6/4 \clef bass « { c2 b, } \figures { \bassFigureExtendersOn &lt; 6 &gt;2 &lt; 6&gt; } » }&lt;/score&gt; can be realized as &lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \time 6/4 \clef bass « { &lt;e a&gt;1 } \\ { c2 b, } » }&lt;/score&gt;

When the bass moves the chord intervals have effectively changed, in this case from to , but no additional numbers are written.

===Accidentals===

When an accidental is shown on its own without a number, it applies to the note a third above the lowest note; most commonly, this is the third of the chord. Otherwise, if a number is shown, the accidental affects the said interval. For example, this, showing the widespread default meaning of an accidental without number as applying to the third above the bass:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \clef bass « { e1 c } \figures { &lt; _+ &gt;1 &lt; 6- _- &gt; } » }&lt;/score&gt; can be realized as &lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \clef bass &lt;e gis b&gt;1 &lt;c ees aes&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

Sometimes the accidental is placed after the number rather than before it.

Alternatively, a cross placed next to a number indicates that the pitch of that note should be raised (augmented) by a semitone (so that if it is normally a flat it becomes a natural, and if it is normally a natural it becomes a sharp). A different way to indicate this is to draw a backslash through the number itself. The following three notations, therefore, all indicate the same thing:

:&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \key c \minor \clef bass « { c1 c c } \figures { &lt; 6! &gt;1 &lt; 6\+ &gt; &lt;6\\&gt; } » }&lt;/score&gt; can all be realized as &lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \key c \minor \clef bass « { &lt;c ees a&gt;1 } » }&lt;/score&gt;

More rarely, a &quot;forward&quot; slash through a number indicates that a pitch is to be lowered (diminished) by a semitone: 

:&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \key c \minor \clef bass « { c1 c } \figures { &lt; 5- &gt;1 &lt; 5/ &gt; } » }&lt;/score&gt; can both be realized as &lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \key c \minor \clef bass « { &lt;c ees ges&gt;1 } » }&lt;/score&gt;

When sharps or flats are used with key signatures, they may have a slightly different meaning, especially in 17th-century music. A sharp might be used to cancel a flat in the key signature, or vice versa, instead of a natural sign.

===Example in context===

==Contemporary uses==
In the 20th and 21st century, figured bass is also sometimes used by classical musicians as a shorthand way of indicating chords when a composer is sketching out ideas for a new piece or when a music student is analyzing the harmony of a notated piece of music (e.g., a Bach chorale or a Chopin piano prelude). Figured bass is not generally used in modern musical compositions, except for neo-Baroque pieces. 

In the 2000s, outside of professional Baroque ensembles that specialize in the performance practice of the Baroque era, the most common use of figured bass notation is to indicate the inversion in a harmonic analysis or composer&#x27;s sketch context, however, often without the staff notation, using letter note names followed with the figure. For instance, if a piano piece had a C major triad in the right hand (C–E–G), with the bass note a G with the left hand, this would be a second inversion C major chord, which would be written G. If this same C major triad had an E in the bass, it would be a first inversion chord, which would be written E or E (this is different from the jazz notation, where a C means the added sixth chord C–E–G–A, i.e., a C major with an added 6th degree). The symbols can also be used with Roman numerals in analyzing functional harmony, a usage called &quot;figured Roman&quot;; see chord symbol.

A form of figured bass is used in notation of accordion music; another simplified form is used to notate guitar chords.

<text>Fashion is a term used interchangeably to describe the creation of clothing, footwear, accessories, cosmetics, and jewellery of different cultural aesthetics and their mix and match into outfits that depict distinctive ways of dressing (styles and trends) as signifiers of social status, self-expression, and group belonging. As a multifaceted term, fashion describes an industry, styles, aesthetics, and trends.

The term &#x27;fashion&#x27; originates from the Latin word &#x27;Facere,&#x27; which means &#x27;to make,&#x27; and describes the manufacturing, mixing, and wearing of outfits adorned with specific cultural aesthetics, patterns, motifs, shapes, and cuts, allowing people to showcase their group belonging, values, meanings, beliefs, and ways of life. Given the rise in mass production of commodities and clothing at lower prices and global reach, reducing fashion&#x27;s environmental impact and improving sustainability has become an urgent issue among politicians, brands, and consumers.

== Definitions ==
The French word , meaning &quot;fashion&quot;, dates as far back as 1482, while the English word denoting something &quot;in style&quot; dates only to the 16th century. Other words exist related to concepts of style and appeal that precede &quot;mode&quot;. In the 12th and 13th century Old French the concept of elegance begins to appear in the context of aristocratic preferences to enhance beauty and display refinement, and , the idea of making oneself more attractive to others by style or artifice in grooming and dress, appears in a 13th-century poem by Guillaume de Lorris advising men that &quot;handsome clothes and handsome accessories improve a man a great deal&quot;.

Fashion scholar Susan B. Kaiser states that everyone is &quot;forced to appear&quot;, unmediated before others. Everyone is evaluated by their attire, and evaluation includes the consideration of colors, materials, silhouette, and how garments appear on the body. Garments identical in style and material also appear different depending on the wearer&#x27;s body shape, or whether the garment has been washed, folded, mended, or is new.

&quot;Fashion&quot; is defined in a number of different ways, and its application can be sometimes unclear. Though the term &quot;fashion&quot; connotes difference, as in &quot;the new fashions of the season&quot;, it can also connote sameness, for example in reference to &quot;the fashions of the 1960s&quot;, implying a general uniformity. Fashion can signify the latest trends, but may often reference fashions of a previous era, leading to the reappearance of fashions from a different time period. While what is fashionable can be defined by a relatively insular, esteemed and often rich aesthetic elite who make a look exclusive, such as fashion houses and haute couturiers, this &#x27;look&#x27; is often designed by pulling references from subcultures and social groups who are not considered elite, and are thus excluded from making the distinction of what is fashion themselves.

Whereas a &quot;trend&quot; often connotes a peculiar aesthetic expression, often lasting shorter than a season and being identifiable by visual extremes, fashion is a distinctive and industry-supported expression traditionally tied to the fashion season and collections. &quot;Style&quot; is an expression that lasts over many seasons and is often connected to cultural movements and social markers, symbols, class, and culture (such as Baroque and Rococo). According to sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, fashion connotes &quot;the latest difference.&quot;

Even though the terms &quot;fashion&quot;, &quot;clothing&quot; and &quot;costume&quot; are often used together, fashion differs from both. &quot;Clothing&quot; describes the material and the technical garment, devoid of any social meaning or connections; &quot;costume&quot; has come to mean fancy dress or masquerade wear. Fashion, by contrast, describes the social and temporal system that influences and &quot;activates&quot; dress as a social signifier in a certain time and context. Philosopher Giorgio Agamben connects fashion to the qualitative Ancient Greek concept of , meaning &quot;the right, critical, or opportune moment&quot;, and clothing to the quantitative concept of , the personification of chronological or sequential time.

While some exclusive brands may claim the label &quot;haute couture,&quot; in France, the term is technically limited to members of the in Paris. Haute couture is more aspirational; inspired by art and culture, and in most cases, reserved for the economic elite. However, New York&#x27;s fashion calendar hosts Couture Fashion Week, which strives for a more equitable and inclusive mission.

Fashion is also a source of art, allowing people to display their unique tastes, sensibilities, and styles. Different fashion designers are influenced by outside stimuli and reflect this inspiration in their work. For example, Gucci&#x27;s &#x27;stained green&#x27; jeans may look like a grass stain, but to others, they display purity, freshness, and summer.

Fashion is unique, self-fulfilling and may be a key part of someone&#x27;s identity. Similarly to art, the aims of a person&#x27;s choices in fashion are not necessarily to be liked by everyone, but instead to be an expression of personal taste. A person&#x27;s personal style functions as a &quot;societal formation always combining two opposite principles. It is a socially acceptable and secure way to distinguish oneself from others and, at the same time, it satisfies the individual&#x27;s need for social adaptation and imitation.&quot; While philosopher Immanuel Kant believed that fashion &quot;has nothing to do with genuine judgements of taste&quot;, and was instead &quot;a case of unreflected and &#x27;blind&#x27; imitation&quot;, sociologist Georg Simmel thought of fashion as something that &quot;helped overcome the distance between an individual and his society&quot;. American sociologist Diana Crane also mentioned in her book that fashion is closely intertwined with personal and group identity, serving as a means of expressing cultural, social, and political affiliations.

==History of fashion==
Changes in clothing often took place at times of economic or social change, as occurred in ancient Rome and the medieval Caliphate, followed by a long period without significant changes. In eighth-century Moorish Spain, the musician Ziryab introduced to Córdoba sophisticated clothing styles based on seasonal and daily fashions from his native Baghdad, modified by his inspiration. Similar changes in fashion occurred in the 11th century in the Middle East following the arrival of the Turks, who introduced clothing styles from Central Asia and the Far East.

=== Alleged Western distinctiveness ===
Early Western travellers who visited India, Persia, Turkey, or China, would frequently remark on the absence of change in fashion in those countries. In 1609, the secretary of the Japanese bragged inaccurately to a Spanish visitor that Japanese clothing had not changed in over a thousand years. However, these conceptions of non-Western clothing undergoing little, if any, evolution are generally held to be untrue; for instance, there is considerable evidence in Ming China of rapidly changing fashions in Chinese clothing. In imperial China, clothing were not only an embodiment of freedom and comfort or used to cover the body or protect against the cold or used for decorative purposes; it was also regulated by strong sumptuary laws which was based on strict social hierarchy system and the ritual system of the Chinese society. It was expected for people to be dressed accordingly to their gender, social status and occupation; the Chinese clothing system had cleared evolution and varied in appearance in each period of history. However, ancient Chinese fashion, like in other cultures, was an indicator of the socioeconomic conditions of its population; for Confucian scholars, however, changing fashion was often associated with social disorder which was brought by rapid commercialization. Clothing which experienced fast changing fashion in ancient China was recorded in ancient Chinese texts, where it was sometimes referred as , &quot;contemporary-styles&quot;, and was associated with the concept of , &quot;outrageous dress&quot;, which typically holds a negative connotation. Similar changes in clothing can be seen in Japanese clothing between the Genroku period and the later centuries of the Edo period (1603–1867), during which a time clothing trends switched from flashy and expensive displays of wealth to subdued and subverted ones.

The myth on the lack of fashion in what was considered the Orient was related to Western Imperialism also often accompanied Orientalism, and European imperialism was especially at its highest in the 19th century. In the 19th century time, Europeans described China in binary opposition to Europe, describing China as &quot;lacking in fashion&quot; among many other things, while Europeans deliberately placed themselves in a superior position when they would compare themselves to the Chinese as well as to other countries in Asia:Similar ideas were also applied to other countries in the East Asia, in India, and Middle East, where the perceived lack of fashion were associated with offensive remarks on the Asian social and political systems:

=== Africa ===
Additionally, there is a long history of fashion in West Africa. Cloth was used as a form of currency in trade with the Portuguese and Dutch as early as the 16th century, and locally produced cloth and cheaper European imports were assembled into new styles to accommodate the growing elite class of West Africans and resident gold and slave traders. There was an exceptionally strong tradition of weaving in the Oyo Empire, and the areas inhabited by the Igbo people.

=== Fashion in the Western world ===
The beginning in Europe of continual and accelerating change in clothing styles can be fairly reliably dated to late medieval times. Historians, including James Laver and Fernand Braudel, date the start of Western fashion in clothing to the middle of the 14th century, though they tend to rely heavily on contemporary imagery, as illuminated manuscripts were not common before the 14th century. The most dramatic early change in fashion was a sudden drastic shortening and tightening of the male over-garment from calf-length to barely covering the buttocks, sometimes accompanied with stuffing in the chest to make it look bigger. This created the distinctive Western outline of a tailored top worn over leggings or trousers.

The pace of change accelerated considerably in the following century, and women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s fashion, especially in the dressing and adorning of the hair, became equally complex. Art historians are, therefore, able to use fashion with confidence and precision to date images, often to within five years, particularly in the case of images from the 15th century. Initially, changes in fashion led to a fragmentation across the upper classes of Europe of what had previously been a very similar style of dressing and the subsequent development of distinctive national styles. These national styles remained very different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries imposed similar styles once again, mostly originating from Ancien Régime France. Though the rich usually led fashion, the increasing affluence of early modern Europe led to the bourgeoisie and even peasants following trends at a distance, but still uncomfortably close for the elites – a factor that Fernand Braudel regards as one of the main motors of changing fashion.

In the 16th century, national differences were at their most pronounced. Ten 16th century portraits of German or Italian gentlemen may show ten entirely different hats. Albrecht Dürer illustrated the differences in his actual (or composite) contrast of Nuremberg and Venetian fashions at the close of the 15th century (illustration, right). The &quot;Spanish style&quot; of the late 16th century began the move back to synchronicity among upper-class Europeans, and after a struggle in the mid-17th century, French styles decisively took over leadership, a process completed in the 18th century.

Though different textile colors and patterns changed from year to year, the cut of a gentleman&#x27;s coat and the length of his waistcoat, or the pattern to which a lady&#x27;s dress was cut, changed more slowly. Men&#x27;s fashions were primarily derived from military models, and changes in a European male silhouette were galvanized in theaters of European war where gentleman officers had opportunities to make notes of different styles such as the &quot;Steinkirk&quot; cravat or necktie. Both parties wore shirts under their clothing, the cut and style of which had little cause to change over a number of centuries.

Though there had been distribution of dressed dolls from France since the 16th century and Abraham Bosse had produced engravings of fashion in the 1620s, the pace of change picked up in the 1780s with increased publication of French engravings illustrating the latest Paris styles. By 1800, all Western Europeans were dressing alike (or thought they were); local variation became first a sign of provincial culture and later a badge of the conservative peasant.

Although tailors and dressmakers were no doubt responsible for many innovations, and the textile industry indeed led many trends, the history of fashion design is generally understood to date from 1858 when the English-born Charles Frederick Worth opened the first authentic &quot;haute couture&quot; house in Paris. The Haute house was the name established by the government for the fashion houses that met the standards of the industry. These fashion houses continue to adhere to standards such as keeping at least twenty employees engaged in making the clothes, showing two collections per year at fashion shows, and presenting a certain number of patterns to costumers. Since then, the idea of the fashion designer as a celebrity in their own right has become increasingly dominant.

Although fashion can be feminine or masculine, additional trends are androgynous. The idea of unisex dressing originated in the 1960s, when designers such as Pierre Cardin and Rudi Gernreich created garments, such as stretch jersey tunics or leggings, meant to be worn by both males and females. The impact of unisex wearability expanded more broadly to encompass various themes in fashion, including androgyny, mass-market retail, and conceptual clothing. The fashion trends of the 1970s, such as sheepskin jackets, flight jackets, duffel coats, and unstructured clothing, influenced men to attend social gatherings without a dinner jacket and to accessorize in new ways. Some men&#x27;s styles blended the sensuality and expressiveness, and the growing gay-rights movement and an emphasis on youth allowed for a new freedom to experiment with style and with fabrics such as wool crepe, which had previously been associated with women&#x27;s attire.

The four major current fashion capitals are acknowledged to be New York City (Manhattan), Paris, Milan, and London, which are all headquarters to the most significant fashion companies and are renowned for their major influence on global fashion. Fashion weeks are held in these cities, where designers exhibit their new clothing collections to audiences. A study demonstrated that general proximity to New York&#x27;s Garment District was important to participate in the American fashion ecosystem. &quot;Haute couture&quot; has now largely been subsidized by the sale of ready-to-wear collections and perfume using the same branding.

Modern Westerners have a vast number of choices in the selection of their clothes. What a person chooses to wear can reflect their personality or interests. When people who have high cultural status start to wear new or different styles, they may inspire a new fashion trend. People who like or respect these people are influenced by their style and begin wearing similarly styled clothes.

Fashions may vary considerably within a society according to age, social class, generation, occupation, and geography, and may also vary over time. The terms &quot;fashionista&quot; and &quot;fashion victim&quot; refer to someone who slavishly follows current fashions.

===Asia===

In the early 2000s, Asian fashion influences became increasingly significant in local and global markets. Countries such as China, Japan, India, and Pakistan have traditionally had large textile industries with a number of rich traditions; though these were often drawn upon by Western designers, Asian clothing styles gained considerable influence in the early- to mid-2000s.

China

Chinese fashion remained constantly changing over the centuries. In China, throughout the Tang Dynasty (618–907), women wore extravagant attire to demonstrate prosperity. Mongol men of the Yuan Dynasty (1279–1368) wore loose robes; horsemen sported shorter robes, trousers, and boots to provide ease when horseback riding. The leaders of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911) maintained Manchu dress, while establishing new garments for officials; while foot binding—originally introduced in the 10th century—was not preserved, women of this era were expected to wear particular heels that pushed them to take on a ladylike walk.

Then, in the 1920s, qipao was in vogue and the style consisted of stand collars, trumpet sleeves, straight silhouettes and short side slits. Since then, designers started to move into Western fashion like fur coats and cloaks and body-hugging dresses with long side slits as qipao became more popular. In the 1950s and 60s, ‘Lenin coats’ with double lines of buttons, slanting pockets and a belt came into vogue among Chinese men.

India

In India, it has been common for followers of different religions to wear corresponding pieces of clothing. During the 15th century, Muslim and Hindu women wore notably different articles of clothing. This is also seen in many other Eastern world countries.

In the Victorian era, most women did not wear blouses under their saris, which did not suit the Victorian society; however, British and Indian fashion would be influenced by each other in following decades. In the 1920s, the nationalists adopted Khadi cloth as a symbol of resistance; here, Gandhi became the face of the resistance which made people spin, weave, and wear their Khadi. Today, the salwaar-kameez is recognized as the national dress of India.

Japan

For Japan, the people during the Meiji period (1868–1912) widely incorporated Western styles into Japanese fashion, which is considered to be a remarkable transformation for the Japanese vogue. They extensively adopted the style and practices of Western cultures.The upper classes wore more extravagant pieces of clothing like luxurious patterned silks and adorned themselves with fancy sashes. Women also started wearing Western dresses in public instead of their traditional Kimono. Most of the officials were also required to wear Western suits. In this way, the Japanese slowly adopted into Western fashion. Moreover, like India, different Japanese religions wear different pieces of clothing.

==Fashion industry==


In its most common use, the term fashion refers to the current expressions on sale through the fashion industry. The global fashion industry is a product of the modern age. In the Western world, tailoring has since medieval times been controlled by guilds, but with the emergence of industrialism, the power of the guilds was undermined. Before the mid-19th century, most clothing was custom-made. It was handmade for individuals, either as home production or on order from dressmakers and tailors. By the beginning of the 20th century, with the rise of new technologies such as the sewing machine, the rise of global trade, the development of the factory system of production, and the proliferation of retail outlets such as department stores, clothing became increasingly mass-produced in standard sizes and sold at fixed prices.

Although the fashion industry developed first in Europe and America, , it is an international and highly globalized industry, with clothing often designed in one country, manufactured in another, and sold worldwide. For example, an American fashion company might source fabric in China and have the clothes manufactured in Vietnam, finished in Italy, and shipped to a warehouse in the United States for distribution to retail outlets internationally.

The fashion industry has for a long time been one of the largest employers in the United States, and it remains so in the 21st century. However, U.S. employment in fashion began to decline considerably as production increasingly moved overseas, especially to China. Because data regarding the fashion industry typically are reported for national economies and expressed in terms of the industry&#x27;s many separate sectors, aggregate figures for the world production of textiles and clothing are difficult to obtain. However, by any measure, the clothing industry accounts for a significant share of world economic output.
The fashion industry consists of four levels:

# The production of raw materials, principally fiber, and textiles but also leather and fur.
# The production of fashion goods by designers, manufacturers, contractors, and others.
# Retail sales.
# Various forms of advertising and promotion.

The levels of focus in the fashion industry consist of many separate but interdependent sectors. These sectors include textile design and production, fashion design and manufacturing, fashion retailing, marketing and merchandising, fashion shows, and media and marketing. Each sector is devoted to the goal of satisfying consumer demand for apparel under conditions that enable participants in the industry to operate at a profit.

== Fashion trends ==


A fashion trend signifies a specific look or expression that is spread across a population at a specific time and place. A trend is considered a more ephemeral look, not defined by the seasons when collections are released by the fashion industry. A trend can thus emerge from street style, across cultures, and from influencers and other celebrities.

Fashion trends are influenced by several factors, including cinema, celebrities, climate, creative explorations, innovations, designs, political, economic, social, and technological. Examining these factors is called a PEST analysis. Fashion forecasters can use this information to help determine the growth or decline of a particular trend.

People&#x27;s minds as well as their perceptions and consciousness are constantly changing. Fads are inherently social, are constantly evolving in a contradiction between the old and the new, and are in a sense easily influenced by those around them, and therefore also begin to imitate constantly.

Continuing on from the maximalist and 1980s influences of the early 2020s, vibrant coloured clothing had made a comeback for women in America, France, China, Korea, and Ukraine by the spring of 2023. This style, sometimes referred to as &quot;dopamine dressing&quot;, featured long skirts and belted maxi dresses with thigh splits, lots of gold and pearl jewelry, oversized striped cardigan sweaters, multicoloured silk skirts with seashell or floral print, strappy sandals, pants with a contrasting stripe down the leg, ugg boots, floral print maxi skirts, Y2K inspired platform shoes, chunky red rain boots, shimmery jumpsuits, knitted dresses, leather pilot jackets with faux fur collars, skirts with bold contrasting vertical stripes, trouser suits with bootcut legs, jeans with glittery heart or star-shaped details, chunky white or black sandals, and zebra print tote bags.

Big, oversized garments were often made from translucent materials and featured cutouts intended to expose the wearer&#x27;s bare shoulder, thigh, or midriff, such as low-cut waists on the pants or tops with strappy necklines intended to be worn braless. Desirable colours included neon green, watermelon green, coral pink, orange, salmon pink, magenta, gold, electric blue, aquamarine, cyan, turquoise, and royal blue.

In 2023, the predominant colours in Britain, France and America were red, white and blue. As in the mid to late 1970s, Western shirts with pearl snaps in denim or bright madras plaid made a comeback, and sometimes featured contrasting yokes and cuffs with intricate embroidery. Moccasins, stonewash denim waistcoats with decorative fringes, preppy loafers, navy blue suits and sportcoats, straight leg jeans instead of the skinny jeans fashionable from the late 2000s until the early 2020s, stetsons, white baseball jerseys with bold red or blue pinstripes, striped blue neckties, baggy white pants, Union Jack motifs, flared jeans, duster coats as worn in the &quot;Yellowstone&quot; TV series, preppy style college sweaters, retro blue and white striped football shirts, chelsea boots with cowboy boot styling, two-button blazers with red and blue boating stripes, V-neck sweater vests, royal blue baseball jackets with white sleeves, Howler Brothers gilets, shirts and suits worn open to expose the chest, and boxy leather reefer jackets were popular on both sides of the Atlantic.

=== Social influences ===

Fashion is inherently a social phenomenon. A person cannot have a fashion by oneself, but for something to be defined as fashion, there needs to be dissemination and followers. This dissemination can take several forms; from the top-down (&quot;trickle-down&quot;) to bottom-up (&quot;bubble up/trickle-up&quot;), or transversally across cultures and through viral memes and media (&quot;trickle-across&quot;).

Fashion relates to the social and cultural context of an environment. According to Matika, &quot;Elements of popular culture become fused when a person&#x27;s trend is associated with a preference for a genre of music […] like music, news, or literature, fashion has been fused into everyday lives.&quot; Fashion is not only seen as purely aesthetic; fashion is also a medium for people to create an overall effect and express their opinions and overall art.

This mirrors what performers frequently accomplish through music videos. In the music video &#x27;Formation&#x27; by Beyoncé, according to Carlos,
The annual or seasonal runway show is a reflection of fashion trends and a designer&#x27;s inspirations. For designers like Vivienne Westwood, runway shows are a platform for her voice on politics and current events. For her AW15 menswear show, according to Water, &quot;where models with severely bruised faces channeled eco-warriors on a mission to save the planet.&quot; Another recent example is a staged feminist protest march for Chanel&#x27;s SS15 show, rioting models chanting words of empowerment using signs like &quot;Feminist but feminine&quot; and &quot;Ladies first.&quot; According to Water, &quot;The show tapped into Chanel&#x27;s long history of championing female independence: founder Coco Chanel was a trailblazer for liberating the female body in the post-WWI era, introducing silhouettes that countered the restrictive corsets then in favour.&quot;

The annual Met Gala ceremony in Manhattan is the premier venue where fashion designers and their creations are celebrated. Social media is also a place where fashion is presented most often. Some influencers are paid huge amounts of money to promote a product or clothing item, where the business hopes many viewers will buy the product off the back of the advertisement. Instagram is the most popular platform for advertising, but Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and other platforms are also used. In New York, the LGBT fashion design community contributes very significantly to promulgating fashion trends, and drag celebrities have developed a profound influence upon New York Fashion Week.

=== Marketing ===

====Market research====

Consumers of different groups have varying needs and demands. Factors taken into consideration when analyzing consumers&#x27; needs include key demographics.
To understand consumers&#x27; needs and predict fashion trends, fashion companies have to do market research There are two research methods: primary and secondary. Secondary methods are taking other information that has already been collected, for example using a book or an article for research. Primary research is collecting data through surveys, interviews, observation, and/or focus groups. Primary research often focuses on large sample sizes to determine customer&#x27;s motivations to shop.
The benefits of primary research are specific information about a fashion brand&#x27;s consumer is explored. Surveys are helpful tools; questions can be open-ended or closed-ended. Negative factor surveys and interviews present is that the answers can be biased, due to wording in the survey or on face-to-face interactions. Focus groups, about 8 to 12 people, can be beneficial because several points can be addressed in depth. However, there are drawbacks to this tactic, too. With such a small sample size, it is hard to know if the greater public would react the same way as the focus group. Observation can really help a company gain insight on what a consumer truly wants. There is less of a bias because consumers are just performing their daily tasks, not necessarily realizing they are being observed. For example, observing the public by taking street style photos of people, the consumer did not get dressed in the morning knowing that would have their photo taken necessarily. They just wear what they would normally wear. Through observation patterns can be seen, helping trend forecasters know what their target market needs and wants.

Knowing the needs of consumers will increase fashion companies&#x27; sales and profits. Through research and studying the consumers&#x27; lives the needs of the customer can be obtained and help fashion brands know what trends the consumers are ready for.

====Symbolic consumption====
Consumption is driven not only by need, the symbolic meaning for consumers is also a factor. Consumers engaging in symbolic consumption may develop a sense of self over an extended period of time as various objects are collected as part of the process of establishing their identity and, when the symbolic meaning is shared in a social group, to communicate their identity to others. For teenagers, consumption plays a role in distinguishing the child self from the adult. Researchers have found that the fashion choices of teenagers are used for self-expression and also to recognize other teens who wear similar clothes. The symbolic association of clothing items can link individuals&#x27; personality and interests, with music as a prominent factor influencing fashion decisions.

=== Political influences ===
Political figures have played a central role in the development of fashion, at least since the time of French king Louis XIV. For example, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was a fashion icon of the early 1960s. Wearing Chanel suits, structural Givenchy shift dresses, and soft color Cassini coats with large buttons, she inspired trends of both elegant formal dressing and classic feminine style.

Cultural upheavals have also had an impact on fashion trends. For example, during the 1960s, the U.S. economy was robust, the divorce rate was increasing, and the government approved the birth control pill. These factors inspired the younger generation to rebel against entrenched social norms. The civil rights movement, a struggle for social justice and equal opportunity for Blacks, and the women&#x27;s liberation movement, seeking equal rights and opportunities and greater personal freedom for women, were in full bloom. In 1964, the leg-baring mini-skirt was introduced and became a white-hot trend. Fashion designers then began to experiment with the shapes of garments: loose sleeveless dresses, micro-minis, flared skirts, and trumpet sleeves. Fluorescent colors, print patterns, bell-bottom jeans, fringed vests, and skirts became &quot;de rigueur&quot; outfits of the 1960s.

Concern and protest over U.S. involvement in the failing Vietnam War also influenced fashion. Camouflage patterns in military clothing, developed to help military personnel be less visible to enemy forces, seeped into streetwear designs in the 1960s. Camouflage trends have disappeared and resurfaced several times since then, appearing in high fashion iterations in the 1990s. Designers such as Valentino, Dior, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana combined camouflage into their runway and ready-to-wear collections. Today, variations of camouflage, including pastel shades, in every article of clothing or accessory, continue to enjoy popularity.

=== Technology influences ===

Today, technology plays a sizable role in society, and technological influences are correspondingly increasing within the realm of fashion. Wearable technology has become incorporated; for example, clothing constructed with solar panels that charge devices and smart fabrics that enhance wearer comfort by changing color or texture based on environmental changes. 3D printing technology has influenced designers such as Iris van Herpen and Kimberly Ovitz. As the technology evolves, 3D printers will become more accessible to designers and eventually, consumers — these could potentially reshape design and production in the fashion industry entirely.

Internet technology, enabling the far reaches of online retailers and social media platforms, has created previously unimaginable ways for trends to be identified, marketed, and sold immediately. Trend-setting styles are easily displayed and communicated online to attract customers. Posts on Instagram or Facebook can quickly increase awareness about new trends in fashion, which subsequently may create high demand for specific items or brands, new &quot;buy now button&quot; technology can link these styles with direct sales.

Machine vision technology has been developed to track how fashions spread through society. The industry can now see the direct correlation on how fashion shows influence street-chic outfits. Effects such as these can now be quantified and provide valuable feedback to fashion houses, designers, and consumers regarding trends.

== Environmental impact ==
==Media==
Media, including social media platforms, play a crucial role in shaping fashion trends, creating a rapid cycle of trend adoption and obsolescence. For instance, an important part of fashion is fashion journalism. Editorial critique, guidelines, and commentary can be found on television and in magazines, newspapers, fashion websites, social networks, and fashion blogs. In recent years, fashion blogging and YouTube videos have become a major outlet for spreading trends and fashion tips, creating an online culture of sharing one&#x27;s style on a website or social media accounts (i.e. Instagram, TikTok, or Twitter). Through these media outlets, readers and viewers all over the world can learn about fashion, making it very accessible. In addition to fashion journalism, another media platform that is important in fashion industry is advertisement. Advertisements provide information to audiences and promote the sales of products and services. The fashion industry uses advertisements to attract consumers and promote its products to generate sales. A few decades ago when technology was still underdeveloped, advertisements heavily relied on radio, magazines, billboards, and newspapers. These days, there are more various ways in advertisements such as television ads, online-based ads using internet websites, and posts, videos, and live streaming in social media platforms.

=== Fashion in printed media ===

There are two subsets of print styling: editorial and lifestyle. Editorial styling is the high-fashion styling seen in fashion magazines, and this tends to be more artistic and fashion-forward. Lifestyle styling focuses on a more overtly commercial goal, like a department store advertisement, a website, or an advertisement where fashion is not what&#x27;s being sold but the models are hired to promote the product in the photo.

The dressing practices of the powerful have traditionally been mediated through art and the practices of the courts. The looks of the French court were disseminated through prints from the 16th century on, but gained cohesive design with the development of a centralized court under King Louis XIV, which produced an identifiable style that took his name. At the beginning of the 20th century, fashion magazines began to include photographs of various fashion designs and became even more influential than in the past. In cities throughout the world these magazines were greatly sought after and had a profound effect on public taste in clothing. Talented illustrators drew exquisite fashion plates for the publications which covered the most recent developments in fashion and beauty. Perhaps the most famous of these magazines was &quot;La Gazette du Bon Ton&quot;, which was founded in 1912 by Lucien Vogel and regularly published until 1925 (with the exception of the war years).

&quot;Vogue&quot;, founded in Manhattan in 1892, has been the longest-lasting and most successful of the hundreds of fashion magazines that have come and gone. Increasing affluence after World War II and, most importantly, the advent of cheap color printing in the 1960s, led to a huge boost in its sales and heavy coverage of fashion in mainstream women&#x27;s magazines, followed by men&#x27;s magazines in the 1990s. One such example of &quot;Vogue&quot;&#x27;s popularity is the younger version, &quot;Teen Vogue&quot;, which covers clothing and trends that are targeted more toward the &quot;fashionista on a budget&quot;. Haute couture designers followed the trend by starting ready-to-wear and perfume lines which are heavily advertised in the magazines and now dwarf their original couture businesses. A recent development within fashion print media is the rise of text-based and critical magazines which aim to prove that fashion is not superficial, by creating a dialogue between fashion academia and the industry. Examples of this development are: &quot;Fashion Theory&quot; (1997), &quot;Fashion Practice: The Journal of Design, Creative Process &amp; the Fashion Industry&quot; (2008), and &quot;Vestoj&quot; (2009).

=== Fashion in television ===
Television coverage began in the 1950s with small fashion features. In the 1960s and 1970s, fashion segments on various entertainment shows became more frequent, and by the 1980s, dedicated fashion shows such as &quot;Fashion Television&quot; started to appear. &quot;FashionTV&quot; was the pioneer in this undertaking and has since grown to become the leader in both Fashion Television and new media channels. The Fashion Industry is beginning to promote their styles through Bloggers on social media&#x27;s. Vogue specified Chiara Ferragni as &quot;blogger of the moment&quot; due to the rises of followers through her Fashion Blog, that became popular.

A few days after the 2010 Fall Fashion Week in New York City came to a close, &quot;The New Islander&quot;&#x27;s Fashion Editor, Genevieve Tax, criticized the fashion industry for running on a seasonal schedule of its own, largely at the expense of real-world consumers. &quot;Because designers release their fall collections in the spring and their spring collections in the fall, fashion magazines such as &quot;Vogue&quot; always and only look forward to the upcoming season, promoting parkas come September while issuing reviews on shorts in January&quot;, she writes. &quot;Savvy shoppers, consequently, have been conditioned to be extremely, perhaps impractically, farsighted with their buying.&quot;

The fashion industry has been the subject of numerous films and television shows, including the reality show &quot;Project Runway&quot; and the drama series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;. Specific fashion brands have been featured in film, not only as product placement opportunities, but as bespoke items that have subsequently led to trends in fashion.

Videos in general have been very useful in promoting the fashion industry. This is evident not only from television shows directly spotlighting the fashion industry, but also movies, events and music videos which showcase fashion statements as well as promote specific brands through product placements.

=== Controversial advertisements in fashion industry ===

==== Racism in fashion advertisements ====
Some fashion advertisements have been accused of racism and led to boycotts from customers. Globally known Swedish fashion brand H&amp;M faced this issue with one of its children&#x27;s wear advertisements in 2018. A Black child wearing a hoodie with the slogan &quot;coolest monkey in the jungle&quot; was featured in the ad. This immediately led to controversy, as &quot;monkey&quot; is commonly used as slur against Black people, and caused many customers to boycott the brand. Many people, including celebrities, posted on social media about their resentments towards H&amp;M and refusal to work with and buy its products. H&amp;M issued a statement saying &quot;we apologise to anyone this may have offended&quot;, though this too received some criticism for appearing insincere.

Another fashion advertisement seen as racist was from GAP, an American worldwide clothing brand. GAP collaborated with Ellen DeGeneres in 2016 for the advertisement. It features four playful young girls, with a tall White girl leaning with her arm on a shorter Black girl&#x27;s head. Upon release, some viewers harshly criticized it, claiming it shows an underlying passive racism. A representative from &quot;The Root&quot; commented that the ad portrays the message that Black people are undervalued and seen as props for White people to look better. Others saw little issue with the ad, and that the controversy was the result of people being oversensitive. GAP replaced the image in the ad and apologized to critics.

==== Sexism in fashion advertisements ====
Many fashion brands have published ads that were provocative and sexy to attract customers&#x27; attention. British high fashion brand, Jimmy Choo, was blamed for having sexism in its ad which featured a female British model wearing the brand&#x27;s boots. In this two-minute ad, men whistle at a model, walking on the street with red, sleeveless mini dress. This ad gained much backlash and criticism by the viewers, as it was seen as promoting sexual harassment and other misconduct. Many people showed their dismay through social media posts, leading Jimmy Choo to pull down the ad from social media platforms.

French luxury fashion brand Yves Saint Laurent also faced this issue with its print ad shown in Paris in 2017. The ad depicted a female model wearing fishnet tights with roller-skate stilettos reclining with her legs opened in front of the camera. This advertisement brought harsh comments from both viewers and French advertising organization directors for going against the advertising codes related to &quot;respect for decency, dignity and those prohibiting submission, violence or dependence, as well as the use of stereotypes.&quot; and additionally said that this ad was causing &quot;mental harm to adolescents.&quot; Due to the negative public reaction, the poster was removed from the city.

==Public relations and social media==
Fashion public relations involves being in touch with a company&#x27;s audiences and creating strong relationships with them, reaching out to media, and initiating messages that project positive images of the company. Social media plays an important role in modern-day fashion public relations; enabling practitioners to reach a wide range of consumers through various platforms.

Building brand awareness and credibility is a key implication of good public relations. In some cases, the hype is built about new designers&#x27; collections before they are released into the market, due to the immense exposure generated by practitioners. Social media, such as blogs, microblogs, podcasts, photo and video sharing sites have all become increasingly important to fashion public relations. The interactive nature of these platforms allows practitioners to engage and communicate with the public in real-time, and tailor their clients&#x27; brand or campaign messages to the target audience. With blogging platforms such as Instagram, Tumblr, WordPress, Squarespace, and other sharing sites, bloggers have emerged as expert fashion commentators, shaping brands and having a great impact on what is &#x27;on trend&#x27;. Women in the fashion public relations industry such as Sweaty Betty PR founder Roxy Jacenko and Oscar de la Renta&#x27;s PR girl Erika Bearman, have acquired copious followers on their social media sites, by providing a brand identity and a behind the scenes look into the companies they work for.

Social media is changing the way practitioners deliver messages, as they are concerned with the media, and also customer relationship building. PR practitioners must provide effective communication among all platforms, in order to engage the fashion public in an industry socially connected via online shopping. Consumers have the ability to share their purchases on their personal social media pages (such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.), and if practitioners deliver the brand message effectively and meet the needs of its public, word-of-mouth publicity will be generated and potentially provide a wide reach for the designer and their products.

==Fashion and political activism==
As fashion concerns people, and signifies social hierarchies, fashion intersects with politics and the social organization of societies. Whereas haute couture and business suits are associated by people in power, also groups aiming to challenge the political order also use clothes to signal their position. The explicit use of fashion as a form of activism, is usually referred to as &quot;fashion activism.&quot;

There is a complex relationship between fashion and feminism. Some feminists have argued that by participating in feminine fashions women are contributing to maintaining the gender differences which are part of women&#x27;s oppression. Brownmiller felt that women should reject traditionally feminine dress, focusing on comfort and practicality rather than fashion. Others believe that it is the fashion system itself that is repressive in requiring women to seasonally change their clothes to keep up with trends. Greer has advocated this argument that seasonal changes in dress should be ignored; she argues that women can be liberated by replacing the compulsiveness of fashion with enjoyment of rejecting the norm to create their own personal styling.
This rejection of seasonal fashion led to many protests in the 1960s alongside rejection of fashion on socialist, racial and environmental grounds. However, Mosmann has pointed out that the relationship between protesting fashion and creating fashion is dynamic because
the language and style used in these protests has then become part of fashion itself.

Fashion designers and brands have traditionally kept themselves out of political conflicts, there has been a movement in the industry towards taking more explicit positions across the political spectrum. From maintaining a rather apolitical stance, designers and brands today engage more explicitly in current debates.
For example, considering the U.S.&#x27;s political climate in the surrounding months of the 2016 presidential election, during 2017 fashion weeks in London, Milan, New York, Paris and São Paulo amongst others, many designers took the opportunity to take political stances leveraging their platforms and influence to reach their customers. This has also led to some controversy over democratic values, as fashion is not always the most inclusive platform for political debate, but a one-way broadcast of top-down messages.
When taking an explicit political stance, designers generally favor issues that can be identified in clear language with virtuous undertones. For example, aiming to &quot;amplify a greater message of unity, inclusion, diversity, and feminism in a fashion space&quot;, designer Mara Hoffman invited the founders of the &quot;Women&#x27;s March on Washington&quot; to open her show which featured modern silhouettes of utilitarian wear, described by critics as &quot;Made for a modern warrior&quot; and &quot;Clothing for those who still have work to do&quot;. Prabal Gurung debuted his collection of T-shirts featuring slogans such as &quot;The Future is Female&quot;, &quot;We Will Not Be Silenced&quot;, and &quot;Nevertheless She Persisted&quot;, with proceeds going to the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and Gurung&#x27;s own charity, &quot;Shikshya Foundation Nepal&quot;. Similarly, &quot;The Business of Fashion&quot; launched the &quot;#TiedTogether&quot; movement on Social Media, encouraging member of the industry from editors to models, to wear a white bandana advocating for &quot;unity, solidarity, and inclusiveness during fashion week&quot;.

Fashion may be used to promote a cause, such as to promote healthy behavior, to raise money for a cancer cure, or to raise money for local charities such as the Juvenile Protective Association or a children&#x27;s hospice.

One fashion cause is trashion, which is using trash to make clothes, jewelry, and other fashion items in order to promote awareness of pollution. There are a number of modern trashion artists such as Marina DeBris, Ann Wizer, and Nancy Judd. Other designers have used DIY fashions, in the tradition of the punk movement, to address elitism in the industry to promote more inclusion and diversity.

==Anthropological perspective==

From an academic lens, the sporting of various fashions has been seen as a form of fashion language, a mode of communication that produced various fashion statements, using a grammar of fashion. This is a perspective promoted in the work of influential French philosopher and semiotician Roland Barthes.

Anthropology, the study of culture and of human societies, examines fashion by asking why certain styles are deemed socially appropriate and others are not. From the theory of interactionism, a certain practice or expression is chosen by those in power in a community, and that becomes &quot;the fashion&quot; as defined at a certain time by the people under influence of those in power. If a particular style has a meaning in an already occurring set of beliefs, then that style may have a greater chance of become fashion.

According to cultural theorists Ted Polhemus and Lynn Procter, one can describe fashion as adornment, of which there are two types: fashion and anti-fashion. Through the capitalization and commoditization of clothing, accessories, and shoes, etc., what once constituted anti-fashion becomes part of fashion as the lines between fashion and anti-fashion are blurred, as expressions that were once outside the changes of fashion are swept along with trends to signify new meanings. Examples range from how elements from ethnic dress becomes part of a trend and appear on catwalks or street cultures, for example how tattoos travel from sailors, laborers and criminals to popular culture.

To cultural theorist Malcolm Bernard, fashion and anti-fashion differ as polar opposites. Anti-fashion is fixed and changes little over time, varying depending on the cultural or social group one is associated with or where one lives, but within that group or locality the style changes little. Fashion, in contrast, can change (evolve) very quickly and is not affiliated with one group or area of the world but spreads throughout the world wherever people can communicate easily with each other. An example of anti-fashion would be ceremonial or otherwise traditional clothing where specific garments and their designs are both reproduced faithfully and with the intent of maintaining a status quo of tradition. This can be seen in the clothing of some kabuki plays, where some character outfits are kept intact from designs of several centuries ago, in some cases retaining the crests of the actors considered to have &#x27;perfected&#x27; that role.

Anti-fashion is concerned with maintaining the status quo, while fashion is concerned with social mobility. Time is expressed in terms of continuity in anti-fashion, and in terms of change in fashion; fashion has changing modes of adornment, while anti-fashion has fixed modes of adornment.

From this theoretical lens, change in fashion is part of the larger industrial system and is structured by the powerful actors in this system to be a deliberate change in style, promoted through the channels influenced by the industry (such as paid advertisements).

==Intellectual property==

In the fashion industry, intellectual property is not enforced as it is within the film industry and music industry. Robert Glariston, an intellectual property expert, mentioned in a fashion seminar held in LA that &quot;Copyright law regarding clothing is a current hot-button issue in the industry. We often have to draw the line between designers being inspired by a design and those outright stealing it in different places.&quot; To take inspiration from others&#x27; designs contributes to the fashion industry&#x27;s ability to establish clothing trends. For the past few years, WGSN has been a dominant source of fashion news and forecasts in encouraging fashion brands worldwide to be inspired by one another. Enticing consumers to buy clothing by establishing new trends is, some have argued, a key component of the industry&#x27;s success. Intellectual property rules that interfere with this process of trend-making would, in this view, be counter-productive. On the other hand, it is often argued that the blatant theft of new ideas, unique designs, and design details by larger companies is what often contributes to the failure of many smaller or independent design companies.

Since fakes are distinguishable by their poorer quality, there is still a demand for luxury goods, and as only a trademark or logo can be copyrighted, many fashion brands make this one of the most visible aspects of the garment or accessory. In handbags, especially, the designer&#x27;s brand may be woven into the fabric (or the lining fabric) from which the bag is made, making the brand an intrinsic element of the bag.

In 2005, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) held a conference calling for stricter intellectual property enforcement within the fashion industry to better protect small and medium businesses and promote competitiveness within the textile and clothing industries.

<text>In mathematics, Fourier analysis () is the study of the way general functions may be represented or approximated by sums of simpler trigonometric functions. Fourier analysis grew from the study of Fourier series, and is named after Joseph Fourier, who showed that representing a function as a sum of trigonometric functions greatly simplifies the study of heat transfer.

The subject of Fourier analysis encompasses a vast spectrum of mathematics. In the sciences and engineering, the process of decomposing a function into oscillatory components is often called Fourier analysis, while the operation of rebuilding the function from these pieces is known as Fourier synthesis. For example, determining what component frequencies are present in a musical note would involve computing the Fourier transform of a sampled musical note. One could then re-synthesize the same sound by including the frequency components as revealed in the Fourier analysis. In mathematics, the term &quot;Fourier analysis&quot; often refers to the study of both operations.

The decomposition process itself is called a Fourier transformation. Its output, the Fourier transform, is often given a more specific name, which depends on the domain and other properties of the function being transformed. Moreover, the original concept of Fourier analysis has been extended over time to apply to more and more abstract and general situations, and the general field is often known as harmonic analysis. Each transform used for analysis (see list of Fourier-related transforms) has a corresponding inverse transform that can be used for synthesis.

To use Fourier analysis, data must be equally spaced. Different approaches have been developed for analyzing unequally spaced data, notably the least-squares spectral analysis (LSSA) methods that use a least squares fit of sinusoids to data samples, similar to Fourier analysis. Fourier analysis, the most used spectral method in science, generally boosts long-periodic noise in long gapped records; LSSA mitigates such problems.

==Applications==
Fourier analysis has many scientific applications – in physics, partial differential equations, number theory, combinatorics, signal processing, digital image processing, probability theory, statistics, forensics, option pricing, cryptography, numerical analysis, acoustics, oceanography, sonar, optics, diffraction, geometry, protein structure analysis, and other areas.

This wide applicability stems from many useful properties of the transforms:
* The transforms are linear operators and, with proper normalization, are unitary as well (a property known as Parseval&#x27;s theorem or, more generally, as the Plancherel theorem, and most generally via Pontryagin duality).
* The transforms are usually invertible.
* The exponential functions are eigenfunctions of differentiation, which means that this representation transforms linear differential equations with constant coefficients into ordinary algebraic ones. Therefore, the behavior of a linear time-invariant system can be analyzed at each frequency independently.
* By the convolution theorem, Fourier transforms turn the complicated convolution operation into simple multiplication, which means that they provide an efficient way to compute convolution-based operations such as signal filtering, polynomial multiplication, and multiplying large numbers.
* The discrete version of the Fourier transform (see below) can be evaluated quickly on computers using fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms.

In forensics, laboratory infrared spectrophotometers use Fourier transform analysis for measuring the wavelengths of light at which a material will absorb in the infrared spectrum. The FT method is used to decode the measured signals and record the wavelength data. And by using a computer, these Fourier calculations are rapidly carried out, so that in a matter of seconds, a computer-operated FT-IR instrument can produce an infrared absorption pattern comparable to that of a prism instrument.

Fourier transformation is also useful as a compact representation of a signal. For example, JPEG compression uses a variant of the Fourier transformation (discrete cosine transform) of small square pieces of a digital image. The Fourier components of each square are rounded to lower arithmetic precision, and weak components are eliminated, so that the remaining components can be stored very compactly. In image reconstruction, each image square is reassembled from the preserved approximate Fourier-transformed components, which are then inverse-transformed to produce an approximation of the original image.

In signal processing, the Fourier transform often takes a time series or a function of continuous time, and maps it into a frequency spectrum. That is, it takes a function from the time domain into the frequency domain; it is a decomposition of a function into sinusoids of different frequencies; in the case of a Fourier series or discrete Fourier transform, the sinusoids are harmonics of the fundamental frequency of the function being analyzed.

When a function formula_1 is a function of time and represents a physical signal, the transform has a standard interpretation as the frequency spectrum of the signal. The magnitude of the resulting complex-valued function formula_2 at frequency formula_3 represents the amplitude of a frequency component whose initial phase is given by the angle of formula_2 (polar coordinates).

Fourier transforms are not limited to functions of time, and temporal frequencies. They can equally be applied to analyze &quot;spatial&quot; frequencies, and indeed for nearly any function domain. This justifies their use in such diverse branches as image processing, heat conduction, and automatic control.

When processing signals, such as audio, radio waves, light waves, seismic waves, and even images, Fourier analysis can isolate narrowband components of a compound waveform, concentrating them for easier detection or removal. A large family of signal processing techniques consist of Fourier-transforming a signal, manipulating the Fourier-transformed data in a simple way, and reversing the transformation.

Some examples include:
* Equalization of audio recordings with a series of bandpass filters;
* Digital radio reception without a superheterodyne circuit, as in a modern cell phone or radio scanner;
* Image processing to remove periodic or anisotropic artifacts such as jaggies from interlaced video, strip artifacts from strip aerial photography, or wave patterns from radio frequency interference in a digital camera;
* Cross correlation of similar images for co-alignment;
* X-ray crystallography to reconstruct a crystal structure from its diffraction pattern;
* Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to determine the mass of ions from the frequency of cyclotron motion in a magnetic field;
* Many other forms of spectroscopy, including infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies;
* Generation of sound spectrograms used to analyze sounds;
* Passive sonar used to classify targets based on machinery noise.

==Variants of Fourier analysis==
===(Continuous) Fourier transform===
Most often, the unqualified term Fourier transform refers to the transform of functions of a continuous real argument, and it produces a continuous function of frequency, known as a &quot;frequency distribution&quot;. One function is transformed into another, and the operation is reversible. When the domain of the input (initial) function is time (formula_5), and the domain of the output (final) function is ordinary frequency, the transform of function formula_1 at frequency formula_3 is given by the complex number:

:formula_8

Evaluating this quantity for all values of formula_3 produces the &quot;frequency-domain&quot; function. Then formula_1 can be represented as a recombination of complex exponentials of all possible frequencies:

:formula_11

which is the inverse transform formula. The complex number, formula_12 conveys both amplitude and phase of frequency formula_13

See Fourier transform for much more information, including:
* conventions for amplitude normalization and frequency scaling/units
* transform properties
* tabulated transforms of specific functions
* an extension/generalization for functions of multiple dimensions, such as images.

===Fourier series===
The Fourier transform of a periodic function, formula_14 with period formula_15 becomes a Dirac comb function, modulated by a sequence of complex coefficients:

:formula_16     (where formula_17 is the integral over any interval of length formula_18).

The inverse transform, known as Fourier series, is a representation of formula_19 in terms of a summation of a potentially infinite number of harmonically related sinusoids or complex exponential functions, each with an amplitude and phase specified by one of the coefficients:

:formula_20

Any formula_19 can be expressed as a periodic summation of another function, formula_1:

:formula_23

and the coefficients are proportional to samples of formula_2 at discrete intervals of formula_25:

:formula_26

Note that any formula_1 whose transform has the same discrete sample values can be used in the periodic summation. A sufficient condition for recovering formula_1 (and therefore formula_2) from just these samples (i.e. from the Fourier series) is that the non-zero portion of formula_1 be confined to a known interval of duration formula_15 which is the frequency domain dual of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem.

See Fourier series for more information, including the historical development.

===Discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT)===
The DTFT is the mathematical dual of the time-domain Fourier series. Thus, a convergent periodic summation in the frequency domain can be represented by a Fourier series, whose coefficients are samples of a related continuous time function:

:formula_32

which is known as the DTFT. Thus the DTFT of the formula_33 sequence is also the Fourier transform of the modulated Dirac comb function.

The Fourier series coefficients (and inverse transform), are defined by:

:formula_34

Parameter formula_35 corresponds to the sampling interval, and this Fourier series can now be recognized as a form of the Poisson summation formula.  Thus we have the important result that when a discrete data sequence, formula_36 is proportional to samples of an underlying continuous function, formula_37 one can observe a periodic summation of the continuous Fourier transform, formula_38 Note that any formula_1 with the same discrete sample values produces the same DTFT.  But under certain idealized conditions one can theoretically recover formula_2 and formula_1 exactly. A sufficient condition for perfect recovery is that the non-zero portion of formula_2 be confined to a known frequency interval of width formula_43  When that interval is formula_44 the applicable reconstruction formula is the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula. This is a cornerstone in the foundation of digital signal processing.

Another reason to be interested in formula_45 is that it often provides insight into the amount of aliasing caused by the sampling process.

Applications of the DTFT are not limited to sampled functions. See Discrete-time Fourier transform for more information on this and other topics, including:
* normalized frequency units
* windowing (finite-length sequences)
* transform properties
* tabulated transforms of specific functions

===Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)===
Similar to a Fourier series, the DTFT of a periodic sequence, formula_46 with period formula_47, becomes a Dirac comb function, modulated by a sequence of complex coefficients (see ):

:formula_48     (where formula_49 is the sum over any sequence of length formula_50)

The formula_51 sequence is customarily known as the DFT of one cycle of formula_52 It is also formula_47-periodic, so it is never necessary to compute more than formula_47 coefficients. The inverse transform, also known as a discrete Fourier series, is given by:

:formula_55   where formula_56 is the sum over any sequence of length formula_50

When formula_58 is expressed as a periodic summation of another function:

:formula_59   and   formula_60

the coefficients are samples of formula_45 at discrete intervals of formula_62:

:formula_63

Conversely, when one wants to compute an arbitrary number formula_64 of discrete samples of one cycle of a continuous DTFT, formula_65 it can be done by computing the relatively simple DFT of formula_46 as defined above. In most cases, formula_47 is chosen equal to the length of the non-zero portion of formula_68 Increasing formula_69 known as &quot;zero-padding&quot; or &quot;interpolation&quot;, results in more closely spaced samples of one cycle of formula_70 Decreasing formula_69 causes overlap (adding) in the time-domain (analogous to aliasing), which corresponds to decimation in the frequency domain. (see ) In most cases of practical interest, the formula_33 sequence represents a longer sequence that was truncated by the application of a finite-length window function or FIR filter array.

The DFT can be computed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, which makes it a practical and important transformation on computers.

* transform properties
* applications
* tabulated transforms of specific functions

===Summary===
For periodic functions, both the Fourier transform and the DTFT comprise only a discrete set of frequency components (Fourier series), and the transforms diverge at those frequencies. One common practice (not discussed above) is to handle that divergence via Dirac delta and Dirac comb functions. But the same spectral information can be discerned from just one cycle of the periodic function, since all the other cycles are identical. Similarly, finite-duration functions can be represented as a Fourier series, with no actual loss of information except that the periodicity of the inverse transform is a mere artifact.

It is common in practice for the duration of &quot;s&quot;(•) to be limited to the period, or .  But these formulas do not require that condition.


==Symmetry properties==
When the real and imaginary parts of a complex function are decomposed into their even and odd parts, there are four components, denoted below by the subscripts RE, RO, IE, and IO. And there is a one-to-one mapping between the four components of a complex time function and the four components of its complex frequency transform:

:formula_73

From this, various relationships are apparent, for example:
*The transform of a real-valued function formula_74 is the &quot;conjugate symmetric&quot; function formula_75 Conversely, a &quot;conjugate symmetric&quot; transform implies a real-valued time-domain.
*The transform of an imaginary-valued function formula_76 is the &quot;conjugate antisymmetric&quot; function formula_77 and the converse is true.
*The transform of a &quot;conjugate symmetric&quot; function formula_78 is the real-valued function formula_79 and the converse is true.
*The transform of a &quot;conjugate antisymmetric&quot; function formula_80 is the imaginary-valued function formula_81 and the converse is true.

==History==
An early form of harmonic series dates back to ancient Babylonian mathematics, where they were used to compute ephemerides (tables of astronomical positions).

The Classical Greek concepts of deferent and epicycle in the Ptolemaic system of astronomy were related to Fourier series (see ).

In modern times, variants of the discrete Fourier transform were used by Alexis Clairaut in 1754 to compute an orbit,
which has been described as the first formula for the DFT,
and in 1759 by Joseph Louis Lagrange, in computing the coefficients of a trigonometric series for a vibrating string. Technically, Clairaut&#x27;s work was a cosine-only series (a form of discrete cosine transform), while Lagrange&#x27;s work was a sine-only series (a form of discrete sine transform); a true cosine+sine DFT was used by Gauss in 1805 for trigonometric interpolation of asteroid orbits.
Euler and Lagrange both discretized the vibrating string problem, using what would today be called samples.

An early modern development toward Fourier analysis was the 1770 paper &quot;Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations&quot; by Lagrange, which in the method of Lagrange resolvents used a complex Fourier decomposition to study the solution of a cubic:
Lagrange transformed the roots formula_82 formula_83 formula_84 into the resolvents:

:formula_85
where is a cubic root of unity, which is the DFT of order 3.

A number of authors, notably Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert, and Carl Friedrich Gauss used trigonometric series to study the heat equation, but the breakthrough development was the 1807 paper &quot;Mémoire sur la propagation de la chaleur dans les corps solides&quot; by Joseph Fourier, whose crucial insight was to model &quot;all&quot; functions by trigonometric series, introducing the Fourier series. Independently of Fourier, astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel also introduced Fourier series to solve Kepler&#x27;s equation. His work was published in 1819, unaware of Fourier&#x27;s work which remained unpublished until 1822.

Historians are divided as to how much to credit Lagrange and others for the development of Fourier theory: Daniel Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler had introduced trigonometric representations of functions, and Lagrange had given the Fourier series solution to the wave equation, so Fourier&#x27;s contribution was mainly the bold claim that an arbitrary function could be represented by a Fourier series. 

The subsequent development of the field is known as harmonic analysis, and is also an early instance of representation theory.

The first fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm for the DFT was discovered around 1805 by Carl Friedrich Gauss when interpolating measurements of the orbit of the asteroids Juno and Pallas, although that particular FFT algorithm is more often attributed to its modern rediscoverers Cooley and Tukey.
==Time–frequency transforms==
In signal processing terms, a function (of time) is a representation of a signal with perfect &quot;time resolution&quot;, but no frequency information, while the Fourier transform has perfect &quot;frequency resolution&quot;, but no time information.

As alternatives to the Fourier transform, in time–frequency analysis, one uses time–frequency transforms to represent signals in a form that has some time information and some frequency information – by the uncertainty principle, there is a trade-off between these. These can be generalizations of the Fourier transform, such as the short-time Fourier transform, the Gabor transform or fractional Fourier transform (FRFT), or can use different functions to represent signals, as in wavelet transforms and chirplet transforms, with the wavelet analog of the (continuous) Fourier transform being the continuous wavelet transform.

==Fourier transforms on arbitrary locally compact abelian topological groups==
The Fourier variants can also be generalized to Fourier transforms on arbitrary locally compact Abelian topological groups, which are studied in harmonic analysis; there, the Fourier transform takes functions on a group to functions on the dual group. This treatment also allows a general formulation of the convolution theorem, which relates Fourier transforms and convolutions. See also the Pontryagin duality for the generalized underpinnings of the Fourier transform.

More specific, Fourier analysis can be done on cosets, even discrete cosets.

<doc id="11660" wikidata="Q188163" url="?curid=11660" title="Fat Man">
<text>&quot;Fat Man&quot; (also known as Mark III) was the type of nuclear weapon the United States detonated over the Japanese city of Nagasaki on 9 August 1945. It was the second and largest of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in warfare, the first being Little Boy, and its detonation marked the third nuclear explosion in history. The first one was built by scientists and engineers at Los Alamos Laboratory using plutonium manufactured at the Hanford Site and was dropped from the Boeing B-29 Superfortress &quot;Bockscar&quot; piloted by Major Charles Sweeney.

The name Fat Man refers to the early design of the bomb because it had a wide, round shape. Fat Man was an implosion-type nuclear weapon with a solid plutonium core. The first of that type to be detonated was the Gadget in the Trinity nuclear test less than a month earlier on 16 July at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range in New Mexico. Two more were detonated during the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946, and some 120 were produced between 1947 and 1949, when it was superseded by the Mark 4 nuclear bomb. The Fat Man was retired in 1950.

==Early decisions==
Robert Oppenheimer held conferences in Chicago in June 1942, and in Berkeley, California, in July, at which various engineers and physicists discussed nuclear bomb design issues. They chose a gun-type design in which two sub-critical masses would be brought together by firing a &quot;bullet&quot; into a &quot;target&quot;. Richard C. Tolman suggested an implosion-type nuclear weapon, but the proposal attracted little interest.

The feasibility of a plutonium bomb was questioned in 1942. Wallace Akers, the director of the British &quot;Tube Alloys&quot; project, told James Bryant Conant on 14 November that James Chadwick had &quot;concluded that plutonium might not be a practical fissionable material for weapons because of impurities&quot;. Conant consulted Ernest Lawrence and Arthur Compton, who acknowledged that their scientists at Berkeley and Chicago, respectively, knew about the problem, but they could offer no ready solution. Conant informed Manhattan Project director Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr., who in turn assembled a special committee consisting of Lawrence, Compton, Oppenheimer, and McMillan to examine the issue. The committee concluded that any problems could be overcome simply by requiring higher purity.

Oppenheimer reviewed his options in early 1943 and gave priority to the gun-type weapon, but he created the E-5 Group at the Los Alamos Laboratory under Seth Neddermeyer to investigate implosion as a hedge against the threat of pre-detonation. Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely. Nonetheless, it was decided that the plutonium gun would receive the bulk of the research effort, since it was the project with the least uncertainty involved. It was assumed that the uranium gun-type bomb could be easily adapted from it.

==Naming==

The gun-type and implosion-type designs were codenamed &quot;Thin Man&quot; and &quot;Fat Man&quot;, respectively. These code names were created by Robert Serber, a former student of Oppenheimer&#x27;s who worked on the Manhattan Project. He chose them based on their design shapes; the Thin Man was a very long device, and the name came from the Dashiell Hammett detective novel &quot;The Thin Man&quot; and series of movies. The Fat Man was round and fat and was named after Sydney Greenstreet&#x27;s character in Hammett&#x27;s &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;. The Little Boy uranium gun-type design came later and was named only to contrast with the Thin Man. Los Alamos&#x27;s Thin Man and Fat Man code names were adopted by the United States Army Air Forces in their involvement in the Manhattan Project, codenamed Silverplate. A cover story was devised that Silverplate was about modifying a Pullman car for use by President Franklin Roosevelt (Thin Man) and United Kingdom Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Fat Man) on a secret tour of the United States. Air Forces personnel used the code names over the phone to make it sound as though they were modifying a plane for Roosevelt and Churchill.

==Development==
Neddermeyer discarded Serber and Tolman&#x27;s initial concept of implosion as assembling a series of pieces in favor of one in which a hollow sphere was imploded by an explosive shell. He was assisted in this work by Hugh Bradner, Charles Critchfield, and John Streib. L. T. E. Thompson was brought in as a consultant and discussed the problem with Neddermeyer in June 1943. Thompson was skeptical that an implosion could be made sufficiently symmetric. Oppenheimer arranged for Neddermeyer and Edwin McMillan to visit the National Defense Research Committee&#x27;s Explosives Research Laboratory near the laboratories of the Bureau of Mines in Bruceton, Pennsylvania (a Pittsburgh suburb), where they spoke to George Kistiakowsky and his team. But Neddermeyer&#x27;s efforts in July and August at imploding tubes to produce cylinders tended to produce objects that resembled rocks. Neddermeyer was the only person who believed that implosion was practical, and only his enthusiasm kept the project alive.
Oppenheimer brought John von Neumann to Los Alamos in September to take a fresh look at implosion. After reviewing Neddermeyer&#x27;s studies, and discussing the matter with Edward Teller, von Neumann suggested the use of high explosives in shaped charges to implode a sphere, which he showed could not only result in a faster assembly of fissile material than was possible with the gun method, but greatly reduce the amount of material required because of the resulting higher density. The idea that, under such pressures, the plutonium metal would be compressed came from Teller, whose knowledge of how dense metals behaved under heavy pressure was influenced by his pre-war theoretical studies of the Earth&#x27;s core with George Gamow. The prospect of more-efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, Teller, and Hans Bethe, but they decided that an expert on explosives would be required. Kistiakowsky&#x27;s name was immediately suggested, and Kistiakowsky was brought into the project as a consultant in October.

The implosion project remained a backup until April 1944, when experiments by Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on the newly reactor-produced plutonium from the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge and the B Reactor at the Hanford Site showed that it contained impurities in the form of the isotope plutonium-240. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate and radioactivity than plutonium-239. The cyclotron-produced isotopes, on which the original measurements had been made, held much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that pre-detonation was highly likely and that the bomb would blow itself apart during the initial formation of critical mass, creating a &quot;fizzle.&quot; The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where pre--detonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was therefore implosion.

The impracticability of a gun-type bomb using plutonium was agreed at a meeting in Los Alamos on 17 July 1944. All gun-type work in the Manhattan Project was re-directed towards the Little Boy, enriched uranium gun design, and the Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized with almost all of the research focused on the problems of implosion for the Fat Man bomb. The idea of using shaped charges as three-dimensional explosive lenses came from James L. Tuck and was developed by von Neumann. The success of the bomb relied on absolute precision in all of the plates moving inward at the same time. To overcome the difficulty of synchronizing multiple detonations, Luis Alvarez and Lawrence Johnston invented exploding-bridgewire detonators to replace the less precise primacord detonation system. Robert Christy is credited with doing the calculations that showed how a solid subcritical sphere of plutonium could be compressed to a critical state, greatly simplifying the task, since earlier efforts had attempted the more-difficult compression of a hollow spherical shell. After Christy&#x27;s report, the solid-plutonium core weapon was referred to as the &quot;Christy Gadget&quot;.

The task of the metallurgists was to determine how to cast plutonium into a sphere. The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was believed to be the cause, but it was soon determined that there were multiple allotropes of plutonium. The brittle α phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic β phase at higher temperatures. Attention then shifted to the even more malleable δ phase that normally exists in the range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with alpha particles, which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a plutonium–gallium alloy, which stabilized the δ phase and could be hot pressed into the desired shape. They found it easier to cast hemispheres than spheres. The core consisted of two hemispheres with a ring with a triangular cross-section between them to keep them aligned and prevent jets forming. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.
The size of the bomb was constrained by the available aircraft, which were investigated for suitability by Norman Foster Ramsey. The only Allied bombers considered capable of carrying the Fat Man without major modification were the British Avro Lancaster and the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress. British scientist James Chadwick advocated the Lancaster which had a limited range but had a larger single bomb bay; but this was less of a problem when the Fat Man replaced the long ( Thin Man. At the time, the B-29 represented the epitome of bomber technology with significant advantages in maximum takeoff weight, range, speed, flight ceiling, and survivability. Without the availability of the B-29, dropping the bomb would likely have been impossible. However, this still constrained the bomb to a maximum length of , width of and weight of . Removing the bomb rails allowed a maximum width of .

Drop tests began in March 1944 and resulted in modifications to the Silverplate aircraft due to the weight of the bomb. High-speed photographs revealed that the tail fins folded under the pressure, resulting in an erratic descent. Various combinations of stabilizer boxes and fins were tested on the Fat Man shape to eliminate its persistent wobble until an arrangement dubbed a &quot;California Parachute&quot; was approved, a cubical open-rear tail box outer surface with eight radial fins inside of it, four angled at 45 degrees and four perpendicular to the line of fall holding the outer square-fin box to the bomb&#x27;s rear end. In drop tests in early weeks, the Fat Man missed its target by an average of , but this was halved by June as the bombardiers became more proficient with it.

The early Y-1222 model Fat Man was assembled with some 1,500 bolts. This was superseded by the Y-1291 design in December 1944. This redesign work was substantial, and only the Y-1222 tail design was retained. Later versions included the Y-1560, which had 72 detonators; the Y-1561, which had 32; and the Y-1562, which had 132. There were also the Y-1563 and Y-1564, which were practice bombs with no detonators at all. The final wartime Y-1561 design was assembled with just 90 bolts.
On 16 July 1945, a Y-1561 model Fat Man, known as the Gadget, was detonated in a test explosion at a remote site in New Mexico, known as the &quot;Trinity&quot; test. It gave a yield of about . Some minor changes were made to the design as a result of the Trinity test. Philip Morrison recalled that &quot;There were some changes of importance... The fundamental thing was, of course, very much the same.&quot;
==Interior==
The bomb was long and in diameter. It weighed .

==Assembly==

The plutonium pit was in diameter and contained an &quot;Urchin&quot; modulated neutron initiator that was in diameter. The depleted uranium tamper was an sphere, surrounded by a shell of boron-impregnated plastic. The plastic shell had a cylindrical hole running through it, like the hole in a cored apple, in order to allow insertion of the pit as late as possible. The missing tamper cylinder containing the pit could be slipped in through a hole in the surrounding aluminum pusher. The pit was warm to the touch, emitting 2.4 W/kg-Pu, about 15 W for the core.

The explosion symmetrically compressed the plutonium to twice its normal density before the &quot;Urchin&quot; added free neutrons to initiate a fission chain reaction.

The result was the fission of about of the of plutonium in the pit, or about 16% of the fissile material present. The detonation released the energy equivalent to the detonation of . About 30% of the yield came from fission of the uranium tamper.

==Bombing of Nagasaki==
===Assembly===

The first plutonium core was transported with its polonium-beryllium modulated neutron initiator in the custody of Project Alberta courier Raemer Schreiber in a magnesium field carrying case designed for the purpose by Philip Morrison. Magnesium was chosen because it does not act as a tamper. It left Kirtland Army Air Field on a C-54 transport aircraft of the 509th Composite Group&#x27;s 320th Troop Carrier Squadron on 26 July and arrived at North Field on Tinian on 28 July. Three Fat Man high-explosive pre-assemblies (designated F31, F32, and F33) were picked up at Kirtland on 28 July by three B-29s: &quot;Luke the Spook&quot; and &quot;Laggin&#x27; Dragon&quot; from the 509th Composite Group&#x27;s 393d Bombardment Squadron, and another from the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit. The cores were transported to North Field, arriving on 2 August, when F31 was partly disassembled in order to check all its components. F33 was expended near Tinian during a final rehearsal on 8 August. F32 presumably would have been used for a third attack or its rehearsal.

On 7 August, the day after the bombing of Hiroshima, Rear Admiral William R. Purnell, Commodore William S. Parsons, Tibbets, General Carl Spaatz and Major General Curtis LeMay met on Guam to discuss what should be done next. Since there was no indication of Japan surrendering, they decided to proceed with their orders and drop another bomb. Parsons said that Project Alberta would have it ready by 11 August, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm and asked if the bomb could be made ready by 9 August. Parsons agreed to try to do so.

Fat Man F31 was assembled on Tinian by Project Alberta personnel, and the physics package was fully assembled and wired. It was placed inside its ellipsoidal aerodynamic bombshell, which was painted mustard yellow, and wheeled out, where it was signed by nearly 60 people, including Purnell, Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell, and Parsons. The acronym &quot;JANCFU&quot; was stenciled on the bomb&#x27;s nose, standing for &quot;Joint Army-Navy-Civilian Fuckup&quot;, a play on the acronym &quot;SNAFU&quot;. It was then wheeled to the bomb bay of the B-29 Superfortress named &quot;Bockscar&quot; after the plane&#x27;s command pilot Captain Frederick C. Bock, who flew &quot;The Great Artiste&quot; with his crew on the mission. &quot;Bockscar&quot; was flown by Major Charles W. Sweeney and his crew, with Commander Frederick L. Ashworth from Project Alberta as the weaponeer in charge of the bomb.

===Detonation===


&quot;Bockscar&quot; lifted off at 03:47 on 9 August 1945, with Kokura as the primary target and Nagasaki the secondary target. The weapon was already armed but with the green electrical safety plugs still engaged. Ashworth changed them to red after ten minutes so that Sweeney could climb to in order to get above storm clouds. During the pre-flight inspection of &quot;Bockscar&quot;, the flight engineer notified Sweeney that an inoperative fuel transfer pump made it impossible to use of fuel carried in a reserve tank. This fuel would still have to be carried all the way to Japan and back, consuming still more fuel. Replacing the pump would take hours; moving the Fat Man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well, as the bomb was live. Colonel Paul Tibbets and Sweeney therefore elected to have &quot;Bockscar&quot; continue the mission.
Kokura was obscured by clouds and drifting smoke from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby Yahata the previous day. This covered 70% of the area over Kokura, obscuring the aiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel and repeatedly exposing the aircraft to the heavy defenses of Yahata, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By the time of the third bomb run, Japanese anti-aircraft fire was getting close; Second Lieutenant Jacob Beser was monitoring Japanese communications, and he reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.

Sweeney then proceeded to the alternative target of Nagasaki. It was obscured by clouds as well, and Ashworth ordered Sweeney to make a radar approach. At the last minute, however, bombardier Captain Kermit K. Beahan found a hole in the clouds. The Fat Man was dropped and exploded at 11:02 local time, following a 43-second free-fall, at an altitude of about . There was poor visibility due to cloud cover, and the bomb missed its intended detonation point by almost two miles, so the damage was somewhat less extensive than that in Hiroshima.

An estimated 35,000–40,000 people were killed outright by the bombing at Nagasaki. A total of 60,000–80,000 fatalities resulted, including from long-term health effects, the strongest of which was leukemia with an attributable risk of 46% for bomb victims. Others died later from related blast and burn injuries, and hundreds more from radiation illnesses from exposure to the bomb&#x27;s initial radiation. Most of the direct deaths and injuries were among munitions or industrial workers.

Mitsubishi&#x27;s industrial production in the city was severed by the attack; the dockyard would have produced at 80 percent of its full capacity within three to four months, the steelworks would have required a year to get back to substantial production, the electric works would have resumed some production within two months and been back at capacity within six months, and the arms plant would have required 15 months to return to 60 to 70 percent of former capacity. The Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works, which manufactured the Type 91 torpedoes released in the attack on Pearl Harbor, was destroyed in the blast.

==Post-war development==

After the war, two Y-1561 Fat Man bombs were used in the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific. The first was known as &quot;Gilda&quot; after Rita Hayworth&#x27;s character in the 1946 movie &quot;Gilda,&quot; and it was dropped by the B-29 &quot;Dave&#x27;s Dream&quot;; it missed its aim point by . The second bomb was nicknamed &quot;Helen of Bikini&quot; and was placed without its tail fin assembly in a steel caisson made from a submarine&#x27;s conning tower; it was detonated beneath the landing craft USS &quot;LSM-60&quot;. The two weapons yielded about each.

The Los Alamos Laboratory and the Army Air Forces had already commenced work on improving the design. The North American B-45 Tornado, Convair XB-46, Martin XB-48, and Boeing B-47 Stratojet bombers had bomb bays sized to carry the Grand Slam, which was much longer but not as wide as the Fat Man. The only American bombers that could carry the Fat Man were the B-29 and the Convair B-36. In November 1945, the Army Air Forces asked Los Alamos for 200 Fat Man bombs, but there were only two sets of plutonium cores and high-explosive assemblies at the time. The Army Air Forces wanted improvements to the design to make it easier to manufacture, assemble, handle, transport, and stockpile. The wartime Project W-47 was continued, and drop tests resumed in January 1946.
The Mark III Mod 0 Fat Man was ordered into production in mid-1946. High explosives were manufactured by the Salt Wells Pilot Plant, which had been established by the Manhattan Project as part of Project Camel, and a new plant was established at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant. Mechanical components were made or procured by the Rock Island Arsenal; electrical and mechanical components for about 50 bombs were stockpiled at Kirtland Army Air Field by August 1946, but only nine plutonium cores were available. Production of the Mod 0 ended in December 1948, by which time there were still only 53 cores available. It was replaced by improved versions known as Mods 1 and 2 which contained a number of minor changes, the most important of which was that they did not charge the X-Unit firing system&#x27;s capacitors until released from the aircraft. The Mod 0s were withdrawn from service between March and July 1949, and by October they had all been rebuilt as Mods 1 and 2. Some 120 Mark III Fat Man units were added to the stockpile between 1947 and 1949, when it was superseded by the Mark 4 nuclear bomb. The Mark III Fat Man was retired in 1950.

A nuclear strike would have been a formidable undertaking in the post-war 1940s due to the limitations of the Mark III Fat Man. The lead-acid batteries which powered the fuzing system remained charged for only 36 hours, after which they needed to be recharged. To do this meant disassembling the bomb, and recharging took 72 hours. The batteries had to be removed in any case after nine days or they corroded. The plutonium core could not be left in for much longer, because its heat damaged the high explosives. Replacing the core also required the bomb to be completely disassembled and reassembled. This required about 40 to 50 men and took between 56 and 72 hours, depending on the skill of the bomb assembly team, and the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project had only three teams in June 1948. The only aircraft capable of carrying the bomb were Silverplate B-29s, and the only group equipped with them was the 509th Bombardment Group at Walker Air Force Base in Roswell, New Mexico. They would first have to fly to Sandia Base to collect the bombs and then to an overseas base from which a strike could be mounted. In March 1948, during the Berlin Blockade, all the assembly teams were in Eniwetok for the Operation Sandstone test, and the military teams were not yet qualified to assemble atomic weapons.

In June 1948, General Omar Bradley, Major General Alfred Gruenther and Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe visited Sandia and Los Alamos to be shown the &quot;special requirements&quot; of atomic weapons. Gruenther asked Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols (hosting): &quot;When are you going to show us the real thing? Surely this laboratory monstrosity is not the only type of atomic bomb we have in stockpile?&quot; Nichols told him that better weapons would soon become available. After the &quot;astonishingly good&quot; results of Operation Sandstone were available, stockpiling of improved weapons began.

The Soviet Union&#x27;s first nuclear weapon was based closely on Fat Man&#x27;s design thanks to spies Klaus Fuchs, Theodore Hall, and David Greenglass, who provided them with secret information concerning the Manhattan Project and Fat Man. It was detonated on 29 August 1949 as part of Operation &quot;First Lightning&quot;.

<doc id="11661" wikidata="Q3064815" url="?curid=11661" title="False Claims Act of 1863">
<text>The False Claims Act of 1863 (FCA) is an American federal law that imposes liability on persons and companies (typically federal contractors) who defraud governmental programs. It is the federal government&#x27;s primary litigation tool in combating fraud against the government. The law includes a &quot;qui tam&quot; provision that allows people who are not affiliated with the government, called &quot;relators&quot; under the law, to file actions on behalf of the government. This is informally called &quot;whistleblowing&quot;, especially when the relator is employed by the organization accused in the suit. Persons filing actions under the Act stand to receive a portion (15–30%, depending on certain factors) of any recovered damages.

As of 2019, over 71% of all FCA actions were initiated by whistleblowers. Claims under the law have typically involved government health care programs (Medicare, Medicaid and TriCare), military, or other government spending programs. FCA actions dominate the list of largest pharmaceutical settlements. Between 1987 and 2019, the government recovered more than $62 billion under the False Claims Act.

==History==
&quot;Qui tam&quot; laws have history dating back to the Middle Ages in England. In 1318, King Edward II offered one third of the penalty to the relator when the relator successfully sued government officials who moonlighted as wine merchants. The Maintenance and Embracery Act 1540 of Henry VIII provided that common informers could sue for certain forms of interference with the course of justice in legal proceedings that were concerned with the title to land. This act is still in force today in the Republic of Ireland, although in 1967 it was extinguished in England. The idea of a common informer bringing suit for damages to the Commonwealth was later brought to Massachusetts, where &quot;penalties for fraud in the sale of bread [are] to be distributed one third to inspector who discovered the fraud and the remainder for the benefit of the town where the offense occurred.&quot; Other statutes can be found on the colonial law books of Connecticut, New York, Virginia and South Carolina.

The American Civil War (1861–1865) was marked by fraud on all levels, both in the Union north and the Confederate south. During the war, unscrupulous contractors sold the Union Army decrepit horses and mules in ill health, faulty rifles and ammunition, and rancid rations and provisions, among other unscrupulous actions. In response, Congress passed the False Claims Act on March 2, 1863, . Because it was passed under the administration of President Abraham Lincoln, the False Claims Act is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Lincoln Law&quot;.

Importantly, a reward was offered in what is called the &quot;qui tam&quot; provision, which permits citizens to sue on behalf of the government and be paid a percentage of the recovery. &quot;Qui tam&quot; is an abbreviated form of the Latin legal phrase &quot;qui tam pro domino rege quam pro se ipso in hac parte sequitur&quot; (&quot;he who brings a case on behalf of our lord the King, as well as for himself&quot;) In a &quot;qui tam&quot; action, the citizen filing suit is called a &quot;relator&quot;. As an exception to the general legal rule of standing, courts have held that &quot;qui tam&quot; relators are &quot;partially assigned&quot; a portion of the government&#x27;s legal injury, thereby allowing relators to proceed with their suits.

U.S. Senator Jacob M. Howard, who sponsored the legislation, justified giving rewards to whistle blowers, many of whom had engaged in unethical activities themselves. He said, &quot;I have based the [&quot;qui tam&quot; provision] upon the old-fashioned idea of holding out a temptation, and ‘setting a rogue to catch a rogue,’ which is the safest and most expeditious way I have ever discovered of bringing rogues to justice.&quot;

In the massive military spending leading up to and during World War II, the US Attorney General relied on criminal provisions of the law to deal with fraud, rather than using the FCA. As a result, attorneys would wait for the Department of Justice to file criminal cases and then immediately file civil suits under the FCA, a practice decried as &quot;parasitic&quot; at the time. Congress moved to abolish the FCA but at the last minute decided instead to reduce the relator&#x27;s share of the recovered proceeds.

The law was again amended in 1986, again due to issues with military spending. Under President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s military buildup, reports of massive fraud among military contractors had become major news, and Congress acted to strengthen the FCA.

The first qui tam case under the amended False Claims Act was filed in 1987 by an eye surgeon against an eye clinic and one of its doctors, alleging unnecessary surgeries and other procedures were being performed. The case settled in 1988 for a total of $605,000. However, the law was primarily used in the beginning against defense contractors. By the late 1990s, health care fraud began to receive more focus, accounting for approximately 40% of recoveries by 2008 &quot;Franklin v. Parke-Davis&quot;, filed in 1996, was the first case to apply the FCA to fraud committed by a pharma company against the government, due to bills submitted for payment by Medicaid/Medicare for treatments that those programs do not pay for as they are not FDA-approved or otherwise listed on a government formulary. FCA cases against pharma companies are often related to off-label marketing of drugs by drug companies, which is illegal under a different law, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the intersection occurs when off-label marketing leads to prescriptions being filled and bills for those prescriptions being submitted to Medicare/Medicaid.

As of 2019, over 72% of all federal FCA actions were initiated by whistleblowers. The government recovered $62.1 billion under the False Claims Act between 1987 and 2019 and of this amount, over $44.7 billion or 72% was from &quot;qui tam&quot; cases brought by relators. In 2014, whistleblowers filed over 700 False Claims Act lawsuits. In 2014, the Department of Justice had its highest annual recovery in False Claims Act history, obtaining more than $6.1 billion in settlements and judgments from civil cases involving fraud and false claims against the government. In fiscal year 2019, the Department of Justice recovered over $3 billion under the False Claims Act, $2.2 billion of which were generated by whistleblowers. Since 2010, the federal government has recovered over $37.6 billion in False Claims Act settlements and judgments. In 2020, the DOJ recovered $2.2 billion from FCA cases: $1.6 billion of that total was from cases filed under the FCA. &quot;Qui tam&quot; whistleblowers received a total of $309 million in whistleblower rewards in 2020.

==Provisions==
The Act establishes liability when any person or entity improperly receives from or avoids payment to the Federal government. The Act prohibits:

# Knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment or approval;
# Knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;
# Conspiring to commit any violation of the False Claims Act;
# Falsely certifying the type or amount of property to be used by the government;
# Certifying receipt of property on a document without completely knowing that the information is true;
# Knowingly buying government property from an unauthorized officer of the government, and;
# Knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record to avoid, or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit property to the government.
# The False Claims act does not apply to IRS Tax matters.
The statute provides that anyone who violates the law &quot;is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not less than $5,000 and not more than $10,000, as adjusted by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, plus 3 times the amount of damages which the Government sustains because of the act of that person.&quot; The False Claims Act requires a separate penalty for each violation of the statute. Under the Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act, False Claims Act penalties are periodically adjusted for inflation. In 2020, the penalties range from $11,665 to $23,331 per violation.

Certain claims are not actionable, including:
# certain actions against armed forces members, members of the United States Congress, members of the judiciary, or senior executive branch officials;
# claims, records, or statements made under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which would include tax fraud;

There are unique procedural requirements in False Claims Act cases. For example:
# a complaint under the False Claims Act must be filed under seal;
# the complaint must be served on the government but must not be served on the defendant;
# the complaint must be buttressed by a comprehensive memorandum, not filed in court, but served on the government detailing the factual underpinnings of the complaint.

In addition, the FCA contains an anti-retaliation provision, which allows a relator to recover, in addition to his award for reporting fraud, double damages plus attorney fees for any acts of retaliation for reporting fraud against the government. This provision specifically provides relators with a personal claim of double damages for harm suffered and reinstatement.

Under the False Claims Act, the Department of Justice is authorized to pay rewards to those who report fraud against the federal government and are not convicted of a crime related to the fraud, in an amount of between 15 and 25 (but up to 30% in some cases) of what it recovers based upon the whistleblower&#x27;s report. The relator&#x27;s share is determined based on the FCA itself, legislative history, Department of Justice guidelines released in 1997, and court decisions.

== 2009 changes ==
On May 20, 2009, the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA) was signed into law. It includes the most significant amendments to the FCA since the 1986 amendments. FERA enacted the following changes:

# Expanded the scope of potential FCA liability by eliminating the &quot;presentment&quot; requirement (effectively overruling the Supreme Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Allison Engine Co. v. United States ex rel. Sanders&quot;, 128 S. Ct. 2123 (2008));
# Redefined &quot;claim&quot; under the FCA to mean &quot;any request or demand, whether under a contract or otherwise for money or property and whether or not the United States has title to the money or property&quot; that is (1) presented directly to the United States, or (2) &quot;to a contractor, grantee, or other recipient, if the money or property is to be spent or used on the Government&#x27;s behalf or to advance a Government program or interest&quot; and the government provides or reimburses any portion of the requested funds;
# Amended the FCA&#x27;s intent requirement, and now requiring only that a false statement be &quot;material to&quot; a false claim;
# Expanded conspiracy liability for any violation of the provisions of the FCA;
# Amended the &quot;reverse false claims&quot; provisions to expand liability to &quot;knowingly and improperly avoid[ing] or decreas[ing] an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the Government;&quot;
# Increased protection for qui tam plaintiffs/relators beyond employees, to include contractors and agents;
# Procedurally, the government&#x27;s complaint will now relate back to the qui tam plaintiff/relator&#x27;s filing;
# Provided that whenever a state or local government is named as a co-plaintiff in an action, the government or the relator &quot;shall not [be] preclude[d]... from serving the complaint, any other pleadings, or the written disclosure of substantially all material evidence;&quot;
# Increased the Attorney General&#x27;s power to delegate authority to conduct Civil Investigative Demands prior to intervening in an FCA action.

With this revision, the FCA now prohibits knowingly (changes are in bold):

# Submitting for payment or reimbursement a claim known to be false or fraudulent.
# Making or using a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to an ‘obligation’ to pay money to the government.
# Engaging in a conspiracy to defraud by the improper submission of a false claim.
# Concealing, improperly avoiding or decreasing an ‘obligation’ to pay money to the government.

== 2010 changes under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ==

On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (also referred to as the health reform bill or PPACA) was signed into law by President Barack Obama. The Affordable Care Act made further amendments to the False Claims Act, including:

# Changes to the Public Disclosure Bar. Under the previous version of the FCA, cases filed by private individuals or &quot;relators&quot; could be barred if it was determined that such cases were based on a public disclosure of information arising from certain proceedings, such as civil, criminal or administrative hearings, or news media reports. As a result, defendants frequently used the public disclosure bar as a defense to a plaintiff&#x27;s claims and grounds for dismissal of the same. PPACA amended the language of the FCA to allow the federal government to have the final word on whether a court may dismiss a case based on a public disclosure. The language now provides that &quot;the court shall dismiss an action unless opposed by the Government, if substantially the same allegations or transaction alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed.&quot; &quot;See&quot; 31 U.S.C. 3730(e)(4)(A).
# Original Source Requirement. A plaintiff may overcome the public disclosure bar outlined above if they qualify as an &quot;original source,&quot; the definition of which has also been revised by PPACA. Previously, an original source must have had &quot;direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based.&quot; Under PPACA, an original source is now someone who has &quot;knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions.&quot; See 31 U.S.C. 3730(e)(4)(B).
# Overpayments. FERA redefined &quot;obligation&quot; under the FCA to include &quot;retention of any overpayments.&quot; Accordingly, such language imposed FCA liability on any provider who received Medicare/Medicaid overpayments (accidentally or otherwise) and fails to return the money to the government. However, FERA also raised questions as to what exactly is involved in the &quot;retention of overpayments&quot; – for example, how long a provider had to return monies after discovering an overpayment. PPACA clarified the changes to the FCA made by FERA. Under PPACA, overpayments under Medicare and Medicaid must be reported and returned within 60 days of discovery, or the date a corresponding hospital report is due. Failure to timely report and return an overpayment exposes a provider to liability under the FCA.
# Statutory Anti-Kickback Liability. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b) (AKS) is a criminal statute which makes it improper for anyone to solicit, receive, offer or pay remuneration (monetary or otherwise) in exchange for referring patients to receive certain services that are paid for by the government. Previously, many courts had interpreted the FCA to mean that claims submitted as a result of AKS violations were false claims and therefore gave rise to FCA liability (in addition to AKS penalties). However, although this was the &quot;majority rule&quot; among courts, there were always opportunities for courts to hold otherwise. Importantly, PPACA changed the language of the AKS to provide that claims submitted in violation of the AKS automatically constitute false claims for purposes of the FCA. Further, the new language of the AKS provides that &quot;a person need not have actual knowledge … or specific intent to commit a violation&quot; of the AKS. Accordingly, providers will not be able to successfully argue that they did not know they were violating the FCA because they were not aware the AKS existed.

==Practical application of the law==

The False Claims Act has a detailed process for making a claim. Mere complaints to the government agency are insufficient to bring claims under the Act. A complaint (lawsuit)
must be filed in a U.S. District Court (Federal court) &quot;in camera&quot; (under seal). The Department of Justice (DOJ) must thence investigate within 60 days, but it often enjoys several months&#x27; worth of extensions by the Court. In this time, the department decides whether it will pursue the case.

If the case is pursued by DOJ, the amount of the reward is less than if the Department of Justice had decided not to pursue the case and the plaintiff/relator continues the lawsuit himself. However, the success rate is higher in cases that the Department of Justice decides to pursue.

Technically, the government has several options in handing cases. These include: 
# intervene in one or more counts of the pending &quot;qui tam&quot; action. This intervention expresses the Government&#x27;s intention to participate as a plaintiff in prosecuting that count of the complaint. The department intervenes in fewer than 25% of filed &quot;qui tam&quot; actions.
# decline to intervene in one or all counts of the pending &quot;qui tam&quot; action. If the United States declines to intervene, the relator (i.e., plaintiff) may prosecute the action alone and thus on behalf of the United States, but the United States is not a party to the proceedings apart from its right to any recovery. This option is frequently used by relators and their attorneys.
# move to dismiss the relator&#x27;s complaint, either because there is no case, or the case conflicts with significant statutory or policy interests of the United States.

In practice, there are two other options for the Department of Justice:
# settle the pending &quot;qui tam&quot; action with the defendant prior to the intervention decision. This usually, but not always, results in a simultaneous intervention and settlement with the Department of Justice (and is included in the 25% intervention rate).
# advise the relator that the Department of Justice intends to decline intervention. This usually, but not always, results in dismissal of the &quot;qui tam&quot; action, according to the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
There is case law where claims may be prejudiced if disclosure of the alleged unlawful act has been reported in the press, if complaints were filed to an agency instead of filing a lawsuit, or if the person filing a claim under the act is not the first person to do so. Individual states in the U.S. have different laws regarding whistleblowing involving state governments.

===Federal income taxation of awards under FCA in the United States===
The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) takes the position that, for Federal income tax purposes, &quot;qui tam&quot; payments to a relator under FCA are ordinary income and not capital gains. The IRS position was challenged by a relator in the case of &quot;Alderson v. United States;&quot; and, in 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the IRS&#x27; stance. As of 2013, this remained the only circuit court decision on tax treatment of these payments.

==Relevant decisions by the United States Supreme Court==

In a 2000 case, &quot;Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens&quot;, 529 U.S. 765 (2000), the United States Supreme Court held that a private individual may not bring suit in federal court on behalf of the United States against a State (or state agency) under the FCA. In &quot;Stevens&quot;, the Supreme Court also endorsed the &quot;partial assignment&quot; approach to &quot;qui tam&quot; relator standing to sue, which had previously been articulated by the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals and is an exception to the general legal rule for standing.

In a 2007 case, &quot;Rockwell International Corp. v. United States&quot;, the United States Supreme Court considered several issues relating to the &quot;original source&quot; exception to the FCA&#x27;s public-disclosure bar. The Court held that (1) the original source requirement of the FCA provision setting for the original-source exception to the public-disclosure bar on federal-court jurisdiction is jurisdictional; (2) the statutory phrase &quot;information on which the allegations are based&quot; refers to the relator&#x27;s allegations and not the publicly disclosed allegations; the terms &quot;allegations&quot; is not limited to the allegations in the original complaint, but includes, at a minimum, the allegations in the original complaint as amended; (3) relator&#x27;s knowledge with respect to the pondcrete fell short of the direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based required for him to qualify as an original source; and (4) the government&#x27;s intervention did not provide an independent basis of jurisdiction with respect to the relator.

In a 2008 case, &quot;Allison Engine Co. v. United States ex rel. Sanders&quot;, the United States Supreme Court considered whether a false claim had to be presented directly to the Federal government, or if it merely needed to be paid with government money, such as a false claim by a subcontractor to a prime contractor. The Court found that the claim need not be presented directly to the government, but that the false statement must be made with the intention that it will be relied upon by the government in paying, or approving payment of, a claim. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 reversed the Court&#x27;s decision and made the types of fraud to which the False Claims Act applies more explicit.

In a 2009 case, &quot;United States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New York&quot;, the United States Supreme Court considered whether, when the government declines to intervene or otherwise actively participate in a &quot;qui tam&quot; action under the False Claims Act, the United States is a &quot;party&quot; to the suit for purposes of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A) (which requires that a notice of appeal in a federal civil action generally be filed within 30 days after entry of a judgment or order from which the appeal is taken). The Court held that when the United States has declined to intervene in a privately initiated FCA action, it is not a &quot;party&quot; for FRAP 4 purposes, and therefore, petitioner&#x27;s appeal filed after 30 days was untimely.

In a 2016 case, &quot;Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar&quot;, the United States Supreme Court sought to clarify the standard for materiality under the FCA. The court unanimously upheld the implied certification theory of FCA liability and strengthened the FCA&#x27;s materiality requirement.

In a 2023 combined case, &quot;&quot; and &quot;United States ex rel. Proctor v. Safeway&quot;, a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court opinion rejected an attempt to dilute the FCA&#x27;s &quot;knowledge standard.&quot; Under the knowledge standard, a defendant is liable under the FCA if a false claim is &quot;knowingly&quot; submitted to the government for payment. The statute defines &quot;knowingly&quot; as acting with actual knowledge, deliberate ignorance, or reckless disregard. The unanimous opinion found that a defendant is liable if it submits a false claim to the government based on its own knowledge and subjective beliefs — not what an objectively reasonable person may have thought.

In a 2024 case, &quot;Murray v. UBS Securities, LLC, et al.&quot; 601 U. S. 23 (2024), a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court endorsed a lower burden of proof for whistleblowers, holding that whistleblowers do not need to prove that an employer acted with &quot;retaliatory intent&quot; in order to be protected under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Supreme Court found that a whistleblower needs only to prove that their actions in making a whistleblower complaint were a &quot;contributing factor&quot; in the employer&#x27;s unfavorable action. The unanimous opinion found that liability hinges on a defendant&#x27;s “knowledge and subjective beliefs” — not what an objective, reasonable person would have thought — at the time they submitted their claims to the government.

==State False Claims Acts==
As of 2020, 29 states and the District of Columbia have false-claims laws modeled on the federal statute to protect their publicly funded programs from fraud by including qui tam provisions, which enables them to recover money at state level. Some of these state False Claims Act statutes provide similar protections to those of the federal law, while others limit recovery to claims of fraud related to the Medicaid program.

The California False Claims Act was enacted in 1987, but lay relatively dormant until the early 1990s, when public entities, frustrated by what they viewed as a barrage of unjustified and unmeritorious claims, began to employ the False Claims Act as a defensive measure.

In 1995, the State of Texas passed the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act (TMFPA), which specifically aims at combating fraud against the Texas Medicaid Program, which provides healthcare and prescription drug coverage to low-income individuals. The Texas law enacts state qui tam provisions that allow individuals to report fraud and initiate action against violations of the TMFPA, imposes consequences for noncompliance and includes whistleblower protections.

==Influence on other countries==
===Australia===
In Australia, The Treasury Laws Amendment (Enhancing Whistleblower Protections) Act, was passed in December 2018 and went into effect in 2019. The law expanded protections for whistleblowers, allowing them to report misconduct anonymously, as well as applying anti-retaliation protections to additional kinds of whistleblowers. Importantly, the law does not provide for rewards for whistleblowers. There have been calls since 2011 for legislation modeled on the False Claims Act and for their application to the tobacco industry and carbon pricing schemes.

===United Kingdom===
In October 2013, the UK Government announced that it was considering the case for financially incentivising individuals reporting fraud in economic crime cases by private sector organisations, in an approach much like the US False Claims Act. The &#x27;Serious and Organised Crime Strategy&#x27; paper released by the UK&#x27;s Secretary of State for the Home Department sets out how that government plans to take action to prevent serious and organised crime and strengthen protections against and responses to it. The paper asserted that serious and organised crime costs the UK more than £24 billion a year. In the context of anti-corruption, the paper acknowledged that there was a need to not only target serious and organised criminals but also support those who seek to help identify and disrupt serious and organised criminality.

Three UK agencies, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office, were tasked with considering the case for a US-style False Claims Act in the UK. In July 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England Prudential Regulation Authority recommended Parliament enact strong measures to encourage and protect whistleblowers, but without offering whistleblower rewards, rejecting the US model.

==Rule 9(b) circuit split==

Under Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, allegations of fraud or mistake must be pleaded with particularity. All appeals courts to have addressed the issue of whether Rule 9(b) pleading standards apply to qui tam actions have held that the heightened standard applies. The Fifth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Eighth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit have all found that plaintiffs must allege specific false claims.

In 2010, the First Circuit decision in &quot;U.S. ex rel. Duxbury v. Ortho Biotech Prods., L.P.&quot;(2009) and the Eleventh Circuit ruling in &quot;U.S. ex rel. Hopper v. Solvay Pharms., Inc.&quot;(2009) were both appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court denied &quot;certiorari&quot; for both cases, however, declining to resolve the divergent appeals court decisions.

==&quot;ACLU et al. v. Holder&quot;==

In 2009, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Government Accountability Project (GAP) and OMB Watch filed suit against the Department of Justice challenging the constitutionality of the &quot;seal provisions&quot; of the FCA that require the whistleblower and the court to keep lawsuits confidential for at least 60 days. The plaintiffs argued that the requirements infringe the First Amendment rights of the public and the whistleblower, and that they violate the separation of powers, since courts are not free to release the documents until the executive branch acts. The government moved for dismissal, and the district court granted that motion in 2009. The plaintiffs appealed, and in 2011 their appeal was denied.
==&quot;U.S. ex rel. Clarissa Zafirov v. Florida Medical Associates&quot;==
In September 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida ruled that the FCA &quot;qui tam&quot; provision violates the Appointments Clause of Article II of the U.S. Constitution. Clarissa Zafirov filed a lawsuit under the FCA in May 2019, alleging her employer and other defendants committed Medicare fraud by misrepresenting patients&#x27; conditions to the federal government. The court dismissed Zafirov’s case with prejudice, finding that &quot;qui tam&quot; relators act as self-appointed special prosecutors seeking damages for the federal government without proper appointment by the president, a department head, or a court. Zafirov and the Department of Justice have appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

==Examples==

In 2004, the billing groups associated with the University of Washington agreed to pay $35 million to resolve civil claims brought by whistleblower Mark Erickson, a former compliance officer, under the False Claims Act. The settlement, approved by the UW Board of Regents, resolved claims that they systematically overbilled Medicaid and Medicare and that employees destroyed documents to hide the practice. The fraud settlement, the largest against a teaching hospital since the University of Pennsylvania agreed to pay $30 million in 1995, ended a five-year investigation that resulted in guilty pleas from two prominent doctors. The whistleblower was awarded $7.25M.

In 2010, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson agreed to pay over $81 million in civil and criminal penalties to resolve allegations in a FCA suit filed by two whistleblowers. The suit alleged that Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OMJPI) acted improperly concerning the marketing, promotion and sale of the anti-convulsant drug Topamax. Specifically, the suit alleged that OMJPI &quot;illegally marketed Topamax by, among other things, promoting the sale and use of Topamax for a variety of psychiatric conditions other than those for which its use was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, (i.e., &quot;off-label&quot; uses).&quot; It also states that &quot;certain of these uses were not medically accepted indications for which State Medicaid programs provided coverage&quot; and that as a result &quot;OMJPI knowingly caused false or fraudulent claims for Topamax to be submitted to, or caused purchase by, certain federally funded healthcare programs.

In response to a complaint from whistleblower Jerry H. Brown II, the US Government filed suit against Maersk for overcharging for shipments to US forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. In a settlement announced on 3 January 2012, the company agreed to pay $31.9 million in fines and interest, but made no admission of wrongdoing. Brown was entitled to $3.6 million of the settlement.

The largest healthcare fraud settlement in history was made by GlaxoSmithKline in 2012 when it paid a total of $3 billion to resolve four qui tam lawsuits brought under the False Claims Act and related criminal charges. The claims include allegations Glaxo engaged in off-label marketing and paid kickbacks to doctors to prescribe certain drugs, including Paxil, Wellbutrin and Advair.

In 2013, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc., a pharmaceutical company acquired by Pfizer, Inc. in 2009, paid $490.9 million to resolve its criminal and civil liability arising from the unlawful marketing of its drug Rapamune for uses that were not FDA-approved and potentially harmful.

In 2014, CareFusion paid $40.1 million to settle allegations of violating the False Claims Act by promoting off label use of its products in the case United States ex rel. Kirk v. CareFusion et al., No. 10-2492. The government alleged that CareFusion promoted the sale of its drug ChloraPrep for uses that were not approved by the FDA. ChloraPrep is the commercial name under which CareFusion produced the drug chlorhexidine, used to clean the skin before surgery. In 2017, this case was called into question and was under review by the DOJ because the lead attorney for the DOJ serving as Assistant Attorney General in the case, Jeffery Wertkin, was arrested by the FBI on January 31, 2017, for allegedly attempting to sell a copy of a complaint in a secret whistleblower suit that was under seal.

In 2017, bio-pharmaceutical giant Celgene Corporation paid $240 million to settle allegations it sold and marketed its drugs Thalomid and Revlimid off-label in &quot;U.S. ex rel. Brown v. Celgene&quot;, CV 10-03165 (RK) (C.D. Cal.).

In 2021, A South Carolina pain management company was ordered to pay $140 million under the False Claims Act after a judge in U.S. district court found it in default after fraud schemes.
