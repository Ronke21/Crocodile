<text>Gurmukhī ( , ) is an abugida developed from the Laṇḍā scripts, standardized and used by the second Sikh guru, Guru Angad (1504–1552). Commonly regarded as a Sikh script, Gurmukhi is used in Punjab, India as the official script of the Punjabi language.

The primary scripture of Sikhism, the Guru Granth Sahib, is written in Gurmukhī, in various dialects and languages often subsumed under the generic title &quot;Sant Bhasha&quot; or &quot;saint language&quot;, in addition to other languages like Persian and various phases of Indo-Aryan languages.

Modern Gurmukhī has thirty-five original letters, hence its common alternative term &quot;paintī&quot; or &quot;the thirty-five&quot;, plus six additional consonants, nine vowel diacritics, two diacritics for nasal sounds, one diacritic that geminates consonants and three subscript characters.

==History and development==
The Gurmukhī script is generally believed to have roots in the Proto-Sinaitic alphabet by way of the Brahmi script, which developed further into the Northwestern group (Sharada, or Śāradā, and its descendants, including Landa and Takri), the Central group (Nagari and its descendants, including Devanagari, Gujarati and Modi) and the Eastern group (evolved from Siddhaṃ, including Bangla, Tibetan, and some Nepali scripts), as well as several prominent writing systems of Southeast Asia and Sinhala in Sri Lanka, in addition to scripts used historically in Central Asia for extinct languages like Saka and Tocharian. Gurmukhi is derived from Sharada in the Northwestern group, of which it is the only major surviving member, with full modern currency.
Notable features include:
* It is an abugida in which all consonants have an inherent vowel, . Diacritics, which can appear above, below, before or after the consonant they are applied to, are used to change the inherent vowel.
* When they appear at the beginning of a syllable, vowels are written as independent letters.
* To form consonant clusters, Gurmukhi uniquely affixes subscript letters at the bottom of standard characters, rather than using the true conjunct symbols used by other scripts, which merge parts of each letter into a distinct character of its own.
* Punjabi is a tonal language with three tones. These are indicated in writing using the formerly voiced aspirated consonants (&quot;gh&quot;, &quot;dh&quot;, &quot;bh&quot;, etc.) and the intervocalic &quot;h&quot;. 

Gurmukhi evolved in cultural and historical circumstances notably different from other regional scripts, for the purpose of recording scriptures of Sikhism, a far less Sanskritized cultural tradition than others of the subcontinent. This independence from the Sanskritic model allowed it the freedom to evolve unique orthographical features. These include: 
*Three basic bearer vowels, integrated into the traditional Gurmukhi character set, using the vowel diacritics to write independent vowels, instead of distinctly separate characters for each of these vowels as in other scripts; 
*a drastic reduction in the number and importance of conjunct characters (similar to Brahmi, the letters of which Gurmukhi letters have remained more similar to than those of Nagari have, and characteristic of Northwestern abugidas);
*a unique standard ordering of characters that somewhat diverges from the traditional &quot;vargiya&quot;, or Sanskritic, ordering of characters, including vowels and fricatives being placed in front; 
*the recognition of Indo-Aryan phonological history through the omission of characters representing the sibilants and , retaining only the letters representing sounds of the spoken language of the time; these sibilants were naturally lost in most modern Indo-Aryan languages, though such characters were often retained in their respective consonant inventories as placeholders and archaisms while being mispronounced. These sibilants were often variously reintroduced through later circumstances, as was to Gurmukhi, necessitating a new glyph;
*the development of distinct new letters for sounds better reflecting the vernacular language spoken during the time of its development (e.g. for , and the sound shift that merged Sanskrit and /kʰ/ to Punjabi /kʰ/); 
*a gemination diacritic, a unique feature among native subcontinental scripts, which serve to indicate the preserved Middle Indo-Aryan geminates distinctive of Punjabi; 
and other features.
From the 10th century onwards, regional differences started to appear between the Sharada script used in Punjab, the Hill States (partly Himachal Pradesh) and Kashmir. Sharada proper was eventually restricted to very limited ceremonial use in Kashmir, as it grew increasingly unsuitable for writing the Kashmiri language. With the last known inscription dating to 1204 C.E., the early 13th century marks a milestone in the development of Sharada. The regional variety in Punjab continued to evolve from this stage through the 14th century; during this period it starts to appear in forms closely resembling Gurmukhī and other Landa scripts. By the 15th century, Sharada had evolved so considerably that epigraphists denote the script at this point by a special name, &quot;Dēvāśēṣa&quot;. Tarlochan Singh Bedi (1999) prefers the name &quot;prithamă gurmukhī&quot;, or Proto-Gurmukhī. It was through its recording in Gurmukhi that knowledge of the pronunciation and grammar of the Old Punjabi language (c. 10th–16th century) was preserved for modern philologists.

The Sikh gurus adopted Proto-Gurmukhī to write the Guru Granth Sahib, the religious scriptures of the Sikhs. The Takri alphabet developed through the &quot;Dēvāśēṣa&quot; stage of the Sharada script from the 14th-18th centuries and is found mainly in the Hill States such as Chamba, Himachal Pradesh and surrounding areas, where it is called Chambeali. In Jammu Division, it developed into Dogri, which was a &quot;highly imperfect&quot; script later consciously influenced in part by Gurmukhi during the late 19th century, possibly to provide it an air of authority by having it resemble scripts already established in official and literary capacities, though not displacing Takri. The local Takri variants got the status of official scripts in some of the Punjab Hill States, and were used for both administrative and literary purposes until the 19th century. After 1948, when Himachal Pradesh was established as an administrative unit, the local Takri variants were replaced by Devanagari.
Meanwhile, the mercantile scripts of Punjab known as the Laṇḍā scripts were normally not used for literary purposes. &quot;Laṇḍā&quot; means alphabet &quot;without tail&quot;, implying that the script did not have vowel symbols. In Punjab, there were at least ten different scripts classified as Laṇḍā, Mahajani being the most popular. The Laṇḍā scripts were used for household and trade purposes. In contrast to Laṇḍā, the use of vowel diacritics was made obligatory in Gurmukhī for increased accuracy and precision, due to the difficulties involved in deciphering words without vowel signs.

In the following epochs, Gurmukhī became the primary script for the literary writings of the Sikhs. Playing a significant role in Sikh faith and tradition, it expanded from its original use for Sikh scriptures and developed its own orthographical rules, spreading widely under the Sikh Empire and used by Sikh kings and chiefs of Punjab for administrative purposes. Also playing a major role in consolidating and standardizing the Punjabi language, it served as the main medium of literacy in Punjab and adjoining areas for centuries when the earliest schools were attached to &quot;gurdwaras&quot;. The first natively produced grammars of the Punjabi language were written in the 1860s in Gurmukhi. The Singh Sabha Movement of the late 19th century, a movement to revitalize Sikh institutions which had declined during colonial rule after the fall of the Sikh Empire, also advocated for the usage of the Gurmukhi script for mass media, with print media publications and Punjabi-language newspapers established in the 1880s. Later in the 20th century, after the struggle of the Punjabi Suba movement, from the founding of modern India in the 1940s to the 1960s, the script was given the authority as the official state script of the Punjab, India, where it is used in all spheres of culture, arts, education, and administration, with a firmly established common and secular character. It is one of the official scripts of the Indian Republic, and is currently the 14th most used script in the world.

===Etymology===

The prevalent view among Punjabi linguists is that as in the early stages the Gurmukhī letters were primarily used by the Guru&#x27;s followers, &quot;gurmukhs&quot; (literally, those who face, or follow, the Guru, as opposed to a &quot;manmukh&quot;); the script thus came to be known as &quot;gurmukhī&quot;, &quot;the script of those guided by the Guru.&quot; Guru Angad is credited in the Sikh tradition with the creation and standardization of Gurmukhi script from earlier Śāradā-descended scripts native to the region. It is now the standard writing script for the Punjabi language in India. The original Sikh scriptures and most of the historic Sikh literature have been written in the Gurmukhi script.

Although the word Gurmukhī has been commonly translated as &quot;from the Mouth of the Guru&quot;, the term used for the Punjabi script has somewhat different connotations. This usage of the term may have gained currency from the use of the script to record the utterances of the Sikh Gurus as scripture, which were often referred to as Gurmukhī, or from the &quot;mukhă&quot; (face, or mouth) of the Gurus. Consequently, the script that was used to write the resulting scripture may have also been designated with the same name.

The name for the Perso–Arabic alphabet for the Punjabi language, &quot;Shahmukhi&quot;, was modeled on the term &quot;Gurmukhi&quot;.

==Characters==
===Letters===

The Gurmukhī alphabet contains thirty-five base letters (&quot;akkhară&quot;), traditionally arranged in seven rows of five letters each. The first three letters, or &quot;mātarā vāhakă&quot; (&quot;vowel bearer&quot;), are distinct because they form the basis for independent vowels and are not consonants, or &quot;vianjană&quot;, like the remaining letters are, and except for the second letter &quot;aiṛā&quot; are never used on their own; see for further details. The pair of fricatives, or &quot;mūlă vargă&quot; (&quot;base class&quot;), share the row, which is followed by the next five sets of consonants, with the consonants in each row being homorganic, the rows arranged from the back (velars) to the front (labials) of the mouth, and the letters in the grid arranged by place and manner of articulation. The arrangement, or &quot;varṇămāllā&quot;, is completed with the &quot;antimă ṭollī&quot;, literally &quot;ending group.&quot; The names of most of the consonants are based on their reduplicative phonetic values, and the &quot;varṇămāllā&quot; is as follows:
The nasal letters ਙ &quot;ṅaṅṅā&quot; and ਞ &quot;ñaññā&quot; have become marginal as independent consonants in modern Gurmukhi. The sounds they represent occur most often as allophones of [] in clusters with velars and palatals respectively.

The pronunciation of ਵ can vary allophonically between preceding front vowels, and elsewhere.

The most characteristic feature of the Punjabi language is its tone system. The script has no separate symbol for tones, but they correspond to the tonal consonants that once represented voiced aspirates as well as older *&quot;h&quot;. To differentiate between consonants, the Punjabi tonal consonants of the fourth column, ਘ &quot;kà&quot;, ਝ &quot;cà&quot;, ਢ &quot;ṭà&quot;, ਧ &quot;tà&quot;, and ਭ &quot;pà&quot;, are often transliterated in the way of the voiced aspirate consonants &quot;gha&quot;, &quot;jha&quot;, &quot;ḍha&quot;, &quot;dha&quot;, and &quot;bha&quot; respectively, although Punjabi lacks these sounds. Tones in Punjabi can be either rising, neutral, or falling: 
*When the tonal letter is in onset positions, as in the pronunciation of the names of the Gurmukhī letters, it produces the falling tone on the syllable nucleus, indicated by a grave accent (◌̀). 
*When the tonal letter is in syllabic coda positions, the tone on the syllable nucleus is rising, indicated by an acute accent (◌́).
*When the tonal letter is in intervocalic positions, after a short vowel and before a long vowel, the following vowel has a falling tone. Between two short vowels, the tonal letter produces a rising tone on the preceding vowel.
The letters now always represent unaspirated consonants, and are unvoiced in onset positions and voiced elsewhere.

====Supplementary letters====
In addition to the 35 original letters, there are six supplementary consonants in official usage, referred to as the &quot;navīnă ṭollī&quot; or &quot;navīnă vargă&quot;, meaning &quot;new group&quot;, created by placing a dot (&quot;bindī&quot;) at the foot (&quot;pairă&quot;) of the consonant to create &quot;pairĭ bindī&quot; consonants. These are not present in the Guru Granth Sahib or old texts. These are used most often for loanwords, though not exclusively, and their usage is not always obligatory:

The letter ਸ਼, already in use by the time of the earliest Punjabi grammars produced, along with ਜ਼ and ਲ਼, enabled the previously unmarked distinction of /s/ and the well-established phoneme /ʃ/, which is used even in native echo doublets e.g. &quot;rō̆ṭṭī-śō̆ṭṭī&quot; &quot;stuff to eat&quot;; the loansounds &quot;f&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, and &quot;ġ&quot; as distinct phonemes are less well-established, decreasing in that order and often dependent on exposure to Hindi-Urdu norms.

The character ਲ਼ (&quot;ḷa&quot;), the only character not representing a fricative consonant, was only recently officially added to the Gurmukhī alphabet. It was not a part of the traditional orthography, as the distinctive phonological difference between /lə/ and /ɭə/, while both native sounds, was not reflected in the script, and its inclusion is still not currently universal. Previous usage of another glyph to represent this sound, [ਲ੍ਰ], has also been attested. The letters ਲ਼ &quot;ḷa&quot;, like ਙ &quot;ṅ&quot;, ਙ &quot;ṅ&quot;, ਣ &quot;ṇ&quot;, and ੜ &quot;ṛ&quot;, do not occur word-initially, except in some cases their names.

Other characters, like the more recent [ਕ਼] //, are also on rare occasion used unofficially, chiefly for transliterating old writings in Persian and Urdu, the knowledge of which is less relevant in modern times.

====Subscript letters====

Three &quot;subscript&quot; letters, called &quot;duttă akkhară&quot; (&quot;joint letters&quot;) or &quot;pairī̃ akkhară&quot; (&quot;letters at the feet&quot;) are utilised in modern Gurmukhī: forms of ਹ &quot;ha&quot;, ਰ &quot;ra&quot;, and ਵ &quot;va&quot;.

The subscript ਰ &quot;ra&quot; and ਵ &quot;va&quot; are used to make consonant clusters and behave similarly; subjoined ਹ &quot;ha&quot; introduces tone.

In addition to the three standard subscript letters, another subscript character representing the subjoined /j/, the &quot;yakaśă&quot; or &quot;pairī̃ yayyā&quot; ( ੵ U+0A75), is utilized specifically in archaized &quot;sahaskritī&quot;-style writings in Sikh scripture, where it is found 268 times for word forms and inflections from older phases of Indo-Aryan, as in the examples ਰਖੵਾ /ɾəkʰːjaː/ &quot;(to be) protected&quot;, ਮਿਥੵੰਤ /mɪt̪ʰjən̪t̪ə/ &quot;deceiving&quot;, ਸੰਸਾਰਸੵ /sənsaːɾəsjə/ &quot;of the world&quot;, ਭਿਖੵਾ /pɪ̀kʰːjaː/ &quot;(act of) begging&quot;, etc. There is also a conjunct form of the letter &quot;yayyā&quot;, ਯ→੍ਯ, a later form, which functions similarly to the &quot;yakaśă&quot;, and is used exclusively for Sanskrit borrowings, and even then rarely. In addition, miniaturized versions of the letters ਚ, ਟ, ਤ, and ਨ are also found in limited use as subscript letters in Sikh scripture.

Only the subjoined /ɾə/ and /hə/ are commonly used; usage of the subjoined /ʋə/ and conjoined forms of /jə/, already rare, is increasingly scarce in modern contexts.

===Vowel diacritics===
To express vowels (singular, &quot;sură&quot;), Gurmukhī, as an abugida, makes use of obligatory diacritics called &quot;lagā̃&quot;. Gurmukhī is similar to Brahmi scripts in that all consonants are followed by an inherent schwa sound. This inherent vowel sound can be changed by using dependent vowel signs which attach to a bearing consonant. In some cases, dependent vowel signs cannot be used – at the beginning of a word or syllable for instance – and so an independent vowel character is used instead.

Independent vowels are constructed using the three vowel-bearing characters: ੳ &quot;ūṛā&quot; , ਅ &quot;aiṛā&quot;, and ੲ &quot;īṛī&quot;. With the exception of &quot;aiṛā&quot; (which in isolation represents the vowel ), the bearer vowels are never used without additional vowel diacritics.

Vowels are always pronounced after the consonant they are attached to. Thus, &quot;siā̀rī&quot; is always written to the left, but pronounced after the character on the right. When constructing the independent vowel for , &quot;ūṛā&quot; takes an irregular form instead of using the usual &quot;hōṛā&quot;.

====Orthography====
Gurmukhi orthography prefers vowel sequences over the use of semivowels (&quot;y&quot; or &quot;w&quot;) intervocally and in syllable nuclei, as in the words ਦਿਸਾਇਆ &quot;disāiā&quot; &quot;caused to be visible&quot; rather than &quot;disāyā&quot;, ਦਿਆਰ &quot;diāră&quot; &quot;cedar&quot; rather than &quot;dyāră&quot;, and ਸੁਆਦ &quot;suādă&quot; &quot;taste&quot; rather than &quot;swādă&quot;, permitting vowels in hiatus.

In terms of tone orthography, the short vowels [ɪ] and [ʊ], when paired with [h] to yield /ɪh/ and /ʊh/, represent [é] and [ó] with high tones respectively, e.g. ਕਿਹੜਾ &quot;kihṛā&quot; () &#x27;which?&#x27; ਦੁਹਰਾ &quot;duhrā&quot; () &quot;repeat, reiterate, double.&quot; The compounding of [əɦ] with [ɪ] or [ʊ] yield [ɛ́ː] and [ɔ́ː] respectively, e.g. ਮਹਿੰਗਾ &quot;mahingā&quot; () &quot;expensive&quot;, ਵਹੁਟੀ &quot;vahuṭṭī&quot; () &quot;bride.&quot;

===Other signs===
The diacritics for gemination and nasalization are together referred to as ਲਗਾਖਰ &quot;lagākkhară&quot; (&quot;applied letters&quot;).

====Gemination====
The diacritic ਅੱਧਕ &quot;áddakă&quot; ( ੱ ) indicates that the following consonant is geminated, and is placed above the consonant preceding the geminated one. Consonant length is distinctive in the Punjabi language and the use of this diacritic can change the meaning of a word, as below:

It has not been standardized to be written in all instances of gemination; there is a strong tendency, especially in rural dialects, to also geminate consonants following a long vowel (/a:/, /e:/, /i:/, /o:/, /u:/, /ɛ:/, /ɔː/, which triggers shortening in these vowels) in the penult of a word, e.g. ਔਖਾ &quot;aukkhā&quot; &quot;difficult&quot;, ਕੀਤੀ &quot;kī̆ttī&quot; &quot;did&quot;, ਪੋਤਾ &quot;pō̆ttā&quot; &quot;grandson&quot;, ਪੰਜਾਬੀ &quot;panjā̆bbī&quot; &quot;Punjabi&quot;, ਹਾਕ &quot;hākă&quot; &quot;call, shout&quot;, but plural ਹਾਕਾਂ &quot;hā̆kkā̃&quot;.
Except in this case, where this unmarked gemination is often etymologically rooted in archaic forms, and has become phonotactically regular, the usage of the &quot;áddakă&quot; is obligatory.

It is also sometimes used to indicate second-syllable stress, e.g. ਬਚਾੱ &quot;ba&#x27;cā&quot;, &quot;save&quot;.

====Nasalisation====
The diacritics ਟਿੱਪੀ &quot;ṭippī&quot; ( ੰ ) and ਬਿੰਦੀ &quot;bindī&quot; ( ਂ ) are used for producing a nasal phoneme depending on the following obstruent or a nasal vowel at the end of a word. All short vowels are nasalized using &quot;ṭippī&quot; and all long vowels are nasalized using &quot;bindī&quot; except for &quot;dulaiṅkaṛă&quot; ( ੂ ), which uses &quot;ṭippī&quot; instead. 

Older texts may follow other conventions.

====Vowel suppression====

The ਹਲੰਤ &quot;halantă&quot;, or ਹਲੰਦ &quot;halandă&quot;, ( ੍ U+0A4D) character is not used when writing Punjabi in Gurmukhī. However, it may occasionally be used in Sanskritised text or in dictionaries for extra phonetic information. When it is used, it represents the suppression of the inherent vowel.

The effect of this is shown below:

:ਕ – 

:ਕ੍ – 

====Punctuation====

The &quot;ḍaṇḍī&quot; (।) is used in Gurmukhi to mark the end of a sentence. A doubled &quot;ḍaṇḍī&quot;, or &quot;doḍaṇḍī&quot; (॥) marks the end of a verse.

The &quot;visarga&quot; symbol (ਃ U+0A03) is used very occasionally in Gurmukhī. It can represent an abbreviation, as the period is used in English, though the period for abbreviation, like commas, exclamation points, and other Western punctuation, is freely used in modern Gurmukhī.

===Numerals===
Gurmukhī has its own set of digits, which function exactly as in other versions of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system. These are used extensively in older texts. In modern contexts, they are sometimes replaced by standard Western Arabic numerals.

*In some Punjabi dialects, the word for three is ਤ੍ਰੈ &quot;trai&quot; ().

===Glyphs===

The scriptural symbol for the Sikh term ( U+0A74) is formed from (&quot;1&quot;) and (&quot;ō&quot;).

==Palaeography==

=== Vowels ===
In the earliest Gurmukhi texts, interpuncts in the form of a dot were used to mark a long &quot;a&quot; vowel. This would later develop into a &quot;kannā&quot; mark, where the initially used interpunct vowel marker becoming a longer mark that starts at the top of the line where the words are connected and moving down to cover the top half of the letter space. Shorter kanna marks are indicative of a work dating to an earlier period.

=== Spacing ===
Before the 1970s, Gurbani and other Sikh scriptures were written in the traditional &quot;scriptio continua&quot; method of writing the Gurmukhi script known as ਲੜੀਵਾਰ &quot;laṛīvāră&quot;, where there were no spacing between words in the texts. This is opposed to the comparatively more recent method of writing in Gurmukhi known as &quot;padă chēdă&quot;, which breaks the words by inserting spacing between them.

First line of the Guru Granth Sahib, the &quot;Mul Mantar,&quot; in &quot;laṛīvāră&quot; (continuous form) and &quot;padă chēdă&quot; (spaced form):

&quot;laṛīvāră:&quot; ੴਸਤਿਨਾਮੁਕਰਤਾਪੁਰਖੁਨਿਰਭਉਨਿਰਵੈਰੁਅਕਾਲਮੂਰਤਿਅਜੂਨੀਸੈਭੰਗੁਰਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ॥

&quot;padă chēdă:&quot; ੴ ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਨਿਰਭਉ ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ ਅਕਾਲ ਮੂਰਤਿ ਅਜੂਨੀ ਸੈਭੰ ਗੁਰ ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ ॥

Transliteration: &quot;ikku ōaṅkāru sati nāmu karatā purakhu nirapàu niravairu akāla mūrati ajūnī saipàṅ gura prasādi&quot;

=== Styles ===

Various historical styles and fonts, or ਸ਼ੈਲੀ &quot;śailī&quot;, of Gurmukhi script have evolved and been identified. A list of some of them is as follows:

# &quot;purātana&quot; (&quot;old&quot;) style
# &quot;ardha śikastā&quot; (&quot;half-broken&quot;) style
# &quot;śikastā&quot; (&quot;broken&quot;) style (including &quot;Anandpur Lipi&quot;)
# &quot;Kaśmīrī&quot; style
# &quot;Damdamī&quot; style

==Unicode==
Gurmukhī script was added to the Unicode Standard in October 1991 with the release of version 1.0.

Many sites still use proprietary fonts that convert Latin ASCII codes to Gurmukhī glyphs.

The Unicode block for Gurmukhī is U+0A00–U+0A7F:
==Digitization==
===Manuscripts===

Panjab Digital Library has taken up digitization of all available manuscripts of Gurmukhī Script. The script has been in formal use since the 1500s, and a lot of literature written within this time period is still traceable. Panjab Digital Library has digitized over 45 million pages from different manuscripts and most of them are available online.

===Internet domain names===
Punjabi University Patiala has developed label generation rules for validating international domain names for internet in Gurmukhi.

<text>Geneva College is a private Christian college in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1848, in Northwood, Ohio, the college moved to its present location in 1880, where it continues to educate a student body of about 1400 traditional undergraduates in over 30 majors, as well as graduate students in a handful of master&#x27;s programs. The only undergraduate institution affiliated with the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America (RPCNA), the college&#x27;s undergraduate core curriculum emphasizes the humanities and the formation of a Reformed Christian worldview.

==History==

Geneva College was founded in 1848 in Northwood, Ohio, by John Black Johnston, a minister of the RPCNA. The college was founded as &quot;Geneva Hall&quot;, and was named after the Swiss center of the Reformed faith movement. After briefly closing during the American Civil War, the college continued operating in Northwood until 1880. By that time, the college leadership had begun a search for alternate locations that were closer to urban areas. After considering several locations in the Midwest, the denomination chose the College Hill neighborhood of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. The college constructed its current campus on land donated by the Harmony Society. Old Main, the oldest building on campus, was completed in 1881.

The Rapp Technical Design Center was completed in 2002. A major project to reroute Pennsylvania Route 18, which runs through the campus, was completed in November 2007. Improvements to Reeves Stadium and the construction of a campus entrance and pedestrian mall were completed in 2009.

===Presidents===
==Administration==

Two bodies oversee the administration of the college, the Board of Corporators and the Board of Trustees; while the Corporators are the legal owners of the college, in practice most authority is delegated to the Trustees, who are elected by the Corporators. Both Boards drafted the philosophical basis on which the college rests, known as the Foundational Concepts of Higher Education. The RPCNA still takes an active sponsorship and oversight role in the college: the college president, chaplain, and chairman of the Department of Biblical Studies must be members of the RPCNA, and all members of the Board of Corporators and the majority of the Board of Trustees must be RPCNA members. All professors and lecturers in the Department of Biblical Studies must subscribe to the Westminster Confession of Faith, and all full-time faculty and staff members must submit a written statement confessing faith in Jesus Christ and the Christian religion.

The university was granted an exception to Title IX in 2014 which allows it to legally discriminate against LGBT students.

==Academics==

Geneva offers undergraduate degree programs in the arts and sciences, such as elementary education, business, engineering, student ministry, biology, and psychology. In 2006, the Educational Testing Service (ETS) rated the Business and Accounting undergraduates in the 95th percentile amongst American colleges.

Historically, Geneva offered a Degree Completion Program (DCP) for degrees in Human Resource Management, Community Ministry or Organizational Development for adult students mainly at off-campus locations. Geneva also established the Center for Urban Theological Studies in Philadelphia and has sister colleges in Taiwan (Christ College) and South Korea (Chong Shin College and Theological Seminary).

Geneva also offers graduates studies in several fields and degrees including a Master of Business Administration, Master of Arts in Higher Education, Master of Arts in Counseling, and a Master of Science in Cybersecurity.

Geneva established the Center for Technology Development in 1986 for providing research, prototyping and technical support to local industries and entrepreneurs. The center was awarded first prize in the Consolidated Natural Gas Company&#x27;s Annual Award of Excellence competition in 1990.

=== Online Courses ===
Geneva offers online degree programs for adult students. Currently, Geneva offers online Bachelor of Professional Studies degrees in Child and Family Services, Human Resources, Management, and Organization Leadership. The College also offers an online Associate&#x27;s Degree in general studies.

Geneva partners with Portage Learning to offer online college courses on their platform. These online college courses are offered to visiting students seeking to transfer courses to their home institution where they intend to pursue a degree. Courses completed prior to matriculation may be used by Geneva students to fulfill degree requirements.

=== Affiliations and accreditations ===
Geneva College is a member institution of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities, Council of Independent Colleges, and National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. Accreditations include the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs, and the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs. The chemistry degree is certified by the American Chemical Society.

==Athletics==

Geneva&#x27;s sports teams are called the Golden Tornadoes. The college is a dual member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III and National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA) Division I. The Golden Tornadoes compete as a member of the Presidents&#x27; Athletic Conference. Geneva was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) for many years and competed in the now-defunct American Mideast Conference. Geneva joined the NCAA as a provisional member in 2007 and during the transition process was not eligible for post season play or conference Player of the Week honors until gaining membership in July 2011.

The school offers a range of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s varsity sports, including football, baseball, softball, basketball, volleyball, track and field, cross country, tennis, and soccer.

Geneva has also offered rugby as a club sport since 1994.

===Football===

Football competition began in 1890 under head coach William McCracken. Over the years, the football team has amassed an all-time record of 496 wins, 437 losses, and 48 ties with five appearances in the Victory Bowl. The current football coach is Geno DeMarco.

==Culture and traditions==
Students must attend a designated number of weekly college-sponsored chapels to qualify for graduation. Alcohol is banned from the campus, and tobacco use is restricted from the entire campus. Greek letter fraternities and sororities are not permitted.

One of the earliest college basketball games in the United States occurred at Geneva College on April 8, 1893, when the Geneva College Covenanters defeated the New Brighton YMCA. Geneva commemorates this event through the athletic slogan of &quot;The Birthplace of College Basketball&quot;. Geneva also has one of the oldest basketball courts in collegiate sports in the Johnston Gymnasium.

Geneva was founded by Scottish and Scots-Irish immigrants. Many names of campus buildings and areas bear Scottish names:
*The main meeting area of the Student Center is called &quot;Skye Lounge&quot; after the Isle of Skye.
*The library on campus is named &quot;McCartney Library&quot; after Dr. Clarence E. Macartney, the son of Scottish immigrant parents.
*The restaurant-style eating area is called &quot;The Brig&quot;, short for Brigadoon, commemorating a play about a mythical Highland village.

Geneva sports teams were nicknamed the &quot;Covenanters&quot; until the 1950s. Members of the RPCNA are sometimes referred to as Covenanters because the denomination traces its roots to the Covenanting tradition of Reformation era Scotland. The modern sports nickname of &quot;Golden Tornadoes&quot; commemorates the &quot;Golden Tornado&quot; of May 11, 1914, when a major tornado struck the college, most notably taking the gold colored roof from the top of Old Main, which was the origin of the associated color. Although the storm caused significant damage to the campus, there were no serious injuries. College students and faculty rejoiced at what they believed was a sign of God&#x27;s mercy.

Geneva&#x27;s traditional sports rivalry is with Westminster College in nearby New Wilmington, Pennsylvania.

Homosexual behavior is prohibited in the student handbook; students must confess and change their behavior or be suspended.

===Residence halls===

Six dormitories — Clarke, Geneva Arms, McKee, Memorial, Pearce, and Young — house resident students. Geneva Arms and Young are apartment-style options divided into women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s wings. The college also owns a few smaller houses nearby campus, primarily for upperclassmen, that are available depending on residential need.

==Legal actions==
===CareerLink===
On December 15, 2006, the college filed a federal lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, alleging that a decision by the state to block the college from participating in the state sponsored CareerLink job service amounted to a violation of the college&#x27;s First Amendment rights. Although the state argued that the college&#x27;s requirement that faculty and staff members subscribe to the Christian religion amounted to discrimination, the lawsuit was settled. Geneva&#x27;s right to access to CareerLink was restored and the college retains a statement on its employment applications stating &quot;Compliance with Geneva&#x27;s Christian views is considered a bona fide occupational qualification ... and will have a direct impact on employment consideration.&quot;

===Obamacare===
In 2012, the college sued the federal government over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (&quot;Obamacare&quot;) contraceptive mandate, which requires employers to provide health insurance coverage for their employees that includes contraception, which Geneva College &quot;considers abortion, abortifacients and embryo-harming pharmaceuticals&quot; and objects to on religious grounds. The college, represented by Alliance Defending Freedom in the litigation, prevailed in its case, obtaining a permanent injunction in 2018.

<doc id="13084" wikidata="Q189991" url="?curid=13084" title="Gorillaz">
<text>Gorillaz are a British virtual band created in 1998 by musician Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett, from London. The band primarily consists of four fictional members: (vocals, keyboards), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (guitar, keyboards, vocals) and Russel Hobbs (drums). Their universe is presented in media such as music videos, interviews, comic strips and short cartoons. Gorillaz&#x27;s music has featured collaborations with a wide range of featured artists, with Albarn as the only permanent musical contributor.

With Gorillaz, Albarn departed from the distinct Britpop sound of his band Blur, exploring a variety of musical styles including hip hop, electronic and world music. The band&#x27;s 2001 debut album, &quot;Gorillaz&quot;, which features dub, Latin and punk influences, went triple platinum in the UK and double platinum in Europe, with sales driven by the success of the lead single, &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;. Their second studio album, &quot;Demon Days&quot; (2005), went six times platinum in the UK, double platinum in the US, and spawned the successful lead single &quot;Feel Good Inc.&quot; The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Plastic Beach&quot; (2010), featured environmentalist themes, synth-pop elements and an expanded roster of featured artists. Their fourth album, &quot;The Fall&quot;, was recorded on the road during the Escape to Plastic Beach Tour and released on 25 December 2010.

In 2015, after over 10 years providing the voice of Russel, Remi Kabaka Jr. became a permanent music producer for the band. Their fifth album, &quot;Humanz&quot; (2017) was the band&#x27;s first in seven years and featured a wide array of guest artists, while its follow-up, &quot;The Now Now&quot; (2018), focused musically on Albarn. In 2020, Gorillaz started the &quot;Song Machine&quot; project, a music-based web series with episodes that consisted of standalone singles and accompanying music videos featuring different guests, which culminated with their seventh studio album, &quot;Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez&quot; (2020). The band&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Cracker Island&quot; (2023), met generally positive reviews as a refinement of their usual style.

Gorillaz has presented itself live in a variety of different ways throughout its history, such as hiding the touring band from the audience&#x27;s view in the early years of the project, projecting animated band members on stage via computer graphics and traditional live touring featuring a fully visible live band. They have won a Grammy Award, two MTV Video Music Awards, an NME Award and four MTV Europe Music Awards. They have also been nominated for 11 Brit Awards and won Best British Group at the 2018 Brit Awards. Gorillaz have sold over 27 million albums worldwide.

==History==
===Creation (1998–2000)===
Musician Damon Albarn and comic artist Jamie Hewlett met in 1990 when guitarist Graham Coxon, a fan of Hewlett&#x27;s work, asked him to interview Blur, which Albarn and Coxon had recently formed. The interview was published in &quot;Deadline&quot;, home of Hewlett&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Tank Girl&quot;. Hewlett initially thought Albarn was &quot;arsey, a wanker&quot;. Though Hewlett became acquaintances with the band, he and Albarn often clashed, especially after Hewlett began seeing Coxon&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Jane Oliver. Despite this, Albarn and Hewlett started sharing a flat on Westbourne Grove in London in 1997. Hewlett had recently broken up with Oliver and Albarn was at the end of his highly publicised relationship with Justine Frischmann of Elastica.

The idea to create Gorillaz came about when Albarn and Hewlett were watching MTV. Hewlett said, &quot;If you watch MTV for too long, it&#x27;s a bit like hell – there&#x27;s nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a virtual band, something that would be a comment on that.&quot; Albarn said: &quot;This was the beginning of the boy band sort of explosion... and it just felt so manufactured. And we were like, well let&#x27;s make a manufactured band but make it kind of interesting.&quot;

The band originally identified themselves as &quot;Gorilla&quot; and the first song they recorded was &quot;Ghost Train&quot;, which was later released as a B-side on their single &quot;Rock the House&quot;. The band&#x27;s visual style is thought to have evolved from &quot;The 16s&quot;, a rejected comic strip Hewlett conceived with &quot;Tank Girl&quot; co-creator Alan Martin.

Although not released under the Gorillaz name, Albarn has said that &quot;one of the first ever Gorillaz tunes&quot; was Blur&#x27;s 1997 single &quot;On Your Own&quot;, which was released for their fifth studio album &quot;Blur&quot;.

===&quot;Gorillaz&quot; (2001–2002)===
From 1998 to 2000, Albarn recorded Gorillaz&#x27; self-titled debut album at his newly opened Studio 13 in London as well as at Geejam Studios in Jamaica. The sessions resulted in the first Gorillaz release, the EP &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot;, released on 27 November 2000. This EP consisted mostly of tracks which later appeared on the album, and it also included the band&#x27;s first music video for &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot;, which introduced the virtual band members for the first time.

With &quot;Gorillaz&quot;, Albarn explored genres he had not explored with Blur, such as hip-hop, dub and Latin music, a process he described as liberating: &quot;One of the reasons I began Gorillaz is I had a lot of rhythms I never thought I could use with Blur. A lot of that stuff never really seemed to manifest itself in the music we made together as Blur.&quot;

Albarn began work on the album by himself, but eventually invited American hip-hop producer Dan &quot;the Automator&quot; Nakamura. He said: &quot;I called Dan the Automator in after I&#x27;d done more than half of it and felt it would benefit from having somebody else&#x27;s focus. So I just rang him and asked whether he was interested in helping me finish it off.&quot; Nakamura and Albarn had recently collaborated on &quot;Deltron 3030&quot;, the debut album by the hip-hop supergroup of the same name featuring rapper Del the Funky Homosapien and DJ Kid Koala, both of whom Nakamura recruited to assist in finishing Gorillaz material. Del featured on two tracks on the album, including the lead single &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;, while Kid Koala contributed turntables to various tracks. The album featured additional collaborations with Ibrahim Ferrer of Buena Vista Social Club, Miho Hatori of Cibo Matto and Tina Weymouth of Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club, representing a pattern of collaboration with a wide range of artists which later became a staple of Gorillaz.

&quot;Gorillaz&quot; was released on 26 March 2001 and was a major commercial success, debuting at No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 14 on the US Billboard 200, going on to sell over 7 million copies worldwide, powered by the success of the &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; single. The album was promoted with the singles &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;, &quot;19-2000&quot; and &quot;Rock the House&quot;, in addition to the previously released &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot;, with each single featuring a music video directed by Hewlett starring the virtual members. Hewlett also helmed the design of the band&#x27;s website, which was presented as an interactive tour of the band&#x27;s fictional &quot;Kong Studios&quot; home and recording studio, featuring interactive games and explorative elements. Following the release of the album, the band embarked on a brief tour of Europe, Japan and the United States to support the album in which a touring band featuring Albarn played completely obscured behind a giant screen on which Hewlett&#x27;s accompanying visuals were projected. The virtual band member&#x27;s voice actors were also present at some shows and spoke live to the audience to give the impression that the fictional band was present on stage. In later interviews, Albarn described the band&#x27;s first tour as difficult due to the limitations imposed by the band playing behind a screen: &quot;For someone who had just spent the last ten years out front being a frontman [with Blur], it was a really weird experience. And I have to say, some nights I just wanted to get a knife and just cut [the screen] and stick my head through.&quot; The album was followed by the B-sides compilation &quot;G-Sides&quot; released in December 2001.

On 7 December 2001, the band released the single &quot;911&quot;, a collaboration with hip hop group D12 (without Eminem) and singer Terry Hall of the Specials about the September 11 attacks. At the 2002 Brit Awards the virtual members of Gorillaz &quot;performed&quot; for the first time, appearing in 3D animation on four large screens along with rap accompaniment by Phi Life Cypher, a production which reportedly cost £300,000 to create. The band were nominated for four Brit Awards, including Best British Group, Best British Album and British Breakthrough Act, but did not win any awards.

On 1 July 2002, a remix album titled &quot;Laika Come Home&quot; was released, containing most of the tracks from &quot;Gorillaz&quot; remixed in dub and reggae style by the DJ group Spacemonkeyz. On 18 November 2002, the band released the DVD &quot;Phase One: Celebrity Take Down&quot;, which contained all of the band&#x27;s released visual content up to that point along with other extras.

After the success of the debut album, Albarn and Hewlett briefly explored the possibility of creating a Gorillaz theatrical film, but Hewlett claimed the duo later lost interest: &quot;We lost all interest in doing it as soon as we started meeting with studios and talking to these Hollywood executive types, we just weren&#x27;t on the same page. We said, fuck it, we&#x27;ll sit on the idea until we can do it ourselves, and maybe even raise the money ourselves.&quot;

===&quot;Demon Days&quot; (2005–2006)===
Albarn spent the majority of 2003 on tour with Blur in support of their newly released album &quot;Think Tank&quot;; however, upon completion of the tour, he decided to return to Gorillaz, reuniting with Hewlett to prepare for a second album. Hewlett explained that the duo chose to continue Gorillaz to prove that the project was not &quot;a gimmick&quot;: &quot;If you do it again, it&#x27;s no longer a gimmick, and if it works then we&#x27;ve proved a point.&quot; The result was &quot;Demon Days&quot;, released on 11 May 2005. The album was another major commercial success, debuting at No. 1 on the UK Albums Charts and No. 6 on the US Billboard 200, and has since gone six times platinum in the UK, double platinum in the United States, and triple platinum in Australia, outperforming sales of the first album and becoming the band&#x27;s most successful album to date. The album&#x27;s success was partially driven by the success of the lead single &quot;Feel Good Inc.&quot; featuring hip-hop group De La Soul, which topped &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Alternative Songs chart in the U.S. for eight consecutive weeks and was featured in a commercial for Apple&#x27;s iPod. The album was also supported by the later singles &quot;Dare&quot;, &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, and the double A-side &quot;Kids with Guns&quot; / &quot;El Mañana&quot;.

&quot;Demon Days&quot; found the band taking a darker tone, partially influenced by a train journey Albarn had taken with his family through impoverished rural China. Albarn described the album as a concept album: &quot;The whole album kind of tells the story of the night — staying up during the night — but it&#x27;s also an allegory. It&#x27;s what we&#x27;re living in basically, the world in a state of night.&quot; Believing that the album needed &quot;a slightly different approach&quot; compared to the first album, Albarn enlisted American producer Brian Burton, better known by his stage name Danger Mouse, to produce the album, whom Albarn praised as &quot;one of the best young producers in the world&quot; after hearing his 2004 mashup album &quot;The Grey Album&quot;. Burton felt he and Albarn had a high degree of affinity with each other, stating in an interview on the creation of the album: &quot;We never had any arguments. We even have that finish-each-other&#x27;s-sentences thing happening. There are a lot of the same influences between us, like Ennio Morricone and psychedelic pop-rock, but he has 10 years on me, so I have some catching up to do. Where he can school me on new wave and punk of the late &#x27;70s/early &#x27;80s, I can school him on a lot of hip-hop. We&#x27;re very competitive and pushed each other.&quot; Similar to the first album, &quot;Demon Days&quot; features collaborations with several different artists, including Bootie Brown, Shaun Ryder, Ike Turner, MF Doom (who was recording with Danger Mouse as Danger Doom at the time) and Martina Topley-Bird, among others.

 The band chose to forgo traditional live touring in support of &quot;Demon Days&quot;, instead limiting live performance during the album cycle to a five night residency in November 2005 at the Manchester Opera House billed as Demon Days Live. The concerts saw the band performing the album in full each night with most featured artists from the album present. Unlike the debut album&#x27;s tour, the touring band was visible on stage in view of the audience but obscured by lighting in such a way that only their silhouettes were visible, with a screen above the band displaying Hewlett&#x27;s visuals alongside each song. The residency was later repeated in April 2006 at New York City&#x27;s Apollo Theater and the Manchester performances were later released on DVD as &quot;Demon Days: Live at the Manchester Opera House&quot;. As part of their promotion of the album in Latin America, the band was interviewed in September 2005 on the live-action Mexican show &quot;Rebelde&quot;. This episode also included the Latin American premiere of the music video for &quot;Dare&quot;.

The virtual Gorillaz members &quot;performed&quot; at the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2005 and again at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2006, appearing to perform on stage via Musion Eyeliner technology. Albarn later expressed disappointment at the execution of the performance, citing the low volume level required so as to not disturb the technology: &quot;That was tough... They started and it was so quiet cause they&#x27;ve got this piece of film that you&#x27;ve got to pull over the stage so any bass frequencies would just mess up the illusion completely.&quot; At the Grammys, the band won Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for &quot;Feel Good Inc.&quot;, which was also nominated for Record of the Year. Albarn and Hewlett explored the idea of producing a full &quot;live holographic tour&quot; featuring the virtual Gorillaz appearing on stage with Musion Eyeliner technology after the Grammys performance, but the tour was ultimately never realised due to the tremendous expense and logistical issues that would have resulted.

In October 2006, the band released the book &quot;Rise of the Ogre&quot;. Presented as an autobiography of the band ostensibly written by the fictional members and expanding on the band&#x27;s fictional backstory and universe, the book was actually written by official Gorillaz script writer and live drummer Cass Browne and featured new artwork by Hewlett. Later the same month, the band released another DVD, &quot;Phase Two: Slowboat to Hades&quot;, compiling much of the band&#x27;s visual content from the album cycle. A second B-sides compilation, &quot;D-Sides&quot; was released in November 2007, featuring B-sides and remixes associated with &quot;Demon Days&quot; as well as unreleased tracks from the sessions for the album. In 2008, the documentary film &quot;Bananaz&quot; was released. Directed by Ceri Levy, the film documents the behind-the-scenes history of the band from 2000 to 2006.

===&quot;Plastic Beach&quot; and &quot;The Fall&quot; (2010–2012)===
Albarn and Hewlett&#x27;s next project together was the opera &quot;&quot; based on the classical Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, which premiered at the 2007 Manchester International Festival. While not officially a Gorillaz project, Albarn mentioned in an interview that the project was &quot;Gorillaz, really but we can&#x27;t call it that for legal reasons&quot;.

After completing work on &quot;Monkey&quot; in late 2007, Albarn and Hewlett began working on a new Gorillaz project entitled &quot;Carousel&quot;, described by Albarn as being about &quot;the mystical aspects of Britain&quot;. Hewlett described &quot;Carousel&quot; in a 2008 interview as &quot;even bigger and more difficult than &quot;Monkey&quot;... It&#x27;s sort of like a film but not with one narrative story. There&#x27;s many stories, told around a bigger story, set to music, and done in live action, animation, all different styles. Originally it was a film but now we think it&#x27;s a film and it&#x27;s a stage thing as well. Damon&#x27;s written around 70 songs for it, and I&#x27;ve got great plans for the visuals.&quot; The &quot;Carousel&quot; concept was eventually dropped with Albarn and Hewlett&#x27;s work evolving into the third Gorillaz studio album, &quot;Plastic Beach&quot;.

Drawing upon environmentalist themes, &quot;Plastic Beach&quot; was inspired by the idea of a &quot;secret floating island deep in the South Pacific... made up of the detritus, debris and washed up remnants of humanity&quot; inspired by marine pollution such as plastic that Albarn had found in a beach near one of his homes in Devon as well as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Unlike previous Gorillaz albums, Albarn made the decision to produce &quot;Plastic Beach&quot; by himself, with no co-producer. The album was recorded throughout 2008 and 2009 in London, New York City and Syria although production of the album was briefly interrupted so that Albarn could join Blur for a reunion tour in the summer of 2009, with Albarn explaining &quot;there&#x27;s no way you can do that and that [Blur and Gorillaz] at the same time.&quot; &quot;Plastic Beach&quot; saw Gorillaz move into a more electronic pop sound, with Albarn describing the album as &quot;the most pop record I&#x27;ve ever made&quot; and saying that he took special care to make the album&#x27;s lyrics and melodies clear and focused compared to previous albums. &quot;Plastic Beach&quot; also featured the largest cast of collaborators featured yet on a Gorillaz album, fulfilling Albarn&#x27;s goal of &quot;work[ing] with an incredibly eclectic, surprising cast of people&quot; including artists such as Snoop Dogg, Mos Def, Bobby Womack, Little Dragon, Lou Reed and Gruff Rhys among others, and also included orchestral contributions from Sinfonia Viva and the Syrian National Orchestra for Arabic Music. Albarn explained the expanded roster of featured artists represented his and Hewlett&#x27;s new vision of Gorillaz as a project, explaining in a July 2008 interview that &quot;Gorillaz now to us is not like four animated characters any more – it&#x27;s more like an organisation of people doing new projects... That&#x27;s my ideal model.&quot;

Released on 3 March 2010, &quot;Plastic Beach&quot; debuted at No. 2 on both the UK Albums Chart and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, the band&#x27;s highest placing debut chart position. The album was supported by the lead single &quot;Stylo&quot; featuring Mos Def and Bobby Womack released in January 2010 and the later singles &quot;On Melancholy Hill&quot; and &quot;Rhinestone Eyes&quot;. To promote the album, the band embarked on the Escape to Plastic Beach Tour, the band&#x27;s first world tour and also their first live performances in which the touring band performed fully in view of the audience on stage with no visual obstructions. The tour, which featured many of the collaborative artists from &quot;Plastic Beach&quot; and saw the touring band wearing naval attire, was later described by Albarn as having been extremely costly to produce, with the band barely breaking even on the shows, saying &quot;I loved doing it, but economically it was a fucking disaster.&quot; The tour was preceded by headline performances at several international music festivals, including the Coachella and Glastonbury festivals. On 21 November 2010, while still on tour, the band released the non-album single &quot;Doncamatic&quot; featuring British singer Daley.

During the North American leg of the Escape to Plastic Beach tour in the fall of 2010, Albarn continued recording Gorillaz songs entirely on his iPad. The recordings were later released as the album &quot;The Fall&quot;, first released digitally on Christmas Day 2010 and later given a physical release on 19 April 2011. &quot;The Fall&quot; is also co-produced by Stephen Sedgwick, the mixer engineer of the band. Albarn said the album served as a diary of the American leg of the tour, explaining that the tracks were presented exactly as they were on the day they were written and recorded with no additional production or overdubs: &quot;I literally made it on the road. I didn&#x27;t write it before, I didn&#x27;t prepare it. I just did it day by day as a kind of diary of my experience in America. If I left it until the New Year to release it then the cynics out there would say, &#x27;Oh well, it&#x27;s been tampered with&#x27;, but if I put it out now they&#x27;d know that I haven&#x27;t done anything because I&#x27;ve been on tour ever since.&quot; The band later released a &quot;Gorillaz edition&quot; of the Korg iElectribe music production app for iPad, featuring many of the same samples and sounds used by Albarn to create &quot;The Fall&quot;.

On 23 February 2012, Gorillaz released &quot;DoYaThing&quot;, a single to promote a Gorillaz-branded collection of Converse shoes which were released shortly after. The song was a part of Converse&#x27;s &quot;Three Artists, One Song&quot; project, with the two additional collaborators being James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem and André 3000 of Outkast. Two different edits of the song were released: a four-and-a-half minute radio edit released on Converse&#x27;s website and the full 13-minute version of the song released on the Gorillaz website. Hewlett returned to direct the single&#x27;s music video, featuring fictionalized animated versions of Murphy and André interacting with the Gorillaz&#x27; virtual members. The song received positive reviews from critics, with particular praise given to André 3000&#x27;s contributions to the track.

In April 2012, Albarn told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that he and Hewlett had fallen out and that future Gorillaz projects were &quot;unlikely&quot;. Tension between the two had been building, partly due to a belief held by Hewlett that his contributions to Gorillaz were being minimised. Speaking to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in April 2017, Hewlett explained: &quot;Damon had half the Clash on stage, and Bobby Womack and Mos Def and De La Soul, and fucking Hypnotic Brass Ensemble and Bashy and everyone else. It was the greatest band ever. And the screen on stage behind them seemed to get smaller every day. I&#x27;d say, &#x27;Have we got a new screen?&#x27; and the tour manager was like, &#x27;No, it&#x27;s the same screen.&#x27; Because it seemed to me like it was getting smaller.&quot; Albarn gave his side of the story in a separate interview, saying &quot;I think we were at a cross purposes somewhat on that last record [&quot;Plastic Beach&quot;], which is a shame. It was one of those things, the music and the videos weren&#x27;t working as well together, but I felt we&#x27;d made a really good record and I was into it.&quot; On 25 April 2012, in an interview with Metro, Albarn was more optimistic about Gorillaz&#x27; future, saying that once he had worked out his differences with Hewlett, he was sure that they would make another record. In June 2013, Hewlett confirmed that he and Albarn planned to someday continue Gorillaz and record a follow-up album to &quot;Plastic Beach&quot;, saying &quot;We&#x27;ll come back to it when the time is right.&quot;

===Hiatus and return with &quot;Humanz&quot; (2012–2018)===
Following the release of &quot;DoYaThing&quot; and the publicization of Albarn and Hewlett&#x27;s fall-out in 2012, Gorillaz entered a multiyear hiatus. During the hiatus, Albarn released a solo album, &quot;Everyday Robots&quot;, scored stage productions and continued to record and tour with Blur, while Hewlett held art exhibitions and attempted to create a film project which was ultimately never realized. While on tour in support of &quot;Everyday Robots&quot; in 2014, Albarn signaled openness to returning to Gorillaz, telling &quot;The National Post&quot; that he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t mind having another stab at a Gorillaz record&quot;. Two months later he reported that he had &quot;been writing quite a lot of songs on the road for Gorillaz&quot;. and at the end of 2014 confirmed in an interview with &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; that he was planning to record another Gorillaz album. Speaking about his relationship with Hewlett, Albarn said that the pair&#x27;s well-publicised fall-out had helped their relationship in the long term. Hewlett described the moment when he and Albarn agreed to continue Gorillaz at an afterparty after one of Albarn&#x27;s solo shows in 2014: &quot;We&#x27;d had a bit to drink, and he said, &#x27;Do you want to do another one?&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Do you?&#x27; and he said, &#x27;Do you?&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Yeah, sure.&#x27; I started work on it straight away, learning to draw the characters again. I played around by myself for eight months while he was performing with Blur in 2015.&quot;

Recording sessions for the band&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Humanz&quot;, began in late 2015 and continued through 2016, taking place in London, New York City, Paris and Jamaica. Albarn enlisted American hip-hop and house producer Anthony Khan, known by his stage name the Twilite Tone, to co-produce the album. Albarn chose Khan from a list of possible producers compiled by Parlophone, the band&#x27;s record label after Albarn and Khan spoke via Skype. &quot;Humanz&quot; was also co-produced by Remi Kabaka Jr., a friend of Albarn&#x27;s who had worked with him in the non-profit musical organization Africa Express and also has been the voice actor for the Gorillaz virtual band member Russel Hobbs since 2000. In conceptualizing the album, Albarn and Khan envisioned &quot;Humanz&quot; as being the soundtrack for &quot;a party for the end of the world&quot;, with Albarn specifically imagining a future in which Donald Trump won the 2016 U.S. presidential election as context for the album&#x27;s narrative (Trump becoming president was still considered an unlikely event at the time of recording), explaining &quot;Let&#x27;s use that as a kind of dark fantasy for this record, let&#x27;s imagine the night Donald Trump wins the election and how we&#x27;re all going to feel that night.&quot; Khan stated that &quot;The idea of Donald Trump being president allowed us to create a narrative together. I suggested that the album should be about joy, pain and urgency. That was to be our state of mind before we even touched a keyboard or an MPC. Especially in American music, dare I say black music, there&#x27;s a way of communicating joy that at the same time allows you to feel the struggle the person has been through. And the urgency is there because something needs to be done. So that was the mantra. I wanted to blend Damon, a Briton, with the joy and pain and struggle that African-American music can express.&quot; &quot;Humanz&quot; again featured a large cast of featured artists, including Popcaan, Vince Staples, DRAM, Jehnny Beth, Pusha T, Peven Everett, Danny Brown, Grace Jones and Mavis Staples, among others. The first track from the album released publicly was &quot;Hallelujah Money&quot; featuring Benjamin Clementine, released on 20 January 2017 with an accompanying video featuring Clementine. While not an official single, Albarn explained that the band chose to release the track on the day of Trump&#x27;s inauguration because &quot;It was meant to be something sung at the imaginary inauguration of Donald Trump, which turned out to be the real inauguration of Donald Trump, so we released it because we had imagined that happening and it did happen.&quot;

&quot;Humanz&quot; was released on 28 April 2017, the band&#x27;s first new studio album in 7 years. Featuring a &quot;modern-sounding urban hip-hop/R&amp;B sensibility&quot;, the album debuted at #2 on both the UK Album charts and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Humanz&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, although received some criticism from fans and critics for what was perceived as a diminished presence from Albarn in contrast to the abundance of featured artists. The album was released in both standard and deluxe editions, with the deluxe edition featuring an additional 6 bonus tracks and was promoted by the lead single &quot;Saturnz Barz&quot; featuring Popcaan and the later single &quot;Strobelite&quot; featuring Peven Everett. The Hewlett-directed music video for &quot;Saturnz Barz&quot; made use of YouTube&#x27;s 360-degree video format and reportedly cost $800,000 to create.

The band embarked on the Humanz Tour to support the album from the summer of 2017 to early 2018. Like the band&#x27;s previous tour, the Humanz Tour featured the touring band in full view of the audience with a large screen behind them displaying Hewlett-created visuals and featured several of the different collaborative artists from the band&#x27;s history. The tour was preceded by a handful of European warm-up shows, including the first Demon Dayz Festival held on 10 June 2017 at the Dreamland Margate theme park, a Gorillaz curated music festival which was later repeated in Los Angeles in October 2018. On 8 June 2017 the band released the non-album single &quot;Sleeping Powder&quot; with an accompanying music video and on 3 November 2017 a &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; version of &quot;Humanz&quot;, featuring an additional 14 unreleased tracks from the album&#x27;s sessions, including alternative versions of previously released songs as well as the single &quot;Garage Palace&quot; featuring Little Simz.

===&quot;The Now Now&quot; (2018–2019)===
Albarn continued recording while on the road during the Humanz Tour, and mentioned in an interview with &quot;Q Magazine&quot; in September 2017 that he was planning on releasing the material as a future Gorillaz album. Comparing the production of the album to &quot;The Fall&quot;, which was also recorded while the band was on tour, Albarn mentioned that &quot;It will be a more complete record than &quot;The Fall&quot;, but hopefully have that spontaneity.&quot; Albarn signaled his desire to complete and release the album quickly, adding that &quot;I really like the idea of making new music and playing it live almost simultaneously&quot; and &quot;If we&#x27;re going to do more Gorillaz we don&#x27;t want to wait seven years because, y&#x27;know, we&#x27;re getting on a bit now. During a September 2017 concert in Seattle, the band debuted a new song &quot;Ode to Idaho&quot;, which was later included on the album as &quot;Idaho&quot;. During the performance, Albarn stated it had been written in the days prior.

During a break in the Humanz Tour in February 2018, Albarn returned to London where he worked with producer James Ford, known for his work with Arctic Monkeys and Florence and the Machine, and Kabaka Jr. to finish the newly written material, resulting in the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;The Now Now&quot;, released on 29 June 2018. Featuring &quot;simple, mostly upbeat songs&quot; and 1980s new wave influences, the album was noted for its distinctly small list of featured artists compared to previous Gorillaz work, with only two tracks featuring any outside artists (the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Humility&quot; featuring George Benson and &quot;Hollywood&quot; featuring Snoop Dogg and Jamie Principle). Albarn mentioned that the few numbers of featured artists was partially due to the album&#x27;s quick production, which in turn was a result of Albarn wanting to finish the album before the band&#x27;s touring schedule resumed: &quot;We&#x27;ve been very lucky to be offered all the festivals this year on the back of the last record [&quot;Humanz&quot;]... but I didn&#x27;t want to do that unless I had something new to work with, so the only option was to make another record really quickly and not have lots of guests on it, because that takes a long time to organize; just do it all myself, really.&quot; Albarn also explained that with &quot;The Now Now&quot; he sought to make a Gorillaz album &quot;where I&#x27;m just singing for once&quot; and that the album is &quot;pretty much just me singing, very sort of in the world of 2-D.&quot;

 In the fictional Gorillaz storyline, the band introduced Ace from Cartoon Network&#x27;s animated series &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; as a temporary bassist of the band during &quot;The Now Now&quot; album cycle, filling in for the imprisoned Murdoc Niccals. Explaining the crossover in an interview with the BBC, Albarn said &quot;We were massive fans of &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; when they came out, the energy of that cartoon was really cool, and we kind of know the creator of it (Craig McCracken). It was a very organic thing.&quot;

The band&#x27;s remaining 2018 live dates were billed as The Now Now Tour to support the album, and included a performance in Tokyo on 22 June 2018 billed as &quot;The Now Now World Premiere&quot; in which the band played the full album live for the first and only time, a performance which was later broadcast by Boiler Room. On 16 December 2019, the documentary &quot;Gorillaz: Reject False Icons&quot; was screened worldwide on a one-day theatrical release. Filmed and directed by Hewlett&#x27;s son Denholm, the documentary showcases a behind-the-scenes look at the production of &quot;Humanz&quot; and &quot;The Now Now&quot; as well as the album&#x27;s associated tours. One week after the film&#x27;s theatrical release, a &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; version of the film featuring additional footage was released on the official Gorillaz YouTube channel in three parts. In the credits for &quot;Reject False Icons&quot;, Kabaka Jr. was listed as an official member of the band (labeled as &quot;A&amp;R/Producer&quot;) alongside Albarn and Hewlett for the first time.

===&quot;Song Machine&quot; project and &quot;Meanwhile EP&quot; (2020–2021)===

On 29 January 2020, the band announced its new project &quot;Song Machine&quot;. Eschewing the typical album format of releasing music, Song Machine is instead a web series that sees the band releasing one new song a month as &quot;episodes&quot; to the series, with 11 episodes releasing to comprise the first &quot;season&quot;. Elaborating on the idea behind &quot;Song Machine&quot; in a radio interview shortly after the announcement of the project, Albarn explained that &quot;We no longer kind of see ourselves as constrained to making albums. We can now make episodes and seasons.&quot; Each episode features previously unannounced guest musicians on new Gorillaz material, with the first being &quot;Momentary Bliss&quot;, which was released on 31 January and features both British rapper Slowthai and the Kent-based punk rock duo Slaves. Upon the premiere of &quot;Momentary Bliss&quot;, Albarn revealed that the group had been in the studio with Schoolboy Q and Sampa the Great among others, although he did say that these songs were likely to be saved for future episodes of &quot;Song Machine&quot;. The group also teased a possible collaboration with Australian band Tame Impala on Instagram.

On 27 February, the band released the second episode of &quot;Song Machine&quot; entitled &quot;Désolé&quot;. The song features Malian singer Fatoumata Diawara. The third episode, &quot;Aries&quot;, released on 9 April and featured Peter Hook and Georgia. The fourth track &quot;How Far?&quot; featuring Tony Allen and Skepta was released 2 May. This song was released without an accompanying music video as a tribute to Allen, who died on 30 April. On 26 May, Gorillaz announced the release of a new book titled &quot;Gorillaz Almanac&quot;. The book comes in three editions: standard, deluxe and super deluxe, all of which were set to release on 23 October but has since been delayed to 22 December with a physical release of season one of &quot;Song Machine&quot; included with each copy. On 9 June, the band released &quot;Friday 13th&quot;, the fourth episode of &quot;Song Machine&quot;. The track features French-British rapper Octavian. On 20 July, the band released &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, the fifth episode of &quot;Song Machine&quot;, in honour of Pac-Man&#x27;s 40th anniversary. The track features American rapper Schoolboy Q.

On 9 September, the band released &quot;Strange Timez&quot;, the sixth episode of &quot;Song Machine&quot;. The track features Robert Smith, from the Cure. Gorillaz also announced the title and tracklist for &quot;Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez&quot;, released on 23 October 2020, featuring further guest appearances from Elton John, 6lack, JPEGMafia, Kano, Roxani Arias, Moonchild Sanelly and Chai, among others. On 1 October, the band released &quot;The Pink Phantom&quot;, the seventh episode of &quot;Song Machine&quot;. The track features Elton John and American R&amp;B recording artist 6lack. Before the release of &quot;Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez&quot;, Gorillaz started a radio show on Apple Music called &quot;Song Machine Radio&quot; where each virtual character has a turn to invite special guests and play some of their favourite tunes. A few days ahead of the release of &quot;Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez&quot;, Albarn revealed that he had written a song for the project&#x27;s second season.

On 5 November, the band released &quot;The Valley of the Pagans&quot;, the eighth episode of &quot;Song Machine&quot;. The track features American singer Beck. The music video is somewhat notorious for being the first major studio production filmed in &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;. The video ends with a reference to previous album, &quot;Plastic Beach&quot;. For unknown reasons, the music video on the official Gorillaz YouTube channel was set to private just a few days after its initial premiere. On 9 March 2021, Gorillaz uploaded an alternative version of the music video to their official YouTube channel, which does not feature any gameplay from &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;. On 24 December, the band released &quot;The Lost Chord&quot;, the ninth and final episode of the first season of &quot;Song Machine&quot;. The track features British musician Leee John.

On 26 March 2021, the band celebrated its debut album&#x27;s 20th anniversary with oncoming reissues of their catalog and teases of non-fungible tokens; due to its impact on climate change, the latter was met with criticism by various sources and fans—some noting that the act contradicts the environmental themes of &quot;Plastic Beach&quot;. No non-fungible tokens have since released. The band also announced a boxset, the &quot;G Collection,&quot; containing six of their studio albums—excluding &quot;The Fall&quot;—for Record Store Day. On 10 August 2021, Gorillaz debuted three new songs, &quot;Meanwhile&quot; (featuring British rapper Jelani Blackman), &quot;Jimmy Jimmy&quot; (featuring British rapper AJ Tracey), and &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; (featuring Jamaican-British singer Alicaì Harley), during a free concert at The O2 Arena in London, England exclusively for National Health Service employees and their families. They then performed them again at the subsequent concert open to the public the next day (both of which served as the first live audience concerts of the Song Machine Tour). These three songs were announced to be tracks from a new EP entitled &quot;Meanwhile&quot;, with the cover originally published on TikTok.

=== World Tour and &quot;Cracker Island&quot; (2022–present) ===
On 17 September 2021, Albarn revealed that he had recorded a new Gorillaz song with Bad Bunny while in Jamaica, and, at the time, said it would be the first single for a new album, influenced by Latin America, releasing in 2022. The concept for the album would later change, with the song being announced at a later date. On 31 August 2022, the name of this song was revealed to be &quot;Tormenta&quot;.

In November 2021, Albarn announced that an animated film based on the band was in the works at Netflix, but by February 2023, it had been cancelled.

Throughout 2022, Gorillaz went on a world tour in South America, Europe, Australia, and North America, where they debuted new material. In June 2022, the band began teasing the release of new material, with promotional displays and websites surfacing encouraging fans to sign up to be a part of &quot;The Last Cult&quot;. The band released a new single (regularly performed on tour) called &quot;Cracker Island&quot;, featuring Thundercat and produced with Greg Kurstin, on 22 June, with the music video being released on 28 July. Their scheduled performance at the first Splendour in the Grass festival in Queensland, Australia on 22 July was cancelled owing to torrential rain. In July 2022, they played at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre as part of Illuminate Adelaide, supported by Moonchild Sanelly. In August 2022, the band performed the new song &quot;New Gold&quot; (featuring Tame Impala and Bootie Brown) at All Points East in London, and released it as their second single for their eighth studio album, announced on the same day to be titled &quot;Cracker Island&quot; (released on 24 February 2023). The album, produced with Kurstin, also features appearances from Stevie Nicks, Bad Bunny, Beck, and Adeleye Omotayo. On 4 November, the band released the third single from &quot;Cracker Island&quot;, &quot;Baby Queen&quot; (previously released on the &quot;FIFA 23&quot; soundtrack). On 8 December, the band released the album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Skinny Ape&quot;, alongside the announcement of two virtual shows in Times Square and Piccadilly Circus on 17 and 18 December, respectively. On 27 January 2023, the album&#x27;s fifth single, &quot;Silent Running&quot; featuring Adeleye Omotayo, was released, with a music video following on 8 February. The album received mostly positive reviews, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine describing it as &quot;less an exploration of new sonic territory so much as it is a reaffirmation of [Albarn&#x27;s] strengths&quot; with &quot;a clean, efficient energy&quot;.

On 27 February 2023, a deluxe version of &quot;Cracker Island&quot; was released with five bonus tracks. Previous collaborators Del the Funky Homosapien and De La Soul appeared on the deluxe version, as well as Brazilian artist MC Bin Laden. The album was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album for the 66th Annual Grammy Awards in 2024.

To celebrate their 25th anniversary, Gorillaz released a video on January 29, 2025 titled &quot;NOSTALGIAZ&quot; featuring clips from their music videos set to &quot;Orchestral Intro&quot; from &quot;Plastic Beach&quot;.

Murdoc Faust Niccals (born Murdoc Alphonce Niccals) is the bassist for the band. He is voiced by Phil Cornwell and was created by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. Murdoc is based on Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, Victor Frankenstein, and Creeper from &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;. In particular, he was inspired by a photograph of the Rolling Stones taken in 1968 by photographer David Bailey. Once described by creator Jamie Hewlett as being the &quot;unpleasant villain of the band&quot;. Murdoc is a Satanist who is often depicted wearing an inverted cross necklace, with &quot;Hail Satan&quot; being a common catchphrase of his. He was created by Hewlett and Damon Albarn in 1998, with his first official appearance being Gorillaz&#x27; debut EP &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot; in 2000.

Stuart Harold &quot;2-D&quot; Pot provides the lead vocals and plays the keyboard for the band. 2-D&#x27;s singing voice is provided by Blur frontman Damon Albarn on Gorillaz&#x27; recordings and performances; his speaking voice was provided by actor Nelson De Freitas in various Gorillaz direct-to-video projects such as &quot;Phase One: Celebrity Take Down&quot; and &quot;Phase Two: Slowboat to Hades&quot;. In 2017, Kevin Bishop was cast as the new speaking voice of 2-D. He was created by Albarn and Jamie Hewlett in 1998. Most of 2-D&#x27;s recordings were made with a megaphone part due to his very bass voice, confirmed Hewlett.
Noodle provides the lead guitar and keyboards, as well as some occasional vocals for the band. Like all other band members of Gorillaz, she was created in 1998 by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. Originally from Japan, Noodle has been voiced by Haruka Kuroda, Miho Hatori of Cibo Matto, and Haruka Abe. Noodle was originally conceptualised by co-creator Jamie Hewlett as a 17-year-old girl named Paula Cracker, but co-creator Damon Albarn noted that the character was too similar to the characters that Hewlett is typically known for drawing, and recommended that he attempt to create &quot;something different&quot;. Taking Albarn&#x27;s advice, Hewlett designed an illustration of a 10-year-old Japanese girl named Noodle who is a martial arts expert. In October 2016, Noodle became the global ambassador for Jaguar Racing, appearing in a short commercial advertising the company.

Russel Hobbs was originally conceptualized by Jamie Hewlett and Damon Albarn in 1998 as a metafictional representation of the hip hop aspects of Gorillaz, embodying the spirit of the bands&#x27; collaborations with various rappers over the years. He is referenced in the lyrics to the &quot;Gorillaz&quot; track &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;. He was originally inspired by Hewlett&#x27;s love for hip hop artists like Ice Cube (the cousin of rapper Del the Funky Homosapien, who raps on &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; and &quot;Rock The House&quot; as Del the Ghost Rapper). Russel&#x27;s speaking voice is provided by percussionist and DJ Remi Kabaka Jr., who has been an actual percussionist and producer for Gorillaz since &quot;Humanz&quot; in 2017. Russel&#x27;s fictional backstory of being possessed by the spirits of dead musicians is what originally inspired the usage of collaborators and guests on Gorillaz&#x27; albums.

Additional members includes Ace, a &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot; character from the Gangreen Gang, a green-skinned gang making part of this universe, and the bassist recording with the band on &quot;The Now Now&quot; (2018) and Murdoc&#x27;s substitute, while the latter was arrested in prison until he returns with the band 1 year later. Cyborg Noodle, Noodle&#x27;s substitute on guitar and a robotic version of herself, while the latter was lost somewhere in Japan. Cyborg Noodle&#x27;s appearance is only used for the Plastic Beach phase. Del tha Ghost Rapper, a fictionalized version of real-life rapper Del tha Funkee Homosapien, Russel&#x27;s spirit, and the band&#x27;s current rapper from 1998 to 2001, until he was back in 2023 during the sessions of &quot;Cracker Island&quot;, and Paula Cracker, the band&#x27;s earlier guitarist and 2-D&#x27;s former girlfriend, when the band was named Gorilla, until Noodle&#x27;s arrival on guitar.

<text>GW-BASIC is a dialect of the BASIC programming language developed by Microsoft from IBM BASICA. Functionally identical to BASICA, its BASIC interpreter is a fully self-contained executable and does not need the Cassette BASIC ROM found in the original. It was bundled with MS-DOS operating systems on IBM PC–compatibles by Microsoft.

The language is suitable for simple games, business programs and the like. Since it was included with most versions of MS-DOS, it was also a low-cost way for many aspiring programmers to learn the fundamentals of computer programming. Microsoft also sold a BASIC compiler, BASCOM, compatible with GW-BASIC, for programs needing more speed.

According to Mark Jones Lorenzo, given the scope of the language, &quot;GW-BASIC is arguably the &quot;ne plus ultra&quot; of Microsoft&#x27;s family of line-numbered BASICs stretching back to Altair BASIC — and perhaps even of line-numbered BASIC in general.&quot;

With the release of MS-DOS 5.0, GW-BASIC&#x27;s place was taken by QBasic, a slightly abridged version of the interpreter part of the separately available QuickBASIC interpreter and compiler package.

On May 21, 2020, Microsoft released the 8088 assembler source code for GW-BASIC 1.0 on GitHub under the MIT License.

== Features ==
IBM BASICA and GW-BASIC are largely ports of MBASIC version 5.x, but with added features specifically for the IBM PC hardware. Common features of BASIC-80 5.x and BASICA/GW-BASIC include:
* codice_1 loops
* Variable names of up to 40 characters
* codice_2 statement to set the starting index of array variables as either 0 or 1
* Dynamic string space allocation
* codice_3, which allowed field-separator characters like comma to be ignored
* codice_4 statement for executing machine-language routines
* codice_5 and codice_6 commands
* Ability to save programs in either tokenized binary format or ASCII text

The ability to &quot;crunch&quot; program lines by omitting spaces, a common feature of earlier Microsoft BASIC implementations, was removed from BASIC-80 5.x and BASICA/GWBASIC.

BASIC-80 programs not using codice_7/codice_8 statements run under GW-BASIC. BASICA adds many features for the IBM PC such as sound, graphics, and memory commands. Features not present in BASIC-80 include the ability to execute the codice_9 function with no parameters and the ability to also save programs in a &quot;protected&quot; format, preventing them from being codice_10ed. BASICA also allows double-precision numbers to be used with mathematical and trigonometric functions such as codice_11, codice_12, and codice_13, which wasn&#x27;t allowed in 8-bit versions of BASIC. This feature was normally not enabled and required the optional parameter codice_14 at startup, i.e., codice_15. BASIC&#x27;s memory footprint was slightly increased if it was used.

Microsoft did not offer a generic version of MS-DOS until v3.20 in 1986; before then, all variants of the operating system were OEM versions. Depending on the OEM, BASIC was distributed as either BASICA.EXE or GWBASIC.EXE. The former should not be confused with IBM BASICA, which always came as a COM file. Some variants of BASIC has extra features to support a particular machine. For example, the AT&amp;T and Tandy versions of DOS include a special GW-BASIC that supports their enhanced sound and graphics capabilities.

The initial version of GW-BASIC is the one included with Compaq DOS 1.13, released with the Compaq Portable in 1983, and was analogous to IBM BASICA 1.10. It uses the CP/M-derived file control blocks for disk access and does not support subdirectories. Later versions support subdirectories, improved graphics, and other capabilities.

GW-BASIC 3.20 (1986) adds EGA graphics support (no version of BASICA or GW-BASIC had VGA support) and is the last major new version released before it was superseded by QBasic.

Buyers of Hercules Graphics Cards received a special version of GW-BASIC on the card&#x27;s utility disk that is called HBASIC, which adds support for its 720×348 monochrome graphics. Other versions of BASICA/GW-BASIC do not support Hercules graphics and can only display graphics on that card through the use of third-party CGA emulation, such as SIMCGA.

GW-BASIC has a command-line-based integrated development environment (IDE) based on Dartmouth BASIC. Using the cursor movement keys, any line displayed on the screen can be edited. It also includes function key shortcuts at the bottom of the screen. Like other early microcomputer versions of BASIC, GW-BASIC lacks many of the structures needed for structured programming, such as local variables. GW-BASIC programs executed relatively slowly because it was an interpreted language. All program lines must be numbered; all non-numbered lines are considered to be commands in direct mode to be executed immediately. Program source files are normally saved in binary compressed format with tokens replacing keywords, with an option to save in ASCII text form.

The GW-BASIC command-line environment has commands to codice_16, codice_17, codice_18, codice_10 the current program, or quit to the operating codice_20; these commands can also be used as program statements. There is little support for structured programming in GW-BASIC. All codice_21/codice_22/codice_23 conditional statements must be written on one line, although codice_24/codice_25 statements may group multiple lines. Functions can only be defined using the single line codice_26 statement (e.g., codice_27). The data type of variables can be specified with a character at the end of the variable name: codice_28 is a string of characters, codice_29 is an integer, etc. Groups of variables can also be set to default types based on the initial letter of their name by use of the codice_30, codice_31, etc., statements. The default type for undeclared variables not identified by such typing statements is single-precision floating-point (32-bit MBF).

GW-BASIC allows use of joystick and light pen input devices. GW-BASIC can read from and write to files and COM ports; it can also do event trapping for ports. Since the cassette tape port interface of the original IBM PC was never implemented on compatibles, cassette operations are not supported. GW-BASIC can play simple music using the codice_32 statement, needing a string of notes represented in a music macro language, e.g., codice_33. More low-level control is possible with the codice_34 statement, which takes the arguments of a frequency in hertz and a length in clock ticks for the standard internal PC speaker in IBM machines. Consequently, sound is limited to single channel beeps and whistles as befits a &quot;business&quot; machine. GW-BASIC for the Tandy 1000 allows up to three channels of sound for the codice_34 and codice_32 commands.

== Name ==
There are several theories on what the initials &quot;GW&quot; represent. Greg Whitten, an early Microsoft employee who developed the standards in the company&#x27;s BASIC compiler line, says that Bill Gates picked the name GW-BASIC. Whitten refers to it as &quot;Gee-Whiz&quot; BASIC and is unsure whether Gates named the program after him. The &quot;Microsoft User Manual&quot; from Microsoft Press also refers to it by the &quot;Gee-Whiz&quot; BASIC name. It may have also been nicknamed &quot;Gee-Whiz&quot; because of its numerous graphics commands. Other common theories as to the initials&#x27; origins include &quot;Graphics and Windows&quot;, &quot;Gates, William&quot; (Microsoft&#x27;s president at the time), or &quot;Gates–Whitten&quot; (the two main designers of the program).

<text>Granite ( ) is a coarse-grained (phaneritic) intrusive igneous rock composed mostly of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase. It forms from magma with a high content of silica and alkali metal oxides that slowly cools and solidifies underground. It is common in the continental crust of Earth, where it is found in igneous intrusions. These range in size from dikes only a few centimeters across to batholiths exposed over hundreds of square kilometers.

Granite is typical of a larger family of &quot;granitic rocks&quot;, or &quot;granitoids&quot;, that are composed mostly of coarse-grained quartz and feldspars in varying proportions. These rocks are classified by the relative percentages of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase (the QAPF classification), with true granite representing granitic rocks rich in quartz and alkali feldspar. Most granitic rocks also contain mica or amphibole minerals, though a few (known as leucogranites) contain almost no dark minerals.

Granite is nearly always massive (lacking any internal structures), hard (falling between 6 and 7 on the Mohs hardness scale), and tough. These properties have made granite a widespread construction stone throughout human history.

==Description==

The word &quot;granite&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;granum&quot;, a grain, in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a completely crystalline rock. Granites can be predominantly white, pink, or gray in color, depending on their mineralogy. Granitic rocks mainly consist of feldspar, quartz, mica, and amphibole minerals, which form an interlocking, somewhat equigranular matrix of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker biotite mica and amphibole (often hornblende) peppering the lighter color minerals. Occasionally some individual crystals (phenocrysts) are larger than the groundmass, in which case the texture is known as porphyritic. A granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite porphyry. Granitoid is a general, descriptive field term for lighter-colored, coarse-grained igneous rocks. Petrographic examination is required for identification of specific types of granitoids. The alkali feldspar in granites is typically orthoclase or microcline and is often perthitic. The plagioclase is typically sodium-rich oligoclase. Phenocrysts are usually alkali feldspar.

Granitic rocks are classified according to the QAPF diagram for coarse grained plutonic rocks and are named according to the percentage of quartz, alkali feldspar (orthoclase, sanidine, or microcline) and plagioclase feldspar on the A-Q-P half of the diagram. True granite (according to modern petrologic convention) contains between 20% and 60% quartz by volume, with 35% to 90% of the total feldspar consisting of alkali feldspar. Granitic rocks poorer in quartz are classified as syenites or monzonites, while granitic rocks dominated by plagioclase are classified as granodiorites or tonalites. Granitic rocks with over 90% alkali feldspar are classified as alkali feldspar granites. Granitic rock with more than 60% quartz, which is uncommon, is classified simply as quartz-rich granitoid or, if composed almost entirely of quartz, as quartzolite.

True granites are further classified by the percentage of their total feldspar that is alkali feldspar. Granites whose feldspar is 65% to 90% alkali feldspar are syenogranites, while the feldspar in monzogranite is 35% to 65% alkali feldspar. A granite containing both muscovite and biotite micas is called a binary or &quot;two-mica&quot; granite. Two-mica granites are typically high in potassium and low in plagioclase, and are usually S-type granites or A-type granites, as described below.

Another aspect of granite classification is the ratios of metals that potentially form feldspars. Most granites have a composition such that almost all their aluminum and alkali metals (sodium and potassium) are combined as feldspar. This is the case when K2O + Na2O + CaO &gt; Al2O3 &gt; K2O + Na2O. Such granites are described as &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;metaluminous&quot;. Granites in which there is not enough aluminum to combine with all the alkali oxides as feldspar (Al2O3 &lt; K2O + Na2O) are described as &quot;peralkaline&quot;, and they contain unusual sodium amphiboles such as riebeckite. Granites in which there is an excess of aluminum beyond what can be taken up in feldspars (Al2O3 &gt; CaO + K2O + Na2O) are described as &quot;peraluminous&quot;, and they contain aluminum-rich minerals such as muscovite.

===Physical properties===
The average density of granite is between , its compressive strength usually lies above 200 MPa (29,000 psi), and its viscosity near STP is 3–6·1020 Pa·s.

The melting temperature of dry granite at ambient pressure is ; it is strongly reduced in the presence of water, down to 650 °C at a few hundred megapascals of pressure.

Granite has poor primary permeability overall, but strong secondary permeability through cracks and fractures if they are present.

===Chemical composition===

A worldwide average of the chemical composition of granite, by mass percent, based on 2485 analyses:
The medium-grained equivalent of granite is microgranite. The extrusive igneous rock equivalent of granite is rhyolite.

==Occurrence==
Granitic rock is widely distributed throughout the continental crust. Much of it was intruded during the Precambrian age; it is the most abundant basement rock that underlies the relatively thin sedimentary veneer of the continents. Outcrops of granite tend to form tors, domes or bornhardts, and rounded massifs. Granites sometimes occur in circular depressions surrounded by a range of hills, formed by the metamorphic aureole or hornfels. Granite often occurs as relatively small, less than 100 km2 stock masses (stocks) and in batholiths that are often associated with orogenic mountain ranges. Small dikes of granitic composition called aplites are often associated with the margins of granitic intrusions. In some locations, very coarse-grained pegmatite masses occur with granite.

==Origin==

Granite forms from silica-rich (felsic) magmas. Felsic magmas are thought to form by addition of heat or water vapor to rock of the lower crust, rather than by decompression of mantle rock, as is the case with basaltic magmas. It has also been suggested that some granites found at convergent boundaries between tectonic plates, where oceanic crust subducts below continental crust, were formed from sediments subducted with the oceanic plate. The melted sediments would have produced magma intermediate in its silica content, which became further enriched in silica as it rose through the overlying crust.

Early fractional crystallisation serves to reduce a melt in magnesium and chromium, and enrich the melt in iron, sodium, potassium, aluminum, and silicon. Further fractionation reduces the content of iron, calcium, and titanium. This is reflected in the high content of alkali feldspar and quartz in granite.

The presence of granitic rock in island arcs shows that fractional crystallization alone can convert a basaltic magma to a granitic magma, but the quantities produced are small. For example, granitic rock makes up just 4% of the exposures in the South Sandwich Islands. In continental arc settings, granitic rocks are the most common plutonic rocks, and batholiths composed of these rock types extend the entire length of the arc. There are no indication of magma chambers where basaltic magmas differentiate into granites, or of cumulates produced by mafic crystals settling out of the magma. Other processes must produce these great volumes of felsic magma. One such process is injection of basaltic magma into the lower crust, followed by differentiation, which leaves any cumulates in the mantle. Another is heating of the lower crust by underplating basaltic magma, which produces felsic magma directly from crustal rock. The two processes produce different kinds of granites, which may be reflected in the division between S-type (produced by underplating) and I-type (produced by injection and differentiation) granites, discussed below.

===Alphabet classification system===

The composition and origin of any magma that differentiates into granite leave certain petrological evidence as to what the granite&#x27;s parental rock was. The final texture and composition of a granite are generally distinctive as to its parental rock. For instance, a granite that is derived from partial melting of metasedimentary rocks may have more alkali feldspar, whereas a granite derived from partial melting of metaigneous rocks may be richer in plagioclase. It is on this basis that the modern &quot;alphabet&quot; classification schemes are based.

The letter-based Chappell &amp; White classification system was proposed initially to divide granites into I-type (igneous source) granite and S-type (sedimentary sources). Both types are produced by partial melting of crustal rocks, either metaigneous rocks or metasedimentary rocks.

I-type granites are characterized by a high content of sodium and calcium, and by a strontium isotope ratio, 87Sr/86Sr, of less than 0.708. 87Sr is produced by radioactive decay of 87Rb, and since rubidium is concentrated in the crust relative to the mantle, a low ratio suggests origin in the mantle. The elevated sodium and calcium favor crystallization of hornblende rather than biotite. I-type granites are known for their porphyry copper deposits. I-type granites are orogenic (associated with mountain building) and usually metaluminous.

S-type granites are sodium-poor and aluminum-rich. As a result, they contain micas such as biotite and muscovite instead of hornblende. Their strontium isotope ratio is typically greater than 0.708, suggesting a crustal origin. They also commonly contain xenoliths of metamorphosed sedimentary rock, and host tin ores. Their magmas are water-rich, and they readily solidify as the water outgasses from the magma at lower pressure, so they less commonly make it to the surface than magmas of I-type granites, which are thus more common as volcanic rock (rhyolite). They are also orogenic but range from metaluminous to strongly peraluminous.

Although both I- and S-type granites are orogenic, I-type granites are more common close to the convergent boundary than S-type. This is attributed to thicker crust further from the boundary, which results in more crustal melting.

A-type granites show a peculiar mineralogy and geochemistry, with particularly high silicon and potassium at the expense of calcium and magnesium and a high content of high field strength cations (cations with a small radius and high electrical charge, such as zirconium, niobium, tantalum, and rare earth elements.) They are not orogenic, forming instead over hot spots and continental rifting, and are metaluminous to mildly peralkaline and iron-rich. These granites are produced by partial melting of refractory lithology such as granulites in the lower continental crust at high thermal gradients. This leads to significant extraction of hydrous felsic melts from granulite-facies resitites. A-type granites occur in the Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province in the Royal Society Range, Antarctica. The rhyolites of the Yellowstone Caldera are examples of volcanic equivalents of A-type granite.

M-type granite was later proposed to cover those granites that were clearly sourced from crystallized mafic magmas, generally sourced from the mantle. Although the fractional crystallisation of basaltic melts can yield small amounts of granites, which are sometimes found in island arcs, such granites must occur together with large amounts of basaltic rocks.

H-type granites were suggested for hybrid granites, which were hypothesized to form by mixing between mafic and felsic from different sources, such as M-type and S-type. However, the big difference in rheology between mafic and felsic magmas makes this process problematic in nature.

===Granitization===

Granitization is an old, and largely discounted, hypothesis that granite is formed in place through extreme metasomatism. The idea behind granitization was that fluids would supposedly bring in elements such as potassium, and remove others, such as calcium, to transform a metamorphic rock into granite. This was supposed to occur across a migrating front. However, experimental work had established by the 1960s that granites were of igneous origin. The mineralogical and chemical features of granite can be explained only by crystal-liquid phase relations, showing that there must have been at least enough melting to mobilize the magma.

However, at sufficiently deep crustal levels, the distinction between metamorphism and crustal melting itself becomes vague. Conditions for crystallization of liquid magma are close enough to those of high-grade metamorphism that the rocks often bear a close resemblance. Under these conditions, granitic melts can be produced in place through the partial melting of metamorphic rocks by extracting melt-mobile elements such as potassium and silicon into the melts but leaving others such as calcium and iron in granulite residues. This may be the origin of &quot;migmatites&quot;. A migmatite consists of dark, refractory rock (the &quot;melanosome&quot;) that is permeated by sheets and channels of light granitic rock (the &quot;leucosome&quot;). The leucosome is interpreted as partial melt of a parent rock that has begun to separate from the remaining solid residue (the melanosome). If enough partial melt is produced, it will separate from the source rock, become more highly evolved through fractional crystallization during its ascent toward the surface, and become the magmatic parent of granitic rock. The residue of the source rock becomes a granulite.

The partial melting of solid rocks requires high temperatures and the addition of water or other volatiles which lower the solidus temperature (temperature at which partial melting commences) of these rocks. It was long debated whether crustal thickening in orogens (mountain belts along convergent boundaries) was sufficient to produce granite melts by radiogenic heating, but recent work suggests that this is not a viable mechanism. In-situ granitization requires heating by the asthenospheric mantle or by underplating with mantle-derived magmas.

==Ascent and emplacement==
Granite magmas have a density of 2.4 Mg/m3, much less than the 2.8 Mg/m3 of high-grade metamorphic rock. This gives them tremendous buoyancy, so that ascent of the magma is inevitable once enough magma has accumulated. However, the question of precisely how such large quantities of magma are able to shove aside country rock to make room for themselves (the &quot;room problem&quot;) is still a matter of research.

Two main mechanisms are thought to be important:
* Stokes diapir
* Fracture propagation

Of these two mechanisms, Stokes diapirism has been favoured for many years in the absence of a reasonable alternative. The basic idea is that magma will rise through the crust as a single mass through buoyancy. As it rises, it heats the wall rocks, causing them to behave as a power-law fluid and thus flow around the intrusion allowing it to pass without major heat loss. This is entirely feasible in the warm, ductile lower crust where rocks are easily deformed, but runs into problems in the upper crust which is far colder and more brittle. Rocks there do not deform so easily: for magma to rise as a diapir it would expend far too much energy in heating wall rocks, thus cooling and solidifying before reaching higher levels within the crust.

Fracture propagation is the mechanism preferred by many geologists as it largely eliminates the major problems of moving a huge mass of magma through cold brittle crust. Magma rises instead in small channels along self-propagating dykes which form along new or pre-existing fracture or fault systems and networks of active shear zones. As these narrow conduits open, the first magma to enter solidifies and provides a form of insulation for later magma.

These mechanisms can operate in tandem. For example, diapirs may continue to rise through the brittle upper crust through stoping, where the granite cracks the roof rocks, removing blocks of the overlying crust which then sink to the bottom of the diapir while the magma rises to take their place. This can occur as piecemeal stopping (stoping of small blocks of chamber roof), as cauldron subsidence (collapse of large blocks of chamber roof), or as roof foundering (complete collapse of the roof of a shallow magma chamber accompanied by a caldera eruption.) There is evidence for cauldron subsidence at the Mt. Ascutney intrusion in eastern Vermont. Evidence for piecemeal stoping is found in intrusions that are rimmed with &quot;igneous breccia&quot; containing fragments of country rock.

Assimilation is another mechanism of ascent, where the granite melts its way up into the crust and removes overlying material in this way. This is limited by the amount of thermal energy available, which must be replenished by crystallization of higher-melting minerals in the magma. Thus, the magma is melting crustal rock at its roof while simultaneously crystallizing at its base. This results in steady contamination with crustal material as the magma rises. This may not be evident in the major and minor element chemistry, since the minerals most likely to crystallize at the base of the chamber are the same ones that would crystallize anyway, but crustal assimilation is detectable in isotope ratios. Heat loss to the country rock means that ascent by assimilation is limited to distance similar to the height of the magma chamber.

==Weathering==
Physical weathering occurs on a large scale in the form of exfoliation joints, which are the result of granite&#x27;s expanding and fracturing as pressure is relieved when overlying material is removed by erosion or other processes.

Chemical weathering of granite occurs when dilute carbonic acid, and other acids present in rain and soil waters, alter feldspar in a process called hydrolysis. As demonstrated in the following reaction, this causes potassium feldspar to form kaolinite, with potassium ions, bicarbonate, and silica in solution as byproducts. An end product of granite weathering is grus, which is often made up of coarse-grained fragments of disintegrated granite.

Climatic variations also influence the weathering rate of granites. For about two thousand years, the relief engravings on Cleopatra&#x27;s Needle obelisk had survived the arid conditions of its origin before its transfer to London. Within two hundred years, the red granite has drastically deteriorated in the damp and polluted air there.

Soil development on granite reflects the rock&#x27;s high quartz content and dearth of available bases, with the base-poor status predisposing the soil to acidification and podzolization in cool humid climates as the weather-resistant quartz yields much sand. Feldspars also weather slowly in cool climes, allowing sand to dominate the fine-earth fraction. In warm humid regions, the weathering of feldspar as described above is accelerated so as to allow a much higher proportion of clay with the Cecil soil series a prime example of the consequent Ultisol great soil group.

Fires can also contribute to the weathering of granite. The high temperatures reached during a fire—often exceeding 1000 °C—can cause significant physical and chemical processes that alter the rock. Among the physical processes, the differential thermal expansion of individual mineral grains, the anisotropic expansion of certain minerals, and polymorphic transformations, such as the alpha-beta quartz transition, induce substantial volume changes and generate internal stresses that damage the granite. Additionally, the decomposition of certain granite constituents, such as phyllosilicates, at specific temperatures further contributes to granite degradation. As a result, granite becomes micro-fractured, its total porosity increases, and its mechanical strength is significantly reduced.

==Natural radiation==

Granite is a natural source of radiation, like most natural stones. Potassium-40 is a radioactive isotope of weak emission, and a constituent of alkali feldspar, which in turn is a common component of granitic rocks, more abundant in alkali feldspar granite and syenites. Some granites contain around 10 to 20 parts per million (ppm) of uranium. By contrast, more mafic rocks, such as tonalite, gabbro and diorite, have 1 to 5 ppm uranium, and limestones and sedimentary rocks usually have equally low amounts.

Many large granite plutons are sources for palaeochannel-hosted or roll front uranium ore deposits, where the uranium washes into the sediments from the granite uplands and associated, often highly radioactive pegmatites.

Cellars and basements built into soils over granite can become a trap for radon gas, which is formed by the decay of uranium. Radon gas poses significant health concerns and is the number two cause of lung cancer in the US behind smoking.

Thorium occurs in all granites. Conway granite has been noted for its relatively high thorium concentration of 56±6 ppm.

There is some concern that some granite sold as countertops or building material may be hazardous to health. Dan Steck of St. Johns University has stated
that approximately 5% of all granite is of concern, with the caveat that only a tiny percentage of the tens of thousands of granite slab types have been tested. Resources from national geological survey organizations are accessible online to assist in assessing the risk factors in granite country and design rules relating, in particular, to preventing accumulation of radon gas in enclosed basements and dwellings.

A study of granite countertops was done (initiated and paid for by the Marble Institute of America) in November 2008 by National Health and Engineering Inc. of USA. In this test, all of the 39 full-size granite slabs that were measured for the study showed radiation levels well below the European Union safety standards (section 4.1.1.1 of the National Health and Engineering study) and radon emission levels well below the average outdoor radon concentrations in the US.

==Industry and uses==
Granite and related marble industries are considered one of the oldest industries in the world, existing as far back as Ancient Egypt. Major modern exporters of granite include China, India, Italy, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Sweden, Spain and the United States.

===Antiquity===

The Red Pyramid of Egypt (), named for the light crimson hue of its exposed limestone surfaces, is the third largest of Egyptian pyramids. Pyramid of Menkaure, likely dating 2510 BC, was constructed of limestone and granite blocks. The Great Pyramid of Giza (c. 2580 BC) contains a granite sarcophagus fashioned of &quot;Red Aswan Granite&quot;. The mostly ruined Black Pyramid dating from the reign of Amenemhat III once had a polished granite pyramidion or capstone, which is now on display in the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (see Dahshur). Other uses in Ancient Egypt include columns, door lintels, sills, jambs, and wall and floor veneer. How the Egyptians worked the solid granite is still a matter of debate. Tool marks described by the Egyptologist Anna Serotta indicate the use of flint tools on finer work with harder stones, e.g. when producing the hieroglyphic inscriptions. Patrick Hunt has postulated that the Egyptians used emery, which has greater hardness.

The Seokguram Grotto in Korea is a Buddhist shrine and part of the Bulguksa temple complex. Completed in 774 AD, it is an artificial grotto constructed entirely of granite. The main Buddha of the grotto is a highly regarded piece of Buddhist art, and along with the temple complex to which it belongs, Seokguram was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1995.

Rajaraja Chola I of the Chola Dynasty in South India built the world&#x27;s first temple entirely of granite in the 11th century AD in Tanjore, India. The Brihadeeswarar Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva was built in 1010. The massive Gopuram (ornate, upper section of shrine) is believed to have a mass of around 81 tonnes. It was the tallest temple in south India.

Imperial Roman granite was quarried mainly in Egypt, and also in Turkey, and on the islands of Elba and Giglio. Granite became &quot;an integral part of the Roman language of monumental architecture&quot;. The quarrying ceased around the third century AD. Beginning in Late Antiquity the granite was reused, which since at least the early 16th century became known as spolia. Through the process of case-hardening, granite becomes harder with age. The technology required to make tempered metal chisels was largely forgotten during the Middle Ages. As a result, Medieval stoneworkers were forced to use saws or emery to shorten ancient columns or hack them into discs. Giorgio Vasari noted in the 16th century that granite in quarries was &quot;far softer and easier to work than after it has lain exposed&quot; while ancient columns, because of their &quot;hardness and solidity have nothing to fear from fire or sword, and time itself, that drives everything to ruin, not only has not destroyed them but has not even altered their colour.&quot;

===Modern===

====Sculpture and memorials====
In some areas, granite is used for gravestones and memorials. Granite is a hard stone and requires skill to carve by hand. Until the early 18th century, in the Western world, granite could be carved only by hand tools with generally poor results.

A key breakthrough was the invention of steam-powered cutting and dressing tools by Alexander MacDonald of Aberdeen, inspired by seeing ancient Egyptian granite carvings. In 1832, the first polished tombstone of Aberdeen granite to be erected in an English cemetery was installed at Kensal Green Cemetery. It caused a sensation in the London monumental trade and for some years all polished granite ordered came from MacDonald&#x27;s. As a result of the work of sculptor William Leslie, and later Sidney Field, granite memorials became a major status symbol in Victorian Britain. The royal sarcophagus at Frogmore was probably the pinnacle of its work, and at 30 tons one of the largest. It was not until the 1880s that rival machinery and works could compete with the MacDonald works.

Modern methods of carving include using computer-controlled rotary bits and sandblasting over a rubber stencil. Leaving the letters, numbers, and emblems exposed and the remainder of the stone covered with rubber, the blaster can create virtually any kind of artwork or epitaph.

The stone known as &quot;black granite&quot; is usually gabbro, which has a completely different chemical composition.

====Buildings====

Granite has been extensively used as a dimension stone and as flooring tiles in public and commercial buildings and monuments. Aberdeen in Scotland, which is constructed principally from local granite, is known as &quot;The Granite City&quot;. Because of its abundance in New England, granite was commonly used to build foundations for homes there. The Granite Railway, America&#x27;s first railroad, was built to haul granite from the quarries in Quincy, Massachusetts, to the Neponset River in the 1820s.

====Engineering====
Engineers have traditionally used polished granite surface plates to establish a plane of reference, since they are relatively impervious, inflexible, and maintain good dimensional stability. Sandblasted concrete with a heavy aggregate content has an appearance similar to rough granite, and is often used as a substitute when use of real granite is impractical. Granite tables are used extensively as bases or even as the entire structural body of optical instruments, CMMs, and very high precision CNC machines because of granite&#x27;s rigidity, high dimensional stability, and excellent vibration characteristics. A most unusual use of granite was as the material of the tracks of the Haytor Granite Tramway, Devon, England, in 1820. Granite block is usually processed into slabs, which can be cut and shaped by a cutting center. In military engineering, Finland planted granite boulders along its Mannerheim Line to block invasion by Russian tanks in the Winter War of 1939–40.

====Paving====
Granite is used as a pavement material. This is because it is extremely durable, permeable and requires little maintenance. For example, in Sydney, Australia black granite stone is used for the paving and kerbs throughout the Central Business District.

====Curling stones====

Curling stones are traditionally fashioned of Ailsa Craig granite. The first stones were made in the 1750s, the original source being Ailsa Craig in Scotland. Because of the rarity of this granite, the best stones can cost as much as US$1,500. Between 60 and 70 percent of the stones used today are made from Ailsa Craig granite. Although the island is now a wildlife reserve, it is still quarried under license for Ailsa granite by Kays of Scotland for curling stones.

==Rock climbing==
Granite is one of the rocks most prized by climbers, for its steepness, soundness, crack systems, and friction. Well-known venues for granite climbing include the Yosemite Valley, the Bugaboos, the Mont Blanc massif (and peaks such as the Aiguille du Dru, the Mourne Mountains, the Adamello-Presanella Alps, the Aiguille du Midi and the Grandes Jorasses), the Bregaglia, Corsica, parts of the Karakoram (especially the Trango Towers), the Fitzroy Massif and the Paine Massif in Patagonia, Baffin Island, Ogawayama, the Cornish coast, the Cairngorms, Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the Stawamus Chief, British Columbia, Canada.

<text>The Global Climate Coalition (GCC) (1989–2001) was an international lobbyist group of businesses that opposed action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and engaged in climate change denial, publicly challenging the science behind global warming. The GCC was the largest industry group active in climate policy and the most prominent industry advocate in international climate negotiations. The GCC was involved in opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, and played a role in blocking ratification by the United States. The coalition knew it could not deny the scientific consensus, but sought to sow doubt over the scientific consensus on climate change and create manufactured controversy. 

The GCC was dissolved in 2001 after membership declined in the face of improved understanding of the role of greenhouse gases in climate change and of public criticism. It declared that its primary objective had been achieved: U.S. President George W. Bush withdrew the U.S., which alone accounted for nearly a quarter of the world&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions, from the Kyoto Protocol process through the Senate voting to not ratify the treaty. Thus, this rendered mandatory global reductions unreachable.

== Founding ==
The Global Climate Coalition (GCC) was formed in 1989 as a project under the auspices of the National Association of Manufacturers. The GCC was formed to represent the interests of the major producers and users of fossil fuels, to oppose regulation to mitigate global warming, and to challenge the science behind global warming. Context for the founding of the GCC from 1988 included the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and NASA climatologist James Hansen&#x27;s congressional testimony that climate change was occurring. The government affairs&#x27; offices of five or six corporations recognized that they had been inadequately organized for the Montreal Protocol, the international treaty that phased out ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons, and the Clean Air Act in the United States, and recognized that fossil fuels would be targeted for regulation.

According to GCC&#x27;s mission statement on the home page of its website, GCC was established: &quot;to coordinate business participation in the international policy debate on the issue of global climate change and global warming,&quot; and GCC&#x27;s executive director in a 1993 press release said GCC was organized &quot;as the leading voice for industry on the global climate change issue.&quot;

GCC reorganized independently in 1992, with the first chairman of the board of directors being the director of government relations for the Phillips Petroleum Company. Exxon, later ExxonMobil, was a founding member, and a founding member of the GCC&#x27;s board of directors; the energy giant also had a leadership role in coalition. The American Petroleum Institute (API) was a leading member of the coalition. API&#x27;s executive vice president was a chairman of the coalition&#x27;s board of directors. Other GCC founding members included the National Coal Association, United States Chamber of Commerce, American Forest &amp; Paper Association, and Edison Electric Institute. GCC&#x27;s executive director John Shlaes was previously the director of government relations at the Edison Electric Institute. GCC was run by Ruder Finn, a public relations firm. GCC&#x27;s comprehensive PR campaign was designed by E. Bruce Harrison, who had been creating campaigns for the US industry against environmental legislation from the 1970s.

GCC was the largest industry group active in climate policy. About 40 companies and industry associations were GCC members. Considering member corporations, member trade associations, and business represented by member trade associations, GCC represented over 230,000 businesses. Industry sectors represented included: aluminium, paper, transportation, power generation, petroleum, chemical, and small businesses. All major oil companies were members until 1996 (Shell left in 1998). GCC members were from industries that would have been adversely effected by limitations on fossil fuel consumption. GCC was funded by membership dues.

== Advocacy activities ==
GCC was one of the most powerful lobbyist groups against action to mitigate global warming. It was the most prominent industry advocate in international climate negotiations, and led a campaign opposed to policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The GCC was one of the most powerful non-governmental organizations representing business interests in climate policy, according to Kal Raustiala, professor at the UCLA School of Law.

GCC&#x27;s advocacy activities included lobbying government officials, grassroots lobbying through press releases and advertising, participation in international climate conferences, criticism of the processes of international climate organizations, critiques of climate models, and personal attacks on scientists and environmentalists. Policy positions advocated by the coalition included denial of anthropogenic climate change, emphasizing the uncertainty in climatology, advocating for additional research, highlighting the benefits and downplaying the risks of climate change, stressing the priority of economic development, defending national sovereignty, and opposition to the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.

GCC sent delegations to all of the major international climate conventions. Only nations and non-profits may send official delegates to the United Nations Climate Change conferences. GCC registered with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as a non-governmental organization, and executives from GCC members attended official UN conferences as GCC delegates.

In 1990, after US president, George H. W. Bush, addressed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) urging caution in responding to global warming, and offering no new proposals, GCC said Bush&#x27;s speech was &quot;very strong&quot; and concurred with the priorities of economic development and additional research. GCC sent 30 attendees to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, where it lobbied to keep targets and timetables out of the Framework Convention on Climate Change. In December, 1992 GCC&#x27;s executive director wrote in a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;...there is considerable debate on whether or not man-made greenhouse gases (produced primarily by burning fossil fuels) are triggering a dangerous &#x27;global warming&#x27; trend.&quot; In 1992 GCC distributed a half-hour video entitled &quot;The Greening of Planet Earth&quot;, to hundreds of journalists, the White House, and several Middle Eastern oil-producing countries, which suggested that increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide could boost crop yields and solve world hunger.

In 1993, after then US president Bill Clinton pledged &quot;to reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels by the year 2000,&quot; GCC&#x27;s executive director said it &quot;could jeopardize the economic health of the nation.&quot; GCC&#x27;s lobbying was key to the defeat in the United States Senate of Clinton&#x27;s 1993 BTU tax proposal. In 1994, after United States Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O&#x27;Leary said the 1992 UNFCCC needed to be strengthened, and that voluntary carbon dioxide reductions may not be enough, GCC said it was: &quot;disturbed by the implication that the President&#x27;s voluntary climate action plan, which is just getting under way, will be inadequate and that more stringent measures may be needed domestically.&quot;

GCC did not fund original scientific research and its climate claims relied largely on the &quot;World Climate Review&quot; and its successor the &quot;World Climate Report&quot; edited by Patrick Michaels and funded by the Western Fuels Association. GCC promoted the views of climate deniers such as Michaels, Fred Singer, and Richard Lindzen. In 1996, GCC published a report entitled &quot;Global warming and extreme weather: fact vs. fiction&quot; written by Robert E. Davis.

GCC members questioned the efficacy of climate change denial and shifted their message to highlighting the economic costs of proposed greenhouse gas emission regulations and the limited effectiveness of proposals exempting developing nations. In 1995, after the United Nations Climate Change conference in Berlin agreed to negotiate greenhouse gas emission limits, GCC&#x27;s executive director said the agreement gave &quot;developing countries like China, India and Mexico a free ride&quot; and would &quot;change the relations between sovereign countries and the United Nations. This could have very significant implications. It could be a way of capping our economy.&quot; At a Washington, D.C. press conference on the eve of the second United Nations Climate Change conference in Geneva, GCC&#x27;s executive director said, &quot;The time for decision is not yet now.&quot; At the conference in Geneva, GCC issued a statement that said it was too early to determine the causes of global warming. GCC representatives lobbied scientists at the September, 1996 IPCC conference in Mexico City.

After actor Leonardo DiCaprio, chairman of Earth Day 2000, interviewed Clinton for ABC News, GCC sent out an e-mail that said that DiCaprio&#x27;s first car was a Jeep Grand Cherokee and that his current car was a Chevrolet Tahoe.

=== &quot;Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer&quot; ===
In 1995, GCC assembled an advisory committee of scientific and technical experts to compile an internal-only, 17-page report on climate science entitled &quot;Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer&quot;, which said: &quot;The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and the potential impact of human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied.&quot; In early 1996, GCC&#x27;s operating committee asked the advisory committee to redact the sections that rebutted contrarian arguments, and accepted the report and distributed it to members. The draft document was disclosed in a 2007 lawsuit filed by the auto industry against California&#x27;s efforts to regulate automotive greenhouse gas emissions.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the primer demonstrated that &quot;even as the coalition worked to sway opinion, its own scientific and technical experts were advising that the science backing the role of greenhouse gases in global warming could not be refuted.&quot; According to the Union of Concerned Scientists in 2015, the primer was: &quot;remarkable for indisputably showing that, while some fossil fuel companies&#x27; deception about climate science has continued to the present day, at least two decades ago the companies&#x27; own scientific experts were internally alerting them about the realities and implications of climate change.&quot;

=== IPCC Second Assessment Report ===
GCC was an industry participant in the review process of the IPCC Second Assessment Report. In 1996, prior to the publication of the Second Assessment Report, GCC distributed a report entitled &quot;The IPCC: Institutionalized Scientific Cleansing&quot; to reporters, US Congressmen, and scientists. The coalition report said that Benjamin D. Santer, the lead author of Chapter 8 in the assessment, entitled &quot;Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes,&quot; had altered the text, after acceptance by the Working Group, and without approval of the authors, to strike content characterizing the uncertainty of the science. Frederick Seitz repeated GCC&#x27;s charges in a letter to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published June 12, 1996. The coalition ran newspaper advertisements that said: &quot;unless the management of the IPCC promptly undertakes to republish the printed versions ... the IPCC&#x27;s credibility will have been lost.&quot;

Santer and his co-authors said the edits were integrations of comments from peer review as per agreed IPCC processes.

=== Opposition to Kyoto Protocol ===
GCC was the main industry group in the United States opposed to the Kyoto Protocol, which committed signatories to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The coalition &quot;was the leading industry group working in opposition to the Kyoto Protocol,&quot; according to Greenpeace, and led opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times.&quot;

Prior to 1997, GCC spent about $1 million annually lobbying against limits on emissions; before Kyoto, GCC annual revenue peaked around $1.5 million; GCC spent $13 million on advertising in opposition to the Kyoto treaty. The coalition funded the Global Climate Information Project and hired the advertising firm that produced the 1993–1994 Harry and Louise advertising campaign which opposed Clinton&#x27;s health care initiative. The advertisements said, &quot;the UN Climate Treaty isn&#x27;t Global...and it won&#x27;t work&quot; and &quot;Americans will pay the price...50 cents more for every gallon of gasoline.&quot;

GCC opposed the signing of the Kyoto Protocol by Clinton. GCC was influential in the withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol by the administration of President George W. Bush. According to briefing notes prepared by the United States Department of State for the under-secretary of state, Bush&#x27;s rejection of the Kyoto Protocol was &quot;in part based on input from&quot; GCC. GCC lobbying was key to the July, 1997 unanimous passage in the United States Senate of the Byrd–Hagel Resolution, which reflected the coalition&#x27;s position that restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions must include developing countries. GCC&#x27;s chairman told a US congressional committee that mandatory greenhouse gas emissions limits were: &quot;an unjustified rush to judgement.&quot; The coalition sent 50 delegates to the third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Kyoto. On December 11, 1997, the day the Kyoto delegates reached agreement on legally binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions, GCC&#x27;s chairman said the agreement would be defeated by the US Senate. In 2001, GCC&#x27;s executive director compared the Kyoto Protocol to the &quot;RMS Titanic&quot;.

== Membership decline ==
GCC&#x27;s challenge to science prompted a backlash from environmental groups. Environmentalists described GCC as a &quot;club for polluters&quot; and called for members to withdraw their support. &quot;Abandonment of the Global Climate Coalition by leading companies is partly in response to the mounting evidence that the world is indeed getting warmer,&quot; according to environmentalist Lester R. Brown. In 1998, Green Party delegates to the European Parliament introduced an unsuccessful proposal that the World Meteorological Organization name hurricanes after GCC members. Defections weakened the coalition. In 1996, British Petroleum resigned and later announced support for the Kyoto Protocol and commitment to greenhouse gas emission reductions. In 1997, Royal Dutch Shell withdrew after criticism from European environmental groups. In 1999, Ford Motor Company was the first US company to withdraw; the &quot;New York Times&quot; described the departure as &quot;the latest sign of divisions within heavy industry over how to respond to global warming.&quot; DuPont left the coalition in 1997 and Shell USA (then known as Shell Oil Company) left in 1998. In 2000, GCC corporate members were the targets of a national student-run university divestiture campaign. Between December, 1999 and early March, 2000, Texaco, the Southern Company, General Motors and Daimler-Chrysler withdrew. Some former coalition members joined the Business Environmental Leadership Council within the Pew Center on Global Climate Change which represented diverse stakeholders, including business interests, with a commitment to peer-reviewed scientific research and accepted the need for emissions restrictions to address climate change.

In 2000, GCC restructured as an association of trade associations; membership was limited to trade associations, and individual corporations were represented through their trade association. Brown called the restructuring &quot;a thinly veiled effort to conceal the real issue – the loss of so many key corporate members.&quot;

== Dissolution ==
After US President George W. Bush withdrew the US from the Kyoto process in 2001, GCC disbanded. Absent the participation of the US, the effectiveness of the Kyoto process was limited. GCC said on its website that its mission had been successfully achieved, writing &quot;At this point, both Congress and the Administration agree that the U.S. should not accept the mandatory cuts in emissions required by the protocol.&quot; Networks of well-funded industry lobbyists and other climate change denial groups continue its work.

== Reception ==
In 2015, the Union of Concerned Scientists compared GCC&#x27;s role in the public policy debate on climate change to the roles in the public policy debate on tobacco safety of the Tobacco Institute, the tobacco industry&#x27;s lobbyist group, and the Council for Tobacco Research, which promoted misleading science. Environmentalist Bill McKibben said that, by promoting doubt about the science, &quot;throughout the 1990s, even as other nations took action, the fossil fuel industry&#x27;s Global Climate Coalition managed to make American journalists treat the accelerating warming as a he-said-she-said story.&quot; According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, GCC members integrated projections from climate models into their operational planning while publicly criticising the models.

Former Vice President Al Gore described the oil companies&#x27; blocking campaign as &quot;the most serious crime of the post-World War Two era&quot;.

<text>Gotham City ( ), or simply Gotham, is a fictional city in the Northeastern United States that serves as the primary city appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. It is best known as the home of the superhero Batman and his allies and foes. Created by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane, the city was first identified as Batman&#x27;s place of residence in &quot;Batman&quot; #4 (December 1940) and has since been the primary setting for stories featuring the character. In most of its incarnations, Gotham is depicted as one of the most crime-ridden cities in the world.

Gotham City is traditionally depicted as being located in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Gotham&#x27;s look and atmosphere were primarily influenced by New York City, but also drew inspiration from Chicago and London. Architect Hugh Ferriss&#x27; designs also influenced the look and emotional feel of Gotham City, particularly in its later depictions. Bill Finger said that he chose the name &quot;Gotham&quot;, and not New York, so that all readers in any city could identify with it.

Locations used as inspiration or filming locations for Gotham City in the live-action &quot;Batman&quot; films and television series have included St. Louis, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, London, Glasgow, Hong Kong, Detroit, and Liverpool.

==Origin of name==
In Jim Steranko&#x27;s &quot;History of the Comics&quot;, writer Bill Finger, on the naming of the city, said, &quot;Originally I was going to call Gotham City &#x27;Civic City.&#x27; Then I tried &#x27;Capital City,&#x27; then &#x27;Coast City.&#x27; Then I flipped through the New York City phone book and spotted the name &#x27;Gotham Jewelers&#x27; and said, &#x27;That&#x27;s it,&#x27; Gotham City. We didn&#x27;t call it New York because we wanted anybody in any city to identify with it.&quot;

&quot;Gotham&quot; has been a nickname for New York City that first became popular in the 19th century; Washington Irving had first attached it to New York in the November 11, 1807, edition of his &quot;Salmagundi&quot;, a periodical which lampooned New York culture and politics. Irving took the name from the English village of Gotham, Nottinghamshire, which was known for the Wise Men of Gotham story, a legendary incident where the village&#x27;s residents feigned idiocy to prevent a royal visit from John, King of England.

==Geography==
===Location in New Jersey===

Gotham City, like other cities in the DC Universe, has varied in its portrayals over the decades, but the city&#x27;s location is traditionally depicted as being in the state of New Jersey. In &quot;Amazing World of DC Comics&quot; #14 (March 1977), writer Mark Gruenwald discusses the history of the Justice League and indicates that Gotham City is located in New Jersey.

In &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Super Heroes&quot; (August 13, 1978) comic strip, a map is shown placing Gotham City in New Jersey and Metropolis in Delaware. &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #259 (November 1979) also confirms that Gotham is in New Jersey. &quot;The New Adventures of Superboy&quot; #22 (October 1981) and the 1990 &quot;Atlas of the DC Universe&quot; both show maps of Gotham City in New Jersey and Metropolis in the state of Delaware.

&quot;Detective Comics&quot; #503 (June 1983) includes several references suggesting Gotham City is in New Jersey. A location on the Jersey Shore is described as &quot;20 miles north of Gotham&quot;. Within the same issue, Robin and Batgirl drive from a &quot;secret New Jersey airfield&quot; to Gotham City and then drive on the &quot;Hudson County Highway&quot;, a reference to the real-life Hudson County in New Jersey.

&quot;Batman: Shadow of the Bat&quot; Annual #1 (June 1993) further establishes that Gotham City is in New Jersey. Sal E. Jordan&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license in the comic shows his address as &quot;72 Faxcol Dr Gotham City, NJ 12345&quot;, although the ZIP Code is actually in Schenectady, New York.

The 2016 film &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; reveals Gotham City to be in the state of New Jersey within the DC Extended Universe.

Both 2022&#x27;s &quot;The Batman&quot;, and its 2024 TV spinoff &quot;The Penguin&quot; have Gotham City in New Jersey as can be seen with in-universe drivers licenses.

However, 2024&#x27;s &quot;&quot; places Gotham City in New York as Joker&#x27;s trial is titled &quot;The State of New York vs. Arthur Fleck&quot;.

===In relation to Metropolis===

Gotham City is the home of Batman, just as Metropolis is home to Superman, and the two heroes often work together in both cities. In comic book depictions, the exact distance between Gotham and Metropolis has varied over the years, with the cities usually being within driving distance of each other. The two cities are sometimes portrayed as twin cities on opposite sides of the Delaware Bay, with Gotham in New Jersey and Metropolis in Delaware. &quot;The Atlas of the DC Universe&quot; from the 1990s places Metropolis in Delaware and Gotham City in New Jersey.

New York has also garnered the nickname &quot;Metropolis&quot; to describe the city in the daytime in popular culture, contrasting with &quot;Gotham&quot;, sometimes used to describe New York City at night. During the Bronze Age of Comic Books, the Metro-Narrows Bridge was depicted as the main route connecting the twin cities of Metropolis and Gotham City. It has been described as being the longest suspension bridge in the world.

A map appeared in &quot;The New Adventures of Superboy&quot; #22 (October 1981), that showed Smallville within driving distance of both Metropolis and Gotham City; Smallville was relocated to Kansas in post-Crisis continuity. A map of the United States in &quot;The Secret Files &amp; Origins Guide to the DC Universe 2000&quot; #1 (March 2000) depicts Metropolis and Gotham City as being somewhere in the Tri-state Area alongside Blüdhaven.

Within the DC Extended Universe, the 2016 film &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; depicts Gotham City as being located across a bay from Metropolis.

==History==
Gotham City was founded in 1635 by Captain Jon Logerquist, a Norwegian mercenary, before subsequently being taken over by the English; this parallels the history of New York City, which was founded by the Dutch as New Amsterdam before being conquered by England and renamed New York. During the American Revolutionary War, Gotham City was the site of a major battle between American and British forces (paralleling the real-life Battle of Long Island). This was detailed in Rick Veitch&#x27;s &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #85 featuring Tomahawk. Rumors held it to be the site of various occult rites.

The 2011 comic book series &quot;&quot; details a history of Gotham City in which Alan Wayne (Bruce Wayne&#x27;s ancestor), Theodore Cobblepot (Oswald Cobblepot&#x27;s ancestor), and Edward Elliot (Thomas Elliot&#x27;s ancestor), are considered as the founding fathers of Gotham. In 1881, they constructed three bridges called the Gates of Gotham, each bearing one of their last names. Edward Elliot became increasingly jealous of the Wayne family&#x27;s popularity and wealth during this period, jealousy that would spread to his great-great-grandson, Thomas Elliot or Hush.

The occult origins of Gotham are further delved into by Peter Milligan&#x27;s 1990 story arc &quot;Dark Knight, Dark City&quot;, which reveals that some of the Founding Fathers of the United States are involved in summoning a bat-demon which becomes trapped beneath old &quot;Gotham Town&quot;, its dark influence spreading as Gotham City evolves. A similar trend is followed in 2005&#x27;s &quot;Shadowpact&quot; #5 by Bill Willingham, which expands upon Gotham&#x27;s occult heritage by revealing a being who has slept for 40,000 years beneath the land upon which Gotham City was built. Strega, the being&#x27;s servant, says that the &quot;dark and often cursed character&quot; of the city was influenced by the being who now uses the name &quot;Doctor Gotham.&quot; In &quot;Gotham Underground&quot; #2 by Frank Tieri, Tobias Whale claims that 19th century Gotham was run by five rival gangs, until the first &quot;masks&quot; appeared, eventually forming a gang of their own. It is not clear whether these were vigilantes or costumed criminals.

Many storylines have added more events to Gotham&#x27;s history, at the same time greatly affecting the city and its people. Perhaps the greatest in effect was a long set of serial storylines, which started with Ra&#x27;s al Ghul releasing a debilitating virus called the &quot;Clench&quot; during the &quot;&quot; storyline. As that arc concluded, the city was beginning to recover, only to suffer an earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter Scale in the 1998 &quot;&quot; storyline. This resulted in the federal government cutting Gotham off from the rest of the United States in the 1999 storyline &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, the city&#x27;s remaining residents forced to engage in gang warfare, either as active participants or paying for protection from groups ranging from the GCPD to the Penguin, just to stay alive. Eventually, Gotham was rebuilt and returned to the U.S. as part of a campaign mounted by Lex Luthor, who used the positive publicity of his role to make a successful bid for the position of President of the United States. Suggestions of other Gotham City histories include a founding date of 1820 seen in a city seal in &quot;&quot;.

==Culture==
&quot;Batman&quot; writer and editor Dennis O&#x27;Neil has said that, figuratively, Batman&#x27;s Gotham City is akin to &quot;Manhattan below 14th Street at eleven minutes past midnight on the coldest night in November&quot;. Batman artist Neal Adams has long believed that Chicago has been the basis for Gotham, stating &quot;one of the things about Chicago is Chicago has alleys (which are virtually nonexistent in New York). Back alleys, that&#x27;s where Batman fights all the bad guys.&quot; The statement &quot;Metropolis is New York by day; Gotham City is New York by night&quot; has been variously attributed to comics creators Frank Miller and John Byrne.
In designing &quot;&quot;, creators Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski emulated the Tim Burton films&#x27; &quot;otherworldly timelessness,&quot; incorporating period features such as black-and-white title cards, police airships (although no such thing existed, Timm has stated that he found it to fit the show&#x27;s style), and a &quot;vintage&quot; color scheme with film noir flourishes. Police airships have since been incorporated into Batman comic books and are a recurring element in Gotham City.

Concerning the evolution of Gotham throughout the years, former &quot;Batman&quot; editor Paul Levitz has stated, &quot;Each guy adds their own vision. That&#x27;s the fun of comics, rebuilding a city each time&quot;.

===Architecture===

In &quot;&quot;, Gotham Cathedral plays a central role in the story since it is built by Mr. Whisper, the story&#x27;s antagonist.

In a 1992 storyline, a man obsessed with Pinkney&#x27;s architecture destroys several Gotham buildings to reveal the Pinkney structures they had hidden; the editorial purpose behind this was to make Gotham resemble its depiction in the 1989 &quot;Batman&quot; film.

&quot;Batman Begins&quot; features a CGI-augmented version of Chicago while &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; more directly features Chicago infrastructure and architecture such as Navy Pier. &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; forgoes Chicago, instead shooting in Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, New Jersey, London, and Glasgow.

==Notable residents==
Over the years, in various Batman-related titles in the chronological DC Comics continuity, the Caped Crusader enlists the help of numerous characters, the first being his trusty sidekick, Robin. Although a singular title, many have donned the mantle over the years. The first being Nightwing, then came Red Hood, Red Robin, Spoiler and finally Batman&#x27;s son Damian Wayne. In addition to the Robins or former Robins, there is also Catwoman, Batgirl (Barbara Gordon), Batgirl (Cassandra Cain), Signal, Batwing, Batwoman, and Huntress.

Other DC characters have also been depicted to be living in Gotham, including the hitman Tommy Monaghan; Jason Blood, the host of the demon Etrigan; the Green Lantern Alan Scott; the original Spectre (Jim Corrigan); Black Canary; Starman; and the Grey Ghost.

DC&#x27;s 2011 reboot of &quot;All Star Western&quot; takes place in an Old West-styled Gotham. Jonah Hex and Amadeus Arkham are among this version of Gotham&#x27;s inhabitants.

Apart from Gotham&#x27;s superhero residents, the residents of the city feature in a back-up series in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; called &quot;Tales of Gotham City&quot; and in two limited series called &quot;Gotham Nights&quot;. Additionally, the Gotham City Police Department is the focus of the series &quot;Gotham Central&quot;, as well as the mini-series &quot;Gordon&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;Bullock&#x27;s Law&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

===Mayors===
The first Gotham mayor depicted in comics was in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #68 (October 1942). Theodore Cobblepot, great-grandfather of the Penguin, was mayor in the late 19th century. An unnamed mayor encountered the Court of Owls in 1914 and was killed by them. Archibald Brewster was mayor during the Great Depression. Mayor Thorndike was killed by the Made of Wood killer in 1948. Mayor Aubrey James was a contemporary of Thomas Wayne who was stabbed to death. Mayor Jessop was in office shortly after the Wayne murders. A man named Falcone was purportedly mayor during the earliest days of Batman&#x27;s career. Shortly after, Mayor Wilson Klass directed the GCPD to turn a blind eye to Batman&#x27;s activities after Batman saved his daughter. Hamilton Hill was in office when the Joker debuted, and a man named Gill was mayor early in Batman&#x27;s career, as was former police commissioner Grogan. An unnamed bald mayor was killed by a villain known as Midnight. Men named Carfax, Bradley Stokes, Sheppard, Taylor, and Hayes all served as mayor. Mayor Charles Chesterfield was killed by a sentient fat-eating blob of grease.

Hamilton Hill became mayor through the backing of crime boss Rupert Thorne but was ultimately ousted from office and replaced by George P. Skowcroft. An unnamed mayor is killed by Deacon Blackfire&#x27;s followers and replaced by Donald Webster. Mayor Julius Lieberman is killed by a Predator. Mayor Goode served briefly before being replaced by an African American man. Armand Krol became mayor and died of the Clench virus after leaving office. A woman, Marion Grange, became mayor with the backing of Bruce Wayne but was assassinated in Washington, D.C., while trying to secure federal aid for Gotham after an earthquake. In the wake of , Daniel Danforth Dickerson III served as mayor only to be killed by a sniper, after which he was replaced by David Hull. Seamus McGreevy served as mayor in the midst of a criminal conspiracy known as &quot;The Body&quot;. An unnamed woman was mayor when Batman returned to Gotham a year after &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. Sebastian Hady was a corrupt mayor who was eventually killed by the League of Shadows. Councilwoman Muir served as interim mayor when the city was in the grip of a virus that only affected men. Michael Akins, former commissioner of police, was appointed mayor, and later replaced by a man named Atkins. In the wake of Bane&#x27;s takeover of the city, a man named Dunch served as mayor, and in the aftermath of the Joker War, anti-vigilante mayoral candidate Christopher Nakano wins election in a landslide.

==In other media==
===Television===
In multiple episodes of the 1960s live-action &quot;Batman&quot; television series, Batman is seen consulting a transparent map of Gotham, which is an inverted map of St. Louis.

The live-action TV series &quot;Gotham&quot; was filmed in New York City and was an important requirement of the show&#x27;s creative team. According to executive producer Danny Cannon, its atmosphere was inspired by the look of New York in the 1970s films of Sidney Lumet and William Friedkin. Clues to this include and signs showing phone numbers bearing the area code 212. Donal Logue, who portrayed Harvey Bullock, described different aspects of that series&#x27; design of Gotham City as exhibiting different sensibilities, explaining, &quot;for me, you can step into things that almost feel like the roaring 20s, and then there&#x27;s this other really kind of heavy &quot;Blade Runner&quot; vibe floating around. There are elements of it that are completely contemporary and there are pieces of it that are very old-fashioned...There were a couple of examples of modern technology, but maybe an antiquated version of it, that gave me a little bit of sense that it&#x27;s certainly not the 50s and the 60s...But it&#x27;s not high tech and it&#x27;s not futuristic, by any means.&quot;

The fifth episode of &quot;Young Justice&quot;, entitled &quot;Schooled&quot;, indicates that Gotham is located in Connecticut, near Bridgeport.

The 2019 series &quot;Batwoman&quot;, which is set in Gotham City, was filmed in Chicago.

The 2024 series &quot;The Penguin&quot; is set in Gotham City.

====DC Animated Universe====

Gotham City is featured heavily in &quot;&quot;. When describing Gotham City Paul Dini, a writer and director of the show, stated &quot;In my mind, it was sort of like what if the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair had gone on another 60 years or so&quot;.&#x27; In the episode &quot;Joker&#x27;s Favor&quot;, a driver&#x27;s license lists a Gotham area resident&#x27;s hometown as &quot;Gotham Estates, NY&quot;. In the episode &quot;Avatar&quot;, when Bruce Wayne leaves for England, a map shows Gotham City, at the joining of Long Island and the Hudson River. The episode &quot;Fire from Olympus&quot; shows a character&#x27;s address in a police file indicating that Gotham City is located in New York state. The episode &quot;The Mechanic&quot;, however, implies that Gotham resides in a state of the same name; a prison workshop is shown stamping license plates that read &quot;Gotham: The Dark Deco State&quot; (as a reference to the artistic style of the series). The episode &quot;Harlequinade&quot; states that Gotham has a population of approximately 10 million.

&quot;Batman Beyond&quot; (1999–2001) envisions a Gotham City in 2039, referred to as &quot;Neo-Gotham&quot;.

====Arrowverse====

Gotham City was first shown in the Arrowverse as part of &quot;Elseworlds&quot;, a 2018 crossover storyline among the shows, which introduced Batwoman, although it had been referred to several times previously.

In &quot;The Flash&quot; episode &quot;Marathon&quot;, a map shows Gotham City in place of Chicago, Illinois.

====Theme parks====
Themed lands meant to represent Gotham City have been physically constructed in several different theme parks around the world. WB Movie World in Germany featured a Gotham City section that housed Batman Adventure – The Ride, and Six Flags Magic Mountain opened a section called the &quot;Gotham City Backlot&quot; that featured . The section featured at Magic Mountain was designed by park designer Kevin Barbee, and alongside the opening of Batman: The Ride coincided with the largest expansion the park had ever undergone in 23 years, with the theming elements primarily having been inspired by the &quot;Batman&quot; films directed by Tim Burton. Both the ride and the Gotham City Backlot opened on March 26, 1994.

The Magic Mountain section closed at the end of the park&#x27;s 2010 season and was later rethemed and rebranded as the &quot;DC Universe,&quot; featuring characters and attractions outside of just Batman. It reopened in 2011.

Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi features a section themed after Gotham City, including rides based on Batman, the Riddler and the Scarecrow as well as a walk-through attraction called &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Funhouse.&quot; The park and its Gotham City section were designed by Thinkwell Group. DC characters as they appear in both the attractions themselves as well as through live performers feature costumes based on The New 52 comic book relaunch from 2011. The Gotham City section neighbors another section themed after Metropolis, home of Superman.

===Films===
====1989 Batman series====
&quot;Batman&quot; (1989) director Tim Burton wanted a timeless alternative to New York and described it as &quot;hell burst through the pavement and grew&quot;. The look of Gotham was overseen by production designer Anton Furst, who won an Oscar for supervising the art department. Furst stated &quot;Batman&quot; was &quot;definitely based in many ways on the worst aspects of New York City&quot; and was inspired by Andreas Feininger&#x27;s photographs of 1940s New York. Furst&#x27;s draftsman Nigel Phelps created numerous charcoal drawings of the buildings and interior sets for the production.

Following the death of Furst, Burton tapped Bo Welch to oversee production design for &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992). Burton wanted Welch to re-imagine Gotham, stating &quot;&quot;Batman&quot; didn&#x27;t feel big to me – it didn&#x27;t have the power an old American city has&quot;. Welch wanted to expand on the same basic concept for the sequel but moved away from European influences to show more American Art Deco/world&#x27;s fair elements. When asked what inspired his interpretation of Gotham, Welch stated &quot;[H]ow can I create a visual expression of corruption and greed? That got me thinking about the fascistic architecture employed at world&#x27;s fairs... That feels corrupt because it&#x27;s evocative of oppressive bureaucracies and dictatorships... So I looked at a lot of [Third Reich] art and images from world&#x27;s fairs&quot;. To physically make the city seem darker, he designed tall &quot;oppressively overbuilt&quot; cityscape that physically blocked out light.

When Joel Schumacher took over directing the &quot;Batman&quot; film series from Tim Burton, Barbara Ling handled the production design for both of Schumacher&#x27;s films, &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995) and 1997&#x27;s &quot;Batman &amp; Robin.&quot; Ling&#x27;s vision of Gotham City was a luminous and outlandish evocation of modern Expressionism and Constructivism. Its futuristic design, which &quot;Washington Post&quot; critic Desson Howe felt evoked the 1982 film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, were described by Ling in her book, &quot;Bigger, Bolder, Brighter: The Production Design of Batman &amp; Robin&quot; as a cross between 1930s Manhattan and the &quot;Neo-Tokyo&quot; of &quot;Akira&quot;. Ling cited &quot;neon-ridden Tokyo and the Machine Age as her influences, describing her Gotham as &quot;like a World&#x27;s Fair on ecstasy.&quot; When Batman is pursuing Two-Face in &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, the chase ends at Lady Gotham, the fictional equivalent of the Statue of Liberty. During Mr. Freeze&#x27;s attempt to freeze Gotham in the film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, the targeting screen for his giant laser locates it somewhere on the New England shoreline, possibly as far north as Maine. The soundtrack for &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; features a song named after the city and sung by R. Kelly, later included on international editions of his 1998 double album &quot;R.&quot;

====The &quot;Dark Knight&quot; trilogy====

Director Christopher Nolan has stated that Chicago inspired his portrayal of Gotham, and the majority of both &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008) were filmed there. However, Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Gotham City was deliberately set in New Jersey to honor Gotham&#x27;s location in the comic books.

For &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, Nolan desired that Gotham appear as a large, modern city that nonetheless reflects a variety of architectural styles and periods, as well as different socioeconomic strata. The production&#x27;s approach depicted Gotham as an exaggeration of New York City, with elements taken from Chicago, the elevated freeways and monorails of Tokyo, and the &quot;walled city of Kalhoon&quot; in Hong Kong, which was the basis for the slum in the film known as The Narrows.

In &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, more Chicago and New York influences were observed. On filming in Chicago, James McAllister, key location manager stated, &quot;visually it&#x27;s that look like you would see in the comic books.&quot; Nolan also stated &quot;there&#x27;s all these different boroughs, with rivers to interconnect. I think it&#x27;s hard to get away from that, because Gotham is based on New York.&quot;

For &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012), the production utilized Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, New Jersey, London and Glasgow, Toronto for shots of Gotham City.

====DC Extended Universe====

Within the DC Extended Universe, Gotham City is located in Gotham County, New Jersey. In &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;, paperwork mentions that the city is in &quot;Gotham County,&quot; and Amanda Waller&#x27;s files on Deadshot and Harley Quinn in &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; reveal Gotham City to be located in the state of New Jersey. Zack Snyder confirmed that Metropolis and Gotham City are in close geographical proximity to each other. The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; compared the close proximity of Gotham City and Metropolis to Jersey City and Manhattan. A television ad for Turkish Airlines that premiered during the 2016 Super Bowl featured Bruce Wayne (played by Ben Affleck) promoting Gotham as a tourist destination.

To create Gotham in &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;, the creative team &quot;decided to recreate and combine large sections of existing selected city sections and adapt the architecture and layout to fit Gotham&#x27;s. Thousands of photographs were put through MPC&#x27;s photogrammetry pipeline to create geometry and textures for each city section.&quot;

In &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, which takes place in Gotham, the entire shoot took place in Los Angeles. It was originally expected to be filmed in Atlanta and Savannah, Georgia, but the production received a tax credit from California, incentivizing the location change.

====&quot;The Batman&quot;====

The 2022 Matt Reeves film &quot;The Batman&quot; delves into the criminal underbelly of Gotham City through noir-style storytelling and highlights themes of corruption rampant within the city&#x27;s government and police department. The film used London, Glasgow, Liverpool, and Chicago as filming locations for Gotham City, although it was modeled on New York City. A towering skyscraper similar to the Empire State Building looms over Gotham City with an emblazoned sign that reads &quot;Gotham Empire&quot;. A busy, commercial intersection called &quot;Gotham Square&quot; is seen in several shots and resembles Times Square with its bright signs and giant digital screens. The film&#x27;s concluding sequence, while filmed at London&#x27;s O2 Arena, is called &quot;Gotham Square Garden&quot;, taking its naming convention from New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden.

====&quot;Joker&quot; (2019) and &quot;Joker: Folie à Deux&quot; (2024)====

&quot;Joker&quot; director and producer Todd Phillips imagined Gotham as a &quot;version of Gotham was the pre-&#x27;80s boom New York, or urban northeastern center, but not the iconic New York.&quot; When asked how he re-imagined the city, production designer Mark Friedberg stated &quot;our version of Gotham was what groomed him. It was both an appreciation for how severe things got in the city, but also for the world of possibility that lived in the version of that city.&quot; The film shot on location and used landmarks in New York City, Jersey City and Newark, New Jersey. In &quot;&quot;, Gotham is explicitly stated to be in New York state.

====Animated films====
During the events of the direct-to-video film &quot;Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero&quot; (1998), a computer screen displaying Barbara Gordon&#x27;s personal information refers to her location as &quot;Gotham City, NY&quot;, and also displays her area code as being 212 – a Manhattan area code.

The 2008 direct-to-DVD film &quot;&quot; shows Gotham as a large city with many skyscrapers and a bustling population.

===Video games===
Gotham City appears in several video games, including &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, &quot;DC Universe Online&quot;, &quot;Gotham Knights&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot;. The city makes another appearance in a video game with &quot;&quot;, where the player can fight outside or inside of Wayne Manor, on top of a building and in an alley. Other games that feature the city include &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot; and Rocksteady&#x27;s &quot;Arkham&quot; franchise.
Gotham City appears as a location in the 2017 video game &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot; as part of a crossover in commemoration of Batman&#x27;s 80th anniversary. It was the fourth incarnation of the game&#x27;s iconic Tilted Towers area. Players are able to use the Batglider after falling from a great height, as long as they remain in the confines of Gotham City. The location was removed on October 13, 2019, during the game&#x27;s &quot;The End&quot; live event, in which it was sucked into a Black Hole along with the rest of the &quot;Fortnite&quot; Chapter 1 Island. The assets used for Gotham City, devoid of any Batman branding, are featured in &quot;Fortnite Creative&quot; under the name &quot;Dark Tilted&quot;.

====Batman: Arkham====

&quot;&quot; (2009) opens with Batman driving Joker from Gotham City to Arkham Asylum. Joker also threatens to detonate bombs across Gotham. In &quot;&quot; (2011), the slums of Old Gotham City (the northern island) were converted into Arkham City. Inside the prison walls, this part of Gotham contains various landmarks throughout the story, like Penguin&#x27;s Iceberg Lounge, the Ace Chemical Plant, the Sionis Steel Mill, the Old Gotham City Police Department building, and the Monarch Theatre with the Wayne murder scene in Crime Alley. Most of these locations have major events in the story. In &quot;&quot; (2013), an earlier, younger version of the city can be seen than that of other games in the &quot;Batman: Arkham&quot; series. In addition to the northern island, this installment in the series lets players explore a new southern island, connected to the former by the Pioneer&#x27;s Bridge. The setting of &quot;&quot; (2015), Central Gotham City, is five times larger than Old Gotham. In the novelization for &quot;Batman: Arkham Knight&quot;, it is revealed that Crime Alley was later renamed Wayne Way months after the &#x27;death&#x27; of Batman.

<text>Charles Henry Goren (March 4, 1901 – April 3, 1991) was an American bridge player and writer who significantly developed and popularized the game. He was the leading American bridge personality in the 1950s and 1960s and widely known as &quot;Mr. Bridge&quot;. 

==Early years==

Goren was born in what is now Khotyn, Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire, to a Jewish family. His parents were Jacob and Rebecca Goron, a writer and a homemaker. His father emigrated in 1903 with the family possibly coming later. He earned a law degree at McGill University in Montreal in 1923. While he was attending McGill, a girlfriend (or &quot;a young hostess&quot;) laughed at his ineptness at the game of bridge, thus motivating him to immerse himself in a study of existing bridge materials.

After graduation, he practiced law for 13 years in Philadelphia. The growing fame of contract bridge player Ely Culbertson, however, prompted Goren to abandon his original career choice to pursue bridge competitions, where he attracted the attention of Milton Work, an American authority on many card games including contract bridge. Work was impressed by Goren&#x27;s knowledge of the game and hired Goren to help him write his bridge articles and columns.

Work was one of many strong bridge players based in Philadelphia around the 1920s. By 1928 he had popularized the 4–3–2–1 point count system for evaluating balanced hands (now sometimes called the Work count). His chief assistant Olive Peterson and young Goren established a partnership as players.

As a player Goren&#x27;s &quot;breakthrough&quot; was the 1937 Board-a-Match Teams championship (now called The Reisinger National Bridge Championship) which he won with three other Philadelphia players: John Crawford, Charles Solomon, and Sally Young.

Goren dominated the competitive bridge circuit ultimately becoming world champion at the Bermuda Bowl in 1950 and remained a competitive player until about 1962 after which he focused on writing and teaching bridge.

==Bridge contributions==
After Milton Work died in 1934, Goren began his own bridge writing career and published the first of his many books on playing bridge, &quot;Winning Bridge Made Easy&quot;, in 1936. Drawing on his experience with Work&#x27;s system, Goren quickly became popular as an instructor and lecturer.

Goren&#x27;s books have sold millions of copies (especially &quot;Winning Bridge Made Easy&quot; and &quot;Contract Bridge Complete&quot;); by 1958 his daily bridge column was appearing in 194 American newspapers. He also had a monthly column in &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; and a weekly column in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

His television program, &quot;Championship Bridge with Charles Goren&quot;, was broadcast from 1959 to 1964 on the ABC network. It featured numerous appearances by top players and segments with celebrity guests such as Chico Marx, Alfred Drake, and Forest Evashevski, among others.

Goren&#x27;s longest partnership was with Helen Sobel, but he also famously partnered actor Omar Sharif. Sharif also wrote introductions to or co-authored several of Goren&#x27;s bridge books, and was also co-author of Goren&#x27;s newspaper column, eventually taking it over in collaboration with Tannah Hirsch.

===Point count system===

As he continued writing, Goren began to develop his point count system, based on the Milton Work point count, as an improvement over the existing system of counting &quot;honor tricks&quot;. Goren, with assistance, formulated a method of combining the Work count, which was based entirely on high cards, and various distributional features. This may well have improved the bidding of intermediate players and beginners almost immediately.

===Four-card suits===

Goren also worked to continue the practice of opening four-card suits, with an occasional three-card club suit when the only four-card suit was a weak . In this, he was following the practice established by Ely Culbertson in the early 1930s. Later on, he continued this practice, resisting the well-known &quot;five-card majors&quot; approach that has become a major feature of modern Standard American bidding.

Opening a four-card suit can improve the chances of the partnership identifying a four-four trump fit, and the four-card approach is still used by experts today, notably by most Acol players. It is claimed that the drawback of the four-card approach is that the Law of Total Tricks is more difficult to apply in cases where it is used. However, the five-card majors approach became popular before the Law of Total Tricks was propounded.

===Other contributions===

In addition to his pioneering work in bringing simple and effective bridge to everyday players, Goren also worked to popularize the Precision bidding method, which is one of many so-called big club or strong club systems (which use an opening bid of one club to indicate a strong hand).

Tribune Content Agency distributes the daily column Goren Bridge, written by Bob Jones, using the Goren method.

==Legacy==

Goren died on April 3, 1991, in Encino, California, at the age of 90. He had lived with his nephew Marvin Goren for 19 years. While few players &quot;play Goren&quot; exactly today, the point-count approach he popularized remains the foundation for most bidding systems.

During the month of Goren&#x27;s death, Truscott followed his obituary with a bridge column entitled, &quot;Goren leaves behind many fans and a column with an international flavor&quot;. His business interests had been &quot;managed by others&quot; since his retirement &quot;a quarter of a century ago&quot;, according to Truscott. &quot;The Goren syndicated column now has an international flavor: It carries the bylines of the movie star Omar Sharif, an Egyptian who lives in Paris, and an entrepreneur, Tannah Hirsch, a South African who came to the United States via Israel.&quot;

Goren appeared on the Groucho Marx radio and television game show You Bet Your Life in March 1958.

Goren appeared on the television game show What’s My Line in December 1961.

<doc id="13095" wikidata="Q1429836" url="?curid=13095" title="Galactus">
<text>Galactus () is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Formerly a mortal man, he is a cosmic entity who consumes planets to sustain his life force, and serves a functional role in the upkeep of the primary Marvel continuity. He was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #48 (March 1966). Lee and Kirby wanted to introduce a character that broke from the archetype of the standard villain. In the character&#x27;s first appearance, Galactus was depicted as a god-like figure that fed by draining living planets of their energy, and operated without regard to the morality or judgments of mortal beings.

Galactus&#x27;s initial origin was that of a Taa-an space explorer named Galan who gained cosmic abilities by passing near a star, but writer Mark Gruenwald further developed the character&#x27;s origins, presenting Taa and Galan as existing in the universe prior to the Big Bang that began the setting of the current universe. As Galan&#x27;s universe came to an end, he merged with the &quot;Sentience of the Universe&quot; to become Galactus, an entity who must consume planets to sustain his existence. Additional material written by John Byrne, Jim Starlin, and Louise Simonson explored Galactus&#x27;s role and purpose in the Marvel Universe, and examined the character&#x27;s actions through themes of genocide, manifest destiny, ethics, and natural/necessary existence. Frequently accompanied by a herald (such as the Silver Surfer), the character has appeared as both antagonist and protagonist in central and supporting roles. Since debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, Galactus has played a role in over five decades of Marvel continuity. In 2009, Galactus ranked fifth on IGN&#x27;s list of &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Villains&quot;, which cited the character&#x27;s &quot;larger-than-life presence&quot; as making him one of the more important villains ever created. IGN also noted &quot;Galactus is one of the few villains on our list to really defy the definition of an evil-doer&quot; as the character is compelled to destroy worlds because of his hunger, rather than out of malicious ends.

The character has been featured in other Marvel media, such as arcade games, video games, animated television series, and the 2007 film &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot;. He will appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;The Fantastic Four: First Steps&quot; (2025), portrayed by Ralph Ineson.

==Publication history==
Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist-coplotter Jack Kirby, the character debuted in &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #48 (March 1966, the first of a three-issue story later known as &quot;The Galactus Trilogy&quot;).

===Origin===

In 1966, nearly five years after launching Marvel Comics&#x27; flagship superhero title, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby collaborated on an antagonist designed to break the supervillain mold of the tyrant with god-like stature and power. As Lee recalled in 1993,

Kirby described his biblical inspirations for Galactus and an accompanying character, an angelic herald Lee called the Silver Surfer:

Kirby elaborated, &quot;Galactus in actuality is a sort of god. He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone&#x27;s opinion. In a way he is kind of a Zeus, who fathered Hercules. He is his own legend, and of course, he and the Silver Surfer are sort of modern legends, and they are designed that way.&quot;

Writer Mike Conroy expanded on Lee and Kirby&#x27;s explanations: &quot;In five short years from the launch of the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, the Lee/Kirby duo ... had introduced a whole host of alien races or their representatives ... there were the Skrulls, the Watcher and the Stranger, all of whom Lee and Kirby used in the foundations of the universe they were constructing, one where all things were possible but only if they did not flout the &#x27;natural laws&#x27; of this cosmology. In the nascent Marvel Universe, characters acted consistently, whatever comic they were appearing in. Their actions reverberated through every title. It was pure soap opera but on a cosmic scale, and Galactus epitomized its epic sweep.&quot;

This led to the introduction of Galactus in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #48–50 (March–May 1966), which fans began calling &quot;The Galactus Trilogy&quot;. Kirby did not intend Galactus to reappear, to preserve the character&#x27;s awe-inspiring presence. Fan popularity, however, prompted Lee to ask Kirby for Galactus&#x27; reappearance, and the character became a mainstay of the Marvel Universe.

===1960s===
To preserve the character&#x27;s mystique, his next two appearances were nonspeaking cameos in &quot;Thor&quot; #134 (November 1966), and &quot;Daredevil&quot; #37 (February 1968), respectively. Numerous requests from fans prompted the character to be featured heavily in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #72–77 (March–August 1968). After a flashback appearance in &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; #1 (August 1968), the character returned to Earth in &quot;Thor&quot; #160–162 (January–March 1969). Galactus&#x27; origin was eventually revealed in &quot;Thor&quot; #168–169 (September–October 1969).

===1970s and 1980s===
The character made appearances in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #120–123 (March–June 1972) and &quot;Thor&quot; #225–228 (July–October 1974). These two storylines introduced two new heralds for Galactus. Galactus also featured in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #172–175 (July–October 1976) and 208–213 (July–December 1979).

Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reunited for the origin of the Silver Surfer and Galactus in the one-shot graphic novel &quot;The Silver Surfer: The Ultimate Cosmic Experience!&quot; in 1978. This Marvel Fireside Book, published by Simon &amp; Schuster, was an out-of-continuity retelling of the origin story without the Fantastic Four.

The full Lee-and-Kirby origin story was reprinted in the one-shot &quot;Super-Villain Classics&quot; #1: &quot;Galactus – The Origin&quot; (May 1983), inked by Vince Colletta and George Klein, lettered by John Morelli and colored by Andy Yanchus. While nearly identical to the previous origin, this story featured supplemental material, edits, and deletions by writer Mark Gruenwald, pencillers John Byrne and Ron Wilson and inker Jack Abel. Rather than traveling into a dying star, the character enters the core of the collapsing universe before the Big Bang; the story was later reprinted as &quot;Origin of Galactus&quot; #1 (February 1996).

The character guest-starred in &quot;Rom&quot; #26–27 (January–February 1982). Galactus featured in two related storylines in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #242–244 (May–July 1982) and later #257 (August 1983), in which writer-artist John Byrne introduced the conceit of Galactus feeling remorse for his actions, and the weight of his genocides. In the issue, Death assures Galactus of his role and purpose as one of shepherd and weeder in guiding the universe to its proper purpose, and Galactus remains resolute. Byrne further elaborated on this concept in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #262 (January 1984), which sparked controversy. At the end of the story, Eternity, an abstract entity in the Marvel Universe, appears to validate the existence of Galactus as necessary for the natural order and essential to prevent an even more catastrophic fate; Howard University professor of literature Marc Singer criticized this, accusing the writer-artist of using the character to &quot;justify planetary-scale genocide.&quot; Byrne and Stan Lee also collaborated on a one-shot Silver Surfer story (June 1982) in which Galactus returned to Zenn-La after the Surfer&#x27;s rebellion and drained it of energy after allowing the populace to flee.

Writer-penciller John Byrne and inker Terry Austin produced &quot;The Last Galactus Story&quot; as a serial in the anthology comic-magazine &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot; #26–34 (October 1984 – February 1986). Nine of a scheduled 10 installments appeared. Each was six pages with the exception of the eighth installment (12 pages). The magazine was cancelled with issue #34, leaving the last chapter unpublished and the story unfinished; however, Byrne later published the conclusion on his website. Galactus played a pivotal role in the limited series &quot;Secret Wars&quot; #1–12 (May 1984 – April 1985), and became a recurring character in &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; (vol. 3) (beginning with issue #1 (July 1987)).

Stan Lee and artist John Buscema also produced the 64-page hardcover graphic novel &quot;Silver Surfer: Judgment Day&quot; (October 1988), in which Galactus clashes with the demonic entity Mephisto.

===1990s===
Galactus was featured in the miniseries &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; #1–6 (July –December 1991), &quot;The Infinity War&quot; #1–6 (June –November 1992) and &quot;Cosmic Powers&quot; #1–6 (March –August 1994). The character starred in the six-issue miniseries &quot;Galactus the Devourer&quot; (September 1999 –March 2000), written by Louise Simonson and illustrated by John Buscema, which climaxed with Galactus&#x27; death. Simonson originally conceived that the story arc would occur in &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; (vol. 3), but the title was cancelled due to dwindling sales. She proposed a separate limited series, and at the time was initially doubtful that Marvel would approve what she considered a &quot;radical&quot; idea concerning &quot;why the very existence of the universe depends on the health and well-being of Galactus.&quot;

===2000s===
The consequences of Galactus&#x27; death are explored in the issues &quot;Fantastic Four Annual 2001&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (vol. 3) #46–49 (October 2001 – January 2002) written by Jeph Loeb and culminate in Galactus&#x27; revival, bringing resolution to Simonson&#x27;s cliffhanger from the &quot;Devourer&quot; story arc. The character features in the first six issues of the limited series &quot;Thanos&quot; (December 2003 – May 2004), written by Jim Starlin. Issues #7–12 (June–November 2004), written by Keith Giffen, introduce the Fallen One, who is retroactively presented as Galactus&#x27; first herald.

Galactus&#x27; origin is re-examined in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #520–523 (October 2004 – April 2005), in which the character is temporarily reverted to his mortal form. After appearing in the limited series &quot;Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill&quot; #1–6 (March–August 2005) Galactus was a central character in the &quot;Annihilation&quot; storyline, appearing in the limited series &quot;Annihilation: Silver Surfer&quot; #1–4 (June–September 2006), &quot;Annihilation&quot; #1–6 (October 2006 – March 2007) and the epilogue, &quot;Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus&quot; #1–2 (February–April 2007).

Galactus was an antagonist in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #545–546 (June–July 2007), where he tried to devour fellow cosmic function Epoch. In &quot;Nova&quot; (vol. 4) #13–15 (May–July 2008), the character had no dialogue. Author Andy Lanning said that he and co-writer Dan Abnett were &quot;treating Galactus like a force of nature; an inevitable, planetary catastrophe that there is no reasoning with, no bargaining with and no escaping.&quot; Galactus also appeared in the limited series &quot;Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter&quot; #1–3 (June–August 2009), a sequel to &quot;Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill&quot; #1–6.

===2010s===
Galactus and the Silver Surfer appeared as antagonists in both &quot;Skaar: Son of Hulk&quot; #7–12 (March 1, 2009 – August 1, 2009) and &quot;Son of Hulk&quot; #13–17 (September 1, 2009 – January 2010), and as protagonists in the miniseries &quot;The Thanos Imperative&quot; #1–6 (June–November 2010). Galactus was a member of the God Squad in the miniseries &quot;Chaos War&quot; #2–5 (December 2010 – March 2011). After an appearance in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #583–587 (November 2010 – March 2011), the character returned to Earth in &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; (vol. 6) #1–5 (January–May 2011) and was the antagonist in &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; #1–6 (April–September 2011). Galactus played a supporting role in the storyline &quot;Forever&quot; featured in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #600–604 (November 2011 – March 2012) and &quot;FF&quot; #16 (March 2012) by Johnathan Hickman, where Hickman introduced the concept of a shared destiny between Galactus and Franklin Richards. Writer Mark Waid would subsequently develop this concept further (see below).

The character played a central role as antagonist in &quot;Hunger&quot; #1–4 (2013), in which the mainstream Galactus of the primary Marvel continuity merges with his counterpart from the Ultimate Marvel publication imprint, Gah Lak Tus. Writer Joshua Hale Fialkov commented that his intent was to use Galactus as a means to place the characters from the Ultimate Marvel imprint into a completely unexpected crisis: &quot;What I hope comes across is the sense of wonder that&#x27;s being brought into the Ultimate Universe...with the smart, modern tone Brian has established.&quot;

Following his appearance in &quot;Hunger&quot;, Galactus was a major supporting character in &quot;The Ultimates&quot; (vol. 3) #1–6 (January–June 2016), where writer Al Ewing fundamentally changed the nature of Galactus&#x27; character. During the events of the story, Galactus is transformed into &quot;the Lifebringer&quot;, a being who is compelled to infuse dead planets with life-sustaining energies, thus altering the character&#x27;s primary motive for the first time since Galactus&#x27; debut in 1966. Elaborating on what inspired the change, Ewing explained &quot;What inspired it—a mixture of wanting someone big on or allied with the team—originally, we thought about Odin, but he&#x27;s a bit busy—and my usual preoccupations with atonement, redemption, growth and change. So what can [Galactus] do now? Well, whereas before he was taking in vast amounts of energy, now he&#x27;s putting out vast amounts of energy—pure life energy. He always said he was going to give back more than he took out of the universe—now he&#x27;s making good on that, one dead world at a time.&quot; The themes of redemption and change were received well by columnist Mark Peters, who described Ewing&#x27;s work on &quot;Ultimates&quot; as &quot;one of the best Galactus stories ever.&quot;

Galactus featured prominently in a direct sequel series to &quot;The Ultimates&quot; (vol. 3) #1–6 titled &quot;The Ultimates 2&quot; (vol. 2) #1–10 (November 2016 – August 2017) which focused on the Lifebringer Galactus as the de facto leader of the Ultimates. Galactus in his Lifebringer persona made his final appearance in &quot;Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur&quot; #26–30 (December 2017 – April 2018) before being reverted to his &quot;Devourer of Worlds&quot; persona by writer Gerry Dugan in &quot;Infinity Countdown&quot; #4 (June 2018).

Set at the end of the primary Marvel continuity, the miniseries &quot;History of the Marvel Universe&quot; #1–6 (July 2019 – December 2019) by Mark Waid depicted Galactus as the in-story narrator. The story features Galactus recounting all the major events that have occurred in Marvel continuity to Franklin Richards as the universe experiences its final moments. Confirming the series as occurring within the primary Marvel continuity, Waid elaborated that &quot;[t]here is a framing device, yes. We wanted it to be a story, not just a long Wikipedia entry. As established in Jonathan Hickman&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; run, there comes a point when Galactus and Franklin Richards stand together at the end of time, and now we get to see exactly what they were doing there.&quot;

===2020s===
Galactus was killed by Thor during the &quot;Herald of Thunder&quot; story arc in &quot;Thor&quot; (vol. 6) #1–6 (March–August 2020), and reappeared after a two-year hiatus in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (vol. 6) #45 (July 2022)—the final issue of the event &quot;Reckoning War&quot;—where Galactus is resurrected by his former heralds.

==Fictional character biography==
Reality has gone through cycles of creation and destruction. Galactus was originally the Taa-an explorer Galan of the planet Taa in the sixth incarnation of the universe, which existed before the Big Bang of the current universe. When an unknown cosmic cataclysm gradually kills all other life in his universe, Galan and other survivors leave Taa on a spacecraft and are engulfed in the Big Crunch. Galan, however, does not die: after bonding with the Sentience of the Universe, he changes and gestates for billions of years in an egg made of the debris of his ship that the current universe formed after the Big Bang. He emerges as Galactus, and though an unnamed Watcher observed Galactus&#x27;s birth and recognizes his destructive nature, the Watcher chooses not to kill Galactus. Starving for sustenance, Galactus consumes the nearby planet of Archeopia—the first of many planets he would destroy to maintain his existence. Subsequently, in memory of his dead homeworld of Taa and the first planet (Archeopia) to fall prey to his hunger, Galactus constructs a new &quot;homeworld&quot;: the Möbius strip-shaped space station called Taa II.

Galactus becomes involved in a civil war among the &quot;Proemial Gods&quot;, who had come into being during the universe&#x27;s infancy. When a faction of the gods led by Diableri of Chaos attempts to remake the universe in their own image, Galactus kills Diableri and imprisons three others (Antiphon, Tenebrous, and Aegis) in the prison called the Kyln.

Galactus then creates the being Tyrant out of a desire for companionship, but the two ultimately engage in a major conflict. Galactus decides to empower his first herald—the Fallen One—who ultimately rebels against his master. When approaching the planet of Zenn-La, Galactus accepts the offer of Norrin Radd to become his herald, the Silver Surfer, in exchange for sparing his world. Eventually locating Earth, Galactus is driven off by the Fantastic Four, Uatu the Watcher, and the rebellious Silver Surfer after the Human Torch—with the Watcher&#x27;s assistance—retrieves the Ultimate Nullifier from Taa II. Although Galactus leaves Earth, vowing that he will never try to consume it again, he banishes the Surfer to Earth for betraying him. Galactus later returns for his former herald, but the Surfer is unrepentant and chooses to remain on Earth. Thor learns of Galactus&#x27; origin when the entity comes into conflict with Ego the Living Planet.

Returning to Earth, Galactus unsuccessfully tries to re-enlist the Silver Surfer. After the Fantastic Four and the Surfer defeat Galactus&#x27;s new herald, the Air-Walker, Mister Fantastic reprograms Galactus&#x27;s ship to travel to the Negative Zone, which contains many uninhabited worlds that could potentially be consumed. Thor and Olympian ally Hercules encounter Galactus when his next herald, Firelord, travels to Earth to be free of his master. Galactus frees Firelord when Thor presents Galactus with the magical Asgardian suit of armor named the Destroyer to animate and use as a herald.

Galactus comes into conflict with the High Evolutionary when attempting to devour Counter-Earth, but he is temporarily transformed into harmless energy after attempting to devour the planet Poppup, the homeworld of the Impossible Man. After returning to normal form, Galactus is sought by the Fantastic Four to help stop a new cosmic threat, the Sphinx. Mr. Fantastic offers to release Galactus from his vow to not devour Earth if he helps defeat the Sphinx. Galactus agrees, if the Fantastic Four first recruit a being called Tyros as a new herald. The quartet succeed, and the newly empowered and renamed Terrax the Tamer leads his master to Earth. Galactus locates and defeats the Sphinx in Egypt, but is confronted by Mr. Fantastic, who, unbeknownst to Galactus, wields a fake Ultimate Nullifier. Unable to read Richards&#x27; mind (which is protected by the Watcher), Galactus retreats.

Galactus empowers and uses the superheroine Dazzler to locate a missing Terrax, who is in fact hiding from his master inside a black hole. The Dazzler defeats and retrieves Terrax, and forces Galactus to return her to Earth. Galactus is fooled by the Galadorian Spaceknight Rom into trying to devour the Black Nebula, the homeworld of the Dire Wraiths, but he is repelled by the Wraiths&#x27; Dark Sun. A weakened Galactus pursues the rebellious Terrax to Earth and strips him of his power. Near death, Galactus is saved by the Fantastic Four and the Avengers while also acquiring another herald: Nova II, who offers herself as Galactus&#x27; herald in exchange for him sparing Earth again. Galactus devours the Skrulls&#x27; throneworld of Tarnax IV, and discusses his role in the universe with fellow cosmic entity Death. Mr. Fantastic is captured by the Shi&#x27;ar for saving Galactus&#x27; life, and is tried by all of the aliens who survived the annihilation of their homeworlds by Galactus. During the trial, the cosmic entity Eternity — the sentient embodiment of space and reality of the Marvel Universe — intervenes, allowing all beings present to momentarily become one with the universe, allowing them to understand that Galactus is a necessary part of the cosmic order.

During the Secret Wars, Galactus attempts to consume Battleworld to force the Beyonder to remove his hunger, but his plan is foiled by Doctor Doom. Galactus grants clemency to the Silver Surfer, who aids his former master against the Elders of the Universe and the In-Betweener. Galactus also rescues the Surfer and Nova II from Mephisto&#x27;s realm, and aids the cosmic hierarchy in a war against the mad Eternal Thanos, who wields the Infinity Gauntlet.

When Nova II is conscience-stricken at causing the death of billions of aliens, Galactus takes on a new herald, the bloodthirsty Morg the Executioner. Tyrant eventually returns and Morg sacrifices himself to stop the former creation of Galactus by using the Ultimate Nullifier. Galactus then decides, with help from his new herald Red Shift, to only devour the energy of living beings, which brings him into conflict with alien races and Earth&#x27;s superheroes. During a final confrontation near Chandilar, the throneworld of the Shi&#x27;ar, the Silver Surfer turns Galactus&#x27; siphoning machines against him. A starving Galactus dies and assumes the form of a star. The death of Galactus allows the entity Abraxas (a metaphysical embodiment of destruction) to emerge from imprisonment. The entity wreaks havoc across thousands of alternate universes, killing various incarnations of Galactus before the children of Mr. Fantastic — Franklin Richards and Valeria von Doom — exhaust their powers to restore the original Galactus. Galactus then provides Mr. Fantastic with the Ultimate Nullifier, which he uses to reset reality and prevent Abraxas&#x27; initial escape and destruction.

Conscience-stricken, Galactus tries to rid himself of his cosmic hunger by feeding on the power from the Infinity Gems, but is tricked into releasing the Hunger, a being which feeds on entire galaxies. The Hunger is destroyed when Thanos orchestrates a final battle with Galactus. When an alien race develops a technology to make planets invisible to Galactus, he empowers the Human Torch (who has traded powers with his sister the Invisible Woman and becomes the Invisible Boy as a result of this) and utilizes the hero as an unwilling herald to locate the planets. The Fantastic Four and Quasar free the Torch by changing Galactus back into the humanoid Galan, who chooses to exile himself to an energy-rich alternate dimension before he can transform back into Galactus so that he can feed on that reality without endangering planets.

Galactus consumes Beta Ray Bill&#x27;s Korbinite homeworld with the help of his new herald, Stardust. After Annihilus declares war on the universe, the entity attacks and destroys the Kyln, freeing former Galactus foes Tenebrous and Aegis. Sensing their release, Galactus temporarily releases Stardust from his service and re-employs the Silver Surfer as his herald due to his familiarity with their old foes. Tenebrous and Aegis, however, find and defeat the Surfer and Galactus and deliver them to Annihilus. Annihilus intends to use Galactus as a weapon to destroy all life in the universe, but is thwarted when the entity is freed by Drax the Destroyer. Galactus retaliates and destroys most of Annihilus&#x27; forces. Seeking a final confrontation with Tenebrous and Aegis, Galactus sends the Silver Surfer to locate them. The Surfer eventually draws the pair into the barrier between the universe and the Negative Zone, which destroys both of them.

After an encounter with Epoch, Galactus consumes the planet Orbucen. When a distraught Beta Ray Bill seeks vengeance for the destruction of the Korbinites&#x27; homeworld, Galactus relents and creates a female Korbinite as a companion for Bill. Galactus also consumes the planet Sakaar, earning the enmity of the Hulk&#x27;s alien-born twin sons, Skaar and Hiro-Kala.

The Silver Surfer finds the body of a future Galactus underneath New York City, and he summons the present Galactus to Earth. Mr. Fantastic explains that, in the distant future, the heroes on a dying Earth had killed Galactus and then escaped to the present via time travel. When Galactus discovers these heroes now live on a planet called Nu-Earth, he destroys it and its inhabitants in retribution.

A tear in the fabric of space caused by the Annihilation Wave and other interstellar conflicts allows the extra-universal forces of the Cancerverse (an alternate universe without death) to invade. Galactus, the Celestials and the resurrected Tenebrous and Aegis combat the powerful Cancerverse weapon: the Galactus Engine (constructed from the corpse of the Cancerverse&#x27;s counterpart to Galactus). During the events of the Chaos War, Galactus is teleported to Earth by the Olympian demigod Hercules to help fight the Chaos King, a metaphysical embodiment of Oblivion and another antithesis of Eternity. While the Hulk and his allies the God Squad, Alpha Flight, and several members of the Avengers fight Amatsu-Mikaboshi&#x27;s forces, Amadeus Cho and Galactus develop a machine which will move Earth to a safe location in a sealed-off continuum, only to adapt the plan by trapping Amatsu-Mikaboshi in that dimension instead.

After an encounter with the High Evolutionary, Galactus invades Asgard, home of the Norse Gods, seeking an Asgardian artifact to sate his hunger and spare future civilizations. Odin, ruler of the Norse Gods, contends that Galactus wishes to ensure that he is not replaced in the next universe. To avoid a protracted battle, the Silver Surfer offers to remain on Earth to guard the artifact on the condition that Galactus may have it once Asgard eventually passes. Galactus recruits a human preacher from Earth named Pastor Mike (full name unknown) that he names Praeter to be his new herald. Later, when the Mad Celestials from Earth-4280 invade, Galactus destroys one before being struck down by the others. Revived by Franklin Richards, he and Franklin succeed in vanquishing the remaining Celestials, and prevent the destruction of Earth. In the aftermath, Galactus learns that he will no longer face the eventual end of the universe alone; he and Franklin will witness it together.

Galactus is then pulled through a hole in space-time to an alternate universe and meets another version of himself: a space-faring mechanical hive mind called &quot;Gah Lak Tus&quot;. After the two merge with one another, Galactus makes his way towards this universe&#x27;s Earth in an attempt to consume it. The heroes of the alternate Earth travel to Earth-616 to acquire information on Galactus and eventually manage to send Galactus to the Negative Zone, reasoning that he will eventually starve to death, as the region is composed of anti-matter. A comatose Galactus is found by the Eternals and Aarkus, who hope to use him in their war against the Kree.

Galactus returns to the universe, and after an encounter with Squirrel Girl, is forced into his own incubator by the Ultimates, who are determined to end his threat. Galactus re-emerges as a Lifebringer instead of a Devourer of Worlds, his first act as such being to re-create Archeopia, the first planet that he ever consumed. Galactus later rescues the team at the behest of Eternity, and learns that the latter has been imprisoned by an unknown force. Galactus also comes into conflict with fellow cosmic entities Master Order and Lord Chaos, who, along with the Molecule Man, wish for Galactus to return to his former role as a Devourer of Worlds and thereby restore the cosmic order. Galactus locates the hero Anti-Man outside the Multiverse and, after transforming him into a Herald of Life, sends him to recruit the recently disbanded Ultimates to help discover the identity of Eternity&#x27;s captor, who is later revealed to be the First Firmament, the first iteration of the cosmos. Master Order and Lord Chaos bring Galactus to trial before the Living Tribunal, still seeking to restore Galactus to his former state for the sake of the cosmic order. Although Galactus successfully argues that the balance of the new Multiverse is different and that his old role is obsolete, the Tribunal is destroyed by a Firmament-influenced Master Order and Lord Chaos. After a brief battle, Master Order decides to create a new cosmic order, which it and Lord Chaos would control. Their former servant, the In-Betweener, is forcibly merged with them into a new cosmic being called Logos. After destroying several Celestials, Logos forcibly transforms Galactus back into the Devourer of Worlds. The process is reversed when Anti-Man sacrifices his life to restore Galactus as the Lifebringer. Galactus then swears to free the imprisoned Eternity.

During the &quot;Infinity Countdown&quot; storyline, the Silver Surfer requests Galactus&#x27; aid in defeating Ultron/Hank Pym by consuming the planet Saiph, which is overrun by Ultron drones. Galactus reluctantly agrees. After consuming Saiph, Galactus&#x27; hunger returns and the Silver Surfer becomes his herald again as he takes Galactus to find an uninhabited planet.

Returning to Earth, Galactus has a confrontation with Doctor Doom and the Fantastic Four, with Doom revealing his plans to harness Galactus&#x27; power as an energy source. Banished to the mystical realms by an alien sorcerer, Galactus becomes entangled in the schemes of Dormammu and Mephisto. Galactus begins to consume mystical energy, eventually absorbing Dormammu and other mystical entities, and in doing so goes insane and destabilizes reality. Doctor Strange intervenes and – with the aid of Eternity and the Living Tribunal – is able to undo the damage wrought by Galactus.

An injured Galactus crashlands on Asgard, apparently seeking asylum from the cause of his universe&#x27;s destruction: the Black Winter (Fimbulwinter), a cosmic entity that fulfills a similar purpose to Galactus on a far larger scale — rather than simply devouring planets, it consumes entire universes. Galactus reveals to All-Father Thor that he had a vision of Thor being responsible for his death. In a bid to destroy the Black Winter, Galactus turns Thor into his Herald of Thunder. Thor later learns that the Black Winter considers Galactus to be &quot;his&quot; herald. This causes an angered Thor to drain Galactus of his energies enough to turn him into a desiccated husk. When the Black Winter moves in to claim Galactus&#x27; body, Thor uses it as a bomb to decimate the Black Winter.

==Powers and abilities==
Galactus was created during the union of the Sentience of the (previous) Universe and Galan of Taa, and is described as &quot;the physical, metamorphosed embodiment of a cosmos.&quot; Although he is not an abstract, non-corporeal entity, his true form cannot be perceived by most beings; each species sees Galactus in a form they can comprehend, similar to their race or a deity of their religion. Galactus can also appear as a humanoid star when addressing fellow members of the cosmic hierarchy. Through his actions of consuming planets, Galactus serves as a cosmic test of survival for civilizations. Additionally, the continued existence of Galactus ensures the confinement of the cosmic entity Abraxas. As Galactus requires planets with the potential to support life, his existence also causes the extinction of entire extraterrestrial civilizations.
The consumption of planets is what maintains Galactus&#x27; life and power. He usually employs the Elemental Converter, which converts matter into energy more efficiently, even though he is capable of feeding without it. Alternatively, Galactus can absorb energy directly from cosmic beings and even mystical entities—though with unpredictable results. Processing this cosmic energy allows Galactus to utilize a force known as the Power Cosmic to perform great feats, which have included universal cosmic awareness, telepathy, telekinesis, energy projection; size alteration; transmutation of matter; teleportation of objects across space, the creation of force fields and interdimensional portals; the creation of life, the resurrection of the dead, manipulating souls, memories and emotions, and mass-scale events such as recreating dead worlds in every detail (including illusions of their entire populations) and destroying multiple solar systems simultaneously.

To aid in his search for suitable planets, Galactus frequently appoints an individual as his herald, granting each one in turn a small fraction of the Power Cosmic. This power replaces the auras (or souls) of the recipient, with each wielder&#x27;s physical form adapting to store the energy and in turn allow manipulation for feats such as energy projection. Galactus is also capable of removing the Power Cosmic from the herald. Galactus has on occasion been severely weakened due to a lack of sustenance, and on one occasion was defeated while in this state by the combined efforts of both the Fantastic Four and the Avengers. In this weakened condition, Galactus has also shown susceptibility to Ikonn&#x27;s spell, which forces him to remember all of the beings that he has killed due to his feeding.

Galactus also possesses scientific knowledge that is beyond comprehension as the oldest living entity in the universe. He is capable of building massive starships of his own design, humanoid robots called Punishers used to battle foes beneath his attention, the Ultimate Nullifier (a superweapon capable of destroying and remaking the Multiverse), and the solar system-sized and Möbius strip-shaped space station named Taa II. Mr. Fantastic has speculated that Taa II may be the greatest source of energy in the universe.

The final issue of &quot;The Adventures of the X-Men&quot; reveals that the previous universe from which Galan originates was Earth-92131, which was being destroyed when the Dweller-in-Darkness used the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal to feed of the energies of the dying universe. Galan&#x27;s rebirth as Galactus is depicted as being observed by the Living Tribunal and the Brothers from &quot;DC vs. Marvel&quot;.

===Amalgam Comics===
In the Amalgam Comics universe that combines Marvel and DC characters, Galactus is combined with DC&#x27;s Brainiac to create Galactiac, a being that consumes planetary energy but also leaves some of the world intact for his own personal study.

===&quot;Bullet Points&quot;===
In the five-issue miniseries &quot;Bullet Points&quot; (January – May 2007), Galactus arrives on Earth with the Silver Surfer and kills most of Earth&#x27;s heroes. Their sacrifice inspires the Surfer to turn on Galactus, who flees Earth.

In &quot;Earth X&quot;, Galactus is one of the three entities in the universe responsible for keeping cosmic entities the Celestials in check. By destroying planets (the &quot;eggs&quot; of the Celestials), Galactus prevents the beings from overpopulating the universe. Franklin Richards eventually adopts Galactus&#x27; identity.

===&quot;Exiles&quot;===
The series &quot;Exiles&quot; features a version of Galactus that restores rather than destroys worlds, and empowers Sabretooth to defeat a renegade Silver Surfer.

===&quot;Galacta, Daughter of Galactus&quot;===
In an out-of-continuity comic one-shot, &quot;Galacta, Daughter of Galactus&quot;, a &quot;celestial parasite&quot; within Galactus is revealed to have spawned a daughter, &quot;Gali&quot; a.k.a. Galacta, who secretly lives on Earth working as a doctor and superhero while seeking to suppress her &quot;own&quot; hunger. After attempting to use the Ultimate Nullifier to prevent herself from being driven to consume the planet, Galactus replenishes his daughter with cosmic energy and explains her origins to her, leading Gali to realize that she is pregnant.

===&quot;Galactus: Dawn of the Heralds&quot;===
In an alternate universe, to resurrect Galactus, the Silver Surfer used the remnants of Ultron, creating a fusion of Ultron and Galactus.

===&quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;===
In the alternate future of Earth-691, the original Guardians of the Galaxy witness the formation of a symbiotic relationship between Galactus and the former Silver Surfer, now known as the Keeper. Having been named a Protector of the Universe by Eon and further empowered with the Quantum Bands, the Keeper possesses sufficient power to constantly supply Galactus with energy, ending his need to consume worlds.

===&quot;Heroes Reborn&quot;===
&quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (vol. 2) features a pocket universe created by Franklin Richards after the events of &quot;Onslaught&quot;, and includes a version of Galactus with five heralds, each appearing to represent one of the four classical elements according to Greek philosophy: air (Air-Walker), fire (Firelord), water (Plasma) and earth (Terrax). As for the Silver Surfer, he may represent aether or &quot;energy,&quot; a fifth element associated with the other four. Galactus and his Heralds are all worshiped by the Inhumans.

===&quot;King Thor&quot;===
In the timeline of an aged and future King Thor, Galactus comes to a deserted Earth to finally consume it. The entity eventually bonds with All-Black the Necrosword and becomes &quot;Galactus the World Butcher&quot;, devouring multiple planets. Galactus is finally consumed by an All-Black-empowered Ego the Living Planet.

===&quot;Mangaverse&quot;===
Galactus appears as a gigantic, planet-sized life form—complete with a single massive eye and tentacles—covered with a number of life forms (Galactus spores), which aid its digestion.

===&quot;Marvel Adventures Fantastic Four&quot;===
&quot;Marvel Adventures&quot;—aimed at a younger audience—concluded its &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; imprint with issue #48. Set at the end of time, Galactus summons the present-day Fantastic Four to his side to battle the last surviving villains in the universe. The Fantastic Four eventually retreat to Galactus&#x27; ship, unable to defeat the villains, only to witness Galactus dismiss them with a gesture. The comic ends with the Fantastic Four returning to their present-day, realizing that Galactus had summoned them to the end of time out of loneliness, before he continued on as the only living being towards the next iteration of the universe.

===&quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;===
The limited series &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; features the Earth-2149 universe, which is infected by a virus changing sentient beings into flesh-eating zombies. Galactus&#x27; power is absorbed when consumed by the infected Avengers.

===MC2===
The MC2 title &quot;Last Planet Standing&quot; features a future version of Galactus that eventually merges with the Silver Surfer and vows to repair rather than destroy worlds.

===Ultimate Marvel===

The trilogy introduced the threatening entity Gah Lak Tus. First mentioned by the robot Ultimate Vision and subsequently by the Kree, Gah Lak Tus is a group mind of city-sized robotic drones. To prepare for the arrival, the drones send telepathic broadcasts of &quot;fear&quot;, then use envoys (similar to the Silver Surfer), who introduce a flesh-eating virus into planets. Gah Lak Tus is also involved in the &quot;Chitauri-Kree&quot; War, and temporarily merged with Galactus after a temporal rift sends the latter to the Ultimate Marvel universe.

Mahr Vehl stated the Gah Lak Tus swarm was originally built by the ancient Kree eons ago to eliminate all foes and &quot;purify&quot; the universe, but subsequently escaped their control and evolved into its current form.

===&quot;What If Uatu The Watcher Had Never Interfered?&quot;===
During &quot;Reckoning War&quot;, as punishment for his interference Uatu is forced by his father Ikor to watch the unnamed alternate world where he never interfered to warn the Fantastic Four about Galactus&#x27; original attack. Without Uatu&#x27;s aid, Galactus&#x27; attack leaves the Fantastic Four with various injuries, including Sue being blinded and Johnny&#x27;s body burning while Reed is damaged by the radiation in Galactus&#x27; ship, but Reed is able to analyze the energy Galactus feeds on and create a weapon that assaults Galactus with energy on a frequency opposite to the type of energy that sustains him, killing Galactus and providing that alternate Earth with a new form of energy.

==In other media==

*Galactus makes non-speaking appearances in &quot;The Avengers: Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes&quot; episodes &quot;Prisoner of War&quot; and &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot;. This version feeds on antimatter in addition to planetary energy, which he achieves by using life-siphoning machines to convert normal matter into antimatter. Additionally, he was responsible for the destruction of the Skrull&#x27;s home planet Skrullos. After attacking Earth, Galactus is defeated and sent to the Negative Zone, where he can infinitely consume its energy and no longer be a threat.

===Film===
* Galactus appears in &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot;, depicted as a cosmic hurricane-like cloud. Fox apparently wished for the character to remain &quot;discreet&quot;—hence the altered appearance. Visual effects studio Weta Digital convinced Fox to add hints of the character&#x27;s comic-book appearance, including a shadow and a fiery mass inside the cosmic cloud resembling Galactus&#x27; helmet. Director Tim Story said he created Galactus as a cosmic cloud so a future &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; spin-off film would be unique as the character had yet to appear in comic-book form. Film writer J. Michael Straczynski stated &quot;You don&#x27;t want to sort of blow out something that big and massive for one quick shot in the first movie.&quot;

<text>The Game Boy Color (GBC or CGB) is an 8-bit handheld game console, manufactured by Nintendo, which was released in Japan on October 21, 1998, and to international markets that November. Compared to the original Game Boy, the Game Boy Color features a color TFT screen rather than monochrome, a processor that can operate twice as fast, and four times as much memory. It retains backward compatibility with games initially developed for its predecessor.

While the handheld was slightly thicker, taller and had a smaller screen than its immediate predecessor, the Game Boy Pocket, the Color was significantly smaller than the original Game Boy. As with its predecessors, the Game Boy Color has a custom 8-bit processor made by Sharp. The American English spelling of the system&#x27;s name, &quot;Game Boy Color&quot;, remains consistent throughout the world.

While it received positive reviews upon its release, the Game Boy Color was seen as more of a transitional upgrade of the original Game Boy rather than a completely new device. It would have a relatively brief lifespan, being supplanted by the Game Boy Advance after less than three years on the market.

The Game Boy Color is part of the fifth generation of video game consoles. The Game Boy and the Game Boy Color combined have sold 118.69 million units worldwide, making them the fourth best-selling system of all time. Its best-selling games are &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, which shipped 23 million units worldwide.

== History ==
When the original Game Boy was first introduced in 1989, many questioned why Nintendo had chosen to develop a monochrome handheld, considering competitors like the Atari Lynx and Sega Game Gear boasted color screens. However, while these color displays were visually impressive, they led to criticism that the rival devices had poor battery life and were bulky. The Game Boy, in contrast, offered superior portability and longevity, propelling it to immense popularity. Publicly, Nintendo pledged to develop a color Game Boy, but only when technology limitations could be addressed.

Internally, a team led by Satoru Okada, who played a key role in the original Game Boy&#x27;s design, was experimenting with color displays. Their early-1990s prototype, codenamed &quot;Project Atlantis,&quot; featured a color screen and a powerful 32-bit processor from Sharp. However, the team was not satisfied with the outcome and shelved further development.

Despite the lack of color, consumer interest in the Game Boy remained strong. In 1996, Nintendo released the slimmer Game Boy Pocket and the launch of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series that same year further boosted sales. But developers were losing interest in creating new games for the aging platform.

Additional market pressure for Nintendo came in October 1997 when news broke about Bandai&#x27;s new handheld, the WonderSwan. The project was led by Gunpei Yokoi, the engineer who led the development of the Game &amp; Watch series and the original Game Boy. Yokoi had left Nintendo in 1996 following the commercial failure of his final project, the Virtual Boy. His departure caused a stir, with investors dumping Nintendo stock, forcing a temporary halt on trading at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Yokoi was killed in a roadside accident in 1997 before the WonderSwan&#x27;s release.

Faced with mounting pressure, Okada revisited Project Atlantis. Prioritizing speed to market over processing power, he dropped the 32-bit chip for a faster version of the existing Game Boy&#x27;s 8-bit processor that would allow for a quicker launch and maintain compatibility with the existing library of Game Boy games.

The Game Boy Color was announced in March 1998 and released in Japan that October. It received an international rollout throughout November (amid the busy Christmas holiday shopping season), reaching North America on the 18th, Europe on the 23rd, and Australasia on the 27th. Launching at a price of , the Game Boy Color ultimately outsold the WonderSwan, which went on sale in March 1999.

The Game Boy Color had a relatively short lifespan, being on the market for only two and a half years before being succeeded by the Game Boy Advance in 2001. The successor finally brought the 32-bit processing power envisioned in Project Atlantis. Despite the new arrival, the Game Boy Color remained in production, serving as a budget-friendly alternative. The last units were reportedly sold by March 2003.

== Hardware ==
The Game Boy Color uses a custom system on a chip (SoC), integrating the CPU and other major components into a single package, named the CPU CGB by Nintendo and manufactured by the Sharp Corporation. While the CPU CGB was a new design for the Game Boy Color, the technology inside was largely an evolution of the then ten-year-old DMG-CPU SoC used inside the original Game Boy.

Within the CPU CGB, the main processor is a &quot;Sharp SM83&quot;, a hybrid between two other 8-bit processors: the Intel 8080 and the Zilog Z80. The SM83 has the seven 8-bit registers of the 8080 (lacking the alternate registers of the Z80) but uses the Z80&#x27;s programming syntax and extra bit manipulation instructions, along with adding new instructions to optimize the processor for certain operations related to the way the hardware was arranged. The Sharp SM83 also powered the original Game Boy, where it operates at a clock rate of 4.194304 megahertz (MHz). Games on Game Boy Color exclusive cartridges can command the processor to operate in &quot;dual-speed mode,&quot; doubling its frequency to run twice as fast at 8.388608 MHz. This allowed developers to get double the processing power out of the device when creating games exclusively for the Game Boy Color while allowing the hardware to retain backward compatibility with existing games.

The CPU CGB incorporates the &quot;Picture Processing Unit&quot;, a basic GPU that renders visuals using 16 kilobytes (KB) banks of Video RAM, twice as much as the original Game Boy. Games developed specifically for the Game Boy Color could fully utilize this additional memory, enabling enhanced effects and displaying up to 56 colors simultaneously out of a selection of 32,768 colors. Programmers later developed the &quot;high color mode&quot; technique, which involved rapidly switching color palettes to display over 2,000 colors at once. This feature was utilized in games such as &quot;The Fish Files&quot;, &quot;The New Addams Family Series&quot; and &quot;Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare&quot;. When a Game Pak for original Game Boy is inserted, the additional memory is disabled. 

The display itself is a 2.3-inch (diagonal) thin-film transistor (TFT) color liquid-crystal display (LCD), measuring wide by high. The screen aspect ratio and resolution remain identical to the original Game Boy at 160 pixels wide by 144 pixels high in a 10:9 format. Like the original Game Boy and Game Boy Pocket before it and the Game Boy Advance after it, the screen is passively reflective, with a surface behind the screen that sends light back through the liquid crystal pixel elements to the viewer. Because there is no backlight, the device can be hard to use in dark environments.

The SoC contains a 2 KB &quot;bootstrap&quot; ROM which is used to start up the device, 127 B of High RAM that can be accessed faster (similar to a CPU cache), and the &quot;Audio Processing Unit&quot;, a programmable sound generator with four channels: a pulse wave generation channel with frequency and volume variation, a second pulse wave generation channel with only volume variation, a wave channel than can reproduce any waveform recorded in RAM, and a white noise channel with volume variation. The motherboard of the Game Boy Color contains a 32 KB &quot;work&quot; RAM chip, four times more than the original Game Boy.

The Game Boy features a D-pad (directional pad), four action buttons labeled &#x27;A,&#x27; &#x27;B,&#x27; &#x27;SELECT,&#x27; and &#x27;START,&#x27; and a sliding on-off switch on the right side of the device. The volume is adjusted by a potentiometer dial on the left side of the device. 

The left side offers a Game Link Cable port for connecting to up to four Game Boy devices for multiplayer games or, notably in &quot;Pokémon&quot; series games, trading and battling. This port can be used with a Game Boy Printer. The port used on the Game Boy Color is of a smaller design first introduced on the Game Boy Pocket, and requires an adapter to link with the original Game Boy. The Game Boy Color also offered a &quot;high-speed&quot; mode that could operate up 64 times faster than the original Game Boy. The Game Boy Color added an infrared communications port for wireless data transfer, which was supported by a small number of games; the infrared port was not included on the later Game Boy Advance line.

=== Technical specifications ===
=== Cartridges ===
Games are stored on cartridges called Game Boy Game Paks, using read-only memory (ROM) chips. Due to the limitations of the 8-bit architecture of the device, the maximum ROM size the processor could access was 32 KB. Nintendo overcame this limitation with a &quot;Memory Bank Controller&quot; (MBC) in the cartridge. This chip sits between the processor and the ROM and can switch between banks of 32 KB ROM. Using this technology, Nintendo created Game Boy Color games that use up to 8 megabytes in size. Game Paks can provide additional functionality to the Game Boy system. Some cartridges include up to 128 KB of RAM to increase performance, which can be battery-backed to save progress when the handheld is off, real-time clock chips can keep track of time even when the device is off, and Rumble Pak cartridges add vibration feedback to enhance gameplay.

The Game Boy Color has backward compatibility with all original Game Boy games. Three main Game Pak cartridge types for the handheld were released:

Original Game Boy Game Pak (Gray Case): The classic Game Boy cartridges. The Game Boy Color applies a limited color palette (often dark green) using four to ten colors to enhance games originally intended to be presented in four shades of gray. The Game Boy Color&#x27;s &quot;bootstrap&quot; ROM was programmed with default color palettes for more than 90 titles, mainly first-party releases and popular games from other publishers. For games without a default, users can choose from 12 different palettes using button combinations. A dedicated palette option replicates the original Game Boy&#x27;s grayscale experience.

Color enhanced Game Boy Game Pak (Black Case): These cartridges can use the full-color capabilities 
of the console (56 colors simultaneously out of a palette of 32,768) while remaining compatible with the original Game Boy where they are presented in four shades of gray. This compatibility comes at the expense of not being able to utilize the handheld&#x27;s increased processing speed and memory.

Game Boy Color Game Pak (Clear Case): Designed specifically for the Game Boy Color, these cartridges feature the full-color range (56 colors simultaneously out of a palette of 32,768) and benefit from the increased processing speed and memory of the Game Boy Color. Because of this reliance on newer hardware, these games are incompatible with the older monochrome Game Boy models.

=== Model colors ===
Nintendo had seen success selling colored variations of the Play It Loud! Game Boy and the Game Boy Pocket, so the company released the Color in several case variations. 

The logo for Game Boy Color spells out the word &quot;COLOR&quot; in the five original colors in which the unit was manufactured: Berry (C), Grape (O), Kiwi (L), Dandelion (O), and Teal (R). Another color released at the same time was &quot;Atomic Purple&quot;, made of a translucent purple plastic. Other colors were sold as limited editions or in specific countries.

== Games ==


Due to its backward compatibility with Game Boy games, the Game Boy Color launched with a large playable library. The system amassed a library of 576 Game Boy Color games over a four-year period. While the majority of the games are Game Boy Color exclusive, approximately 30% of the games released are compatible with the original Game Boy. Most Game Boy Color games released after 1999 are not compatible with the original Game Boy.

&quot;Tetris&quot; for the original Game Boy is the best-selling game compatible with Game Boy Color, and &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; are the best-selling games developed primarily for it. The best-selling Game Boy Color exclusive game is &quot;Pokémon Crystal&quot;.

The last Game Boy Color game ever released is the Japanese exclusive &quot;Doraemon no Study Boy: Kanji Yomikaki Master&quot;, on July 18, 2003. The last game released in North America is &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, released on November 15, 2002. In Europe, the last game released for the system is &quot;&quot;, on January 10, 2003.

Beyond officially released games for the platform, there is an active online community creating new games for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color through the use of tools like GB Studio. One such example is Dragonhym (originally Dragonborne) which was available for release on a physical cartridge which will be playable on the Game Boy Color.

== Reception ==
=== Sales ===
The Game Boy and Game Boy Color were both commercially successful, selling 118.69 million units worldwide: 32.47 million in Japan, 44.06 million in the Americas, and 42.16 million in all other regions. At the time of its discontinuation in 2003, the combined sales of all Game Boy variants made it the best-selling game console of all time. In later years, its sales were surpassed by the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2 and Nintendo Switch, making it the fourth-best-selling console the second-best-selling handheld of all time, . Sales of the device were in part driven by the success of &quot;Pokémon Gold and Silver&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Crystal&quot;, with combined sales of 29.5 million units, making them one of the best selling-video games of all time.

Sales of the Game Boy Color were strong at launch. Nintendo of America reported a sale of one million units from launch to December 1998, and two million by July 1999. Retail chains in the United States reported unexpectedly high demand for the console, with executives of FuncoLand reporting &quot;very pleasant and unpredicted&quot; sales and Electronics Boutique stating &quot;the entire Game Boy Color line just exploded, including accessories&quot; upon release. Faced with high worldwide demand and competitive retail pricing, retailers such as CompUSA sold out of Game Boy Color stock in the weeks before the 1998 Christmas season.

=== Critical reception ===
Reception of the Game Boy Color was positive, with critics praising the addition of color and improved clarity of the display. 

Affiliated publications such as &quot;Total Games&quot; praised the handheld for its &quot;bright, colorful picture that can be viewed in direct light&quot;, backward compatibility features preserving the &quot;vast catalogue of original Game Boy games&quot;, and improved technical performance. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; praised the Game Boy Color for making the Game Boy library of games &quot;look better than ever – everything is crystal clear, bright and in [color]&quot;. Writing for &quot;GameSpot&quot;, Chris Johnston stated that the display was &quot;crystal clear&quot; and free of motion blur, stating that &quot;Tetris DX&quot; was the &quot;killer app&quot; of the launch titles on the platform. 

Milder reviews included those by &quot;Arcade&quot;, who said that while that the colors were &quot;very impressive&quot; they were &quot;not as eyeball-popping as you might have hoped for [...] it&#x27;s mostly seaweed greens, rusty browns, timid yellows and the like&quot;. They concluded that &quot;nothing about [the Game Boy Color] is very radical&quot; but said the device was &quot;Game Boy as it always should have been&quot;. Reviewers pointed out other drawbacks including that the system was still using an 8-bit architecture when competitors had moved onto 16-bit handheld systems and that the non-backlit screen required that the user be in a well lit area.

=== Legacy ===
Commentary on the legacy of the Game Boy Color has been shaped by the perception that the handheld was as an incremental and transitional upgrade of the Game Boy rather than a completely new device, and had a relatively brief lifespan, being supplanted by the Game Boy Advance after two years, five months on the market.

In a history of Nintendo, author Jeff Ryan noted the Game Boy Color had a reputation as a &quot;legacy machine&quot; that found success mostly due to its backward compatibility, as &quot;few wanted to lose all the &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; and &quot;Pokémon&quot; cartridges they had amassed over the years.&quot; Quoted in &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, Blitz Games Studios developer Bob Pape acknowledged that although &quot;backwards compatibility more or less defined (the) Game Boy Color&quot;, the handheld &quot;ticked all the right boxes with regards to size, battery life, reliability and most importantly backwards compatibility&quot;.

Positive assessments of the legacy of the Game Boy Color have focused on the merits of its game library, particularly for its third-party and import titles. Travis Fahs for &quot;IGN&quot; noted while &quot;the Game Boy Color&#x27;s life was relatively brief&quot;, it &quot;built up a small library of excellent games&quot;, including &quot;Wario Land 3&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Gold and Silver&quot;, and a &quot;unique&quot; and &quot;previously unheard of&quot; line of successful third-party games, including &quot;Dragon Warrior Monsters&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; and &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Dark Duel Stories&quot;. Ashley Day of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; noted that the handheld had an &quot;overlooked&quot; status, stating &quot;the Game Boy Color (has) an unfair reputation as the one Nintendo handheld with few worthwhile titles, but this simply isn&#x27;t the case...returning to the Game Boy Color now reveals a wealth of great games that you never knew existed, especially those available on import.&quot;

<doc id="13098" wikidata="Q898025" url="?curid=13098" title="Genosha">
<text>Genosha ( ) is a fictional country appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. It is an island nation that exists in the Marvel Universe and a prominent location in the X-Men comics. The fictional nation served as an allegory for slavery and later for South African apartheid before becoming a mutant homeland and subsequently a disaster zone. The island is located off the southeastern African coast southwest from Seychelles and northeast of Madagascar. Its capital city was Hammer Bay.

==Publication history==
Genosha, a significant location in the Marvel Universe, first appeared in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #235 in 1988. The island nation was created by Rick Leonardi and Chris Claremont, who used it as an allegory for apartheid-era South Africa, portraying a society where mutants were subjugated and transformed into mindless &quot;mutates&quot; by a brutal regime led by the Genegineer, David Moreau. This portrayal of Genosha highlighted issues of oppression and exploitation, resonating with themes of racial and social injustice.

Initially depicted as a paradise with a dark underbelly, Genosha was ruled by a government that treated mutants as second-class citizens, exploiting them as slave labor. The nation&#x27;s early stories drew parallels to real-world issues of apartheid, reflecting Claremont&#x27;s intention to use the X-Men comics as a platform for exploring complex social and political issues. The island&#x27;s story evolved dramatically over time. In &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #255 (1989), the depiction of Genosha expanded to show the nation descending into civil war, with mutants and &quot;normal&quot; humans locked in a violent conflict, reminiscent of the ethnic conflicts in Bosnia during the 1990s. This civil war storyline deepened Genosha&#x27;s role in the X-Men mythos as a symbol of the broader struggles faced by mutants.

Magneto, the X-Men&#x27;s long-time adversary, was later granted control of Genosha by the United Nations in an attempt to deter him from further aggression against humanity. Under Magneto&#x27;s rule, the island became a sanctuary for mutants, but this was short-lived. In &quot;New X-Men&quot; #115 (2001), Cassandra Nova, the evil twin of Charles Xavier, unleashed a devastating Sentinel attack on Genosha, wiping out most of its population.

==Fictional country history==

===Mutant apartheid===
The island is located off the east coast of Africa, to the north of Madagascar, and boasted a high standard of living, an excellent economy, and freedom from the political and racial turmoil that characterized neighboring nations. However, Genosha&#x27;s prosperity was built upon the enslavement of its mutant population. Mutants in Genosha were the property of the state and children who were positively identified with the mutant gene were put through a process developed by David Moreau, commonly known as the Genegineer, stripped of free will and made into &quot;mutates&quot; (a Marvel term for genetically modified individuals, as opposed to those who developed mutant powers naturally). The Genegineer was also capable of modifying certain mutant abilities in order to fulfill specific labor shortages. Citizenship in Genosha is permanent and the government does not recognize any emigration. Citizens who attempt to leave the country are tracked down and forcibly brought back to the island by the special force known as Press Gang. The Press Gang consisted of Hawkshaw, Pipeline, and Punchout, and were aided in their task by Wipeout. Mutant problems are handled by a special group known as the Magistrates. The foundations of Genoshan society have been upset in recent years due to the efforts of outside mutant interests. In the first storyline to feature the nation, some members of the X-Men (Wolverine, Rogue, and their ally Madelyne Pryor) were kidnapped by Genoshan Magistrates, under the order of the Genegineer. Later, in the multi-issue, multi-title &quot;X-Tinction Agenda&quot; storyline, the X-Men and their allies rescued their teammates, Storm, Meltdown, Rictor and Wolfsbane, from Genoshan brainwashing, toppling the government after discovering their alliance with former X-Factor ally turned mutant hater, Cameron Hodge, and that Havok was one of the Magistrates since having his memory wiped by the Siege Perilous. Havok himself, woken from his conditioning by his brother Cyclops, dealt the killing blow to Cameron Hodge in the process.

===Conflict and Magneto&#x27;s reign===
A new Genoshan regime that promised better treatment of mutants was put in place after Hodge&#x27;s destruction. A period of general turmoil and a number of attacks by superhumans, including Magneto&#x27;s Acolytes who were unwilling to forgive the former Genoshan government for its crimes against mutants, followed.(X-Men vol. 2 #1 1991)

A different version of X-Factor, including Wolfsbane, later returned to the island to help restore peace between its government and a rogue group of super-powered beings that had fled the island. The Genoshan government was shown with peaceful intentions, even trying to undo the ill effects visited upon Wolfsbane. Genosha was also shown to have typical suburban tract housing, like many small towns in America, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

After the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; story arc, it was revealed and retconned that the mutate process formula was given to the Genegineer by Sugar Man, a refugee of the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; timeline.

The United Nations ceded the island nation to the powerful mutant Magneto, after he demanded an entire mutants-only nation. Magneto and his Acolytes managed to reestablish a modicum of peace and stability only briefly until civil war broke out between him and the remaining human population on the island led by the Magistrates. Magneto eventually defeated the Magistrates and restored order to most of the island, with hold-outs briefly remaining at Carrion Cove before being obliterated.

The elimination of the Legacy Virus gave Magneto a freshly healthy army, leading him to declare a campaign of global conquest. A small team of X-Men stopped this plan, badly injuring Magneto in the process (the original issue presented him as being killed, but this was retconned in the &quot;New X-Men&quot; comic book series).

Genosha had a population of sixteen million mutants and a stable, advanced society. However, the entire island was reduced to rubble and its mutant population was slain by Cassandra Nova&#x27;s Wild Sentinels. There were few survivors, many evacuated, and the Brotherhood of Mutants turned one of the Sentinels into a memorial statue.

===Xavier&#x27;s leadership===
Magneto and Xavier have since then joined forces to rebuild the island nation as detailed in the series &quot;Excalibur&quot; vol. 3 (2004). This goes badly as foreign military forces have thrown up a cordon around the island; no one is allowed to enter, and those trying to leave are fired upon.

A few survivors and newly arriving mutants who wish to help with the rebuilding process remain on the island. Members of this volunteer &#x27;army&#x27; include Callisto, Freakshow and Wicked. More are found in the surrounding countryside, some join with Xavier. There is a conflict with Magistrates, the island&#x27;s former law enforcement. Though they are assisted by humanoid creatures they refer to as &#x27;trolls&#x27;, the Magistrates&#x27; forces are driven off. Some of the Magistrates are captured and kept in the island&#x27;s makeshift jail.

Some of the captured Magistrates agree to work with Xavier to rebuild the island. Throughout the entire series, Unus the Untouchable and his squadron of mutants remain a problem; they do not wish to be part of Xavier&#x27;s group.

===House of M===

Later, Magneto learned of his daughter the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s nervous break-down and her ever-growing powers to alter reality. Magneto snatched Wanda from her battle with her fellow Avengers and brought her to Genosha, where he asked Xavier to restore the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s sanity - but to no avail. The telepath couldn&#x27;t help her and, concerned of the threat to reality that Wanda posed, Xavier consulted the Avengers and the X-Men about what to do with her. Their decision was rendered moot, though, as by the time they reached Genosha reality altered around the heroes - changing into the world ruled by the &quot;House of M&quot;.

While conventional reality was eventually restored, it came at a high price, as thousands if not millions of Earth&#x27;s mutant population lost their powers or died in the process, leaving only a few hundred mutants alive and powered. Just like most of his new Genoshan allies and enemies, Magneto was among the depowered people, remaining trapped on the island.

===Son of M and the Collective Incident===
In the limited series &quot;Son of M&quot;, there is a battle between some of the remaining mutants and the Inhumans.

In &quot;The New Avengers&quot; #19-20 it was stated that energy cannot be created or destroyed, and the same held true for the energies of the numerous depowered mutants. Eventually, these energies gathered in the form of an unsuspecting energy-absorbing mutant named Michael Pointer. Dubbed &quot;the Collective&quot; by the Avengers, against whom he then fought, the Collective traveled to Genosha and reached out to the startled Magneto. The Collective, controlled by Xorn, attempted to restore Magneto&#x27;s powers and convince him to lead the remaining mutants into taking over the planet. To the Collective&#x27;s surprise, Magneto resisted and allowed the Avengers to separate the energy from his body and send it into the sun. The comatose Magneto is also taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, but the helicopter that was supposed to transport him off Genosha explodes once it lifts off. Magneto&#x27;s body is not found. It has since been revealed that he survived the explosion and remained depowered until the High Evolutionary&#x27;s dangerous experiment returned his magnetic abilities.

===Silent War===

To date Genosha is now completely dead. Already in ruins before, the battle between the Inhumans and the O*N*E further destroyed the once-proud island nation during the Silent War.

Since Magneto was the last person on Genosha, it seems that it&#x27;s now totally uninhabited, which is corroborated by Wiccan and Speed when they began their search for their mother, the Scarlet Witch. They encountered Genosha an empty land filled with destroyed towers and empty streets.

===Necrosha and beyond===

Selene is seen traveling to the ruined island of Genosha with her followers who were resurrected by the Technarch transmode virus, led there by Blink and Caliban, who tells Selene he senses millions of dead mutants. They enter the ruins and Selene proclaims Hammer Bay, the devastated capital of the island nation Necrosha, the place where she will become a god.

With Eli Bard, Selene resurrects the massacred residents of Genosha, with Cerebro and Bastion&#x27;s computers detecting the rise of mutant numbers into the millions. A problem presents itself in that many of the newly resurrected mutants have been de-powered, despite having been killed &quot;before&quot; M-Day. Wither and Mortis explain what happened and the Coven begins to set up base at Necrosha.

Selene is eventually defeated and killed, thus ending the effect of the corrupted Techno-organic virus in the bodies she revived and returning Genosha to an empty land. According to writer Chris Yost, Elixir is still on Necrosha.

During a visit to Genosha by the students of Jean Grey&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters&#x27; students organized by Beast and Kitty Pryde, Sabretooth and AOA Blob assaulted Kid Gladiator and Kid Omega in order to kidnap Genesis. During this time, there were no mentioning of Elixir living here.

During the &quot;AXIS&quot; storyline, Magneto enters the island of Genosha to find that it had turned into a concentration camp for mutants. He frees two mutant girls who tell him that Red Skull is responsible and possesses Professor X&#x27;s brain. Magneto attacks Red Skull, but is quickly stopped by the Skull&#x27;s S-Men. Magneto is captured and telepathically tortured by Red Skull. He is given visions of those closest to him suffering while being unable to do anything to stop it. After being freed by Scarlet Witch, Rogue, and Havok, he bites down on a vial beneath his skin of Mutant Growth Hormone, giving himself enough power to fight. Havok, Rogue, and Scarlet Witch are captured by the Red Skull&#x27;s S-Men and sent to his concentration camp in Genosha. Rogue (who still has Wonder Man inside her) is able to break the group free. They discover Magneto has been captured, and free him, as well. The three want to leave the island and alert the rest of the Avengers and X-Men of what Red Skull is doing, but Magneto says he&#x27;s going to stay and fight. Before they can do anything, Red Skull appears. Magneto, Rogue, and the Scarlet Witch fought Red Onslaught in Genosha and are later joined by the Avengers and the X-Men. Iron Man used a telepathic tamperer to stop the Red Skull&#x27;s influence. When more heroes arrived to help, Red Onslaught revealed that he influenced Stark to create a model of Sentinels, based on the knowledge of different super heroes he acquired after the Civil War before erasing the latter&#x27;s memories of constructing them. Red Onslaught then deployed his Stark Sentinels to fight the heroes.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;, Magneto and his Uncanny X-Men use Genosha as a staging ground for an ambush on the Dark Riders, who have been targeting mutants with healing powers. After defeating the Dark Riders, Magneto then ties up the Dark Riders and sets off a bomb that kills them and also levels the entire island. It was a sign that Magneto has &quot;no intention of &#x27;Laying Low&#x27;.&quot;

===Empyre===
During the &quot;Empyre&quot; storyline, some of the Cotati used Genosha as a front for their upcoming invasion of Wakanda. This was foiled because of the X-Men, Hordeculture, and the Genoshan zombies that are the results of Scarlet Witch trying to revive the mutants that were killed there.

==Other versions==
* A prison inspired by Guantánamo Bay called &quot;Genosha Bay&quot; appears in the &quot;Marvel Noir&quot; story &quot;X-Men Noir: Mark of Cain&quot; #1. Originally founded by Quaker missionaries who sought to isolate their prisoners from each other so they could contemplate their sins, Genosha Bay would eventually become an extraterritorial United States prison infamous for holding notorious international prisoners and employing inhumane punishments, such as sleep deprivation and water torture. By the 1930s, the U.S. government secretly began recruiting prisoners to serve as government operatives while using the cover of a public judiciary meeting meant to close it being held up by lawmakers unwilling to release its most dangerous prisoners to obscure their true intentions.
* An alternate universe iteration of Genosha appears in stories set in the &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; imprint. This version of the island is located south of Madagascar near Krakoa and controlled by Mojo Adams. Additionally, its primary export is television programs such as &quot;Hunt for Justice&quot; while mutants are treated as second-class citizens after Longshot murdered government minister Lord Joseph Scheele.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Genosha appears in &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot; as the creation of Bolivar Trask, Cameron Hodge, Henry Peter Gyrich, and a government official known as &quot;the Leader&quot;, who advertise the island as a mutant paradise so they can capture mutants, outfit them with power-negating collars, and use them as slave labor to build Sentinels. Eventually, Cable, the X-Men, Magneto, and his Acolytes free the slaves, who are subsequently relocated to Asteroid M, and destroy the Sentinels.
* Genosha appears in &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot;. This version of the island is ruled over by Magneto, who received it from Senator Robert Kelly, and is open to all mutants. While he promises sanctuary, Magneto secretly and unfairly imprisons dissenters and rule breakers. In the three-part series finale &quot;Foresight&quot;, Magneto tasks Mystique with disguising herself as Kelly and ordering a Sentinel attack on Genosha to instigate a human-mutant war, only to face complications from the Phoenix Force. After Emma Frost sends it back into space, Magneto&#x27;s followers lose faith in him and banish him from Genosha. In a possible future depicted in the episode &quot;Badlands&quot;, Genosha was destroyed by the Phoenix Force, with Polaris as the sole survivor.
* Genosha appears in &quot;X-Men &#x27;97&quot;. In the episodes &quot;Mutant Liberation Begins&quot; and &quot;Remember It&quot;, the United Nations discuss integrating Genosha before eventually doing so. Additionally, as of the latter episode, Madelyne Pryor, Banshee, Moira MacTaggert, Callisto, Emma Frost, Sebastian Shaw, and Nightcrawler have become the country&#x27;s ruling council before Genosha is destroyed by Wild Sentinels sent by Bastion.

===Film===
* Genosha appears in &quot;X-Men&quot; (2000) as an uncharted island where Magneto and his Brotherhood have established a base for themselves.
* Genosha appears in &quot;Dark Phoenix&quot; as a mutant refuge run by Magneto, which he received from the U.S. government.

<text>Grinnell College ( ) is a private liberal arts college in Grinnell, Iowa, United States. It was founded in 1846 when a group of New England Congregationalists established Iowa College. It has an open curriculum, which means students need not follow a prescribed list of classes. The college&#x27;s 120-acre campus includes several listings on the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==

In 1843, eleven Congregational ministers, all of whom trained at Andover Theological Seminary in Massachusetts, set out to preach on the frontier. The group also sought to establish a college, which followed in 1846, when they collectively established Iowa College in Davenport.

The first 25 years of Grinnell&#x27;s history saw a change in name and location. In Davenport, the college had advocated against slavery and saloons, leading to conflict with the Davenport city council, which retaliated by constructing roads that transected the campus. Iowa College moved farther west from Davenport to the town of Grinnell and unofficially adopted the name of its new home, which itself had been named for the abolitionist minister Josiah Bushnell Grinnell. The name of the corporation, &quot;The Trustees of Iowa College&quot;, remained, but in 1909 the name &quot;Grinnell&quot; was adopted by the trustees for the institution.

In its early years, the college experienced setbacks. Although two students received Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1854 (the first to be granted by a college west of the Mississippi River), within 10 years the Civil War had claimed most of Grinnell&#x27;s students and professors. In the decade following the war, growth resumed: women were officially admitted as candidates for degrees, and the curriculum was enlarged to include then-new areas of academic studies, such as natural sciences with laboratory work.

In 1882, Grinnell College was struck by a tornado—then called a cyclone, after which the college yearbook was named. The storm devastated the campus and destroyed both college buildings. Rebuilding began immediately, and the determination to expand was not limited to architecture: the curriculum was again extended to include departments in political science (one of the first in the United States—the University of Minnesota&#x27;s department was founded in 1879, three years earlier) and modern languages.

Grinnell became known as the center of the Social Gospel reform movement, as Robert Handy writes, &quot;The movement centered on the campus of Iowa (now Grinnell) College. Its leading figures were Professor George D. Herron and President George A. Gates&quot;. Other firsts pointed to the lighter side of college life: the first intercollegiate football and baseball games west of the Mississippi were played in Grinnell, and the home teams won.

As the 20th century began, Grinnell established a Phi Beta Kappa chapter, introduced the departmental &quot;major&quot; system of study, began Grinnell-in-China (an educational mission that lasted until the Japanese invasion and resumed in 1987), and built a women&#x27;s residence hall system that became a national model. The social consciousness fostered at Grinnell during these years became evident during Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency, when Grinnell graduates Harry Hopkins &#x27;12, Chester Davis &#x27;11, Paul Appleby &#x27;13, Hallie Flanagan &#x27;11, and Florence Kerr &#x27;12 became influential New Deal administrators. Concern with social issues, educational innovation, and individual expression continue to shape Grinnell. As an example, the school&#x27;s &quot;5th year travel-service program&quot;, preceded the establishment of the Peace Corps by many years. Other recent innovations include first-year tutorials, cooperative pre-professional programs, and programs in quantitative studies and the societal impacts of technology. Every year, the college awards the $100,000 Grinnell College Innovator for Social Justice Prize, which is split between the recipient and their organization.

In 1975, Grinnell College through their Grinnell Communications subsidiary had purchased NBC affiliate WLWD from Avco Broadcasting Corporation for about $13 million. The station had changed its call letters to WDTN once the sale closed. Shortly after WDTN becoming an ABC affiliate, the station was sold off to Hearst Broadcasting for $45–$48 million.

In 2022, Grinnell became the first fully unionized undergraduate school in the U.S., when student workers voted to expand their dining hall workers union to include all student workers. The move was supported by the president of the college.

== Campus ==
Grinnell College is located in the town of Grinnell, Iowa, about halfway between Des Moines and Iowa City. The main campus, which was once a stop on the Underground Railroad, is bounded by 6th Avenue on the south, 10th Avenue on the north, East Street on the east and Park Street on the west. The campus contains sixty-three buildings ranging in style from Collegiate Gothic to Bauhaus to Tudor to Modernist. Goodnow Hall and Mears Cottage (1889) are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Immediately west of the college is the North Grinnell Historic District, which contains over 200 National Register of Historic Places contributing buildings.
The residential part of campus is divided into three sections: North Campus, East Campus, and South Campus. North and South Campus&#x27; dormitories are modeled explicitly after the residential colleges of Oxford and Cambridge. The four East Campus dormitories feature a modern, LEED-certified design constructed from Iowa limestone.

All three campuses feature dormitory buildings connected by loggia, an architectural signature of the college. The loggia on South Campus is the only entirely closed loggia, while the loggias on East and North campus are only partially closed. From the time that the first dorm opened in 1915 until the fall of 1968, the nine north campus dorms were used exclusively for male students, and the six south campus dorms reserved for female students. The dorm halls house significantly fewer students than halls at other colleges.

Most academic buildings are located on the southwestern quarter of campus. The athletic facilities are mostly located north of 10th Avenue.
The college maintains a environmental research area called the Conard Environmental Research Area (CERA). The U.S. Green Building Council awarded CERA&#x27;s Environmental Education Center a gold certification. The building is the first in Iowa to receive the designation.

During the 2000s, the college completed the Charles Benson Bear &#x27;39 Recreation and Athletic Center, the Bucksbaum Center for the Arts, the renovation of the Robert Noyce &#x27;49 Science Center and the Joe Rosenfield &#x27;25 Student Center. Internationally renowned architect César Pelli designed the athletics center, the Joe Rosenfield &#x27;25 Student Center, and the Bucksbaum Center for the Arts.

The college is in period of new construction which is expected to last until 2034.

== Academics ==
Grinnell&#x27;s open curriculum encourages students to take initiative and to assume responsibility for choosing their own courses of study. The sole core, or general education, requirement is the completion of the First-Year Tutorial, a one-semester, four-credit special topics seminar that stresses methods of inquiry, critical analysis, and writing skills. All other classes are chosen, with the direct guidance of a faculty member in the student&#x27;s major department, by the student.

Grinnell&#x27;s three most popular majors among 2021 graduates were Computer Science, Biology/Biological Sciences, and Research &amp; Experimental Psychology.

===Graduate programs===
Although the college does not offer any graduate degrees, it does have dual degree programs with several universities that let Grinnell students move directly into graduate programs. Grinnell participates in a 3–2 engineering dual degree program with Columbia University, Washington University in St. Louis, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and California Institute of Technology. It also has a 2–1–1–1 engineering program with Dartmouth College and a Master of Public Health cooperative degree program with University of Iowa.

=== Reputation ===
Grinnell College has been listed in each edition of Howard &amp; Matthew Greene&#x27;s guides The Hidden Ivies.
The 2025 annual ranking of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rates it tied for the 19th best liberal arts college overall in the U.S., tied for 9th for &quot;Best Undergraduate Teaching, 9th for &quot;Best Value&quot;, and tied for 33rd for &quot;Most Innovative&quot;.The Princeton Review ranks Grinnell as 10th in Best Classroom Experience. Grinnell is ranked 5th in the 2021 &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; rankings for liberal arts colleges, which focus on key outputs such as research, dollar value of scientific grants won, the number of graduates going on to earn Ph.D. degrees, and certain types of public service. The college has been consistently ranked in the top 25 liberal arts colleges in the nation since the publication began in 1983. &quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance&quot; ranked Grinnell 14th in its 2019 ranking of &quot;best value&quot; liberal arts colleges in the United States. In &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2015 rankings of academic institutions, &quot;America&#x27;s Top Colleges&quot; (which uses a non-traditional ranking system based on RateMyProfessors.com evaluations, notable alumni, student debt, percentage of students graduating in four years, and the number of students or faculty receiving prestigious awards), Grinnell College was ranked 81st among all colleges and universities, 21st among liberal arts colleges, and 10th in the Midwest.

=== Faculty ===
Grinnell had 173 full-time faculty in fall 2020, all of whom possess a doctorate or the terminal degree in their field. In 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Grinnell #9 in Best Undergraduate Teaching.

===Admission===

In 2019, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; classified Grinnell&#x27;s selectivity as &quot;most selective&quot;. For Fall 2022, Grinnell received 9,997 freshmen applications; 1,076 were admitted (10.76%). During the 2020-2021 application season, Grinnell offered a standardized test-optional application, due to limited testing access caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Grinnell College&#x27;s admission selectivity rating, according to The Princeton Review in 2018, is a 95 out of 99. This rating is determined by several institutionally reported factors, including: the class rank, average standardized test scores, and average high school GPA of entering freshmen; the percentage of students who hail from out-of-state; and the percentage of applicants accepted.

=== Graduation rates ===
Grinnell College is oriented towards students being enrolled full-time in exactly eight consecutive semesters at the college, although exceptions are available for medical issues and other emergencies. To avoid being suspended from the college, students must make &quot;normal progress towards graduation&quot;. This generally means that the student must pass at least 12 credits of classes in each individual semester, with grades C or higher, and have accumulated enough credits to make graduation possible at the end of four years, which requires an average of 15.5 credits each semester. A student who is not making normal progress towards graduation is placed on academic probation and may be dismissed from the college.

Nationwide, only 20% of college students complete a four-year undergraduate degree within four years, and only 57% of college students graduate within six years. However, at Grinnell College, 84% of students graduate within four years. This is the highest graduation rate of any college in Iowa.

== Tuition and financial aid ==

The sticker price for Grinnell&#x27;s combined tuition, room, board, and fees for the 2022–2023 academic year is $76,528. Tuition and fees are $61,480 and room and board are $15,048.

=== Need-blind admissions and full financial aid ===
Grinnell College is one of a few dozen US colleges that maintain need-blind admissions and meets the full demonstrated financial need of all U.S. residents who are admitted to the college. Grinnell offers a large amount of need-based and merit-based aid in comparison with peer institutions. Currently (2020–21), 86% of students receive some form of financial aid. In 2018–2019, 20% of students enrolled at Grinnell College were receiving federal Pell Grants, which are generally reserved for students from low-income families. The average financial aid package is over $51,770. Grinnell guarantees a $10,000 Grinnell Choice Scholarship renewable for eight semesters to all U.S. citizens and permanent residents admitted under the Early Decision program.

Beginning with the first-year students enrolled in the 2006–2007 school year, Grinnell ended its need-blind admissions policy for international applicants. Under the old policy, students from countries outside the U.S. were admitted without any consideration of their ability to afford four years of study at the college. However, financial aid offers to these students were limited to half the cost of tuition. International students frequently carried very high workloads in an effort to pay the bills, and their academic performance often suffered. Under the new &quot;need-sensitive&quot; or &quot;need-aware&quot; policy, international students whose demonstrated financial needs can be met are given a slight admissions edge over applicants who cannot. The twin hopes are that the enrolled international students will be able to dedicate more energy to their schoolwork, and also that this will ultimately allow the college to provide higher tuition grants to international students.

=== Paid internships ===
In addition to financial aid, students receive funding from the college for unpaid or underpaid summer internships and professional development (including international conferences and professional attire).

== Student body ==
In a 2014 study, compared to other US colleges with high four-year graduation rates, the economic diversity of students at Grinnell College was second only to Vassar College, indicating that it is accessible to students from low-income and middle-income families.

Grinnell is unusual for a selective school based in a small town for being able to attract a relatively large number of international students and US students of color. About a quarter of students are people of color. Most students come from outside the Midwestern United States, and less than 10% are from Iowa.

== Athletics ==

The school&#x27;s varsity sports teams are named the Pioneers. They participate in eighteen intercollegiate sports at the NCAA Division III level and in the Midwest Conference. In addition, Grinnell has several club sports teams that compete in non-varsity sports such as volleyball, sailing, water polo, ultimate and rugby union.

Nearly one-third of recent Grinnell graduates participated in at least one of varsity sports while attending the college and the college has led the Midwest Conference in the total number of Academic All-Conference honorees in last four years (as of 2021).

The Grinnell Pioneers won the first game of intercollegiate football west of the Mississippi when they beat the University of Iowa 24–0 on November 16, 1889.

The men&#x27;s water polo team, known as the Wild Turkeys, were runners-up in the 2007 College Water Polo Association (CWPA) Division III Collegiate National Club Championships hosted by Lindenwood University in St. Charles, Missouri. They also qualified for the tournament in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2014. The Men&#x27;s Ultimate team, nicknamed the Grinnellephants, qualified in 2008 for its first Division III National Championship in Versailles, Ohio. The Women&#x27;s Ultimate team, nicknamed The Sticky Tongue Frogs, tied for third place in the 2010 Division III National Championship in Appleton, Wisconsin. The success was repeated in 2011 when the men&#x27;s team placed third in 2011 Division III National Championship in Buffalo.

In February 2005, the Grinnell Pioneers men&#x27;s basketball team became the first Division III school featured in a regular season basketball game by the ESPN network family in 30 years when it faced off against the Beloit Buccaneers on ESPN2. Grinnell lost 86–85. Grinnell College&#x27;s basketball team attracted ESPN due to the team&#x27;s run and gun style of playing basketball, known in Grinnell simply as &quot;The System&quot;. Coach Dave Arseneault originated the Grinnell System that incorporates a continual full-court press, a fast-paced offense, an emphasis on offensive rebounding, a barrage of three-point shots and substitutions of five players at a time every 35 to 40 seconds. This allows a higher average playing time for more players than the &quot;starters&quot; and suits the Division III goals of scholar-athletes. &quot;The System&quot; has been criticized for not teaching the principles of defense. However, under &quot;The System&quot;, Grinnell has won three conference championships over the past ten years and have regularly placed in the top half of the conference. Coach Arseneault&#x27;s teams have set numerous NCAA scoring records and several individuals on the Grinnell team have led the nation in scoring or assists.

On November 19, 2011, Grinnell player Griffin Lentsch set a new Division III individual scoring record in a game against Principia College. The guard scored 89 points, besting the old record of 77, also set by a Pioneers player—Jeff Clement—in 1998. Lentsch made 27 of his 55 shots, including 15 three-pointers as Grinnell won the high-scoring game 145 to 97. On November 20, 2012, Grinnell&#x27;s Jack Taylor broke Lentsch&#x27;s scoring record, as well as the records for NCAA and collegiate scoring, in a 179–104 victory over Faith Baptist Bible College. Taylor scored 138 points on 108 shots, along with 3 rebounds, 6 turnovers and 3 steals. Taylor went 27 for 71 from behind the arc. Taylor scored 109 points in a November 2013 game against Crossroads College to become the first player in NCAA history to have two 100-point games.

In 2019, the Grinnell women&#x27;s volleyball team advanced to the NCAA Division III National Tournament for the first time in the 46-year history of the program, defeating St. Norbert College in a five-set thriller during the Midwest Conference Tournament championship match at Cornell College&#x27;s gymnasium. It also marked Grinnell&#x27;s first-ever MWC Tournament title in volleyball.

== Social activities and organizations ==
Students at Grinnell adhere to an honor system known as &quot;self-governance&quot; wherein they are expected to govern their own choices and behavior with minimal direct intervention by the college administration. By cultivating a community based on freedom of choice, self-governance aims to encourage students to become responsible, respectful, and accountable members of the campus, town, and global community.

Founded in November 2000, the student-run group Pioneer Capital Investments (PCI), formerly known as Student Endowment Investing Group, actively invests over $100,000 of Grinnell College&#x27;s endowment capital in public equities. The group&#x27;s mission is to provide interested students with valuable experience for future careers in finance. Two environmental organizations on campus produce and sell custom notebooks, using leftover paper from classwork and reused pasteboard from boxes originally holding breakfast cereal or other products.

Service organizations are popular. The Alternative Break (&quot;AltBreak&quot;) program takes students to pursue service initiatives during school holidays, and as of 2005, Grinnell had more alumni per capita serving in the Peace Corps than any other college in the nation. The college also runs its own post-graduation service program known as Grinnell Corps in Grinnell, China, Namibia, New Orleans, and Thailand, and has previously operated programs in Greece, Lesotho, Macau, and Nepal.

=== Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers ===
In 2016, students formed the Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers, or UGSDW, to represent student workers in the college&#x27;s dining hall. It was the first undergraduate student workers union at a private college in the United States. After several years of legal maneuvers, the USGDW and the college agreed that the college would be neutral in elections and abide by the results.

In April 2022, members of the UGSDW voted 327–6 to expand the union to all hourly paid student workers on campus, which made Grinnell the first and only fully unionized student-worker body in the country. In October 2022, the union and the college began the collective bargaining process.

<doc id="13109" wikidata="Q15278684" url="?curid=13109" title="List of climate change controversies">
<text>There are past and present public debates over certain aspects of climate change: how much has occurred in modern times, what causes it, what its effects will be, and what action should be taken to curb it now or later, and so forth. In the scientific literature, there is a very strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.

The controversies are, by now, mostly political rather than scientific: there is a scientific consensus that global warming is happening and is caused by human activity. Public debates that also reflect scientific debate include estimates of how responsive the climate system might be to any given level of greenhouse gases (climate sensitivity). Disputes over the key scientific facts of global warming are more prevalent in the media than in the scientific literature, where such issues are treated as resolved, and such disputes are more prevalent in the United States and Australia than globally.

== Debates around details in the science ==

There have been many debates around the details of climate change science. Climate change deniers and &quot;skeptics&quot; tend to cherry-pick data or studies, and then trump up any scientific discussions or apparent discrepancies that match with their agenda. Many of those apparent discrepancies have been reconciled in the meantime, climate models have become more accurate, the scientific consensus on climate change has strengthened and so forth. For example, climatologist Kevin E. Trenberth has published widely on the topic of climate variability and has exposed flaws in the publications of other scientists.

For past debates and controversies on scientific details see for example:
* History of climate change science#Discredited theories and reconciled apparent discrepancies
* Climate change denial#Discussing specific aspects of climate change science
* Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change#Challenges and controversies (the IPCC assessment reports, like the most recent IPCC Sixth Assessment Report summarise the state of the art of climate science at the time).
== Debates over most effective response to warming ==
There have been debates on the best responses to slow global warming, and their timing. The debates are around the specific actions for climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, or climate action in general. See for example:
*Economic analysis of climate change
*Climate change denial#Delaying climate change mitigation measures
*Climate change denial#Pushing for adaptation only
*Climate action (Climate crisis)

<text>George Bernard Dantzig (; November 8, 1914 – May 13, 2005) was an American mathematical scientist who made contributions to industrial engineering, operations research, computer science, economics, and statistics.

Dantzig is known for his development of the simplex algorithm, an algorithm for solving linear programming problems, and for his other work with linear programming. In statistics, Dantzig solved two open problems in statistical theory, which he had mistaken for homework after arriving late to a lecture by Jerzy Spława-Neyman.

At his death, Dantzig was professor emeritus of Transportation Sciences and Professor of Operations Research and of Computer Science at Stanford University.

==Early life==
Born in Portland, Oregon, George Bernard Dantzig was named after George Bernard Shaw, the Irish writer. He was born to Jewish parents; his father, Tobias Dantzig, was a mathematician and linguist, and his mother, Anja Dantzig (née Ourisson), was a Russian-born linguist of French-Lithuanian origin. Dantzig&#x27;s parents met during their study at the University of Paris, where Tobias studied mathematics under Henri Poincaré, after whom Dantzig&#x27;s brother was named. The Dantzigs emigrated to the United States, where they settled in Portland, Oregon.

Early in the 1920s the Dantzig family moved from Baltimore to Washington, D.C. His mother became a linguist at the Library of Congress, and his father became a math tutor at the University of Maryland, College Park.

==Education==
Dantzig attended Powell Junior High School and Central High School. By the time he reached high school, he was already fascinated by geometry, and this interest was further nurtured by his father, challenging him with complicated problems, particularly in projective geometry.

George Dantzig received his B.S. from University of Maryland in 1936 in mathematics and physics. He earned his master&#x27;s degree in mathematics from the University of Michigan in 1937. After working as a junior statistician at the Bureau of Labor Statistics from 1937 to 1939, he enrolled in the doctoral program in mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied statistics under Jerzy Spława-Neyman.

During his study in 1939, Dantzig solved two unproven statistical theorems due to a misunderstanding. Near the beginning of a class, Professor Spława-Neyman wrote two problems on the blackboard. Dantzig arrived late and assumed that they were a homework assignment. According to Dantzig, they &quot;seemed to be a little harder than usual&quot;, but a few days later he handed in completed solutions for both problems, still believing that they were an assignment that was overdue. Six weeks later, an excited Spława-Neyman eagerly told him that the &quot;homework&quot; problems he had solved were two of the most famous unsolved problems in statistics. He had prepared one of Dantzig&#x27;s solutions for publication in a mathematical journal. This story began to spread and was used as a motivational lesson demonstrating the power of positive thinking. Over time, some facts were altered, but the basic story persisted in the form of an urban legend and as an introductory scene in the movie &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;.

Dantzig recalled in a 1986 interview in the &quot;College Mathematics Journal&quot;, &quot;A year later, when I began to worry about a thesis topic, Spława-Neyman just shrugged and told me to wrap the two problems in a binder and he would accept them as my thesis.&quot;

Years later, another researcher, Abraham Wald, was preparing to publish a paper where he had arrived at a conclusion for the second problem when he learned of Dantzig&#x27;s earlier solution. When Dantzig suggested publishing jointly, Wald simply added Dantzig&#x27;s name as co-author.

== Career ==
With the outbreak of World War II, Dantzig took a leave of absence from the doctoral program at Berkeley to work as a civilian for the United States Army Air Forces. From 1941 to 1946, he became the head of the combat analysis branch of the Headquarters Statistical Control for the Army Air Forces. In 1946, he returned to Berkeley to complete the requirements of his program and received his PhD that year. Although he had a faculty offer from Berkeley, he returned to the Air Force as mathematical advisor to the comptroller.

In 1952, Dantzig joined the mathematics division of the RAND Corporation. By 1960, he became a professor in the Department of Industrial Engineering at UC Berkeley, where he founded and directed the Operations Research Center. In 1966, he joined the Stanford faculty as Professor of Operations Research and of Computer Science. A year later, the Program in Operations Research became a full-fledged department. In 1973, he founded the Systems Optimization Laboratory (SOL) there. On a sabbatical leave that year, he managed the Methodology Group at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria. Later, he became the C. A. Criley Professor of Transportation Sciences at Stanford University.

He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Dantzig was the recipient of many honors, including the first John von Neumann Theory Prize in 1974, the National Medal of Science in 1975, and an honorary doctorate from the University of Maryland, College Park in 1976. The Mathematical Programming Society honored Dantzig by creating the George B. Dantzig Prize, bestowed every three years since 1982 on one or two people who have made a significant impact in the field of mathematical programming. He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.

=== Research ===
Freund wrote further that &quot;through his research in mathematical theory, computation, economic analysis, and applications to industrial problems, Dantzig contributed more than any other researcher to the remarkable development of linear programming&quot;.

Dantzig&#x27;s work allows the airline industry, for example, to schedule crews and make fleet assignments. Based on his work, tools are developed &quot;that shipping companies use to determine how many planes they need and where their delivery trucks should be deployed. The oil industry long has used linear programming in refinery planning, as it determines how much of its raw product should become different grades of gasoline and how much should be used for petroleum-based byproducts. It is used in manufacturing, revenue management, telecommunications, advertising, architecture, circuit design and countless other areas&quot;.

====Linear programming====
Linear programming is a mathematical method for determining a way to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a given mathematical model for some list of requirements represented as linear relationships. Linear programming arose as a mathematical model developed during World War II to plan expenditures and returns in order to reduce costs to the army and increase losses to the enemy. It was kept secret until 1947. Postwar, many industries found its use in their daily planning.

The founders of this subject are Leonid Kantorovich, a Russian mathematician who developed linear programming problems in 1939, Dantzig, who published the simplex method in 1947, and John von Neumann, who developed the theory of the duality in the same year.

Dantzig was asked to work out a method the Air Force could use to improve their planning process. This led to his original example of finding the best assignment of 70 people to 70 jobs, showing the usefulness of linear programming. The computing power required to test all the permutations to select the best assignment is vast; the number of possible configurations exceeds the number of particles in the universe. However, it takes only a moment to find the optimum solution by posing the problem as a linear program and applying the Simplex algorithm. The theory behind linear programming drastically reduces the number of possible optimal solutions that must be checked.

In 1963, Dantzig&#x27;s &quot;Linear Programming and Extensions&quot; was published by Princeton University Press. The book quickly became a standard text in linear programming.

== Personal life ==
Dantzig married Anne S. Shmuner in 1936. He died on May 13, 2005, in his home in Stanford, California, of complications from diabetes and cardiovascular disease. He was 90 years old.

== Presidential award ==

On October 18, 1976, President Gerald Ford presented Dantzig with the National Medal of Science. The award was given &quot;For inventing linear programming and discovering methods that led to wide-scale scientific and technical applications to important problems in logistics, scheduling, and network optimization, and to the use of computers in making efficient use of the mathematical theory.&quot;

<text>Geoffrey Charles Ryman (born 1951) is a Canadian writer of science fiction, fantasy, slipstream and historical fiction. Ryman has written and published seven novels, including an early example of a hypertext novel, &quot;253&quot;. He has won multiple awards, including the World Fantasy Award.

==Biography==
Ryman was born in Canada and moved to the United States at age 11. He earned degrees in History and English at UCLA, then moved to England in 1973, where he has lived most of his life. He is gay.

In addition to being an author, Ryman started a web design team for the UK government at the Central Office of Information in 1994. He also led the teams that designed the first official British Monarchy and 10 Downing Street websites, and worked on the UK government&#x27;s flagship website, www.direct.gov.uk.

== Works ==
Ryman says he knew he was a writer &quot;before [he] could talk&quot;, with his first work published in his mother&#x27;s newspaper column at six years of age.
He is best known for his science fiction; however, his first novel was the fantasy &quot;The Warrior Who Carried Life&quot; (1985), and his revisionist fantasy of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Was...&quot; (1992), has been called &quot;his most accomplished work&quot;.

In 1996, Ryman began publishing instalments of &quot;253: A Novel for the Internet in Seven Cars and a Crash&quot; on the web. The work deals with the interconnected lives of 253 people on a Bakerloo line train in London, hurtling towards death, and is an early example of a hypertext novel. It was deeply personal to Ryman. &#x27;253 happens on January 11th, 1995,&#x27; he writes, &#x27;which is the day I learned my best friend was dying of Aids.&#x27; The project was intricate and lengthy, and took up a great deal of time, but in the 2000s, when Ryman was suffering from cancer, he accidentally failed to renew the URL, which was sold on, resulting in the loss of the project. In 2023, however, Ryman was able to restore it, and it became available online again.

Much of Ryman&#x27;s work is based on travels to Cambodia. The first of these, &quot;The Unconquered Country&quot; (1986), was winner of the World Fantasy Award and BSFA Award. His novel &quot;The King&#x27;s Last Song&quot; (2006) was set both in the Angkor Wat era and the time after Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge.

In 2023, after a significant hiatus between novels, Ryman published &quot;Him&quot;, an alternative history of Jesus Christ, in which Jesus is born biologically female, but identifies as male. &quot;New Scientist&quot; called it &#x27;provocative,&#x27; while Lisa Tuttle commented in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &#x27;It will offend those determined to be offended, but it is a serious, heartfelt exploration of profound human questions by one of our best writers.&#x27;

Ryman has written, directed and performed in several plays based on works by other writers.

He was guest of honour at Novacon in 1989 and has twice been a guest speaker at Microcon, in 1994 and in 2004. He was also the guest of honour at the national Swedish science fiction convention Swecon in 2006, at Gaylaxicon 2008, at Wiscon 2009, and at Åcon 2010. An article by Wendy Gay Pearson on Ryman&#x27;s novel &quot;The Child Garden&quot; won the British Science Fiction Foundation&#x27;s graduate essay award and was published in a special issue of &quot;Foundation&quot; on LGBT science fiction edited by Andrew M. Butler in 2002. Ryman&#x27;s works were also the subject of a special issue of &quot;Extrapolation&quot; in 2008, with articles dealing with &quot;Air, The Child Garden, Lust,&quot; and &quot;Was,&quot; in particular. Neil Easterbrook&#x27;s article in this special issue, &quot;&#x27;Giving An Account of Oneself&#x27;: Ethics, Alterity, Air&quot; won the 2009 Science Fiction Research Association Pioneer Award for best published article on science fiction (this award has since been renamed the SFRA Innovative Research Award). The issue includes an interview with Geoff Ryman by Canadian speculative fiction writer Hiromi Goto. The introduction to the special issue, by Susan Knabe and Wendy Gay Pearson, also responds to Ryman&#x27;s call for Mundane science fiction.

The Mundane SF movement was founded in 2002 during the Clarion Workshop by Ryman and other Clarion West Workshop instructors. In a 2004 manifesto on the subject, Ryman writes of the Mundane science fiction movement: &#x27;This movement proposes &quot;mundane science fiction&quot; as its own subgenre science fiction, typically characterized by its setting on Earth and a believable use of technology and science as it exists at the time the story is written or a plausible extension of existing technology.&#x27;

In 2008 a Mundane SF issue of &quot;Interzone&quot; magazine was published, guest-edited by Ryman, Julian Todd and Trent Walters.

Ryman has lectured at the University of Manchester since at least 2007; as of 2022 he is an Honorary Senior Lecturer in Creative Writing for University of Manchester&#x27;s English Department, where in 2011 he won the Faculty Students&#x27; Teaching Award for the School of Arts, History and Culture.

<doc id="13115" wikidata="Q189951" url="?curid=13115" title="Gametophyte">
<text>A gametophyte () is one of the two alternating multicellular phases in the life cycles of plants and algae. It is a haploid multicellular organism that develops from a haploid spore that has one set of chromosomes. The gametophyte is the sexual phase in the life cycle of plants and algae. It develops sex organs that produce gametes, haploid sex cells that participate in fertilization to form a diploid zygote which has a double set of chromosomes. Cell division of the zygote results in a new diploid multicellular organism, the second stage in the life cycle known as the sporophyte. The sporophyte can produce haploid spores by meiosis that on germination produce a new generation of gametophytes.

== Algae ==
In some multicellular green algae (&quot;Ulva lactuca&quot; is one example), red algae and brown algae, sporophytes and gametophytes may be externally indistinguishable (isomorphic). In &quot;Ulva&quot;, the gametes are isogamous, all of one size, shape and general morphology.

== Land plants ==
In land plants, anisogamy is universal. As in animals, female and male gametes are called, respectively, &quot;eggs&quot; and &quot;sperm.&quot; In extant land plants, either the sporophyte or the gametophyte may be reduced (heteromorphic). No extant gametophytes have stomata, but they have been found on fossil species like the early Devonian &quot;Aglaophyton&quot; from the Rhynie chert. Other fossil gametophytes found in the Rhynie chert shows they were much more developed than present forms, resembling the sporophyte in having a well-developed conducting strand, a cortex, an epidermis and a cuticle with stomata, but were much smaller.

=== Bryophytes ===
In bryophytes (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts), the gametophyte is the most visible stage of the life cycle. The bryophyte gametophyte is longer lived, nutritionally independent, and the sporophytes are attached to the gametophytes and dependent on them. When a moss spore germinates it grows to produce a filament of cells (called the protonema). The mature gametophyte of mosses develops into leafy shoots that produce sex organs (gametangia) that produce gametes. Eggs develop in archegonia and sperm in antheridia.

In some bryophyte groups such as many liverworts of the order Marchantiales, the gametes are produced on specialized structures called gametophores (or gametangiophores).

=== Vascular plants ===
All vascular plants are sporophyte dominant, and a trend toward smaller and more sporophyte-dependent female gametophytes is evident as land plants evolved reproduction by seeds.
Those vascular plants, such as clubmosses and many ferns, that produce only one type of spore are said to be homosporous. They have exosporic gametophytes — that is, the gametophyte is free-living and develops outside of the spore wall. Exosporic gametophytes can either be bisexual, capable of producing both sperm and eggs in the same thallus (monoicous), or specialized into separate male and female organisms (dioicous).

In heterosporous vascular plants (plants that produce both microspores and megaspores), the gametophytes develop endosporically (within the spore wall). These gametophytes are dioicous, producing either sperm or eggs but not both.

==== Ferns ====
In most ferns, for example, in the leptosporangiate fern &quot;Dryopteris&quot;, the gametophyte is a photosynthetic free living autotrophic organism called a prothallus that produces gametes and maintains the sporophyte during its early multicellular development. However, in some groups, notably the clade that includes Ophioglossaceae and Psilotaceae, the gametophytes are subterranean and subsist by forming mycotrophic relationships with fungi. Homosporous ferns secrete a chemical called antheridiogen.

==== Lycophytes ====
Extant lycophytes produce two different types of gametophytes. In the homosporous families Lycopodiaceae and Huperziaceae, spores germinate into bisexual free-living, subterranean and mycotrophic gametophytes that derive nutrients from symbiosis with fungi. In &quot;Isoetes&quot; and &quot;Selaginella&quot;, which are heterosporous, microspores and megaspores are dispersed from sporangia either passively or by active ejection. Microspores produce microgametophytes which produce sperm. Megaspores produce reduced megagametophytes inside the spore wall. At maturity, the megaspore cracks open at the trilete suture to allow the male gametes to access the egg cells in the archegonia inside. The gametophytes of &quot;Isoetes&quot; appear to be similar in this respect to those of the extinct Carboniferous arborescent lycophytes &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; and &quot;Lepidostrobus&quot;.

==== Seed plants ====
The seed plant gametophyte life cycle is even more reduced than in basal taxa (ferns and lycophytes). Seed plant gametophytes are not independent organisms and depend upon the dominant sporophyte tissue for nutrients and water. With the exception of mature pollen, if the gametophyte tissue is separated from the sporophyte tissue it will not survive. Due to this complex relationship and the small size of the gametophyte tissue—in some situations single celled—differentiating with the human eye or even a microscope between seed plant gametophyte tissue and sporophyte tissue can be a challenge. While seed plant gametophyte tissue is typically composed of mononucleate haploid cells (1 x n), specific circumstances can occur in which the ploidy does vary widely despite still being considered part of the gametophyte.

In gymnosperms, the male gametophytes are produced inside microspores within the microsporangia located inside male cones or microstrobili. In each microspore, a single gametophyte is produced, consisting of four haploid cells produced by meiotic division of a diploid microspore mother cell. At maturity, each microspore-derived gametophyte becomes a pollen grain. During its development, the water and nutrients that the male gametophyte requires are provided by the sporophyte tissue until they are released for pollination. The cell number of each mature pollen grain varies between the gymnosperm orders. Cycadophyta have 3 celled pollen grains while Ginkgophyta have 4 celled pollen grains. Gnetophyta may have 2 or 3 celled pollen grains depending on the species, and Coniferophyta pollen grains vary greatly ranging from single celled to 40 celled. One of these cells is typically a germ cell and other cells may consist of a single tube cell which grows to form the pollen tube, sterile cells, and/or prothallial cells which are both vegetative cells without an essential reproductive function. After pollination is successful, the male gametophyte continues to develop. If a tube cell was not developed in the microstrobilus, one is created after pollination via mitosis. The tube cell grows into the diploid tissue of the female cone and may branch out into the megastrobilus tissue or grow straight towards the egg cell. The megastrobilus sporophytic tissue provides nutrients for the male gametophyte at this stage. In some gymnosperms, the tube cell will create a direct channel from the site of pollination to the egg cell, in other gymnosperms, the tube cell will rupture in the middle of the megastrobilus sporophyte tissue. This occurs because in some gymnosperm orders, the germ cell is nonmobile and a direct pathway is needed, however, in Cycadophyta and Ginkgophyta, the germ cell is mobile due to flagella being present and a direct tube cell path from the pollination site to the egg is not needed. In most species the germ cell can be more specifically described as a sperm cell which mates with the egg cell during fertilization, though that is not always the case. In some Gnetophyta species, the germ cell will release two sperm nuclei that undergo a rare gymnosperm double fertilization process occurring solely with sperm nuclei and not with the fusion of developed cells. After fertilization is complete in all orders, the remaining male gametophyte tissue will deteriorate.

The female gametophyte in gymnosperms differs from the male gametophyte as it spends its whole life cycle in one organ, the ovule located inside the megastrobilus or female cone. Similar to the male gametophyte, the female gametophyte normally is fully dependent on the surrounding sporophytic tissue for nutrients and the two organisms cannot be separated. However, the female gametophytes of &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; do contain chlorophyll and can produce some of their own energy, though, not enough to support itself without being supplemented by the sporophyte. The female gametophyte forms from a diploid megaspore that undergoes meiosis and starts being singled celled. The size of the mature female gametophyte varies drastically between gymnosperm orders. In Cycadophyta, Ginkgophyta, Coniferophyta, and some Gnetophyta, the single celled female gametophyte undergoes many cycles of mitosis ending up consisting of thousands of cells once mature. At a minimum, two of these cells are egg cells and the rest are haploid somatic cells, but more egg cells may be present and their ploidy, though typically haploid, may vary. In select Gnetophyta, the female gametophyte stays singled celled. Mitosis does occur, but no cell divisions are ever made. This results in the mature female gametophyte in some Gnetophyta having many free nuclei in one cell. Once mature, this single celled gametophyte is 90% smaller than the female gametophytes in other gymnosperm orders. After fertilization, the remaining female gametophyte tissue in gymnosperms serves as the nutrient source for the developing zygote (even in Gnetophyta where the diploid zygote cell is much smaller at that stage, and for a while lives within the single celled gametophyte).

The precursor to the male angiosperm gametophyte is a diploid microspore mother cell located inside the anther. Once the microspore undergoes meiosis, 4 haploid cells are formed, each of which is a singled celled male gametophyte. The male gametophyte will develop via one or two rounds of mitosis inside the anther. This creates a 2 or 3 celled male gametophyte which becomes known as the pollen grain once dehiscing occurs. One cell is the tube cell, and the remaining cell/cells are the sperm cells. The development of the three celled male gametophyte prior to dehiscing has evolved multiple times and is present in about a third of angiosperm species allowing for faster fertilization after pollination. Once pollination occurs, the tube cell grows in size and if the male gametophyte is only 2 cells at this stage, the single sperm cell undergoes mitosis to create a second sperm cell. Just like in gymnosperms, the tube cell in angiosperms obtains nutrients from the sporophytic tissue, and may branch out into the pistil tissue or grow directly towards the ovule. Once double fertilization is completed, the tube cell and other vegetative cells, if present, are all that remains of the male gametophyte and soon degrade.

The female gametophyte of angiosperms develops in the ovule (located inside the female or hermaphrodite flower). Its precursor is a diploid megaspore that undergoes meiosis which produces four haploid daughter cells. Three of these independent gametophyte cells degenerate and the one that remains is the gametophyte mother cell which normally contains one nucleus. In general, it will then divide by mitosis until it consists of 8 nuclei separated into 1 egg cell, 3 antipodal cells, 2 synergid cells, and a central cell that contains two nuclei. In select angiosperms, special cases occur in which the female gametophyte is not 7 celled with 8 nuclei. On the small end of the spectrum, some species have mature female gametophytes with only 4 cells, each with one nuclei. Conversely, some species have 10-celled mature female gametophytes consisting of 16 total nuclei. Once double fertilization occurs, the egg cell becomes the zygote which is then considered sporophyte tissue. Scholars still disagree on whether the fertilized central cell is considered gametophyte tissue. Some botanists consider this endospore as gametophyte tissue with typically 2/3 being female and 1/3 being male, but as the central cell before double fertilization can range from 1n to 8n in special cases, the fertilized central cells range from 2n (50% male/female) to 9n (1/9 male, 8/9th female). However, other botanists consider the fertilized endospore as sporophyte tissue. Some believe it is neither.

==Heterospory==
In heterosporic plants, there are two distinct kinds of gametophytes. Because the two gametophytes differ in form and function, they are termed &quot;heteromorphic&quot;, from &quot;hetero&quot;- &quot;different&quot; and &quot;morph&quot; &quot;form&quot;. The egg-producing gametophyte is known as a megagametophyte, because it is typically larger, and the sperm producing gametophyte is known as a microgametophyte. Species which produce egg and sperm on separate gametophytes plants are termed dioicous, while those that produce both eggs and sperm on the same gametophyte are termed monoicous.

In heterosporous plants (water ferns, some lycophytes, as well as all gymnosperms and angiosperms), there are two distinct types of sporangia, each of which produces a single kind of spore that germinates to produce a single kind of gametophyte. However, not all heteromorphic gametophytes come from heterosporous plants. That is, some plants have distinct egg-producing and sperm-producing gametophytes, but these gametophytes develop from the same kind of spore inside the same sporangium; &quot;Sphaerocarpos&quot; is an example of such a plant.

In seed plants, the microgametophyte is called pollen. Seed plant microgametophytes consists of several (typically two to five) cells when the pollen grains exit the sporangium. The megagametophyte develops within the megaspore of extant seedless vascular plants and within the megasporangium in a cone or flower in seed plants. In seed plants, the microgametophyte (pollen) travels to the vicinity of the egg cell (carried by a physical or animal vector) and produces two sperm by mitosis.

In gymnosperms, the megagametophyte consists of several thousand cells and produces one to several archegonia, each with a single egg cell. The gametophyte becomes a food storage tissue in the seed.

In angiosperms, the megagametophyte is reduced to only a few cells, and is sometimes called the embryo sac. A typical embryo sac contains seven cells and eight nuclei, one of which is the egg cell. Two nuclei fuse with a sperm nucleus to form the primary endospermic nucleus which develops to form triploid endosperm, which becomes the food storage tissue in the seed.

<text>Gavoi is a &quot;comune&quot; in central Sardinia (Italy), part of the province of Nuoro, in the natural region of Barbagia. It overlooks Lake Gusana.

==History==

The territory of Gavoi is inhabited since the prenuragic period. During the middleage is cited various times in the list of villages and towns that paid the taxes to the Roman curia.

Gavoi was hit by the plague in the 18th century.

==Main sights==

The Roman church of San Gavino is Gavoi&#x27;s foremost sacred spot, through there are eight other ancient churches in the village. The village&#x27;s center contains rock houses with balconies, and a village fountain is known as &quot;Antana &#x27;e Cartzonna&quot;.

Near the lake are the archaeological areas of Orrui and San Michele di Fonni. A Roman bridge is submerged beneath the lake.

==Economy==
Mountain tourism is among the sources of income. Agriculture production include potatoes and cheese (the town is famous for its Fiore Sardo).

==Traditions and culture==
The &quot;tumbarinu&quot; is a traditional drum made of lamb skin, and more rarely, dog or donkey skin. The tumbarinu is often accompanied with the pipiolu, the traditional sheppard&#x27;s fife. The &quot;ballu tundu&quot;, is a traditional dance in the round, as in the Balkan area. Poetry is esteemed, including extemporaneous rhyme competitions on given topics.

The nearby Sanctuary of Madonna d&#x27;Itria hosts a palio, in this case a peculiar horse competition very similar to that of Siena.

<text>Grazia Maria Cosima Damiana Deledda (; or Gràtzia Deledda ; 27 September 1871 – 15 August 1936) was an Italian writer who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1926 &quot;for her idealistically inspired writings which with plastic clarity picture the life on her native island [i.e. Sardinia] and with depth and sympathy deal with human problems in general&quot;. She was the first Italian woman to receive the prize, and only the second woman in general after Selma Lagerlöf was awarded hers in 1909.

==Biography==
Deledda was born in Nuoro, Sardinia, into a middle-class family, to Giovanni Antonio Deledda and Francesca Cambosu, as the fourth of seven siblings. She attended elementary school (the minimum required at the time) and was then educated by a private tutor (a guest of one of her relatives) and moved on to study literature on her own. It was during this time that she started displaying an interest in writing short novels, mostly inspired by the life of Sardinian peasants and their struggles. Her teacher encouraged her to submit her writing to a newspaper and, at age 13, her first story was published in a local journal. Some of Deledda&#x27;s early works were published in the fashion magazine &quot;L&#x27;ultima moda&quot; between 1888 and 1889. In 1890 Trevisani published &quot;Nell&#x27;azzurro&quot; (Into the Blue), her first collection of short stories. Deledda&#x27;s main focus was the representation of poverty and the struggles associated with it through a combination of imaginary and autobiographical elements. Her family wasn&#x27;t particularly supportive of her desire to write.

Deledda&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Fiori di Sardegna&quot; (Flowers of Sardinia) was published in 1892. Her 1896 book &quot;Paesaggi sardi&quot;, published by Speirani, is characterized by a prose both informed by fiction and poetry. Around this time Deledda initiated a regular collaboration with newspapers and magazines, most notably &quot;La Sardegna&quot;, &quot;Piccola Rivista&quot; and &quot;Nuova Antologia&quot;. Her work earned significant visibility as well as critical interest. In October 1899, Deledda met Palmiro Madesani, a functionary of the Ministry of Finance, in Cagliari. Madesani and Deledda were married in 1900 and the couple moved to Rome right after the publication of Deledda&#x27;s &quot;Il vecchio della montagna&quot; (The Old Man from the Mountain, 1900). Despite the birth of her two sons, Sardus (1901) and Francesco &quot;Franz&quot; (1904), Deledda managed to continue to write prolifically, publishing about a novel a year.

In 1903 she published &quot;Elias Portolu&quot;, which was met with commercial and critical success, boosting her reputation as a writer. This was followed by &quot;Cenere&quot; (Ashes, 1904); &quot;L&#x27;edera&quot; (The Ivy, 1908); &quot;Sino al confine&quot; (To the Border, 1910); &quot;Colombi e sparvieri&quot; (Doves and Sparrows, 1912); and her most popular book, &quot;Canne al vento&quot; (Reeds in the Wind, 1913).

In 1916 &quot;Cenere&quot; was the inspiration for a silent movie with famed Italian actress Eleonora Duse. It was the first and only time that Duse, a theatre performer, appeared in a film. Deledda was one of the contributors of the nationalist women&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Lidel&quot;, which was established in 1919.

In 1926 Henrik Schück, a member of the Swedish Academy, nominated Deledda for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Deledda won &quot;for her idealistically inspired writings which with plastic clarity picture the life on her native island and with depth and sympathy deal with human problems in general.&quot; She was awarded the Prize in a ceremony in Stockholm in 1926. Her initial response to the news was &quot;Già?&quot; (&quot;Already?&quot;)

Deledda&#x27;s win contributed to an increase in popularity of her writing. Benito Mussolini, who had just consolidated his grip on power, sent Deledda a signed portrait of himself with a dedication where he expressed his &quot;profound admiration&quot; for the writer. Flocks of journalists and photographers started visiting her home in Rome. Deledda initially welcomed them but eventually grew tired of the attention. One day she noticed that her beloved pet crow, Checca, was visibly irritated by the commotion, with people constantly coming in and out of the house. &quot;If Checca has had enough, so have I,&quot; Deledda was quoted as saying, and she returned to a more retired routine.
The events also put a strain on Deledda&#x27;s extremely methodical writings schedule. Her day would start with a late breakfast, followed by a morning of hard reading, lunch, a quick nap and a few hours of writing before dinner.

Deledda continued to write even as she grew older and more fragile. Her subsequent works, &quot;La Casa del Poeta&quot; (The House of the Poet, 1930) and &quot;Sole d&#x27;Estate&quot; (Summer Sun, 1933), indicate a more optimistic view of life even as she was experiencing serious health issues.

Deledda died in Rome at the age of 64 of breast cancer. &quot;La chiesa della solitudine&quot; (The Church of Solitude, 1936), Deledda&#x27;s last novel, is a semi-autobiographical depiction of a young Italian woman coming to terms with a fatal disease. A completed manuscript of the novel &quot;Cosima&quot; was discovered after her death and published posthumously in 1937.

==Accolades==
Deledda&#x27;s work has been highly regarded by writers of Italian literature, including Luigi Capuana, Giovanni Verga, Enrico Thovez, , . Sardinian writers including Sergio Atzeni, Giulio Angioni and Salvatore Mannuzzu, were greatly influenced by her work, prompting them to found what has later become known as the Sardinian Literary Spring. In 1947 artist Amelia Camboni was commissioned a portrait of Deledda, currently standing close to her home in Rome in the Pincio neighbourhood.

Deledda&#x27;s birthplace and childhood home in Nuoro was declared a national heritage building and purchased in 1968 by the Municipality of Nuoro, which in 1979 handed it over to the Regional Ethnographic Institute (ISRE) for the symbolic price of 1,000 Italian Lire. The Institute transformed the house into a museum commemorating the writer, and it&#x27;s now called the Museo Deleddiano. The museum consists of ten rooms showcasing the most important episodes in Deledda&#x27;s life.
A coal power plant opened in Portoscuso in 1965. , this powerplant called Grazia Deledda has a capacity of 590 MW.

;Tribute
On 10 December 2017 Google celebrated her with a Google Doodle.

==Work==
The life, customs, and traditions of the Sardinian people are prominent in Deledda&#x27;s writing. She often relies on detailed geographical descriptions and her characters often present a strong connection with their place of origins. Many of her characters are outcasts who silently struggle with isolation. Overall Deledda&#x27;s work focuses on love, pain and death, upon which rests feelings of sin and fatality. Her novels tend to criticize social values and moral norms rather than the people who are victims of such circumstances.
In her works it can be recognized the influence of the verism of Giovanni Verga and, sometimes, also that of the decadentism of Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, although her writing style is not so ornate. Despite her groundbreaking role in Italian and World literature, Deledda has failed to be acknowledged as a feminist writer, possibly due to her tendency of depicting women&#x27;s pain and suffering as opposed to women&#x27;s autonomy.

<text>Glenn Theodore Seaborg ( ; April 19, 1912February 25, 1999) was an American chemist whose involvement in the synthesis, discovery and investigation of ten transuranium elements earned him a share of the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. His work in this area also led to his development of the actinide concept and the arrangement of the actinide series in the periodic table of the elements.

Seaborg spent most of his career as an educator and research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, serving as a professor, and, between 1958 and 1961, as the university&#x27;s second chancellor. He advised ten US presidents—from Harry S. Truman to Bill Clinton—on nuclear policy and was Chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission from 1961 to 1971, where he pushed for commercial nuclear energy and the peaceful applications of nuclear science. Throughout his career, Seaborg worked for arms control. He was a signatory to the Franck Report and contributed to the Limited Test Ban Treaty, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He was a well-known advocate of science education and federal funding for pure research. Toward the end of the Eisenhower administration, he was the principal author of the Seaborg Report on academic science, and, as a member of President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s National Commission on Excellence in Education, he was a key contributor to its 1983 report &quot;A Nation at Risk&quot;.

Seaborg was the principal or co-discoverer of ten elements: plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium and element 106, which, while he was still living, was named seaborgium in his honor. He said about this naming, &quot;This is the greatest honor ever bestowed upon me—even better, I think, than winning the Nobel Prize. Future students of chemistry, in learning about the periodic table, may have reason to ask why the element was named for me, and thereby learn more about my work.&quot; He also discovered more than 100 isotopes of transuranium elements and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally as part of the Manhattan Project where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the implosion-type atomic bomb. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in nuclear medicine and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, including iodine-131, which is used in the treatment of thyroid disease. In addition to his theoretical work in the development of the actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the lanthanide series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the transactinide and superactinide series.

After sharing the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Edwin McMillan, he received approximately 50 honorary doctorates and numerous other awards and honors. The list of things named after Seaborg ranges from the chemical element seaborgium to the asteroid 4856 Seaborg. He was a prolific author, penning numerous books and 500 journal articles, often in collaboration with others. He was once listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the person with the longest entry in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in America&quot;.

==Early life==
Glenn Theodore Seaborg was born in Ishpeming, Michigan, on April 19, 1912, the son of Herman Theodore (Ted) and Selma Olivia Erickson Seaborg. He had one sister, Jeanette, who was two years younger. His family spoke Swedish at home. When Glenn Seaborg was a boy, the family moved to Los Angeles County, California, settling in a subdivision called Home Gardens, later annexed to the City of South Gate, California. About this time he changed the spelling of his first name from Glen to Glenn.

Seaborg kept a daily journal from 1927 until he suffered a stroke in 1998. As a youth, Seaborg was both a devoted sports fan and an avid movie buff. His mother encouraged him to become a bookkeeper as she felt his literary interests were impractical. He did not take an interest in science until his junior year when he was inspired by Dwight Logan Reid, a chemistry and physics teacher at David Starr Jordan High School in Watts.

Seaborg graduated from Jordan in 1929 at the top of his class and received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in chemistry at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1933. He worked his way through school as a stevedore and a laboratory assistant at Firestone. Seaborg received his PhD in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1937 with a doctoral thesis on the &quot;Interaction of Fast Neutrons with Lead&quot;, in which he coined the term &quot;nuclear spallation&quot;.

Seaborg was a member of the professional chemistry fraternity Alpha Chi Sigma. As a graduate student in the 1930s Seaborg performed wet chemistry research for his advisor Gilbert Newton Lewis, and published three papers with him on the theory of acids and bases. Seaborg studied the text &quot;Applied Radiochemistry&quot; by Otto Hahn, of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin, and it had a major impact on his developing interests as a research scientist. For several years, Seaborg conducted important research in artificial radioactivity using the Lawrence cyclotron at UC Berkeley. He was excited to learn from others that nuclear fission was possible—but also chagrined, as his own research might have led him to the same discovery.

Seaborg also became an adept interlocutor of Berkeley physicist Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer had a daunting reputation and often answered a junior colleague&#x27;s question before it had even been stated. Often the question answered was more profound than the one asked, but of little practical help. Seaborg learned to state his questions to Oppenheimer quickly and succinctly.

==Pioneering work in nuclear chemistry==

Seaborg remained at the University of California, Berkeley, for post-doctoral research. He followed Frederick Soddy&#x27;s work investigating isotopes and contributed to the discovery of more than 100 isotopes of elements. Using one of Lawrence&#x27;s advanced cyclotrons, John Livingood, Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, iron-59 in 1937. Iron-59 was useful in the studies of the hemoglobin in human blood. In 1938, Livingood and Seaborg collaborated (as they did for five years) to create an important isotope of iodine, iodine-131, which is still used to treat thyroid disease. (Many years later, it was credited with prolonging the life of Seaborg&#x27;s mother.) As a result of these and other contributions, Seaborg is regarded as a pioneer in nuclear medicine and is one of its most prolific discoverers of isotopes.

In 1939 he became an instructor in chemistry at Berkeley, was promoted to assistant professor in 1941 and professor in 1945. University of California, Berkeley, physicist Edwin McMillan led a team that discovered element 93, which he named neptunium in 1940. In November, he was persuaded to leave Berkeley temporarily to assist with urgent research in radar technology. Since Seaborg and his colleagues had perfected McMillan&#x27;s oxidation-reduction technique for isolating neptunium, he asked McMillan for permission to continue the research and search for element 94. McMillan agreed to the collaboration. Seaborg first reported alpha decay proportionate to only a fraction of the element 93 under observation. The first hypothesis for this alpha particle accumulation was contamination by uranium, which produces alpha-decay particles; analysis of alpha-decay particles ruled this out. Seaborg then postulated that a distinct alpha-producing element was being formed from element 93.

In February 1941, Seaborg and his collaborators produced plutonium-239 through the bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with deuterons, they observed the creation of neptunium, element 93. But it then underwent beta-decay, forming a new element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Plutonium is fairly stable, but undergoes alpha-decay, which explained the presence of alpha particles coming from neptunium. Thus, on March 28, 1941, Seaborg, physicist Emilio Segrè and Berkeley chemist Joseph W. Kennedy were able to show that plutonium (then known only as element 94) was fissile, an important distinction that was crucial to the decisions made in directing Manhattan Project research. In 1966, Room 307 of Gilman Hall on the campus at the Berkeley, where Seaborg did his work, was declared a US National Historic Landmark.

In addition to plutonium, he is credited as a lead discoverer of americium, curium, and berkelium, and as a co-discoverer of californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium and seaborgium, the first element named after a living person. He shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1951 with Edwin McMillan for &quot;their discoveries in the chemistry of the first transuranium elements.&quot;

==Scientific contributions during the Manhattan Project==
On April 19, 1942, Seaborg reached Chicago and joined the chemistry group at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago, where Enrico Fermi and his group would later convert uranium-238 to plutonium-239 in a controlled nuclear chain reaction. Seaborg&#x27;s role was to figure out how to extract the tiny bit of plutonium from the mass of uranium. Plutonium-239 was isolated in visible amounts using a transmutation reaction on August 20, 1942, and weighed on September 10, 1942, in Seaborg&#x27;s Chicago laboratory. He was responsible for the multi-stage chemical process that separated, concentrated and isolated plutonium. This process was further developed at the Clinton Engineering Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and then entered full-scale production at the Hanford Engineer Works, in Richland, Washington.

Seaborg&#x27;s theoretical development of the actinide concept resulted in a redrawing of the periodic table into its current configuration with the actinide series appearing below the lanthanide series. Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His patent on curium never proved commercially viable because of the element&#x27;s short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household smoke detectors and thus provided a good source of royalty income to Seaborg in later years. Prior to the test of the first nuclear weapon, Seaborg joined with several other leading scientists in a written statement known as the Franck Report (secret at the time but since published) unsuccessfully calling on President Truman to conduct a public demonstration of the atomic bomb witnessed by the Japanese.

==Professor and Chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley==

After the conclusion of World War II and the Manhattan Project, Seaborg was eager to return to academic life and university research free from the restrictions of wartime secrecy. In 1946, he added to his responsibilities as a professor by heading the nuclear chemistry research at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory operated by the University of California on behalf of the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Seaborg was named one of the &quot;Ten Outstanding Young Men in America&quot; by the US Junior Chamber of Commerce in 1947 (along with Richard Nixon and others). Seaborg was elected a Member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1948. From 1954 to 1961 he served as associate director of the radiation laboratory. He was appointed by President Truman to serve as a member of the General Advisory Committee of the AEC, an assignment he retained until 1960.

Seaborg served as chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1958 to 1961. His term coincided with a relaxation of McCarthy-era restrictions on students&#x27; freedom of expression that had begun under his predecessor, Clark Kerr. In October 1958, Seaborg announced that the university had relaxed its prior prohibitions on political activity on a trial basis, and the ban on communists speaking on campus was lifted. This paved the way for the Free Speech Movement of 1964–65.

Seaborg was an enthusiastic supporter of Cal&#x27;s sports teams. San Francisco columnist Herb Caen was fond of pointing out that Seaborg&#x27;s surname is an anagram of &quot;Go Bears&quot;, a popular cheer at UC Berkeley. Seaborg was proud of the fact that the Cal Bears won their first and only National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball championship in 1959, while he was chancellor. The football team also won the conference title and played in the Rose Bowl that year. He served on the Faculty Athletic Committee for several years and was the co-author of a book, &quot;Roses from the Ashes: Breakup and Rebirth in Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Athletics&quot; (2000), concerning the Pacific Coast Conference recruiting scandal, and the founding of what is now the Pac-12, in which he played a role in restoring confidence in the integrity of collegiate sports.

Seaborg served on the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) during the Eisenhower administration. PSAC produced a report on &quot;Scientific Progress, the Universities, and the Federal Government&quot;, also known as the &quot;Seaborg Report&quot;, in November 1960, that urged greater federal funding of science. In 1959, he helped found the Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory with Clark Kerr.

==Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission==
After appointment by President John F. Kennedy and confirmation by the United States Senate, Seaborg was chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) from 1961 to 1971. His pending appointment by President-elect Kennedy was nearly derailed in late 1960 when members of the Kennedy transition team learned that Seaborg had been listed in a &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; article as a member of &quot;Nixon&#x27;s Idea Men&quot;. Seaborg said that as a lifetime Democrat he was baffled when the article appeared associating him with outgoing Vice President Richard Nixon, a Republican whom Seaborg considered a casual acquaintance.

During the early 1960s, Seaborg became concerned with the ecological and biological effects of nuclear weapons, especially those that would impact human life significantly. In response, he commissioned the Technical Analysis Branch of the AEC to study these matters further. Seaborg&#x27;s provision for these innovative studies led the US Government to more seriously pursue the development and possible use of &quot;clean&quot; nuclear weapons.

While chairman of the AEC, Seaborg participated on the negotiating team for the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), in which the US, UK, and USSR agreed to ban all above-ground test detonations of nuclear weapons. Seaborg considered his contributions to the achievement of the LTBT as one of his greatest accomplishments. Despite strict rules from the Soviets about photography at the signing ceremony, Seaborg used a tiny camera to take a close-up photograph of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev as he signed the treaty.
Seaborg enjoyed a close relationship with President Lyndon Johnson and influenced the administration to pursue the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Seaborg was called to the White House in the first week of the Nixon Administration in January 1969 to advise President Richard Nixon on his first diplomatic crisis involving the Soviets and nuclear testing. He clashed with Nixon presidential adviser John Ehrlichman over the treatment of a Jewish scientist, Zalman Shapiro, whom the Nixon administration suspected of leaking nuclear secrets to Israel.

Seaborg published several books and journal articles during his tenure at the AEC. He predicted the existence of elements beyond those on the periodic table, the transactinide series and the superactinide series of undiscovered synthetic elements. While most of these theoretical future elements have extremely short half-lives and thus no expected practical applications, he also hypothesized the existence of stable super-heavy isotopes of certain elements in an island of stability. Seaborg served as chairman of the AEC until 1971.

==Return to California==

Following his service as Chairman of the AEC, Seaborg returned to UC Berkeley where he was awarded the position of University Professor. At the time, there had been fewer University Professors at UC Berkeley than Nobel Prize winners. He also served as Chairman of the Lawrence Hall of Science where he became the principal investigator for Great Explorations in Math and Science (GEMS) working with director Jacqueline Barber. Seaborg served as chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1958 to 1961, and served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1972 and as president of the American Chemical Society in 1976.

In 1980, he transmuted several thousand atoms of bismuth-209 into gold () at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. His experimental technique, using the lab&#x27;s Bevalac particle accelerator, was able to remove protons and neutrons from the bismuth atoms by bombarding it with carbon and neon nuclei traveling near the speed of light. Seaborg&#x27;s technique would have been far too expensive to enable routine manufacturing of gold, but his work was close to the mythical Philosopher&#x27;s Stone. As gold has four fewer protons and (taking the only naturally occurring bulk isotopes of either) eight fewer neutrons than bismuth, a total of twelve nucleons have to be removed from the bismuth nucleus to produce gold using Seaborg&#x27;s method.

In 1981, Seaborg became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

In 1983, President Ronald Reagan appointed Seaborg to serve on the National Commission on Excellence in Education. The commission produced a report &quot;A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform&quot;, which focused national attention on education as a national issue germane to the federal government. In 2008, Margaret Spellings wrote that

Seaborg lived most of his later life in Lafayette, California, where he devoted himself to editing and publishing the journals that documented both his early life and later career. He rallied a group of scientists who criticized the science curriculum in the state of California, which he viewed as far too socially oriented and not nearly focused enough on hard science. California Governor Pete Wilson appointed Seaborg to head a committee that proposed changes to California&#x27;s science curriculum despite outcries from labor organizations and others.

==Personal life==

In 1942, Seaborg married Helen Griggs, the secretary of physicist Ernest Lawrence. Under wartime pressure, Seaborg had moved to Chicago while engaged to Griggs. When Seaborg returned to accompany Griggs for the journey back to Chicago, friends expected them to marry in Chicago. But, eager to be married, Seaborg and Griggs impulsively got off the train in the town of Caliente, Nevada, for what they thought would be a quick wedding. When they asked for City Hall, they found Caliente had none—they would have to travel north to Pioche, the county seat. With no car, this was no easy feat, but one of Caliente&#x27;s newest deputy sheriffs turned out to be a recent graduate of the Cal Berkeley chemistry department and was more than happy to do a favor for Seaborg. The deputy sheriff arranged for the wedding couple to ride up and back to Pioche in a mail truck. The witnesses at the Seaborg wedding were a clerk and a janitor. Glenn Seaborg and Helen Griggs Seaborg had seven children, of whom the first, Peter Glenn Seaborg, died in 1997 (his twin Paulette having died in infancy). The others were Lynne Seaborg Cobb, David Seaborg, Steve Seaborg, Eric Seaborg, and Dianne Seaborg.

Seaborg was an avid hiker. Upon becoming Chairman of the AEC in 1961, he commenced taking daily hikes through a trail that he blazed at the headquarters site in Germantown, Maryland. He frequently invited colleagues and visitors to accompany him, and the trail became known as the &quot;Glenn Seaborg Trail.&quot; He and his wife Helen are credited with blazing a trail in the East Bay area near their home in Lafayette, California. This trail has since become a part of the American Hiking Association&#x27;s cross-country network of trails. Seaborg and his wife walked the trail network from Contra Costa County all the way to the California–Nevada border.

Seaborg was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1972 and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) of London in 1985. He was honored as Swedish-American of the Year in 1962 by the Vasa Order of America. In 1991, the organization named &quot;Local Lodge Glenn T. Seaborg No. 719&quot; in his honor during the Seaborg Honors ceremony at which he appeared. This lodge maintains a scholarship fund in his name, as does the unrelated Swedish-American Club of Los Angeles.

Seaborg kept a close bond to his Swedish origin. He visited Sweden every so often, and his family were members of the Swedish &quot;Pemer Genealogical Society&quot;, a family association open for every descendant of the Pemer family, a Swedish family with German origin, from which Seaborg was descended on his mother&#x27;s side. (In recent years, after both men&#x27;s passings, it has been discovered that physicist colleague Edward J. Lofgren was also descended from the Pemer family.) Seaborg even responded to the Swedish king&#x27;s Nobel prize toast in his mother&#x27;s native region&#x27;s dialect, which he described as &quot;It was as if a Swede had &quot;y&#x27;alled&quot; in English with a Southern Accent.&quot;&quot;.

== Death ==
On August 24, 1998, while in Boston to attend a meeting by the American Chemical Society, Seaborg suffered a stroke, which led to his death six months later on February 25, 1999, at his home in Lafayette, 58 years and two days to the date that he discovered Plutonium.

==Honors and awards==

During his lifetime, Seaborg is said to have been the author or co-author of numerous books and 500 scientific journal articles, many of them brief reports on fast-breaking discoveries in nuclear science while other subjects, most notably the actinide concept, represented major theoretical contributions in the history of science. He held more than 40 patents—among them the only patents ever issued for chemical elements, americium and curium, and received more than 50 doctorates and honorary degrees in his lifetime. At one time, he was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as having the longest entry in Marquis &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in America&quot;. In February 2005, he was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In April 2011 the executive council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) selected Seaborg for inclusion in CSI&#x27;s Pantheon of Skeptics. The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism. His papers are in the Library of Congress.

Seaborg was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1948, the American Philosophical Society in 1952, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958. The American Chemical Society-Chicago Section honored him with the Willard Gibbs Award in 1966. The American Academy of Achievement presented Seaborg with the Golden Plate Award in 1972.
The element seaborgium was named after Seaborg by Albert Ghiorso, E. Kenneth Hulet, and others, who also credited Seaborg as a co-discoverer. It was named while Seaborg was still alive, which proved controversial. He influenced the naming of so many elements that with the announcement of seaborgium, it was noted in &quot;Discover&quot; magazine&#x27;s review of the year in science that he could receive a letter addressed in chemical elements: seaborgium, lawrencium (for the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory where he worked), berkelium, californium, americium. Seaborgium is the first element ever to have been officially named after a living person. The second element to be so named is oganesson, in 2016, after Yuri Oganessian.

The Province of Grosseto completely occupies the southern end of Tuscany, and with a territorial area of , it is the most extensive in the region and one of the least dense in population in Italy. The province is bordered to the northwest by the Province of Livorno, to the north by the Province of Pisa, to the northeast by the Province of Siena, and to the southeast by the Province of Viterbo in Lazio. To the south is the Tyrrhenian Sea, which includes the southern islands of the Tuscan archipelago, including Isola del Giglio and the smaller Giannutri islands and Formiche di Grosseto and Formica di Burano. The Arcipelago Toscano National Park spans both the provinces of Grosseto and Livorno, and includes the seven main islands of the Tuscan Archipelago: Elba, Isola del Giglio, Capraia, Montecristo, Pianosa, Giannutri, Gorgona, and some of the minor islands and rock outcrops. The highest point in the park is Mount Capanne, at in elevation, on the island of Elba. 

The Colline Metallifere (Metalliferous Hills) line the border in the south with Lazio, and contain the Natural Park of Maremma, that protects also some of the remainings of the large swamps that once covered the area. Other protected areas are the Diaccia Botrona marshland. The principal rivers are the Ombrone, Fiora, Albegna, Pecora, Bruna, Merse, , Farma and Chiarone. The coastline between the Gulf of Follonica and the mouth of the Chiarone is dominated by blue waters and pine forests, and is home to resorts such as Marina di Grosseto, Principina a Mare, Castiglione della Pescaia, Punta Ala, Puntone di Scarlino and Talamone. Lakes include Lago dell&#x27;Accesa, Lago di Burano, Lago di San Floriano and Lago Acquato.

<text>Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis (; 21 May 1792 – 19 September 1843) was a French mathematician, mechanical engineer and scientist. He is best known for his work on the supplementary forces that are detected in a rotating frame of reference, leading to the Coriolis effect. He was the first to apply the term &quot;travail&quot; (translated as &quot;work&quot;) for the transfer of energy by a force acting through a distance, and he prefixed the factor ½ to Leibniz&#x27;s concept of &quot;vis viva&quot;, thus specifying today&#x27;s &quot;kinetic energy&quot;.

==Biography==

Coriolis was born in Paris in 1792. In 1808 he sat the entrance exam and was placed second of all the students entering that year, and in 1816, he became a tutor at the École Polytechnique, where he did experiments on friction and hydraulics.

In 1829, Coriolis published a textbook, &quot;Calcul de l&#x27;Effet des Machines&quot; (&quot;Calculation of the Effect of Machines&quot;), which presented mechanics in a way that could readily be applied by industry. He established the correct expression for kinetic energy, &quot;½mv2&quot;, and its relation to mechanical work.

During the following years, Coriolis worked to extend the notions of kinetic energy and work to rotating systems. The first of his papers, &quot;Sur le principe des forces vives dans les mouvements relatifs des machines&quot; (On the principle of kinetic energy in the relative motion in machines), was read to the Académie des Sciences (Coriolis 1832). Three years later came the paper that would make his name famous, &quot;Sur les équations du mouvement relatif des systèmes de corps&quot; (On the equations of relative motion of a system of bodies). Coriolis&#x27;s papers do not deal with the atmosphere or even the rotation of the Earth, but with the transfer of energy in rotating systems like waterwheels. Coriolis discussed the supplementary forces that are detected in a rotating frame of reference and he divided these forces into two categories. The second category contained the force that would eventually bear his name. A detailed discussion may be found in Dugas.

In 1835, he published a mathematical work on collisions of spheres: &quot;Théorie Mathématique des Effets du Jeu de Billard&quot;, considered a classic on the subject.

Coriolis&#x27;s name began to appear in the meteorological literature at the end of the 19th century, although the term &quot;Coriolis force&quot; was not used until the beginning of the 20th century. Today, the name Coriolis has become strongly associated with meteorology, but all major discoveries about the general circulation and the relation between the pressure and wind fields were made without knowledge about Gaspard Gustave Coriolis.

Coriolis became professor of mechanics at the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures in 1829. Upon the death of Claude-Louis Navier in 1836, Coriolis succeeded him in the chair of applied mechanics at the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées and to Navier&#x27;s place in the Académie des Sciences. In 1838, he succeeded Dulong as &quot;Directeur des études&quot; (director of studies) in the École Polytechnique.

He died in 1843 at the age of 51 in Paris. His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

<doc id="13131" wikidata="Q298298" url="?curid=13131" title="Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians">
<text>Géza ( 940 – 997), also Gejza, was Grand Prince of the Hungarians from the early 970s. He was the son of Grand Prince Taksony and his OrientalKhazar, Pecheneg or Volga Bulgarianwife. He married Sarolt, a daughter of an Eastern Orthodox Hungarian chieftain. After ascending the throne, Géza made peace with the Holy Roman Empire. Within Hungary, he consolidated his authority with extreme cruelty, according to the unanimous narration of nearly contemporaneous sources. He was the first Hungarian monarch to support Christian missionaries from Western Europe. Although he was baptised (his baptismal name was Stephen), his Christian faith remained shallow and he continued to perform acts of pagan worship. He was succeeded by his son Stephen, who was crowned the first King of Hungary in 1000 or 1001.

==Early life==
Géza was the elder son of Taksony, Grand Prince of the Hungarians. His mother was his father&#x27;s wife &quot;from the land of the Cumans&quot;, according to the anonymous author of the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;. This anachronistic reference to the Cumans suggests that she was of Khazar, Pecheneg or Volga Bulgarian origin. The Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, who listed the descendants of Grand Prince Árpád around 950, did not mention Géza. Even so, Gyula Kristó wrote that Géza was born around 940 and the emperor ignored him because of his youth. The genuine form of his name was either &quot;Gyeücsa&quot; or &quot;Gyeusa&quot;, which is possibly a diminutive form of the Turkic title &quot;yabgu&quot;. Géza&#x27;s father arranged his marriage with Sarolta daughter of a Hungarian chieftain called Gyula, who ruled Transylvania independently of the grand prince and had converted to Christianity in Constantinople. Sarolt seems to have also adhered to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, according to Bruno of Querfurt&#x27;s remark on her &quot;languid and muddled Christianity&quot;.

==Reign==
Géza succeeded his father around 972. He adopted a centralizing policy, which gave rise to his fame as a merciless ruler. The longer version of his son&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; even states that Géza&#x27;s hands were &quot;defiled with blood&quot;. Pál Engel wrote that Géza carried out a &quot;large-scale purge&quot; against his relatives, which explains the lack of references to other members of the Árpád dynasty from around 972. Koppány, who continued to rule the southern parts of Transdanubia, is the only exception to this dearth of references. A marriage alliance between the German and Byzantine dynasties brought about a rapprochement between the two powers neighboring Hungary in 972. Géza decided to make peace with the Holy Roman Empire. First, a monk named Bruno sent by Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor arrived in Hungary around 972. Hungarian &quot;legates&quot; were present at a conference held by the emperor in Quedlinburg in 973.

A record on one Bishop Prunwart in the Abbey of Saint Gall mentions his success in baptising many Hungarians, including their &quot;king&quot;. The nearly contemporaneous Thietmar of Merseburg confirms that the conversion to Christianity of the pagan Hungarians started under Géza, who became the first Christian ruler of Hungary. His baptismal name was Stephen. However, Géza continued to observe pagan cults, which proves that his conversion to Christianity was never complete. Kristó and other historians have said that the first Roman Catholic diocese in Hungary, with its seat in Veszprém, was set up in Géza&#x27;s reign, but their view has not been unanimously accepted. A charter issued during his son&#x27;s reign states that Géza was the founder of the Benedictine Pannonhalma Archabbey.

Taking advantage of internal conflicts which emerged in the Holy Roman Empire after Emperor Otto II&#x27;s death, Géza invaded Bavaria and took the fortress of Melk in 983. In 991, the Bavarians launched a counter-attack which forced Géza to withdraw Hungarian forces from the territories east of the Vienna Woods. Furthermore, he renounced the lands east of the river Leitha in his peace treaty of 996 with Henry IV of Bavaria. Géza also arranged the marriage of his son and heir Stephen to Henry IV&#x27;s sister Giselle. Even before this marriage alliance, Géza convoked the Hungarian leaders to an assembly and forced them to take an oath confirming his son&#x27;s right to succeed him.

==Family==
Sarolt gave birth to at least three of Géza&#x27;s children: Stephen, who succeeded his father on the throne, and two unnamed daughters. Sarolt survived Géza, which suggests that she was also the mother of Géza&#x27;s daughters. Based on the &quot;Polish-Hungarian Chronicle&quot;, Szabolcs de Vajay wrote that the daughters&#x27; mother was Géza&#x27;s alleged second wife Adelaide of Poland, but this has not been widely accepted. Adelaide is only mentioned in the &quot;Polish–Hungarian Chronicle&quot;, which describes her as the sister of Mieszko I of Poland, but specialists have often questioned her existence. The chronicle attributes Géza&#x27;s conversion to Adelaide&#x27;s influence.

The following family tree presents Géza&#x27;s ancestry and his offspring.






&quot;*Whether Menumorut is an actual or an invented person is debated by modern scholars.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;**A Khazar or Pecheneg lady.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;***Samuel Aba might have been Géza&#x27;s grandson instead of his son-in-law.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;****The Aba family descending from them still flourished in the 14th century.&quot;

<doc id="13134" wikidata="Q16546828" url="?curid=13134" title="Gecko">
<text>Geckos are small, mostly carnivorous lizards that have a wide distribution, found on every continent except Antarctica. Belonging to the infraorder Gekkota, geckos are found in warm climates throughout the world. They range from .

Geckos are unique among lizards for their vocalisations, which differ from species to species. Most geckos in the family Gekkonidae use chirping or clicking sounds in their social interactions. Tokay geckos (&quot;Gekko gecko&quot;) are known for their loud mating calls, and some other species are capable of making hissing noises when alarmed or threatened. They are the most species-rich group of lizards, with about 1,500 different species worldwide.

All geckos, except species in the family Eublepharidae lack eyelids; instead, the outer surface of the eyeball has a transparent membrane, the brille. They have a fixed lens within each iris that enlarges in darkness to let in more light. Since they cannot blink, species without eyelids generally lick their own brilles when they need to clear them of dust and dirt, in order to keep them clean and moist.

Unlike most lizards, geckos are usually nocturnal and have excellent night vision; their colour vision in low light is 350 times more sensitive than human eyes. The nocturnal geckos evolved from diurnal species, which had lost the rod cells from their eyes. The gecko eye, therefore, modified its cone cells that increased in size into different types, both single and double. Three different photo-pigments have been retained, and are sensitive to ultraviolet, blue, and green. They also use a multifocal optical system that allows them to generate a sharp image for at least two different depths. While most gecko species are nocturnal, some species are diurnal and active during the day, which have evolved multiple times independently.

Many species are well known for their specialised toe pads, which enable them to grab and climb onto smooth and vertical surfaces, and even cross indoor ceilings with ease. Geckos are well known to people who live in warm regions of the world, where several species make their home inside human habitations. These, for example the house gecko, become part of the indoor menagerie and are often welcomed, as they feed on insect pests; including moths and mosquitoes. Like most lizards, geckos can lose their tails in defence, a process called autotomy; the predator may attack the wriggling tail, allowing the gecko to escape.

The largest species, &quot;Gigarcanum delcourti&quot;, is only known from a single, stuffed specimen probably collected in the 19th century found in the basement of the Natural History Museum of Marseille in Marseille, France. This gecko was long, and it was likely endemic to New Caledonia, where it lived in native forests. The smallest gecko, the Jaragua sphaero, is a mere long, and was discovered in 2001 on a small island off the coast of Hispaniola.

== Etymology ==
The Neo-Latin &quot;gekko&quot; and English &#x27;gecko&#x27; stem from Indonesian-Malaysian &quot;gēkoq&quot;, a Malay word borrowed from Javanese, from &quot;tokek&quot;, which imitates the sounds that some species like &quot;Tokay gecko&quot; make.

==Common traits==
Like other reptiles, geckos are ectothermic, producing very little metabolic heat. Essentially, a gecko&#x27;s body temperature is dependent on its environment. Also, to accomplish their main functions; such as locomotion, feeding, reproduction, etc., geckos must have a relatively elevated temperature.

===Shedding or molting===

All geckos shed their skin at fairly regular intervals, with species differing in timing and method. Leopard geckos shed at about two- to four-week intervals. The presence of moisture aids in the shedding. When shedding begins, the gecko speeds the process by detaching the loose skin from its body and eating it. For young geckos, shedding occurs more frequently, once a week, but when they are fully grown, they shed once every one to two months.

===Adhesion ability===
About 60% of gecko species have adhesive toe pads which allow them to adhere to most surfaces without the use of liquids or surface tension. Such pads have been gained and lost repeatedly over the course of gecko evolution. Adhesive toepads evolved independently in about eleven different gecko lineages, and were lost in at least nine lineages.

It was previously thought that the spatula-shaped setae arranged in lamellae on gecko footpads enable attractive van der Waals&#x27; forces (the weakest of the weak chemical forces) between the β-keratin lamellae / setae / spatulae structures and the surface. These van der Waals interactions involve no fluids; in theory, a boot made of synthetic setae would adhere as easily to the surface of the International Space Station as it would to a living-room wall, although adhesion varies with humidity. However, a 2014 study suggests that gecko adhesion is in fact mainly determined by electrostatic interaction (caused by contact electrification), not van der Waals or capillary forces.

The setae on the feet of geckos are also self-cleaning, and usually remove any clogging dirt within a few steps. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which has very low surface energy, is more difficult for geckos to adhere to than many other surfaces.

Gecko adhesion is typically improved by higher humidity, even on hydrophobic surfaces, yet is reduced under conditions of complete immersion in water. The role of water in that system is under discussion, yet recent experiments agree that the presence of molecular water layers (water molecules carry a very large dipole moment) on the setae, as well as on the surface, increase the surface energy of both, therefore the energy gain in getting these surfaces in contact is enlarged, which results in an increased gecko adhesion force. Moreover, the elastic properties of the b-keratin change with water uptake.

Gecko toes seem to be double-jointed, but this is a misnomer, and is properly called digital hyperextension. Gecko toes can hyperextend in the opposite direction from human fingers and toes. This allows them to overcome the van der Waals force by peeling their toes off surfaces from the tips inward. In essence, by this peeling action, the gecko separates spatula by spatula from the surface, so for each spatula separation, only some force necessary. (The process is similar to removing Scotch Tape from a surface.)

Geckos&#x27; toes operate well below their full attractive capabilities most of the time, because the margin for error is great depending upon the surface roughness, and therefore the number of setae in contact with that surface.

Use of small van der Waals force requires very large surface areas; every square millimetre of a gecko&#x27;s footpad contains about 14,000 hair-like setae. Each seta has a diameter of 5 μm. Human hair varies from 18 to 180 μm, so the cross-sectional area of a human hair is equivalent to 12 to 1300 setae. Each seta is in turn tipped with between 100 and 1,000 spatulae. Each spatula is 0.2 μm long (one five-millionth of a metre), or just below the wavelength of visible light.

The setae of a typical mature gecko would be capable of supporting a weight of : each spatula could exert an adhesive force of 5 to 25 nN. The exact value of the adhesion force of a spatula varies with the surface energy of the substrate to which it adheres. Recent studies have moreover shown that the component of the surface energy derived from long-range forces, such as van der Waals forces, depends on the material&#x27;s structure below the outermost atomic layers (up to 100 nm beneath the surface); taking that into account, the adhesive strength can be inferred.

Apart from the setae, phospholipids; fatty substances produced naturally in their bodies, also come into play. These lipids lubricate the setae and allow the gecko to detach its foot before the next step.

The origin of gecko adhesion likely started as simple modifications to the epidermis on the underside of the toes. This was recently discovered in the genus &quot;Gonatodes&quot; from South America. Simple elaborations of the epidermal spinules into setae have enabled &quot;Gonatodes humeralis&quot; to climb smooth surfaces and sleep on smooth leaves.

Biomimetic technologies designed to mimic gecko adhesion could produce reusable self-cleaning dry adhesives with many applications. Development effort is being put into these technologies, but manufacturing synthetic setae is not a trivial material design task.

==Skin==
Gecko skin does not generally bear scales, but appears at a macro scale as a papillose surface, which is made from hair-like protuberances developed across the entire body. These confer superhydrophobicity, and the unique design of the hair confers a profound antimicrobial action. These protuberances are very small, up to 4 microns in length, and tapering to a point. Gecko skin has been observed to have an anti-bacterial property, killing gram-negative bacteria when they come in contact with the skin.

The mossy leaf-tailed gecko of Madagascar, &quot;U. sikorae&quot;, has coloration developed as camouflage, most being greyish brown to black, or greenish brown, with various markings meant to resemble tree bark; down to the lichens and moss found on the bark. It also has flaps of skin, running the length of its body, head and limbs, known as the &quot;dermal flap&quot;, which it can lay against the tree during the day, scattering shadows, and making its outline practically invisible.

==Teeth==
As polyphyodonts, geckos can replace each of their 100 teeth every 3 to 4 months. Next to the full grown tooth there is a small replacement tooth developing from the odontogenic stem cell in the dental lamina. The formation of the teeth is pleurodont; they are fused (ankylosed) by their sides to the inner surface of the jaw bones.
This formation is common in all species in the order Squamata.
==Taxonomy and classification==
The infraorder Gekkota is divided into seven families, containing about 125 genera of geckos, including the snake-like (legless) pygopods.

*Family Carphodactylidae
*Family Diplodactylidae
*Family Eublepharidae
*Family Gekkonidae
*Family Phyllodactylidae
*Family Pygopodidae
*Family Sphaerodactylidae

Legless lizards of the family Dibamidae, also referred to as blind lizards, have occasionally been counted as gekkotans, but recent molecular phylogenies suggest otherwise.

=== Evolutionary history ===
Several species of lizard from the Late Jurassic have been considered early relatives of geckos, the most prominent and most well supported being the arboreal &quot;Eichstaettisaurus&quot; from the Late Jurassic of Germany. &quot;Norellius&quot; from the Early Cretaceous of Mongolia is also usually placed as a close relative of geckos. The oldest known fossils of modern geckos are from the mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber of Myanmar (including &quot;Cretaceogekko&quot;), around 100 million years old, which have adhesive pads on the feet similar to those of living geckos.

==Species==
More than 1,850 species of geckos occur worldwide, including these familiar species:
*&quot;Coleonyx variegatus&quot;, the western banded gecko, is native to the southwestern United States and northwest Mexico.
*&quot;Cyrtopodion brachykolon&quot;, the bent-toed gecko, is found in northwestern Pakistan; it was first described in 2007.
*&quot;Eublepharis macularius&quot;, the leopard gecko, is the most common gecko kept as a pet; it does not have adhesive toe pads and cannot climb the glass of a vivarium.
*&quot;Gehyra mutilata&quot; (&quot;Pteropus mutilatus&quot;), the stump-toed gecko, is able to vary its color from very light to very dark to camouflage itself; this gecko is at home in the wild, as well as in residential areas.
*&quot;Gekko gecko&quot;, the Tokay gecko, is a large, common, Southeast Asian gecko known for its aggressive temperament, loud mating calls, and bright markings.
*&quot;Hemidactylus&quot; is genus of geckos with many varieties.
**&quot;Hemidactylus frenatus&quot;, the common house gecko, thrives around people and human habitation structures in the tropics and subtropics worldwide.
**&quot;Hemidactylus garnotii&quot;, the Indo-Pacific gecko, is found in houses throughout the tropics, and has become an invasive species of concern in Florida and Georgia in the US.
**&quot;Hemidactylus mabouia&quot;, the tropical house gecko, Afro-American house gecko, or cosmopolitan house gecko, is a species of house gecko native to sub-Saharan Africa and also currently found in North, Central, and South America and the Caribbean.
**&quot;Hemidactylus turcicus&quot;, the Mediterranean house gecko, is frequently found in and around buildings, and is an introduced species in the US.
*&quot;Lepidodactylus lugubris&quot;, the mourning gecko, is originally an East Asian and Pacific species; it is equally at home in the wild and residential neighborhoods.
*&quot;Pachydactylus bibroni&quot;, Bibron&#x27;s gecko, is native to southern Africa; this hardy arboreal gecko is considered a household pest.
*&quot;Phelsuma laticauda&quot;, the gold dust day gecko, is diurnal; it lives in northern Madagascar and on the Comoros. It is also an introduced species in Hawaii.
*&quot;Ptychozoon&quot; is a genus of arboreal geckos from Southeast Asia also known as flying or parachute geckos; they have wing-like flaps from the neck to the upper leg to help them conceal themselves on trees and provide lift while jumping.
*&quot;Rhacodactylus&quot; is genus of geckos native to New Caledonia.
**&quot;Rhacodactylus ciliatus&quot; (now assigned to the genus &quot;Correlophus&quot;), the crested gecko, was believed extinct until rediscovered in 1994, and is gaining popularity as a pet.
**&quot;Rhacodactylus leachianus&quot;, the New Caledonian giant gecko, was first described by Cuvier in 1829; it is the largest living species of gecko.
*&quot;Sphaerodactylus ariasae&quot;, the dwarf gecko, is native to the Caribbean Islands; it is the world&#x27;s smallest lizard.
*&quot;Tarentola mauritanica&quot;, the crocodile or Moorish gecko, is commonly found in the Mediterranean region from the Iberian Peninsula and southern France to Greece and northern Africa; their most distinguishing characteristics are their pointed heads, spiked skin, and tails resembling those of a crocodile.

==Reproduction==
Most geckos lay a small clutch of eggs. Some are live-bearing, and a few can reproduce asexually via parthenogenesis. Geckos also have a large diversity of sex-determining mechanisms, including temperature-dependent sex determination and both XX/XY and ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes with multiple transitions among them over evolutionary time.
Madagascar day geckos engage in a mating ritual in which sexually mature males produce a waxy substance from pores on the back of their legs. Males approach females with a head swaying motion along with rapid tongue flicking in the female.

Obligate parthenogenesis as a reproductive system has evolved multiple times in the family Gekkonidae. It has been shown that oocytes are able to undergo meiosis in three different obligate parthenogenetic complexes of geckos. An extra premeiotic endoreplication of chromosomes is essential for obligate parthenogenesis in these geckos. Appropriate segregation during meiosis to form viable progeny is facilitated by the formation of bivalents made from copies of identical chromosomes.

<text>A game show (or gameshow) is a genre of broadcast viewing entertainment where contestants compete in a game for rewards. The shows are typically directed by a host, who explains the rules of the program as well as commentating and narrating where necessary. The history of the game shows dates back to the late 1930s when both radio and television game shows were broadcast. The genre became popular in the United States in the 1950s, becoming a regular feature of daytime television.

On most game shows, contestants answer questions or solve puzzles, and win prizes such as cash, trips and goods and services.

==History==
===1930s–1950s===

Game shows began to appear on radio and television in the late 1930s. The first television game show, &quot;Spelling Bee&quot;, as well as the first radio game show, &quot;Information Please&quot;, were both broadcast in 1938; the first major success in the game show genre was &quot;Dr. I.Q.&quot;, a radio quiz show that began in 1939.
&quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; was the first game show to air on commercially licensed television; &quot;CBS Television Quiz&quot; followed shortly thereafter as the first to be regularly scheduled. The first episode of each aired in 1941 as an experimental broadcast. Over the course of the 1950s, as television began to pervade the popular culture, game shows quickly became a fixture. Daytime game shows would be played for lower stakes to target stay-at-home housewives. Higher-stakes programs would air in prime time. (One particular exception in this era was &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, ostensibly a game show, but the game show concept was largely a framework for a talk show moderated by its host, Groucho Marx.) During the late 1950s, high-stakes games such as &quot;Twenty-One&quot; and &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot; began a rapid rise in popularity. However, the rise of quiz shows proved to be short-lived. In 1959, many of the higher stakes game shows were exposed as being either biased or outright scripted in the 1950s quiz show scandals and ratings declines led to most of the primetime games being canceled.

An early variant of the game show, the panel show, survived the quiz show scandals. On shows like &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, panels of celebrities would interview a guest in an effort to determine some fact about them; in others, celebrities would answer questions. Panel games had success in primetime until the late 1960s, when they were collectively dropped from television because of their perceived low budget nature. Panel games made a comeback in American daytime television (where the lower budgets were tolerated) in the 1970s through comedy-driven shows such as &quot;Match Game&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;. In the UK, commercial demographic pressures were not as prominent, and restrictions on game shows made in the wake of the scandals limited the style of games that could be played and the amount of money that could be awarded. Panel shows there were kept in primetime and have continued to thrive; they have transformed into showcases for the nation&#x27;s top stand-up comedians on shows such as &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;, &quot;Mock the Week&quot;, &quot;QI&quot;, and &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot;, all of which put a heavy emphasis on comedy, leaving the points as mere formalities. The focus on quick-witted comedians has resulted in strong ratings, which, combined with low costs of production, have only spurred growth in the UK panel show phenomenon.

===1950s–1970s===

Game shows remained a fixture of US daytime television through the 1960s after the quiz show scandals. Lower-stakes games made a slight comeback in daytime in the early 1960s; examples include &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; which began in 1964 and the original version of &quot;The Match Game&quot; first aired in 1962. &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; began in 1963 and the 1960s also marked the debut of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;Password&quot;, &quot;The Dating Game&quot;, and &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;.

Though CBS gave up on daytime game shows in 1968, the other networks did not follow suit. Color television was introduced to the game show genre in the late 1960s on all three networks. The 1970s saw a renaissance of the game show as new games and massive upgrades to existing games made debuts on the major networks. &quot;The New Price Is Right&quot;, an update of the 1950s-era game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, debuted in 1972 and marked CBS&#x27;s return to the game show format in its rural purge. &quot;The Match Game&quot; became &quot;Big Money&quot; &quot;Match Game 73&quot;, which proved popular enough to prompt a spin-off, &quot;Family Feud&quot;, on ABC in 1976. &quot;The $10,000 Pyramid&quot; and its numerous higher-stakes derivatives also debuted in 1973, while the 1970s also saw the return of formerly disgraced producer and game show host Jack Barry, who debuted &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; and a clean version of the previously rigged &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot; in the 1970s. &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; debuted on NBC in 1975. The Prime Time Access Rule, which took effect in 1971, barred networks from broadcasting in the 7–8 p.m. time slot immediately preceding prime time, opening up time slots for syndicated programming. Most of the syndicated programs were &quot;nighttime&quot; adaptations of network daytime game shows. These game shows originally aired once a week, but by the late 1970s and early 1980s most of the games had transitioned to five days a week. Many people were amazed at this and in the late 2000s, gameshows were aired 7 times a week, twice a day.

===1980s–1990s===
Game shows were the lowest priority of television networks and were rotated out every thirteen weeks if unsuccessful. Most tapes were wiped until the early 1980s. Over the course of the 1980s and early 1990s, as fewer new hits (e.g. &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;, &quot;Sale of the Century&quot;, and &quot;Card Sharks&quot;) were produced, game shows lost their permanent place in the daytime lineup. ABC transitioned out of the daytime game show format in the mid-1980s (briefly returning to the format for one season in 1990 with a &quot;Match Game&quot; revival). NBC&#x27;s game block also lasted until 1991, but the network attempted to bring them back in 1993 before cancelling its game show block again in 1994. CBS phased out most of its game shows, except for &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, by 1993. To the benefit of the genre, the moves of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and a modernized revival of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; to syndication in 1983 and 1984, respectively, was and remains highly successful; the two are, to this day, fixtures in the prime time &quot;access period&quot;.

Cable television also allowed for the debut of game shows such as &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot; and &quot;Debt&quot; (Lifetime), &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; and &quot;Family Challenge&quot; (Family Channel), and &quot;Double Dare&quot; (Nickelodeon). It also opened up a previously underdeveloped market for game show reruns. General interest networks such as CBN Cable Network (forerunner to Freeform) and USA Network had popular blocks for game show reruns from the mid-1980s to the mid-&#x27;90s before that niche market was overtaken by Game Show Network in 1994.

In the United Kingdom, game shows have had a more steady and permanent place in the television lineup and never lost popularity in the 1990s as they did in the United States, due in part to the fact that game shows were highly regulated by the Independent Broadcasting Authority in the 1980s and that those restrictions were lifted in the 1990s, allowing for higher-stakes games to be played.
After the popularity of game shows hit a nadir in the mid-1990s United States (at which point &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; was the only game show still on daytime network television and numerous game shows designed for cable television were canceled), the British game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; began distribution around the globe. Upon the show&#x27;s American debut in 1999, it was a hit and became a regular part of ABC&#x27;s primetime lineup until 2002; that show would eventually air in syndication for seventeen years afterward. Several shorter-lived high-stakes games were attempted around the time of the millennium, both in the United States and the United Kingdom, such as &quot;Winning Lines&quot;, &quot;The Chair&quot;, &quot;Greed&quot;, &quot;Paranoia&quot;, and &quot;Shafted&quot;, leading to some dubbing this period as &quot;The Million-Dollar Game Show Craze&quot;. The boom quickly went bust, as by July 2000, almost all of the imitator million-dollar shows were canceled (one of those exceptions was &quot;Winning Lines&quot;, which continued to air in the United Kingdom until 2004 even though it was canceled in the United States in early 2000); these higher stakes contests nevertheless opened the door to reality television contests such as &quot;Survivor&quot; and &quot;Big Brother&quot;, in which contestants win large sums of money for outlasting their peers in a given environment. Several game shows returned to daytime in syndication during this time as well, such as &quot;Family Feud&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, and &quot;Millionaire&quot;.

===2000s–present===
&quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Family Feud&quot; have continued in syndication. To keep pace with the prime-time quiz shows, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; doubled its question values in 2001 and lifted its winnings limit in 2003, which one year later allowed Ken Jennings to become the show&#x27;s first multi-million dollar winner; it has also increased the stakes of its tournaments and put a larger focus on contestants with strong personalities. The show has since produced four more millionaires: tournament winner Brad Rutter and recent champions James Holzhauer, Matt Amodio, and Amy Schneider. &quot;Family Feud&quot; revived in popularity with a change in tone under host Steve Harvey to include more ribaldry.

In 2009, actress and comedienne Kim Coles became the first black woman to host a prime time game show, &quot;Pay It Off&quot;.

The rise of digital television in the United States opened up a large market for rerun programs. Buzzr was established by Fremantle, owners of numerous classic U.S. game shows, as a broadcast outlet for its archived holdings in June 2015. There was also a rise of live game shows at festivals and public venues, where the general audience could participate in the show, such as the science-inspired &quot;Geek Out Game Show&quot; or the &quot;Yuck Show&quot;.

Since the early 2000s, several game shows were conducted in a tournament format; examples included &quot;History IQ&quot;, &quot;Grand Slam&quot;, &quot;PokerFace&quot; (which never aired in North America), &quot;Duel&quot;, &quot;The Million Second Quiz&quot;, &quot;500 Questions&quot;, &quot;The American Bible Challenge&quot;, and &quot;Mental Samurai&quot;. Most game shows conducted in this manner only lasted for one season.

A boom in prime time revivals of classic daytime game shows began to emerge in the mid-2010s. In 2016, ABC packaged the existing &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot;, which had returned in 2015, with new versions of &quot;To Tell the Truth,&quot; &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot;, and &quot;Match Game&quot; in 2016; new versions of &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; and &quot;Card Sharks&quot; would follow in 2019. TBS launched a cannabis-themed revival of &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;, hosted by Snoop Dogg, in October 2017. This is in addition to a number of original game concepts that appeared near the same time, including &quot;Awake&quot;, &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; (which originally aired in 2005), &quot;Child Support&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Game Night&quot;, &quot;1 vs. 100&quot;, &quot;Minute to Win It&quot; (which originally aired in 2010), &quot;The Wall&quot;, and a string of music-themed games such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Lyrics!&quot;, &quot;The Singing Bee&quot;, and &quot;Beat Shazam&quot;.

==International issues==

The popularity of game shows in the United States was closely paralleled around the world. Reg Grundy Organisation, for instance, would buy the international rights for American game shows and reproduce them in other countries, especially in Grundy&#x27;s native Australia. Dutch producer Endemol (later purchased by American companies Disney and Apollo Global Management, then resold to French company Banijay) has created and released numerous game shows and reality television formats popular around the world. Most game show formats that are popular in one country are franchised to others.

Game shows have had an inconsistent place in television in Canada, with most homegrown game shows there being made for the French-speaking Quebec market and the majority of English-language game shows in the country being rebroadcast from, or made with the express intent of export to, the United States. There have been exceptions to this (see, for instance, the long-running &quot;Definition&quot;). Unlike reality television franchises, international game show franchises generally only see Canadian adaptations in a series of specials, based heavily on the American versions but usually with a Canadian host to allow for Canadian content credits (one of those exceptions was &quot;Le Banquier&quot;, a Quebec French-language version of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; which aired on TVA from 2008 to 2015). The smaller markets and lower revenue opportunities for Canadian shows in general also affect game shows there, with Canadian games (especially Quebecois ones) often having very low budgets for prizes, unless the series is made for export. Canadian contestants are generally allowed to participate on American game shows, and there have been at least three Canadian game show hosts – Howie Mandel, Monty Hall and Alex Trebek – who have gone on to long careers hosting American series, while Jim Perry, an American host, was prominent as a host of Canadian shows.

American game shows have a tendency to hire stronger contestants than their British or Australian counterparts. Many of the most successful game show contestants in America would likely never be cast in a British or Australian game show for fear of having them dominate the game, according to Mark Labbett, who appeared in all three countries on the game show &quot;The Chase&quot;.

===Japanese game show===

The Japanese game show is a distinct format, borrowing heavily from variety formats, physical stunts and athletic competitions. The Japanese style has been adapted overseas (and at one point was parodied with an American reality competition, &quot;I Survived a Japanese Game Show&quot;, which used a fake Japanese game show as its central conceit).

==Prizes==

Many of the prizes awarded on game shows are provided through product placement, but in some cases they are provided by private organizations or purchased at either the full price or at a discount by the show. There is the widespread use of &quot;promotional consideration&quot;, in which a game show receives a subsidy from an advertiser in return for awarding that manufacturer&#x27;s product as a prize or consolation prize. Some products supplied by manufacturers may not be intended to be awarded and are instead just used as part of the gameplay such as the low-priced items used in several &quot;The Price is Right&quot; pricing games. Although in this show the smaller items (sometimes even in the single digits of dollars) are awarded as well when the price is correctly guessed, even when a contestant loses the major prize they were playing for.

For high-stakes games, a network may purchase prize indemnity insurance to avoid paying the cost of a rare but expensive prize out of pocket. If the said prize is won too often, the insurance company may refuse to insure a show; this was a factor in the discontinuation of &quot;The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular&quot; series of prime-time specials. In April 2008, three of the contestants on &quot;The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular&quot; won the top prize in a five-episode span after fifteen episodes without a winner, due in large part to a change in the rules. The insurance companies had made it extremely difficult to get further insurance for the remaining episodes. A network or syndicator may also opt to distribute large cash prizes in the form of an annuity, spreading the cost of the prize out over several years or decades.

From about 1960 through the rest of the 20th century, American networks placed restrictions on the amount of money that could be given away on a game show, in an effort to avoid a repeat of the scandals of the 1950s. This usually took the form of an earnings cap that forced a player to retire once they had won a certain amount of money or a limit on how many episodes, usually five, on which a player could appear on a show. The introduction of syndicated games, particularly in the 1980s, eventually allowed for more valuable prizes and extended runs on a particular show. British television was under even stricter regulations on prizes until the 1990s, seriously restricting the value of prizes that could be given and disallowing games of chance to have an influence on the results of the game. (Thus, the British version of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; at first did not include the American version&#x27;s &quot;Showcase Showdown&quot;, in which contestants spun a large wheel to determine who would advance to the Showcase bonus round.) In Canada, prizes were limited not by bureaucracy but necessity, as the much smaller population limited the audience of shows marketed toward that country. The lifting of these restrictions in the 1990s was a major factor in the explosion of high-stakes game shows in the later part of that decade in both the U.S. and Britain and, subsequently, around the world.

==Bonus round==
A bonus round (also known as a bonus game or an end game) usually follows a main game as a bonus to the winner of that game. In the bonus round, the stakes are higher and the game is considered to be tougher.

The game play of a bonus round usually varies from the standard game play of the front game, and there are often borrowed or related elements of the main game in the bonus round to ensure the entire show has a unified premise. Though some end games are referred to as &quot;bonus rounds&quot;, many are not specifically referred to as such in games but fit the same general role.

There is no one formula for the format of a bonus round. There are differences in almost every bonus round, though there are many recurring elements from show to show. The bonus round is often played for the show&#x27;s top prize. It is almost always played without an opponent; two notable exceptions to this are &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and the current version of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. On &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, the final round involves all remaining contestants with a positive score wagering strategically to win the game and be invited back the next day; &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; attempted to replace this round with a traditional solo bonus round in 1978, but this version was not a success and the round was replaced by the original Final Jeopardy! when the show returned in 1984. &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; uses a knockout tournament format, in which the six contestants to make it onstage are narrowed to two in a &quot;Showcase Showdown;&quot; these two winners then move on to the final Showcase round to determine the day&#x27;s winner.

Until the 1960s, most game shows did not offer a bonus round. In traditional two-player formats, the winner – if a game show&#x27;s rules provided for this – became the champion and simply played a new challenger either on the next show or after the commercial break.

One of the earliest forms of bonus rounds was the Jackpot Round of the original series &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;. After two rounds of performing stunts, the wife of the contestant couple would perform at a jackpot board for a prize. The contestant was shown a famous quotation or common phrase, and the words were scrambled. To win the announced bonus, the contestant had to unscramble the words within 20 seconds. The contestant received a consolation gift worth over $200 if she was unsuccessful.

Another early bonus round ended each episode of &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; with the team who won the most money answering one final question for a jackpot which started at $1,000 and increased $500 each week until won.

Another early example was the Lightning Round on the word game &quot;Password&quot;, starting in 1961. The contestant who won the front game played a quick-fire series of passwords within 60 seconds, netting $50 per correctly guessed word, for a maximum bonus prize of $250.

The bonus round came about after game show producer Mark Goodson was first presented &quot;Password&quot;, contending that it was not enough to merely guess passwords during the show. &quot;We needed something more, and that&#x27;s how the Lightning Round was invited,&quot; said Howard Felsher, who produced &quot;Password&quot; and &quot;Family Feud&quot;. &quot;From that point on every game show had to have an end round. You&#x27;d bring a show to a network and they&#x27;d say, &#x27;What&#x27;s the endgame?&#x27; as if they had thought of it themselves.&quot;

The end game of &quot;Match Game&quot;, hosted for most of its run by Gene Rayburn, served as the impetus for a completely new game show. The first part of &quot;Match Game&quot;″s &quot;Super-Match&quot; bonus round, called the &quot;Audience Match&quot;, asked contestants to guess how a studio audience responded to a question. In 1975, with then regular panelist Richard Dawson becoming restless and progressively less cooperative, Goodson decided that this line of questioning would make a good game show of its own, and the concept eventually became &quot;Family Feud&quot;, as whose inaugural host Dawson was hired.

<text>Grindcore is an extreme fusion genre of heavy metal and hardcore punk that originated in the mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from abrasive-sounding musical styles, such as thrashcore, crust punk, hardcore punk, extreme metal, and industrial. Grindcore is considered a more noise-filled style of hardcore punk while using hardcore&#x27;s trademark characteristics such as heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high-speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls, shouts and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups such as England&#x27;s Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.

A trait of grindcore is the &quot;microsong&quot;, which is far shorter than average for punk or metal; several bands have produced songs that are only seconds in length. Napalm Death holds the Guinness World Record for shortest song ever recorded with the 1.316-second &quot;You Suffer&quot; (1987). Many bands, such as Agoraphobic Nosebleed, record simple phrases that may be rhythmically sprawled out across an instrumental lasting only a couple of bars in length.

A variety of subgenres and microgenres have subsequently emerged, often labeling bands according to traits that deviate from regular grindcore; including goregrind, focused on themes of gore (e.g. mutilation and pathology), and pornogrind, fixated on pornographic lyrical themes. Another offshoot is cybergrind which incorporates electronic music elements such as sampling and programmed drums. Although influential within hardcore punk and extreme metal, grindcore remains an underground form of music.

== Characteristics ==
Grindcore is influenced by crust punk, thrashcore, hardcore punk and thrash metal, as well as noise musical acts like Swans. The name derives from the fact that &quot;grind&quot; is a British term for &quot;thrash&quot;; that term was prepended to &quot;-core&quot; from &quot;hardcore&quot;. Grindcore relies on standard hardcore punk instrumentation: electric guitar, bass and drums. However, grindcore alters the usual practices of metal or rock music in regard to song structure and tone. The vocal style is &quot;ranging from high-pitched shrieks to low, throat-shredding growls and barks.&quot; In some cases, no clear lyrics exist. Vocals may be used as merely an added sound effect, a common practice with bands such as the experimental and jazz-infused band Naked City.

A characteristic of some grindcore songs is the &quot;microsong,&quot; lasting only a few seconds. In 2001, the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; awarded Brutal Truth the record for &quot;Shortest Music Video&quot; for 1994&#x27;s &quot;Collateral Damage&quot; (the song lasts four seconds). In 2007, the video for the Napalm Death song &quot;You Suffer&quot; set a new &quot;Shortest Music Video&quot; record: 1.3 seconds. Beyond the microsong, it is characteristic of grindcore to have short songs in general; for example, Carcass&#x27; debut album &quot;Reek of Putrefaction&quot; (1988) consists of 22 tracks with an average length of 1 minute and 48 seconds. It is common for grindcore albums to be very short when compared to other genres, usually consisting of a large track list but having a total length of only 15 to 20 minutes.

Many grindcore groups experiment with tuned-down guitars and play mostly with downstrokes of the pick, power chords and heavy distortion. While the vinyl A-side of Napalm Death&#x27;s debut, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Scum&quot;, is set to Eb tuning, on side B, the guitars are tuned down to C. Their second album &quot;From Enslavement to Obliteration&quot; and the &quot;Mentally Murdered&quot; EP were tuned to C ♯. &quot;Harmony Corruption&quot;, their third full-length album, was tuned up to a D. Bolt Thrower went further, dropping 3½ steps down (A). Bass is tuned low as well, and is often distorted.

=== Blast beat ===
The blast beat is a drum beat characteristic of grindcore in all its forms, although its usage predates the genre itself, in Adam MacGregor&#x27;s definition, &quot;the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the kick drum, snare and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.&quot; Blast beats have been described as &quot;maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per se than sheer sonic violence.&quot; Napalm Death coined the term, though this style of drumming had previously been practiced by others. Daniel Ekeroth argues that the blast beat was first performed by the Swedish group Asocial on their 1982 demo. Lärm (&quot;Campaign For Musical Destruction&quot;) Dirty Rotten Imbeciles (&quot;No Sense&quot;), Stormtroopers of Death (&quot;Milk&quot;), Sarcófago (&quot;Satanas&quot;), Sepultura (&quot;Antichrist&quot;), and Repulsion also included the technique prior to Napalm Death&#x27;s emergence.

=== Lyrical themes ===
Grindcore lyrics are typically provocative. A number of grindcore musicians are committed to political and ethical causes, generally leaning towards the far left in connection to grindcore&#x27;s punk roots. For example, Napalm Death&#x27;s songs address a variety of anarchist concerns, in the tradition of anarcho-punk. These themes include anti-racism, feminism, anti-militarism, and anti-capitalism. Early grindcore bands including Napalm Death, Agathocles and Carcass made animal rights one of their primary lyrical themes. Some of them, such as Cattle Decapitation and Carcass, have expressed disgust with human behavior and animal abuse, and are, in some cases, vegetarians or vegans. Carcass&#x27; work in particular is often identified as the origin of the goregrind style, which is devoted to &quot;bodily&quot; themes. Groups that shift their bodily focus to sexual matters, such as Gut and the Meat Shits, are sometimes referred to as pornogrind. Seth Putnam&#x27;s lyrics are notorious for their black comedy, while The Locust tend toward satirical collage, indebted to William S. Burroughs&#x27; cut-up method.

== History ==
=== Precursors ===
The early grindcore scene relied on an international network of tape trading and DIY production. The most widely acknowledged precursors of the grindcore sound are Siege and Repulsion, an early death metal outfit. Siege, from Weymouth, Massachusetts, were influenced by classic American hardcore (Minor Threat, Black Flag, Void) and by British groups like Discharge, Venom, and Motörhead. Siege&#x27;s goal was maximum velocity: &quot;We would listen to the fastest punk and hardcore bands we could find and say, &#x27;Okay, we&#x27;re gonna deliberately write something that is faster than them, drummer Robert Williams recalled. Repulsion is sometimes credited with inventing the classic grind blast beat (played at 190 bpm), as well as its distinctive bass tone. Kevin Sharp of Brutal Truth declares that &quot;&quot;Horrified&quot; was and still is the defining core of what grind became; a perfect mix of hardcore punk with metallic gore, speed and distortion.&quot; Writer Freddy Alva credited NYC Mayhem as a notable precursor, calling them &quot;arguably one of the fastest bands on the planet back [in the mid 1980s]&quot;.

Other groups in the British grindcore scene, such as Heresy and Unseen Terror, have emphasized the influence of American hardcore punk, including Septic Death, as well as Swedish D-beat. Sore Throat cites Discharge, Disorder, and a variety of European D-beat and thrash metal groups, including Hellhammer, and American hardcore groups, such as Poison Idea and D.R.I. Japanese hardcore, particularly GISM, is also mentioned by a number of originators of the style. Other key groups cited by current and former members of Napalm Death as formative influences include Discharge, Amebix, Throbbing Gristle, and the aforementioned Dirty Rotten Imbeciles. Post-punk, such as Killing Joke and Joy Division, was also cited as an influence on early Napalm Death.

===British grindcore===
Grindcore, as such, was developed during the mid-1980s in the United Kingdom by Napalm Death, a group who emerged from the anarcho-punk scene in Birmingham, England. While their first recordings were in the vein of Crass, they eventually became associated with crust punk, The group began to take on increasing elements of thrashcore, post-punk, and power electronics, and began describing their sound as &quot;Siege with Celtic Frost riffs&quot;. The group also went through many changes in personnel. A major shift in style took place after Mick Harris became the group&#x27;s drummer. Punk historian Ian Glasper indicates that &quot;For several months gob-smacked audiences weren&#x27;t sure whether Napalm Death were actually a serious band any longer, such was the undeniable novelty of their hyper-speed new drummer.&quot; Albert Mudrian&#x27;s research suggests that the name &quot;grindcore&quot; was coined by Harris. When asked about coming up with the term, Harris said:

Other sources contradict Harris&#x27; claim. In a &quot;Spin&quot; magazine article written about the genre, Steven Blush declares that &quot;the man often credited&quot; for dubbing the style grindcore was Shane Embury, Napalm Death&#x27;s bassist since 1987. Embury offers his own account of how the grindcore &quot;sound&quot; came to be:

Earache Records founder Digby Pearson concurs with Embury, saying that Napalm Death &quot;put hardcore and metal through an accelerator.&quot; Pearson, however, said that grindcore &quot;wasn&#x27;t just about the speed of [the] drums, blast beats, etc.&quot; He claimed that &quot;it actually was coined to describe the guitars – heavy, downtuned, bleak, harsh riffing guitars [that] &#x27;grind&#x27;, so that&#x27;s what the genre was described as, by the musicians who were its innovators [and] proponents.&quot;

While abrasive, grindcore achieved a measure of mainstream visibility. &quot;New Musical Express&quot; featured Napalm Death on their cover in 1988, declaring them &quot;the fastest band in the world.&quot; As James Hoare, deputy editor of &quot;Terrorizer&quot;, writes:
Napalm Death&#x27;s seismic impact inspired other British grindcore groups in the 1980s, among them Extreme Noise Terror, Carcass and Sore Throat. Extreme Noise Terror, from Ipswich, formed in 1984. With the goal of becoming &quot;the most extreme hardcore punk band of all time,&quot; the group took Mick Harris from Napalm Death in 1987. Ian Glasper describes the group as &quot;pissed-off hateful noise with its roots somewhere between early Discharge and Disorder, with [vocalists] Dean [Jones] and Phil [Vane] pushing their trademark vocal extremity to its absolute limit.&quot; In 1991, the group collaborated with the acid house group The KLF, appearing onstage with the group at the Brit Awards in 1992. Carcass released &quot;Reek of Putrefaction&quot; in 1988, which John Peel declared his favorite album of the year despite its very poor production. The band&#x27;s focus on gore and anatomical decay, lyrically and in sleeve artwork, inspired the goregrind subgenre. Sore Throat, said by Ian Glasper to have taken &quot;perhaps the most uncompromisingly anti-music stance&quot; were inspired by crust punk as well as industrial music. Some listeners, such as Digby Pearson, considered them to be simply an in-joke or parody of grindcore.

In the subsequent decade, two pioneers of the style became increasingly commercially viable. According to Nielsen Soundscan, Napalm Death sold 367,654 units between May 1991 and November 2003, while Carcass sold 220,374 units in the same period. The inclusion of Napalm Death&#x27;s &quot;Twist the Knife (Slowly)&quot; on the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility, as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and went platinum in less than a year. The originators of the style have expressed some ambivalence regarding the subsequent popularity of grindcore. Pete Hurley, the guitarist of Extreme Noise Terror, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: &quot;&quot;grindcore&quot; was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and it had nothing to do with us whatsoever. ENT were, are, and – I suspect – always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you can come up with.&quot; Lee Dorrian of Napalm Death indicated that &quot;Unfortunately, I think the same thing happened to grindcore, if you want to call it that, as happened to punk rock – all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme.&quot;

=== North American grindcore ===
Journalist Kevin Stewart-Panko argues that the American grindcore of the 1990s borrowed from three sources: British grindcore, the American precursors, and death metal. As early Napalm Death albums were not widely distributed in the United States, American groups tended to take inspiration from later works, such as &quot;Harmony Corruption&quot;. American groups also often employ riffs taken from crossover thrash or thrash metal. Early American grind practitioners included Terrorizer and Assück. Anal Cunt, a particularly dissonant group who lacked a bass player, were also particularly influential. Their style was sometimes referred to as &quot;noisecore&quot; or &quot;noisegrind&quot;, described by Giulio of Cripple Bastards as &quot;the most anti-musical and nihilistic face of extreme music at that time.&quot; Brutal Truth was a groundbreaking group in the American scene at the beginning of the 1990s.

However, Sharp indicates that they were more inspired by the thrash metal of Dark Angel than the British groups. Discordance Axis had a more technical style of playing than many of the predecessors, and had a much more ornate visual and production style. Scott Hull is prominent in the contemporary grindcore scene, through his participation in Pig Destroyer and Agoraphobic Nosebleed. ANb&#x27;s &quot;Frozen Corpse Stuffed with Dope&quot; has been described as &quot;the &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; of grindcore&quot;, by &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Phil Freeman, for its &quot;hyper-referential, impossibly dense barrage of samples, blast beats, answering machine messages, and incomprehensibly bellowed rants.&quot; Pig Destroyer is inspired by thrash metal, such as Dark Angel and Slayer, the sludge metal of the Melvins, and grindcore practiced by Brutal Truth, while Agoraphobic Nosebleed takes cues from thrashcore and powerviolence, like D.R.I. and Crossed Out.
The Locust, from San Diego, also take inspiration from powerviolence (Crossed Out, Dropdead), first-wave screamo (Angel Hair), obscure experimental rock (Art Bears, Renaldo and the Loaf), and death metal. The Locust were sometimes described as &quot;hipster grind&quot; because of their fan base and fashion choices. In Los Angeles, Hole also initially drew influence from grindcore in their early releases, particularly on their singles &quot;Dicknail&quot; and &quot;Teenage Whore&quot;, as well as on their debut album, &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; (1991), all of which featured sexually provocative and violent lyrics, as well as the heavy distortion and fluctuating tempo that distinguished the genre. Frontwoman Courtney Love stated that she wanted to capture the distinguishing elements of grindcore while incorporating more pop-based melodic structure, although the band distanced themselves from the style in their later releases.

Other later prominent grindcore groups of North America include Brujeria, Soilent Green, Cephalic Carnage, Impetigo, and Circle of Dead Children. Fuck the Facts, a Canadian group, practice classic grindcore, characterized by the &quot;metronome-precision drumming and riffing [that] abound, as well as vocal screams and growls&quot; by &quot;AllMusic&quot; reviewer Greg Prato.

=== Continental European grindcore ===

European groups, such as Agathocles, from Belgium, Patareni, of Croatia, and Fear of God, from Switzerland, are important early practitioners of the style. Filthy Christians, who signed to Earache Records in 1989, introduced the style in Sweden, D.D.T. &amp; Fear of Dog were pioneering grind &amp; noise in Serbia since mid-end of &#x27;80, Extreme Smoke 57 in Slovenia at the early beginning of the &#x27;90, while Cripple Bastards established Italian grindcore. Giulio of Cripple Bastards asserts that the name itself took some time to migrate from Britain, with the style being referred to as &quot;death-thrashcore&quot; for a time in Europe.
Nasum, who emerged from the Swedish death metal scene, became a popular group, addressing political topics from a personal perspective.

Anders Jakobson, their drummer, reported that &quot;It was all these different types of people who enjoyed what we were doing. [...] We made grindcore a bit easier to listen to at the expense of the diehard grindcore fans who thought that we were, well, not sellouts, but not really true to the original essence of grindcore.&quot; Other Swedish groups, such as General Surgery and Regurgitate, practiced goregrind. Inhume, from the Netherlands, Rotten Sound, from Finland, and Leng Tch&#x27;e, from Belgium, were subsequent European groups who practiced grindcore with death metal inflections. In 2000s, the Belgium-based Aborted &quot;had grown into the role of key contributors to the death-grind genres&quot;.

=== Grindcore in Asian countries ===
In 2010, Singaporean band Wormrot signed a recording contract with Earache Records.

In 2019, Filipino band TUBERO signed a recording contract with Tower of Doom Records.

== Influence==
Japanese noise rock group Boredoms have borrowed elements of grind, and toured with Brutal Truth in 1993. The Japanese grindcore group Gore Beyond Necropsy formed in 1989, and later collaborated with noise music artist Merzbow. Naked City, led by avant-garde jazz saxophonist John Zorn, performed an avant-garde form of polystylistic, grindcore-influenced punk jazz. Zorn later formed the Painkiller project with ambient dub producer Bill Laswell on bass guitar and Mick Harris on drums, which also collaborated with Justin Broadrick on some work. In addition, grindcore was one influence on the powerviolence movement within American hardcore punk, and has affected some strains of metalcore. Some musicians have also produced hybrids between grind and electronic music.

=== Powerviolence ===

Powerviolence is a raw and dissonant subgenre of hardcore punk. The style is closely related to thrashcore and similar to grindcore. While powerviolence took inspiration from Napalm Death and other early grind bands, powerviolence groups avoided elements of heavy metal. Its nascent form was pioneered in the late 1980s in the music of hardcore punk band Infest, who mixed youth crew hardcore elements with noisier, sludgier qualities of Lärm and Siege. The microgenre solidified into its most commonly recognized form in the early 1990s, with the sounds of bands such as Man Is the Bastard, Crossed Out, No Comment, Capitalist Casualties, and Manpig.

Powerviolence bands focus on speed, brevity, bizarre timing breakdowns, and constant tempo changes. Powerviolence songs are often very short; it is not uncommon for some to last less than 30 seconds. Some groups, particularly Man Is the Bastard, took influence from sludge metal and noise music. Lyrically and conceptually, powerviolence groups were very raw and underproduced, both sonically and in their packaging. Some groups (Man Is the Bastard, Azucares and Dropdead) took influence from anarcho-punk and crust punk, emphasizing animal rights and anti-militarism. The Locust and Agoraphobic Nosebleed later reincorporated elements of powerviolence into grindcore.

=== Industrial and electronic influence ===
Among other influences, Napalm Death took impetus from the industrial music scene. Subsequently, Napalm Death&#x27;s former guitarist, Justin Broadrick, went on to a career in industrial metal with Godflesh. Mick Harris, in his post-Napalm Death project, Scorn, briefly experimented with the style. Scorn also worked in the industrial hip hop and isolationist styles. Fear Factory have also cited debts to the genre. Digital hardcore is an initially German hybrid of hardcore punk and hardcore techno. Agoraphobic Nosebleed and the Locust have solicited remixes from digital hardcore producers and noise musicians. James Plotkin, Dave Witte, and Speedranch participated in the Phantomsmasher project, which melds grindcore and digital hardcore. Alec Empire collaborated with Justin Broadrick, on the first Curse of the Golden Vampire album, and with Gabe Serbian, of the Locust, live in Japan. Japanoise icon Merzbow also participated in the Empire/Serbian show.

====Electrogrind====
The 21st century also saw the development of &quot;electrogrind&quot; (or &quot;cybergrind&quot;), practiced by The Berzerker, Gigantic Brain and Genghis Tron which borrows from electronic music. These groups built on the work of Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Enemy Soil and The Locust, as well as industrial metal. The Berzerker also appropriated the distorted Roland TR-909 kick drums of gabber producers. Bands like Libido Airbag and Cumfilled Brain incorporates elements of Grindcore, such as pitch-shifted, gurgled vocals, with the rhythmic structures of Techstep. Many later electrogrind groups were caricatured for their hipster connections.

=== Mathcore and screamo ===

In the mid-1990s, mathcore groups such as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Some Girls, and Daughters began to take inspiration from developments in grindcore. These groups also include elements of post-hardcore. In addition to mathcore, some early screamo groups, like Circle Takes the Square and Orchid, have been associated with grindcore by some commentators.

===Crust punk===
Crust punk had a major impact on grindcore&#x27;s emergence. The first grindcore, practiced by British bands such as Napalm Death, Extreme Noise Terror and Disrupt emerged from the crust punk scene. This early style is sometimes dubbed &quot;crustgrind&quot;.

===Deathgrind===
Deathgrind is a shorthand term that is used to describe bands who play a fusion of death metal and grindcore. With growing popularity of grindcore in the metal fandom, some death metal bands were noted to feature a heavy amount of grindcore influence; thus, these bands ended up becoming called &quot;deathgrind&quot; for short (sometimes written as &quot;death-grind&quot; or &quot;death/grind&quot;). Dan Lilker described deathgrind as &quot;combining the technicality of death metal with the intensity of grindcore.&quot; Some examples of death metal and grindcore hybrids include Assück, Circle of Dead Children, Misery Index, Exhumed, Gorerotted and Cattle Decapitation. Assück in particular has been credited as one of the earliest deathgrind acts.

===Blackened grindcore===
Blackened grindcore is a fusion genre that combines elements of black metal and grindcore. Notable bands include Anaal Nathrakh and early Rotting Christ.

===Noisegrind===
Noisegrind is a microgenre that combines elements of grindcore and harsh noise. Notable bands include Holy Grinder, Sete Star Sept, Full of Hell, Fear of God, Insufferable, and early Knelt Rote.

<text>George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach (; 5 April 1539 in Ansbach – 25 April 1603) was Margrave of Ansbach and Bayreuth, as well as Regent of Prussia. He was the son of George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach and a member of the House of Hohenzollern. He married firstly, in 1559, Elisabeth of Brandenburg-Küstrin (29 August 1540 – 8 March 1578). He married secondly, in 1579, Sophie of Brunswick-Lüneburg (30 October 1563 – 1639), daughter of William of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Dorothea of Denmark.

George Frederick reigned in his native Ansbach, Franconia and Jägerndorf, Upper Silesia since 1556 and, after the death of his cousin Albert Alcibiades in 1557, also in Kulmbach. He took over the administration of the Duchy of Prussia in 1577, when the then-reigning Duke Albert Frederick became ill.

He was the last of the old Franconia line of the House of Hohenzollern. Upon his death Ansbach and Kulmbach were inherited by younger princes of the Brandenburg line according to the House Treaty of Gera of 1598.

George Frederick rebuilt the palace and fortress of Plassenburg, which had been destroyed in the Second Margrave War (1552–1554). It became one of the most impressive residences of the Renaissance in Germany. He also built the fortress of Wülzburg and the old palace in Bayreuth.

During his reign between 1557 and 1603 in the Franconian territories of the Hohenzollern (Brandenburg-Ansbach and Brandenburg-Kulmbach) he kept peace, rebuilt cities and castles, founded several schools and a university.

<text>George of Brandenburg-Ansbach (German: &quot;Georg&quot;; 4 March 1484 – 27 December 1543), known as George the Pious (&quot;Georg der Fromme&quot;), was a Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach from the House of Hohenzollern.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

He was born in Ansbach, the second of eight sons of Margrave Frederick the Elder and his wife Sophia of Poland, daughter of Casimir IV of Poland and Elisabeth of Habsburg. Through his mother, he was related to the royal court in Buda. He entered the service of his uncle, King Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary, living at his court from 1506. The king received him as an adopted son, entrusted him in 1515 with the Duchy of Oppeln, and in 1516 made him member of the tutelary government instituted for Hungary, and tutor of his son Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia. In 1521 he made an arrangement with Petar Keglević and pulled back from Hungary and Croatia; this arrangement, accepted by Louis II in 1526, was not accepted by Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I until 1559.

=== Territories and influence ===
At the court of Hungary there were two parties arrayed against each other: the Magyar party under the leadership of Zápolyas and the German party under the leadership of George of Brandenburg, whose authority was increased by the acquisition of the duchies of Ratibor and Oppeln by hereditary treaties with their respective dukes and of the territories of Oderberg, Beuthen, and Tarnowitz as pledges from the king of Bohemia, who could not redeem his debts.

By the further appropriation of the Duchy of Jägerndorf, George came into possession of all Upper Silesia. As the owner and mortgagee of these territories he prepared the way for the introduction of the Protestant Reformation, here as well as in his native Franconia. Earlier than any other German prince or any other member of the Hohenzollern line including even his younger brother Albert, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, he turned his eyes and heart to the new faith proceeding from Wittenberg.

=== Conversion ===
The first reformatory writings began the work of winning him over to the evangelical cause. Martin Luther&#x27;s powerful testimony of faith at the Diet of Worms in 1521 made an indelible impression upon his mind, and the vigorous sermons of evangelical preachers in the pulpits of St. Lawrence and St. Sebald in Nuremberg, during the diet there in 1522, deepened the impression. The study of Luther&#x27;s translation of the New Testament, which appeared in 1522, established his faith on personal conviction. Moreover, he entered into correspondence with Luther, discussing with him the most important problems of faith, and in 1524 he met him personally during the negotiations concerning his brother Albert&#x27;s secularization of the Teutonic Order&#x27;s state of Prussia into the secular Duchy of Prussia.

After the accession of King Louis II, George was aided in his reforming efforts by Queen Maria, a sister of Charles V and Ferdinand I, who was favorably inclined toward the new doctrine. As the adviser of the young king, George firmly advocated the cause of the new gospel against the influences and intrigues of his clerical opponents and successfully prevented their violent measures. His relationship with Duke Frederick II of Liegnitz, Brieg, and Wohlau, and with Duke Charles I of Münsterberg-Oels, who had both admitted the Reformation into their territories, contributed not a little to the expansion of the gospel in his own lands. But it was his own personal influence, energy, and practical spirit that introduced the new doctrine and founded a new evangelical and churchly life. He made efforts to secure preachers of the new gospel from Hungary, Silesia, and Franconia, and tried to introduce the church order of Brandenburg-Nuremberg, which had already found acceptance in the Franconian territories.

=== Reformation in Franconia ===
In the hereditary lands Brandenburg-Ansbach in Franconia, where with his older brother Casimir of Brandenburg-Kulmbach he had assumed the regency in place of their father, he encountered greater difficulties, although the popular spirit was inclined toward the Reformation. Owing to his marriage with a Bavarian princess and to his military command in the imperial service, his brother was allied more closely with the old church and resisted the new reforming efforts. But the pressure of the estates of the land soon compelled him to allow preaching according to Luther&#x27;s doctrine, although he ensured retention of the old church ceremonies, even of those that were contrary to the new faith.

George protested against such half-measures and showed his dissatisfaction with the half-hearted resolutions of the state assembly of October 1526. It was only after the death of his brother that as sole ruler he could successfully undertake and carry out reformation in the Franconian territories, with the assistance of councillors such as Johann von Schwarzenberg and through the new resolutions of the state assembly of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1528). At the same time George maintained his correspondence with Luther and Philipp Melanchthon, discussing such questions as the evangelization of monasteries, the use of monastic property for evangelical purposes, and especially the foundation of lower schools for the people and of higher schools for the education of talented young men for the service of church and state. He despoiled the churches and cloisters in his domains of all their gold and silver, their monstrances, vessels, chalices, pearls, jewels, images and precious vestments. He used 50,000 florins of the proceeds to pay off Casimir&#x27;s gambling debts and other liabilities, and he endowed his son Frederick with ecclesiastical benefices with a total revenue of 190,000 florins. He tried to gain, by his continued correspondence with Luther and other reformers such as Urbanus Rhegius, efficient men for the preaching of the gospel and for the organization of the evangelical church. Hand in hand with the Council of Nuremberg he worked for the institution of a church visitation on the model of that of the Electorate of Saxony, from which after repeated revisions and emendations the excellent church order of Brandenburg-Nuremberg of 1533 was developed. After its introduction in Nuremberg and his territories in Franconia, it was also introduced in his dominions in Upper Silesia.

=== Influence beyond his territories ===
George&#x27;s influence manifested itself also in the development of the German Reformation as a whole. When a union of the evangelicals in upper and lower Germany was contemplated as a means of improved defense against the retaliatory measures of the Roman Catholic Church, George had a meeting with Elector John of Saxony at Schleitz in 1529, where they agreed on certain articles of faith and confession to be drawn up by Luther; the commission was executed in the seventeen articles of Schwabach on the basis of the fifteen theses of the Marburg Colloquy.

But neither at the Convention of Schwabach nor at that of Schmalkalden did George approve armed resistance against the emperor and his party, even in self-defense. He opposed the emperor energetically at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, when the emperor demanded the prohibition of evangelical preaching. King Ferdinand made George the most alluring offers of Silesian possessions if he would support the emperor, but he strongly rejected them. Next to the elector of Saxony, he stands foremost among the princes who defended the reformed faith. After the death of his cousin, Joachim I, who was a strict Catholic, he assisted his sons in the introduction of the Reformation in the territories of the Electorate of Brandenburg. He took part in the religious colloquy of Regensburg in 1541 where Elector Joachim II made a last attempt to bridge the differences between the Catholics and Lutherans and with his nephew requested Luther&#x27;s cooperation. The Diet of Regensburg was the last religious meeting which he attended.

He is one of the figures on the &quot;Prussian Homage&quot; painting by Jan Matejko.

== Family and children ==
George was married three times. His first marriage was to Beatrice de Frangepan (1480 – c. 1510) on 21 January 1509 in Gyula; the marriage produced no children.

George&#x27;s second marriage took place on 9 January 1525, to Hedwig of Münsterberg-Oels (1508–1531), daughter of Charles I of Münsterberg-Oels; their marriage produced two daughters:
* Anna Maria of Brandenburg-Ansbach (28 December 1526 – 20 May 1589); married Christoph, Duke of Württemberg in 1544.
* Sabina of Brandenburg-Ansbach (12 May 1529 – 2 November 1575); married John George, Elector of Brandenburg.

His third wife was Emilie of Saxony (27 July 1516 – 9 March 1591), daughter of Henry IV, Duke of Saxony, and Catherine of Mecklenburg on 25 August 1533:
* Sophie of Brandenburg-Ansbach (23 March 1535 – 12 February 1587) married Henry XI of Legnica on November 11, 1560.
* Barbara of Brandenburg-Ansbach (17 June 1536 – June 1591 in Kloster Himmelkron)
* Dorothy Catherine of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1538–1604); married in 1556 Henry V of Plauen, Burgrave of Meissen.
* George Frederick (1539–1603), who became Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach and Regent of the Duchy of Prussia.

<doc id="13143" wikidata="Q855729" url="?curid=13143" title="Generalized mean">
<text>In mathematics, generalised means (or power mean or Hölder mean from Otto Hölder) are a family of functions for aggregating sets of numbers. These include as special cases the Pythagorean means (arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means).

==Definition==
If is a non-zero real number, and formula_1 are positive real numbers, then the generalized mean or power mean with exponent of these positive real numbers is

formula_2

(See -norm). For we set it equal to the geometric mean (which is the limit of means with exponents approaching zero, as proved below):

formula_3

Furthermore, for a sequence of positive weights we define the weighted power mean as
formula_4
and when , it is equal to the weighted geometric mean:

formula_5

The unweighted means correspond to setting all .

== Special cases ==
A few particular values of yield special cases with their own names:
;minimum :formula_6
;harmonic mean :formula_7
;geometric mean formula_8
;arithmetic mean :formula_9
;root mean squareor quadratic mean :formula_10
;cubic mean :formula_11
;maximum :formula_12

{p} \right) }&lt;/math&gt;

In the limit , we can apply L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule to the argument of the exponential function. We assume that formula_13 but , and that the sum of is equal to 1 (without loss in generality); Differentiating the numerator and denominator with respect to , we have
formula_14

By the continuity of the exponential function, we can substitute back into the above relation to obtain
formula_15
as desired.}}

==Properties==

Let formula_1 be a sequence of positive real numbers, then the following properties hold:

#formula_17.
#formula_18, where formula_19 is a permutation operator.
#formula_20.
#formula_21.

=== Generalized mean inequality ===

In general, if , then
formula_22
and the two means are equal if and only if .

The inequality is true for real values of and , as well as positive and negative infinity values.

It follows from the fact that, for all real ,
formula_23
which can be proved using Jensen&#x27;s inequality.

In particular, for in , the generalized mean inequality implies the Pythagorean means inequality as well as the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means.

==Proof of the weighted inequality==
We will prove the weighted power mean inequality. For the purpose of the proof we will assume the following without loss of generality:
formula_24

The proof for unweighted power means can be easily obtained by substituting .

===Equivalence of inequalities between means of opposite signs===
Suppose an average between power means with exponents and holds:
formula_25
applying this, then:
formula_26

We raise both sides to the power of −1 (strictly decreasing function in positive reals):
formula_27

We get the inequality for means with exponents and , and we can use the same reasoning backwards, thus proving the inequalities to be equivalent, which will be used in some of the later proofs.

===Geometric mean===
For any and non-negative weights summing to 1, the following inequality holds:
formula_28

The proof follows from Jensen&#x27;s inequality, making use of the fact the logarithm is concave:
formula_29

By applying the exponential function to both sides and observing that as a strictly increasing function it preserves the sign of the inequality, we get
formula_30

Taking -th powers of the yields
formula_31

Thus, we are done for the inequality with positive ; the case for negatives is identical but for the swapped signs in the last step:

formula_32

Of course, taking each side to the power of a negative number swaps the direction of the inequality.

formula_33

===Inequality between any two power means===
We are to prove that for any the following inequality holds:
formula_34
if is negative, and is positive, the inequality is equivalent to the one proved above:
formula_35

The proof for positive and is as follows: Define the following function: formula_36. is a power function, so it does have a second derivative:
formula_37
which is strictly positive within the domain of , since , so we know is convex.

Using this, and the Jensen&#x27;s inequality we get:
formula_38
after raising both side to the power of (an increasing function, since is positive) we get the inequality which was to be proven:

formula_39

Using the previously shown equivalence we can prove the inequality for negative and by replacing them with and , respectively.

== Generalized &quot;f&quot;-mean ==
The power mean could be generalized further to the generalized -mean:

formula_40

This covers the geometric mean without using a limit with . The power mean is obtained for . Properties of these means are studied in de Carvalho (2016).

== Applications ==

===Signal processing===
A power mean serves a non-linear moving average which is shifted towards small signal values for small and emphasizes big signal values for big . Given an efficient implementation of a moving arithmetic mean called codice_1 one can implement a moving power mean according to the following Haskell code.
powerSmooth :: Floating a =&gt; ([a] -&gt; [a]) -&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
powerSmooth smooth p = map (** recip p) . smooth . map (**p)
* For big it can serve as an envelope detector on a rectified signal.
* For small it can serve as a baseline detector on a mass spectrum.

<doc id="13145" wikidata="Q184530" url="?curid=13145" title="Gerolamo Cardano">
<text>Gerolamo Cardano (; also Girolamo or Geronimo; ; ; 24 September 1501– 21 September 1576) was an Italian polymath whose interests and proficiencies ranged through those of mathematician, physician, biologist, physicist, chemist, astrologer, astronomer, philosopher, music theorist, writer, and gambler. He became one of the most influential mathematicians of the Renaissance and one of the key figures in the foundation of probability; he introduced the binomial coefficients and the binomial theorem in the Western world. He wrote more than 200 works on science.

Cardano partially invented and described several mechanical devices including the combination lock, the gimbal consisting of three concentric rings allowing a supported compass or gyroscope to rotate freely, and the Cardan shaft with universal joints, which allows the transmission of rotary motion at various angles and is used in vehicles to this day. He made significant contributions to hypocycloids - published in &quot;De proportionibus&quot;, in 1570. The generating circles of these hypocycloids, later named &quot;Cardano circles&quot; or &quot;cardanic circles&quot;, were used for the construction of the first high-speed printing presses.

Today, Cardano is well known for his achievements in algebra. In his 1545 book &quot;Ars Magna&quot; he made the first systematic use of negative numbers in Europe, published (with attribution) the solutions of other mathematicians for cubic and quartic equations, and acknowledged the existence of imaginary numbers.

== Early life and education ==

Cardano was born on 24 September 1501 in Pavia, Lombardy, the illegitimate child of Fazio Cardano, a mathematically gifted jurist, lawyer, and close friend of Leonardo da Vinci. In his autobiography, Cardano wrote that his mother, Chiara Micheri, had taken &quot;various abortive medicines&quot; to terminate the pregnancy; he said: &quot;I was taken by violent means from my mother; I was almost dead.&quot; She was in labour for three days. Shortly before his birth, his mother had to move from Milan to Pavia to escape the Plague; her three other children died from the disease.

After a depressing childhood, with frequent illnesses, and the rough upbringing by his overbearing father, in 1520, Cardano entered the University of Pavia. Against the wish of his father, who wanted his son to undertake studies of law, Girolamo felt more attracted to philosophy and science. During the Italian War of 1521–1526, however, the authorities in Pavia were forced to close the university in 1524. Cardano resumed his studies at the University of Padua, where he graduated with a doctorate in medicine in 1525. His eccentric and confrontational style did not earn him many friends and he had a difficult time finding work after he completed his studies. In 1525, Cardano repeatedly applied to the College of Physicians in Milan, but was not admitted owing to his combative reputation and illegitimate birth. However, he was consulted by many members of the College of Physicians, because of his irrefutable intelligence.

== Early career as a physician ==
Cardano wanted to practice medicine in a large, rich city like Milan, but he was denied a license to practice, so he settled for the town of Piove di Sacco, where he practised without a license. There, he married Lucia Banderini in 1531. Before her death in 1546, they had three children, Giovanni Battista (1534), Chiara (1537) and Aldo Urbano (1543). Cardano later wrote that those were the happiest days of his life.

With the help of a few noblemen, Cardano obtained a mathematics teaching position in Milan. Having finally received his medical license, he practised mathematics and medicine simultaneously, treating a few influential patients in the process. Because of this, he became one of the most sought-after doctors in Milan. In fact, by 1536, he was able to quit his teaching position, although he was still interested in mathematics. His notability in the medical field was such that the aristocracy tried to lure him out of Milan. Cardano later wrote that he turned down offers from the kings of Denmark and France, and the Queen of Scotland.

== Mathematics ==
Gerolamo Cardano was the first European mathematician to make systematic use of negative numbers. He published with attribution the solution of Scipione del Ferro to the cubic equation and the solution of Cardano&#x27;s student Lodovico Ferrari to the quartic equation in his 1545 book &quot;Ars Magna&quot;, an influential work on algebra. The solution to one particular case of the cubic equation formula_1 (in modern notation) had been communicated to him in 1539 by Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia (who later claimed that Cardano had sworn not to reveal it, and engaged Cardano in a decade-long dispute) in the form of a poem, but del Ferro&#x27;s solution predated Tartaglia&#x27;s. In his exposition, he acknowledged the existence of what are now called imaginary numbers, although he did not understand their properties, described for the first time by his Italian contemporary Rafael Bombelli. In &quot;Opus novum de proportionibus&quot; he introduced the binomial coefficients and the binomial theorem.

Cardano was chronically short of money and kept himself solvent by being an accomplished gambler and chess player. His book about games of chance, &quot;Liber de ludo aleae&quot; (&quot;Book on Games of Chance&quot;), written around 1564, but not published until 1663, contains the first systematic treatment of probability, as well as a section on effective cheating methods. He used the game of throwing dice to understand the basic concepts of probability. He demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes (which implies that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes). He was also aware of the multiplication rule for independent events but was not certain about what values should be multiplied.

==Other contributions==
Cardano was a music theorist who studied music privately in Milan in his youth. He wrote two treatises on music, both of which were titled &quot;De Musica&quot;. The first was published within his 1663 work &quot;Hieronymi Cardani Mediolanensis Opera Omnia&quot;. It is of interest to scholars on the history of woodwind instruments because of its discussion of instruments from that family. The second treatise was published in 1574, and a copy of it is held in the Vatican Library. The work is valuable for studies in harmony for its discussion of the use of microtones. It is also of interest to scholars of historically informed performance practice for its details on 16th century performance. The later treatise of music &quot;Della natura de principii et regole musicali&quot; which has been attributed to Cardano by some, is according to &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; most likely falsely attributed to Cardano and is by another writer. Cardano also dabbled in composing, writing the motet &quot; Beati estis&quot; which is scored for 12 voices and contains four overlapping canons. 

Cardano&#x27;s work with hypocycloids led him to Cardan&#x27;s Movement or Cardan Gear mechanism, in which a pair of gears with the smaller being one-half the size of the larger gear is used to convert rotational motion to linear motion with greater efficiency and precision than a Scotch yoke, for example. He is also credited with the invention of the Cardan suspension or gimbal.

Cardano made several contributions to hydrodynamics and held that perpetual motion is impossible, except in celestial bodies. He published two encyclopedias of natural science which contain a wide variety of inventions, facts, and occult superstitions. He also introduced the Cardan grille, a cryptographic writing tool, in 1550.

Significantly, in the history of education of the deaf, he said that deaf people were capable of using their minds, argued for the importance of teaching them, and was one of the first to state that deaf people could learn to read and write without learning how to speak first. He was familiar with a report by Rudolph Agricola about a deaf-mute who had learned to write.

Cardano&#x27;s medical writings included: a commentary on Mundinus&#x27; anatomy and of Galen&#x27;s medicine, along with the treaties &quot;Delle cause, dei segni e dei luoghi delle malattie&quot;, &quot;Picciola terapeutica&quot;, &quot;Degli abusi dei medici&quot; and &quot;Delle orine, libro quattro&quot;.

Cardano has been credited with the invention of the so-called &quot;Cardano&#x27;s Rings&quot;, also called Chinese Rings, but it is very probable that they predate Cardano. The universal joint, sometimes called &quot;Cardan joint&quot;, was not described by Cardano.

== &quot;De Subtilitate&quot; (1550) ==
As quoted from Charles Lyell&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Geology&quot;:

The title of a work of Cardano&#x27;s, published in 1552, &quot;De Subtilitate&quot; (corresponding to what would now be called transcendental philosophy), would lead us to expect, in the chapter on minerals, many far fetched theories characteristic of that age; but when treating of petrified shells, he decided that they clearly indicated the former sojourn of the sea upon the mountains.
== Scotland and Archbishop Hamilton ==

In 1552 Cardano travelled to Scotland with the Spanish physician William Casanatus, via London, to treat the Archbishop of St Andrews who suffered of a disease that had left him speechless and was thought incurable. The treatment was a success and the diplomat Thomas Randolph recorded that &quot;merry tales&quot; about Cardano&#x27;s methods were still current in Edinburgh in 1562. Cardano and Casanatus argued over the Archbishop&#x27;s cure. Cardano wrote that the Archbishop had been short of breath for ten years, and after the cure was effected by his assistant, he was paid 1,400 gold crowns.

== Later years and death ==
Two of Cardano&#x27;s children — Giovanni Battista and Aldo Urbano — came to ignoble ends. Giovanni Battista, Cardano&#x27;s eldest and favourite son was arrested in 1560 for having poisoned his wife, after he had discovered that their three children were not his. Giovanni was put to trial and, when Cardano could not pay the restitution demanded by the victim&#x27;s family, was sentenced to death and beheaded. Gerolamo&#x27;s other son Aldo Urbano was a gambler, who stole money from his father, and so Cardano disinherited him in 1569.

Cardano moved from Pavia to Bologna, in part because he believed that the decision to execute his son was influenced by Gerolamo&#x27;s battles with the academic establishment in Pavia, and his colleagues&#x27; jealousy at his scientific achievements, and also because he was beset with allegations of sexual impropriety with his students. He obtained a position as professor of medicine at the University of Bologna.

Cardano was arrested by the Inquisition in 1570 after an accusation of heresy by the Inquisitor of Como, who targeted Cardano&#x27;s &quot;De rerum varietate&quot; (1557). The inquisitors complained about Cardano&#x27;s writings on astrology, especially his claim that self-harming religiously motivated actions of martyrs and heretics were caused by the stars. In his 1543 book &quot;De Supplemento Almanach&quot;, a commentary on the astrological work &quot;Tetrabiblos&quot; by Ptolemy, Cardano had also published a horoscope of Jesus. Cardano was imprisoned for several months and lost his professorship in Bologna. He abjured and was freed, probably with help from powerful churchmen in Rome. All his non-medical works were prohibited and placed on the Index.

He moved to Rome, where he received a lifetime annuity from Pope Gregory XIII (after first having been rejected by Pope Pius V, who died in 1572) and finished his autobiography. He was accepted into the Royal College of Physicians, and as well as practising medicine he continued his philosophical studies until his death in 1576.

== References in literature and culture==
The seventeenth-century English physician and philosopher Sir Thomas Browne possessed the ten volumes of the Lyon 1663 edition of the complete works of Cardan in his library.

Browne critically viewed Cardan as:
that famous Physician of Milan, a great Enquirer of Truth, but too greedy a Receiver of it. He hath left many excellent Discourses, Medical, Natural, and Astrological; the most suspicious are those two he wrote by admonition in a dream, that is &quot;De Subtilitate &amp; Varietate Rerum&quot;. Assuredly this learned man hath taken many things upon trust, and although examined some, hath let slip many others. He is of singular use unto a prudent Reader; but unto him that only desireth Hoties, or to replenish his head with varieties; like many others before related, either in the Original or confirmation, he may become no small occasion of Error.
Richard Hinckley Allen tells of an amusing reference made by Samuel Butler in his book &quot;Hudibras&quot;:

Alessandro Manzoni&#x27;s novel &quot;I Promessi Sposi&quot; portrays a pedantic scholar of the obsolete, Don Ferrante, as a great admirer of Cardano. Significantly, he values him only for his superstitious and astrological writings; his scientific writings are dismissed because they contradict Aristotle, but excused on the ground that the author of the astrological works deserves to be listened to even when he is wrong.

English novelist E. M. Forster&#x27;s &quot;Abinger Harvest&quot;, a 1936 volume of essays, authorial reviews and a play, provides a sympathetic treatment of Cardano in the section titled &#x27;The Past&#x27;. Forster believes Cardano was so absorbed in &quot;self-analysis that he often forgot to repent of his bad temper, his stupidity, his licentiousness, and love of revenge&quot; (212).

<text>Gabbro ( ) is a phaneritic (coarse-grained and magnesium- and iron-rich), mafic intrusive igneous rock formed from the slow cooling magma into a holocrystalline mass deep beneath the Earth&#x27;s surface. Slow-cooling, coarse-grained gabbro is chemically equivalent to rapid-cooling, fine-grained basalt. Much of the Earth&#x27;s oceanic crust is made of gabbro, formed at mid-ocean ridges. Gabbro is also found as plutons associated with continental volcanism. Due to its variant nature, the term &quot;gabbro&quot; may be applied loosely to a wide range of intrusive rocks, many of which are merely &quot;gabbroic&quot;. By rough analogy, gabbro is to basalt as granite is to rhyolite.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;gabbro&quot; was used in the 1760s to name a set of rock types that were found in the ophiolites of the Apennine Mountains in Italy. It was named after Gabbro, a hamlet near Rosignano Marittimo in Tuscany. Then, in 1809, the German geologist Christian Leopold von Buch used the term more restrictively in his description of these Italian ophiolitic rocks. He assigned the name &quot;gabbro&quot; to rocks that geologists nowadays would more strictly call &quot;metagabbro&quot; (metamorphosed gabbro).

==Petrology==
Gabbro is a coarse-grained (phaneritic) igneous rock that is relatively low in silica and rich in iron, magnesium, and calcium. Such rock is described as &quot;mafic&quot;. Gabbro is composed of pyroxene (mostly clinopyroxene) and calcium-rich plagioclase, with minor amounts of hornblende, olivine, orthopyroxene and accessory minerals. With significant (&gt;10%) olivine or orthopyroxene it is classified as olivine gabbro or gabbronorite respectively. Where present, hornblende is typically found as a rim around augite crystals or as large grains enclosing smaller grains of other minerals (&quot;poikilitic&quot; grains).


Geologists use rigorous quantitative definitions to classify coarse-grained igneous rocks, based on the mineral content of the rock. For igneous rocks composed mostly of silicate minerals, and in which at least 10% of the mineral content consists of quartz, feldspar, or feldspathoid minerals, classification begins with the QAPF diagram. The relative abundances of quartz (Q), alkali feldspar (A), plagioclase (P), and feldspathoid (F), are used to plot the position of the rock on the diagram. The rock will be classified as either a gabbroid or a dioritoid if quartz makes up less than 20% of the QAPF content, feldspathoid makes up less than 10% of the QAPF content, and plagioclase makes up more than 65% of the total feldspar content. Gabbroids are distinguished from dioritoids by an anorthite (calcium plagioclase) fraction of their total plagioclase of greater than 50%.

The composition of the plagioclase cannot easily be determined in the field, and then a preliminary distinction is made between dioritoid and gabbroid based on the content of mafic minerals. A gabbroid typically has over 35% mafic minerals, mostly pyroxenes or olivine, while a dioritoid typically has less than 35% mafic minerals, which typically includes hornblende.

Gabbroids form a family of rock types similar to gabbro, such as monzogabbro, quartz gabbro, or nepheline-bearing gabbro. Gabbro itself is more narrowly defined, as a gabbroid in which quartz makes up less than 5% of the QAPF content, feldspathoids are not present, and plagioclase makes up more than 90% of the feldspar content. Gabbro is distinct from anorthosite, which contains less than 10% mafic minerals.

Coarse-grained gabbroids are produced by slow crystallization of magma having the same composition as the lava that solidifies rapidly to form fine-grained (aphanitic) basalt.

=== Subtypes ===
There are a number of subtypes of gabbro recognized by geologists. Gabbros can be broadly divided into leucogabbros, with less than 35% mafic mineral content; mesogabbros, with 35% to 65% mafic mineral content; and melagabbros with more than 65% mafic mineral content. A rock with over 90% mafic mineral content will be classified instead as an ultramafic rock. A gabbroic rock with less than 10% mafic mineral content will be classified as an anorthosite.

A more detailed classification is based on the relative percentages of plagioclase, pyroxene, hornblende, and olivine. The end members are:
* Normal gabbro (gabbro &quot;sensu stricto&quot;) is composed almost entirely of plagioclase and clinopyroxene (typically augite), with less than 5% each of hornblende, olivine, or orthopyroxene. 
* Norite is composed almost entirely of plagioclase and orthopyroxene, with less than 5% each of hornblende, clinopyroxene, or olivine.
* Troctolite is composed almost entirely of plagioclase and olivine, with less than 5% each of pyroxene or hornblende.
* Hornblende gabbro is composed almost entirely of plagioclase and hornblende, with less than 5% each of pyroxene or olivine.
Gabbros intermediate between these compositions are given names such as gabbronorite (for a gabbro intermediate between normal gabbro and norite, with almost equal amounts of clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene) or olivine gabbro (for a gabbro containing significant olivine, but almost no clinopyroxene or hornblende). A rock similar to normal gabbro but containing more orthopyroxene is called an orthopyroxene gabbro, while a rock similar to norite but containing more clinopyroxene is called a clinopyroxene norite.


Gabbros are also sometimes classified as alkali or tholleiitic gabbros, by analogy with alkali or tholeiitic basalts, of which they are considered the intrusive equivalents. Alkali gabbro usually contains olivine, nepheline, or analcime, up to 10% of the mineral content, while tholeiitic gabbro contains both clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene, making it a gabbronorite.

=== Gabbroids ===
Gabbroids (also known as gabbroic-rocks) are a family of coarse-grained igneous rocks similar to gabbro:
* Quartz gabbro contains 5% to 20% quartz in its QAPF fraction. One example is the &quot;cizlakite&quot; at Pohorje in northeastern Slovenia,
* Monzogabbro contains 65% to 90% plagioclase out of its total feldspar content.
* Quartz monzogabbro combines the features of quartz gabbro and monzogabbro. It contains 5% to 20% quartz in its QAPF fraction, and 65% to 90% of its feldspar is plagioclase.
* Foid-bearing gabbro contains up to 10% feldspathoids rather than quartz. &quot;Foid&quot; in the name is usually replaced by the specific feldspathoid that is most abundant in the rock. For example, a nepheline-bearing gabbro is a foid-bearing gabbro in which the most abundant feldspathoid is nepheline.
* Foid-bearing monzogabbro resembles monzogabbro, but containing up to 10% feldspathoids in place of quartz. The same naming conventions apply as for foid-bearing gabbro, so that a gabbroid might be classified as a leucite-bearing monzogabbro.

Gabbroids contain minor amounts, typically a few percent, of iron-titanium oxides such as magnetite, ilmenite, and ulvospinel. Apatite, zircon, and biotite may also be present as accessory minerals.

Gabbro is generally coarse-grained, with crystals in the size range of 1 mm or larger. Finer-grained equivalents of gabbro are called diabase (also known as dolerite), although the term &quot;microgabbro&quot; is often used when extra descriptiveness is desired. Gabbro may be extremely coarse-grained to pegmatitic. Some pyroxene-plagioclase cumulates are essentially coarse-grained gabbro, and may exhibit acicular crystal habits.

Gabbro is usually equigranular in texture, although it may also show ophitic texture (with laths of plagioclase enclosed in pyroxene).

==Distribution==
Nearly all gabbros are found in plutonic bodies, and the term (as the International Union of Geological Sciences recommends) is normally restricted just to plutonic rocks, although gabbro may be found as a coarse-grained interior facies of certain thick lavas. Gabbro can be formed as a massive, uniform intrusion via in-situ crystallisation of pyroxene and plagioclase, or as part of a layered intrusion as a cumulate formed by settling of pyroxene and plagioclase. 
An alternative name for gabbros formed by crystal settling is &quot;pyroxene-plagioclase adcumulate&quot;.

Gabbro is much less common than more silica-rich intrusive rocks in the continental crust of the Earth. Gabbro and gabbroids occur in some batholiths but these rocks are relatively minor components of these very large intrusions because their iron and calcium content usually makes gabbro and gabbroid magmas too dense to have the necessary buoyancy. However, gabbro is an essential part of the oceanic crust, and can be found in many ophiolite complexes as layered gabbro underling sheeted dike complexes and overlying ultramafic rock derived from the Earth&#x27;s mantle. These layered gabbros may have formed from relatively small but long-lived magma chambers underlying mid-ocean ridges.

Layered gabbros are also characteristic of lopoliths, which are large, saucer-shaped intrusions that are primarily Precambrian in age. Prominent examples of lopoliths include the Bushveld Complex of South Africa, the Muskox intrusion of the Northwest Territories of Canada, the Rum layered intrusion of Scotland, the Stillwater complex of Montana, and the layered gabbros near Stavanger, Norway. Gabbros are also present in stocks associated with alkaline volcanism of continental rifting.

==Uses==
Gabbro often contains valuable amounts of chromium, nickel, cobalt, gold, silver, platinum, and copper sulfides. For example, the Merensky Reef is the world&#x27;s most important source of platinum.

Gabbro is known in the construction industry by the trade name of &quot;black granite&quot;. However, gabbro is hard and difficult to work, which limits its use.

The term &quot;indigo gabbro&quot; is used as a common name for a mineralogically complex rock type often found in mottled tones of black and lilac-grey. It is mined in central Madagascar for use as a semi-precious stone. Indigo Gabbro can contain numerous minerals, including quartz and feldspar. Reports state that the dark matrix of the rock is composed of a mafic igneous rock, but whether this is basalt or gabbro is unclear.

<text>Eugene Wesley Roddenberry Sr. (August 19, 1921 – October 24, 1991) was an American television screenwriter and producer who created the science fiction series and fictional universe &quot;Star Trek.&quot; Born in El Paso, Texas, Roddenberry grew up in Los Angeles, where his father was a police officer. Roddenberry flew 89 combat missions in the Army Air Forces during World War II and worked as a commercial pilot after the war. Later, he joined the Los Angeles Police Department and began to write for television.

As a freelance writer, Roddenberry wrote scripts for &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;, &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, and other series, before creating and producing his own television series, &quot;The Lieutenant.&quot; In 1964, Roddenberry created the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, which premiered in 1966 and ran for three seasons. He then worked on projects including a string of failed television pilots. The syndication of &quot;Star Trek&quot; led to its growing popularity, resulting in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; feature films, which Roddenberry continued to produce and consult on. In 1987, the sequel series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; began airing on television in first-run syndication; Roddenberry was involved in the initial development but took a less active role after the first season due to ill health. He consulted on the series until his death in 1991.

In 1985, Roddenberry became the first TV writer with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He was later inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame and the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame. Years after his death, Roddenberry was one of the first humans to have their ashes carried into earth orbit. &quot;Star Trek&quot; has inspired films, books, comic books, video games and fan films set in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

==Early life and career==
Gene Roddenberry was born on August 19, 1921, in his parents&#x27; rented home in El Paso, Texas, the first child of Eugene Edward Roddenberry and Caroline &quot;Glen&quot; () Roddenberry. The family moved to Los Angeles in 1923 after Gene&#x27;s father passed the civil service test and was given a police commission there. During his childhood, Roddenberry was interested in reading, especially pulp magazines, and was a fan of stories such as &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot;, &quot;Tarzan&quot;, and the &quot;Skylark&quot; series by E. E. Smith.

Roddenberry majored in police science at Los Angeles City College, where he began dating Eileen-Anita Rexroat and became interested in aeronautical engineering. He obtained a pilot&#x27;s license through the United States Army Air Corps-sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program. He enlisted with the USAAC on December 18, 1941 and married Eileen on June 13, 1942. He graduated from the USAAC on August 5, 1942, when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant.

He was posted to Bellows Field, Oahu, to join the 394th Bomb Squadron, 5th Bombardment Group, of the Thirteenth Air Force, which flew the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress.

On August 2, 1943, while flying B-17E-BO, &quot;41-2463&quot;, &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;, out of Espiritu Santo, the plane Roddenberry was piloting overran the runway by and crashed into trees, crushing the nose and starting a fire as well as killing two men: bombardier Sgt. John P. Kruger and navigator Lt. Talbert H. Woolam. The official report absolved Roddenberry of any responsibility. Roddenberry spent the remainder of his military career in the United States and flew all over the country as a plane crash investigator. He was involved in a second plane crash, this time as a passenger. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal.

In 1945, Roddenberry began flying for Pan American World Airways, including routes from New York to Johannesburg or Calcutta, the two longest Pan Am routes at the time. Listed as a resident of River Edge, New Jersey, he experienced his third crash while on the Clipper &quot;Eclipse&quot; on June 18, 1947. The plane came down in the Syrian Desert, and Roddenberry, who took control as the ranking flight officer, suffered two broken ribs but was able to drag injured passengers out of the burning plane and led the group to get help. Fourteen (or fifteen) people died in the crash; eleven passengers required hospital treatment (including Bishnu Charan Ghosh), and eight were unharmed. Roddenberry resigned from Pan Am on May 15, 1948, and decided to pursue his dream of writing, particularly for the new medium of television.

Roddenberry applied for a position with the Los Angeles Police Department on January 10, 1949, and spent his first sixteen months in the traffic division before being transferred to the newspaper unit. That became the Public Information Division, and Roddenberry became the Chief of Police&#x27;s speech writer. In this position, he also became the LAPD liaison to the very popular &quot;Dragnet&quot; television series, providing technical advisors for specific episodes. He also did his first TV writing for the show, taking actual cases, and boiling them down to short screen treatments that would be fleshed out into full scripts by Jack Webb&#x27;s staff of writers, and splitting the fee with the officers who actually investigated the real-life case. He became then technical advisor for a new television version of &quot;Mr. District Attorney&quot;, which led to him writing for the show under his pseudonym &quot;Robert Wesley&quot;. He began to collaborate with Ziv Television Programs and continued to sell scripts to &quot;Mr. District Attorney&quot;, in addition to Ziv&#x27;s &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;. In early 1956, he sold two story ideas for &quot;I Led Three Lives&quot;, and he found that it was becoming increasingly difficult to be a writer and a policeman. On June 7, 1956, he resigned from the force to concentrate on his writing career.

==Career as full-time writer and producer==
===Early career===
Roddenberry was promoted to head writer for &quot;The West Point Story&quot; and wrote ten scripts for the first season, about a third of the total episodes. While working for Ziv, in 1956, he pitched a series to CBS set aboard a cruise ship, &quot;Hawaii Passage&quot;, but they did not buy it, as he wanted to become a producer and have full creative control. He wrote another script for Ziv&#x27;s series &quot;Harbourmaster&quot; titled &quot;Coastal Security&quot; and signed a contract with the company to develop a show called &quot;Junior Executive&quot; with Quinn Martin. Nothing came of the series.

He wrote scripts for a number of other series in his early years as a professional writer, including &quot;The Jane Wyman Show&quot;, &quot;Bat Masterson&quot; and &quot;Jefferson Drum&quot;. Roddenberry&#x27;s episode of the series &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, &quot;Helen of Abajinian&quot;, won the Writers Guild of America award for Best Teleplay in 1958. He also continued to create series of his own, including a series based on an agent for Lloyd&#x27;s of London called &quot;The Man from Lloyds&quot;. He pitched a police-based series called &quot;Footbeat&quot; to CBS, Hollis Productions, and Screen Gems. It nearly made it into ABC&#x27;s Sunday-night lineup, but they opted to show only Western series that night.

Roddenberry was asked to write a series called &quot;Riverboat&quot;, set in 1860s Mississippi. When he discovered that the producers wanted no black people on the show, he argued so much with them that he lost the job. He also considered moving to England around this time, as Lew Grade wanted Roddenberry to develop series and set up his own production company. Though he did not move, he leveraged the deal to land a contract with Screen Gems that included a guaranteed $100,000, and became a producer for the first time on a summer replacement for &quot;The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show&quot; titled &quot;Wrangler&quot;.

Screen Gems backed Roddenberry&#x27;s first attempt at creating a pilot. His series, &quot;The Wild Blue&quot;, went to pilot, but was not picked up. The three main characters had names that later appeared in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series: Philip Pike, Edward Jellicoe, and James T. Irvine. While working at Screen Gems, an actress, new to Hollywood, wrote to him asking for a meeting. They quickly became friends and met every few months; the woman was Majel Leigh Hudec, later known as Majel Barrett. He created a second pilot called &quot;333 Montgomery&quot; about a lawyer, played by DeForest Kelley. It was not picked up by the network but was later rewritten as a new series called &quot;Defiance County&quot;. His career with Screen Gems ended in late 1961, and shortly afterward, he had issues with his old friend Erle Stanley Gardner. The &quot;Perry Mason&quot; creator claimed that &quot;Defiance County&quot; had infringed his character Doug Selby. The two writers fell out via correspondence and stopped contacting one another, though &quot;Defiance County&quot; never proceeded past the pilot stage. The project finally wound up as the NBC series &quot;Sam Benedict&quot; with Edmond O&#x27;Brien in the title role, produced by MGM. E. Jack Neuman took the creator&#x27;s credit; claiming the character was based on real-life San Francisco lawyer Jake Ehrlich.

In 1961, he agreed to appear in an advertisement for MONY (Mutual of New York) as long as he had final approval. With the money from Screen Gems and other works, he and Eileen moved to 539 South Beverly Glen, near Beverly Hills. He discussed an idea about a multi-ethnic crew on an airship traveling the world, based on the film &quot;Master of the World&quot; (1961), with fellow writer Christopher Knopf at MGM. As the time was not right for science fiction, he began work on &quot;The Lieutenant&quot; for Arena Productions. This made it to the NBC Saturday night lineup at 7:30 pm and premiered on September 14, 1963. The show set a new ratings record for the time slot. Roddenberry worked with several cast and crew who would later join him on &quot;Star Trek&quot;, including Gene L. Coon, star Gary Lockwood, Joe D&#x27;Agosta, Leonard Nimoy, Nichelle Nichols, and Majel Barrett.

&quot;The Lieutenant&quot; was produced with the co-operation of the Pentagon, which allowed them to film at an actual Marine base. During the production of the series Roddenberry clashed regularly with the Department of Defense over potential plots. The department withdrew its support after Roddenberry pressed ahead with a plot titled &quot;To Set It Right&quot; in which a white and a black man find a common cause in their roles as Marines. &quot;To Set It Right&quot; was the first time he worked with Nichols, and it was her first television role. The episode has been preserved at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York City. The show was not renewed after its first season. Roddenberry was already working on a new series idea. This included his ship location from &quot;Hawaii Passage&quot; and added a Horatio Hornblower character, plus the multiracial crew from his airship idea. He decided to write it as science fiction, and by March 11, 1964, he brought together a 16-page pitch. On April 24, he sent three copies and two dollars to the Writers Guild of America to register his series. He called it &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===

When Roddenberry pitched &quot;Star Trek&quot; to MGM, it was warmly received, but no offer was made. He then went to Desilu Productions, but rather than being offered a one-script deal, he was hired as a producer and allowed to work on his own projects. His first was a half-hour pilot called &quot;Police Story&quot; (not to be confused with the anthology series created by Joseph Wambaugh), which was not picked up by the networks. Having not sold a pilot in five years, Desilu was having financial difficulties; its only success was &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. Roddenberry took the &quot;Star Trek&quot; idea to Oscar Katz, head of programming, and the duo immediately started work on a plan to sell the series to the networks. They took it to CBS, which ultimately passed on it. The duo later learned that CBS had been eager to find out about &quot;Star Trek&quot; because it had a science fiction series in development—&quot;Lost in Space&quot;. Roddenberry and Katz next took the idea to Mort Werner at NBC, this time downplaying the science fiction elements and highlighting the links to &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and &quot;Wagon Train.&quot; The network funded three story ideas and selected &quot;The Menagerie&quot;, which was later known as &quot;The Cage&quot;, to be made into a pilot. (The other two later became episodes of the series.) While most of the money for the pilot came from NBC, the remaining costs were covered by Desilu. Roddenberry hired Dorothy Fontana, better known as D. C. Fontana, as his assistant. They had worked together previously on &quot;The Lieutenant,&quot; and she had eight script credits to her name.
Roddenberry and Barrett had begun an affair by the early days of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and he specifically wrote the part of the character Number One in the pilot with her in mind; no other actresses were considered for the role. Barrett suggested Nimoy for the part of Spock. He had worked with both Roddenberry and Barrett on &quot;The Lieutenant&quot;, and once Roddenberry remembered the thin features of the actor, he did not consider anyone else for the part. The remaining cast came together; filming began on November 27, 1964, and was completed on December 11. After post-production, the episode was shown to NBC executives, and it was rumored that &quot;Star Trek&quot; would be broadcast at 8:00 pm on Friday nights. The episode failed to impress test audiences, and after the executives became hesitant, Katz offered to make a second pilot. On March 26, 1965, NBC ordered a new episode.

Roddenberry developed several possible scripts, including &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Women&quot;, &quot;The Omega Glory&quot;, and with the help of Samuel A. Peeples, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;. NBC selected the last one, leading to later rumors that Peeples created &quot;Star Trek&quot;, something he always denied. Roddenberry was determined to make the crew racially diverse, which impressed actor George Takei when he came for his audition. The episode went into production on July 15, 1965, and was completed at around half the cost of &quot;The Cage&quot;, since the sets were already built. Roddenberry worked on several projects for the rest of the year. In December, he decided to write lyrics to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; theme; this angered the theme&#x27;s composer, Alexander Courage, as it meant that royalties would be split between them. In February 1966, NBC informed Desilu that they were buying &quot;Star Trek&quot; and that it would be included in the fall 1966 television schedule.

On May 24, the first episode of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series went into production; Desilu was contracted to deliver 13 episodes. Five days before the first broadcast, Roddenberry appeared at the 24th World Science Fiction Convention and previewed &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;. After the episode was shown, he received a standing ovation. The first episode to air on NBC was &quot;The Man Trap&quot;, on September 8, 1966, at 8:00 pm. Roddenberry was immediately concerned about the series&#x27; low ratings and wrote to Harlan Ellison to ask if he could use his name in letters to the network to save the show. Not wanting to lose a potential source of income, Ellison agreed and also sought the help of other writers who also wanted to avoid losing potential income. Roddenberry corresponded with science fiction writer Isaac Asimov about how to address the issue of Spock&#x27;s growing popularity and the possibility that his character would overshadow Kirk. Asimov suggested having Kirk and Spock work together as a team &quot;to get people to think of Kirk when they think of Spock.&quot; The series was renewed by NBC, first for a full season&#x27;s order, and then for a second season. An article in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; quoted studio executives as stating that the letter-writing campaign had been wasted because they had already been planning to renew &quot;Star Trek&quot;.
Roddenberry often rewrote submitted scripts, although he did not always take credit for these. Roddenberry and Ellison fell out over &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; after Roddenberry rewrote Ellison&#x27;s script to make it both financially feasible to film and usable for the series context. Even his close friend Don Ingalls had his script for &quot;A Private Little War&quot; altered drastically, and as a result, Ingalls declared that he would only be credited under the pseudonym &quot;Jud Crucis&quot; (a play on &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;), claiming he had been crucified by the process. Roddenberry&#x27;s work rewriting &quot;The Menagerie&quot;, based on footage originally shot for &quot;The Cage&quot;, resulted in a Writers Guild arbitration board hearing. The Guild ruled in his favor over John D. F. Black, the complainant. The script won a Hugo Award, but the awards board neglected to inform Roddenberry, who found out through correspondence with Asimov.

As the second season was drawing to a close, Roddenberry once again faced the threat of cancellation. He enlisted the help of Asimov, and even encouraged a student-led protest march on NBC. On January 8, 1968, a thousand students from 20 schools marched on the studio. Roddenberry began to communicate with &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan Bjo Trimble, who led a fan-writing campaign to save the series. Trimble later noted that this campaign of writing to fans who had written to Desilu about the show, urging them to write NBC, had created an organized &quot;Star Trek&quot; fandom. The network received around 6,000 letters a week from fans petitioning it to renew the series. On March 1, 1968, NBC announced on air, at the end of &quot;The Omega Glory&quot;, that &quot;Star Trek&quot; would return for a third season.

The network had initially planned to place &quot;Star Trek&quot; in the 7:30 pm Monday-night time slot freed up by &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; completing its run. That would have meant &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; had to start a half-hour later (moving from 9:00 to 9:30). Powerful &quot;Laugh-In&quot; producer George Schlatter objected to his highly rated show yielding its slot to the poorly-rated &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Instead, &quot;Laugh-In&quot; retained the slot, and &quot;Star Trek&quot; was moved to 10:00 pm on Fridays. Realizing the show could not survive in that time slot and burned out from arguments with the network, Roddenberry resigned from the day-to-day running of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, although he continued to be credited as executive producer. Roddenberry cooperated with Stephen Edward Poe, writing as Stephen Whitfield, on the 1968 non-fiction book &quot;The Making of Star Trek&quot; for Ballantine Books, splitting the royalties evenly. Roddenberry explained to Whitfield: &quot;I had to get some money somewhere. I&#x27;m sure not going to get it from the profits of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.&quot; Herbert Solow and Robert H. Justman observed that Whitfield never regretted his 50–50 deal with Roddenberry, since it gave him &quot;the opportunity to become the first chronicler of television&#x27;s successful unsuccessful series.&quot; Whitfield had previously been the national advertising and promotion director for model makers Aluminum Model Toys, better known as &quot;AMT&quot;, which then held the &quot;Star Trek&quot; license, and moved to run Lincoln Enterprises, Roddenberry&#x27;s company set up to sell the series&#x27; merchandise.

Having stepped aside from the majority of his &quot;Star Trek&quot; duties, Roddenberry sought instead to create a film based on Asimov&#x27;s &quot;I, Robot&quot; and also began work on a &quot;Tarzan&quot; script for National General Pictures. After initially requesting a budget of $2 million and being refused, Roddenberry made cuts to reduce costs to $1.2 million. When he learned they were being offered only $700,000 to shoot the film, which by now was being called a TV movie, he canceled the deal. NBC announced &quot;Star Trek&quot; cancellation in February 1969. A similar but much smaller letter-writing campaign followed news of the cancellation. Because of the manner in which the series was sold to NBC, it left the production company $4.7 million in debt. The last episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; aired 47 days before Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon as part of the Apollo 11 mission, and Roddenberry declared that he would never write for television again.

===1970s projects===

After the cancellation of &quot;Star Trek,&quot; Roddenberry felt typecast as a producer of science fiction, despite his background in Westerns and police stories. He later described the period, saying, &quot;My dreams were going downhill because I could not get work after the original series was cancelled.&quot; He felt that he was &quot;perceived as the guy who made the show that was an expensive flop.&quot; Roddenberry had sold his interest in &quot;Star Trek&quot; to Paramount Studios in return for a third of the profits but this did not result in any quick financial gain; the studio was still claiming that the series was $500,000 in the red in 1982.

He wrote and produced &quot;Pretty Maids All in a Row&quot; (1971), a sexploitation film directed by Roger Vadim, for MGM. The cast included Rock Hudson, Angie Dickinson, Telly Savalas, and Roddy McDowall alongside &quot;Star Trek&quot; regular James Doohan and notable guest star William Campbell, who had appeared in &quot;The Squire Of Gothos&quot; and &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; was unimpressed: &quot;Whatever substance was in the original [novel by Francis Pollini] or screen concept has been plowed under, leaving only superficial, one-joke results.&quot; Herbert Solow had given Roddenberry the work as a favor, paying him $100,000 for the script.
Faced with a mortgage and a $2,000-per-month alimony obligation as a result of his 1969 divorce, he retained a booking agent (with the assistance of his friend Arthur C. Clarke) and began to support himself largely by scheduling appearances at colleges and science fiction conventions. These presentations typically included screenings of &quot;The Cage&quot; and blooper reels from the production of &quot;Star Trek.&quot; The conventions began to build the fan support to bring back &quot;Star Trek,&quot; leading &quot;TV Guide&quot; to describe it, in 1972, as &quot;the show that won&#x27;t die.&quot;

In 1972 and 1973, Roddenberry made a comeback to science fiction, selling ideas for four new series to a variety of networks. Roddenberry&#x27;s &quot;Genesis II&quot; was set in a post-apocalyptic Earth. He had hoped to recreate the success of &quot;Star Trek&quot; without &quot;doing another space-hopping show.&quot; He created a 45-page writing guide, and proposed several story ideas based on the concept that pockets of civilisation had regressed to past eras or changed altogether. The pilot aired as a TV movie in March 1973, setting new records for the &quot;Thursday Night Movie of the Week&quot;. Roddenberry was asked to produce four more scripts for episodes, but before production could begin again, CBS aired the film &quot;Planet of the Apes.&quot; It was watched by an even greater audience than &quot;Genesis II.&quot; CBS scrapped &quot;Genesis II&quot; and replaced it with a television series based on the film; the results were disastrous from a ratings standpoint, and &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; was canceled after 14 episodes.

&quot;The Questor Tapes&quot; project reunited him with his &quot;Star Trek&quot; collaborator, Gene L. Coon, who was in poor health. NBC ordered 16 episodes, and tentatively scheduled the series to follow &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; on Friday nights; the pilot launched on January 23, 1974, to positive critical response, but Roddenberry balked at the substantial changes requested by the network and left the project, leading to its immediate cancellation. During 1974, Roddenberry reworked the &quot;Genesis II&quot; concept as a second pilot, &quot;Planet Earth,&quot; for rival network ABC, with similar less-than-successful results. The pilot was aired on April 23, 1974. While Roddenberry wanted to create something that could feasibly exist in the future, the network wanted stereotypical science-fiction women and were unhappy when that was not delivered. Roddenberry was not involved in a third reworking of the material by ABC that produced &quot;Strange New World.&quot; He began developing &quot;MAGNA I,&quot; an underwater science-fiction series, for 20th Century Fox Television. By the time the work on the script was complete, though, those who had approved the project had left Fox and their replacements were not interested in the project. A similar fate was faced by &quot;Tribunes,&quot; a science-fiction police series, which Roddenberry attempted to get off the ground between 1973 and 1977. He gave up after four years; the series never even reached the pilot stage.

In 1974, Roddenberry was paid $25,000 by John Whitmore to write a script called &quot;The Nine&quot;. Intended to be about Andrija Puharich&#x27;s parapsychological research, it evolved into a frank exploration of his experiences attempting to earn a living attending science fiction conventions. At the time, he was again close to losing his house because of a lack of income. The pilot &quot;Spectre,&quot; Roddenberry&#x27;s 1977 attempt to create an occult detective duo similar to Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, was released as a television movie within the United States and received a limited theatrical release in the United Kingdom.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot; revival===

Lacking funds in the early 1970s, Roddenberry was unable to buy the full rights to &quot;Star Trek&quot; for $150,000 ($ million in ) from Paramount. Lou Scheimer approached Paramount in 1973 about creating an animated &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. Credited as &quot;executive consultant&quot; and paid $2,500 per episode, Roddenberry was granted full creative control of &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;. Although he read all the scripts and &quot;sometimes [added] touches of his own&quot;, he relinquished most of his authority to &quot;de facto&quot; showrunner/associate producer D. C. Fontana.

Roddenberry had some difficulties with the cast. To save money, he sought not to hire George Takei and Nichelle Nichols. He neglected to inform Leonard Nimoy of this and instead, to get him to sign on, told him that he was the only member of the main cast not returning. After Nimoy discovered the deception, he demanded that Takei and Nichols play Sulu and Uhura when their characters appeared on screen; Roddenberry acquiesced. He had been promised five full seasons of the new show but ultimately, only one and a half were produced.

Vociferous fan support (6,000 attended the second New York &quot;Star Trek&quot; convention in 1973 and 15,000 attended in 1974, eclipsing the more established array of approximately 3,600 fans and industry professionals who attended the 32nd World Science Fiction Convention in Washington, D.C. in 1974) led Paramount to hire Roddenberry to create and produce a feature film based on the franchise in May 1975. The studio was unimpressed with the ideas being put forward; John D. F. Black&#x27;s opinion was that their ideas were never &quot;big enough&quot; for the studio, even when one scenario involved the end of the universe. Several ideas were partly developed including &quot;Star Trek: The God Thing&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Planet of the Titans&quot;. Following the commercial reception of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, in June 1977, Paramount instead green-lit a new series set in the franchise titled &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot;, with Roddenberry and most of the original cast, except Nimoy, set to reprise their respective roles.

It was to be the anchor show of a proposed Paramount-owned &quot;fourth network&quot;, but plans for the network were scrapped and the project was reworked into a feature film. The result, &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, troubled the studio because of budgetary concerns, but it was a box-office hit. Adjusted for inflation, it was the third-highest-grossing &quot;Star Trek&quot; movie, with the 2009 film coming in first and the 2013 film second.

In 1980, Roddenberry submitted a treatment for a proposed sequel about the crew preventing the alien Klingons from thwarting the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Mindful of the tumult that suffused the production of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, Paramount rejected the proposal. After he was replaced on the project by television producer Harve Bennett, Roddenberry was named &quot;executive consultant&quot; for the project, a position he retained for subsequent Star Trek franchise films produced during his lifetime. Under this arrangement, he was compensated with a producer&#x27;s fee and a percentage of the net profits of the film in exchange for proffering non-binding story notes and corresponding with the fan community; much to his chagrin, these memos were largely disregarded by Bennett and other producers. An initial script for &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; was circulated to eight people; Bennett attributed the subsequent plot leak of the death of Spock to Roddenberry. About 20% of the plot was based on Roddenberry&#x27;s ideas.

Roddenberry was involved in creating the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, which premiered with &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; on September 28, 1987. He was given a bonus of $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in addition to a salary to produce the series, and celebrated by purchasing a new Rolls-Royce for $100,000. The arrangement did not entitle him to be executive producer of the series. Paramount was already concerned about the original cast not returning, and fearing fan reaction if Roddenberry was not involved, agreed to his demand for control of the show. Roddenberry rewrote the series bible from an original version by David Gerrold, who had previously written &quot;The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;, and &quot;The Animated Series&quot; follow-up, &quot;More Tribbles, More Troubles&quot;.
According to producer Rick Berman, Roddenberry&#x27;s involvement in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; &quot;diminished greatly&quot; after the first season, but the nature of his increasingly peripheral role was not disclosed because of the value of his name to fans. While Berman said that Roddenberry had &quot;all but stopped writing and rewriting&quot; by the end of the third season, his final writing credit on the show (a co-teleplay credit) actually occurred considerably earlier, appearing on &quot;Datalore&quot;, the 13th episode of the first season.

Although commercially successful from its inception, the series was initially marred by Writers Guild of America grievances from Fontana and Gerrold, both of whom left the series in acrimonious circumstances; frequent turnover among the writing staff (24 staff writers left the show during its first three seasons, triple the average attrition rate for such series); and allegations that Roddenberry attorney Leonard Maizlish had become the producer&#x27;s &quot;point man and proxy&quot;, ghostwriting memos, sitting in on meetings, and contributing to scripts despite not being on staff. Writer Tracy Tormé described the first few seasons of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; under Roddenberry as an &quot;insane asylum&quot;.

In 1990, Nicholas Meyer was brought in to direct the sixth film in the series: &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;. Creatively, Meyer clashed with Roddenberry, who felt that having the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer described a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying

His guys were lined up on one side of the room, and my guys were lined up on the other side of the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt I&#x27;d behaved very well, very diplomatically. I came out of it feeling not very good, and I&#x27;ve not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because at the end of the day, I was going to go out and make the movie. I didn&#x27;t have to take him on. Not my finest hour.

In Joel Engel&#x27;s biography, &quot;Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek&quot;, he states that Roddenberry watched &quot;The Undiscovered Country&quot; alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a &quot;good job&quot;. In contrast, Nimoy and Shatner&#x27;s memoirs report that after the screening, Roddenberry called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused.

Roddenberry wrote the novelization of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;. Although it has been incorrectly attributed to several other authors (most notably Alan Dean Foster), it was the first in a series of hundreds of &quot;Star Trek&quot;-based novels to be published by the Pocket Books imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster, whose parent company also owned Paramount Pictures Corporation. Previously, Roddenberry worked intermittently on &quot;The God Thing&quot;, a proposed novel based upon his rejected 1975 screenplay for a proposed low-budget ($3 to $5 million) &quot;Star Trek&quot; film preceding the development of &quot;Phase II&quot; throughout 1976. Attempts to complete the project by Walter Koenig, Susan Sackett, Fred Bronson, and Michael Jan Friedman have proven to be unfeasible for a variety of legal and structural reasons.

==Personal life==
While at Los Angeles City College, Roddenberry began dating Eileen-Anita Rexroat. They became engaged before Roddenberry left Los Angeles during his military service, and they married on June 20, 1942, at the chapel at Kelly Field. They had two daughters, Darleen Anita and Dawn Allison. During his time in the LAPD, Roddenberry was known to have had affairs with secretarial staff. Before his work on &quot;Star Trek&quot;, he began relationships with Nichelle Nichols and Majel Barrett. Nichols wrote about their relationship in her autobiography &quot;Beyond Uhura&quot; only after Roddenberry&#x27;s death. At the time, Roddenberry wanted to remain in an open relationship with both women, but Nichols, recognizing Barrett&#x27;s devotion to him, ended the affair as she did not want to be &quot;the other woman to the other woman&quot;.

Barrett and Roddenberry had an apartment together by the opening weeks of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. He had planned to divorce Eileen after the first season of the show, but when the show was renewed, he delayed doing so, fearing that he would not have enough time to deal with both the divorce and &quot;Star Trek&quot;. He moved out of the family home on August 9, 1968, two weeks after the marriage of his daughter Darleen. In 1969, while scouting locations in Japan for MGM for &quot;Pretty Maids All in a Row&quot;, he proposed to Barrett by telephone. They were married in a Shinto ceremony, as Roddenberry had considered it &quot;sacrilegious&quot; to have an American minister in Japan perform the ceremony. Roddenberry and Barrett had a son together, Eugene Jr., commonly and professionally known as Rod Roddenberry, in February 1974.

From 1975 until his death, Roddenberry maintained an extramarital relationship with his executive assistant, Susan Sackett.

===Religious views===
Roddenberry grew up a Southern Baptist; however, as an adult, he rejected religion, and considered himself a humanist. He began questioning religion around the age of 14, and came to the conclusion that it was &quot;nonsense&quot;. As a child, he served in the choir at his local church, but often substituted lyrics as he sang hymns. Early in his writing career, he received an award from the American Baptist Convention for &quot;skillfully writing Christian truth and the application of Christian principles into commercial, dramatic TV scripts&quot;. For several years, he corresponded with John M. Gunn of the National Council of Churches regarding the application of Christian teachings in television series. However, Gunn stopped replying after Roddenberry wrote in a letter: &quot;But you must understand that I am a complete pagan, and consume enormous amounts of bread, having found the Word more spice than nourishment, so I am interested in a statement couched in dollars and cents of what this means to the Roddenberry treasury.&quot;

Roddenberry said of Christianity, &quot;How can I take seriously a God-image that requires that I prostrate myself every seven days and praise it? That sounds to me like a very insecure personality.&quot; At one point, he worked a similar opinion, which was to have been stated by a Vulcan, into the plot for &quot;Star Trek: The God Thing&quot;. He had a similar disdain for Judaism. Despite working closely with Jewish writers and stars such as Shatner, Nimoy, and Koenig for the series, Nimoy said of Roddenberry, &quot;Gene was antisemitic, clearly,&quot; qualifying that Roddenberry was anti-religious, seeing Jews as a religious group, adding &quot;but I saw examples not only of [Roddenberry] practicing antisemitism, but of him being callous about other peoples&#x27; differences as well.” As with Christianity, Roddenberry similarly dismissed that there were any deliberately Jewish principles or allusions included in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, telling a journalist, &quot;You Jews have a lamentable habit of identifying those characteristics in a society that you deem positive and then taking credit for inventing them.”

Before his death, Roddenberry became close friends with philosopher Charles Musès, who said that Roddenberry&#x27;s views were &quot;a far cry from atheism&quot;. Roddenberry explained his position thus: &quot;It&#x27;s not true that I don&#x27;t believe in God. I believe in a kind of God. It&#x27;s just not other people&#x27;s God. I reject religion. I accept the notion of God.&quot; He had an ongoing interest in other people&#x27;s experiences with religion, and called Catholicism &quot;a very beautiful religion. An art form.&quot; However, he said that he dismissed all organized religions, saying that for the most part, they acted like a &quot;substitute brain... and a very malfunctioning one&quot;. Roddenberry was also critical of how the public looked at certain religions, noting that when the King David Hotel bombing took place in 1946, the American public accepted it as the action of freedom fighters, whereas a car bombing by a Muslim in Beirut is condemned as a terrorist act. While he agreed that both parties were wrong in their use of violence, he said that the actions of both were undertaken because of their strong religious beliefs.

According to Ronald D. Moore, Roddenberry &quot;felt very strongly that contemporary Earth religions would be gone by the 23rd century&quot;. Brannon Braga said that Roddenberry made it known to the writers of &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; that religion, superstition, and mystical thinking were not to be included. Even a mention of marriage in a script for an early episode of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; resulted in Roddenberry&#x27;s chastising the writers. Nicholas Meyer said that &quot;Star Trek&quot; had evolved &quot;into sort of a secular parallel to the Catholic Mass&quot;. Roddenberry compared the franchise to his own philosophy by saying: &quot;Understand that &quot;Star Trek&quot; is more than just my political philosophy, my racial philosophy, my overview on life and the human condition.&quot; He was awarded the 1991 Humanist Arts Award from the American Humanist Association.

==Decline in health and death==
In the late 1980s, it was likely that Roddenberry was afflicted by the first manifestations of cerebrovascular disease and encephalopathy as a result of his longstanding recreational use of legal and illicit drugs, including alcohol, methaqualone, methylphenidate, Dexamyl, and cocaine (which he had used regularly since the production of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;). Roddenberry also used cannabis for many years, although its cumulative impact on his health remains unclear. Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially amphetamines. The effects of these substances were compounded by deleterious interactions with diabetes, high blood pressure, and antidepressant prescriptions.

Roddenberry had a stroke at a family reunion in Tallahassee, Florida, in September 1989, His health declined further, ultimately requiring him to use a wheelchair. His right arm was paralyzed after another stroke in early October 1991, causing him ongoing pain as the muscles began to atrophy. It also caused problems with the sight in his right eye, and he found communicating in full sentences difficult. At 2:00 pm, on October 24, he attended an appointment with his doctor, Dr. Ronald Rich, in Santa Monica, California. He arrived in the building with his staff and began to travel up to the ninth floor in the elevator. As they reached the fifth floor, he began struggling to breathe and was wheeled into the doctor&#x27;s office, where he was reclined, and a nurse administered oxygen. Barrett was sent for. Upon her arrival, she held Roddenberry while encouraging him to breathe. He suffered cardiopulmonary arrest in the doctor&#x27;s office shortly afterwards. CPR was attempted with no effect, and paramedics arrived to take him across the road to the Santa Monica Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. He was 70 years old.

The funeral was arranged for November 1, with the public invited to the memorial service at the Hall of Liberty, within the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Hollywood Hills. It was a secular service; Roddenberry had been cremated before the event. More than 300 &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans attended and stood in the balcony section of the hall, while the invited guests were on the floor level. Nichelle Nichols sang twice during the ceremony, first &quot;Yesterday&quot;, and then a song she wrote herself titled &quot;Gene&quot;. Both songs had been requested by Barrett. Several people spoke at the memorial, including Ray Bradbury, Whoopi Goldberg, E. Jack Neuman, and Patrick Stewart. The ceremony was closed by two kilted pipers playing &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; as a recorded message by Roddenberry was broadcast. A four-plane flypast, in the missing man formation, followed some 30 minutes later. After his death, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; aired a two-part episode of season five, called &quot;Unification&quot;, which featured a dedication to Roddenberry.

Roddenberry&#x27;s will left the majority of his $30 million estate to Barrett in a trust. He also left money to his children and his first wife, Eileen. However, his daughter Dawn contested the will, on the grounds that Barrett had undue influence on her father. In a hearing held in 1993, the Los Angeles Superior Court ruled that improprieties existed in the management of the trust and removed Barrett as executor. In another decision, the court found that Roddenberry had hidden assets from &quot;Star Trek&quot; in the Norway Corporation to keep funds away from his first wife, and ordered the payment of 50% of those assets to Eileen, as well as punitive damages. In 1996, the California Court of Appeals ruled that the original will, which stated that anyone who contested it would be disinherited, would stand. As a result, Dawn lost $500,000 from the estate, as well as a share of the trust upon Barrett&#x27;s death. The appellate court also overturned the earlier decision to award Roddenberry&#x27;s first wife, Eileen, 50% of his assets. The judge called that decision one &quot;that should never have been&quot;.

===Spaceflight===
In 1992, some of Roddenberry&#x27;s ashes were flown into space, and returned to Earth, on the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; mission STS-52. On April 21, 1997, a Celestis spacecraft with of the cremated remains of Roddenberry, along with those of Timothy Leary, Gerard K. O&#x27;Neill and 21 other people, was launched into Earth orbit as part of the Minisat 01 mission aboard a Pegasus XL rocket from a location near the Canary Islands.

On May 20, 2002, the spacecraft&#x27;s orbit deteriorated and it disintegrated in the atmosphere. Another flight to launch more of his ashes into deep space, along with those of Barrett, who died in 2008, was initially planned to take place in 2009. Unlike previous flights, the intention was that the flight would not return burning up in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The payload would include the ashes of James Doohan in addition to the Roddenberrys&#x27; and several others and was scheduled to fly in 2016 on the Sunjammer solar sail experiment, but the project was canceled in 2014. Celestis rescheduled their launch for 2020, then later rescheduled for June 2022, the next available commercial mission to deep space. A sample of the couple&#x27;s cremated remains will be sealed into a specially made capsule designed to withstand space travel. A spacecraft will carry the capsule, along with digitized tributes from fans, on Celestis&#x27; &quot;Enterprise Flight&quot;. The flight will also contain the ashes of Nichelle Nichols and Douglas Trumbull. The Celestis &quot;Enterprise Flight&quot; was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on January 8, 2024.

==Legacy==

In 1985, Gene Roddenberry was the first television writer to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. When the Sci-Fi Channel was launched, the first broadcast was a dedication to two &quot;science fiction pioneers&quot;: Isaac Asimov and Roddenberry. The Roddenberry crater on Mars is named after him, as is the asteroid 4659 Roddenberry. Roddenberry and &quot;Star Trek&quot; have been cited as inspiration for other science fiction franchises, with George Lucas crediting the series for enabling &quot;Star Wars&quot; to be produced. J. Michael Straczynski, creator of the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; franchise, appreciated &quot;Star Trek&quot; amongst other science fiction series and &quot;what they had to say about who we are, and where we are going.&quot;

David Alexander collaborated with Roddenberry on a biography over two decades. Titled &quot;Star Trek Creator&quot;, it was published in 1995. Yvonne Fern&#x27;s book &quot;Gene Roddenberry: The Last Conversation&quot; detailed a series of conversations she had with Roddenberry over the last months of his life. In October 2002, a plaque was placed at Roddenberry&#x27;s birthplace in El Paso, Texas. The El Paso Independent School District named the 40-foot, 120-seat Roddenberry Planetarium in his honor. The planetarium was recently upgraded and relocated to northeast El Paso. The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Roddenberry in 2007, and the Television Academy Hall of Fame in January 2010.

Commemorating Roddenberry&#x27;s 100th birthday in August 2021, NASA used its Deep Space Network to transmit a 1976 recording of Roddenberry towards the direction of the star system 40 Eridani (the host of the fictional planet Vulcan). The signal will reach the star in early 2038.

In September 2023, a genus of spiders, &quot;Roddenberryus&quot;, was named after him. The two researchers stated thet he &quot;inspired generations of kids to pursue scientific careers&quot;.

===Posthumous television series===
&quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; was already in development when Roddenberry died. Berman said that while he never discussed the ideas for the series, he was given a blessing by Roddenberry to pursue it. Berman later said, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe the 24th century is going to be like Gene Roddenberry believed it to be, that people will be free from poverty and greed. But if you&#x27;re going to write and produce for &quot;Star Trek&quot;, you&#x27;ve got to buy into that.&quot; In early 1996, Majel Barret-Roddenberry uncovered scripts for a series called &quot;Battleground Earth&quot;. The project was sent to distributors by the Creative Artists Agency, and it was picked up by Tribune Entertainment, which set the budget at over $1 million per episode. The series was renamed &quot;&quot; before launch, and premiered in 1997, six years after Gene&#x27;s death; it ran for five seasons and 110 episodes until 2002.

Two further series ideas were developed from Roddenberry&#x27;s notes, &quot;Genesis II&quot; and &quot;Andromeda&quot;. After an initial order for two seasons, 110 episodes of &quot;Andromeda&quot; were aired over five seasons from 2000 to 2005. Tribune also worked on another Roddenberry series. Titled &quot;Starship&quot;; the production company aimed to launch it via the network route rather than into syndication. Rod Roddenberry, president of Roddenberry Productions, announced in 2010, at his father&#x27;s posthumous induction into the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame, that he was aiming to take &quot;The Questor Tapes&quot; to television. Rod was developing the series alongside Imagine Television. Rod would go on to create the two-hour television movie &quot;Trek Nation&quot; regarding the impact of his father&#x27;s work.

===Awards and nominations===

The majority of the awards and nominations received by Roddenberry throughout his career were related to &quot;Star Trek&quot;. He was credited for &quot;Star Trek&quot; during the nominations for two Emmy Awards, and won two Hugo Awards. One Hugo was a special award for the series, while another was for &quot;The Menagerie&quot;, the episode that used footage from the original unaired pilot for &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;The Cage&quot;. In addition, he was awarded the Brotherhood Award by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People for his work in the advancement of African American characters on television. &quot;Star Trek&quot;, ended in 1969; he was nominated for Hugo Awards for &quot;Genesis II&quot; and &quot;The Questor Tapes&quot;. in 1974 and 1975, respectively. After his death in 1991, he was posthumously awarded the Robert A. Heinlein Memorial Award by the National Space Society and The George Pal Memorial Award at the Saturn Awards, as well as the Exceptional Public Service Medal by NASA.

<text>Galaxy Quest is a 1999 American satirical science fiction comedy film directed by Dean Parisot and written by David Howard and Robert Gordon. It stars Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell, and Daryl Mitchell. A parody of and homage to science-fiction films and series, especially &quot;Star Trek&quot; and its fandom, the film depicts the cast of a fictional cult television series, &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;, who are drawn into a real interstellar conflict by aliens who think the series is a documentary.

&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; was a modest box office success and received positive reviews. It won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Nebula Award for Best Script, and was nominated for ten Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film and Best Director, Best Actress for Weaver, and Best Supporting Actor for Rickman; Allen won Best Actor.

&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; achieved cult status, especially from &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans for its affectionate parody. Several &quot;Star Trek&quot; cast and crew members praised the film. It was included in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;″s list of the Top 100+ Funniest Movies of All Time in 2012, and &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans voted it the seventh-best &quot;Star Trek&quot; film in 2013.

== Plot ==

The cast of the 1980s space-adventure series &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; attend fan conventions and make trivial promotional appearances. Though the series&#x27; former star, Jason Nesmith, thrives on the attention, his co-stars Gwen DeMarco, Alexander Dane, Fred Kwan, and Tommy Webber resent him and the states of their careers. At a convention, a group calling themselves Thermians approaches Jason for help. Thinking they want him for a promotional appearance, he agrees. The next morning, when they pick him up, a hungover Jason does not grasp that the Thermians are actual aliens who have transported him to a working re-creation of the &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; starship, the NSEA &quot;Protector&quot;. Jason believes he is on a set, and performs in character as he confronts the Thermians&#x27; enemy, Sarris, who demands the &quot;Omega 13&quot;, a secret super weapon with unknown capabilities mentioned in the show&#x27;s finale, but never used on screen. Giving perfunctory orders, Jason manages to temporarily defeat Sarris.

After the grateful Thermians transport him back to Earth, Jason realizes the experience was real and attempts to convince the other cast members. When the Thermian Laliari seeks Jason&#x27;s help again, the cast joins him, along with the convention emcee, Guy, who had played an ill-fated extra in one episode. Aboard the &quot;Protector&quot;, the cast learn that the Thermians, who possess no concept of fiction, believe the episodes of &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; are true &quot;historical documents&quot;. Inspired by the crew&#x27;s adventures, they have based their society on the virtues espoused by the show.

Sarris returns and demands the &quot;Omega 13&quot; device. He attacks the &quot;Protector&quot; again, and the ship barely escapes through a magnetic minefield. However, the ship&#x27;s power source, a beryllium sphere, is severely damaged. The humans travel to a nearby planet and take a replacement sphere from ferocious, childlike alien miners. Jason is temporarily left behind and fends off a rock creature until the others rescue him. On their return to the &quot;Protector&quot;, the crew discovers that Sarris has seized the ship. After Jason confesses they are just actors, Sarris forces him to explain the truth to the disillusioned Thermian leader, Mathesar. Sarris activates the &quot;Protector&quot;&#x27;s self-destruct mechanism and returns to his ship.

Jason and Gwen manage to abort the self-destruct sequence by following instructions from Brandon, the leader of a group of &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; superfans back on Earth. Meanwhile, Alexander leads a Thermian revolt against Sarris&#x27; forces and takes back control of the &quot;Protector&quot;. With renewed confidence, the crew challenges Sarris and draws his ship into the magnetic minefield, destroying it. As they return to Earth, Sarris, who escaped his ship&#x27;s destruction, ambushes them on the bridge and fatally wounds several crew members. Jason activates the &quot;Omega 13&quot;, which sends everyone 13 seconds back in time and gives Jason and Mathesar a chance to stun and disarm Sarris before the attack.

The &quot;Protector&quot;&#x27;s bridge separates from the main vessel to return the humans to Earth, while the main vessel carries the Thermians into interstellar space. The &quot;Protector&quot; bridge crashes into a &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; convention, and the dazed cast emerges to the applause of their fans. Sarris awakens and levels his gun at the cast, but Jason shoots and destroys him. The crowd assumes it was all a display of special effects and cheers wildly, while the crew basks in their newfound glory.

Sometime later, &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is revived as a sequel series, &quot;Galaxy Quest: The Journey Continues&quot;, with the cast reprising their roles alongside Guy and Laliari as new cast members.

* Tim Allen as Jason Nesmith, who played Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, the commander of the NSEA &quot;Protector&quot; and main character of the series. He is initially a smug ham actor who thrives on his attention within the fandom but is more interested in partying than keeping his schedules.
* Sigourney Weaver as Gwen DeMarco, who played Lieutenant Tawny Madison, the ship&#x27;s communications officer and the only officer aboard who can give orders to the ship&#x27;s computer. She resents how she was more of a sex-object than a character on the show.
* Alan Rickman as Alexander Dane, who played Dr. Lazarus, the ship&#x27;s science officer and a member of the Mak&#x27;tar, an alien species known for their superhuman intelligence and psionic powers. As a Shakespearean actor, he is the most resentful of his character and his catchphrase: &quot;By Grabthar&#x27;s Hammer, by the Suns Of Warvan, you shall be avenged!&quot;
* Tony Shalhoub as Fred Kwan, who played Tech Sergeant Chen, the ship&#x27;s chief engineer, who enters a relationship with Laliari.
* Sam Rockwell as Guy Fleegman, the cast&#x27;s handler at conventions who also played &quot;Crewman #6&quot;, a short-lived minor character, in a single episode. In the revival, he gains a part as Security Chief &quot;Roc&quot; Ingersol.
* Daryl Mitchell as Tommy Webber, who played Lieutenant Laredo, a precocious child pilot.
** Corbin Bleu as a younger Laredo during the original TV series.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
The original spec script by David Howard was titled &quot;Captain Starshine&quot;. Howard stated he got the idea while at an IMAX presentation, where one of the trailers for an upcoming &quot;Americans in Space&quot; film was narrated by Leonard Nimoy, a leading actor from &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The trailer got Howard thinking about how the other &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors had become pigeonholed in these roles since the cancellation of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and he then came up with the idea of &quot;What if there were real aliens involved?&quot; From there, he considered that the rest of his script, &quot;in a lot of ways, just wrote itself, because it just seemed so self-evident once the idea was there&quot;.

Producer Mark Johnson, who had a first-look deal with DreamWorks, did not like Howard&#x27;s script but was fascinated with its concept of space aliens who misconstrue old episodes of a television series as reality. Johnson purchased the script and had Bob Gordon use the concept to create &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;. A fan of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Gordon was hesitant, believing &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; &quot;could be a great idea or it could be a terrible idea&quot; and initially turned it down. Gordon, who did not read &quot;Captain Starshine&quot; until after the film was completed, started from the premise of washed-up actors from a sci-fi series involved with real extraterrestrials. Gordon&#x27;s initial drafts added elements of humor to Howard&#x27;s script, such as the &quot;Protector&quot; scraping the walls of the space dock when Webber pilots the real ship for the first time. The scene with the &quot;Chompers&quot; leading into the Omega 13 came from Gordon&#x27;s viewing of the horror film &quot;Event Horizon&quot;, which featured a rotating tunnel lined with sharp blades leading into the ship&#x27;s engine room. Gordon became more confident when he completed the scene where Nesmith confesses to the Thermians, which he felt he nailed. He submitted his first draft to DreamWorks in 1998, and it was immediately green-lit.

Johnson wanted Dean Parisot to direct. Parisot had directed another film Johnson produced, &quot;Home Fries&quot;. However, DreamWorks favored Harold Ramis because of his experience and hired him in November 1998. Ramis wanted Alec Baldwin for the lead role, but Baldwin turned it down. Steve Martin and Kevin Kline were also considered, but Kline turned it down for family reasons. Ramis did not agree with the casting of Tim Allen as Jason Nesmith and left the project in February 1999. Parisot took over as director within three weeks. Allen said that the version of the film pitched to him by Ramis and Jeffrey Katzenberg felt more like &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, and that they wanted an action star to do comedy rather than a comedian to do an action film. Sigourney Weaver, who had worked with Ramis on &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, said that he also wanted actors who had not appeared in science-fiction roles before, a choice she thought odd since veterans of the genre would know what was humorous. After seeing the film, Ramis said he was impressed with Allen&#x27;s performance. Johnson named the main villain after film critic Andrew Sarris, while admitting he also considered &quot;Haskell&quot; after Molly Haskell, who was married to Sarris. Once Sarris discovered this, he mocked &quot;This guy wants to insult me? Oh, boohoo. As long as they spelled my name right, I&#x27;m okay.&quot;

=== Casting ===
Following Parisot&#x27;s assignment as director, Allen was quickly cast as Nesmith, and had to choose between &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; and &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot;. The &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; role went to Robin Williams. Allen said he was a big sci-fi fan and had hoped the role would launch a second part of his career as a sci-fi actor. Some of Allen&#x27;s sci-fi knowledge was put to use during production: for example, when the crew is about to land on an alien planet, Allen brought up the issue of a breathable atmosphere with Johnson and Parisot; this became dialogue for Fleegman and Kwan in the movie. About his role, Allen said he based his performance more on Yul Brynner&#x27;s Ramesses II from the 1956 &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, and less on William Shatner as Captain James Kirk from &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

Alan Rickman was selected to be Alexander Dane, who played the alien Dr. Lazarus. Rickman had been interested in the part not so much for the sci-fi elements, but because of the humor. He said &quot;I love comedy almost more than anything. This really is one of the funniest scripts I&#x27;ve read,&quot; and that &quot;actors are probably the only professionals who send themselves up. We actually have a sense of humor about ourselves.&quot; While the original script made Dane a ceremonial knight, Rickman suggested the title would be too much for the character, and this was dropped, though he remained listed as &quot;Sir Alex Dane&quot; in the credits. Rickman also provided input into the prosthetic piece that Dane would use to play Lazarus, saying &quot;it was important for it to be good enough to convince the aliens who believe we&#x27;re the real thing, but also cheesy enough to imagine that it was something he applied himself&quot;. Rickman&#x27;s sense of drama came into play during initial reads and script revisions. Rockwell said that Rickman &quot;was very instrumental in making sure the script hit the dramatic notes, and everything had a strong logic and reason behind it&quot;. The scene where Dane, as Dr. Lazarus, gives a final, powerfully emotional speech to Quellek, played by Patrick Breen, used Rickman&#x27;s sense of drama, according to Rockwell. Rickman was initially annoyed with Allen&#x27;s excitement over his role, but eventually the whole cast bonded over the film. Dr. Lazarus&#x27; catchphrase, &quot;By Grabthar&#x27;s Hammer&quot;, was written as a temp line in Gordon&#x27;s script; Gordon planned to replace &quot;Grabthar&quot; with something less comical, but the line stuck as the production crew started using it around their offices and had it printed on t-shirts.

Weaver had loved the script since her first read when Ramis was the director, stating &quot;that great sort of &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; story of these people feeling so incomplete in the beginning, and then during the course of this adventure, they come out almost like the heroes they pretended to be in the first place&quot;. She particularly loved the part of Madison: &quot;to me she was what a lot of women feel like, including myself, in a Hollywood situation.&quot; In addition, she had long wanted to work with both Allen and Rickman. Once Parisot replaced Ramis, Weaver lobbied Parisot to cast her, insisting that Madison needed to be blonde and have large breasts to capture the humor of a sci-fi production. She was surprised when she got the role. Weaver said that this role, given some of her personal insecurities, was closer to &quot;telling the truth about myself and science fiction&quot; compared to her performance as Ripley in the &quot;Alien&quot; films. She wore a blonde wig (which she kept after production) and an enhanced bosom, which many of the crew said gave Weaver a new personality. Weaver often left the set in costume and returned to her hotel to admire herself, saying that she &quot;loved being a starlet&quot;.

Tony Shalhoub originally auditioned for Guy Fleegman until Sam Rockwell was cast. Shalhoub was cast as Fred Kwan and worked with Parisot to develop the character. Kwan was loosely based on David Carradine, who was a non-Asian in an Asian role in the television series &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. Additionally, it was rumored that Carradine frequently acted while under the influence of drugs. Although Shalhoub could not overtly portray a &quot;stoner&quot; in a PG-13 film, he insisted that Kwan should always be shown eating to subtly reference the stoner stereotype.

Rockwell, who wanted to develop a more serious dramatic acting career, initially considered declining the role after he was cast. He eventually recognized that several successful dramatic actors had done comedy roles early on, and his friend Kevin Spacey persuaded him to take the part. He was the last of the main actors to be cast. Rockwell fashioned Fleegman after cowardly characters from other films, such as John Turturro&#x27;s Bernie in &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot;, Bill Paxton&#x27;s Private Hudson in &quot;Aliens&quot;, and Michael Keaton&#x27;s &quot;Blaze&quot; in &quot;Night Shift&quot;. Rockwell drank a lot of coffee before certain scenes to help create the over-excitement and jitters associated with the character. Rockwell&#x27;s character&#x27;s name, Guy Fleegman, is a homage to Guy Vardaman, a little-known actor who worked extensively on &quot;Star Trek&quot; either as a stand-in or in bit roles. Rockwell and Shalhoub improvised some dialog to contrast Fleegman as an alarmist while Kwan was always nonchalant. Daryl Mitchell had worked with Parisot on &quot;Home Fries&quot;, and Parisot felt he was the perfect choice to play Webber. David Alan Grier was the second choice.

Justin Long was cast as Brandon, and it was Long&#x27;s first feature-film role. Long had just completed a pilot for a television show under casting director Bonnie Zane, who suggested Long to her sister Debra Zane, the casting director for &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;. Long said he was nervous auditioning as an unknown actor at the time, competing against Kieran Culkin, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and Tom Everett Scott. Parisot had given Long a copy of &quot;Trekkies&quot;, a film about the &quot;Star Trek&quot; fandom, to help prepare for the character. Long based his character on a combination of Philip Seymour Hoffman&#x27;s Scotty J. from &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and the Comic Book Guy from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Paul Rudd auditioned for a role.

One of the first &quot;Thermians&quot; to audition was Enrico Colantoni. Colantoni loved the script and spent time before his audition developing the behavior he thought the Thermians should have. Parisot said that at the end of Colantoni&#x27;s read, the actor offered a possible voice for the Thermians. Parisot immediately loved the voice and used it to establish the nature of the Thermians for the rest of the casting process. Colantoni led how the Thermians would act, which he called &quot;happy Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&quot; taking everything in with &quot;love and acceptance&quot;. Other actors cast as Thermians included Jed Rees and Rainn Wilson (his feature-film debut). According to Debra Zane, they had &quot;a difficult time finding an actress to play a Thermian. Ultimately, Zane was so impressed with Missi Pyle&#x27;s audition that she sent the casting tape directly to Parisot, with a note stating &quot;If this is not Laliari, I will resign from the CSA.&quot; Steven Spielberg, also impressed by Pyle, asked for Laliari&#x27;s role to be expanded, which developed into the romance with Kwan. Jennifer Coolidge was the second choice for the role.

Actors cast as Thermians went to &quot;alien school&quot; to learn how to move and talk, since they were &quot;basically giant calamari hiding in human shape&quot;, according to Parisot. The walk was inspired by how the marionettes were articulated in the series &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;. Other idiosyncrasies were developed by the actors during this training, and several of their lines came out of improvisations. Wilson&#x27;s role as Lahnk was to have been larger in the film, but the actor was double-booked for an NBC pilot in New York City. He received a crash course on how to act like a Thermian from Colantoni, Rees, and Pyle, but still was nervous around the A-list actors leading the cast. Wilson said that a deleted scene involving Lahnk, released with the film&#x27;s home media, was wisely cut given how nervous he was, flubbing his lines several times.

=== Filming ===
Linda DeScenna, production designer of the film, was interested in the project because it would not have the same aesthetics as other 1990s science fiction films, and &quot;it didn&#x27;t have to be real, hi-tech and vacuformed&quot;. DeScenna drew inspiration for the sets not only from &quot;Star Trek&quot;, but also from &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, and &quot;Lost in Space&quot;. DeScenna had hoped to incorporate more essence of the reuse of props and set elements from these shows within the film, but the film didn&#x27;t provide enough space for this. She used color theming to help distinguish the key elements of the film, with steam blue for the Thermians and the &quot;Protector&quot;, while Saris and his species were made to be a green tone that stood out against that. The design of the Thermian station was influenced by the works of artist Roger Dean, especially his cover art for the Yes live album &quot;Yessongs&quot; (1973).
The bulk of the film was shot in studios in Los Angeles. Scenes of the alien planet were filmed at Goblin Valley State Park in Utah. At the time, access to the park was partly by dirt road; fees paid by the production company were used to upgrade the entire access road to asphalt pavement. Other locations used in the film included the Stahl House as Nesmith&#x27;s home and the Hollywood Palladium for the fan conventions.

According to Weaver, Allen hectored her to sign a piece of the Nostromo, the spaceship from &quot;Alien&quot;, in which she had starred; she ultimately did, writing &quot;Stolen by Tim Allen; Love, Sigourney Weaver&quot;, which she claims upset him greatly. During the period of filming, the entire cast attended a 20th-anniversary screening of &quot;Alien&quot;. After filming wrapped, Weaver kept the wig she wore for the role.

The film&#x27;s visual effects were created by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) led by Bill George. A challenge in the CGI was making distinctions between scenes that were to be from the 1980s &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; show, which would have been done normally through practical effects, and the more realistic scenes for the contemporary actors. Various practical effects were also used, such as the &quot;piglizard&quot; creature that the crew transports onto the &quot;Protector&quot;.

=== Post-production ===
After most production was done, Johnson said that DreamWorks was confused by the film, as it was not what they had expected from the script they greenlit, but pushed on post-production as they needed a film to compete with Columbia Pictures&#x27; &quot;Stuart Little&quot;. The film originally received an &quot;R&quot; rating, according to Collins and Weaver, before being recut to achieve a family-friendly rating. Shalhoub did not remember any darker version of the film. Gordon had not planned to write a &quot;family-friendly&quot; film, and his initial script included mature scenes, such as DeMarco attempting to seduce aliens, and the crash of the escape pod into the convention hall decapitating several attendees.

While &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; was in post-production, Paramount released &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;, which was a box-office success. DreamWorks at that point pushed to have &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; tailored for a younger audience to compete with &quot;Rugrats&quot;. According to the cast and crew, &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; was re-edited to achieve a &quot;PG&quot; rating, requiring scenes to be cut that could have survived if a &quot;PG-13&quot; rating had been targeted instead. In the &quot;chompers&quot; scene, DeMarco&#x27;s line &quot;Well, screw that!&quot; was dubbed over her original &quot;Well, fuck that!&quot; Weaver stated she purposely made her dubbed line stand out as a form of protest from her original line. Several scenes involving Dr. Lazarus were cut, as DreamWorks felt they were too kinky for the desired rating. One cut scene showed Dr. Lazarus&#x27; crew quarters on the Protector, which Allen called a &quot;proctologist&#x27;s dream and nightmare&quot;. Other scenes were added to provide what Dreamworks felt was necessary continuity for the intended younger audience, such as showing the limo with Nesmith and the aliens &quot;beaming up&quot; from Earth.

In theaters, the first 20 minutes of the film were presented in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio (minus the opening showing clips from the TV show which were in 1.33:1), before changing to a wider 2.35:1 ratio when Nesmith looks out upon space as the &quot;Protector&quot; arrives at Thermia to maximize the effect on viewers. However, this caused some problems with projectionists at movie theaters when showing the film as they had not opened up the screen curtains far enough for the wider aspect ratio. Projectionists had to be told at later showings to prepare for this transition. On all widescreen home video releases, however, after the opening scene showing the TV clips, it goes directly from 1.33:1 to 2.35:1 and remains that way for the rest of the movie. David Newman composed the score.

=== Promotion ===
Before the release, a promotional mockumentary video titled &quot;Galaxy Quest: 20th Anniversary, The Journey Continues&quot;, aired on E!, presenting the &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; television series as an actual cult series, and the upcoming film as a documentary about the making of the series, presenting it in a similar way to &quot;Star Trek&quot;; it featured fake interviews of the series&#x27; cast (portrayed by the actors of the actual film), &quot;Questerians&quot;, and critics.

While these additional materials were made, DreamWorks devoted very little advertising to the film despite its placement near the Christmas season, which the cast and crew felt hurt the potential for the film. Unlike most films where the second and ongoing weekend box office takes decline, &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; saw rising numbers over the first several weekends, and DreamWorks&#x27; Jeffrey Katzenberg apologized directly to Parisot for failing to market the film properly. Additionally, the primary trailer used for the film used a cut of the film before all the specific effects were complete, and Johnson felt that if the trailer had used the completed versions, it would have helped draw a larger audience.

=== Relation to &quot;Star Trek&quot; and other science fiction works ===
&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is an acknowledged homage to &quot;Star Trek&quot;; Parisot said &quot;Part of the mission for me was to make a great ″&quot;Star Trek&quot;″ episode.&quot; Gordon&#x27;s original script was titled &quot;Galaxy Quest: The Motion Picture&quot; as a reference to the first feature &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, and elements such as departing the space dock and the malfunctioning transporters were further nods to the film. The prefix of the &quot;Protector&quot;″s registration number NTE-3120 ostensibly alludes to some sort of similar space federation, but in reality stands for &quot;Not The Enterprise&quot;, according to visual effects co-supervisor Bill George. Parisot refuted claims that the rock monster that Nesmith battled was based on the rock monster that had been scripted for &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot;, but instead was more inspired by the Gorn that Kirk faces in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Arena&quot;. This homage also extended to the original marketing of the movie, including a promotional website intentionally designed to look like a poorly constructed fan website, with &quot;screen captures&quot; and poor HTML coding.

Other aspects of the film were homages to other seminal science fiction works. The Thermians&#x27; native planet, Klaatu Nebula, is a reference to the name of the alien visitor in the classic &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951). Quellek&#x27;s line &quot;I&#x27;m shot&quot; was influenced by the same line from James Brolin&#x27;s character in &quot;Westworld&quot;. The blue creatures on the alien planet were based on similar creatures in &quot;Barbarella&quot;. The &quot;chompers&quot; scene with Nesmith and DeMarco trying to reach the self-destruct abort button was inspired by a scene from the 1997 film &quot;Event Horizon&quot; involving whirring blades. The effects for the Omega 13 activation were inspired by the ending scene from &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot;.

In his review of &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;, James Berardinelli states that the movie shares the &quot;same central conceit&quot; with a short story by Ruth Berman titled &quot;Visit to a Weird Planet Revisited&quot; published in the 1976 anthology &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot; in which William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley are transported to the real while filming an episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; and are pursued by Klingons.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

Critics praised it both as a parody of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and as a comedy film of its own. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Lawrence Van Gelder called it &quot;an amiable comedy that simultaneously manages to spoof these popular futuristic space adventures and replicate the very elements that have made them so durable&quot;. Roger Ebert, writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, praised the ability of the film to spoof the &quot;illogic of the TV show&quot;. Amy Taubin of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; offered a lukewarm review, noting that &quot;the many eight- to 11-year-olds in the audience seemed completely enthralled&quot;. Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; said that &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; &quot;remains light and bright as it races along, and never turns nasty or mean-spirited as it satirizes the cliches and cults of &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot;.

Retrospective reviews for &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; have been positive. &quot;Esquire&quot; Matt Miller said in 2019 &quot;the film absolutely holds up as one of the best sci-fi satires ever made—one that challenges our obsession with massive Hollywood franchises, the nature of fandom, and some of the more problematic cliches of the genre. But it does so with a self-aware empathy that makes it an enduring and lasting entry in not only science-fiction, but American film as a whole&quot;. Writer-director David Mamet, in his book &quot;Bambi vs. Godzilla: On the Nature, Purpose, and Practice of the Movie Business&quot;, included &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; in a list of four &quot;perfect&quot; films, along with &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; and &quot;Dodsworth&quot;.

=== Box office ===
&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; grossed $71.6million in the United States and Canada, and $19.1million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $90.7million, double the original budget of $45million. It spent its first nine weeks in the Top 10 at the box office.

=== Accolades ===
=== Impact and legacy ===
The film proved popular with &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans. At the 2013 Star Trek Convention in Las Vegas, &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; received enough support in a &quot;Star Trek&quot; Film Ranking to be included with the twelve &quot;Star Trek&quot; films that had been released at the time on the voting ballot. The fans at the convention ranked it the seventh-best &quot;Star Trek&quot; film. Tim Allen said he and William Shatner were &quot;now friends because of this movie&quot;.

&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; predicted the growth and influence of media fandom in the years after its release. While fandoms such as that for &quot;Star Trek&quot; existed at the time of the film, the size and scope presented by the fan conventions in the film had not been seen as much in 1999; since then, major fan conventions such as San Diego Comic-Con have become significant events that draw mainstream attention. The film also depicted fandoms using their numbers to influence production companies to revive cancelled works, such as with &quot;The Expanse&quot;, &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, and &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. The film also captured some negative elements of modern fandom, such as leading actors continuously pestered by fans for intricate details of the work&#x27;s fiction and other elements of the potentially toxic culture of online fan groups. The novella &quot;Rabbit Remembered&quot; (2000) by John Updike mentions the character of Laliari from the film.

==== Reaction from &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors ====
Several actors who have had roles on various &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series and films have commented on &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; in light of their own experiences with the franchise and its fandom.

===Home video===
The film was released by DreamWorks Home Entertainment on VHS and DVD on May 2, 2000. The DVD version included a 10-minute behind-the-scenes feature, cast and crew biographies and interviews, and deleted scenes. A special 10th anniversary deluxe edition was released on both DVD and Blu-ray by Paramount Home Entertainment on May 12, 2009; though they lacked the same features on the original DVD release, they included several new featurettes on the film&#x27;s history, the cast, and the special effects used in the film&#x27;s making, alongside the deleted scenes. For the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary, a &quot;Never Give Up, Never Surrender Edition&quot; Blu-ray was released on November 5, 2019, featuring the same features as the 10th edition; a special SteelBook Best Buy exclusive was released on September 17, 2019.

=== Tie-in media ===
In November 1999, &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; was novelized by science fiction writer Terry Bisson, who stayed very close to the plot of the film.

In 2008, IDW Publishing released a comic book sequel to the movie entitled &quot;Galaxy Quest: Global Warning&quot;. In January 2015, IDW launched a four-issue series set several years after the events of the film called &quot;Galaxy Quest: The Journey Continues&quot;. In 2021, Eaglemoss Publications released a behind-the-scenes book entitled &quot;Galaxy Quest: The Inside Story&quot;.

=== Proposed sequel or television series ===
Talks of a sequel have been going on since the film&#x27;s release in 1999, but only began gaining traction in 2014 when Allen mentioned that there was a script. Stars Weaver and Rockwell mentioned they were interested in returning. However, Colantoni has said he would prefer for there not to be a sequel, lest it tarnish the characters from the first film. He said, &quot;to make something up, just because we love those characters, and turn it into a sequel—then it becomes the awful sequel&quot;.

In April 2015, Paramount Television, along with the movie&#x27;s co-writer Gordon, director Parisot, and executive producers Johnson and Bernstein, announced they were looking to develop a television series based on &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;. The move was considered in a similar vein as Paramount&#x27;s revivals of &quot;Minority Report&quot; and &quot;School of Rock&quot; as television series. In August 2015, it was announced that Amazon Studios would be developing it.

In January 2016, after the unexpected death of Alan Rickman from pancreatic cancer, Tim Allen commented in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; about the franchise&#x27;s chance of a revival:

Speaking to the Nerdist podcast in April 2016, Sam Rockwell revealed that the cast had been about ready to sign on for a follow-up with Amazon, but Rickman&#x27;s death, together with Allen&#x27;s television schedule, had proved to be obstacles. He also said he believed Rickman&#x27;s death meant the project would never happen.

However, the plans were revived in August 2017, with the announcement that Paul Scheer would be writing the series. Speaking to &quot;/Film&quot;, Scheer said that in his first drafts submitted to Amazon in November 2017 he wanted to create a serialized adventure that starts where the film ends, but leads into the cultural shift in &quot;Star Trek&quot; that has occurred since 1999; he said &quot;I really wanted to capture the difference between the original cast of &quot;Star Trek&quot; and the J. J. Abrams cast of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.&quot; To that end, Scheer&#x27;s initial scripts called for two separate cast sets that would come together by the end of the first season of the show, though he did not confirm if this included any of the original film&#x27;s cast.

Following the dismissal of Amy Powell as president of Paramount Television in July 2018, Scheer said the &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; series had been put on hold while Paramount&#x27;s management was being re-established, but anticipated the show would continue forward after that. He also said they were making the series to allow the introduction of new characters while extending the setting, similar to what &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; did for &quot;A New Hope&quot;.

Allen stated that a film sequel script is nearly ready to go as of January 2021. The script had been near completion for production by 2016 but with Rickman&#x27;s death, it would have to undergo major rewrites as the core story focused on the relationship between Nesmith and Dane (Allen and Rickman&#x27;s characters, respectively). A central plot element was to have the &quot;Protector&quot; and its crew affected by time dilation during space flight, which Allen considered a boon for the uncertain production of the film. While Allen said there were no immediate efforts for the sequel&#x27;s production, he and the other cast and crew keep circulating the idea and believe it would be easy to restart the effort.

Georgia Pritchett stated in a June 2021 interview that she and Simon Pegg were working on developing a &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; television series. Paramount was stated to be in the early stages of a &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; series in April 2023 for the Paramount+ streaming service, with production overseen by Johnson.

=== Documentary ===
&quot;Never Surrender: A Galaxy Quest Documentary&quot; was produced by the web site Fandom in 2019 to celebrate the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary. Titled after Captain Taggart&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;Never give up, never surrender!&quot;, it features interviews with the movie&#x27;s cast and crew, including Allen, Weaver, Rockwell, Shalhoub, Long, Pyle, Wilson, and Mitchell, along with director Parisot and writer Gordon, as well as celebrities including Wil Wheaton, Brent Spiner, Greg Berlanti, Paul Scheer, and Damon Lindelof, who have spoken of their love for the film. Initially premiering to a limited audience at the October 2019 New York Comic Con, it subsequently had a limited theatrical showing at about 600 screens through Fathom Events on November 26, 2019, which included a screening of deleted scenes as well as the debut of Screen Junkies&#x27; &quot;Honest Trailer&quot; for &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;. The film was made available on various digital media services for purchase in December 2019.
