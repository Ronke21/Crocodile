<text>Friction is the force resisting the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid layers, and material elements sliding against each other. Types of friction include dry, fluid, lubricated, skin, and internal -- an incomplete list. The study of the processes involved is called tribology, and has a history of more than 2000 years.

Friction can have dramatic consequences, as illustrated by the use of friction created by rubbing pieces of wood together to start a fire. Another important consequence of many types of friction can be wear, which may lead to performance degradation or damage to components. It is known that frictional energy losses account for about 20% of the total energy expenditure of the world.

As briefly discussed later, there are many different contributors to the retarding force in friction, ranging from asperity deformation to the generation of charges and changes in local structure. Friction is not itself a fundamental force, it is a non-conservative force – work done against friction is path dependent. In the presence of friction, some mechanical energy is transformed to heat as well as the free energy of the structural changes and other types of dissipation, so mechanical energy is not conserved. The complexity of the interactions involved makes the calculation of friction from first principles difficult and it is often easier to use empirical methods for analysis and the development of theory.

==Types==
There are several types of friction:
* Dry friction is a force that opposes the relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact. Dry friction is subdivided into &quot;static friction&quot; (&quot;stiction&quot;) between non-moving surfaces, and &quot;kinetic friction&quot; between moving surfaces. With the exception of atomic or molecular friction, dry friction generally arises from the interaction of surface features, known as asperities (see Figure).
* Fluid friction describes the friction between layers of a viscous fluid that are moving relative to each other.
* Lubricated friction is a case of fluid friction where a lubricant fluid separates two solid surfaces.
* Skin friction is a component of drag, the force resisting the motion of a fluid across the surface of a body.
* Internal friction is the force resisting motion between the elements making up a solid material while it undergoes deformation.

==History==
Many ancient authors including Aristotle, Vitruvius, and Pliny the Elder, were interested in the cause and mitigation of friction. They were aware of differences between static and kinetic friction with Themistius stating in 350 that &quot;it is easier to further the motion of a moving body than to move a body at rest&quot;.

The classic laws of sliding friction were discovered by Leonardo da Vinci in 1493, a pioneer in tribology, but the laws documented in his notebooks were not published and remained unknown. These laws were rediscovered by Guillaume Amontons in 1699 and became known as Amonton&#x27;s three laws of dry friction. Amontons presented the nature of friction in terms of surface irregularities and the force required to raise the weight pressing the surfaces together. This view was further elaborated by Bernard Forest de Bélidor and Leonhard Euler (1750), who derived the angle of repose of a weight on an inclined plane and first distinguished between static and kinetic friction.
John Theophilus Desaguliers (1734) first recognized the role of adhesion in friction. Microscopic forces cause surfaces to stick together; he proposed that friction was the force necessary to tear the adhering surfaces apart.

The understanding of friction was further developed by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1785). Coulomb investigated the influence of four main factors on friction: the nature of the materials in contact and their surface coatings; the extent of the surface area; the normal pressure (or load); and the length of time that the surfaces remained in contact (time of repose). Coulomb further considered the influence of sliding velocity, temperature and humidity, in order to decide between the different explanations on the nature of friction that had been proposed. The distinction between static and dynamic friction is made in Coulomb&#x27;s friction law (see below), although this distinction was already drawn by Johann Andreas von Segner in 1758.
The effect of the time of repose was explained by Pieter van Musschenbroek (1762) by considering the surfaces of fibrous materials, with fibers meshing together, which takes a finite time in which the friction increases.

John Leslie (1766–1832) noted a weakness in the views of Amontons and Coulomb: If friction arises from a weight being drawn up the inclined plane of successive asperities, then why is it not balanced through descending the opposite slope? Leslie was equally skeptical about the role of adhesion proposed by Desaguliers, which should on the whole have the same tendency to accelerate as to retard the motion. In Leslie&#x27;s view, friction should be seen as a time-dependent process of flattening, pressing down asperities, which creates new obstacles in what were cavities before.
In the long course of the development of the law of conservation of energy and of the first law of thermodynamics, friction was recognised as a mode of conversion of mechanical work into heat. In 1798, Benjamin Thompson reported on cannon boring experiments.

Arthur Jules Morin (1833) developed the concept of sliding versus rolling friction.

In 1842, Julius Robert Mayer frictionally generated heat in paper pulp and measured the temperature rise. In 1845, Joule published a paper entitled &quot;The Mechanical Equivalent of Heat&quot;, in which he specified a numerical value for the amount of mechanical work required to &quot;produce a unit of heat&quot;, based on the friction of an electric current passing through a resistor, and on the friction of a paddle wheel rotating in a vat of water.

Osborne Reynolds (1866) derived the equation of viscous flow. This completed the classic empirical model of friction (static, kinetic, and fluid) commonly used today in engineering. In 1877, Fleeming Jenkin and J. A. Ewing investigated the continuity between static and kinetic friction.

In 1907, G.H. Bryan published an investigation of the foundations of thermodynamics, &quot;Thermodynamics: an Introductory Treatise dealing mainly with First Principles and their Direct Applications&quot;. He noted that for a rough body driven over a rough surface, the mechanical work done by the driver exceeds the mechanical work received by the surface. The lost work is accounted for by heat generated by friction.

Over the years, for example in his 1879 thesis, but particularly in 1926, Planck advocated regarding the generation of heat by rubbing as the most specific way to define heat, and the prime example of an irreversible thermodynamic process.

The focus of research during the 20th century has been to understand the physical mechanisms behind friction. Frank Philip Bowden and David Tabor (1950) showed that, at a microscopic level, the actual area of contact between surfaces is a very small fraction of the apparent area. This actual area of contact, caused by asperities increases with pressure. The development of the atomic force microscope (ca. 1986) enabled scientists to study friction at the atomic scale, showing that, on that scale, dry friction is the product of the inter-surface shear stress and the contact area. These two discoveries explain Amonton&#x27;s first law &quot;(below)&quot;; the macroscopic proportionality between normal force and static frictional force between dry surfaces.

==Laws of dry friction==
The elementary property of sliding (kinetic) friction were discovered by experiment in the 15th to 18th centuries and were expressed as three empirical laws:
* Amontons&#x27; First Law: The force of friction is directly proportional to the applied load.
* Amontons&#x27; Second Law: The force of friction is independent of the apparent area of contact.
* Coulomb&#x27;s Law of Friction: Kinetic friction is independent of the sliding velocity.

==Dry friction==
Dry friction resists relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact. The two regimes of dry friction are &#x27;static friction&#x27; (&quot;stiction&quot;) between non-moving surfaces, and &quot;kinetic friction&quot; (sometimes called sliding friction or dynamic friction) between moving surfaces.

Coulomb friction, named after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, is an approximate model used to calculate the force of dry friction. It is governed by the model:
formula_1
where
* formula_2 is the force of friction exerted by each surface on the other. It is parallel to the surface, in a direction opposite to the net applied force.
* formula_3 is the coefficient of friction, which is an empirical property of the contacting materials,
* formula_4 is the normal force exerted by each surface on the other, directed perpendicular (normal) to the surface.

The Coulomb friction formula_2 may take any value from zero up to formula_6, and the direction of the frictional force against a surface is opposite to the motion that surface would experience in the absence of friction. Thus, in the static case, the frictional force is exactly what it must be in order to prevent motion between the surfaces; it balances the net force tending to cause such motion. In this case, rather than providing an estimate of the actual frictional force, the Coulomb approximation provides a threshold value for this force, above which motion would commence. This maximum force is known as traction.

The force of friction is always exerted in a direction that opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) between the two surfaces. For example, a curling stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down. For an example of potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note that it is not the direction of movement of the vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.

===Normal force===


The normal force is defined as the net force compressing two parallel surfaces together, and its direction is perpendicular to the surfaces. In the simple case of a mass resting on a horizontal surface, the only component of the normal force is the force due to gravity, where formula_7. In this case, conditions of equilibrium tell us that the magnitude of the friction force is &quot;zero&quot;, formula_8. In fact, the friction force always satisfies formula_9, with equality reached only at a critical ramp angle (given by formula_10) that is steep enough to initiate sliding.

The friction coefficient is an empirical (experimentally measured) structural property that depends only on various aspects of the contacting materials, such as surface roughness. The coefficient of friction is not a function of mass or volume. For instance, a large aluminum block has the same coefficient of friction as a small aluminum block. However, the magnitude of the friction force itself depends on the normal force, and hence on the mass of the block.

Depending on the situation, the calculation of the normal force formula_11 might include forces other than gravity. If an object is on a and subjected to an external force formula_12 tending to cause it to slide, then the normal force between the object and the surface is just formula_13, where formula_14 is the block&#x27;s weight and formula_15 is the downward component of the external force. Prior to sliding, this friction force is formula_16, where formula_17 is the horizontal component of the external force. Thus, formula_18 in general. Sliding commences only after this frictional force reaches the value formula_19. Until then, friction is whatever it needs to be to provide equilibrium, so it can be treated as simply a reaction.

If the object is on a such as an inclined plane, the normal force from gravity is smaller than formula_14, because less of the force of gravity is perpendicular to the face of the plane. The normal force and the frictional force are ultimately determined using vector analysis, usually via a free body diagram.

In general, process for solving any statics problem with friction is to treat contacting surfaces &quot;tentatively&quot; as immovable so that the corresponding tangential reaction force between them can be calculated. If this frictional reaction force satisfies formula_18, then the tentative assumption was correct, and it is the actual frictional force. Otherwise, the friction force must be set equal to formula_19, and then the resulting force imbalance would then determine the acceleration associated with slipping.

===Coefficient of friction===
The coefficient of friction (COF), often symbolized by the Greek letter μ, is a dimensionless scalar value which equals the ratio of the force of friction between two bodies and the force pressing them together, either during or at the onset of slipping. The coefficient of friction depends on the materials used; for example, ice on steel has a low coefficient of friction, while rubber on pavement has a high coefficient of friction. Coefficients of friction range from near zero to greater than one. The coefficient of friction between two surfaces of similar metals is greater than that between two surfaces of different metals; for example, brass has a higher coefficient of friction when moved against brass, but less if moved against steel or aluminum.

For surfaces at rest relative to each other, formula_23, where formula_24 is the &quot;coefficient of static friction&quot;. This is usually larger than its kinetic counterpart. The coefficient of static friction exhibited by a pair of contacting surfaces depends upon the combined effects of material deformation characteristics and surface roughness, both of which have their origins in the chemical bonding between atoms in each of the bulk materials and between the material surfaces and any adsorbed material. The fractality of surfaces, a parameter describing the scaling behavior of surface asperities, is known to play an important role in determining the magnitude of the static friction.

For surfaces in relative motion formula_25, where formula_26 is the &quot;coefficient of kinetic friction&quot;. The Coulomb friction is equal to formula_2, and the frictional force on each surface is exerted in the direction opposite to its motion relative to the other surface.

Arthur Morin introduced the term and demonstrated the utility of the coefficient of friction. The coefficient of friction is an empirical measurementit has to be measured experimentally, and cannot be found through calculations. Rougher surfaces tend to have higher effective values. Both static and kinetic coefficients of friction depend on the pair of surfaces in contact; for a given pair of surfaces, the coefficient of static friction is &quot;usually&quot; larger than that of kinetic friction; in some sets the two coefficients are equal, such as teflon-on-teflon.

Most dry materials in combination have friction coefficient values between 0.3 and 0.6. Values outside this range are rarer, but teflon, for example, can have a coefficient as low as 0.04. A value of zero would mean no friction at all, an elusive property. Rubber in contact with other surfaces can yield friction coefficients from 1 to 2. Occasionally it is maintained that &quot;μ&quot; is always &lt; 1, but this is not true. While in most relevant applications &quot;μ&quot; &lt; 1, a value above 1 merely implies that the force required to slide an object along the surface is greater than the normal force of the surface on the object. For example, silicone rubber or acrylic rubber-coated surfaces have a coefficient of friction that can be substantially larger than 1.

While it is often stated that the COF is a &quot;material property&quot;, it is better categorized as a &quot;system property&quot;. Unlike true material properties (such as conductivity, dielectric constant, yield strength), the COF for any two materials depends on system variables like temperature, velocity, atmosphere and also what are now popularly described as aging and deaging times; as well as on geometric properties of the interface between the materials, namely surface structure. For example, a copper pin sliding against a thick copper plate can have a COF that varies from 0.6 at low speeds (metal sliding against metal) to below 0.2 at high speeds when the copper surface begins to melt due to frictional heating. The latter speed, of course, does not determine the COF uniquely; if the pin diameter is increased so that the frictional heating is removed rapidly, the temperature drops, the pin remains solid and the COF rises to that of a &#x27;low speed&#x27; test.

In systems with significant non-uniform stress fields, because local slip occurs before the system slides, the macroscopic coefficient of static friction depends on the applied load, system size, or shape; Amontons&#x27; law is not satisfied macroscopically.

====Approximate coefficients of friction====

Under certain conditions some materials have very low friction coefficients. An example is (highly ordered pyrolytic) graphite which can have a friction coefficient below 0.01.
This ultralow-friction regime is called superlubricity.

===Static friction===

Static friction is friction between two or more solid objects that are not moving relative to each other. For example, static friction can prevent an object from sliding down a sloped surface. The coefficient of static friction, typically denoted as &quot;μ&quot;s, is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Static friction is considered to arise as the result of surface roughness features across multiple length scales at solid surfaces. These features, known as asperities are present down to nano-scale dimensions and result in true solid to solid contact existing only at a limited number of points accounting for only a fraction of the apparent or nominal contact area. The linearity between applied load and true contact area, arising from asperity deformation, gives rise to the linearity between static frictional force and normal force, found for typical Amonton–Coulomb type friction.

The static friction force must be overcome by an applied force before an object can move. The maximum possible friction force between two surfaces before sliding begins is the product of the coefficient of static friction and the normal force: formula_28. When there is no sliding occurring, the friction force can have any value from zero up to formula_29. Any force smaller than formula_29 attempting to slide one surface over the other is opposed by a frictional force of equal magnitude and opposite direction. Any force larger than formula_29 overcomes the force of static friction and causes sliding to occur. The instant sliding occurs, static friction is no longer applicable—the friction between the two surfaces is then called kinetic friction. However, an apparent static friction can be observed even in the case when the true static friction is zero.

An example of static friction is the force that prevents a car wheel from slipping as it rolls on the ground. Even though the wheel is in motion, the patch of the tire in contact with the ground is stationary relative to the ground, so it is static rather than kinetic friction. Upon slipping, the wheel friction changes to kinetic friction. An anti-lock braking system operates on the principle of allowing a locked wheel to resume rotating so that the car maintains static friction.

The maximum value of static friction, when motion is impending, is sometimes referred to as limiting friction,
although this term is not used universally.

===Kinetic friction===
Kinetic friction, also known as dynamic friction or sliding friction, occurs when two objects are moving relative to each other and rub together (like a sled on the ground). The coefficient of kinetic friction is typically denoted as &quot;μ&quot;k, and is usually less than the coefficient of static friction for the same materials. However, Richard Feynman comments that &quot;with dry metals it is very hard to show any difference.&quot;
The friction force between two surfaces after sliding begins is the product of the coefficient of kinetic friction and the normal force: formula_32. This is responsible for the Coulomb damping of an oscillating or vibrating system.

New models are beginning to show how kinetic friction can be greater than static friction. In many other cases roughness effects are dominant, for example in rubber to road friction. Surface roughness and contact area affect kinetic friction for micro- and nano-scale objects where surface area forces dominate inertial forces.

The origin of kinetic friction at nanoscale can be rationalized by an energy model. During sliding, a new surface forms at the back of a sliding true contact, and existing surface disappears at the front of it. Since all surfaces involve the thermodynamic surface energy, work must be spent in creating the new surface, and energy is released as heat in removing the surface. Thus, a force is required to move the back of the contact, and frictional heat is released at the front.

===Angle of friction===

For certain applications, it is more useful to define static friction in terms of the maximum angle before which one of the items will begin sliding. This is called the &quot;angle of friction&quot; or &quot;friction angle&quot;. It is defined as:
formula_33
and thus:
formula_34
where formula_35 is the angle from horizontal and &quot;μs&quot; is the static coefficient of friction between the objects. This formula can also be used to calculate &quot;μs&quot; from empirical measurements of the friction angle.

===Friction at the atomic level===
Determining the forces required to move atoms past each other is a challenge in designing nanomachines. In 2008 scientists for the first time were able to move a single atom across a surface, and measure the forces required. Using ultrahigh vacuum and nearly zero temperature (5 K), a modified atomic force microscope was used to drag a cobalt atom, and a carbon monoxide molecule, across surfaces of copper and platinum.

===Limitations of the Coulomb model===
The Coulomb approximation follows from the assumptions that: surfaces are in atomically close contact only over a small fraction of their overall area; that this contact area is proportional to the normal force (until saturation, which takes place when all area is in atomic contact); and that the frictional force is proportional to the applied normal force, independently of the contact area. The Coulomb approximation is fundamentally an empirical construct. It is a rule-of-thumb describing the approximate outcome of an extremely complicated physical interaction. The strength of the approximation is its simplicity and versatility. Though the relationship between normal force and frictional force is not exactly linear (and so the frictional force is not entirely independent of the contact area of the surfaces), the Coulomb approximation is an adequate representation of friction for the analysis of many physical systems.

When the surfaces are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes a very poor approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even when there is no normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.

====&quot;Negative&quot; coefficient of friction====
, a single study has demonstrated the potential for an &quot;effectively negative coefficient of friction in the low-load regime&quot;, meaning that a decrease in normal force leads to an increase in friction. This contradicts everyday experience in which an increase in normal force leads to an increase in friction. This was reported in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; in October 2012 and involved the friction encountered by an atomic force microscope stylus when dragged across a graphene sheet in the presence of graphene-adsorbed oxygen.

===Numerical simulation of the Coulomb model===
Despite being a simplified model of friction, the Coulomb model is useful in many numerical simulation applications such as multibody systems and granular material. Even its most simple expression encapsulates the fundamental effects of sticking and sliding which are required in many applied cases, although specific algorithms have to be designed in order to efficiently numerically integrate mechanical systems with Coulomb friction and bilateral or unilateral contact. Some quite nonlinear effects, such as the so-called Painlevé paradoxes, may be encountered with Coulomb friction.

===Dry friction and instabilities===
Dry friction can induce several types of instabilities in mechanical systems which display a stable behaviour in the absence of friction.
These instabilities may be caused by the decrease of the friction force with an increasing velocity of sliding, by material expansion due to heat generation during friction (the thermo-elastic instabilities), or by pure dynamic effects of sliding of two elastic materials (the Adams–Martins instabilities). The latter were originally discovered in 1995 by George G. Adams and João Arménio Correia Martins for smooth surfaces and were later found in periodic rough surfaces. In particular, friction-related dynamical instabilities are thought to be responsible for brake squeal and the &#x27;song&#x27; of a glass harp, phenomena which involve stick and slip, modelled as a drop of friction coefficient with velocity.

A practically important case is the self-oscillation of the strings of bowed instruments such as the violin, cello, hurdy-gurdy, erhu, etc.

A connection between dry friction and flutter instability in a simple mechanical system has been discovered, watch the movie for more details.

Frictional instabilities can lead to the formation of new self-organized patterns (or &quot;secondary structures&quot;) at the sliding interface, such as in-situ formed tribofilms which are utilized for the reduction of friction and wear in so-called self-lubricating materials.

==Fluid friction==
Fluid friction occurs between fluid layers that are moving relative to each other. This internal resistance to flow is named &quot;viscosity&quot;. In everyday terms, the viscosity of a fluid is described as its &quot;thickness&quot;. Thus, water is &quot;thin&quot;, having a lower viscosity, while honey is &quot;thick&quot;, having a higher viscosity. The less viscous the fluid, the greater its ease of deformation or movement.

All real fluids (except superfluids) offer some resistance to shearing and therefore are viscous. For teaching and explanatory purposes it is helpful to use the concept of an inviscid fluid or an ideal fluid which offers no resistance to shearing and so is not viscous.

==Lubricated friction==
Lubricated friction is a case of fluid friction where a fluid separates two solid surfaces. Lubrication is a technique employed to reduce wear of one or both surfaces in close proximity moving relative to each another by interposing a substance called a lubricant between the surfaces.

In most cases the applied load is carried by pressure generated within the fluid due to the frictional viscous resistance to motion of the lubricating fluid between the surfaces. Adequate lubrication allows smooth continuous operation of equipment, with only mild wear, and without excessive stresses or seizures at bearings. When lubrication breaks down, metal or other components can rub destructively over each other, causing heat and possibly damage or failure.

==Skin friction==
Skin friction arises from the interaction between the fluid and the skin of the body, and is directly related to the area of the surface of the body that is in contact with the fluid. Skin friction follows the drag equation and rises with the square of the velocity.

Skin friction is caused by viscous drag in the boundary layer around the object. There are two ways to decrease skin friction: the first is to shape the moving body so that smooth flow is possible, like an airfoil. The second method is to decrease the length and cross-section of the moving object as much as is practicable.

==Internal friction==
Internal friction is the force resisting motion between the elements making up a solid material while it undergoes deformation.

Plastic deformation in solids is an irreversible change in the internal molecular structure of an object. This change may be due to either (or both) an applied force or a change in temperature. The change of an object&#x27;s shape is called strain. The force causing it is called stress.

Elastic deformation in solids is reversible change in the internal molecular structure of an object. Stress does not necessarily cause permanent change. As deformation occurs, internal forces oppose the applied force. If the applied stress is not too large these opposing forces may completely resist the applied force, allowing the object to assume a new equilibrium state and to return to its original shape when the force is removed. This is known as elastic deformation or elasticity.

==Radiation friction==
As a consequence of light pressure, Einstein in 1909 predicted the existence of &quot;radiation friction&quot; which would oppose the movement of matter. He wrote, &quot;radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backward-acting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant &#x27;radiation friction&#x27; in brief.&quot;

==Other types of friction==

===Rolling resistance===
Rolling resistance is the force that resists the rolling of a wheel or other circular object along a surface caused by deformations in the object or surface. Generally the force of rolling resistance is less than that associated with kinetic friction. Typical values for the coefficient of rolling resistance are 0.001.
One of the most common examples of rolling resistance is the movement of motor vehicle tires on a road, a process which generates heat and sound as by-products.

===Braking friction===
Any wheel equipped with a brake is capable of generating a large retarding force, usually for the purpose of slowing and stopping a vehicle or piece of rotating machinery. Braking friction differs from rolling friction because the coefficient of friction for rolling friction is small whereas the coefficient of friction for braking friction is designed to be large by choice of materials for brake pads.

===Triboelectric effect===
Rubbing two materials against each other can lead to charge transfer, either electrons or ions. The energy required for this contributes to the friction. In addition, sliding can cause a build-up of electrostatic charge, which can be hazardous if flammable gases or vapours are present. When the static build-up discharges, explosions can be caused by ignition of the flammable mixture.

===Belt friction===

Belt friction is a physical property observed from the forces acting on a belt wrapped around a pulley, when one end is being pulled. The resulting tension, which acts on both ends of the belt, can be modeled by the belt friction equation.

In practice, the theoretical tension acting on the belt or rope calculated by the belt friction equation can be compared to the maximum tension the belt can support. This helps a designer of such a rig to know how many times the belt or rope must be wrapped around the pulley to prevent it from slipping. Mountain climbers and sailing crews demonstrate a standard knowledge of belt friction when accomplishing basic tasks.

==Reduction==

===Devices===
Devices such as wheels, ball bearings, roller bearings, and air cushion or other types of fluid bearings can change sliding friction into a much smaller type of rolling friction.

Many thermoplastic materials such as nylon, HDPE and PTFE are commonly used in low friction bearings. They are especially useful because the coefficient of friction falls with increasing imposed load. For improved wear resistance, very high molecular weight grades are usually specified for heavy duty or critical bearings.

===Lubricants===
A common way to reduce friction is by using a lubricant, such as oil, water, or grease, which is placed between the two surfaces, often dramatically lessening the coefficient of friction. The science of friction and lubrication is called tribology. Lubricant technology is when lubricants are mixed with the application of science, especially to industrial or commercial objectives.

Superlubricity, a recently discovered effect, has been observed in graphite: it is the substantial decrease of friction between two sliding objects, approaching zero levels. A very small amount of frictional energy would still be dissipated.

Lubricants to overcome friction need not always be thin, turbulent fluids or powdery solids such as graphite and talc; acoustic lubrication actually uses sound as a lubricant.

Another way to reduce friction between two parts is to superimpose micro-scale vibration to one of the parts. This can be sinusoidal vibration as used in ultrasound-assisted cutting or vibration noise, known as dither.

==Energy of friction==
According to the law of conservation of energy, no energy is destroyed due to friction, though it may be lost to the system of concern. Mechanical energy is transformed into heat. A sliding hockey puck comes to rest because friction converts its kinetic energy into heat which raises the internal energy of the puck and the ice surface. Since heat quickly dissipates, many early philosophers, including Aristotle, wrongly concluded that moving objects come to rest spontaneously.

When an object is pushed along a surface along a path C, the energy converted to heat is given by a line integral, in accordance with the definition of work

:formula_36
where
* formula_37 is the friction force,
* formula_38 is the vector obtained by multiplying the magnitude of the normal force by a unit vector pointing &quot;against&quot; the object&#x27;s motion,
* formula_26 is the coefficient of kinetic friction, which is inside the integral because it may vary from location to location (e.g. if the material changes along the path),
* formula_40 is the position of the object.

Dissipation of energy by friction in a process is a classic example of thermodynamic irreversibility.

===Work of friction===
The work done by friction can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that can affect the contact surface properties (even the coefficient of friction between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in polishing. The work of friction is used to mix and join materials such as in the process of friction welding. Excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work due to frictional forces rise to unacceptable levels. Harder corrosion particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion (fretting) exacerbates wear of frictional forces. As surfaces are worn by work due to friction, fit and surface finish of an object may degrade until it no longer functions properly. For example, bearing seizure or failure may result from excessive wear due to work of friction.

In the reference frame of the interface between two surfaces, static friction does &quot;no&quot; work, because there is never displacement between the surfaces. In the same reference frame, kinetic friction is always in the direction opposite the motion, and does &quot;negative&quot; work. However, friction can do &quot;positive&quot; work in certain frames of reference. One can see this by placing a heavy box on a rug, then pulling on the rug quickly. In this case, the box slides backwards relative to the rug, but moves forward relative to the frame of reference in which the floor is stationary. Thus, the kinetic friction between the box and rug accelerates the box in the same direction that the box moves, doing &quot;positive&quot; work.

When sliding takes place between two rough bodies in contact, the algebraic sum of the works done is different from zero, and the algebraic sum of the quantities of heat gained by the two bodies is equal to the quantity of work lost by friction, and the total quantity of heat gained is positive. In a natural thermodynamic process, the work done by an agency in the surroundings of a thermodynamic system or working body is greater than the work received by the body, because of friction. Thermodynamic work is measured by changes in a body&#x27;s state variables, sometimes called work-like variables, other than temperature and entropy. Examples of work-like variables, which are ordinary macroscopic physical variables and which occur in conjugate pairs, are pressure – volume, and electric field – electric polarization. Temperature and entropy are a specifically thermodynamic conjugate pair of state variables. They can be affected microscopically at an atomic level, by mechanisms such as friction, thermal conduction, and radiation. The part of the work done by an agency in the surroundings that does not change the volume of the working body but is dissipated in friction, is called isochoric work. It is received as heat, by the working body and sometimes partly by a body in the surroundings. It is not counted as thermodynamic work received by the working body.

==Applications==
Friction is an important factor in many engineering disciplines.

===Transportation===
* Automobile brakes inherently rely on friction, slowing a vehicle by converting its kinetic energy into heat. Incidentally, dispersing this large amount of heat safely is one technical challenge in designing brake systems. Disk brakes rely on friction between a disc and brake pads that are squeezed transversely against the rotating disc. In drum brakes, brake shoes or pads are pressed outwards against a rotating cylinder (brake drum) to create friction. Since braking discs can be more efficiently cooled than drums, disc brakes have better stopping performance.
* Rail adhesion refers to the grip wheels of a train have on the rails, see Frictional contact mechanics.
* Road slipperiness is an important design and safety factor for automobiles
** Split friction is a particularly dangerous condition arising due to varying friction on either side of a car.
** Road texture affects the interaction of tires and the driving surface.

===Measurement===
* A tribometer is an instrument that measures friction on a surface.
* A profilograph is a device used to measure pavement surface roughness.

===Household usage===
* Friction is used to heat and ignite matchsticks (friction between the head of a matchstick and the rubbing surface of the match box).
* Sticky pads are used to prevent object from slipping off smooth surfaces by effectively increasing the friction coefficient between the surface and the object.

<text>Faith is confidence or trust in a person, thing, or concept. In the context of religion, faith is &quot;belief in God or in the doctrines or teachings of religion&quot;.
According to the Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Dictionary, faith has multiple definitions, including &quot;something that is believed especially with strong conviction&quot;, &quot;complete trust&quot;, &quot;belief and trust in and loyalty to God&quot;, as well as &quot;a firm belief in something for which there is no proof&quot;.

Religious people often think of faith as confidence based on a perceived degree of warrant, or evidence, while others who are more skeptical of religion tend to think of faith as simply belief without evidence.

In the Roman world, &#x27;faith&#x27; (Latin: ) was understood without particular association with gods or beliefs. Instead, it was understood as a paradoxical set of reciprocal ideas: voluntary will and voluntary restraint in the sense of father over family or host over guest, whereby one party willfully surrenders to a party who could harm but chooses not to, thereby entrusting or confiding in them.

According to Thomas Aquinas, faith is &quot;an act of the intellect assenting to the truth at the command of the will&quot;.

Religion has a long tradition, since the ancient world, of analyzing divine questions using common human experiences such as sensation, reason, science, and history that do not rely on revelation—called Natural theology.

== Etymology ==

The English word &quot;faith&quot; finds its roots in the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root *, signifying concepts of trust, confidence, and persuasion. This root has given rise to various terms across different languages, such as Greek (&quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;faith&quot;, and Latin , meaning &quot;trust&quot;, &quot;faith&quot;, &quot;confidence&quot;.

Furthermore, the Proto-Indo-European root * adds another layer to the word&#x27;s etymology, emphasizing the notions of truth and trustworthiness. This root is evident in English words like &quot;veracity&quot;, &quot;verity&quot;, and &quot;verify&quot;, as well as in Latin with , meaning &quot;true&quot;.

The term &quot;faith&quot; in English emerged in the mid-13th century, evolving from Anglo-French and Old French forms like and , ultimately tracing back to the Latin . This Latin term, rooted in the PIE root *, encompassed meanings such as &quot;trust&quot;, &quot;confidence&quot;, and &quot;belief&quot;.

== Religious faith ==
===Extent of religious faith===
Referring to &quot;religions&quot; (plural), Pope Francis claims that &quot;the majority of people living on our planet profess to be believers&quot;.

=== Christianity ===
The word translated as &quot;faith&quot; in English-language editions of the New Testament, the Greek word (), can also be translated as &quot;belief&quot;, &quot;faithfulness&quot;, or &quot;trust&quot;. Faith can also be translated from the Greek verb (), meaning &quot;to trust, to have confidence, faithfulness, to be reliable, to assure&quot;. Christianity encompasses various views regarding the nature of faith. Some see faith as being persuaded or convinced that something is true. In this view, a person believes something when they are presented with adequate evidence that it is true. The 13th-century theologian Saint Thomas Aquinas did not hold that faith is mere opinion: on the contrary, he held that it represents a mean (understood in the Aristotelian sense) between excessive reliance on science (i.e. demonstration) and excessive reliance on opinion.

According to Teresa Morgan, faith was understood by early Christians within the cultural milieu of the period as a relationship that created a community based on trust, instead of a set of mental beliefs or feelings of the heart.

Numerous commentators discuss the results of faith. Some believe that true faith results in good works, while others believe that while faith in Jesus brings eternal life, it does not necessarily result in good works.

Regardless of the approach taken to faith, all Christians agree that the Christian faith (in the sense of Christian practice) is aligned with the ideals and the example of the life of Jesus. The Christian contemplates the mystery of God and his grace and seeks to know and become obedient to God. To a Christian, the faith is not static, but causes one to learn more of God and to grow in faith; Christian faith has its origin in God.

In Christianity, faith causes change as it seeks a greater understanding of God. Faith is not fideism or simple obedience to a set of rules or statements. Before Christians have faith, but they must also understand in whom and in what they have faith. Without understanding, there cannot be true faith, and that understanding is built on the foundation of the community of believers, the scriptures and traditions, and on the personal experiences of the believer.

==== Strength of faith ====
Christians may recognize different degrees of faith when they encourage each other to, and themselves strive to, develop, grow, and/or deepen their faith.
This may imply that one can measure faith. Willingness to undergo martyrdom indicates a proxy for depth of faith but does not provide an everyday measurement for the average contemporary Christian. Within the Calvinist tradition the degree of prosperity may serve as an analog of the level of faith.
Other Christian strands may rely on personal self-evaluation to measure the intensity of an individual&#x27;s faith, with associated difficulties in calibrating to any scale. Solemn affirmations of a creed (a statement of faith) provide Various tribunals of the Inquisition, however, concerned themselves with precisely evaluating the orthodoxy of the faith of those it examined – to acquit or to punish in varying degrees.

The classification of different degrees of faith allows that faith and its expression may wax and wane in fervor—during the lifetime of a faithful individual and/or over the various historical centuries of a society with an embedded religious system. Thus, one can speak of an &quot;Age of Faith&quot;
or of the &quot;decay&quot; of a society&#x27;s religiosity into corruption,
secularism,
or atheism,—interpretable as the ultimate loss of faith.

==== Christian apologetic views ====
In contrast to Richard Dawkins&#x27; view of faith as &quot;blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence&quot;, Alister McGrath quotes the Oxford Anglican theologian W. H. Griffith Thomas (1861–1924), who states that faith is &quot;not blind, but intelligent&quot; and that it &quot;commences with the conviction of the mind based on adequate evidence...&quot;, which McGrath sees as &quot;a good and reliable definition, synthesizing the core elements of the characteristic Christian understanding of faith&quot;.

American biblical scholar Archibald Thomas Robertson (1863–1934) stated that the Greek word used for &quot;faith&quot; in the New Testament (over two hundred forty times), and rendered &quot;assurance&quot; in , is &quot;an old verb meaning &#x27;to furnish&#x27;, used regularly by Demosthenes for bringing forward evidence.&quot; Tom Price (Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics) affirms that when the New Testament talks about faith positively it only uses words derived from the Greek root [] which means &quot;to be persuaded&quot;.

British Christian apologist John Lennox argues that &quot;faith conceived as a belief that lacks warrant is very different from faith conceived as a belief that has warrant&quot;. He states that &quot;the use of the adjective &#x27;blind&#x27; to describe &#x27;faith&#x27; indicates that faith is not necessarily, or always, or indeed normally, blind&quot;. &quot;The validity, or warrant, of faith or belief depends on the strength of the evidence on which the belief is based.&quot; &quot;We all know how to distinguish between blind faith and evidence-based faith. We are well aware that faith is only justified if there is evidence to back it up.&quot; &quot;Evidence-based faith is the normal concept on which we base our everyday lives.&quot;

Peter S. Williams holds that &quot;the classic Christian tradition has always valued rationality and does not hold that faith involves the complete abandonment of reason while believing in the teeth of evidence&quot;. Quoting Moreland, faith is defined as &quot;a trust in and commitment to what we have reason to believe is true&quot;.

Regarding doubting Thomas in , Williams points out that &quot;Thomas wasn&#x27;t asked to believe without evidence&quot;. He was asked to believe based on the other disciples&#x27; testimony. Thomas initially lacked the first-hand experience of the evidence that had convinced them... Moreover, the reason John gives for recounting these events is that what he saw is evidence... Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples... But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name. .&quot;

Concerning doubting Thomas, Michael R. Allen wrote: &quot;Thomas&#x27;s definition of faith implies adherence to conceptual propositions for the sake of personal knowledge, knowledge of and about a person &quot;qua&quot; person&quot;.

Kenneth Boa and Robert M. Bowman Jr. describe a classic understanding of faith that is referred to as &quot;evidentialism&quot;, and which is part of a larger epistemological tradition called &quot;classical foundationalism&quot;, which is accompanied by &quot;deontologism&quot;, which holds that humans must regulate their beliefs following evidentialist structures. They show how this can go too far, and Alvin Plantinga While Plantinga upholds that faith may be the result of evidence testifying to the reliability of the source (of the truth claims), yet he sees having faith as being the result of hearing the truth of the gospel with the internal persuasion by the Holy Spirit moving and enabling him to believe. &quot;Christian belief is produced in the believer by the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, endorsing the teachings of Scripture, which is itself divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit. The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is faith.&quot;

==== Catholicism ====

The four-part &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; (CCC) gives Part One to &quot;The Profession of Faith&quot;. This section describes the content of faith. It elaborates and expands, particularly upon the Apostles&#x27; Creed. CCC 144 initiates a section on the &quot;Obedience of Faith&quot;.

In the theology of Pope John Paul II, faith is understood in personal terms as a trusting commitment of person to person and thus involves Christian commitment to the divine person of Jesus Christ.

==== Methodism ====
In Methodism, faith plays an important role in justification, which occurs during the New Birth. The Emmanuel Association, a Methodist denomination in the conservative holiness movement, teaches:
==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====

The Articles of Faith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints states that &quot;faith in the Lord Jesus Christ&quot; is the first principle of the gospel.

Some alternative, yet impactful, ideas regarding the nature of faith were presented by church founder Joseph Smith in a collection of sermons, which are now published as the &quot;Lectures on Faith&quot;.

* Lecture 1 explains what faith is;
* Lecture 2 describes how mankind comes to know about God;
* Lectures 3 and 4 make clear the necessary and unchanging attributes of God;
* Lecture 5 deals with the nature of God the Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost;
* Lecture 6 proclaims that the willingness to sacrifice all earthly things is a prerequisite to gaining faith in salvation;
* Lecture 7 treats the fruits of faith—perspective, power, and eventually perfection.

=== Buddhism ===

Faith in Buddhism (, ) refers to a serene commitment to the practice of the Buddha&#x27;s teaching and trust in enlightened or highly developed beings, such as Buddhas or &quot;bodhisattvas&quot; (those aiming to become a Buddha). Buddhists usually recognize multiple objects of faith, but many are especially devoted to one particular object of faith, such as one particular Buddha.

In early Buddhism, faith was focused on the Three Jewels or Refuges, namely, Gautama Buddha, his teaching (the &quot;Dhamma&quot;), and the community of spiritually developed followers, or the monastic community seeking enlightenment (the &quot;Sangha&quot;). Although offerings to the monastic community were valued highest, early Buddhism did not morally condemn peaceful offerings to deities. A faithful devotee was called &quot;upāsaka&quot; or &quot;upāsika&quot;, for which no formal declaration was required. In early Buddhism, personal verification was valued highest in attaining the truth, and sacred scriptures, reason, or faith in a teacher were considered less valuable sources of authority. As important as faith was, it was a mere initial step to the path to wisdom and enlightenment, and was obsolete or redefined at the final stage of that path.

While faith in Buddhism does not imply &quot;blind faith&quot;, Buddhist practice nevertheless requires a degree of trust, primarily in the spiritual attainment of Gautama Buddha. Faith in Buddhism can still be described as faith in the Three Jewels (the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha). It is intended to lead to the goal of enlightenment, or &quot;bodhi&quot;, and &quot;Nirvana&quot;. Volitionally, faith implies a resolute and courageous act of will. It combines the steadfast resolution that one will do a thing with the self-confidence that one can do it.

In the later stratum of Buddhist history, especially Mahāyāna Buddhism, faith was given a much more important role. The concept of the Buddha Nature was developed, as devotion to Buddhas and &quot;bodhisattvas&quot; residing in Pure Lands became commonplace. With the arising of the cult of the Lotus Sūtra, faith gained a central role in Buddhist practice, which was further amplified with the development of devotion to the Amitabha Buddha in Pure Land Buddhism. In the Japanese form of Pure Land Buddhism, under the teachers Hōnen and Shinran, only entrusting faith toward the Amitabha Buddha was believed to be a fruitful form of practice, as the practice of celibacy, morality, and other Buddhist disciplines were dismissed as no longer effective in this day and age, or as contradicting the virtue of faith. Faith was defined as a state similar to enlightenment, with a sense of self-negation and humility.

Thus, the role of faith increased throughout Buddhist history. However, from the nineteenth century onward, Buddhist modernism in countries like Sri Lanka and Japan, and also in the West, has downplayed and criticized the role of faith in Buddhism. Faith in Buddhism still has a role in modern Asia and the West but is understood and defined differently than in traditional interpretations. Within the Dalit Buddhist Movement communities, taking refuge is defined not only as a religious, but also a political choice.

=== Hinduism ===

Bhakti () literally means &quot;attachment, participation, fondness for, homage, faith, love, devotion, worship, purity&quot;. It was originally used in Hinduism, referring to devotion and love for a personal god or a representational god by a devotee. In ancient texts such as the &quot;Shvetashvatara Upanishad&quot;, the term simply means participation, devotion, and love for any endeavor, while in the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, it connotes one of the possible paths of spirituality and towards moksha, as in .

Ahimsa, also referred to as nonviolence, is a fundamental tenet of Hinduism that advocates harmonious and peaceful co-existence and evolutionary growth in grace and wisdom for all humankind unconditionally.

In Hinduism, most of the Vedic prayers begins with the chants of Om. Om is the Sanskrit symbol that amazingly resonates the peacefulness ensconced within one&#x27;s higher self. Om is considered to have a profound effect on the body and mind of the one who chants and also creates a calmness, serenity, healing, strength of its own to prevail within and also in the surrounding environment.

=== Islam ===

In Islam, a believer&#x27;s faith in the metaphysical aspects of Islam is called (), which is complete submission to the will of God, not unquestioning or blind belief. A man must build his faith on well-grounded convictions beyond any reasonable doubt and above uncertainty. According to the Quran, must be accompanied by righteous deeds and the two together are necessary for entry into Paradise. In the Hadith of Gabriel, in addition to &quot;Islam&quot; and form the three dimensions of the Islamic religion.

Muhammad referred to the six axioms of faith in the Hadith of Gabriel: &quot; is that you believe in God and His Angels and His Books and His Messengers and the Hereafter and the good and evil fate [ordained by your God].&quot; The first five are mentioned together in the Qur&#x27;an. The Quran states that faith can grow with remembrance of God. The Qur&#x27;an also states that nothing in this world should be dearer to a true believer than faith.

=== Judaism ===
Judaism recognizes the positive value of (generally translated as &quot;faith&quot;, or &quot;trust in God&quot;) and the negative status of the (heretic), but faith is not as stressed or as central as it is in some other religions, especially Christianity or Islam. Faith could be a necessary means for being a practicing religious Jew, but the emphasis is placed on true knowledge, true prophecy, and practice rather than on faith itself. Very rarely does it relate to any teaching that must be believed. Judaism does not require one to explicitly identify God (a key tenet of Christian faith, which is called Avodah Zarah (foreign worship) in Judaism, a minor form of idol worship, a big sin and strictly forbidden to Jews). Rather, in Judaism, one is to honor a (personal) idea of God, supported by the many principles quoted in the Talmud to define Judaism, mostly by what it is not. Thus there is no established formulation of Jewish principles of faith which are mandatory for all (observant) Jews.

In the Jewish scriptures, trust in God – – refers to how God acts toward his people and how they are to respond to him; it is rooted in the everlasting covenant established in the Torah, notably Deuteronomy 7:9:

The specific tenets that compose required belief and their application to the times have been disputed throughout Jewish history. Today many, but not all, Orthodox Jews have accepted Maimonides&#x27;s Thirteen Principles of Belief.

A traditional example of as seen in the Jewish annals is found in the person of Abraham. On several occasions, Abraham both accepts statements from God that seem impossible and offers obedient actions in response to direction from God to do things that seem implausible.

The Talmud describes how a thief also believes in G‑d: On the brink of his forced entry, as he is about to risk his life—and the life of his victim—he cries out with all sincerity, &quot;G‑d help me!&quot; The thief has faith that there is a G‑d who hears his cries, yet it escapes him that this G‑d may be able to provide for him without requiring that he abrogate G‑d&#x27;s will by stealing from others. For to affect him in this way he needs study and contemplation.

=== Sikhism ===

Faith is not a religious concept in Sikhism. However, the five Sikh symbols, known as Kakaars or Five Ks (in Punjabi known as or ), are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Five articles of Faith&quot;. The articles include (uncut hair), (small wooden comb), (circular steel or iron bracelet), (sword/dagger), and (special undergarment). Baptised Sikhs are bound to wear those five articles of faith, at all times, to save them from bad company and keep them close to God.

=== Baháʼí Faith ===
In the Baháʼí Faith, faith is meant, first, as conscious knowledge, second, as the practice of good deeds, and ultimately as the acceptance of the divine authority of the Manifestations of God. In the religion&#x27;s view, faith and knowledge are both required for spiritual growth. Faith involves more than outward obedience to this authority, but also must be based on a deep personal understanding of religious teachings.

== Secular faith ==

Secular faith refers to a belief or conviction that is not based on religious or supernatural doctrines. Secular faith can arise from a wide range of sources and can take many forms, depending on the individual&#x27;s beliefs and experiences, including:

; Philosophy: Many secular beliefs are rooted in philosophical ideas, such as humanism or rationalism. These belief systems often emphasize the importance of reason, ethics, and human agency, rather than relying on supernatural or religious explanations. A prime example is the philosopher Immanuel Kant, whose deontological ethical theory has profoundly shaped western secular values from the 18th century onward. He professed a secular faith in reason, writing in the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals that &quot;the true vocation of reason must be to produce a will that is good, not perhaps as a means to other purposes, but good in itself, for which reason was absolutely necessary. This will need not, because of this, be the sole and complete good, but it must still be the highest good and the condition of every other, even of all demands for happiness.&quot;
; Personal values and principles: People may develop secular faith based on their own values and principles, such as a belief in social justice or environmentalism.
; Community and culture: Secular faith can also be influenced by the values and beliefs of a particular community or culture. For example, some people may have faith in the principles of democracy, human rights, or freedom of expression.

== Epistemological analysis ==
The epistemological study focuses on epistemic justification, the rationality of belief, and various related issues. A justified belief is a belief that is well-supported by evidence and reasons, and that is arrived at through a reliable and trustworthy process of inquiry.

Faith is often regarded as a form of belief that may not necessarily rely on empirical evidence. However, when religious faith does make empirical claims, these claims need to undergo scientific testing to determine their validity. On the other hand, some beliefs may not make empirical claims and instead focus on non-empirical issues such as ethics, morality, and spiritual practices. In these cases, it may be necessary to evaluate the validity of these beliefs based on their internal coherence and logical consistency, rather than empirical testing.

There is a wide spectrum of opinion concerning the epistemological validity of faith — that is, whether it is a reliable way to acquire true beliefs.

=== Fideism ===

Fideism is considered to be a philosophical position rather than a comprehensive epistemological theory. It maintains that faith is independent of reason, or that reason and faith are hostile to each other and faith is superior at arriving at particular truths (see natural theology). Fideism is not a synonym for religious belief but describes a particular philosophical proposition concerning the relationship between faith&#x27;s appropriate jurisdiction at arriving at truths, contrasted against reason. It states that faith is needed to determine some philosophical and religious truths, and it questions the ability of reason to arrive at all truth. The word and concept had its origin in the mid to late-19th century by way of Catholic thought, in a movement called Traditionalism. The Roman Catholic Magisterium has, however, repeatedly condemned fideism.

Critics of fideism suggest that it is not a justified or rational position from an epistemological standpoint. Fideism holds that religious beliefs cannot be justified or evaluated based on evidence or reason and that faith alone is a sufficient basis for belief. This position has been criticized because it leads to dogmatism, irrationality, and a rejection of the importance of reason and evidence in understanding the world.

William Alston argues that while faith is an important aspect of religious belief, it must be grounded in reason and evidence to be justified.

=== Religious epistemology ===

Religious epistemologists formulated and defended reasons for the rationality of accepting belief in God without the support of an argument. Some religious epistemologists hold that belief in God is more analogous to belief in a person than belief in a scientific hypothesis. Human relations demand trust and commitment. If belief in God is more like belief in other persons, then the trust that is appropriate to persons will be appropriate to God. American psychologist and philosopher William James offers a similar argument in his lecture &quot;The Will to Believe&quot;.

Foundationalism is a view about the structure of justification or knowledge. Foundationalism holds that all knowledge and justified belief are ultimately based upon what are called properly basic beliefs. This position is intended to resolve the infinite regress problem in epistemology. According to foundationalism, a belief is epistemically justified only if it is justified by properly basic beliefs. One of the significant developments in foundationalism is the rise of reformed epistemology.

Reformed epistemology is a view about the epistemology of religious belief, which holds that belief in God can be properly basic. Analytic philosophers Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff develop this view. Plantinga holds that a person may rationally believe in God even though the person does not possess sufficient evidence to convince an agnostic. One difference between reformed epistemology and fideism is that the former requires defense against known objections, whereas the latter might dismiss such objections as irrelevant. Plantinga developed reformed epistemology in &quot;Warranted Christian Belief&quot; as a form of externalism that holds that the justification-conferring factors for a belief may include external factors.

Some theistic philosophers have defended theism by granting evidentialism but supporting theism through deductive arguments whose premises are considered justifiable. Some of these arguments are probabilistic, either in the sense of having weight but being inconclusive or in the sense of having a mathematical probability assigned to them. Notable in this regard are the cumulative arguments presented by British philosopher Basil Mitchell and analytic philosopher Richard Swinburne, whose arguments are based on Bayesian probability. In a notable exposition of his arguments, Swinburne appeals to an inference for the best explanation.

Professor of Mathematics and philosopher of science at University of Oxford John Lennox justifies his religious belief in Jesus&#x27;s resurrection and miracles by believing God&#x27;s capability of breaking the commonly recognized law of nature. John Lennox has stated, &quot;Faith is not a leap in the dark; it&#x27;s the exact opposite. It&#x27;s a commitment based on evidence… It is irrational to reduce all faith to blind faith and then subject it to ridicule. That provides a very anti-intellectual and convenient way of avoiding intelligent discussion.&quot; He criticises Richard Dawkins as a famous proponent of asserting that faith equates to holding a belief without evidence, thus that it is possible to hold belief without evidence, for failing to provide evidence for this assertion.

Critics of reformed epistemology argue that it fails to provide a compelling justification for belief in God and that it is unable to account for the diversity of religious belief and experience. They also argue that it can lead to a kind of epistemic relativism, in which all religious beliefs are considered equally valid and justified, regardless of their content or coherence. Despite these criticisms, reformed epistemology has been influential in the contemporary philosophy of religion and continues to be an active area of debate and discussion.

=== Empirical claims ===
Many religious beliefs are intended to be metaphorical or symbolic, but there are also religious beliefs that are taken quite literally by believers. For example, some Christians believe that the Earth was created in six literal days, and some Muslims believe that the Quran contains scientific facts that were not known to humans at the time of its revelation. Furthermore, even if a religious belief is intended to be metaphorical or symbolic, it can still be subject to empirical testing if it makes claims about the world. For example, the claim that the Earth is the center of the universe can be interpreted as a metaphorical representation of humanity&#x27;s special place in the cosmos, but it also makes an empirical claim that can be tested by scientific observation.

=== Morality and faith ===

From a scientific perspective, morality is not dependent on faith. While some individuals may claim that their morality is rooted in their faith or religious beliefs, there is evidence to suggest that morality is also influenced by other factors, such as social and cultural norms, empathy, and reason. Studies have shown that individuals from diverse cultural and religious backgrounds tend to share many moral values, suggesting that morality is not solely dependent on faith. Additionally, research in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology has shed light on the biological and cognitive mechanisms underlying moral decision-making, providing further evidence that morality is not exclusively dependent on faith.

=== Criticism ===

Bertrand Russell wrote:

Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins criticizes all faith by generalizing from specific faith in propositions that conflict directly with scientific evidence. He describes faith as belief without evidence; a process of active non-thinking. He states that it is a practice that only degrades our understanding of the natural world by allowing anyone to make a claim about nature that is based solely on their personal thoughts, and possibly distorted perceptions, that does not require testing against nature, cannot make reliable and consistent predictions, and is not subject to peer review.

Philosophy professor Peter Boghossian argues that reason and evidence are the only way to determine which &quot;claims about the world are likely true&quot;. Different religious traditions make different religious claims, and Boghossian asserts that faith alone cannot resolve conflicts between these without evidence. He gives an example of the belief held by Muslims that Muhammad (who died in the year 632) was the last prophet, and the contradictory belief held by Mormons that Joseph Smith (born in 1805) was a prophet. Boghossian asserts that faith has no &quot;built-in corrective mechanism&quot;. For factual claims, he gives the example of the belief that the Earth is 4,000 years old. With only faith and no reason or evidence, he argues, there is no way to correct this claim if it is inaccurate. Boghossian advocates thinking of faith either as &quot;belief without evidence&quot; or &quot;pretending to know things you don&#x27;t know&quot;.

Friedrich Nietzsche expressed his criticism of the Christian idea of faith in passage 51 of The Antichrist: The fact that faith, under certain circumstances, may work for blessedness, but that this blessedness produced by an idée fixe by no means makes the idea itself true, and the fact that faith actually moves no mountains, but instead raises them up where there were none before: all this is made sufficiently clear by a walk through a lunatic asylum. Not, of course, to a priest: for his instincts prompt him to the lie that sickness is not sickness and lunatic asylums not lunatic asylums. Christianity finds sickness necessary, just as the Greek spirit had need of a superabundance of health—the actual ulterior purpose of the whole system of salvation of the church is to make people ill. And the church itself—doesn&#x27;t it set up a Catholic lunatic asylum as the ultimate ideal?—The whole earth as a madhouse?—The sort of religious man that the church wants is a typical décadent; the moment at which a religious crisis dominates a people is always marked by epidemics of nervous disorder; the &quot;inner world&quot; of the religious man is so much like the &quot;inner world&quot; of the overstrung and exhausted that it is difficult to distinguish between them; the &quot;highest&quot; states of mind, held up before mankind by Christianity as of supreme worth, are actually epileptoid in form—the church has granted the name of holy only to lunatics or to gigantic frauds in majorem dei honorem...

Gustave Le Bon emphasizes the irrational nature of faith and suggests that it is often based on emotions rather than reason. He argues that faith can be used to manipulate and control people, particularly in the context of religious or political movements. In this sense, Le Bon views faith as a tool that can be wielded by those in power to shape the beliefs and behaviors of the masses.

Faith as in &#x27;strong unshakable faith&#x27; is considered a virtue by many religious believers. This has been criticized since beliefs, including religious beliefs, should not be &quot;exempt from critical evaluation&quot; even if questioning or reconsidering these is difficult.

<doc id="11090" wikidata="Q4421" url="?curid=11090" title="Forest">
<text>A forest is an ecosystem characterized by a dense community of trees. Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing, and ecological function. The United Nations&#x27; Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines a forest as, &quot;Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds &quot;in situ&quot;. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban use.&quot; Using this definition, &quot;Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020&quot; found that forests covered , or approximately 31 percent of the world&#x27;s land area in 2020.

Forests are the largest terrestrial ecosystems of Earth by area, and are found around the globe. 45 percent of forest land is in the tropical latitudes. The next largest share of forests are found in subarctic climates, followed by temperate, and subtropical zones.

Forests account for 75% of the gross primary production of the Earth&#x27;s biosphere, and contain 80% of the Earth&#x27;s plant biomass. Net primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes of biomass per year for tropical forests, 8.1 for temperate forests, and 2.6 for boreal forests.

Forests form distinctly different biomes at different latitudes and elevations, and with different precipitation and evapotranspiration rates. These biomes include boreal forests in subarctic climates, tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests around the Equator, and temperate forests at the middle latitudes. Forests form in areas of the Earth with high rainfall, while drier conditions produce a transition to savanna. However, in areas with intermediate rainfall levels, forest transitions to savanna rapidly when the percentage of land that is covered by trees drops below 40 to 45 percent. Research conducted in the Amazon rainforest shows that trees can alter rainfall rates across a region, releasing water from their leaves in anticipation of seasonal rains to trigger the wet season early. Because of this, seasonal rainfall in the Amazon begins two to three months earlier than the climate would otherwise allow. Deforestation in the Amazon and anthropogenic climate change hold the potential to interfere with this process, causing the forest to pass a threshold where it transitions into savanna.

Deforestation threatens many forest ecosystems. Deforestation occurs when humans remove trees from a forested area by cutting or burning, either to harvest timber or to make way for farming. Most deforestation today occurs in tropical forests. The vast majority of this deforestation is because of the production of four commodities: wood, beef, soy, and palm oil. Over the past 2,000 years, the area of land covered by forest in Europe has been reduced from 80% to 34%. Large areas of forest have also been cleared in China and in the eastern United States, in which only 0.1% of land was left undisturbed. Almost half of Earth&#x27;s forest area (49 percent) is relatively intact, while 9 percent is found in fragments with little or no connectivity. Tropical rainforests and boreal coniferous forests are the least fragmented, whereas subtropical dry forests and temperate oceanic forests are among the most fragmented. Roughly 80 percent of the world&#x27;s forest area is found in patches larger than . The remaining 20 percent is located in more than 34 million patches around the world – the vast majority less than in size.

Human society and forests can affect one another positively or negatively. Forests provide ecosystem services to humans and serve as tourist attractions. Forests can also affect people&#x27;s health. Human activities, including unsustainable use of forest resources, can negatively affect forest ecosystems.

== Definitions ==
Although the word &quot;forest&quot; is commonly used, there is no universally recognised precise definition, with more than 800 definitions of forest used around the world. Although a forest is usually defined by the presence of trees, under many definitions an area completely lacking trees may still be considered a forest if it grew trees in the past, will grow trees in the future, or was legally designated as a forest regardless of vegetation type.

There are three broad categories of definitions of forest in use: administrative, land use, and land cover. Administrative definitions are legal designations, and may not reflect the type of vegetation that grows upon the land; an area can be legally designated &quot;forest&quot; even if no trees grow on it. Land-use definitions are based on the primary purpose the land is used for. Under a land-use definition, any area used primarily for harvesting timber, including areas that have been cleared by harvesting, disease, fire, or for the construction of roads and infrastructure, are still defined as forests, even if they contain no trees. Land-cover definitions define forests based upon the density of trees, area of tree canopy cover, or area of the land occupied by the cross-section of tree trunks (basal area) meeting a particular threshold. This type of definition depends upon the presence of trees sufficient to meet the threshold, or at least of immature trees that are expected to meet the threshold once they mature.

Under land-cover definitions, there is considerable variation on where the cutoff points are between a forest, woodland, and savanna. Under some definitions, to be considered a forest requires very high levels of tree canopy cover, from 60% to 100%, which excludes woodlands and savannas, which have a lower canopy cover. Other definitions consider savannas to be a type of forest, and include all areas with tree canopies over 10%.

Some areas covered with trees are legally defined as agricultural areas, for example Norway spruce plantations, under Austrian forest law, when the trees are being grown as Christmas trees and are below a certain height.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;&quot; derives from the Old French &quot;forest&quot; (also &quot;forès&quot;), denoting &quot;forest, vast expanse covered by trees&quot;; &quot;forest&quot; was first introduced into English as the word denoting wild land set aside for hunting without necessarily having trees on the land. Possibly a borrowing, probably via Frankish or Old High German, of the Medieval Latin , denoting &quot;open wood&quot;, Carolingian scribes first used &quot;foresta&quot; in the capitularies of Charlemagne, specifically to denote the royal hunting grounds of the king. The word was not endemic to the Romance languages, e.g., native words for &quot;forest&quot; in the Romance languages derived from the Latin &quot;silva&quot;, which denoted &quot;forest&quot; and &quot;wood(land)&quot; (cf. the English &quot;sylva&quot; and &quot;sylvan&quot;; the Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese &quot;selva&quot;; the Romanian &quot;silvă&quot;; the Old French &quot;selve&quot;). Cognates of forest in Romance languages—e.g., the Italian &quot;foresta&quot;, Spanish and Portuguese &quot;floresta&quot;, etc.—are all ultimately derivations of the French word.

The precise origin of Medieval Latin is obscure. Some authorities claim the word derives from the Late Latin phrase &quot;forestam silvam&quot;, denoting &quot;the outer wood&quot;; others claim the word is a Latinisation of the Frankish *&quot;forhist&quot;, denoting &quot;forest, wooded country&quot;, and was assimilated to &quot;forestam silvam&quot;, pursuant to the common practice of Frankish scribes. The Old High German &quot;forst&quot; denoting &quot;forest&quot;; Middle Low German &quot;vorst&quot; denoting &quot;forest&quot;; Old English &quot;fyrhþ&quot; denoting &quot;forest, woodland, game preserve, hunting ground&quot; (English &quot;&quot;); and Old Norse &quot;fýri&quot;, denoting &quot;coniferous forest&quot;; all of which derive from the Proto-Germanic *&quot;furhísa-&quot;, *&quot;furhíþija-&quot;, denoting &quot;a fir-wood, &quot;coniferous&quot; forest&quot;, from the Proto-Indo-European *&quot;perkwu-&quot;, denoting &quot;a &quot;coniferous&quot; or mountain forest, wooded height&quot; all attest to the Frankish *&quot;forhist&quot;.

Uses of &quot;forest&quot; in English to denote any uninhabited and unenclosed area are presently considered archaic. The Norman rulers of England introduced the word as a legal term, as seen in Latin texts such as Magna Carta, to denote uncultivated land that was legally designated for hunting by feudal nobility (see royal forest).

These hunting forests did not necessarily contain any trees. Because that often included significant areas of woodland, &quot;forest&quot; eventually came to connote woodland in general, regardless of tree density. By the beginning of the fourteenth century, English texts used the word in all three of its senses: common, legal, and archaic. Other English words used to denote &quot;an area with a high density of trees&quot; are &quot;firth&quot;, &quot;frith&quot;, &quot;holt&quot;, &quot;weald&quot;, &quot;wold&quot;, &quot;wood&quot;, and &quot;woodland&quot;. Unlike &quot;forest&quot;, these are all derived from Old English and were not borrowed from another language. Some present classifications reserve &quot;woodland&quot; for denoting a locale with more open space between trees, and distinguish kinds of woodlands as &quot;open forests&quot; and &quot;closed forests&quot;, premised on their crown covers. Finally, &quot;sylva&quot; (plural &quot;sylvae&quot; or, less classically, &quot;sylvas&quot;) is a peculiar English spelling of the Latin &quot;silva&quot;, denoting a &quot;woodland&quot;, and has precedent in English, including its plural forms. While its use as a synonym of &quot;forest&quot;, and as a Latinate word denoting a woodland, may be admitted; in a specific technical sense it is restricted to denoting the &quot;species&quot; of trees that comprise the woodlands of a region, as in its sense in the subject of silviculture. The resorting to &quot;sylva&quot; in English indicates more precisely the denotation that the use of &quot;forest&quot; intends.

== Evolutionary history ==
The first known forests on Earth arose in the Middle Devonian (approximately 390 million years ago), with the evolution of cladoxylopsid plants like &quot;Calamophyton&quot;. Appeared in the Late Devonian, &quot;Archaeopteris&quot; was both tree-like and fern-like plant, growing to in height or more. It quickly spread throughout the world, from the equator to subpolar latitudes. It is the first species known to cast shade due to its fronds and forming soil from its roots. &quot;Archaeopteris&quot; was deciduous, dropping its fronds onto the forest floor, the shade, soil, and forest duff from the dropped fronds creating the early forest. The shed organic matter altered the freshwater environment, slowing its flow and providing food. This promoted freshwater fish.

== Ecology ==

Forests account for 75% of the gross primary productivity of the Earth&#x27;s biosphere, and contain 80% of the Earth&#x27;s plant biomass. Biomass per unit area is high compared to other vegetation communities. Much of this biomass occurs below ground in the root systems and as partially decomposed plant detritus. The woody component of a forest contains lignin, which is relatively slow to decompose compared with other organic materials such as cellulose or carbohydrate. The world&#x27;s forests contain about 606 gigatonnes of living biomass (above- and below-ground) and 59 gigatonnes of dead wood. The total biomass has decreased slightly since 1990, but biomass per unit area has increased.

Forest ecosystems broadly differ based on climate; latitudes 10° north and south of the equator are mostly covered in tropical rainforest, and the latitudes between 53°N and 67°N have boreal forest. As a general rule, forests dominated by angiosperms (&quot;broadleaf forests&quot;) are more species-rich than those dominated by gymnosperms (&quot;conifer&quot;, &quot;montane&quot;, or &quot;needleleaf forests&quot;), although exceptions exist. The trees that form the principal structural and defining component of a forest may be of a great variety of species (as in tropical rainforests and temperate deciduous forests), or relatively few species over large areas (e.g., taiga and arid montane coniferous forests). The biodiversity of forests also encompasses shrubs, herbaceous plants, mosses, ferns, lichens, fungi, and a variety of animals.

Trees rising up to in height add a vertical dimension to the area of land that can support plant and animal species, opening up numerous ecological niches for arboreal animal species, epiphytes, and various species that thrive under the regulated microclimate created under the canopy. Forests have intricate three-dimensional structures that increase in complexity with lower levels of disturbance and greater variety of tree species.

The biodiversity of forests varies considerably according to factors such as forest type, geography, climate, and soils – in addition to human use. Most forest habitats in temperate regions support relatively few animal and plant species, and species that tend to have large geographical distributions, while the montane forests of Africa, South America, Southeast Asia, and lowland forests of Australia, coastal Brazil, the Caribbean islands, Central America, and insular Southeast Asia have many species with small geographical distributions. Areas with dense human populations and intense agricultural land use, such as Europe, parts of Bangladesh, China, India, and North America, are less intact in terms of their biodiversity. Northern Africa, southern Australia, coastal Brazil, Madagascar, and South Africa are also identified as areas with striking losses in biodiversity intactness.

=== Components ===
A forest consists of many components that can be broadly divided into two categories: biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living). The living parts include trees, shrubs, vines, grasses and other herbaceous (non-woody) plants, mosses, algae, fungi, insects, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and microorganisms living on the plants and animals and in the soil, connected by mycorrhizal networks.

===Layers===
The main layers of all forest types are the forest floor, the understory, and the canopy. The emergent layer, above the canopy, exists in tropical rainforests. Each layer has a different set of plants and animals, depending upon the availability of sunlight, moisture, and food.
* The Forest floor is covered in dead plant material such as fallen leaves and decomposing logs, which detritivores break down into new soil. The layer of decaying leaves that covers the soil is necessary for many insects to overwinter and for amphibians, birds, and other animals to shelter and forage for food. Leaf litter also keeps the soil moist, stops erosion, and protects roots against extreme heat and cold. The fungal mycelium that helps form the mycorrhizal network transmits nutrients from decaying material to trees and other plants. The forest floor supports a variety of plants, ferns, grasses, and tree seedlings, as well as animals such as ants, amphibians, spiders, and millipedes. 
* Understory is made up of bushes, shrubs, and young trees that are adapted to living in the shade of the canopy.
* Canopy is formed by the mass of intertwined branches, twigs, and leaves of mature trees. The crowns of the dominant trees receive most of the sunlight. This is the most productive part of the trees, where maximum food is produced. The canopy forms a shady, protective &quot;umbrella&quot; over the rest of the forest.
* Emergent layer exists in a tropical rain forest and is composed of a few scattered trees that tower over the canopy.

In botany and countries like Germany and Poland, a different classification of forest vegetation is often used: tree, shrub, herb, and moss layers (see stratification (vegetation)).

=== Types ===

Forests are classified differently and to different degrees of specificity. One such classification is in terms of the biomes in which they exist, combined with leaf longevity of the dominant species (whether they are evergreen or deciduous). Another distinction is whether the forests are composed predominantly of broadleaf trees, coniferous (needle-leaved) trees, or mixed.
* Boreal forests occupy the subarctic zone and are generally evergreen and coniferous.
* Temperate zones support both broadleaf deciduous forests (e.g., temperate deciduous forest) and evergreen coniferous forests (e.g., temperate coniferous forests and temperate rainforests). Warm temperate zones support broadleaf evergreen forests, including laurel forests.
* Tropical and subtropical forests include tropical and subtropical moist forests, tropical and subtropical dry forests, and tropical and subtropical coniferous forests.
* Forests are classified according to physiognomy based on their overall physical structure or developmental stage (e.g. old growth vs. second growth).
* Forests can also be classified more specifically based on the climate and the dominant tree species present, resulting in numerous different forest types (e.g., Ponderosa pine/Douglas fir forest).

The number of trees in the world, according to a 2015 estimate, is 3 trillion, of which 1.4 trillion are in the tropics or sub-tropics, 0.6 trillion in the temperate zones, and 0.7 trillion in the coniferous boreal forests. The 2015 estimate is about eight times higher than previous estimates, and is based on tree densities measured on over 400,000 plots. It remains subject to a wide margin of error, not least because the samples are mainly from Europe and North America.

Forests can also be classified according to the amount of human alteration. Old-growth forest contains mainly natural patterns of biodiversity in established seral patterns, and they contain mainly species native to the region and habitat. In contrast, secondary forest is forest regrowing following timber harvest and may contain species originally from other regions or habitats.

Different global forest classification systems have been proposed, but none has gained universal acceptance. UNEP-WCMC&#x27;s forest category classification system is a simplification of other, more complex systems (e.g. UNESCO&#x27;s forest and woodland &#x27;subformations&#x27;). This system divides the world&#x27;s forests into 26 major types, which reflect climatic zones as well as the principal types of trees. These 26 major types can be reclassified into 6 broader categories: temperate needleleaf, temperate broadleaf and mixed, tropical moist, tropical dry, sparse trees and parkland, and forest plantations. Each category is described in a separate section below.

==== Temperate needleleaf ====
Temperate needleleaf forests mostly occupy the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, as well as some warm temperate areas, especially on nutrient-poor or otherwise unfavourable soils. These forests are composed entirely, or nearly so, of coniferous species (Coniferophyta). In the Northern Hemisphere, pines &quot;Pinus&quot;, spruces &quot;Picea&quot;, larches &quot;Larix&quot;, firs &quot;Abies&quot;, Douglas firs &quot;Pseudotsuga&quot;, and hemlocks &quot;Tsuga&quot; make up the canopy; but other taxa are also important. In the Southern Hemisphere, most coniferous trees (members of Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae) occur mixed with broadleaf species, and are classed as broadleaf-and-mixed forests.

====Temperate broadleaf and mixed====
Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests include a substantial component of trees of the Anthophyta group. They are generally characteristic of the warmer temperate latitudes, but extend to cool temperate ones, particularly in the southern hemisphere. They include such forest types as the mixed deciduous forests of the United States and their counterparts in China and Japan; the broadleaf evergreen rainforests of Japan, Chile, and Tasmania; the sclerophyllous forests of Australia, central Chile, the Mediterranean, and California; and the southern beech Nothofagus forests of Chile and New Zealand.

====Tropical moist====
There are many different types of tropical moist forests, with lowland evergreen broad-leaf tropical rainforests: for example várzea and igapó forests and the terra firme forests of the Amazon Basin; the peat swamp forests; dipterocarp forests of Southeast Asia; and the high forests of the Congo Basin. Seasonal tropical forests, perhaps the best description for the colloquial term &quot;jungle&quot;, typically range from the rainforest zone 10 degrees north or south of the equator, to the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn. Forests located on mountains are also included in this category, divided largely into upper and lower montane formations, on the basis of the variation of physiognomy corresponding to changes in altitude.

====Tropical dry====
Tropical dry forests are characteristic of areas in the tropics affected by seasonal drought. The seasonality of rainfall is usually reflected in the deciduousness of the forest canopy, with most trees being leafless for several months of the year. Under some conditions, such as less fertile soils or less predictable drought regimes, the proportion of evergreen species increases and the forests are characterised as &quot;sclerophyllous&quot;. Thorn forest, a dense forest of low stature with a high frequency of thorny or spiny species, is found where drought is prolonged, and especially where grazing animals are plentiful. On very poor soils, and especially where fire or herbivory are recurrent phenomena, savannas develop.

====Sparse trees and savanna====
Sparse trees and savanna are forests with sparse tree-canopy cover. They occur principally in areas of transition from forested to non-forested landscapes. The two major zones in which these ecosystems occur are in the boreal region and in the seasonally dry tropics. At high latitudes, north of the main zone of boreal forestland, growing conditions are not adequate to maintain a continuously closed forest cover, so tree cover is both sparse and discontinuous. This vegetation is variously called open taiga, open lichen woodland, and forest tundra. A savanna is a mixed woodland–grassland ecosystem characterized by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close. The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer that consists primarily of grasses. Savannas maintain an open canopy despite a high tree density.

====Plantations====
Forest plantations are generally intended for the production of timber and pulpwood. Commonly mono-specific, planted with even spacing between the trees, and intensively managed, these forests are generally important as habitat for native biodiversity. Some are managed in ways that enhance their biodiversity protection functions and can provide ecosystem services such as nutrient capital maintenance, watershed and soil structure protection and carbon storage.

== Area ==

The annual net loss of forest area has decreased since 1990, but the world is not on track to meet the target of the United Nations Strategic Plan for Forests to increase forest area by 3 percent by 2030.

While deforestation is taking place in some areas, new forests are being established through natural expansion or deliberate efforts in other areas. As a result, the net loss of forest area is less than the rate of deforestation; and it, too, is decreasing: from per year in the 1990s to per year during 2010–2020. In absolute terms, the global forest area decreased by between 1990 and 2020, which is an area about the size of Libya.

==Societal significance==


===Ecosystem services===
Forests provide a diversity of ecosystem services including:
* Converting carbon dioxide into oxygen and biomass. A full-grown tree produces about of net oxygen per year.
* Acting as a carbon sink. Therefore, they are necessary to mitigate climate change.
* Aiding in regulating climate. For example, research from 2017 shows that forests induce rainfall. If the forest is cut, it can lead to drought, and in the tropics to occupational heat stress of outdoor workers.
* Purifying water.
* Mitigating natural hazards such as floods.
* Serving as a genetic reserve.
* Serving as a source of lumber and as recreational areas.
* Serving as a source of woodlands and trees for millions of people dependent almost entirely on forests for subsistence for their essential fuelwood, food, and fodder needs.

The main ecosystem services can be summarized in the next table:

Some researchers state that forests do not only provide benefits, but can in certain cases also incur costs to humans. Forests may impose an economic burden, diminish the enjoyment of natural areas, reduce the food-producing capacity of grazing land and cultivated land, reduce biodiversity, reduce available water for humans and wildlife, harbour dangerous or destructive wildlife, and act as reservoirs of human and livestock disease.

An important consideration regarding carbon sequestration is that forests can turn from a carbon sink to a carbon source if plant diversity, density or forest area decreases, as has been observed in different tropical forests The typical tropical forest may become a carbon source by the 2060s. An assessment of European forests found early signs of carbon sink saturation, after decades of increasing strength. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that a combination of measures aimed at increasing forest carbon stocks, andsustainable timber offtake will generate the largest carbon sequestration benefit.

===Forest-dependent people===
The term forest-dependent people is used to describe any of a wide variety of livelihoods that are dependent on access to forests, products harvested from forests, or ecosystem services provided by forests, including those of Indigenous peoples dependent on forests. In India, approximately 22 percent of the population belongs to forest-dependent communities, which live in close proximity to forests and practice agroforestry as a principal part of their livelihood. People of Ghana who rely on timber and bushmeat harvested from forests and Indigenous peoples of the Amazon rainforest are also examples of forest-dependent people. Though forest-dependence by more common definitions is statistically associated with poverty and rural livelihoods, elements of forest-dependence exist in communities with a wide range of characteristics. Generally, richer households derive more cash value from forest resources, whereas among poorer households, forest resources are more important for home consumption and increase community resilience.

===Indigenous peoples===
Forests are fundamental to the culture and livelihood of indigenous people groups that live in and depend on forests, many of which have been removed from and denied access to the lands on which they lived as part of global colonialism. Indigenous lands contain 36% or more of intact forest worldwide, host more biodiversity, and experience less deforestation. Indigenous activists have argued that degradation of forests and indigenous peoples&#x27; marginalization and land dispossession are interconnected. Other concerns among indigenous peoples include lack of Indigenous involvement in forest management and loss of knowledge related for the forest ecosystem. Since 2002, the amount of land that is legally owned by or designated for indigenous peoples has broadly increased, but land acquisition in lower-income countries by multinational corporations, often with little or no consultation of indigenous peoples, has also increased. Research in the Amazon rainforest suggests that indigenous methods of agroforestry form reservoirs of biodiversity. In the U.S. state of Wisconsin, forests managed by indigenous people have more plant diversity, fewer invasive species, higher tree regeneration rates, and higher volume of trees.

==Management==
Forest management has changed considerably over the last few centuries, with rapid changes from the 1980s onward, culminating in a practice now referred to as &quot;sustainable forest management&quot;. Forest ecologists concentrate on forest patterns and processes, usually with the aim of elucidating cause-and-effect relationships. Foresters who practice sustainable forest management focus on the integration of ecological, social, and economic values, often in consultation with local communities and other stakeholders.
Humans have generally decreased the amount of forest worldwide. Anthropogenic factors that can affect forests include logging, urban sprawl, human-caused forest fires, acid rain, invasive species, and the slash and burn practices of swidden agriculture or shifting cultivation. The loss and re-growth of forests lead to a distinction between two broad types of forest: primary or old-growth forest and secondary forest. There are also many natural factors that can cause changes in forests over time, including forest fires, insects, diseases, weather, competition between species, etc. In 1997, the World Resources Institute recorded that only 20% of the world&#x27;s original forests remained in large intact tracts of undisturbed forest. More than 75% of these intact forests lie in three countries: the boreal forests of Russia and Canada, and the rainforest of Brazil.

According to Food and Agriculture Organization&#x27;s (FAO) &quot;Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020&quot;, an estimated of forest have been lost worldwide through deforestation since 1990, but the rate of forest loss has declined substantially. In the most recent five-year period (2015–2020), the annual rate of deforestation was estimated at , down from annually in 2010–2015.

===The forest transition===
The transition of a region from forest loss to net gain in forested land is referred to as the forest transition. This change occurs through a few main pathways, including increase in commercial tree plantations, adoption of agroforestry techniques by small farmers, or spontaneous regeneration when former agricultural land is abandoned. It can be motivated by the economic benefits of forests, the ecosystem services forests provide, or cultural changes where people increasingly appreciate forests for their spiritual, aesthetic, or otherwise intrinsic value. According to the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to avoid temperature rise by more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, there will need to be an increase in global forest cover equal to the land area of Canada () by 2050.

China instituted a ban on logging, beginning in 1998, due to the erosion and flooding that it caused. In addition, ambitious tree-planting programmes in countries such as China, India, the United States, and Vietnam – combined with natural expansion of forests in some regions – have added more than of new forests annually. As a result, the net loss of forest area was reduced to per year between 2000 and 2010, down from annually in the 1990s. In 2015, a study for &quot;Nature Climate Change&quot; showed that the trend has recently been reversed, leading to an &quot;overall gain&quot; in global biomass and forests. This gain is due especially to reforestation in China and Russia. New forests are not equivalent to old growth forests in terms of species diversity, resilience, and carbon capture. On 7 September 2015, the FAO released a new study stating that over the last 25 years the global deforestation rate has decreased by 50% due to improved management of forests and greater government protection.

There is an estimated of forest in protected areas worldwide. Of the six major world regions, South America has the highest share of forests in protected areas, at 31 percent. The area of such areas globally has increased by since 1990, but the rate of annual increase slowed in 2010–2020.

Smaller areas of woodland in cities may be managed as urban forestry, sometimes within public parks. These are often created for human benefits; Attention Restoration Theory argues that spending time in nature reduces stress and improves health, while forest schools and kindergartens help young people to develop social as well as scientific skills in forests. These typically need to be close to where the children live.

===Canada===

Canada has about of forest land. More than 90% of forest land is publicly owned and about 50% of the total forest area is allocated for harvesting. These allocated areas are managed using the principles of sustainable forest management, which include extensive consultation with local stakeholders. About eight percent of Canada&#x27;s forest is legally protected from resource development. Much more forest land—about 40 percent of the total forest land base—is subject to varying degrees of protection through processes such as integrated land use planning or defined management areas, such as certified forests.

By December 2006, over of forest land in Canada (about half the global total) had been certified as being sustainably managed. Clearcutting, first used in the latter half of the 20th century, is less expensive, but devastating to the environment; and companies are required by law to ensure that harvested areas are adequately regenerated. Most Canadian provinces have regulations limiting the size of new clear-cuts, although some older ones grew to over several years.

The Canadian Forest Service is the government department which looks after Forests in Canada.

===Latvia===
Latvia has about of forest land, which equates to about 50.5% of Latvia&#x27;s total area of of forest land (46% of total forest land) is publicly owned and of forest land (54% of the total) is in private hands. Latvia&#x27;s forests have been steadily increasing over the years, which is in contrast to many other nations, mostly due to the forestation of land not used for agriculture. In 1935, there were only of forest; today this has increased by more than 150%. Birch is the most common tree at 28.2%, followed by pine (26.9%), spruce (18.3%), grey alder (9.7%), aspen (8.0%), black alder (5.7%), oak/ash (1.2%), with other hardwood trees making up the rest (2.0%).

===United States===
In the United States, most forests have historically been affected by humans to some degree, though in recent years improved forestry practices have helped regulate or moderate large-scale impacts. The United States Forest Service estimated a net loss of about between 1997 and 2020; this estimate includes conversion of forest land to other uses, including urban and suburban development, as well as afforestation and natural reversion of abandoned crop and pasture land to forest. In many areas of the United States, the area of forest is stable or increasing, particularly in many northern states. The opposite problem from flooding has plagued national forests, with loggers complaining that a lack of thinning and proper forest management has resulted in large forest fires.

<text>The Finger Lakes are a group of eleven long, narrow, roughly north–south lakes located directly south of Lake Ontario in an area called the &quot;Finger Lakes region&quot; in New York, in the United States. This region straddles the northern and transitional edge of the Northern Allegheny Plateau, known as the Finger Lakes Uplands and Gorges ecoregion, and the Ontario Lowlands ecoregion of the Great Lakes Lowlands.

The geological term &quot;finger lake&quot; refers to a long, narrow lake in an overdeepened glacial valley, while the proper name &quot;Finger Lakes&quot; goes back to the late 19th century. Cayuga and Seneca Lakes are among the deepest in the United States, measuring , respectively, with bottoms well below sea level. Though none of the lakes&#x27; widths exceed , Seneca Lake is long, and at is the largest in total area.

== Name ==
The origin of the name &quot;Finger Lakes&quot; is uncertain. Currently, the oldest known published use of &quot;finger lakes&quot; for this group of 11 lakes is in a United States Geological Survey paper by Thomas Chamberlin that was published in 1883. This paper was later cited and &quot;Finger Lakes&quot; formally used as a proper name by R. S. Tarr in a Geological Society of America paper published in 1893. Older usage of &quot;Finger Lakes&quot; in either maps, papers, reports, or any other documents remains to be verified.

== Lakes ==
The eleven Finger Lakes, from west to east, are: 
Cazenovia Lake to the east, although smaller, is sometimes called &quot;the 12th Finger Lake&quot;, because it is similar in shape and limnology. It is in Appalachian hill terrain, lying mostly in the historic village of Cazenovia, and is linked to other Finger Lakes by US 20 and NY 13. It may have been formed in the same manner as the Finger Lakes, as satellite photos show three valleys similar in character and spacing to the Finger Lakes east of Otisco Lake. The first is the Tully Valley, which includes a chain of six small lakes called the Tully Lakes at the south end that could collectively be a &quot;Finger Lake&quot; that never formed because of a terminal moraine. The moraine caused the Tioughnioga River to flow south instead of north, the opposite of the Finger Lakes&#x27; waters. The next two valleys to the east contain Butternut Creek, which flows north, and the East Branch of the Tioughnioga River, which flows south. The next valley contains Limestone Creek, which flows north. Other lakes have also made the claim of being the 12th Finger Lake, including Silver and Onondaga lakes, although Onondaga, as a dimictic lake, has some significant limnological differences.

DeRuyter Reservoir, sometimes called Tioughnioga Lake or DeRuyter Lake, a man-made Finger Lake southwest of Cazenovia Lake on Limestone Creek, is 8 miles from the northernmost point on the Finger Lakes Trail, but was built as a feeder reservoir for the Erie Canal. It is maintained by the New York State Canal Corporation.
Oneida Lake, to the northeast of Syracuse, is sometimes included as the &quot;thumb&quot;, although it is shallow and somewhat different in character from the rest. As with Onondaga and Cazenovia Lakes, it drains into Lake Ontario via the Oswego River and then into the St. Lawrence River ultimately draining into the Atlantic Ocean. Chautauqua Lake, Findley Lake and Kinzua Lake to the west are not considered Finger Lakes; all three drain into the Allegheny River and eventually into the Gulf of Mexico, and in the case of Kinzua and Findley, as with DeRuyter to the east, the lakes are the artificial creation of dams.

Conesus, Hemlock, Canadice, Honeoye, and Otisco are considered the minor Finger Lakes. Other, smaller lakes, including Silver, Waneta, and Lamoka lakes, dot this region. Silver Lake, west of Conesus Lake, would seem to qualify because it is in the Great Lakes watershed, but Waneta and Lamoka lakes, sometimes called the &quot;fingernail&quot; lakes, are part of the Susquehanna River watershed, draining into a tributary of the Chemung River.

East of Oneida and Cazenovia Lakes are the headwaters of the Susquehanna River and Hudson River watersheds (the former in the foothills of the Catskills, the latter through the Mohawk Valley and southern Adirondack Mountains).

== Quaternary geology ==

These glacial finger lakes originated as a series of northward-flowing streams. Around two million years ago, the area was glaciated by first of many continental glaciers of the Laurentide Ice Sheet moved southward from the Hudson Bay area. During the glacial maximums, subglacial meltwater and glacial ice widened, deepened, and accentuated the existing river valleys to form subglacial tunnel valleys. Glacial debris, possibly terminal moraine left behind by the receding ice, acted as dams, allowing lakes to form. Despite the deep erosion of the valleys, the surrounding uplands show little evidence of glaciation, suggesting the ice was thin, or at least unable to cause much erosion at higher elevations. The deep cutting by glacial erosion left some tributaries hanging high above the lakes—both Seneca and Cayuga have tributaries hanging as much as above the valley floors. Based upon sediments cores, seismic stratigraphy, and radiocarbon dates, the finger lakes became ice-free about 14,400 BP calendar. At this time scouring by ice and meltwater ceased and these lakes filled initially with proglacial lake rhythmites. The deposition of proglacial lake rhythmites occurred between 14,400 and 13,900 BP calendar. After the magins of the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated into the Ontario lowlands after 13,900 BP calendar, The accumulation, at first, of massive gray clays followed by dark gray to black, laminated, organic-rich muds, accumulated without interruption until present within the Finger Lakes.

Detailed studies of Marine Isotope Stage 3 and 4 age sediments exposed at a locality called the &quot;Great Gully&quot; on the eastern flank of the Cayuga Lake, near Union Springs, New York, record the presence of a paleolake that existed prior to Cayuga Lake. This paleolake, which is called Glacial Lake Nanette, was a proglacial lake that filled the bedrock valley currently occupied by Cayuga Lake from about 50,000 BP calibrated until it was overridden by a glacial readvance that occurred prior to 30,000 BP calendar and buried it beneath younger glacial till. This research shows that bedrock valleys, in which the Finger lakes lie, existed prior to the Last Glacial Maximum and developed over multiple glaciations.

Finally, although sub-glacial scour during the Last Glacial Maximum removed the majority of pre-existing sediment down to the bedrock bottoms of the Finger Lakes, patches of interglacial deposits are likely preserved locally within or near hanging valleys on the margins of their valleys. For example, the principal site that has been well-studied is the &quot;Fembank&quot; exposure of interglacial deposits on the west margin of Cayuga. This deposit provides direct evidence that some version of Cayuga Lake and its bedrock valley existed prior to Last Glacial Maximum.

==Ecological concerns==
Much of the Finger Lakes area lies upon the Marcellus Shale and the Utica Shale, two prominent natural gas reserves. Due to the recent increase in fracking technology, the natural gas is now accessible for extraction. While some large landowners have leased their lands, and a number of small landowners would like to follow suit, many residents of the Finger Lakes oppose the fracking process due to concerns about groundwater contamination and the industrial impact of the extraction-related activities. The first direct actions and local legislative actions against fracking occurred in the Finger Lakes bioregion. In December 2014, the government of New York banned all fracking in the state, citing pollution risks.

Trash from New York City is also sent to landfills in the area.

Since 2017, all of the Finger Lakes have experienced at least one outbreak of toxic algae, and for most of the lakes it has become an annual occurrence.

== History ==

The Finger Lakes region is a central part of the Iroquois homeland. The Iroquois tribes include the Seneca and Cayuga nations, for which the two largest Finger Lakes are named. The Tuscarora tribe lived in the Finger Lakes region as well, from ca. 1720. The Onondaga and Oneida tribes lived at the eastern edge of the region, closer to their namesake lakes, Oneida Lake and Onondaga Lake. The easternmost Iroquois tribe was the Mohawk.

The Finger Lakes region contains sites of unknown cultural affiliation and age. The Bluff Point Stoneworks is one such site as its age and who may have constructed these enigmatic stone structures has not been determined.

During colonial times, many other tribes moved to the Finger Lakes region, seeking the protection of the Iroquois. For example, in 1753, remnants of several Virginia Siouan tribes, collectively called the Tutelo-Saponi, moved to the town of Coreorgonel at the south end of Cayuga Lake near present-day Ithaca and lived there until 1779, when their village was destroyed by the Sullivan Expedition.

Iroquois towns in the Finger Lakes region included the Seneca town of Gen-nis-he-yo (present-day Geneseo), Kanadaseaga (Seneca Castle, near present-day Geneva), Goiogouen (Cayuga Castle, east of Cayuga Lake), Chonodote (Cayuga town, present-day Aurora), Catherine&#x27;s Town (near present-day Watkins Glen) and Ganondagan State Historic Site in Victor, New York.

As one of the most powerful Indian nations during colonial times, the Iroquois were able to prevent European colonization of the Finger Lakes region for nearly two centuries after first contact, often playing the French off against the British interests in savvy demonstrations of political competence. The renowned ingenuity and adaptability of the Iroquois people were key tools of resistance against hostile European powers rapidly spreading throughout North America, eager to dominate and increasingly brutal toward Native Americans in the Finger Lakes and beyond.

By the late 18th century, with the French governmental influence gone from Canada, Iroquois power had weakened relative to the steady growth in European-Americans&#x27; populations, and internal strife eroded the political unity of the Iroquois Confederacy as it faced pressures from colonists itching to move west and a desire to keep them out of Amerindian lands. During the American Revolutionary War, some Iroquois sided with the British and some with the Americans, resulting in civil war among the Iroquois. In the late 1770s, British-allied Iroquois attacked various American frontier settlements, prompting counter-attacks, culminating in the Sullivan Expedition of 1779, which destroyed most of the Iroquois towns and effectively broke Iroquois power. After the Revolutionary War, the Iroquois and other Indians of the region were assigned reservations. Most of their land, including the Finger Lakes region, was opened up to purchase and settlement.

Roughly the western half of the Finger Lakes region comprised the Phelps and Gorham Purchase of 1790. The region was rapidly settled at the turn of the 19th century, largely by a westward migration from New England, and to a lesser degree by northward influx from Pennsylvania. The regional architecture reflects these area traditions of the Federal and Greek Revival periods.

==Notable places==

The Finger Lakes region, together with the Genesee Country of Western New York, has been referred to as the burned-over district. There, in the 19th century, the Second Great Awakening was a revival of Christianity; some new religions were also formed.

The region was active in reform and utopian movements. Many of its Underground Railroad sites have been documented. For example, the Harriet Tubman Home at Auburn recalls the life and work of the African-American &quot;Moses of her people.&quot;

On the northern end of the Finger Lakes are also Seneca Falls, the birthplace of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement; Waterloo, the birthplace of Memorial Day; and Palmyra, the birthplace of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. An annual outdoor drama, The &quot;Hill Cumorah Pageant&quot;, produced by the church, draws thousands of visitors each year.

Hammondsport was the home of aviation pioneer Glenn Curtiss, and favorable air currents make the area a popular spot for glider pilots. Elmira, just to the south, was the home of Mark Twain in his later life, and the site of an infamous Civil War prison. Corning is most noted as the home of Corning Glass Works and the Corning Museum of Glass. Hornell, just southwest of the Finger Lakes, was a major railroad center; locomotives were repaired there for many years and rail passenger cars are built there today (2022).

Conesus remains the home of the oldest producer of pure grape sacramental wine in the Western hemisphere.
Notable among the historic buildings of the region (most linked below) is the Granger Homestead (1816), a large village house in Federal Style at Canandaigua, New York. Another example of the Federal Style is the Prouty-Chew House (1829) at Geneva, portions of which were altered at various times in new fashions.

Three Greek Revival mansions are situated near three lakes: The Richard DeZeng House, Skaneateles (1839); Rose Hill, Geneva (1839); and Esperanza, Penn Yan (1838). The latter two are open to the public.

The Seward House in Auburn, a National Historic Landmark, is a mansion more characteristic of the Civil War era, virtually unchanged from the nineteenth century. Belhurst Castle, Geneva, a stone mansion in the Romanesque Revival style, now serves as an inn. Sonnenberg mansion at Canandaigua is a later nineteenth-century residence in the Queen Anne style, known for its restored period gardens. Geneva on the Lake is a villa (1910–14) that recalls those on Italian lakes. Now an inn, it has European-style gardens. Many buildings and historic districts of the Finger Lakes region are notable, in addition to these historic houses.

Implemented in August, 2010, the Hemlock-Canadice State Forest covers that encompass the two western Finger Lakes, Hemlock and Canadice. These lakes have provided drinking water for the City of Rochester for more than 100 years. To protect water quality, the city acquired much of the property around the lakes. Over the decades, the land reforested, but a few traces of its past, such as stone walls or cottage foundations, remain. Today these two lakes, with their steep, forested, largely-undeveloped shorelines and deep, clear water, provide visitors a glimpse of the Finger Lakes of the past. The Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) manages this State Forest for compatible public access for recreation, including fishing, hunting, nature study, boating and hiking. Activities in Hemlock-Canadice State Forest are subject the DEC&#x27;s Rules and Regulations for the Use of State Lands, 6 NYCRR Part 190, as well as any other applicable state statutes, rules and regulations. These are sensitive areas because they protect public drinking water.

The Finger Lakes Trail and its branch trails run through the southern portion of the Finger Lakes region and also constitute a portion of the 4,600 mile North Country National Scenic Trail.

Hemlock Lake is home to the state&#x27;s oldest nesting bald eagle site, dating back to the early 1960s. The nesting bald eagles of Hemlock Lake have fostered a resurgence of bald eagles throughout New York State. Hemlock Lake, originally known as &quot;O-Neh-Da&quot; which is Seneca for &quot;Lake of Hemlock Trees&quot;, is home to the nation&#x27;s oldest sacramental winery, founded by Bishop McQuaid in 1872. Today, O-Neh-Da Vineyard continues to make premium natural pure grape wine for churches and foodies alike.

=== Wine ===

The Finger Lakes region is New York&#x27;s largest wine-producing region. Over 400 wineries and vineyards surround Seneca, Cayuga, Canandaigua, Keuka, Conesus, and Hemlock Lakes. Because of the lakes&#x27; great depth, they provide a lake effect to the lush vineyards that flank their shores. Due to the size and concentration of these lakes, the region retains residual summer warmth in the winter and winter&#x27;s cold in the spring; as a result, the grapes are protected from disastrous spring frost during shoot growth, and early frost before the harvest. Additionally, due to the long, narrow, north-to-south positioning of the Finger Lakes, the slopes on the east and west side provide for variations in sunlight exposure, temperature, soil, and more; this leads to a great diversity of growing environments within the region and ultimately in the yielded wine.

The main grape varieties grown are Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewürztraminer, Pinot noir, Cabernet Franc, Vidal blanc, Seyval blanc and many &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot; (American native) varieties or cultivars.

With the passage of the Farm Winery Act in 1976, numerous wineries are now open to visitors. Wineries are a growth industry of the region, contributing through their production and by attracting visitors. The Finger Lakes American Viticulture Area (AVA) includes two of America&#x27;s oldest wineries, O-Neh-Da Vineyard (1872) on Hemlock Lake and The Pleasant Valley Wine Company (1860) on Keuka Lake.

=== Craft beer ===
Aside from wine, the Finger Lakes&#x27; craft beer industry has grown significantly in recent years. In 2018 the region was home to the second-highest number of breweries in New York after the Hudson Valley.

=== Educational institutions ===
The area is also known for higher-education learning. The largest is Ivy League institution Cornell University, in Ithaca. Other notable schools are Ithaca College, also in Ithaca; Syracuse University, SUNY Upstate Medical University, State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, and Le Moyne College, in Syracuse; SUNY Cortland, in Cortland; Tompkins Cortland Community College in Dryden, Ithaca, and Cortland; Wells College in Aurora; Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva; Keuka College in Keuka Park; Finger Lakes Community College in Canandaigua and Geneva; New York Chiropractic College in Seneca Falls and Cayuga Community College in Auburn.

Nearby the Finger Lakes is Binghamton University (SUNY), the University of Rochester, Nazareth College, St. John Fisher University, Roberts Wesleyan College, Monroe Community College, and Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester; Elmira College in Elmira; Corning Community College in Corning; and the State University of New York at Geneseo.

=== Museums ===
The Finger Lakes region is home to several museums. These include the Corning Museum of Glass, the Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University, the Strong National Museum of Play, the Glenn H. Curtiss Museum, the Finger Lakes Boating Museum, the Wings of Eagles Discovery Center, the Sciencenter, the Museum of the Earth, the National Soaring Museum, the Rockwell Museum, the Seward House Museum, the William H. Seward and the Samuel Warren Homesteads of the New York Historical Society, birthplace of New York State&#x27;s first successful commercial winery.

The Women&#x27;s Rights National Historic Park is in Seneca Falls. The park includes the home of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the Wesleyan Chapel, where she held the first convention on women&#x27;s rights in 1848.

<text>A kite is a tethered heavier-than-air or lighter-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag forces. A kite consists of wings, tethers and anchors. Kites often have a bridle and tail to guide the face of the kite so the wind can lift it. Some kite designs do not need a bridle; box kites can have a single attachment point. A kite may have fixed or moving anchors that can balance the kite. The name is derived from the kite, the hovering bird of prey.

There are several shapes of kites. 

The lift that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air moves around the kite&#x27;s surface, producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings. The interaction with the wind also generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind. The resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of one or more of the lines or tethers to which the kite is attached. The anchor point of the kite line may be static or moving (e.g., the towing of a kite by a running person, boat, free-falling anchors as in paragliders and fugitive parakites or vehicle).

The same principles of fluid flow apply in liquids, so kites can be used in underwater currents. Paravanes and otter boards operate underwater on an analogous principle.

Man-lifting kites were made for reconnaissance, entertainment and during development of the first practical aircraft, the biplane.

Kites have a long and varied history and many different types are flown individually and at festivals worldwide. Kites may be flown for recreation, art or other practical uses. Sport kites can be flown in aerial ballet, sometimes as part of a competition. Power kites are multi-line steerable kites designed to generate large forces which can be used to power activities such as kite surfing, kite landboarding, kite buggying and snow kiting.

== History ==
Kites were invented in Asia, though their exact origin can only be speculated. The oldest depiction of a kite is from a mesolithic period cave painting in Muna island, southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia, which has been dated from 9500–9000 years B.C. It depicts a type of kite called &quot;kaghati&quot;, which are still used by modern Muna people. The kite is made from &quot;kolope&quot; (forest tuber) leaf for the mainsail, bamboo skin as the frame, and twisted forest pineapple fiber as rope, though modern kites use string.

In China, the kite has been claimed as the invention of the 5th-century BC Chinese philosophers Mozi (also Mo Di, or Mo Ti) and Lu Ban (also Gongshu Ban, or Kungshu Phan). Materials ideal for kite building were readily available including silk fabric for sail material; fine, high-tensile-strength silk for flying line; and resilient bamboo for a strong, lightweight framework. By 549 AD, paper kites were certainly being flown, as it was recorded that in that year a paper kite was used as a message for a rescue mission. Ancient and medieval Chinese sources describe kites being used for measuring distances, testing the wind, lifting men, signaling, and communication for military operations. The earliest known Chinese kites were flat (not bowed) and often rectangular. Later, tailless kites incorporated a stabilizing bowline. Kites were decorated with mythological motifs and legendary figures; some were fitted with strings and whistles to make musical sounds while flying.
After its introduction into India, the kite further evolved into the fighter kite, known as the patang in India, where thousands are flown every year on festivals such as Makar Sankranti.

Kites were known throughout Polynesia, as far as New Zealand, with the assumption being that the knowledge diffused from China along with the people. Anthropomorphic kites made from cloth and wood were used in religious ceremonies to send prayers to the gods. Polynesian kite traditions are used by anthropologists to get an idea of early &quot;primitive&quot; Asian traditions that are believed to have at one time existed in Asia.

Kites were late to arrive in Europe, although windsock-like banners were known and used by the Romans. Stories of kites were first brought to Europe by Marco Polo towards the end of the 13th century, and kites were brought back by sailors from Japan and Malaysia in the 16th and 17th centuries. Konrad Kyeser described dragon kites in &quot;Bellifortis&quot; about 1400 AD. Although kites were initially regarded as mere curiosities, by the 18th and 19th centuries they were being used as vehicles for scientific research.

In 1752, Benjamin Franklin published an account of a kite experiment to prove that lightning was caused by electricity.

Kites were also instrumental in the research of the Wright brothers, and others, as they developed the first airplane in the late 1800s. Several different designs of man-lifting kites were developed. The period from 1860 to about 1910 became the European &quot;golden age of kiting&quot;.

In the 20th century, many new kite designs are developed. These included Eddy&#x27;s tailless diamond, the tetrahedral kite, the Rogallo wing, the sled kite, the parafoil, and power kites. Kites were used for scientific purposes, especially in meteorology, aeronautics, wireless communications and photography. The Rogallo wing was adapted for stunt kites and hang gliding and the parafoil was adapted for parachuting and paragliding.

The rapid development of mechanically powered aircraft diminished interest in kites. World War II saw a limited use of kites for military purposes (survival radio, Focke Achgelis Fa 330, military radio antenna kites).

Kites are now mostly used for recreation. Lightweight synthetic materials (ripstop nylon, plastic film, carbon fiber tube and rod) are used for kite making. Synthetic rope and cord (nylon, polyethylene, kevlar and dyneema) are used as bridle and kite line.

==Materials==
Designs often emulate flying insects, birds, and other beasts, both real and mythical. The finest Chinese kites are made from split bamboo (usually golden bamboo), covered with silk, and hand painted. On larger kites, clever hinges and latches allow the kite to be disassembled and compactly folded for storage or transport. Cheaper mass-produced kites are often made from printed polyester rather than silk.

Tails are used for some single-line kite designs to keep the kite&#x27;s nose pointing into the wind. Spinners and spinsocks can be attached to the flying line for visual effect. There are rotating wind socks which spin like a turbine. On large display kites these tails, spinners and spinsocks can be long or more.

Modern aerobatic kites use two or four lines to allow fine control of the kite&#x27;s angle to the wind. Traction kites may have an additional line to de-power the kite and quick-release mechanisms to disengage flyer and kite in an emergency.

==Practical uses==
Kites have been used for human flight, military applications, science and meteorology, photography, lifting radio antennas, generating power, aerodynamics experiments, and much more.

===Military applications===
Kites have been used for military purposes in the past, such as signaling, delivery of ammunition, and for observation, both by lifting an observer above the field of battle and by using kite aerial photography.

Kites were first used in warfare by the Chinese. During the Song dynasty the &quot;Fire Crow&quot;, a kite carrying incendiary powder, a fuse, and a burning stick of incense was developed as a weapon.

According to &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, in 647 Kim Yu-sin, a Korean general of Silla rallied his troops to defeat rebels by using flaming kites which also frightened the enemy.

Russian chronicles mention Prince Oleg of Novgorod use of kites during the siege of Constantinople in 906: &quot;and he crafted horses and men of paper, armed and gilded, and lifted them into the air over the city; the Greeks saw them and feared them&quot;.

Walter de Milemete&#x27;s 1326 &quot;De nobilitatibus, sapientiis, et prudentiis regum&quot; treatise depicts a group of knights flying kite laden with a black-powder filled firebomb over the wall of city.

Kites were also used by Admiral Yi of the Joseon Dynasty (13921910) of Korea. During the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598), Admiral Yi commanded his navy using kites. His kites had specific markings directing his fleet to perform various orders.

In the modern era the British Army used kites to haul human lookouts into the air for observation purposes, using the kites developed by Samuel Franklin Cody. Barrage kites were used to protect shipping during the Second World War. Kites were also used for anti-aircraft target practice.
Kites and kytoons were used for lofting communications antenna. Submarines lofted observers in rotary kites.

Palestinians from the Gaza Strip have flown firebomb kites over the Israel–Gaza barrier, setting fires on the Israeli side of the border, hundreds of dunams of Israeli crop fields were burned by firebomb kites launched from Gaza, with an estimated economic loss of several millions of shekels.

===Science and meteorology===
Kites have been used for scientific purposes, such as Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s famous experiment proving that lightning is electricity. Kites were the precursors to the traditional aircraft, and were instrumental in the development of early flying craft. Alexander Graham Bell experimented with very large man-lifting kites, as did the Wright brothers and Lawrence Hargrave. Kites had a historical role in lifting scientific instruments to measure atmospheric conditions for weather forecasting. Francis Ronalds and William Radcliffe Birt described a very stable kite at Kew Observatory as early as 1847 that was trialled for the purpose of supporting self-registering meteorological instruments at height.

===Radio aerials and light beacons===
Kites can be used for radio purposes, by kites carrying antennas for MF, LF or VLF-transmitters. This method was used for the reception station of the first transatlantic transmission by Marconi. Captive balloons may be more convenient for such experiments, because kite-carried antennas require a lot of wind, which may be not always possible with heavy equipment and a ground conductor. It must be taken into account during experiments, that a conductor carried by a kite can lead to high voltage toward ground, which can endanger people and equipment, if suitable precautions (grounding through resistors or a parallel resonant circuit tuned to transmission frequency) are not taken.

Kites can be used to carry light effects such as lightsticks or battery powered lights.

===Kite traction===
Kites can be used to pull people and vehicles downwind. Efficient foil-type kites such as power kites can also be used to sail upwind under the same principles as used by other sailing craft, provided that lateral forces on the ground or in the water are redirected as with the keels, center boards, wheels and ice blades of traditional sailing craft. In the last two decades several kite sailing sports have become popular, such as kite buggying, kite land boarding, kite boating and kite surfing. Snow kiting has also become popular in recent years.

Kite sailing opens several possibilities not available in traditional sailing:

* Wind speeds are greater at higher altitudes
* Kites may be maneuvered dynamically which increases the force available dramatically
* There is no need for mechanical structures to withstand bending forces; vehicles or hulls can be very light or dispensed with all together

===Electricity generation===
Computer-controlled kites can serve as a method of electricity generation when windmills are impractical. Several companies have introduced self-contained crates and shipping containers that provide an alternative to gas-powered generators for remote locations. Such systems use a combination of autonomous, self-launching kites for generation and batteries to store excess power for when winds are low or when otherwise draw exceeds supply. Some designs are tethered to long lines to reach high altitude winds which are always present, even when ground level winds are unavailable or insufficient.

===Underwater kites===
Underwater kites are now being developed to harvest renewable power from the flow of water.
*A kite was used in minesweeping operations from the First World War: this was a foil &quot;attached to a sweep-wire submerging it to the requisite depth when it is towed over a minefield&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;, 2021). See also paravane.

== Cultural uses ==
Kite festivals are a popular form of entertainment throughout the world. They include large local events, traditional festivals which have been held for hundreds of years and major international festivals which bring in kite flyers from other countries to display their unique art kites and demonstrate the latest technical kites.

Many countries have kite museums. These museums may have a focus on historical kites, preserving the country&#x27;s kite traditions.

=== Asia ===

Kite flying is popular in many Asian countries, where it often takes the form of &quot;kite fighting&quot;, in which participants try to snag each other&#x27;s kites or cut other kites down. Fighter kites are usually small, flattened diamond-shaped kites made of paper and bamboo. Tails are not used on fighter kites so that agility and maneuverability are not compromised.In Afghanistan, kite flying is a popular game, and is known in Dari as &quot;Gudiparan Bazi&quot;. Some kite fighters pass their strings through a mixture of ground glass powder and glue, which is legal. The resulting strings are very abrasive and can sever the competitor&#x27;s strings more easily. The abrasive strings can also injure people. During the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, kite flying was banned, among various other recreations.

In Pakistan, kite flying is often known as Gudi-Bazi or Patang-bazi. Although kite flying is a popular ritual for the celebration of spring festival known as Jashn-e-Baharaan (lit. Spring Festival) or Basant, kites are flown throughout the year. Kite fighting is a very popular pastime all around Pakistan, but mostly in urban centers across the country (especially Lahore). The kite fights are at their highest during the spring celebrations and the fighters enjoy competing with rivals to cut-loose the string of the others kite, popularly known as &quot;Paecha&quot;. During the spring festival, kite flying competitions are held across the country and the skies are colored with kites. When a competitor succeeds in cutting another&#x27;s kite loose, shouts of &#x27;wo kata&#x27; ring through the air. Cut kites are reclaimed by chasing after them. This is a popular ritual, especially among the country&#x27;s youth, and is depicted in the 2007 film &quot;The Kite Runner&quot; (although that story is based in neighboring Afghanistan). Kites and strings are a big business in the country and several different types of string are used, including glass-coated, metal, and tandi. Kite flying was banned in Punjab, India due to more than one motorcyclist death caused by glass-coated or metal kite strings. Kup, Patang, Guda, and Nakhlaoo are some of the popular kite brands; they vary in balance, weight and speed.

In Indonesia kites are flown as both sport and recreation. One of the most popular kite variants is from Bali. Balinese kites are unique and they have different designs and forms; birds, butterflies, dragons, ships, etc. In Vietnam, kites are flown without tails. Instead small flutes are attached allowing the wind to &quot;hum&quot; a musical tune. There are other forms of sound-making kites. In Bali, large bows are attached to the front of the kites to make a deep throbbing vibration, and in Malaysia, a row of gourds with sound-slots are used to create a whistle as the kite flies. Malaysia is also home to the Kite Museum in Malacca.

Kite are also popular in Nepal, especially in hilly areas and among the Pahadi and Newar communities, although people also fly kites in Terai areas. Unlike India, people in Nepal fly kites in August – September period and is more popular in time of Dashain.

Kites are very popular in India, with the states of Gujarat, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab notable for their kite fighting festivals. Highly maneuverable single-string paper and bamboo kites are flown from the rooftops while using line friction in an attempt to cut each other&#x27;s kite lines, either by letting the cutting line loose at high speed or by pulling the line in a fast and repeated manner. During the Indian spring festival of Makar Sankranti, near the middle of January, millions of people fly kites all over northern India. Kite flying in Hyderabad starts a month before this, but kite flying/fighting is an important part of other celebrations, including Republic Day, Independence Day, Raksha Bandhan, Viswakarma Puja day in late September and Janmashtami. An international kite festival is held every year before Uttarayan for three days in Vadodara, Surat and Ahmedabad.

Kites have been flown in China since ancient times. Weifang is home to the largest kite museum in the world. It also hosts an annual international kite festival on the large salt flats south of the city. There are several kite museums in Japan, UK, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA. In the pre-modern period, Malays in Singapore used kites for fishing.

In Japan, kite flying is traditionally a children&#x27;s play in New Year holidays and in the Boys&#x27; Festival in May. In some areas, there is a tradition to celebrate a new boy baby with a new kite (祝い凧). There are many kite festivals throughout Japan. The most famous one is &quot;Yōkaichi Giant Kite Festival&quot; in Higashiōmi, Shiga, which started in 1841. The largest kite ever built in the festival is wide by high and weighs . In the Hamamatsu Kite Festival in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, more than 100 kites are flown in the sky over the Nakatajima Sand Dunes, one of the three largest sand dunes in Japan, which overlooks the Enshunada Sea. Parents who have a new baby prepare a new kite with their baby&#x27;s name and fly it in the festival. These kites are traditional ones made from bamboo and paper.

=== Europe ===

In Greece and Cyprus, flying kites is a tradition for Clean Monday, the first day of Lent. In the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda, traditional Bermuda kites are made and flown at Easter, to symbolise Christ&#x27;s ascent. In Fuerteventura a kite festival is usually held on the weekend nearest to 8 November lasting for 3 days.

=== Polynesia ===
Polynesian traditional kites are sometimes used at ceremonies and variants of traditional kites for amusement. Older pieces are kept in museums. These are treasured by the people of Polynesia.

=== South America ===
In Brazil, flying a kite is a very popular leisure activity for children, teenagers and even young adults. Mostly these are boys, and it is overwhelmingly kite fighting a game whose goal is to maneuver their own kites to cut the other persons&#x27; kites&#x27; strings during flight, and followed by kite running where participants race through the streets to take the free-drifting kites. As in other countries with similar traditions, injuries are common and motorcyclists in particular need to take precautions.

In Chile, kites are very popular, especially during Independence Day festivities (September 18).
In Peru, kites are also very popular. There are kite festivals in parks and beaches mostly on August.

In Colombia, kites can be seen flown in parks and recreation areas during August which is calles as windy. It is during this month that most people, especially the young ones would fly kites.

In Guyana, kites are flown at Easter, an activity in which all ethnic and religious groups participate. Kites are generally not flown at any other time of year. Kites start appearing in the sky in the weeks leading up to Easter and school children are taken to parks for the activity. It all culminates in a massive airborne celebration on Easter Monday especially in Georgetown, the capital, and other coastal areas. The history of the practice is not entirely clear but given that Easter is a Christian festival, it is said that kite flying is symbolic of the Risen Lord. Moore describes the phenomenon in the 19th century as follows:

The exact origins of the practice of kite flying (exclusively) at Easter are unclear. Bridget Brereton and Kevin Yelvington speculate that kite flying was introduced by Chinese indentured immigrants to the then colony of British Guiana in the mid 19th century. The author of an article in the &quot;Guyana Chronicle&quot; newspaper of May 6, 2007 is more certain:

== World records ==

There are many world records involving kites. The world&#x27;s largest kites are inflatable single-line kites. The world record for the largest kite flown for at least 20 minutes is &quot;The Flag of Kuwait&quot;. 

The world record for most kites flown simultaneously was achieved in 2011 when 12,350 kites were flown by children on Al-Waha beach in Gaza Strip. 

The single-kite altitude record is held by a triangular-box delta kite. On 23 September 2014 a team led by Robert Moore, flew a kite to above ground level. The record altitude was reached after eight series of attempts over a ten-year period from a remote location in western New South Wales, Australia. The tall and wide Dunton-Taylor delta kite&#x27;s flight was controlled by a winch system using of ultra high strength Dyneema line. The flight took about eight hours from ground and return. The height was measured with on-board GPS telemetry transmitting positional data in real time to a ground-based computer and also back-up GPS data loggers for later analysis.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;The Kite Runner&quot;, a 2005 novel by Khaled Hosseini dramatizes the role of kite fighting in pre-war Kabul.
* The &quot;Peanuts&quot; cartoon character Charlie Brown was often depicted having flown his kite into a tree as a metaphor for life&#x27;s adversities.
* &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Fly a Kite&quot; is a song from the Mary Poppins film and musical.
* In the Disney animated film &quot;Mulan&quot;, kites are flown in the parade.
* In the film &quot;Shooter&quot;, a kite is used to show the wind direction and wind velocity.
* &quot;Kite&quot; is a 1978 song celebrating kite flying and appears on Kate Bush&#x27;s first album, &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;.

==General safety issues==
There are safety issues involved in kite-flying. Kite lines can strike and tangle on electrical power lines, causing power blackouts and running the risk of electrocuting the kite flier. Wet kite lines or wire can act as a conductor for static electricity and lightning when the weather is stormy. Kites with large surface area or powerful lift can lift kite fliers off the ground or drag them into other objects. In urban areas there is usually a ceiling on how high a kite can be flown, to prevent the kite and line infringing on the airspace of helicopters and light aircraft. It is also possible for fighter kites to kill people, as happened in India when three spectators were killed in separate incidents during Independence Day, August, 2016—precipitating a ban on certain types of enhanced line.

The government of Egypt banned kite-flying in July 2020, seizing 369 kites in Cairo and 99 in Alexandria, citing both safety and national security concerns.

<text>A fanzine (blend of &quot;fan&quot; and &quot;magazine&quot; or &quot;-zine&quot;) is a non-professional and non-official publication produced by enthusiasts of a particular cultural phenomenon (such as a literary or musical genre) for the pleasure of others who share their interest. The term was coined in an October 1940 science fiction fanzine by Russ Chauvenet and first popularized within science fiction fandom, and from there the term was adopted by other communities.

Typically, publishers, editors, writers and other contributors of articles or illustrations to fanzines are not paid. Fanzines are traditionally circulated free of charge, or for a nominal cost to defray postage or production expenses. Copies are often offered in exchange for similar publications, or for contributions of art, articles, or letters of comment (LoCs), which are then published.

Some fanzines are typed and photocopied by amateurs using standard home office equipment. A few fanzines have developed into professional publications (sometimes known as &quot;prozines&quot;), and many professional writers were first published in fanzines; some continue to contribute to them after establishing a professional reputation. The term fanzine is sometimes confused with &quot;fan magazine&quot;, but the latter term most often refers to commercially produced publications &quot;for&quot; (rather than &quot;by&quot;) fans.

==Origin==
The origins of amateur fanac &quot;fan&quot; publications are obscure, but can be traced at least back to 19th century literary groups in the United States which formed amateur press associations to publish collections of amateur fiction, poetry, and commentary, such as H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;United Amateur&quot;.

As professional printing technology progressed, so did the technology of fanzines. Early fanzines were hand-drafted or typed on a manual typewriter and printed using primitive reproduction techniques (e.g., the spirit duplicator or even the hectograph). Only a very small number of copies could be made at a time, so circulation was extremely limited. The use of mimeograph machines enabled greater press runs, and the photocopier increased the speed and ease of publishing once more. Today, thanks to the advent of desktop publishing and self-publication, there is often little difference between the appearance of a fanzine and a professional magazine.

==Genres==

===Science fiction===

When Hugo Gernsback published the first science fiction magazine, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in 1926, he allowed for a large letter column which printed reader&#x27;s addresses. By 1927 readers, often young adults, would write to each other, bypassing the magazine. Science fiction fanzines had their beginnings in Serious &amp; Constructive (later shortened to sercon) correspondence. The fans would start up clubs to ease finding others with their same interests. Gernsback founded the Science Fiction League in 1934, where these clubs could advertise for more users.

The first science fiction fanzine, &quot;The Comet&quot;, was published in 1930 by the Science Correspondence Club in Chicago and edited by Raymond A. Palmer and Walter Dennis. The term &quot;fanzine&quot; was coined by Russ Chauvenet in the October 1940 edition of his fanzine &quot;Detours&quot;. &quot;Fanzines&quot; were distinguished from &quot;prozines&quot; (a term Chauvenet also invented), that is, all professional magazines. Prior to that, the fan publications were known as &quot;fanmags&quot;.

Science fiction fanzines used a variety of printing methods. Typewriters, school dittos, church mimeos and (if they could afford it) multi-color letterpress or other mid-to-high level printing. Some fans wanted their news spread, others reveled in the artistry and beauty of fine printing. The hectograph, introduced around 1876, was so named because it could produce (in theory) up to a hundred copies. Hecto used an aniline dye, transferred to a tray of gelatin, and paper would be placed on the gel, one sheet at a time, for transfer. Messy and smelly, the process could create vibrant colors for the few copies produced, the easiest aniline dye to make being purple (technically indigo). The next small but significant technological step after hectography is the spirit duplicator, essentially the hectography process using a drum instead of the gelatin. Introduced by Ditto Corporation in 1923, these machines were known for the next six decades as Ditto Machines and used by fans because they were cheap to use and could (with a little effort) print in color.

The mimeograph machine, which forced ink through a wax paper stencil cut by the keys of a typewriter, was the standard for many decades. A second-hand mimeo could print hundreds of copies and (with more than a little effort) print in color. The electronic stencil cutter (shortened to &quot;electrostencil&quot; by most) could add photographs and illustrations to a mimeo stencil. A mimeo&#x27;d zine could look terrible or look beautiful, depending more on the skill of the mimeo operator than the quality of the equipment. Only a few fans could afford more professional printers, or the time it took them to print, until photocopying became cheap and ubiquitous in the 1970s. With the advent of computer printers and desktop publishing in the 1980s, fanzines began to look far more professional. The rise of the internet made correspondence cheaper and &quot;much&quot; faster, and the World Wide Web has made publishing a fanzine as simple as coding a web page.

New technology brought various print style innovations. For example, there were alphanumeric contractions which are actually precursors to &quot;leetspeak&#x27; (a well-known example is the &quot;initials&quot; used by Forrest J. Ackerman in his fanzines from the 1930s and 1940s, namely &quot;4sj&quot;. Fans around the world knew Ackerman by three letters &quot;4sj&quot; or even two: &quot;4e&quot; for &quot;Forry&quot;). Fanspeak is rich with abbreviations and concatenations. Where teenagers labored to save typing on ditto masters, they now save keystrokes when text messaging. Ackerman invented nonstoparagraphing as a space-saving measure. When the typist comes to the end of a paragraph, they simply moved the platen down one line.

Never commercial enterprises, most science fiction fanzines were (and many still are) available for &quot;the usual&quot;, a sample issue will be mailed on request. To receive further issues, a reader sends a &quot;letter of comment&quot; (LoC) about the fanzine to the editor. The LoC might be published in the next issue; some fanzines consisted almost exclusively of letter columns, where discussions were conducted in much the same way as they are in internet newsgroups and mailing lists today, though at a relatively glacial pace. Often fanzine editors (&quot;faneds&quot;) would simply swap issues with each other, not worrying too much about matching trade for trade, somewhat like being on one another&#x27;s friends list. Without being closely connected with the rest of fandom, a budding faned could read fanzine reviews in prozines, and fanzines reviewed other fanzines. Recent technology has changed the speed of communication between fans and the technology available, but the basic concepts developed by science fiction fanzines in the 1930s can be seen online today. Blogs—with their threaded comments, personalized illustrations, shorthand in-jokes, wide variety in quality and wider variety of content—follow the structure developed in science fiction fanzines, without (usually) realizing the antecedent.

Since 1937, science fiction fans have formed amateur press associations (APAs); the members contribute to a collective assemblage or bundle that contains contributions from all of them, called apazines and often containing mailing comments. Some APAs are still active, and some are published as virtual &quot;e-zines&quot;, distributed on the Internet. Specific Hugo Awards are given for fanzines, fan writing and fanart.

==== Media ====
Media fanzines were originally merely a subgenre of SF fanzines, written by science fiction fans already familiar with apazines. The first media fanzine was a &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan publication called &quot;Spockanalia&quot;, published in September 1967 by members of the Lunarians. They hoped that fanzines such as &quot;Spockanalia&quot; would be recognized by the broader science-fiction fan community in traditional ways, such as a Hugo Award for Best Fanzine. All five of its issues were published while the show was still on the air, and included letters from D. C. Fontana, Gene Roddenberry, and most of the cast members, and an article by future Hugo and Nebula winner Lois McMaster Bujold.

Many other Star Trek &#x27;zines followed, then slowly zines appeared for other media sources, such as &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;, &quot;Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; and &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;. By the mid-1970s, there were enough media zines being published that adzines existed just to advertise all of the other zines available. Although &quot;Spockanalia&quot; had a mix of stories and essays, most zines were all fiction. Like SF fanzines, these media zines spanned the gamut of publishing quality from digest-sized mimeos to offset printed masterpieces with four-color covers.

Men wrote and edited most previous science fiction fanzines, which typically published articles reporting on trips to conventions, and reviews of books and other fanzines. Camille Bacon-Smith later stated that &quot;One thing you almost never find in a science fiction fanzine is science fiction. Rather ... fanzines were the social glue that created a community out of a worldwide scattering of readers.&quot; Women published most media fanzines, which by contrast also included fan fiction. By doing so, they &quot;fill the need of a mostly female audience for fictional narratives that expand the boundary of the official source products offered on the television and movie screen.&quot; In addition to long and short stories, as well as poetry, many media fanzines included illustrated stories, as well as stand alone art, often featuring portraits of the show or film&#x27;s principal characters. The art could range from simple sketches, to reproductions of large elaborate works painted in oil or acrylic, though most are created in ink.

In the late 1970s, fiction that included a sexual relationship between two of the male characters of the media source (first Kirk/Spock, then later Starsky/Hutch, Napoleon/Illya, and many others) started to appear in zines. These became known as slash fiction from the &#x27;/&#x27; mark used in adzines. The slash help to differentiate a K&amp;S story (which would have been a Kirk and Spock friendship story) from a K/S story, which would have been one with a romantic or sexual bent between the characters. Slash zines eventually had their own subgenres, such as Femslash. By 2000, when web publishing of stories became more popular than zine publishing, thousands of media fanzines had been published; over 500 of them were k/s zines.

Another popular franchise for fanzines was the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga. By the time the film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was released in 1980, Star Wars fanzines had surpassed Star Trek zines in sales. An unfortunate episode in fanzine history occurred in 1981 when Star Wars director George Lucas threatened to sue fanzine publishers who distributed zines featuring the Star Wars characters in sexually explicit stories or art.

Comics were mentioned and discussed as early as the late 1930s in the fanzines of science fiction fandom. Famously, the first version of Superman (a bald-headed villain) appeared in the third issue of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster&#x27;s 1933 fanzine &quot;Science Fiction&quot;. In 1936, David Kyle published &quot; The Fantasy World &quot;, possibly the first comics fanzine. Malcolm Willits and Jim Bradley started &quot;The Comic Collector&#x27;s News&quot; in October 1947. By 1952, Ted White had mimeographed a four-page pamphlet about Superman, and James Vincent Taurasi, Sr. issued the short-lived &quot;Fantasy Comics&quot;. In 1953, Bhob Stewart published &quot;The EC Fan Bulletin&quot;, which launched EC fandom of imitative EC fanzines. A few months later, Stewart, White, and Larry Stark produced &quot;Potrzebie&quot;, planned as a literary journal of critical commentary about EC by Stark. Among the wave of EC fanzines that followed, the best-known was Ron Parker&#x27;s &quot;Hoo-Hah!&quot;. After that came fanzines by the followers of Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s &quot;Mad&quot;, &quot;Trump&quot; and &quot;Humbug&quot;. Publishers of these included future underground comics stars like Jay Lynch and Robert Crumb.

In 1960, Richard and Pat Lupoff launched their science fiction and comics fanzine &quot;Xero&quot;. In the second issue, &quot;The Spawn of M.C. Gaines&#x27;&quot; by Ted White was the first in a series of nostalgic, analytical articles about comics by Lupoff, Don Thompson, Bill Blackbeard, Jim Harmon and others under the heading, &quot;All in Color for a Dime&quot;. In 1961, Jerry Bails&#x27; &quot;Alter Ego&quot;, devoted to costumed heroes, became a focal point for superhero comics fandom and is thus sometimes mistakenly cited as the first comics fanzine.

Contacts through these magazines were instrumental in creating the culture of modern comics fandom: conventions, collecting, etc. Much of this, like comics fandom itself, began as part of standard science fiction conventions, but comics fans have developed their own traditions. Comics fanzines often include fan artwork based on existing characters as well as discussion of the history of comics. Through the 1960s, and 1970s, comic fanzines followed some general formats, such as the industry news and information magazine (&quot;The Comic Reader&quot; was one example), interview, history, and review-based fanzines, and the fanzines which basically represented independent comic book-format exercises. While perceived quality varied widely, the energy and enthusiasm involved tended to be communicated clearly to the readership, many of whom were also fanzine contributors. Prominent comics zines of this period included &quot;Alter Ego&quot;, &quot;The Comic Reader&quot;, and &quot;Rocket&#x27;s Blast Comicollector&quot;, all started by Jerry Bails. During the 1970s, many fanzines (&quot;Squa Tront&quot;, as an example) also became partly distributed through certain comic book distributors.

One of the first British comics fanzines was Phil Clarke&#x27;s &quot;KA-POW&quot;, launched in 1967. Prominent British comics fanzines of the 1970s and early 1980s included the long-running &quot;Fantasy Advertiser&quot;, Martin Lock&#x27;s &quot;BEM&quot;, Richard Burton&#x27;s &quot;Comic Media News&quot;, Alan Austin&#x27;s &quot;Comics Unlimited&quot;, George Barnett&#x27;s &quot;The Panelologist&quot;, and Richard Ashford&#x27;s &quot;Speakaeasy&quot;.

At times, the professional comics publishers have made overtures to fandom via &#x27;prozines&#x27;, in this case fanzine-like magazines put out by the major publishers. &quot;The Amazing World of DC Comics&quot; and the Marvel magazine &quot;FOOM&quot; began and ceased publication in the 1970s. Priced significantly higher than standard comics of the period (&quot;AWODCC&quot; was $1.50, &quot;FOOM&quot; was 75 cents), each house-organ magazine lasted a brief period of years. Since 2001 in Britain, there have been created a number of fanzines pastiching children&#x27;s comics of the 1970s, and 1980s (e.g. &quot;Solar Wind&quot;, &quot;Pony School&quot;, etc.). These adopt a style of storytelling rather than specific characters from their sources, usually with a knowing or ironic twist.

===Horror film ===

As with comics zines, horror film fanzines grew from related interest within science fiction fan publications. &quot;Trumpet,&quot; edited by Tom Reamy, was a 1960s SF zine that branched into horror film coverage. Alex Soma&#x27;s &quot;Horrors of the Screen,&quot; Calvin T. Beck&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Frankenstein&quot; (later &quot;Castle of Frankenstein&quot;) and Gary Svehla&#x27;s &quot;Gore Creatures&quot; were the first horror fanzines created as more serious alternatives to the popular Forrest J Ackerman 1958 magazine &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland.&quot; &quot;Gore Creatures&quot; began in 1961 and continues today as the prozine (and specialty publisher) &quot;Midnight Marquee.&quot; &quot;Garden Ghouls Gazette&quot;—a 1960s horror title under the editorship of Dave Keil, then Gary Collins—was eventually headed by the late Frederick S. Clarke (1949–2000) and in 1967 became the respected journal &quot;Cinefantastique.&quot; It later became a prozine under journalist-screenwriter Mark A. Altman and has continued as a webzine.

Mark Frank&#x27;s &quot;Photon&quot;—notable for the inclusion of an 8x10 photo in each issue—was another 1960s zine that lasted into the 1970s. Richard Klemensen&#x27;s &quot;Little Shoppe of Horrors&quot;, having a particular focus on &quot;Hammer Horrors&quot;, began in 1972 and is still publishing as of 2024. &quot;The Animation Journal&quot; (1964-1966) edited by Indiana natives Steve Towsley and Bill Shrock was perhaps the first fanzine devoted to the makers of stop-motion animated monsters.

The Baltimore-based &quot;Black Oracle&quot; (1969–1978) from writer-turned-John Waters repertory member George Stover was a diminutive zine that evolved into the larger-format &quot;Cinemacabre.&quot; Stover&#x27;s &quot;Black Oracle&quot; partner Bill George published his own short-lived zine &quot;The Late Show&quot; (1974–1976; with co-editor Martin Falck), and later became editor of the &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; prozine spinoff &quot;Femme Fatales&quot;. In the mid-1970s, North Carolina teenager Sam Irvin published the horror/science-fiction fanzine &quot;Bizarre&quot;, which included his original interviews with UK actors and filmmakers; Irvin would later become a producer-director in his own right. 
&quot;Japanese Fantasy Film Journal&quot; (JFFJ) (1968–1983) from Greg Shoemaker covered Toho&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; and his Asian brethren. &quot;Japanese Giants&quot; (JG) was founded by Stephen Mark Rainey in 1974 and was published for 30 years. In 1993, &quot;G-FAN&quot; was published, and reached its 100th regularly published issue in Fall 2012. &quot;FXRH&quot; (Special effects by Ray Harryhausen) (1971–1976) was a specialized zine co-created by future Hollywood FX artist Ernest D. Farino.

===Rock and roll ===
By the mid-1960s, several fans active in science fiction and comics fandom recognized a shared interest in rock music, and the rock fanzine was born. Paul Williams and Greg Shaw were two such SF-fans turned rock zine editors. Williams&#x27; &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; (1966) and Shaw&#x27;s two California-based zines, &quot;Mojo Navigator&quot; (full title, &quot;Mojo-Navigator Rock and Roll News&quot;) (1966) and &quot;Who Put the Bomp&quot;, (1970), are among the most important early rock fanzines.

&quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; (1966) quickly moved from its fanzine roots to become one of the first rock music &quot;prozines&quot;, with paid advertisers and newsstand distribution. &quot;Bomp&quot; remained a fanzine, featuring many writers who would later become prominent music journalists, including Lester Bangs, Greil Marcus, Ken Barnes, Ed Ward, Dave Marsh, Metal Mike Saunders and R. Meltzer. &quot;Bomp&quot; featured cover art by Jay Kinney and Bill Rotsler, both veterans of SF and Comics fandom. &quot;Bomp&quot; was not alone; an August 1970 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included an article about the explosion of rock fanzines. Other rock fanzines of this period include &quot;denim delinquent&quot; 1971, edited by Jymn Parrett, &quot;Flash,&quot; 1972, edited by Mark Shipper, &quot;Eurock Magazine&quot; (1973–1993) edited by Archie Patterson and &quot;Bam Balam,&quot; written and published by Brian Hogg in East Lothian, Scotland, beginning in 1974, and in the mid-1970s, &quot;Back Door Man&quot;.

In the post-punk era, several well-written fanzines emerged that cast an almost academic look at earlier, neglected musical forms, including Mike Stax&#x27; &quot;Ugly Things&quot;, Billy Miller and Miriam Linna&#x27;s &quot;Kicks&quot;, Jake Austen&#x27;s &quot;Roctober&quot;, Kim Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Scram&quot;, P. Edwin Letcher&#x27;s &quot;Garage &amp; Beat&quot;, and the UK&#x27;s &quot;Shindig!&quot; and Italy&#x27;s &quot;Misty Lane&quot;.

In the 1980s, with the rise of stadium superstars, many home-grown rock fanzines emerged. At the peak of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s megastardom following the &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; album and Born in the U.S.A. Tour in the mid-1980s, there were no less than five Springsteen fanzines circulating at the same time in the UK alone, and many others elsewhere. Gary Desmond&#x27;s &quot;Candy&#x27;s Room&quot;, coming from Liverpool, was the first in 1980, quickly followed by Dan French&#x27;s &quot;Point Blank&quot;, Dave Percival&#x27;s &quot;The Fever&quot;, Jeff Matthews&#x27; &quot;Rendezvous&quot;, and Paul Limbrick&#x27;s &quot;Jackson Cage&quot;. In the US, &quot;Backstreets Magazine&quot; started in Seattle in 1980 and still continues today as a glossy publication, now in communication with Springsteen&#x27;s management and official website. In the late 1990s, numerous fanzines and e-zines flourished about electronic and post-rock music. &quot;Crème Brûlée&quot; fanzine was one of those that documented post-rock genre and experimental music.

===Punk ===


====United Kingdom ====

The punk subculture in the United Kingdom spearheaded a surge of interest in fanzines as a countercultural alternative to established print media. In his 1985 book &quot;One Chord Wonders&quot;, Dave Laing argues that fanzines, along with self-produced 7&quot; single records, were the essence of &#x27;punk difference&#x27;. Matt Worley, in &quot;Xerox Machine&quot;, sees the significance of fanzines in punk as both at the time a response to &#x27;an out-of-touch [mainstream] music press&#x27; and retrospectively as a way of &#x27;trac[ing] punk&#x27;s cultural influence into the backrooms, bedrooms and side streets of Britain&#x27;. The first and still best known UK &#x27;punk zine&#x27; was &quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot;, produced by Deptford punk fan Mark Perry. &quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot; ran for 12 photocopied issues; the first issue was produced by Perry immediately following (and in response to) the London debut of The Ramones on 4 July 1976. Other UK fanzines included &quot;Blam!&quot;, &quot;Bombsite&quot;, &quot;Wool City Rocker&quot;, &quot;Burnt Offering&quot;, &quot;Sideburns&quot;, &quot;Chainsaw&quot;, &quot;New Crimes&quot;, &quot;Vague&quot;, &quot;Jamming&quot;, Artcore Fanzine, &quot;Love and Molotov Cocktails&quot;, &quot;To Hell With Poverty&quot;, &quot;New Youth&quot;, &quot;Peroxide&quot;, &quot;ENZK&quot;, &quot;Juniper beri-beri&quot;, &quot;No Cure&quot;, &quot;Communication Blur&quot;, &quot;Rox&quot;, &quot;Grim Humour&quot;, &quot;Spuno&quot;, &quot;Cool Notes&quot; and &quot;Fumes&quot;. Of these, Tony Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Jamming&quot; was the most far reaching, becoming a nationally distributed mainstream magazine for several years before its demise.

====United States ====

In the United States, &quot;Punk&quot; began publication in 1976 out of New York City and played a major part in popularizing punk rock (a term coined a few years earlier in &quot;Creem&quot;) as the term for the music and the bands being written about.

&quot;Flipside&quot; and &quot;Slash&quot; were important punk fanzines from the Los Angeles scene, both debuting in 1977. The San Francisco-based punk fanzine &quot;Search and Destroy&quot;, which published from 1977 to 1979, eventually became the influential fringe-cultural magazine &quot;Re/Search&quot;. &quot;Damage&quot; published 13 issues there from 1979 to 1981. &quot;Maximum RocknRoll&quot;, also from San Francisco, was a major punk fanzine, with over 300 issues published since 1982.

The Washington, D.C. punk community generated several fanzines in the late 1970s and early 1980s, such as &quot;Capitol Crisis&quot;, &quot;Vintage Violence&quot;, &quot;Thrillseeker&quot;, &quot;If This Goes On&quot;, and &quot;Descenes&quot;.

As punk and alternative culture grew more popular throughout the 1980s and 1990s—evidenced by the success of punk and alternative rock bands like Sonic Youth, Nirvana, Fugazi, Bikini Kill, Green Day and The Offspring—thousands of other punk fanzines appeared in the United States, such as &quot;Punk Planet&quot;, &quot;Left of the Dial&quot;, &quot;Tail Spins&quot;, &quot;Sobriquet&quot;, &quot;Profane Existence&quot; and &quot;Slug and Lettuce&quot;.

Some punk fanzines from the 1980s, like &quot;No Class&quot; and &quot;Ugly American&quot; experienced a second life by placing all past content online for free and adding new content. Although fewer in number in the 21st century, punk fanzines still exist in the United States, such as &quot;Suburban Rebels&quot; and &quot;Razorcake&quot;, both from California.

Most punk fanzines were printed in small quantities and promoted their respective local scenes. They were often cheaply photocopied and many never survived beyond a few issues. Their greatest contribution was in promoting punk music, clothing, and lifestyle in their local communities. Punk bands and independent labels often sent records to the zines for review and many of the people who started the zines became critical connections for punk bands on tour.

Australia

In 1977, Bruce Milne and Clinton Walker fused their respective punk zines &quot;Plastered Press&quot; and &quot;Suicide Alley&quot; to launch &quot;Pulp&quot;; Milne later went on to invent the cassette zine with &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, in 1980.

====After the year 2000====

In the UK, &quot;Fracture&quot; and &quot;Reason To Believe&quot; were significant fanzines in the early 2000s, but both ended in late 2003. &quot;Rancid News&quot; filled the gap left by these two zines for a short while. On its tenth issue &quot;Rancid News&quot; changed its name to &quot;Last Hours&quot; with 7 issues published under this title before going on hiatus. &quot;Last Hours&quot; still operates as a webzine though with more focus on the anti-authoritarian movement than its original title. &quot;Artcore Fanzine&quot; (established in 1986) continues to this day, recently publishing a number of 30-year anniversary issues. There are many smaller fanzines in existence throughout the UK that focus on punk.

=====Mark Wilkins and Mystic Records=====

Mark Wilkins, the promotion director for 1982 onwards US punk/thrash label Mystic Records, had over 450 US fanzines and 150 foreign fanzines he promoted to regularly. He and Mystic Records owner Doug Moody edited &quot;The Mystic News Newsletter&quot; which was published quarterly and went into every promo package to fanzines. Wilkins also published the highly successful Los Angeles punk humor zine &quot;Wild Times&quot; and when he ran out of funding for the zine syndicated some of the humorous material to over 100 US fanzines under the name of Mystic Mark.

====Italy====
In Perugia, Italy, &quot;Mazquerade&quot; ran from 1979 to 1981.

In Basilicata, Italy, &quot;Raw Art Fanzine&quot; ran from 1995 to 2000.

In Milan, Italy, &quot;Gorezilla&quot; ran from 1988 to 1991.

===Mod===
In the United Kingdom, the 1979 Mod revival, which was inspired by the 1960s Mod subculture, brought with it a burst of fresh creativity from fanzines, and for the next decade, the youth subculture inspired the production of dozens of independent publications. The most successful of the first wave was &quot;Maximum Speed&quot;, which successfully captured the frenetic world of a mod revival scene that was propelling bands like Secret Affair, Purple Hearts and The Chords into the UK charts.

After the genre had started to go out of fashion with mainstream audiences in 1981, the mod revival scene went underground and successfully reinvented itself through a series of clubs, bands and fanzines that breathed fresh life into the genre, culminating in another burst of creative acceptance in 1985. This success was largely driven by the network of underground fanzines, the most important and far reaching of which were &quot;Extraordinary Sensations&quot;, produced by future radio DJ Eddie Piller, and &quot;Shadows &amp; Reflections&quot;, published by future national magazine editor Chris Hunt. The latter in particular pushed back the boundaries of fanzine production, producing glossy, professionally written and printed publications at a time (1983–1986) when most fanzines were produced via photocopier and letraset.

===Local music===
In the UK, there were also fanzines that covered the local music scene in a particular town or city. Mainly prevalent in the 1970s, and 1980s, all music styles were covered, whether the bands were playing rock, punk, metal, futurist, ska or dance. Featured were local gig reviews and articles that were below the radar of the mainstream music press. They were produced using the technology of the time, i.e. typewriter and Letraset. Examples include &quot;Bombsite Fanzine&quot; (Liverpool 1977), Wool City Rocker (Bradford 1979–1982), &quot;City Fun&quot; (Manchester), 1984, Spuno (Bath 1980) &quot;No Cure&quot; (Berkshire) and &quot;Town Hall Steps&quot; (Bolton) and more recently &quot;mono&quot; (fanzine), (Bradford) with many more across the country, such as Premonition Tapes Tapezine on cassette (Sheffield 1987) and Crime Pays (Liverpool 1988).

===Role-playing-game fanzines===
Another sizable group of fanzines arose in role-playing game (RPG) fandom, where fanzines allowed people to publish their ideas and views on specific games and their role-playing campaigns. In 1975, was released the apazine &quot;Alarums and Excursions&quot;.

Role-playing fanzines allowed people to communicate in the 1970s, and 1980s with complete editorial control in the hands of the players, as opposed to the game publishers. These early RPG fanzines were generally typed, sold mostly in an A5 format (in the UK) and were usually illustrated with abysmal or indifferent artwork.

A fanzine community developed and was based on sale to a reading public and exchanges by editor/publishers. Many of the pioneers of RPG got their start in, or remain part of, science fiction fandom. This is also true of the small but still active board game fandom scene, the most prolific subset of which is centered around play-by-mail &quot;Diplomacy&quot;.

The UK fanzine &quot;Aslan&quot; (1988–1991) was responsible for popularization of freeform role-playing games in the UK.

===Video gaming ===

Video game fanzines first emerged during the second generation period at a time when gaming stores and newsletters for computer user groups were beginning to become established but had not yet receive significant recognition by purchasers and gamers. The earliest such publication was &quot;Joystick Jolter&quot;. Other subscriber-based newsletters included &quot;8:16&quot; (UK, all things Atari, 1st issue Nov 1987), &quot;The Video Game Update&quot;, later titled &quot;Computer Entertainer&quot;.

As desktop publishing tools became more accessible, there was an increase in fanzine production. Fanzines generally emphasized either classic gaming (e.g. &quot;2600 Connection&quot; and &quot;Classic Systems &amp; Games Monthly&quot;), or current gaming (e.g. &quot;APE&quot; and &quot;The Subversive Sprite&quot;). Less commonly, some fanzines covered both topics (e.g. &quot;Digital Press&quot; and &quot;Joystick &amp; Screen&quot;). The number of zines grew with the development of video game journalism as writers like Arnie Katz and Chris Bieniek used their columns in mainstream magazines like &quot;Video Games &amp; Computer Entertainment&quot;, &quot;EGM&quot;, and &quot;Tips &amp; Tricks&quot;, to publish reviews of promising fanzines. These mainstream reviews had the effect of introducing fan editors to each other and of creating a fanzine scene.

The popularity of video game fanzines diminished greatly with the rise of the internet, however some zines—particularly the classic gaming ones (e.g. &quot;Classic Gamer Magazine&quot; and &quot;Video Game Collector&quot;)—continued beyond the mid-90s. The rise of &quot;on demand&quot; publishing has led to a new outlet for print zines, like &quot;Jumpbutton&quot; and &quot;Scroll&quot;.

The video game fanzine era was biggest in the US and Canada, but zines are also produced in other countries. Prominent video game fanzines produced in the UK include &quot;Retrogamer&quot;, &quot;Pixel Nation&quot;, &quot;Capcom Fanzine&quot;, &quot;Mercury&quot;, and &quot;Super Famicom Mini Mag&quot; among others. In France fanzines like &quot;Revival&quot; were circulated, and Japan has seen the production of lavish doujin works.

More recently, there has been a mini-resurgence in video game fanzines, with the launch of &quot;HyperPlay RPG&quot; in 2015 and &quot;Switch Player&quot; in 2017. Based in part on &quot;Super Play&quot;″s focus on role-playing games and &quot;any-bit&quot; Nintendo, &quot;HyperPlay RPG&quot; received positive reviews by the mainstream video game media.

===Wargaming===
Several fanzines exist within the hobby of wargaming. Among them is &quot;Charge!&quot;, a leading international fanzine exclusively for miniature wargaming enthusiasts for the American Civil War period. Other fanzines support Warhammer and other popular rules sets.

===Sport===

The first association football fanzine is regarded as being &quot;Foul&quot;, a publication that ran between 1972 and 1976. In the UK, most Premier League or Football League football clubs have one or more fanzines which supplement, oppose and complement the club&#x27;s official magazine or matchday programme. A reasonably priced zine has a guaranteed audience, as is the culture of passion in being a football fan.

The longest running fanzine is &quot;The City Gent&quot;, produced by supporters of Bradford City FC, which first went on sale at Valley Parade in November 1984 and is now in its 26th season. Following close on its heels was Nike, Inc. which was first released in 1989. At the time it was not the first of its kind with &quot;Terrace Talk&quot; (York City), which was first published in November 1981 and &quot;Wanderers Worldwide&quot; (Bolton Wanderers) having already been established but since disappeared. In 1985 the emergent &quot;When Saturday Comes&quot; (a fanzine without a specific club focus that was subsequently launched as a mainstream magazine) promoted a &#x27;fanzine movement&#x27; that gave birth to many more club titles during the late 1980s which was something of a glory period for fanzines.

With the widespread availability of the Internet, much of the energy that was put into football fanzines subsequently went into the development of supporters&#x27; websites. Examples of other UK football fanzines include &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; (Sunderland), &quot;TOOFIF&quot; (Fulham), &quot;The Square Ball&quot; (Leeds United), &quot;4,000 Holes&quot; (Blackburn Rovers) and &quot;War of the Monster Trucks&quot; (a Sheffield Wednesday fanzine named after a local TV station elected not to show the final scenes of an unlikely cup victory). The Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers fanzine &#x27;A Kick up the Rs&#x27; was first published in August 1987 and is still issuing an average of 10 issues per season.

Fanzines are not exclusive to the top tiers of football however, with Northern Counties East League side Scarborough Athletic FC having a fanzine titled &quot;Abandon Chip!&quot;, a pun based on both the perilous situation of predecessor club Scarborough FC and that club&#x27;s sponsors, McCain.

And also away from the world of Football there were a number of established fanzines, for example Rugby league has such notable publications as &quot;Who The Hell Was St. George Anyway?&quot; Rugby League fanzine, by supporters of Doncaster RLFC and &quot;Scarlet Turkey&quot; of Salford City Reds.However, due to pressure from the Internet etc. these publications no longer exist in printed form. The title of World&#x27;s longest running Rugby League fanzine now belongs to &quot;The Aye of the Tigers&quot;, by Castleford Tigers supporters. The fanzine movement has even spread to the United States, where ice hockey fans have produced several popular fanzines. In Chicago two examples include the formerly published &quot;Blue Line Magazine&quot; and currently &quot;The Committed Indian&quot;, both produced by Chicago Blackhawks fans. In St. Louis there are &quot;Game Night Revue&quot; and &quot;St Louis Game Time&quot; for the St. Louis Blues.

There are also a number of fanzines to be found in Ireland of which Shelbourne&#x27;s &quot;Red Inc.&quot; has been running since 1999, and is the only one still in existence.

In the United States, sports fanzines are relatively rare. In Boston they are a bit more common. There are two fanzines sold outside Fenway Park including &quot;Yawkey Way Report&quot;, which is run by a former Marine.

==Recent developments==
With the increasing availability of the Internet in the late 20th and the early 21st century, the traditional paper zine has begun to give way to the webzine (or &quot;e-zine&quot;) that is easier to produce and uses the potential of the Internet to reach an ever-larger, possibly global, audience. Nonetheless, printed fanzines are still produced, either out of preference for the format or to reach people who do not have convenient Web access. Online versions of approximately 200 science fiction fanzines will be found at Bill Burns&#x27; eFanzines web site, along with links to other SF fanzine sites. In addition, zine festivals are held each year in American cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and Brooklyn, as well as internationally in cities including Melbourne, Australia, and Glasgow, UK.

<text>Forgotten Futures is a role-playing game created by Marcus Rowland to allow people to play in settings inspired by Victorian and Edwardian science fiction and fantasy (i.e., steampunk). Most of its releases begin with these stories then add background material to explain the settings (often as alternate worlds, whose history diverges from our own), adventures, and other game material.

==Game system==

The base system uses three characteristics (Body, Mind, and Soul) and a range of skills; points are used to purchase characteristics and skills based on one or more of the characteristics. Skills and characteristics are used by opposing them to a target (such as a difficulty number, an opponent&#x27;s skill or characteristics, etc.) using a 2D6 dice roll. Subsequent revisions to the rules add options including a Magic characteristic, melodramatic character traits, and other complications, but the core system remains unchanged.

Rowland is believed to have pioneered the concept of shareware tabletop role-playing games with this system, although there were earlier shareware computer games with role-playing elements. Users can download the rules from his web site, buy a subscription that entitles them to Forgotten Futures CDs, or buy a copy of the published version of this game. The CDs are also good sources for science fiction books and other period material whose copyright has expired. A proportion of his income from the game is donated to cancer research charities.

Currently several versions of the rules are on line (complete and summary versions in HTML and PDF, and a German translation in PDF), along with a sample adventure set in a Victorian Channel Tunnel, plus eleven game collections (source material plus background worldbook, adventures, etc.), with an expanding collection of additional resources on line and on the CD-ROM. The rules and sample adventure have twice been published in print; in brief form as a booklet given away with &quot;Arcane Magazine&quot; in 1997, and at full length by Heliograph Inc. in 1999.

In May 2016 Rowland announced that due to delays in the next release and changes in European tax law he would end shareware distribution of the game. Instead he intends to put all of the existing material on line, including the full contents of the CD, with a tip jar for voluntary contributions, and hopes to add more material. Users with current shareware registrations were offered a partial refund or the option to donate it to Cancer Research UK.

==Reception==
In the November 1994 edition of &quot;Pyramid&quot; (Issue #10), Ken and Jo Walton liked both the content of &quot;Forgotten Futures 2&quot; and the shareware concept, saying, &quot;This is an excellent, atmospheric, roleplaying game, made slightly unapproachable by its unusual distribution method. It is available only on disk; you unzip the file and print out the book for yourself. All text files are ASCII format, all pictures are GIFs.&quot;

In the March 1998 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 245), Allen Varney called &quot;Forgotten Futures&quot; &quot;A very substantial and admirable shareware RPG from one of Britain&#x27;s top designers, based on the British &#x27;scientific romances&#x27; popular a century ago.&quot; Varney also complimented Marcus Rowland for trying to keep those old &#x27;scientific romance&#x27; stories in circulation, saying, &quot;Aside from the game&#x27;s real virtues, this worthy mission makes &quot;Forgotten Futures&quot; a must for any fan of science fiction&#x27;s early history.&quot;

<text>Fabritio Caroso da Sermoneta (1526/1535 – 1605/1620) was an Italian Renaissance dancing master and a composer or transcriber of dance music.

His dance manual &quot;Il Ballarino&quot; was published in 1581, with a subsequent edition, significantly different, &quot;Nobiltà di Dame&quot;, printed in 1600 and again after his death in 1630. The work has been published in English as &quot;Courtly Dance of the Renaissance&quot; by Julia Sutton.

Both manuals have been printed in facsimile edition. Many of the dances of Fabritio Caroso&#x27;s manuals are meant for two dancers with a few for four or more dancers. These manuals offer a great deal of information to dance historians and musicologists alike in that each description of a dance is accompanied by music examples with lute tablature and directions about how each music example is to be played. Many of the dances also contain dedications to noble women of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.

<doc id="11104" wikidata="Q178888" url="?curid=11104" title="Fatah">
<text>Fatah ( ; ), formally the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (), is a Palestinian nationalist and social democratic political party. It is the largest faction of the confederated multi-party Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the second-largest party in the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC). Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, is the chairman of Fatah.

Fatah was historically involved in armed struggle against the state of Israel (as well as Jordan during the Black September conflict in 1970–1971) and maintained a number of militant groups, which carried out attacks against military targets as well as Israeli civllians, notably including the 1978 Coastal Road massacre, though the group disengaged from armed conflict against Israel around the time of the Oslo Accords, when it recognised Israel, which gave it limited control over the Occupied Palestinian territories. During the Second Intifada (2000–2005), Fatah intensified armed conflict against Israel, claiming responsibility for a number of suicide attacks. Fatah had been closely identified with the leadership of its founder and chairman, Yasser Arafat, until his death in 2004, when Farouk Kaddoumi constitutionally succeeded him to the position of Fatah Chairman and continued in the position until 2009, when Abbas was elected chairman. Since Arafat&#x27;s death, factionalism within the ideologically diverse movement has become more apparent.

In the 2006 election for the PLC, the party lost its majority in the PLC to Hamas. The Hamas legislative victory led to a conflict between Fatah and Hamas, with Fatah retaining control of the Palestinian National Authority in the West Bank through its president. Fatah is also active in the control of Palestinian refugee camps.

==Etymology==
The full name of the movement is , meaning the &quot;Palestinian National Liberation Movement&quot;. From this was crafted the inverted and reverse acronym (generally rendered in English as &quot;Fatah&quot;), meaning &quot;opening&quot;, &quot;conquering&quot;, or &quot;victory&quot;. The word is used in religious discourse to signify the Islamic expansion in the first centuries of Islamic history – as in , the &quot;conquering of the Levant&quot;. also has religious significance in that it is the name of the 48th &quot;sura&quot; (chapter) of the Quran which, according to major Muslim commentators, details the story of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. During the peaceful two years after the Hudaybiyyah treaty, many converted to Islam, increasing the strength of the Muslim side. It was the breach of this treaty by the Quraysh that triggered the conquest of Mecca. This Islamic precedent was cited by Yasser Arafat as justification for his signing the Oslo Accords with Israel.

==History==
===Establishment===
The Fatah movement was founded in 1959 by members of the Palestinian diaspora, principally by professionals working in the Persian Gulf States, especially Kuwait (then a British protectorate) where the founders Salah Khalaf, Khalil al-Wazir, Yasser Arafat resided. The founders had studied in Cairo or Beirut and had been refugees in Gaza. Salah Khalaf and Khalil al-Wazir were official members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Yasser Arafat had previously been head of the General Union of Palestinian Students (GUPS) at the Cairo University (1952–1956), whilst another co-founder, Khaled Yashruti, then a 22-year-old student, was the GUPS head in Beirut. Upon founding, Arafat summoned Mahmud Abbas (who was residing in Qatar, then a British protectorate) to join. The group of Gulf-based young Palestinian professionals were the core of Fatah in its early days of existence. Fatah espoused a Palestinian nationalist ideology in which Palestinian Arabs would be liberated by their own actions.

Immediately after its establishment the name of the movement was first used in &quot;Falastinuna&quot; which was the official media organ of the Fatah.

===1967–1993===
Fatah became the dominant force in Palestinian politics after the Six-Day War in 1967.

Fatah joined the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1967, and was allocated 33 of 105 seats in the PLO Executive Committee. Fatah&#x27;s Yasser Arafat became Chairman of the PLO in 1969, after the position was ceded to him by Yahya Hammuda. According to the BBC, &quot;Mr Arafat took over as chairman of the executive committee of the PLO in 1969, a year that Fatah is recorded to have carried out 2,432 guerrilla attacks on Israel.&quot;

====Battle of Karameh====
Throughout 1968, Fatah and other Palestinian armed groups were the target of a major Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) operation in the Jordanian village of Karameh, where the Fatah headquartersas well as a mid-sized Palestinian refugee campwere located. The town&#x27;s name is the Arabic word for &quot;dignity&quot;, which elevated its symbolism to the Arab people, especially after the Arab defeat in 1967. The operation was in response to attacks against Israel, including rockets strikes from Fatah and other Palestinian militias into the occupied West Bank. Knowledge of the operation was available well ahead of time, and the government of Jordan (as well as a number of Fatah commandos) informed Arafat of Israel&#x27;s large-scale military preparations. Upon hearing the news, many guerrilla groups in the area, including George Habash&#x27;s newly formed group the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Nayef Hawatmeh&#x27;s breakaway organization the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), withdrew their forces from the town. Fatah leaders were advised by a pro-Fatah Jordanian divisional commander to withdraw their men and headquarters to nearby hills, but on Arafat&#x27;s orders, Fatah remained, and the Jordanian Army agreed to back them if heavy fighting ensued.

On the night of 21 March, the IDF attacked Karameh with heavy weaponry, armored vehicles and fighter jets. Fatah held its ground, surprising the Israeli military. As Israel&#x27;s forces intensified their campaign, the Jordanian Army became involved, causing the Israelis to retreat in order to avoid a full-scale war. By the end of the battle, nearly 150 Fatah militants had been killed, as well as twenty Jordanian soldiers and twenty-eight Israeli soldiers. Despite the higher Arab death toll, Fatah considered themselves victorious because of the Israeli army&#x27;s rapid withdrawal.

====Black September====

In the late 1960s, tensions between Palestinians and the Jordanian government increased greatly; heavily armed Arab resistance elements had created a virtual &quot;state within a state&quot; in Jordan, eventually controlling several strategic positions in that country. After their victory in the Battle of Karameh, Fatah and other Palestinian militias began taking control of civil life in Jordan. They set up roadblocks, publicly humiliated Jordanian police forces, molested women and levied illegal taxes – all of which Arafat either condoned or ignored.

In 1970, the Jordanian government moved to regain control over its territory, and the next day, King Hussein declared martial law. By 25 September, the Jordanian army achieved dominance in the fighting, and two days later Arafat and Hussein agreed to a series of ceasefires. The Jordanian army inflicted heavy casualties upon the Palestinians – including civilians – who suffered approximately 3,500 fatalities. Two thousand Fatah fighters managed to enter Syria. They crossed the border into Lebanon to join Fatah forces in that country, where they set up their new headquarters. A large group of guerrilla fighters led by Fatah field commander Abu Ali Iyad held out the Jordanian Army&#x27;s offensive in the northern city of Ajlun until they were decisively defeated in July 1971. Abu Ali Iyad was executed and surviving members of his commando force formed the Black September Organization, a splinter group of Fatah. In November 1971, the group assassinated Jordanian prime minister Wasfi al-Tal as retaliation to Abu Ali Iyad&#x27;s execution.

In the 1960s and the 1970s, Fatah provided training to a wide range of European, Middle Eastern, Asian, and African militant and insurgent groups, and carried out numerous attacks against Israeli targets in Western Europe and the Middle East during the 1970s. Some militant groups that affiliated themselves to Fatah, and some of the &quot;fedayeen&quot; within Fatah itself, carried out civilian-aircraft hijackings and terrorist attacks, attributing them to Black September, Abu Nidal&#x27;s Fatah-Revolutionary Council, Abu Musa&#x27;s group, the PFLP, and the PFLP-GC. Fatah received weapons, explosives and training from the Soviet Union and some of the communist states of East Europe. China and Algeria also provided munitions. In 1979, Fatah aided Uganda during the Uganda–Tanzania War. Members of the organization fought alongside the Uganda Army and Libyan troops against the Tanzania People&#x27;s Defence Force during the Battle of Lukaya and the Fall of Kampala, but were eventually forced to retreat from the country.

====Lebanon====

Since the death of Eljamal in 1968, the Palestinian cause had a large base of supporters in Lebanon.

Although hesitant at first to take sides in the conflict, Arafat and Fatah played an important role in the Lebanese Civil War. Succumbing to pressure from PLO sub-groups such as the PFLP, DFLP and the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), Fatah aligned itself with the communist and Nasserist Lebanese National Movement (LNM). Although originally aligned with Fatah, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad feared a loss of influence in Lebanon and switched sides. He sent his army, along with the Syrian-backed Palestinian factions of as-Sa&#x27;iqa and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC) led by Ahmad Jibril to fight alongside the Christian forces against the PLO and the LNM. The primary component of the Christian militias was the Maronite Phalangists.

Phalangist forces killed twenty-six Fatah trainees on a bus in April 1975, marking the official start of the 15-year-long Lebanese civil war. Later that year, an alliance of Christian militias overran the Palestinian refugee camp of Karantina killing over 1,000 civilians. The PLO and LNM retaliated by attacking the town of Damour, a Phalangist and Tigers (Ahrar) stronghold, killing 684 civilians. As the civil war progressed over 2 years of urban warfare, both parties resorted to massive artillery duels and heavy use of sniper nests, while atrocities and war crimes were committed by both sides.

In 1976, with strategic planning help from the Lebanese Army, the alliance of Christian militias, spearheaded by the National Liberal Party of former President Cammille Chamoun militant branch, the noumour el ahrar (NLP Tigers), took a pivotal refugee camp in the Eastern part of Beirut, the Tel al-Zaatar camp, after a six-month siege, also known as Tel al-Zaatar massacre in which hundreds perished. Arafat and Abu Jihad blamed themselves for not successfully organizing a rescue effort.

PLO cross-border raids against Israel grew somewhat during the late 1970s. One of the most severeknown as the Coastal Road massacreoccurred on 11 March 1978. A force of nearly a dozen Fatah fighters landed their boats near a major coastal road connecting the city of Haifa with Tel Aviv-Yafo. There they hijacked a bus and sprayed gunfire inside and at passing vehicles, killing thirty-seven civilians. In response, the IDF launched Operation Litani three days later, with the goal of taking control of Southern Lebanon up to the Litani River. The IDF achieved this goal, and Fatah withdrew to the north into Beirut.

Israel invaded Lebanon again in 1982. Beirut was soon besieged and bombarded by the IDF; to end the siege, the US and European governments brokered an agreement guaranteeing safe passage for Arafat and Fatahguarded by a multinational forceto exile in Tunis. Despite the exile, many Fatah commanders and fighters remained in Lebanon, and they faced the War of the Camps in the 1980s in their fight with the Shia Amal Movement and also in connection with internal schisms within the Palestinian factions.
===After 1993===

====Presidential and legislative elections====
In the 1993–1995 Oslo Accords, Fatah, as part of the PLO, made some interim agreements with Israel, including recognition of Israel by the PLO. Until his 2004 death, Arafat headed the Palestinian National Authority, the provisional entity created as a result of those Oslo Accords. Soon after Arafat&#x27;s death, Farouk Kaddoumi was elected to the post, which he continues to hold.

Fatah nominated Mahmoud Abbas in the Palestinian presidential election of 2005.

In 2005, Hamas won in nearly all the municipalities it contested. Political analyst Salah Abdel-Shafi told the BBC about the difficulties of Fatah leadership: &quot;I think it&#x27;s very, very seriousit&#x27;s becoming obvious that they can&#x27;t agree on anything.&quot; Fatah is &quot;widely seen as being in desperate need of reform,&quot; as &quot;the PA&#x27;s performance has been a story of corruption and incompetenceand Fatah has been tainted.&quot;

====Internal discord====

In December 2005, jailed Intifada leader Marwan Barghouti broke ranks with the party and announced that he had formed a new political list to run in the elections called the &quot;al-Mustaqbal&quot; (&quot;The Future&quot;), mainly composed of members of Fatah&#x27;s &quot;Young Guard.&quot; These younger leaders have repeatedly expressed frustration with the entrenched corruption in the party, which has been run by the &quot;Old Guard&quot; who returned from exile in Tunisia following the Oslo Accords. Al-Mustaqbal was to campaign against Fatah in the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, presenting a list including Mohammed Dahlan, Kadoura Fares, Samir Mashharawi and Jibril Rajoub. However, on 28 December 2005, the leadership of the two factions agreed to submit a single list to voters, headed by Barghouti, who began actively campaigning for Fatah from his jail cell.

There have been numerous other expressions of discontent within Fatah, which is just holding its first general congress in two decades. Because of this, the movement remains largely dominated by aging cadres from the pre-Oslo era of Palestinian politics. Several of them gained their positions through the patronage of Yasser Arafat, who balanced above the different factions, and the era after his death in 2004 has seen increased infighting among these groups, who jockey for influence over future development, the political line, funds, and constituencies. There is concern over the succession once Abbas leaves power.
There have been no open splits within the older generation of Fatah politicians since the 1980s, though there is occasional friction between members of the top leadership. One founding member, Faruq al-Qaddumi (Abu Lutf), continues to openly oppose the post-Oslo arrangements and has intensified his campaign for a more hardline position from exile in Tunis. Since Arafat&#x27;s death, he is formally head of Fatah&#x27;s political bureau and chairman, but his actual political following within Fatah appears limited. He has at times openly challenged the legitimacy of Abbas and harshly criticized both him and Mohammed Dahlan, but despite threats to splinter the movement, he remains in his position, and his challenges have so far been fruitless. Another influential veteran, Hani al-Hassan, has also openly criticized the present leadership.

Fatah&#x27;s internal conflicts have also, due to the creation of the Palestinian Authority, merged with the turf wars between different PA security services, e.g., a longstanding rivalry between the West Bank (Jibril Rajoub) and Gaza (Muhammad Dahlan) branches of the powerful Preventive Security Service. Foreign backing for different factions contribute to conflict, e.g., with the United States generally seen as supportive of Abbas&#x27;s overall leadership and of Dahlan&#x27;s security influence, and Syria alleged to promote Faruq al-Qaddumi&#x27;s challenge to the present leadership. The younger generations of Fatah, especially within the militant al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades, have been more prone to splits, and a number of lesser networks in Gaza and the West Bank have established themselves as either independent organizations or joined Hamas. However, such overt breaks with the movement have still been rather uncommon, despite numerous rivalries inside and between competing local Fatah groups.

====2009: Sixth General Assembly====
The Sixth General Assembly of the Fatah Movement began on 4 August 2009 in Bethlehem, nearly 16 years after the Oslo I Accord and 20 years since the last Fatah convention, after being repeatedly postponed over conflicts ranging from representation to venue. More than 2,000 delegates attended the meeting, while another 400 from the Gaza Strip were unable to attend the conference after Hamas barred them from traveling to the West Bank.

The internal dissension was immediately obvious. Saudi King Abdullah told the delegates that divisions among the Palestinians were more damaging to their cause of an independent state than the Israeli &quot;enemy&quot;.

Delegates resolved not to resume Israeli-Palestinian peace talks until 14 preconditions were met. Among these preconditions were the release of all Israel-held Palestinian prisoners, a freeze on all Israeli settlement construction, and an end to the Gaza blockade.

By affirming its option for &quot;armed resistance&quot; against Israel, Fatah appealed to Palestinians who wanted a more hardline response to Israel.

Israeli deputy foreign minister Danny Ayalon said the conference was a &quot;serious blow to peace&quot; and &quot;was another lost opportunity for the Palestinian leadership to adopt moderate views.&quot;

====Elections to Central Committee and Revolutionary Council====
On 9 August 2009, new members of the Central Committee of Fatah and the Revolutionary Council were chosen. Delegates voted to fill 18 seats on the 23-seat Central Committee, and 81 seats on the 128-seat Revolutionary Council after a week of deliberations. At least 70 new members entered the latter, with 20 seats going to Fatah representatives from the Gaza Strip, 11 seats filled by women (the highest number of votes went to one woman who spent years in Israeli jails for her role in the resistance), four seats went to Christians, and one was filled by a Jewish-born convert to Islam, Uri Davis, the first Jewish-born person to be elected to the Revolutionary Council since its founding in 1958. Fatah activists from the Palestinian diaspora were also represented and included Samir Rifai, Fatah&#x27;s secretary in Syria, and Khaled Abu Usba.

Elected to the central council was Fadwa Barghouti, the wife of Marwan Barghouti who was serving five life sentences in Israel for his role in terrorist attacks on civilians in Israel during the Second Intifada.

====Reconciliation process with Hamas====

A meeting of the Revolutionary Council was held in Ramallah from 18 to 19 October 2014. Many important questions were discussed, including reconciliation with Hamas. Opinion was divided on this issue.

====2016: Seventh Congress====
In December 2016, more than 1400 members of Fatah&#x27;s 7th Congress elected 18 members of the Central Committee and 80 for the Revolutionary Council. Six new members were added to the Central Committee while 12 were reelected. Outgoing members included Nabil Shaath, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, Zakaria al-Agha and Tayib Abdul Rahim.

Its leader Abu Ashraf Al-Armoushi and his comrades were killed in the Al-Basateen neighborhood of Ain Al-Helweh camp on 30 July 2023 during a fighting.

==Ideology==
Fatah has &quot;Member Party&quot; status at the Socialist International and has &quot;Observer Party&quot; status within the Party of European Socialists.

The November 1959 edition of Fatah&#x27;s underground journal &quot;Filastinuna Nida al-Hayat&quot; indicated that the movement was motivated by the status of the Palestinian refugees in the Arab world:
:The youth of the catastrophe (&quot;shibab al-nakba&quot;) are dispersed... Life in the tent has become as miserable as death... [T]o die for our beloved Motherland is better and more honorable than life, which forces us to eat our daily bread under humiliations or to receive it as charity at the cost of our honour... We, the sons of the catastrophe, are no longer willing to live this dirty, despicable life, this life which has destroyed our cultural, moral and political existence and destroyed our human dignity.
Armed struggleas manifested in the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine and the military role of Palestinian fighters under the leadership of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni in the 1948 Arab–Israeli Warwas central to Fatah&#x27;s initial ideology of how to liberate Palestine.

==Structure==
Fatah&#x27;s two most important decision-making bodies are the Central Committee and Revolutionary Council. The Central Committee is mainly an executive body, while the Revolutionary Council is Fatah&#x27;s legislative body.

===Armed factions===
Fatah has maintained a number of militant groups since its founding. Its mainstream military branch is al-&#x27;Asifah. Fatah is generally considered to have had a strong involvement in terrorism in the past, though unlike its rival Islamist faction Hamas, Fatah is no longer regarded as a terrorist organization by any government. Fatah used to be designated terrorist under Israeli law and was considered terrorist by the United States Department of State and United States Congress until it renounced terrorism in 1988.

Fatah has, since its inception, created, led or sponsored a number of armed groups and militias, some of which have had an official standing as the movement&#x27;s armed wing, and some of which have not been publicly or even internally recognized as such. The group has also dominated various PLO and Palestinian Authority forces and security services which were/are not officially tied to Fatah, but in practice have served as wholly pro-Fatah armed units, and been staffed largely by members. The original name for Fatah&#x27;s armed wing was al-&#x27;Asifah (&quot;The Storm&quot;), and this was also the name Fatah first used in its communiques, trying for some time to conceal its identity. This name has since been applied more generally to Fatah armed forces, and does not correspond to a single unit today. Other militant groups associated with Fatah include:
*Force 17. Plays a role akin to the Presidential Guard for senior Fatah leaders. Created by Yasser Arafat.
*Black September Organization. A group formed by leading Fatah members in 1971, following the events of the &quot;Black September&quot; in Jordan, to organize clandestine attacks with which Fatah did not want to be openly associated. These included strikes against leading Jordanian politicians as a means of exacting vengeance and raising the price for attacking the Palestinian movement; and also, most controversially, for &quot;international operations&quot; (e.g. the Munich Olympics massacre), intended to put pressure on the US, Europe and Israel, to raise the visibility of the Palestinian cause and to upstage radical rivals such as the PFLP. Fatah publicly disassociated itself from the group, but it is widely believed that it enjoyed Arafat&#x27;s direct or tacit backing. It was discontinued in 1973–1974, as Fatah&#x27;s political line shifted again, and the Black September operations and the strategy behind them were seen as having become a political liability, rather than an asset.
*Fatah Hawks. An armed militia active mainly until the mid-1990s.
*Tanzim. A branch of Fatah under the leadership of Marwan Barghouti, with roots in the activism of the First Intifada, which carried out armed attacks in the early days of the Second Intifada. It was later subsumed or sidelined by the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades.
*Al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades. Created during the Second Intifada to bolster the organization&#x27;s militant standing vis-à-vis the rival Hamas movement, which had taken the lead in attacks on Israel after 1993, and was gaining rapidly in popularity with the advent of the Intifada. The Brigades are locally organized and have been said to suffer from poor cohesion and internal discipline, at times ignoring ceasefires and other initiatives announced by the central Fatah leadership. They are generally seen as tied to the &quot;young guard&quot; of Fatah politics, organizing young members on the street level, but it is not clear that they form a faction in themselves inside Fatah politics; rather, different Brigades units may be tied to different Fatah factional leaders.

During the Second Intifada, the group was a member of the Palestinian National and Islamic Forces.

===Constitution===
In August 2009, at Fatah&#x27;s Sixth General Conference in Bethlehem, Fatah delegates drew up a new &quot;internal charter&quot;.

<text>The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger and improve nutrition and food security. Its Latin motto, , translates to &quot;let there be bread&quot;. It was founded on 16 October 1945.

The FAO comprises 195 members, including 194 countries and the European Union. Its headquarters is in Rome, Italy, and it maintains regional and field offices worldwide, operating in over 130 countries. It helps governments and development agencies coordinate their activities to improve and develop agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and land and water resources. It also conducts research, provides technical assistance to projects, operates educational and training programs, and collects agricultural output, production, and development data.

The FAO is governed by a biennial conference representing each member country and the European Union, which elects a 49-member executive council. The director-general, as of 2019 Qu Dongyu of China, serves as the chief administrative officer. Various committees govern matters such as finance, programs, agriculture, and fisheries. 

== History ==
The idea of an international organization for food and agriculture emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century, advanced primarily by Polish-born American agriculturalist and activist David Lubin. In May–June 1905, an international conference was held in Rome, Italy, which led to the creation of the International Institute of Agriculture (IIA) by the King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel III.

The IIA was the first intergovernmental organization to deal with the problems and challenges of agriculture on a global scale. It worked primarily to collect, compile, and publish data on agriculture, ranging from output statistics to a catalog of crop diseases. Among its achievements was the publication of the first agricultural census in 1930.

World War II effectively ended the IIA. During the war, in 1943, United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt called a League of Nations Conference on Food and Agriculture, which brought representatives from forty-four governments to The Omni Homestead Resort in Hot Springs, Virginia, from 18 May to 3 June to attend the Hot Springs Conference. The main impetus for the conference was the British-born Australian economist Frank L. McDougall, who since 1935 had advocated for an international forum to address hunger and malnutrition.

The Conference ended with a commitment to establish a permanent organization for food and agriculture, which was achieved on 16 October 1945 in Quebec City, Canada, following the Constitution of the Food and Agriculture Organization. The first session of the FAO Conference began the same day in the Château Frontenac in Quebec City and ended on 1 November 1945. This was led by Sir John Boyd Orr where his work on ending world hunger and creation of FAO resulted in him winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1949.

After the war, the IIA was officially dissolved by resolution of its Permanent Committee on 27 February 1948. Its functions, facilities, and mandate were then transferred to the newly established FAO, which maintained its headquarters in Rome.

The FAO&#x27;s initial functions supported agricultural and nutrition research and provided technical assistance to member countries to boost production in agriculture, fishery, and forestry. Beginning in the 1960s, it focused on efforts to develop high-yield strains of grain, eliminate protein deficiency, promote rural employment, and increase agricultural exports. The FAO recognized the decrease of these resources as an urgent problem in 1961 and created a joint collaboration with the International Biological Program (IBP) in 1967. To that end, it joined the UN General Assembly in creating the UN World Food Programme, the largest humanitarian organization addressing hunger and promoting food security.
The FAO launched what would become the FAO Money and Medals Programme (MMP) in 1968. FAO issued collector art medals in various series to bring attention to FAO&#x27;s goals and missions. This program was responsible for over a hundred medal designs issued to the collecting public. A thirtieth anniversary medal of the MMP was issued in 1998.

In 1974, in response to famine in Africa, the FAO convened the first World Food Summit to address widespread hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity. The meeting resulted in a proclamation that &quot;every man, woman, and child has the inalienable right to be free from hunger and malnutrition to develop their physical and mental faculties&quot; and a global commitment to eradicate these issues within a decade. A subsequent summit in 1996 addressed the shortcomings in achieving this goal while establishing a strategic plan for eliminating hunger and malnutrition into the 21st century.

Every year, FAO publishes a number of major &#x27;State of the World&#x27; reports related to food, agriculture, forestry, fisheries and natural resources.

==Structure and finance==


In 1951, the FAO&#x27;s headquarters were moved from Washington, D.C., United States, to Rome, Italy. The agency is directed by the Conference of Member Nations, which meets every two years to review the work carried out by the organization and to Work and Budget for the next two-year period. The conference elects a council of 49 member states (serve three-year rotating terms) that acts as an interim governing body, and the director-general, who heads the agency.

The FAO is composed of eight departments: Agriculture and Consumer Protection, Climate, Biodiversity, Land and Water Department, Economic and Social Development, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Forestry, Corporate Services and Technical Cooperation and Programme Management.

Beginning in 1994, the FAO underwent the most significant restructuring since its founding, to decentralize operations, streamline procedures and reduce costs. As a result, savings of about US$50 million, €43 million a year were realized.

===Budget===
The FAO&#x27;s Regular Programme budget is funded by its members, through contributions set at the FAO Conference. This budget covers core technical work, cooperation and partnerships including the Technical Cooperation Programme, knowledge exchange, policy and advocacy, direction and administration, governance and security.

The total FAO Budget planned for 2018–2019 is US$1,005.6 million. The voluntary contributions provided by members and other partners support mechanical and emergency (including rehabilitation) assistance to governments for clearly defined purposes linked to the results framework, as well as direct support to FAO&#x27;s core work. The voluntary contributions are expected to reach approximately US$1.6 billion in 2016–2017.

This overall budget covers core technical work, cooperation and partnerships, leading to Food and Agriculture Outcomes at 71 percent; Core Functions at 11 percent; the Country Office Network – 5 percent; Capital and Security Expenditure – 2 percent; Administration – 6 percent; and Technical and Cooperation Program – 5 percent.

==Priority work areas==
FAO has outlined the following priorities in its fight against hunger.
* Help eliminate hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition – contribute to eradicating hunger by facilitating policies and political commitments to support food security and make sure that up-to-date information about hunger and nutrition challenges and solutions is available and accessible.
* Make agriculture, forestry, and fisheries more productive and sustainable – promote evidence-based policies and practices to support highly productive agricultural sectors (crops, livestock, forestry, and fisheries) while ensuring that the natural resource base does not suffer in the process.
* Reduce rural poverty by helping the rural poor gain access to the resources and services they need, including rural employment and social protection.
* Enable inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems – helping to build safe and efficient food systems that support smallholder agriculture and reduce poverty and hunger in rural areas.
* Increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises – helping countries to prepare for natural and human-caused disasters by reducing their risk and enhancing the resilience of their food and agricultural systems.
Two fundamental areas of work – gender and governance – are fully integrated in the above strategic objective action plans.

==Programmes and achievements==
=== Food ===

=== &quot;Codex Alimentarius&quot; ===
FAO and the World Health Organization created the Codex Alimentarius Commission in 1961 to develop food standards, guidelines, and texts such as codes of practice under the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme. The programme&#x27;s main aims are protecting consumer health, ensuring fair trade, and promoting co-ordination of all food standards work undertaken by intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations.

==== World Food Summit ====
In 1996, FAO organized the World Food Summit, attended by 112 Heads or Deputy Heads of State and Government. The Summit concluded with the signing of the Rome Declaration, which established the goal of halving the number of people who suffer from hunger by 2015. At the same time, 1,200 civil society organizations (CSOs) from 80 countries participated in an NGO forum. The forum was critical of the growing industrialization of agriculture and called upon governments – and FAO – to do more to protect the &#x27;Right to Food&#x27; for the poor.

==== TeleFood ====
In 1997, FAO launched TeleFood, a campaign of concerts, sporting events, and other activities to harness the power of media, celebrities, and concerned citizens to help fight hunger. Since its start, the campaign has generated close to US$28 million, €15 million in donations. Money raised through TeleFood pays for small, sustainable projects that help small-scale farmers produce more food for their families and communities.

The projects provide tangible resources, such as fishing equipment, seeds, and agricultural implements. They vary enormously, from helping families raise pigs in Venezuela through creating school gardens in Cape Verde and Mauritania or providing school lunches in Uganda and teaching children to grow food to raising fish in a leper community in India.

==== FAO Goodwill Ambassadors ====
The FAO Goodwill Ambassadors Programme was initiated in 1999. It was created to increase public awareness and disseminate information about issues related to food security and hunger in the world.

==== Right to Food Guidelines ====
In 2004 the Right to Food Guidelines were adopted which offer guidance to states on how to implement their obligations on the right to food.

==== Response to food crisis ====
In December 2007, FAO launched its Initiative on soaring food prices to help small producers raise their output and earn more. Under the initiative, FAO contributed to the work of the UN High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis, which produced the Comprehensive Framework for Action. FAO has carried out projects in over 25 countries and inter-agency missions in nearly 60, scaled up its monitoring through the Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture, provided policy advice to governments while supporting their efforts to increase food production, and advocated for more investment in agriculture as well as provided funding to distribute and multiply quality seeds in Haiti, which has significantly increased food production, thereby providing cheaper food.

==== FAO–EU partnership ====
In May 2009, FAO and the European Union signed an initial aid package worth €125 million to support small farmers in countries hit hard by rising food prices. The aid package falls under the EU&#x27;s €1 billion Food Facility, set up with the UN Secretary-General&#x27;s High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis and FAO to focus on programmes that will have a quick but lasting impact on food security. FAO is receiving around €200 million for work in 25 countries, of which €15.4 million goes to Zimbabwe.

==== Food security programmes ====
The Special Programme for Food Security is FAO&#x27;s flagship initiative for reaching the goal of halving the number of hungry in the world by 2015 (currently estimated at close to 1 billion people) as part of its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. Through projects in over 100 countries worldwide, the programme promotes effective, tangible solutions to eliminating hunger, undernourishment, and poverty. Currently, 102 countries are engaged in the programme, and of these, approximately 30 have begun shifting from pilot to national programmes. To maximize the impact of its work, FAO strongly promotes national ownership and local empowerment in the countries in which it operates.

==== Online campaign against hunger ====
The 1billionhungry project became the EndingHunger campaign in April 2011. Spearheaded by FAO in partnership with other UN agencies and private nonprofit groups, the EndingHunger movement pushes the boundaries of conventional public advocacy. It builds on the success in 2010 of The 1billonhungry project and the subsequent chain of public events that led to the collection of over three million signatures on a global petition to end hunger (www.EndingHunger.org). The petition was originally presented to representatives of world governments at a ceremony in Rome on 30 November 2010.

The web and partnerships are two pivotal and dynamic aspects of EndingHunger. The campaign relies on the assistance of organizations and institutions that can facilitate the project&#x27;s diffusion, by placing banners on their own websites or organizing events aimed to raise awareness of the project. In its 2011 season, the campaign expanded its multimedia content, pursued mutual visibility arrangements with partner organizations, and sharpened its focus on 14- to 25-year-olds, who were encouraged to understand their potential as a social movement to push for the end of hunger.

Moreover, the EndingHunger project is a viral communication campaign, renewing and expanding its efforts to build the movement through Facebook, Twitter and other social networks. Those who sign the petition can spread the link of the EndingHunger website to their friends, via social media or mail, in order to gain awareness and signatures for the petition. The next interim objective is to grow the EndingHunger movement&#x27;s Facebook community to 1 million members. As with the petition, the more people who get involved, the more powerful the message to governments: &quot;We are no longer willing to accept the fact that hundreds of millions live in chronic hunger.&quot; Groups and individuals can also decide on their own to organize an event about the project, simply by gathering friends, whistles, T-shirts and banners (whistles and T-shirts can be ordered, and petition sign sheets downloaded, on the endinghunger.org website) and thereby alert people about chronic hunger by using the yellow whistle.

The original 1billionhungry campaign borrowed as its slogan the line &quot;I&#x27;m as mad as hell, and I&#x27;m not going to take this anymore!&quot;, used by Peter Finch in the 1976 film, &quot;Network&quot;. Meanwhile, the yellow whistle has been the campaign symbol from the start, from 1billionhungry to Ending Hunger. (The creative concept was provided by the McCann Erickson Italy Communication Agency.) It symbolizes the fact that we are &quot;blowing the whistle&quot; on the silent disaster of hunger. It is both a symbol and – at many live events taking place around the world – a physical means of expressing frustration and making some noise about the hunger situation.

Both The 1billionhungry and the EndingHunger campaigns have continued to attract UN Goodwill Ambassadors from the worlds of music and cinema, literature, sport, activism and government. Some of the well known individuals who have become involved include former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, former presidents of Chile Ricardo Lagos and Michelle Bachelet, actress Susan Sarandon, actors Jeremy Irons and Raul Bova, singers Céline Dion and Anggun, authors Isabelle Allende and Andrea Camilleri, musician Chucho Valdés and Olympic track-and-field legend Carl Lewis.

=== Agriculture ===
==== International Plant Protection Convention ====
FAO created the International Plant Protection Convention or IPPC in 1952. This international treaty organization works to prevent the international spread of pests and plant diseases in both cultivated and wild plants. Among its functions are the maintenance of lists of plant pests, tracking of pest outbreaks, and coordination of technical assistance between member nations. As of July 2018, 183 contracting parties have ratified the treaty.

====Plant Treaty (ITPGRFA)====
FAO is depositary of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, also called &quot;Plant Treaty&quot;, &quot;Seed Treaty&quot; or &quot;ITPGRFA&quot;, entered into force on 29 June 2004.

==== Alliance Against Hunger and Malnutrition ====

The Alliance Against Hunger and Malnutrition (AAHM) aims to address how countries and organizations can be more effective in advocating and carrying out actions to address hunger and malnutrition. As a global partnership, AAHM creates global connections between local, regional, national and international institutions that share the goals of fighting hunger and malnutrition. The organization works to address food security by enhancing resources and knowledge sharing and strengthening hunger activities within countries and across state lines at the regional and international levels.

Following the World Food Summit, the Alliance was initially created in 2002 as the &#x27;International Alliance Against Hunger (IAAH)&#x27; to strengthen and coordinate national efforts in the fight against hunger and malnutrition. The mission of the Alliance originates from the first and eighth UN Millennium Development Goals; reducing the number of people that suffer from hunger in half by 2015 (preceded by the &quot;Rome Declaration&quot; in 1996) and developing a global partnership for development. The Alliance was founded by the Rome-based food agencies – the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), UN World Food Programme (WFP), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), – and Bioversity International.

AAHM connects top-down and bottom-up anti-hunger development initiatives, linking governments, UN organizations, and NGOs together in order to increase effectiveness through unity.

==== Integrated pest management ====
During the 1990s, FAO took a leading role in the promotion of integrated pest management for rice production in Asia. Hundreds of thousands of farmers were trained using an approach known as the Farmer Field School (FFS). Like many of the programmes managed by FAO, the funds for Farmer Field Schools came from bilateral Trust Funds, with Australia, Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland acting as the leading donors. FAO&#x27;s efforts in this area have drawn praise from NGOs that have otherwise criticized much of the work of the organization.

==== Trans-boundary pests and diseases ====
FAO established an &quot;Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases&quot; in 1994, focusing on the control of diseases like rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease and avian flu by helping governments coordinate their responses. One key element is the &quot;Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme&quot;, which has advanced to a stage where large tracts of Asia and Africa have now been free of the cattle disease rinderpest for an extended period of time. Meanwhile, the &quot;&quot; monitors the worldwide locust situation and keeps affected countries and donors informed of expected developments.

==== Global Partnership Initiative for Plant Breeding Capacity Building ====
The Global Partnership Initiative for Plant Breeding Capacity Building (GIPB) is a global partnership dedicated to increasing plant breeding capacity building. The mission of GIPB is to enhance the capacity of developing countries to improve crops for food security and sustainable development through better plant breeding and delivery systems. The ultimate goal is to ensure that a critical mass of plant breeders, leaders, managers and technicians, donors and partners are linked together through an effective global network.

Increasing capacity building for plant breeding in developing countries is critical for the achievement of meaningful results in poverty and hunger reduction and to reverse the current worrisome trends. Plant breeding is a well recognized science capable of widening the genetic and adaptability base of cropping systems, by combining conventional selection techniques and modern technologies. It is essential to face and prevent the recurrence of crises such as that
of the soaring food prices and to respond to the increasing demands for crop based sources of energy.

==== Investment in agriculture ====
FAO&#x27;s technical cooperation department hosts an Investment Centre that promotes greater investment in agriculture and rural development by helping developing countries identify and formulate sustainable agricultural policies, programmes and projects. It mobilizes funding from multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, regional development banks and international funds as well as FAO resources.

==== Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) ====

The Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) Partnership Initiative was conceptualized and presented by Parviz Koohafkan the Task Manager of Chapter 10 of Agenda 21 in Food and Agricultural Organization of United Nations, FAO in 2002 during World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa. This UN Partnership Initiative aims to identify, support and safeguard Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems and their livelihoods, agricultural and associated biodiversity, landscapes, knowledge systems and cultures around the world. The GIAHS Partnership recognizes the crucial importance of the well-being of family farming communities in an integrated approach while directing activities towards sustainable agriculture and rural development.

==== Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (CGRFA) ====
The Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, established in 1983, provides an intergovernmental forum that specifically addresses biological diversity for food and agriculture. Its main objective is to ensure the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity for food and agriculture and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from its use, for present and future generations.

====Animal Genetic Resources====
FAO has a unit focused on Animal Genetic Resources, which are defined as &quot;those animal species that are used, or may be used, for the production of food and agriculture, and the populations within each of them. These populations within each species can be classified as wild and feral populations, land-races and primary populations, standardized breeds, selected lines, varieties, strains and any conserved genetic material; all of which are currently categorized as Breeds.&quot; FAO assists countries in implementation of the Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources. FAO supports a variety of &quot;ex situ&quot; and &quot;in situ&quot; conservation strategies including cryoconservation of animal genetic resources.

=== Forestry ===
One of FAO&#x27;s strategic goals is the sustainable management of the world&#x27;s forests. The &quot;Forestry Division&quot; works to balance social and environmental considerations with the economic needs of rural populations living in forest areas. FAO serves as a neutral forum for policy dialogue, as a reliable source of information on forests and trees and as a provider of expert technical assistance and advice to help countries develop and implement effective national forest programmes.

FAO is both a global clearinghouse for information on forests and forest resources and a facilitator that helps building countries&#x27; local capacity to provide their own national forest data. In collaboration with member countries, FAO carries out periodic global assessments of forest resources, which are made available through reports, publications and the FAO&#x27;s Web site. The &quot;Global Forest Resources Assessment&quot; provides comprehensive reporting on forests worldwide every five years. FRA 2020 is the most recent global assessment. The results, data and analyses are available online in different formats, including key findings, main report and country reports.

Every two years, FAO publishes the &quot;State of the World&#x27;s Forests&quot;, a major report covering current and emerging issues facing the forestry sector.

Since 1947, FAO has published the FAO Yearbook of Forest Products, a compilation of statistical data on basic forest products from over 100 countries and territories of the world. It contains data on the volume of production; and the volume, value and direction of trade in forest products.

&quot;Unasylva&quot;, FAO&#x27;s peer-reviewed journal on forestry, has been published in English, French and Spanish on a regular basis since 1947, the longest-running multilingual forestry journal in the world.

The FAO is an official sponsor of International Day of Forests, on 21 March each year, as proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly on 28 November 2012.

Every six years since 1926, FAO and a host member state hold the World Forestry Congress. It is a forum for the sharing of knowledge and experience regarding the conservation, management and use of the world&#x27;s forests, and covers such issues as international dialogue, socio-economic and institutional aspects, and forest policies.

The Forestry Department is also organized geographically in several groups covering the whole world&#x27;s forest ecosystems. One of them is the Silva Mediterranean work-group, covering the pan-Mediterranean region.

====Tree Cities of the World====

At the World Forum on Urban Forests in October 2018, the FAO and the Arbor Day Foundation jointly launched the Tree Cities of the World programme. The aim of this programme is to celebrate and recognize cities and towns of all sizes throughout the world which have shown a commitment to maintaining their urban forests. From the end of 2019, any municipality which has responsibility for its trees was able to apply to join Tree Cities of the World. On 4 February 2020, 59 cities were announced as having achieved the designation of Tree City of the World. There were 27 in the United States, with the rest scattered across the world.

=== Fisheries ===

The FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department is defined through its vision and mission statements:
* &quot;Vision&quot;: A world in which responsible and sustainable use of fisheries and aquaculture resources makes an appreciable contribution to human well-being, food security and poverty alleviation.
* &quot;Mission&quot;: To strengthen global governance and the managerial and technical capacities of members and to lead consensus-building towards improved conservation and utilization of aquatic resources.

The work of the Fisheries and Aquaculture Department centers on the &quot;Sustainable management and use of fisheries and aquaculture resource&quot;, embracing normative as well as operational activities, whether implemented from headquarters or from the field.

The FAO &quot;Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries&quot; was adopted in 1995.

=== Statistics ===
ESSG is an acronym for the Global Statistics Service, the major &quot;section&quot; of the United Nations&#x27; Food and Agriculture Organization - Statistics Division. It is responsible for updating and disseminating the FAOSTAT report. This offers free and easy access to data for 245 countries and 35 regional areas from 1961 through the most recent year available. Enhanced features include browsing and analysis of data, an advanced interactive data download, and enhanced data exchange through web services.

The Land and Water Division maintains a database of global water statistics, Aquastat. The Fisheries and Aquaculture Division maintains a database of global Fisheries and Aquaculture statistics, FishStat.

Taiwan (at the time representing China), withdrew from the FAO in 1951. in 1971, the People&#x27;s Republic of China was recognized as the representative of China by the FAO and the withdrawal from part of Taiwan was not taken into account.

The only UN member state that is a non-member of the FAO is Liechtenstein.

Both UN observer states are also non-members of the FAO: the Holy See (Vatican City) and Palestine.

Some countries may denote specific representatives to the FAO, for instance the United States Ambassador to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, who has ambassador rank and is also a part of the United States Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome.

==Criticism==
===1970s, 80s, 90s===
There has been public criticism of FAO for at least 30 years. Dissatisfaction with the organization&#x27;s performance was among the reasons for the creation of two new organizations after the World Food Conference in 1974, namely the World Food Council and the International Fund for Agricultural Development; by the early eighties there was intense rivalry among these organizations. At the same time, the World Food Programme, which started as an experimental three-year programme under FAO, was growing in size and independence, with the Directors of FAO and WFP struggling for power.

Early in 1989, the organization came under attack from Heritage Foundation, an American conservative think tank, which described the FAO as becoming &quot;essentially irrelevant in combating hunger&quot; due to a &quot;bloated bureaucracy known for the mediocrity of its work and the inefficiency of its staff&quot;, which had become politicized. In September of the same year, the journal &quot;Society&quot; published a series of articles about FAO that included a contribution from the Heritage Foundation and a response by FAO staff member, Richard Lydiker, who was later described by the Danish Minister for Agriculture (who had herself resigned from the organization) as &quot;FAO&#x27;s chief spokesman for non-transparency&quot;.

In 1990, the U.S. State Department expressed the view that &quot;The Food and Agriculture Organization has lagged behind other UN organizations in responding to US desires for improvements in program and budget processes to enhance value for money spent&quot;.

A year later, in 1991, &quot;The Ecologist&quot; magazine produced a special issue under the heading &quot;The UN Food and Agriculture Organization: Promoting World Hunger&quot;. The magazine included articles that questioned FAO&#x27;s policies and practices in forestry, fisheries, aquaculture, and pest control. The articles were written by experts such as Helena Norberg-Hodge, Vandana Shiva, Edward Goldsmith, Miguel A. Altieri and Barbara Dinham.

=== 2000s ===
The 2002 Food Summit organized by FAO was considered to have been ineffectual and unproductive by the official participants. Social movements, farmers, fisherfolk, pastoralists, indigenous peoples, environmentalists, women&#x27;s organizations, trade unions and NGOs expressed their &quot;collective disappointment in, and rejection of the official Declaration of the ... Summit&quot;.

In 2004, FAO produced a controversial report called &quot;Agricultural Biotechnology: meeting the needs of the poor?&quot;, which claimed that &quot;agricultural biotechnology has real potential as a new tool in the war on hunger&quot;. In response to the report, more than 650 organizations from around the world signed an open letter in which they said &quot;FAO has broken its commitment to civil society and peasants&#x27; organisations&quot;. The letter complained that organizations representing the interests of farmers had not been consulted, that FAO was siding with the biotechnology industry and, consequently, that the report &quot;raises serious questions about the independence and intellectual integrity of an important United Nations agency&quot;. Jacques Diouf, the Director General of FAO at that time, responded immediately, stating that decisions on biotechnology must &quot;be taken at the international level by competent bodies&quot; (in other words, not by non-governmental organizations). He acknowledged, however, that &quot;biotechnology research is essentially driven by the world&#x27;s top ten transnational corporations&quot; and &quot;the private sector protects its results with patents in order to earn from its investment and it concentrates on products that have no relevance to food in developing countries&quot;.

In May 2006, a British newspaper published the resignation letter of Louise Fresco, one of eight Assistant Directors-General of FAO. In her letter, Fresco stated that &quot;the Organization has been unable to adapt to a new era&quot;, that its &quot;contribution and reputation have declined steadily&quot; and &quot;its leadership has not proposed bold options to overcome this crisis&quot;.

The 32nd Session of FAO&#x27;s Committee on World Food Security in 2006, attended by 120 countries, was widely criticized by non-governmental organizations, but largely ignored by the mainstream media. Oxfam called for an end to the talk-fests while Via Campesina issued a statement that criticised FAO&#x27;s policy of Food Security.

On 18 October 2007, the final report of an Independent External Evaluation of FAO was published. More than 400 pages in length, the evaluation was the first of its kind in the history of the Organization. It had been commissioned by decision of the 33rd Session of the FAO Conference in November 2005. The report concluded that &quot;The Organization is today in a financial and programme crisis&quot; but &quot;the problems affecting the Organization today can all be solved&quot;. Among the problems noted by the IEE were: &quot;The Organization has been conservative and slow to adapt&quot;; &quot;FAO currently has a heavy and costly bureaucracy&quot;, and &quot;The capacity of the Organization is declining and many of its core competencies are now imperilled&quot;. Among the solutions offered were: &quot;A new Strategic Framework&quot;, &quot;institutional culture change and reform of administrative and management systems&quot;. In conclusion the IEE stated that, &quot;If FAO did not exist it would need to be invented&quot;.

The official response from FAO came on 29 October 2007. It indicated that management supported the principal conclusion in the report of the IEE on the need for &quot;reform with growth&quot; so as to have an FAO &quot;fit for this century&quot;. Meanwhile, hundreds of FAO staff signed a petition in support of the IEE recommendations, calling for &quot;a radical shift in management culture and spirit, depoliticization of appointments, restoration of trust between staff and management, [and] setting strategic priorities of the organization&quot;.

In May 2008, while talking about the ongoing world food crisis, President Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal expressed the opinion that FAO was &quot;a waste of money&quot; and that &quot;we must scrap it&quot;. Wade said that FAO was itself largely to blame for the price rises, and that the organization&#x27;s work was duplicated by other bodies that operated more efficiently, like the UN&#x27;s International Fund for Agricultural Development. However, this criticism may have had more to do with personal animosity between the President and the Director-General, himself a Senegalese, particularly in light of the significant differences in the work carried out by the two organizations.

In June 2008, the FAO sponsored the High-Level Conference on World Food Security. The summit was notable for the lack of agreement over the issue of biofuels. The response to the summit among non-governmental organizations was mixed, with Oxfam stating that &quot;the summit in Rome was an important first step in tackling the food crisis but greater action is now needed&quot;, while Maryam Rahmanian of Iran&#x27;s Centre for Sustainable Development said &quot;We are dismayed and disgusted to see the food crisis used to further the policies that have led us to the food crisis in the first place&quot;. As with previous food summits, civil society organizations held a parallel meeting and issued their own declaration to &quot;reject the corporate industrial and energy-intensive model of production and consumption that is the basis of continuing crises.&quot;

In November 2008, a Special Conference of FAO member countries agreed a US$42.6 million (€38.6 million), three-year Immediate Plan of Action for &quot;reform with growth&quot;, as recommended by the IEE. Under the plan US$21.8 million would be spent on overhauling the financial procedures, hierarchies and human resources management.

=== 2010s ===
From 2013, an English-language newspaper based in Rome, &quot;The Italian Insider&quot;, made several allegations of nepotism and corruption within FAO and reported on poor management-staff relations. In June 2018, FAO and four of its officials took the paper and its editor, John Philips, to court alleging defamation, using a law dating back to the fascist era in Italy. Reporters Without Borders condemned &quot;the disproportionate nature of the defamation proceedings&quot;, for which the newspaper was liable for a fine of up to Euros 100,000 and the editor at least three years in prison. The case was adjourned until January 2019, when it was further adjourned until May 2019. The January hearing was considered by the British satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; to have been &quot;one of the more surreal courtroom scenes in modern times&quot;, involving dispute as to the meaning of an English slang word used by the &quot;Insider&quot;.

In 2016/17 FAO was heavily criticized for recruiting Nadine Heredia Alarcón de Humala, wife of the former president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, to a senior position, at a time when she was being investigated by Peru following corruption allegations. Critics included Transparency International.

At the end of April 2017, FAO staff unions addressed the organization&#x27;s Governing Council to complain about the practice of issuing short-term contracts that &quot;exploit employees without providing job security, social security and paid leave&quot;. Other complaints included the increasing centralization of management processes, despite claims that FAO was being decentralized, and the failure to follow United Nations recommendations regarding increasing the retirement age. The staff representative also complained about the high percentage of unfilled positions, increasing the workload for others who were under pressure to deliver more with less. She also noted that contacts between Management and the staff bodies were becoming less and less frequent.

=== 2020s ===
An investigation by the German public broadcaster ARD shows that the Chinese leadership of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation FAO has tailored it to Chinese interests since Qu Dongyu took office in 2019. According to the report, the acting director-general has instrumentalized the FAO in Beijing&#x27;s interests: It is about deliveries of pesticides banned in Europe, the majority of which come from the Chinese agrochemical company Syngenta, UN projects in line with China&#x27;s &quot;Belt and Road Initiative&quot; as well as questionable investment projects.

== FAO renewal ==
The FAO Conference in November 2007 unanimously welcomed the IEE report and established a Conference Committee for the Follow-up to the Independent External Evaluation of FAO (CoC-IEE) to be chaired by the Independent Chairperson of Council, and open to full participation by all Members. The CoC-IEE was charged to review the IEE report and its recommendations and develop an Immediate Plan of Action (IPA) for their implementation.

A comprehensive programme of organizational reform and culture change began in 2008 after the release of an Independent External Evaluation. Headquarters restructuring and delegation of decision making created a flatter more responsive structure and reduced costs. Modernizing and streamlining of administrative and operational processes took place. Improved internal teamwork and closer external partnerships coupled with upgrading of IT infrastructure and greater autonomy of FAO&#x27;s decentralized offices now allows the Organization to respond quickly where needs are greatest. As FAO is primarily a knowledge based organization, investing in human resources is a top priority. Capacity building including a leadership programme, employee rotation and a new junior professional programme were established. Individual performance management, an ethics and ombudsman officer and an independent office of evaluation were designed to improve performance through learning and strengthened oversight.

In January 2012, the Director-General José Graziano da Silva acted upon the commitment made during his campaign to bring the FAO reform to a successful and anticipated completion. In addition, the new Director-General shifted the focus of the reform process to realization of its benefits and mainstreaming the reform into the work of the Organization.

In July 2020, the FAO Council approved a series of measures proposed by its Director-General Qu Dongyu to modernize the organisation and make it more efficient and effective. An important element within the approved measures is the adoption &quot;of a more flexible organizational structure, aimed at ensuring agility, optimal cross-sectoral collaboration and better responses to emerging needs and priorities&quot;.

<doc id="11109" wikidata="Q352465" url="?curid=11109" title="Félix Guattari">
<text>Pierre-Félix Guattari ( ; ; 30 March 1930 – 29 August 1992) was a French psychoanalyst, political philosopher, semiotician, social activist, and screenwriter. He co-founded schizoanalysis with Gilles Deleuze, and created ecosophy independently of Arne Næss, and is best known for his literary and philosophical collaborations with Deleuze, most notably &quot;Anti-Oedipus&quot; (1972) and &quot;A Thousand Plateaus&quot; (1980), the two volumes of their theoretical work &quot;Capitalism and Schizophrenia&quot;.

==Biography==

===Clinic of La Borde===
Guattari was born in Villeneuve-les-Sablons, a working-class suburb of northwest Paris, France. His father was a factory manager and he was engaged in Trotskyist political activism as a teenager, before studying and training under (and being analyzed by) the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan in the early 1950s. Subsequently, he worked all his life at the experimental psychiatric clinic of La Borde under the direction of Lacan&#x27;s pupil, the psychiatrist Jean Oury. He first met Oury at a private psychiatric clinic in Saumery in the Loire region at the suggestion of Oury&#x27;s brother Fernand, who had been Guattari&#x27;s high school teacher. Guattari followed Oury to La Borde in 1955, two years after it had been established. La Borde was a venue for conversation among many students of philosophy, psychology, ethnology, and social work.

One particularly novel orientation developed at La Borde consisted of the suspension of the classical analyst/analysand pair in favour of an open confrontation in group therapy. In contrast to the Freudian school&#x27;s individualistic style of analysis, this practice studied the dynamics of several subjects in complex interaction. It led Guattari into a broader philosophical exploration of, and political engagement with, a vast array of intellectual and cultural domains (philosophy, ethnology, linguistics, architecture, etc.).

===1960s–1970s===
From 1955 to 1965 Guattari edited and contributed to &quot;La Voie Communiste&quot; (&quot;Communist Way&quot;), a Trotskyist newspaper. He supported anti-colonialist struggles as well as the Italian Autonomists. Guattari also took part in the G.T.P.S.I., which gathered many psychiatrists at the beginning of the 1960s and created the Association of Institutional Psychotherapy in November 1965. It was at the same time that he founded, along with other militants, the F.G.E.R.I. (Federation of Groups for Institutional Study &amp; Research) and its review &quot;Recherche&quot; (&quot;Research&quot;), working on philosophy, psychoanalysis, ethnology, education, mathematics, architecture, etc. The F.G.E.R.I. came to represent aspects of the multiple political and cultural engagements of Guattari: the Group for Young Hispanics, the Franco-Chinese Friendships (in the times of the people&#x27;s communes), the opposition activities with the wars in Algeria and Vietnam, the participation in the M.N.E.F., with the U.N.E.F., the policy of the offices of psychological academic aid (B.A.P.U.), the organization of the University Working Groups (G.T.U.), but also the reorganizations of the training courses with the Centers of Training to the Methods of Education Activities (C.E.M.E.A.) for psychiatric male nurses, as well as the formation of a Fellowship of Nurses (Amicales d&#x27;infirmiers) (in 1958), the studies on architecture and the projects of construction of a day hospital for &quot;students and young workers&quot;.

In 1967 he appeared as one of the founders of OSARLA (Organization of solidarity and Aid to the Latin-American Revolution). In 1968, Guattari met Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Jean-Jacques Lebel, and Julian Beck. He was involved in the large-scale French protests of May 1968, starting from the Movement of 22 March. It was in the aftermath of 1968 that Guattari met Gilles Deleuze at the University of Vincennes. Then he began to lay the groundwork for &quot;Anti-Oedipus&quot; (1972), which Michel Foucault described as &quot;an introduction to the non-fascist life&quot; in his preface to the book. In 1970, he created ), which developed the approach explored in the &quot;Recherches&quot; journal. In 1973, Guattari was tried and fined for committing an &quot;outrage to public decency&quot; for publishing an issue of &quot;Recherches&quot; on homosexuality. In 1977, he created the CINEL for &quot;new spaces of freedom&quot; before joining the environmental movement with his &quot;ecosophy&quot; in the 1980s.

===1980s to 1990s===

Guattari viewed the primary commodity produced under capitalism as subjectivity itself. According to Guattari, producing consuming subjects with novel desires satisfiable through continuing purchase of commodities and experiences is the precondition to creating a consumer society.

In his last book, &quot;Chaosmosis&quot; (1992), Guattari returned to the question of subjectivity: &quot;How to produce it, collect it, enrich it, reinvent it permanently in order to make it compatible with mutant Universes of value?&quot; This concern runs through all of his works, from &quot;Psychoanalysis and Transversality&quot; (a collection of articles from 1957 to 1972), through &quot;Years of Winter&quot; (1980–1986) and &quot;Schizoanalytic Cartographies&quot; (1989), to his collaboration with Deleuze, &quot;What is Philosophy?&quot; (1991). In &quot;Chaosmosis&quot;, Guattari proposes an analysis of subjectivity in terms of four functors: (1) material, energetic, and semiotic fluxes; (2) concrete and abstract machinic phyla; (3) virtual universes of value; and (4) finite existential territories. This scheme attempts to grasp the heterogeneity of components involved in the production of subjectivity, as Guattari understands it, which include both signifying semiotic components as well as &quot;a-signifying semiological dimensions&quot; (which work &quot;in parallel or independently of&quot; any signifying function that they may have).

=== Death and posthumous publications ===
On 29 August 1992, two weeks after an interview for the Greek television curated by Yiorgos Veltsos, Guattari died in La Borde from a heart attack.

In 1995, the posthumous release of Guattari&#x27;s &quot;Chaosophy&quot; published essays and interviews concerning Guattari&#x27;s work as director of the experimental La Borde clinic and his collaborations with Deleuze. The collection includes essays such as &quot;Balance-Sheet Program for Desiring Machines,&quot; cosigned by Deleuze (with whom he had coauthored &quot;Anti-Oedipus&quot; and &quot;A Thousand Plateaus&quot;), and &quot;Everybody Wants To Be a Fascist.&quot; It provides an introduction to Guattari&#x27;s theories on &quot;schizoanalysis&quot;, a process that develops Sigmund Freud&#x27;s psychoanalysis but which pursues a more experimental and collective approach towards analysis.

In 1996, another collection of Guattari&#x27;s essays, lectures, and interviews, &quot;Soft Subversions&quot;, was published, which traces the development of his thought and activity throughout the 1980s (&quot;the winter years&quot;). His analyses of art, cinema, youth culture, economics, and power formations, develop concepts such as &quot;micropolitics,&quot; &quot;schizoanalysis,&quot; and &quot;becoming-woman,&quot; which aim to liberate subjectivity and open up new horizons for political and creative resistance to the standardizing and homogenizing processes of global capitalism (which he calls &quot;Integrated World Capitalism&quot;) in the &quot;post-media era.&quot; For example, he used the term &quot;micropolitics&quot; to delimit a certain level of observation of social practices (the unconscious economy, where there is a certain flexibility in the expression of desire and institution) and, practically, to define, in a segregated world, the field of intervention of &quot;people who work to interest themselves in the discourse of the other.&quot;

<doc id="11110" wikidata="Q204085" url="?curid=11110" title="Filioque">
<text> ( ; ), a Latin term meaning &quot;and from the Son&quot;, was added to the original Nicene Creed, and has been the subject of great controversy between Eastern and Western Christianity. The term refers to the Son, Jesus Christ, with the Father, as the one shared origin of the Holy Spirit. It is not in the original text of the Creed, attributed to the First Council of Constantinople (381), which says that the Holy Spirit proceeds &quot;from the Father&quot; () without the addition &quot;and the Son&quot;.

In the late 6th century, some Latin Churches added the words &quot;and from the Son&quot; () to the description of the procession of the Holy Spirit, in what many Eastern Orthodox Christians have at a later stage argued is a violation of Canon VII of the Council of Ephesus, since the words were not included in the text by either the First Council of Nicaea or that of Constantinople. The inclusion was incorporated into the liturgical practice of Rome in 1014, but was rejected by Eastern Christianity.

Whether that term is included, as well as how it is translated and understood, can have major implications for how one understands the doctrine of the Trinity, which is central to the majority of Christian churches. For some, the term implies a serious underestimation of God the Father&#x27;s role in the Trinity; for others, its denial implies a serious underestimation of the role of God the Son in the Trinity.

The term has been an ongoing source of difference between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, formally divided since the East–West Schism of 1054. There have been attempts at resolving the conflict. Among the earlier works that have been used in support of the compatibility of Filioque with Orthodox dogmatic teachings are the works of Maximus the Confessor in early 7th century, canonized independently by both Eastern and Western churches. Differences over this and other doctrines, and mainly the question of the disputed papal primacy, have been and remain the primary causes of the schism between the Eastern Orthodox and Western churches.

==Nicene Creed==
The Nicene Creed as amended by the Second Ecumenical Council held in Constantinople in 381 includes the section:

The controversy arises from the insertion of the word (&quot;and the Son&quot;) in the line:

==Controversy==
The controversy referring to the term involves four separate disagreements:
* Controversy about the term itself
* Controversy about the orthodoxy of the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son, to which the term refers
* Controversy about the legitimacy of inserting the term into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed
* Controversy about the authority of the Pope to define the orthodoxy of the doctrine or to insert the term into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed.

Although the disagreement about the doctrine preceded the disagreement about the insertion into the Creed, the two disagreements became linked to the third when the pope approved insertion of the term into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, in the 11th century. Anthony Siecienski writes that &quot;Ultimately what was at stake was not only God&#x27;s trinitarian nature, but also the nature of the Church, its teaching authority and the distribution of power among its leaders.&quot;

Hubert Cunliffe-Jones identifies two opposing Eastern Orthodox opinions about the &quot;Filioque&quot;, a &quot;liberal&quot; view and a &quot;rigorist&quot; view. The &quot;liberal&quot; view sees the controversy as being largely a matter of mutual miscommunication and misunderstanding. In this view, both East and West are at fault for failing to allow for a &quot;plurality of theologies&quot;. Each side went astray in considering its theological framework as the only one that was doctrinally valid and applicable. Thus, neither side would accept that the dispute was not so much about conflicting dogmas as it was about different &quot;theologoumena&quot; or theological perspectives. While all Christians must be in agreement on questions of dogma, there is room for diversity in theological approaches.

This view is vehemently opposed by those in Eastern Orthodox Church whom Cunliffe-Jones identifies as holding a &quot;rigorist&quot; view. According to the standard Eastern Orthodox position, as pronounced by Photius, Mark of Ephesus and 20th century Eastern Orthodox theologians such as Vladimir Lossky, the &quot;Filioque&quot; question hinges on fundamental issues of dogma and cannot be dismissed as simply one of different &quot;theologoumena&quot;. Many in the &quot;rigorist&quot; camp consider the &quot;Filioque&quot; to have resulted in the role of the Holy Spirit being underestimated by the Western Church and thus leading to serious doctrinal error.

In a similar vein, Siecienski comments that, although it was common in the 20th century to view the &quot;Filioque&quot; as just another weapon in the power struggle between Rome and Constantinople and although this was occasionally the case, for many involved in the dispute, the theological issues outweighed by far the ecclesiological concerns. According to Siecienski, the deeper question was perhaps whether Eastern and Western Christianity had wound up developing &quot;differing and ultimately incompatible teachings about the nature of God&quot;. Moreover, Siecienski asserts that the question of whether the teachings of East and West were truly incompatible became almost secondary to the fact that, starting around the 8th or 9th century, Christians on both sides of the dispute began to believe that the differences &quot;were&quot; irreconcilable.

From the view of the West, the Eastern rejection of the &quot;Filioque&quot; denied the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son and was thus a form of crypto-Arianism. In the East, the interpolation of the &quot;Filioque&quot; seemed to many to be an indication that the West was teaching a &quot;substantially different faith&quot;. Siecienski asserts that, as much as power and authority were central issues in the debate, the strength of emotion rising even to the level of hatred can be ascribed to a belief that the other side had &quot;destroyed the purity of the faith and refused to accept the clear teachings of the fathers on the Spirit&#x27;s procession&quot;.

==History==
===New Testament===
It is argued that in the relations between the persons of the Trinity, one person cannot &quot;take&quot; or &quot;receive&quot; () anything from either of the others except by way of procession. Biblical texts such as John 20:22 were seen by Fathers of the Church, especially Athanasius of Alexandria, Cyril of Alexandria and Epiphanius of Salamis, as grounds for saying that the Spirit &quot;proceeds substantially from both&quot; the Father and the Son. Other texts that have been used include Galatians 4:6, Romans 8:9, Philippians 1:19, where the Holy Spirit is called &quot;the Spirit of the Son&quot;, &quot;the Spirit of Christ&quot;, &quot;the Spirit of Jesus Christ&quot;, texts in the Gospel of John on the sending of the Holy Spirit by Jesus, and John 16:7. Revelation 22:1 states that the river of the Water of Life in Heaven is &quot;flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb&quot;, which may be interpreted as the Holy Spirit proceeding from both the Father and the Son. Tension can be seen in comparing these two passages:
* John 14:26 NASB – [26] &quot;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.&quot;
* John 15:26 NASB – [26] &quot;When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, [that is] the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify about Me&quot;

Siecienski asserts that &quot;the New Testament does not explicitly address the procession of the Holy Spirit as later theology would understand the doctrine&quot;, although there are &quot;certain principles established in the New Testament that shaped later Trinitarian theology, and particular texts that both Latins and Greeks exploited to support their respective positions vis-à-vis the &quot;. In contrast, Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen says that Eastern Orthodox believe that the absence of an explicit mention of the double procession of the Holy Spirit is a strong indication that the is a theologically erroneous doctrine.

===Church Fathers===

====Cappadocian Fathers====

Basil of Caesarea wrote: &quot;Through the one Son [the Holy Spirit] is joined to the Father&quot;. He also said that the &quot;natural goodness, inherent holiness, and royal dignity reaches from the Father through the only-begotten () to the Spirit&quot;. However, Siecienski comments that &quot;there are passages in Basil that are certainly capable of being read as advocating something like the , but to do so would be to misunderstand the inherently soteriological thrust of his work&quot;.

Gregory of Nazianzus distinguished the coming forth () of the Spirit from the Father from that of the Son from the Father by saying that the latter is by generation, but that of the Spirit by procession (), a matter on which there is no dispute between East and West, as shown also by the Latin Father Augustine of Hippo, who wrote that although biblical exegetes had not adequately discussed the individuality of the Holy Spirit:

Gregory of Nyssa stated:

Cyril of Alexandria provides &quot;a host of quotations that seemingly speak of the Spirit&#x27;s &#x27;procession&#x27; from both the Father and the Son&quot;. In these passages he uses the Greek verbs (like the Latin ) and (flow from), not the verb , the verb that appears in the Greek text of the Nicene Creed.

Epiphanius of Salamis is stated by Bulgakov to present in his writings &quot;a whole series of expressions to the effect that the Holy Spirit is from the Father and the Son, out of the Father and the Son, from the Father and out of the Son, from Both, from one and the same essence as the Father and the Son, and so on&quot;. Bulgakov concludes: &quot;The patristic teaching of the fourth century lacks that exclusivity which came to characterize Orthodox theology after Photius under the influence of repulsion from the Filioque doctrine. Although we do not here find the pure that Catholic theologians find, we also do not find that opposition to the that became something of an Orthodox or, rather, anti-Catholic dogma.&quot;

Regarding the Greek Fathers, whether Cappadocian or Alexandrian, there is, according to Siecienski, no citable basis for the claim historically made by both sides, that they explicitly either supported or denied the later theologies concerning the procession of the Spirit from the Son. However, they did enunciate important principles later invoked in support of one theology or the other. These included the insistence on the unique hypostatic properties of each Divine Person, in particular the Father&#x27;s property of being, within the Trinity, the one cause, while they also recognized that the Persons, though distinct, cannot be separated, and that not only the sending of the Spirit to creatures but also the Spirit&#x27;s eternal flowing forth () from the Father within the Trinity is &quot;through the Son&quot; ().

==== Latin Fathers ====

Siecienski remarked that, &quot;while the Greek fathers were still striving to find language capable of expressing the mysterious nature of the Son&#x27;s relationship to the Spirit, Latin theologians, even during Cyril&#x27;s lifetime, had already found their answer – the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (). The degree to which this teaching was compatible with, or contradictory to, the emerging Greek tradition remains, sixteen centuries later, subject to debate.&quot;

Before the creed of 381 became known in the West and even before it was adopted by the First Council of Constantinople, Christian writers in the West, of whom Tertullian (), Jerome (347–420), Ambrose () and Augustine (354–430) are representatives, spoke of the Spirit as coming from the Father and the Son, while the expression &quot;from the Father through the Son&quot; is also found among them.

In the early 3rd century Roman province of Africa, Tertullian emphasises that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit all share a single divine substance, quality and power, which he conceives of as flowing forth from the Father and being transmitted by the Son to the Spirit. Using the metaphor the root, the shoot, and the fruit; the spring, the river, and the stream; and the sun, the ray, and point of light for the unity with distinction in the Trinity, he adds, &quot;The Spirit, then, is third from God and the Son, ...&quot;

In his arguments against Arianism, Marius Victorinus () strongly connected the Son and the Spirit.

In the mid-4th century, Hilary of Poitiers wrote of the Spirit &quot;coming forth from the Father&quot; and being &quot;sent by the Son&quot;; as being &quot;from the Father through the Son&quot;; and as &quot;having the Father and the Son as his source&quot;; in another passage, Hilary points to John 16:15 (where Jesus says: &quot;All things that the Father has are mine; therefore I said that [the Spirit] shall take from what is mine and declare it to you&quot;), and wonders aloud whether &quot;to receive from the Son is the same thing as to proceed from the Father&quot;.

In the late 4th century, Ambrose of Milan asserted that the Spirit &quot;proceeds from () the Father and the Son&quot;, without ever being separated from either.
Ambrose adds, &quot;[W]ith You, Almighty God, Your Son is the Fount of Life, that is, the Fount of the Holy Spirit. For the Spirit is life ...&quot;

&quot;None of these writers, however, makes the Spirit&#x27;s mode of origin the object of special reflection; all are concerned, rather, to emphasize the equality of status of all three divine persons as God, and all acknowledge that the Father alone is the source of God&#x27;s eternal being.&quot;

Pope Gregory I, in Gospel Homily 26, notes that the Son is &quot;sent&quot; by the Father both in the sense of an eternal generation and a temporal Incarnation. Thus, the Spirit is said to be &quot;sent&quot; by the Son from the Father both as to an eternal procession and a temporal mission. &quot;The sending of the Spirit is that procession by which It proceeds from the Father and the Son.&quot; In his &quot;Moralia in Iob&quot;, initially composed while he was at the imperial court of Constantinople and later edited while Pope of Rome, Gregory wrote, &quot;But the Mediator of God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, in all things has Him (the Holy Spirit) both always and continually present. For the same Spirit even in substance is brought forth from Him (.) And thus, though He (the Spirit) abides in the holy Preachers, He is justly said to abide in the Mediator in a special manner, for that in them He abides of grace for a particular object, but in Him He abides substantially for all ends.&quot; Later in the &quot;Moralia&quot; (xxx.iv.17), St. Gregory writes of the procession of the Holy Spirit from Father and Son while defending their co-equality. Thus, he wrote, &quot;[The Son] shews both how He springs from the Father not unequal to Himself, and how the Spirit of Both proceeds coeternal with Both. For we shall then openly behold, how That Which Is by an origin, is not subsequent to Him from Whom It springs; how He Who is produced by procession, is not preceded by Those from Whom He proceeded. We shall then behold openly how both The One [God] is divisibly Three [Persons] and the Three [Persons] indivisibly One [God].&quot;

Later in his &quot;Dialogues&quot;, Gregory I took the doctrine for granted when he quoted John 16:7, and asked: if &quot;it is certain that the Paraclete Spirit always proceeds from the Father and the Son, why does the Son say that He is about to leave so that [the Spirit] who never leaves the Son might come?&quot; The text proposes an eternal procession from both Father and the Son by the use of the word &quot;always&quot; (). Gregory I&#x27;s use of and is also significant for the divine procession because although the Spirit always proceeds () from the Father and the Son, the Spirit never leaves () the Son by this eternal procession.

====Modern Catholic theologians====
Yves Congar commented, &quot;The walls of separation do not reach as high as heaven.&quot; And Aidan Nichols remarked that &quot;the controversy is, in fact, a casualty of the theological pluralism of the patristic Church&quot;, on the one hand the Latin and Alexandrian tradition, on the other the Cappadocian and later Byzantine tradition.

=== Nicene and Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creeds ===

The original Nicene Creed – composed in Greek and adopted by the first ecumenical council, Nicaea I (325) – ended with the words &quot;and in the Holy Spirit&quot; without defining the procession of the Holy Spirit. The procession of the Holy Spirit was defined in what is also called the Nicene Creed, or more accurately the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, which was also composed in Greek.

Traditionally, the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed is attributed to the First Council of Constantinople of 381, whose participants, primarily Eastern bishops, met, decided issues (legates of Pope Damasus I were present).

The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed is not documented earlier than the Council of Chalcedon (451), which referred to it as &quot;the creed [...] of the 150 saintly fathers assembled in Constantinople&quot; in its acts. It was cited at Chalcedon I on instructions from the representative of the Emperor who chaired the meeting and who may have wished to present it as &quot;a precedent for drawing up new creeds and definitions to supplement the Creed of Nicaea, as a way of getting round the ban on new creeds in&quot; Ephesus I canon 7. The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed was recognized and received by Leo I at Chalcedon I. Scholars do not agree on the connection between Constantinople I and the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, which was not simply an expansion of the Creed of Nicaea, and was probably based on another traditional creed independent of the one from Nicaea.

The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed is roughly equivalent to the Nicene Creed plus two additional articles: one on the Holy Spirit and another about the Church, baptism, and resurrection of the dead. For the full text of both creeds, see Comparison between Creed of 325 and Creed of 381.

The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed article professes:
It speaks of the Holy Spirit &quot;proceeding from the Father&quot; – a phrase based on John 15:26.

The Greek word () refers to the ultimate source from which the proceeding occurs, but the Latin verb (and the corresponding terms used to translate it into other languages) can apply also to proceeding through a mediate channel. Frederick Bauerschmidt notes that what Medieval theologians disregarded as minor objections about ambiguous terms, was in fact an &quot;insufficient understanding of the semantic difference&quot; between the Greek and Latin terms in both the East and the West. The West used the more generic Latin term (to move forward; to come forth) which is more synonymous with the Greek term () than the more specific Greek term (, &quot;to issue forth as from an origin&quot;). The West traditionally used one term and the East traditionally used two terms to convey arguably equivalent and complementary meaning, that is, from the Father and from the Son. Moreover, the more generic Latin term, , does not have &quot;the added implication of the starting-point of that movement; thus it is used to translate a number of other Greek theological terms.&quot; It is used as the Latin equivalent, in the Vulgate, of not only , but also , and (four times) and is used of Jesus&#x27; originating from God in John 8:42, although at that time Greek was already beginning to designate the Holy Spirit&#x27;s manner of originating from the Father as opposed to that of the Son ( — being born).

=== Third Ecumenical Council ===

The third Ecumenical council, Ephesus I (431), quoted the creed in its 325 form, not in that of 381, decreed in Ephesus I canon 7 that:

Ephesus I canon 7 was cited at the Second Council of Ephesus (449) and at the Council of Chalcedon (451), and was echoed in the Chalcedon definition. This account in the 2005 publication concerning the citing by Eutyches of Ephesus I canon 7 in his defence was confirmed by Stephen H. Webb in his 2011 book &quot;Jesus Christ, Eternal God&quot;.

Ephesus I canon 7, against additions to the Creed of Nicaea, is used as a polemic against the addition of to the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, In any case, while Ephesus I canon 7 forbade setting up a different creed as a rival to that of Nicaea I, it was the creed attributed to Constantinople I that was adopted liturgically in the East and later a Latin variant was adopted in the West. The form of this creed that the West adopted had two additions: &quot;God from God&quot; () and &quot;and the Son&quot; (). Strictly speaking, Ephesus I canon 7 applies &quot;only to the formula to be used in the reception of converts.&quot;

Philippe Labbe remarked that Ephesus I canons 7 and 8 are omitted in some collections of canons and that the collection of Dionysius Exiguus omitted all the Ephesus I canons, apparently considered that they did not concern the Church as a whole.

=== Fourth Ecumenical Council ===

At the fourth ecumenical council, Chalcedon I (451), both the Nicene Creed of 325 and the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, were read, the former at the request of a bishop, the latter, against the protests of the bishops, on the initiative of the emperor&#x27;s representative, &quot;doubtless motivated by the need to find a precedent for drawing up new creeds and definitions to supplement the Creed of Nicaea, as a way of getting round the ban on new creeds in&quot; Ephesus I canon 7. The acts of Chalcedon I defined that:

===Possible earliest use in the Creed===
Some scholars claim that the earliest example of the clause in the East is contained in the West Syriac recension of the profession of faith of the Church of the East formulated at the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in Persia in 410. This council was held some twenty years before the Nestorian Schism that caused the later split between the Church of the East and the Church in the Roman Empire. Since wording of that recension (&quot;who is from the Father and the Son&quot;) does not contain any mention of the term &quot;procession&quot; or any of the other particular terms that would describe relations between Father, Son and the Holy Spirit, the previously mentioned claim for the &quot;earliest use&quot; of clause is not universally accepted by scholars. Furthermore, another recension that is preserved in the East Syriac sources of the Church of the East contains only the phrase &quot;and in the Holy Spirit&quot;.

Various professions of faith confessed the doctrine during the patristic age. The (380 or 5th century), a profession of faith attributed to Pseudo-Damasus or Jerome, includes a formula of the doctrine. The (400), a profession of faith legislated by the Toledo I synod, includes a formula of the doctrine. The Athanasian Creed (5th century), a profession of faith attributed to Pseudo-Athanasius, includes a formula of the doctrine.

The generally accepted first found insertion of the term into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, in Western Christianity, is in acts of the Third Council of Toledo (Toledo III) (589), nearly two centuries later, but it may be a later interpolation.

===Procession of the Holy Spirit===
As early as the 4th century, a distinction was made, in connection with the Trinity, between the two Greek verbs (the verb used in the original Greek text of the 381 Nicene Creed) and . Gregory of Nazianzus wrote: &quot;The Holy Ghost is truly Spirit, coming forth () from the Father indeed, but not after the manner of the Son, for it is not by Generation but by Procession ()&quot;.

That the Holy Spirit &quot;proceeds&quot; from the Father and the Son in the sense of the Latin word and the Greek (as opposed to the Greek ) was taught by the early 5th century by Cyril of Alexandria in the East. The Athanasian Creed, probably composed as early as the mid 5th-century, and a dogmatic epistle of Pope Leo I, who declared in 446 that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son.

Although the Eastern Fathers were aware that the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son was taught in the West, they did not generally regard it as heretical. According to Sergei Bulgakov &quot;a whole series of Western writers, including popes who are venerated as saints by the Eastern church, confess the procession of the Holy Spirit also from the Son; and it is even more striking that there is virtually no disagreement with this theory.&quot; In 447, Leo I taught it in a letter to a Spanish bishop and an anti-Priscillianist council held the same year proclaimed it. The argument was taken a crucial step further in 867 by the affirmation in the East that the Holy Spirit proceeds not merely &quot;from the Father&quot; but &quot;from the Father &quot;.

The was inserted into the Creed as an anti-Arian addition, by the Third Council of Toledo (589), at which King Reccared I and some Arians in his Visigothic Kingdom converted to orthodox, Catholic Christianity. The Toledo XI synod (675) included the doctrine but not the term in its profession of faith.

Other Toledo synods &quot;to affirm Trinitarian consubstantiality&quot; between 589 and 693.

The clause was confirmed by subsequent synods in Toledo and soon spread throughout the West, not only in Spain, but also in Francia, after Clovis I, king of the Salian Franks, converted to Christianity in 496; and in England, where the Council of Hatfield (680), presided over by Archbishop of Canterbury Theodore of Tarsus, a Greek, imposed the doctrine as a response to Monothelitism.

However, while the doctrine was taught in Rome, the term was not professed liturgically in the Creed until 1014.

In the Vulgate the Latin verb , which appears in the passage of the Creed in Latin, is used to translate several Greek verbs. While one of those verbs, , the one in the corresponding phrase in the Creed in Greek, &quot;was beginning to take on a particular meaning in Greek theology designating the Spirit&#x27;s unique mode of coming-to-be [...] had no such connotations&quot;.

Although Hilary of Poitiers is often cited as one of &quot;the chief patristic source(s) for the Latin teaching on the &quot;, Siecienski says that &quot;there is also reason for questioning Hilary&#x27;s support for the as later theology would understand it, especially given the ambiguous nature of (Hilary&#x27;s) language as it concerns the procession.&quot;

However, a number of Latin Church Fathers of the 4th and 5th centuries explicitly speak of the Holy Spirit as proceeding &quot;from the Father and the Son&quot;, the phrase in the present Latin version of the Nicene Creed. Examples are what is called the creed of Pope Damasus I, Ambrose of Milan (&quot;one of the earliest witnesses to the explicit affirmation of the Spirit&#x27;s procession from the Father the Son&quot;), Augustine of Hippo (whose writings on the Trinity &quot;became the foundation of subsequent Latin trinitarian theology and later served as the foundation for the doctrine of the &quot;). and Leo I, who qualified as &quot;impious&quot; those who say &quot;there is not one who begat, another who is begotten, another who proceeded from both []&quot;; he also accepted the Council of Chalcedon, with its reaffirmation of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, in its original &quot;from the Father&quot; form, as much later did his successor Pope Leo III who professed his faith in the teaching expressed by the , while opposing its inclusion in the Creed.

Thereafter, Eucherius of Lyon, Gennadius of Massilia, Boethius, Agnellus, Bishop of Ravenna, Cassiodorus, Gregory of Tours are witnesses that the idea that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son was well established as part of the (Western) Church&#x27;s faith, before Latin theologians began to concern themselves about the Spirit proceeds from the Son.

Pope Gregory I is usually counted as teaching the Spirit&#x27;s procession from the Son, although Byzantine theologians, quoting from Greek translations of his work rather than the original, present him as a witness against it, and although he sometimes speaks of the Holy Spirit as proceeding from the Father without mentioning the Son. Siecienski says that, in view of the widespread acceptance by then that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, it would be strange if Gregory did not advocate the teaching, &quot;even if he did not understand the as later Latin theology would – that is, in terms of a &#x27;double procession&#x27;.&quot;

===&quot;From the Father through the Son&quot;===
Church Fathers also use the phrase &quot;from the Father through the Son&quot;. Cyril of Alexandria, who undeniably several times states that the Holy Spirit issues from the Father the Son, also speaks of the Holy Spirit coming from the Father the Son, two different expressions that for him are complementary: the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father does not exclude the Son&#x27;s mediation and the Son receives from the Father a participation in the Holy Spirit&#x27;s coming. Cyril, in his ninth anathema against Nestorius, had stated that the Spirit was Christ&#x27;s own Spirit, which led Theodoret of Cyrus to question whether Cyril was advocating the idea that &quot;the Spirit has his subsistence from the Son or through the Son&quot;. For Theodoret this idea was both &quot;blasphemous and impious [...] for we believe the Lord who has said: &#x27;the Spirit of Truth who proceeds from the Father...&#x27; &quot;. Cyril denied that he held this teaching, leading Theodoret to confirm the orthodoxy of Cyril&#x27;s trinitarian theology, since the Church had always taught that &quot;the Holy Spirit does not receive existence from or through the Son, but proceeds from the Father and is called the proprium of the Son because of his consubstantiality. The phrase &quot;from the Son or through the Son&quot; continued to be used by Cyril, albeit in light of the clarification. The Roman Catholic Church accepts both phrases, and considers that they do not affect the reality of the same faith and instead express the same truth in slightly different ways. The influence of Augustine of Hippo made the phrase &quot;proceeds from the Father through the Son&quot; popular throughout the West, but, while used also in the East, &quot;through the Son&quot; was later, according to Philip Schaff, dropped or rejected by some as being nearly equivalent to &quot;from the Son&quot; or &quot;and the Son&quot;. Others spoke of the Holy Spirit proceeding &quot;from the Father&quot;, as in the text of the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan Creed, which &quot;did not state that the Spirit proceeds from the Father &quot;.

===First Eastern opposition===

The first recorded objection by a representative of Eastern Christianity against the Western belief that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son occurred when Patriarch Paul II of Constantinople () made accusations against either Pope Theodore I () or Pope Martin I () for using the expression. Theodore I excommunicated Paul II in 647 for Monothelitism. In response to the attack by Paul, Maximus the Confessor, a Greek opponent of Monothelitism, declared that it was wrong to condemn the Roman use of &quot;and the Son&quot; because the Romans &quot;have produced the unanimous evidence of the Latin Fathers, and also of Cyril of Alexandria [...] On the basis of these texts, they have shown that they have not made the Son the cause of the Spirit – they know in fact that the Father is the only cause of the Son and the Spirit, the one by begetting and the other by procession – but that they have manifested the procession through him and have thus shown the unity and identity of the essence.&quot; He also indicated that the differences between the Latin and Greek languages were an obstacle to mutual understanding, since &quot;they cannot reproduce their idea in a language and in words that are foreign to them as they can in their mother-tongue, just as we too cannot do&quot;.

===Claims of authenticity===
At the end of the 8th and the beginning of the 9th century, the Church of Rome was faced with an unusual challenge regarding the use of Filioque clause. Among the Church leaders in Frankish Kingdom of that time a notion was developing that Filioque clause was in fact an authentic part of the original Creed. Trying to deal with that problem and its potentially dangerous consequences, the Church of Rome found itself in the middle of a widening rift between its own Daughter-Church in Frankish Kingdom and Sister-Churches of the East. Popes of that time, Hadrian I and Leo III, had to face various challenges while trying to find solutions that would preserve the unity of the Church.

First signs of the problems were starting to show by the end of the reign of Frankish king Pepin the Short (751–768). Use of the clause in the Frankish Kingdom led to controversy with envoys of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine V at the Synod of Gentilly (767). As the practice of chanting the interpolated Latin at Mass spread in the West, the became a part of Latin liturgy throughout the Frankish Kingdom. The practice of chanting the Creed was adopted in Charlemagne&#x27;s court by the end of the 8th century and spread through all of his realms, including some northern parts of Italy, but not to Rome, where its use was not accepted until 1014.

Serious problems erupted in 787 after the Second Council of Nicaea when Charlemagne accused the Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople of infidelity to the faith of the First Council of Nicaea, allegedly because he had not professed the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father &quot;and the Son&quot;, but only &quot;through the Son&quot;. Pope Adrian I rejected those accusations and tried to explain to the Frankish king that pneumatology of Tarasios was in accordance with the teachings of the holy Fathers. Surprisingly, efforts of the pope had no effect.

The true scale of the problem became evident during the following years. The Frankish view of the was emphasized again in the , composed around 791–793. Openly arguing that the word was part of the Creed of 381, the authors of demonstrated not only the surprising lack of basic knowledge but also the lack of will to receive right advice and counsel from the Mother-Church in Rome. Frankish theologians reaffirmed the notion that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, and rejected as inadequate the teaching that the Spirit proceeds from the Father . That claim was both erroneous and dangerous for the preservation of the unity of the Church.

In those days, another theological problem appeared to be closely connected with the use of in the West. In the late 8th century, a controversy arose between Bishop Elipandus of Toledo and Beatus of Liébana over the former&#x27;s teaching (which has been called Spanish Adoptionism) that Christ in his humanity was the adoptive son of God. Elipandus was supported by Bishop Felix of Urgel. In 785, Pope Hadrian I condemned the teaching of Elipandus. In 791, Felix appealed to Charlemagne in defense of the Spanish Adoptionist teaching, sending him a tract outlining it. He was condemned at the Synod of Regensburg (792) and was sent to Pope Hadrian in Rome, where he made of profession of orthodox faith, but returned to Spain and there reaffirmed Adoptionism. Elipandus wrote to the bishops of the territories controlled by Charlemagne in defence of his teaching, which was condemned at the Council of Frankfurt (794) and at the Synod of Friuli (796). The controversy encouraged those who rejected Adoptionism to introduce into the liturgy the use of the Creed, with the , to profess belief that Christ was the Son from eternity, not adopted as a son at his baptism.

At the Synod of Friuli, Paulinus II of Aquileia stated that the insertion of in the 381 Creed of the First Council of Constantinople was no more a violation of the prohibition of new creeds than were the insertions into the 325 Creed of the First Council of Nicaea that were done by the First Council of Constantinople itself. What was forbidden, he said, was adding or removing something &quot;craftily [...] contrary to the sacred intentions of the fathers&quot;, not a council&#x27;s addition that could be shown to be in line with the intentions of the Fathers and the faith of the ancient Church. Actions such as that of the First Council of Contantinople were sometimes called for in order to clarify the faith and do away with heresies that appear. The views of Paulinus show that some advocates of Filioque clause were quite aware of the fact that it actually was not part of the Creed.

Political events that followed additionally complicated the issue. According to John Meyendorff, and John Romanides the Frankish efforts to get new Pope Leo III to approve the addition of to the Creed were due to a desire of Charlemagne, who in 800 had been crowned in Rome as Emperor, to find grounds for accusations of heresy against the East. The Pope&#x27;s refusal to approve the interpolation of the into the Creed avoided arousing a conflict between East and West about this matter. During his reign (), and for another two centuries, there was no Creed at all in the Roman rite Mass.

Reasons for the continuing refusal of the Frankish Church to adopt the positions of the Church of Rome on necessity of leaving Filioque outside of Creed remained unknown. In 808 or 809 apparent controversy arose in Jerusalem between the Greek monks of one monastery and the Frankish Benedictine monks of another: the Greeks reproached the latter for, among other things, singing the creed with the included. In response, the theology of the was expressed in the 809 local Council of Aachen (809).

Faced with another endorsement of the Filioque, pope Leo III denied his approval and publicly posted the Creed in Rome without the Filioque, written in Greek and Latin on two silver plaques, in defense of the Orthodox Faith (810) stating his opposition to the addition of the into the Creed. Although Leo III did not disapprove the doctrine, the Pope strongly believed the clause should not be included into the Creed. In spite of the efforts of the Church of Rome, the acceptance of the Filioque clause in the Creed of the Frankish Church proved to be irreversible.

===Photian controversy===
Around 860 the controversy over the broke out in the course of the disputes between Patriarch Photius of Constantinople and Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople. Pope Nicholas I contended that Patriarch Ignatios of Constantinople was deposed in 858 and Photius I raised to the patriarchal see in violation of ecclesiastical law and at a Roman synod held in April 863, he excommunicated Photius. In 867 Photius was Patriarch of Constantinople and issued an &quot;Encyclical to the Eastern Patriarchs&quot;, and called a council in Constantinople in which he charged the Western Church with heresy and schism because of differences in practices, in particular for the and the authority of the Papacy. The situation had escalated from issues of jurisdiction and custom to include matters of dogma. This council declared Pope Nicholas anathema, excommunicated and deposed.

Photius excluded not only &quot;and the Son&quot; but also &quot;through the Son&quot; with regard to the eternal procession of the Holy Spirit: for him &quot;through the Son&quot; applied only to the temporal mission of the Holy Spirit (the sending in time). He maintained that the eternal procession of the Holy Spirit is &quot;from the Father &quot;. This phrase was verbally a novelty, however, Eastern Orthodox theologians generally hold that in substance the phrase is only a reaffirmation of traditional teaching. Sergei Bulgakov, on the other hand, declared that Photius&#x27;s doctrine itself &quot;represents a sort of novelty for the Eastern church&quot;. Bulgakov writes: &quot;The Cappadocians expressed only one idea: the monarchy of the Father and, consequently, the procession of the Holy Spirit precisely from the Father. They never imparted to this idea, however, the exclusiveness that it acquired in the epoch of the Filioque disputes after Photius, in the sense of (from the Father alone)&quot;; Nichols summarized that, &quot;Bulgakov finds it amazing that with all his erudition Photius did not see that the &#x27;through the Spirit&#x27; of Damascene and others constituted a different theology from his own, just as it is almost incomprehensible to find him trying to range the Western Fathers and popes on his Monopatrist side.&quot;

Photius&#x27;s importance endured in regard to relations between East and West. He is recognized as a saint by the Eastern Orthodox Church and his line of criticism has often been echoed later, making reconciliation between East and West difficult.

At least three councils – Council of Constantinople (867), Fourth Council of Constantinople (Roman Catholic) (869), and Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox) (879) – were held in Constantinople over the actions of Emperor Michael III in deposing Ignatius and replacing him with Photius. The Council of Constantinople (867) was convened by Photius to address the question of Papal Supremacy over all of the churches and their patriarchs and the use of the .

The council of 867 was followed by the Fourth Council of Constantinople (Roman Catholic), in 869, which reversed the previous council and was promulgated by Rome. The Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox), in 879, restored Photius to his see. It was attended by Western legates Cardinal Peter of St Chrysogonus, Paul Bishop of Ancona and Eugene Bishop of Ostia who approved its canons, but it is unclear whether it was ever promulgated by Rome.

===Adoption in Latin liturgies===

Latin liturgical use of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed with the added term spread between the 8th and 11th centuries.

Only in 1014, at the request of King Henry II of Germany (who was in Rome for his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor and was surprised by the different custom in force there) did Pope Benedict VIII, who owed to Henry II his restoration to the papal throne after usurpation by Antipope Gregory VI, have the Creed with the addition of , sung at Mass in Rome for the first time. In some other places was incorporated in the Creed even later: in parts of southern Italy after the Council of Bari in 1098 and at Paris seemingly not even by 1240, 34 years before the Second Council of Lyon defined that the Holy Spirit &quot;proceeds eternally from the Father and from the Son, not as from two principles but from a single principle, not by two spirations but by a single spiration&quot;.

Since then the phrase has been included in the Creed throughout the Latin Church except where Greek is used in the liturgy.

Its adoption among the Eastern Catholic Churches (formerly known as Uniate churches) has been discouraged.

===East–West controversy===

Eastern opposition to the strengthened after the 11th century East–West Schism. According to the synodal edict, a Latin anathema, in the excommunication of 1054, against the Greeks included: &quot;&quot; (&quot;as pneumatomachi and theomachi, they have cut from the Creed the procession of the holy Spirit from the Son&quot;). The Council of Constantinople, in a synodal edict, responded with anathemas against the Latins:&quot; (&quot;And besides all this, and quite unwilling to see that it is they claim that the Spirit proceeds from the Father, not [only], but also from the Son – as if they have no evidence of the evangelists of this, and if they do not have the dogma of the ecumenical council regarding this slander. For the Lord our God says, &quot;even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father (John 15:26)&quot;. But parents say this new wickedness of the Spirit, who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&quot;)

Two councils that were held to heal the break discussed the question.

The Second Council of Lyon (1274) accepted the profession of faith of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos: &quot;We believe also the Holy Spirit, fully, perfectly and truly God, proceeding from the Father and the Son, fully equal, of the same substance, equally almighty and equally eternal with the Father and the Son in all things.&quot; and the Greek participants, including Patriarch Joseph I of Constantinople sang the Creed three times with the clause. Most Byzantine Christians feeling disgust and recovering from the Latin Crusaders&#x27; conquest and betrayal, refused to accept the agreement made at Lyon with the Latins. Michael VIII was excommunicated by Pope Martin IV in November 1281, and later died, after which Patriarch Joseph I&#x27;s successor, Patriarch John XI of Constantinople, who had become convinced that the teaching of the Greek Fathers was compatible with that of the Latins, was forced to resign, and was replaced by Patriarch Gregory II of Constantinople, who was strongly of the opposite opinion.

Lyons II did not require those Christians to change the recitation of the creed in their liturgy.

Lyons II stated &quot;that the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son, not as from two principles, but one, not from two spirations but by only one,&quot; is &quot;the unchangeable and true doctrine of the orthodox Fathers and Doctors, both Latin and Greek.&quot; So, it &quot;condemn and disapprove those who deny that the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from Father and Son or who assert that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son as from two principles, not from one.&quot;

The local Orthodox Council of Constantinople (1285) was called in response to Lyons II and repudiated the union of the Churches, condemning the pro-Unionist patriarch John XI Beccus, and giving a more explicit condemnation of the &quot;Filioque&quot; than any earlier councils. It specifically condemned:

* that the Father is, through the Son, the essential cause of the Spirit.
* that the Spirit exists through the Son and from the Son.
* that the preposition “through” is equivalent to “from.”
* that the one unique essence and divinity of the Father and the Son is the cause of the Spirit.
* that the Father and the Son together constitute a single cause in the procession of the Spirit.
* that the procession of the Spirit from the Father is an activity of the essence, not of the hypostasis.
* that the expression “through the Son,” when used in reference to the creation of the world, indicates that the Son is the primordial or initial cause.
* that the Son is the “fountain of life” or the cause of life in the procession of the Spirit, just as the Virgin is said to be the fountain of life in giving birth to Christ.
Another attempt at reunion was made at the 15th century Council of Florence, to which Emperor John VIII Palaiologos, Ecumenical Patriarch Joseph II of Constantinople, and other bishops from the East had gone in the hope of getting Western military aid against the looming Ottoman Empire. Thirteen public sessions held in Ferrara from 8 October to 13 December 1438 the question was debated without agreement. The Greeks held that any addition whatever, even if doctrinally correct, to the Creed had been forbidden by Ephesus I, while the Latins claimed that this prohibition concerned meaning, not words.

During the Council of Florence in 1439, accord continued to be elusive, until the argument prevailed among the Greeks themselves that, though the Greek and the Latin saints expressed their faith differently, they were in agreement substantially, since saints cannot err in faith; and by 8 June the Greeks accepted the Latin statement of doctrine. Joseph II died on 10 June. A statement on the question was included in the decree of union, which was signed on 5 July 1439 and promulgated the next day – Mark of Ephesus was the only bishop not to sign the agreement.

The Eastern Church refused to consider the agreement reached at Florence binding, since the death of Joseph II had for the moment left it without a Patriarch of Constantinople. There was strong opposition to the agreement in the East, and when in 1453, 14 years after the agreement, the promised military aid from the West still had not arrived and Constantinople fell to the Turks, neither Eastern Christians nor their new rulers wished union between them and the West.

===Councils of Jerusalem, AD 1583 and 1672===
The Synod of Jerusalem (1583) condemned those who do not believe the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone in essence, and from Father and Son in time. In addition, this synod re-affirmed adherence to the decisions of Nicaea I. The Synod of Jerusalem (1672) similarly re-affirmed procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father alone.

===Reformation===
Although the Protestant Reformation challenged a number of church doctrines, they accepted the without reservation. However, they did not have a polemical insistence on the Western view of the Trinity. In the second half of the 16th century, Lutheran scholars from the University of Tübingen initiated a dialogue with the Patriarch Jeremias II of Constantinople. The Tübingen Lutherans defended the arguing that, without it, &quot;the doctrine of the Trinity would lose its epistemological justification in the history of revelation.&quot; In the centuries that followed, the was considered by Protestant theologians to be a key component of the doctrine of the Trinity, although it was never elevated to being a pillar of Protestant theology. Zizioulas characterizes Protestants as finding themselves &quot;in the same confusion as those fourth century theologians who were unable to distinguish between the two sorts of procession, &#x27;proceeding from&#x27; and &#x27;sent by&#x27;.&quot;

==Present position of various churches==

=== Catholic Church ===
The Catholic Church holds, as a truth dogmatically defined since as far back as Pope Leo I in 447, who followed a Latin and Alexandrian tradition, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. It rejects the notion that the Holy Spirit proceeds jointly and equally from two principles (Father and Son) and teaches dogmatically that &quot;the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son, not as from two principles but as from one single principle&quot;. It holds that the Father, as the &quot;principle without principle&quot;, is the first origin of the Spirit, but also that he, as Father of the only Son, is with the Son the single principle from which the Spirit proceeds.

It also holds that the procession of the Holy Spirit can be expressed as &quot;from the Father through the Son&quot;. The agreement that brought about the 1595 Union of Brest expressly declared that those entering full communion with Rome &quot;should remain with that which was handed down to (them) in the Holy Scriptures, in the Gospel, and in the writings of the holy Greek Doctors, that is, that the Holy Spirit proceeds, not from two sources and not by a double procession, but from one origin, from the Father through the Son&quot;.

The Catholic Church recognizes that the Creed, as confessed at the First Council of Constantinople, did not add &quot;and the Son&quot;, when it spoke of the Holy Spirit as proceeding from the Father, and that this addition was admitted to the Latin liturgy between the 8th and 11th centuries. When quoting the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, as in the 2000 document &quot;Dominus Iesus&quot;, it does not include &quot;Filioque&quot;. It views as complementary the Eastern-tradition expression &quot;who proceeds from the Father&quot; (profession of which it sees as affirming that the Spirit comes from the Father through the Son) and the Western-tradition expression &quot;who proceeds from the Father and the Son&quot;, with the Eastern tradition expressing firstly the Father&#x27;s character as first origin of the Spirit, and the Western tradition giving expression firstly to the consubstantial communion between Father and Son.

The monarchy of the Father is a doctrine upheld not only by those who, like Photius, speak of a procession from the Father alone. It is also asserted by theologians who speak of a procession from the Father through the Son or from the Father and the Son. Examples cited by Siecienski include Bessarion, Maximus the Confessor, Bonaventure, and the Council of Worms (868), The same remark is made by Jürgen Moltmann. The Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity (PCPCU) also stated that not only the Eastern tradition, but also the Latin &quot;Filioque&quot; tradition &quot;recognize that the &#x27;Monarchy of the Father&#x27; implies that the Father is the sole Trinitarian Cause () or Principle (&quot;&quot;) of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&quot;.

The Catholic Church recognizes that, in the Greek language, the term used in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed (, &quot;proceeding&quot;) to signify the proceeding of the Holy Spirit cannot appropriately be used with regard to the Son, but only with regard to the Father, a difficulty that does not exist in other languages. For this reason, even in the liturgy of Latin Church Catholics, it does not add the phrase corresponding to &quot;Filioque&quot; () to the Greek language text of the Creed containing the word . Even in languages other than Greek, it encourages Eastern Catholic Churches to omit the &quot;Filioque&quot; from their recitation of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, even in Eastern Catholic liturgies that previously included it.

===Anglicanism===
The 1978 and 1988 Lambeth Conferences advised the Anglican Communion to omit printing the &quot;Filioque&quot; in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. In 1993, a joint meeting of the Anglican Primates and Anglican Consultative Council, passed a resolution urging Anglican churches to comply with the request to print the liturgical Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed without the &quot;Filioque&quot; clause. The recommendation was not specifically renewed in the 1998 and 2008 Lambeth Conferences and has not been implemented.

In 1985 the General Convention of The Episcopal Church (USA) recommended that the &quot;Filioque&quot; clause should be removed from the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, if this were endorsed by the 1988 Lambeth Council. Accordingly, at its 1994 General Convention, the Episcopal Church reaffirmed its intention to remove the &quot;Filioque&quot; clause from the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed in the next revision of its Book of Common Prayer. The Episcopal Book of Common Prayer was last revised in 1979, and has not been revised since the resolution.

The Scottish Episcopal Church does not print the &quot;Filioque&quot; clause in its modern language liturgy (published 1982), though previous liturgies from 1929 and 1970, which have the &quot;Filioque&quot; remain authorised. The 1987 revision of the Scottish Liturgy of 1970 did not remove the Filioque clause, although it had already been omitted from the 1982 liturgy, promulgated five years earlier.

===Protestantism===
Among 20th-century Protestant theologians, Karl Barth was perhaps the staunchest defender of the &quot;Filioque&quot; doctrine. Barth was harshly critical of the ecumenical movement which advocated dropping the &quot;Filioque&quot; in order to facilitate reunification of the Christian churches. Barth&#x27;s vigorous defence of the &quot;Filioque&quot; ran counter to the stance of many Protestant theologians of the latter half of the 20th century who favoured abandoning the use of the &quot;Filioque&quot; in the liturgy.

The Moravian Church has never used the &quot;Filioque&quot;.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===

There has never been a specific conciliar statement in the Orthodox Church which defined the &quot;filioque&quot; as heresy.

The Eastern Orthodox interpretation is that the Holy Spirit originates, has his cause for existence or being (manner of existence) from the Father alone as &quot;One God, One Father&quot;,
Lossky insisted that any notion of a double procession of the Holy Spirit from both the Father and the Son was incompatible with Eastern Orthodox theology. For Lossky, this incompatibility was so fundamental that &quot;whether we like it or not, the question of the procession of the Holy Spirit has been the sole dogmatic grounds of the separation of East and West&quot;. Eastern Orthodox scholars who share Lossky&#x27;s view include Dumitru Stăniloae, John Romanides, Christos Yannaras, and Michael Pomazansky. Sergei Bulgakov, however, was of the opinion that the &quot;Filioque&quot; did not represent an insurmountable obstacle to reunion of the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches.

====Views of Eastern Orthodox saints====
Although Maximus the Confessor declared that it was wrong to condemn the Latins for speaking of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son, the addition of the &quot;Filioque&quot; to the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed was condemned as heretical by other saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church, including Photius the Great, Gregory Palamas and Mark of Ephesus, sometimes referred to as the Three Pillars of Orthodoxy. However, the statement &quot;The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son&quot; can be understood in an orthodox sense if it is clear from the context that &quot;procession from the Son&quot; refers to the sending forth of the Spirit &quot;in time&quot;, not to an eternal, double procession within the Trinity itself which gives the Holy Spirit existence or being. Hence, in Eastern Orthodox thought, Maximus the Confessor justified the Western use of the &quot;Filioque&quot; in a context other than that of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. and &quot;defended as a legitimate variation of the Eastern formula that the Spirit proceeds from the Father &quot;through&quot; the Son&quot;. Saint Theophylact of Ohrid likewise maintained that the difference was linguistic in nature and not really theological, urging a spirit of conciliation on both sides over a matter of customs.

According to Metropolitan Hierotheos (Vlachos) of Nafpaktos, an Eastern Orthodox tradition is that Gregory of Nyssa composed the section of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed referring to the Holy Spirit adopted by the Second Ecumenical Council at Constantinople in 381. Siecienski doubts that Gregory of Nyssa would have endorsed the addition of the &quot;Filioque&quot;, as later understood in the West, into the Creed, notwithstanding that Gregory of Nyssa reasoned &quot;there is an eternal, and not simply economic, relationship of the Spirit to the Son&quot;.

====Eastern Orthodox view of Roman Catholic theology====
Eastern Orthodox theologians (e.g. Pomazansky) say that the Nicene Creed as a Symbol of Faith, as dogma, is to address and define church theology specifically the Orthodox Trinitarian understanding of God. In the hypostases of God as correctly expressed against the teachings considered outside the church. The Father hypostasis of the Nicene Creed is the origin of all. Eastern Orthodox theologians have stated that New Testament passages (often quoted by the Latins) speak of the economy rather than the ontology of the Holy Spirit, and that in order to resolve this conflict Western theologians made further doctrinal changes, including declaring all persons of the Trinity to originate in the essence of God (the heresy of Sabellianism). Eastern Orthodox theologians see this as teaching of philosophical speculation rather than from actual experience of God via &quot;theoria&quot;.

The Father is the eternal, infinite and uncreated reality, that the Christ and the Holy Spirit are also eternal, infinite and uncreated, in that their origin is not in the &quot;ousia&quot; of God, but that their origin is in the hypostasis of God called the Father. The double procession of the Holy Spirit bears some resemblance to the teachings of Macedonius I of Constantinople and his sect called the Pneumatomachians in that the Holy Spirit is created by the Son and a servant of the Father and the Son. It was Macedonius&#x27; position that caused the specific wording of the section on the Holy Spirit by St Gregory of Nyssa in the finalized Nicene creed.

The following are some Roman Catholic dogmatic declarations of the &quot;Filioque&quot; which are in contention with Eastern Orthodoxy:
# The Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215): &quot;The Father is from no one, the Son from the Father only, and the Holy Spirit equally from both.&quot;
# The Second Council of Lyon, session 2 (1274): &quot; the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from Father and Son, not as from two principles, but as from one, not by two spirations, but by one only.&quot;
# The Council of Florence, session 6 (1439): &quot;We declare that when holy doctors and fathers say that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son, this bears the sense that thereby also the Son should be signified, according to the Greeks indeed as cause, and according to the Latins as principle of the subsistence of the Holy Spirit, just like the Father.&quot;
# The Council of Florence, session 8 in &quot;Laetentur Caeli&quot; (1439), on union with the Greeks: &quot;The Holy Spirit is eternally from Father and Son; He has his nature and subsistence at once (simul) from the Father and the Son. He proceeds eternally from both as from one principle and through one spiration. ... And, since the Father has through generation given to the only-begotten Son everything that belongs to the Father, except being Father, the Son has also eternally from the Father, from whom he is eternally born, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son.&quot;
# The Council of Florence, session 11 (1442), in &quot;Cantate Domino&quot;, on union with the Copts and Ethiopians: &quot;Father, Son and Holy Spirit; one in essence, three in persons; unbegotten Father, Son begotten from the Father, holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son; ... the Holy Spirit alone proceeds at once from the Father and the Son. ... Whatever the Holy Spirit is or has, he has from the Father together with the Son. But the Father and the Son are not two principles of the Holy Spirit, but one principle, just as the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit are not three principles of creation but one principle.&quot;
# In particular the condemnation, made at the Second Council of Lyons, session 2 (1274), of those &quot;who deny that the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son or who assert that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son as from two principles, not from one.&quot;

In the judgment of these Orthodox, the Roman Catholic Church is in fact teaching as a matter of Roman Catholic dogma that the Holy Spirit derives his origin and being (equally) from both the Father and the Son, making the &quot;Filioque&quot; a double procession..

They perceive the West as teaching through more than one type of theological &quot;Filioque&quot; a different origin and cause of the Holy Spirit; that through the dogmatic Roman Catholic &quot;Filioque&quot; the Holy Spirit is subordinate to the Father and the Son and not a free, independent and equal to the Father hypostasis that receives his uncreatedness from the origin of all things, the Father hypostasis. Trinity expresses the idea of message, messenger and revealer, or mind, word and meaning. Eastern Orthodox Christians believe in one God the Father, whose person is uncaused and unoriginate, who, because He is love and communion, always exists with His Word and Spirit.

====Eastern Orthodox theology====
In Eastern Orthodox Christianity theology starts with the Father hypostasis, not the essence of God, since the Father is the God of the Old Testament. The Father is the origin of all things and this is the basis and starting point of the Orthodox trinitarian teaching of one God in Father, one God, of the essence of the Father (as the uncreated comes from the Father as this is what the Father is). In Eastern Orthodox theology, God&#x27;s uncreatedness or being or essence in Greek is called &quot;ousia&quot;. Jesus Christ is the Son (God Man) of the uncreated Father (God). The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the uncreated Father (God).

God has existences (hypostases) of being; this concept is translated as the word &quot;person&quot; in the West. Each hypostasis of God is a specific and unique existence of God. Each has the same essence (coming from the origin, without origin, Father (God) they are uncreated). Each specific quality that constitutes an hypostasis of God, is non-reductionist and not shared. The issue of ontology or being of the Holy Spirit is also complicated by the &quot;Filioque&quot; in that the Christology and uniqueness of the hypostasis of Jesus Christ would factor into the manifestation of the Holy Spirit. In that Jesus is both God and Man, which fundamentally changes the hypostasis or being of the Holy Spirit, as Christ would be giving to the Holy Spirit an origin or being that was both God the Father (Uncreated) and Man (createdness).

The immanence of the Trinity that was defined in the finalized Nicene Creed. The economy of God, as God expresses himself in reality (his energies) was not what the Creed addressed directly. The specifics of God&#x27;s interrelationships of his existences, are not defined within the Nicene Creed. The attempt to use the Creed to explain God&#x27;s energies by reducing God existences to mere energies (actualities, activities, potentials) could be perceived as the heresy of semi-Sabellianism by advocates of Personalism, according to Meyendorff. Eastern Orthodox theologians have complained about this problem in the Roman Catholic dogmatic teaching of &quot;actus purus&quot;.

==== Modern theology ====

Modern Orthodox theological scholarship is split, according to William La Due, between a group of scholars that hold to a &quot;strict traditionalism going back to Photius&quot; and other scholars &quot;not so adamantly opposed to the &quot;filioque&quot;&quot;. The &quot;strict traditionalist&quot; camp is exemplified by the stance of Lossky who insisted that any notion of a double procession of the Holy Spirit from both the Father and the Son was incompatible with Orthodox theology. For Lossky, this incompatibility was so fundamental that, &quot;whether we like it or not, the question of the procession of the Holy Spirit has been the sole dogmatic grounds of the separation of East and West&quot;. Bulgakov, however, was of the opinion that the &quot;Filioque&quot; did not represent an insurmountable obstacle to reunion of the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, an opinion shared by .

Not all Orthodox theologians share the view taken by Lossky, Stăniloae, Romanides and Pomazansky, who condemn the &quot;Filioque&quot;. Kallistos Ware considers this the &quot;rigorist&quot; position within the Orthodox Church. Ware states that a more &quot;liberal&quot; position on this issue &quot;was the view of the Greeks who signed the act of union at Florence. It is a view also held by many Orthodox at the present time&quot;. He writes that &quot;according to the &#x27;liberal&#x27; view, the Greek and the Latin doctrines on the procession of the Holy Spirit may both alike be regarded as theologically defensible. The Greeks affirm that the Spirit proceeds from the Father &quot;through&quot; the Son, the Latins that He proceeds from the Father &quot;and&quot; from the Son; but when applied to the relationship between Son and Spirit, these two prepositions &#x27;through&#x27; and &#x27;from&#x27; amount to the same thing.&quot; The &quot;Encyclopedia of Christian Theology&quot; lists Bolotov, Paul Evdokimov, I. Voronov and S. Bulgakov as seeing the &quot;Filioque&quot; as a permissible theological opinion or &quot;theologoumenon&quot;. Bolotov defined theologoumena as theological opinions &quot;of those who for every catholic are more than just theologians: they are the theological opinions of the holy fathers of the one undivided church&quot;, opinions that Bolotov rated highly but that he sharply distinguished from dogmas.

Bulgakov wrote, in &quot;The Comforter&quot;, that:

Karl Barth considered that the view prevailing in Eastern Orthodoxy was that of Bolotov, who pointed out that the Creed does not deny the &quot;Filioque&quot; and who concluded that the question had not caused the division and could not constitute an absolute obstacle to intercommunion between the Eastern Orthodox and the Old Catholic Church. David Guretzki wrote, in 2009, that Bolotov&#x27;s view is becoming more prevalent among Orthodox theologians; and he quotes Orthodox theologian Theodore Stylianopoulos as arguing that &quot;the theological use of the &quot;filioque&quot; in the West against Arian subordinationism is fully valid according to the theological criteria of the Eastern tradition&quot;.

Yves Congar stated in 1954 that &quot;the greater number of the Orthodox say that the &quot;Filioque&quot; is not a heresy or even a dogmatic error but an admissible theological opinion, a &#x27;theologoumenon; and he cited 12th century bishop Nicetas of Nicomedia; 19th century philosopher Vladimir Solovyov; and 20th century writers Bolotov, Florovsky, and Bulgakov.

===Oriental Orthodox Churches===

All Oriental Orthodox Churches (Coptic, Syriac, Armenian, Ethiopian, Eritrean, Malankaran) use the original Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, without the Filioque clause.

===Church of the East===
Two of the present-day churches derived from the Church of the East, the Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East, do not use &quot;and the Son&quot; when reciting the Nicene Creed. A third, the Chaldean Catholic Church, a &quot;sui iuris&quot; Eastern Catholic Church, in 2007 at the request of the Holy See, removed &quot;and the Son&quot; from its version of the Nicene Creed.

==Recent theological perspectives==
===Linguistic issues===
Ware suggests that the problem is of semantics rather than of basic doctrinal differences. The English Language Liturgical Consultation commented that &quot;those who strongly favour retention of the &quot;Filioque&quot; are often thinking of the Trinity as revealed and active in human affairs, whereas the original Greek text is concerned about relationships within the Godhead itself. As with many historic disputes, the two parties may not be discussing the same thing.&quot;

In 1995, the pointed out an important difference in meaning between the Greek verb and the Latin verb &quot;&quot;, both of which are commonly translated as &quot;proceed&quot;. It stated that the Greek verb indicates that the Spirit &quot;takes his origin from the Father ... in a principal, proper and immediate manner&quot;, while the Latin verb, which corresponds rather to the verb in Greek, can be applied to proceeding even from a mediate channel. Therefore, (&quot;who proceeds&quot;), used in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed to signify the proceeding of the Holy Spirit, cannot be appropriately used in the Greek language with regard to the Son, but only with regard to the Father, a difficulty that does not exist in Latin and other languages.

Metropolitan John Zizioulas, while maintaining the explicit Orthodox position of the Father as the single origin and source of the Holy Spirit, declared that shows positive signs of reconciliation. Zizioulas states: &quot;Closely related to the question of the single cause is the problem of the exact meaning of the Son&#x27;s involvement in the procession of the Spirit. Gregory of Nyssa explicitly admits a &#x27;mediating&#x27; role of the Son in the procession of the Spirit from the Father. Is this role to be expressed with the help of the preposition (through) the Son (), as Maximus and other Patristic sources seem to suggest?&quot; Zizioulas continues: &quot;The Vatican statement notes that this is &#x27;the basis that must serve for the continuation of the current theological dialogue between Catholic and Orthodox&#x27;. I would agree with this, adding that the discussion should take place in the light of the &#x27;single cause&#x27; principle to which I have just referred.&quot; Zizioulas adds that this &quot;constitutes an encouraging attempt to clarify the basic aspects of the &#x27;Filioque&#x27; problem and show that a rapprochement between West and East on this matter is eventually possible&quot;.

===Some Orthodox reconsideration of the &quot;Filioque&quot;===
Russian theologian Boris Bolotov asserted in 1898 that the &quot;Filioque&quot;, like Photius&#x27;s &quot;from the Father &quot;alone&quot;&quot;, was a permissible theological opinion (a theologoumenon, not a dogma) that cannot be an absolute impediment to reestablishment of communion. Bolotov&#x27;s thesis was supported by Orthodox theologians Bulgakov, Paul Evdokimov and I. Voronov, but was rejected by Lossky.

In 1986, Theodore Stylianopoulos provided an extensive, scholarly overview of the contemporary discussion. Ware said that he had changed his mind and had concluded that &quot;the problem is more in the area of semantics and different emphases than in any basic doctrinal differences&quot;: &quot;the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone&quot; and &quot;the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son&quot; may &quot;both&quot; have orthodox meanings if the words translated &quot;proceeds&quot; actually have different meanings. For some Orthodox, then, the &quot;Filioque&quot;, while still a matter of conflict, would not impede full communion of the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches if other issues were resolved. But 19th century Russian Slavophile theologian Aleksey Khomyakov considered the &quot;Filioque&quot; as an expression of formalism, rationalism, pride and lack of love for other Christians, and that it is in flagrant contravention of the words of Christ in the Gospel, has been specifically condemned by the Orthodox Church, and remains a fundamental heretical teaching which divides East and West.

Romanides too, while personally opposing the &quot;Filioque&quot;, stated that Constantinople I was not ever interpreted &quot;as a condemnation&quot; of the doctrine &quot;outside the Creed, since it did not teach that the Son is &#x27;cause&#x27; or &#x27;co-cause&#x27; of the existence of the Holy Spirit. This could not be added to the Creed where &#x27;procession&#x27; means &#x27;cause&#x27; of existence of the Holy Spirit.&quot;

===Inclusion in the Nicene Creed===

Eastern Orthodox Christians object that, even if the teaching of the &quot;Filioque&quot; can be defended, its medieval interpretation and unilateral interpolation into the Creed is anti-canonical and unacceptable. &quot;The Catholic Church acknowledges the conciliar, ecumenical, normative and irrevocable value, as expression of the one common faith of the Church and of all Christians, of the Symbol professed in Greek at Constantinople in 381 by the Second Ecumenical Council. No profession of faith peculiar to a particular liturgical tradition can contradict this expression of the faith taught and professed by the undivided Church.&quot; The Catholic Church allows liturgical use of the Apostles&#x27; Creed as well of the Nicene Creed, and sees no essential difference between the recitation in the liturgy of a creed with orthodox additions and a profession of faith outside the liturgy such that of Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople, who developed the Nicene Creed with an addition as follows: &quot;the Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of life, who proceeds from the Father &quot;through the Son&quot;&quot;. It sees the addition of &quot;and the Son&quot; in the context of the Latin &#x27; (who proceeds from the Father) as an elucidation of the faith expressed by the Church Fathers, since the verb &#x27; signifies &quot;the communication of the consubstantial divinity from the Father to the Son and from the Father, through and with the Son, to the Holy Spirit&quot;.

Most Oriental Orthodox churches have not added the &quot;Filoque&quot; to their creeds but the Armenian Apostolic Church has added elucidations to the Nicene Creed. Another change made to the text of the Nicene Creed by both the Latins and the Greeks is to use the singular &quot;I believe&quot; in place of the plural &quot;we believe&quot;, while all the Churches of Oriental Orthodoxy, not only the Armenian, but also the Coptic Orthodox Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Malankara Orthodox Church, and the Syriac Orthodox Church, have on the contrary preserved the &quot;we believe&quot; of the original text.

===Focus on Saint Maximus as a point of mutual agreement===
Recently, theological debate about the &quot;Filioque&quot; has focused on the writings of Maximus the Confessor. Siecienski writes that &quot;Among the hundreds of figures involved in the filioque debates throughout the centuries, Maximus the Confessor enjoys a privileged position.&quot; During the lengthy proceedings at Ferrara-Florence, the Orthodox delegates presented a text from Maximus the Confessor that they felt could provide the key to resolving the theological differences between East and West.

The states that, according to Maximus, the phrase &quot;and from the Son&quot; does not contradict the Holy Spirit&#x27;s procession from the Father as first origin (ἐκπόρευσις), since it concerns only the Holy Spirit&#x27;s coming (in the sense of the Latin word &quot;&quot; and Cyril of Alexandria&#x27;s ) from the Son in a way that excludes any idea of subordinationism.

Orthodox theologian and Metropolitan of Pergamon, John Zizioulas, wrote that for Maximus the Confessor &quot;the Filioque was not heretical because its intention was to denote not the () but the () of the Spirit&quot;.

Zizioulas also wrote that &quot;Maximus the Confessor insisted, however, in defence of the Roman use of the Filioque, the decisive thing in this defence lies precisely in the point that in using the Filioque the Romans do not imply a &quot;cause&quot; other than the Father. The notion of &quot;cause&quot; seems to be of special significance and importance in the Greek Patristic argument concerning the Filioque. If Roman Catholic theology would be ready to admit that the Son in no way constitutes a &quot;cause&quot; (aition) in the procession of the Spirit, this would bring the two traditions much closer to each other with regard to the Filioque.&quot; This is precisely what Maximus said of the Roman view, that &quot;they have shown that they have not made the Son the cause of the Spirit – they know in fact that the Father is the only cause of the Son and the Spirit, the one by begetting and the other by procession&quot;.

The upholds the monarchy of the Father as the &quot;sole Trinitarian Cause [&quot;aitia&quot;] or principle [&quot;principium&quot;] of the Son and the Holy Spirit&quot;. While the Council of Florence proposed the equivalency of the two terms &quot;cause&quot; and &quot;principle&quot; and therefore implied that the Son is a cause (&quot;aitia&quot;) of the subsistence of the Holy Spirit, the distinguishes &quot;between what the Greeks mean by &#x27;procession&#x27; in the sense of taking origin from, applicable only to the Holy Spirit relative to the Father (&quot;ek tou Patros ekporeuomenon&quot;), and what the Latins mean by &#x27;procession&#x27; as the more common term applicable to both Son and Spirit (&quot;&quot;; &quot;ek tou Patros kai tou Huiou proion&quot;). This preserves the monarchy of the Father as the sole origin of the Holy Spirit while simultaneously allowing for an intratrinitarian relation between the Son and Holy Spirit that the document defines as &#x27;signifying the communication of the consubstantial divinity from the Father to the Son and from the Father through and with the Son to the Holy Spirit&#x27;.&quot;

Roman Catholic theologian Avery Dulles wrote that the Eastern fathers were aware of the currency of the &quot;Filioque&quot; in the West and did not generally regard it as heretical: Some, such as Maximus the Confessor, &quot;defended it as a legitimate variation of the Eastern formula that the Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son&quot;.

Pomazansky and Romanides hold that Maximus&#x27; position does not defend the actual way the Roman Catholic Church justifies and teaches the &quot;Filioque&quot; as dogma for the whole church. While accepting as a legitimate and complementary expression of the same faith and reality the teaching that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son, Maximus held strictly to the teaching of the Eastern Church that &quot;the Father is the only cause of the Son and the Spirit&quot;: and wrote a special treatise about this dogma. The Roman Catholic Church cites Maximus as in full accord with the teaching on the &quot;Filioque&quot; that it proposes for the whole Church as a dogma that is in harmony with the formula &quot;from the Father through the Son&quot;, for he explained that, by &quot;ekporeusis&quot;, &quot;the Father is the sole cause of the Son and the Spirit&quot;, but that, by , the Greek verb corresponding to &quot;&quot; (proceed) in Latin, the Spirit comes through the Son. Later again the Council of Florence, in 1438, declared that the Greek formula &quot;from the Father through the Son&quot; was equivalent to the Latin &quot;from the Father and the Son&quot;, not contradictory, and that those who used the two formulas &quot;were aiming at the same meaning in different words&quot;.

===&quot;Per Filium&quot;===
Recently, some Orthodox theologians have proposed the substitution of the formula &quot;ex Patre per Filium&quot; / &quot;εκ του Πατρός δια του Υιού&quot; (from the Father through the Son) instead of &quot;ex Patre Filioque&quot; (from the Father and the Son).

==Recent attempts at reconciliation==
Starting in the latter half of the nineteenth century, ecumenical efforts have gradually developed more nuanced understandings of the issues underlying the &quot;Filioque&quot; controversy and worked to remove them as an obstruction to Christian unity. Lossky insists that the &quot;Filioque&quot; is so fundamentally incompatible with Orthodox Christianity as to be the central issue dividing the two churches.

Western churches have arrived at the position that, although the &quot;Filioque&quot; is doctrinally sound, the way that it was inserted into the Nicene Creed has created an unnecessary obstacle to ecumenical dialogue. Thus, without abandoning the &quot;Filioque&quot;, some Western churches have come to accept that it could be omitted from the Creed without violating any core theological principles. This accommodation on the part of Western Churches has the objective of allowing both East and West to once again share a common understanding of the Creed as the traditional and fundamental statement of the Christian faith.

===Catholic Church===
Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI have recited the Nicene Creed jointly with Patriarchs Demetrius I and Bartholomew I in Greek without the &quot;Filioque&quot; clause.

===Old Catholic Church===
Immediately after the Old Catholic Church separated from the Catholic Church in 1871, its theologians initiated contact with the Orthodox Church. In 1874–75, representatives of the two churches held &quot;union conferences&quot; in Bonn with theologians of the Anglican Communion and the Lutheran Church in attendance in an unofficial capacity. The conferences discussed a number of issues including the filioque controversy. From the outset, Old Catholic theologians agreed with the Orthodox position that the &quot;Filioque&quot; had been introduced in the West in an unacceptably non-canonical way. It was at these Bonn conferences that the Old Catholics became the first Western church to omit the &quot;Filioque&quot; from the Nicene Creed.

===Anglican Communion===
Three Lambeth Conferences (1888, 1978 and 1988) have recommended that the &quot;Filioque&quot; be dropped from the Nicene Creed by churches that belong to the Anglican Communion.

The 1930 Lambeth Conference initiated formal theological dialogue between representatives of the Anglican and Orthodox churches. In 1976, the Agreed Statement of the Anglican-Orthodox Joint Doctrinal Commission recommended that the &quot;Filioque&quot; should be omitted from the Creed because its inclusion had been effected without the authority of an Ecumenical Council.

In 1994, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church (US) resolved that the &quot;Filioque&quot; should be deleted from the Nicene Creed in the next edition of the Prayer Book. The enthronement ceremonies of four recent archbishops of Canterbury (Robert Runcie, George Carey, Rowan Williams, Justin Welby) included recitations of the Nicene Creed that omitted the &quot;Filioque&quot;; this has been considered to have been &quot;a gesture of friendship toward Orthodox guests and their Communions&quot;.

At the end of October 2017 theologians from the Anglican Communion and Oriental Orthodox Churches signed an agreement on the Holy Spirit. This is the culmination of discussions which began in 2015. The statement of agreement confirms the omission of the Filioque clause.

===World Council of Churches===
In 1979, a study group of the World Council of Churches examined the &quot;Filioque&quot; question and recommended that &quot;the original form of the Creed, without the &quot;Filioque&quot;, should everywhere be recognized as the normative one and restored, so that the whole Christian people may be able ... to confess their common faith in the Holy Spirit&quot;. However, nearly a decade later, the WCC lamented that very few member churches had implemented this recommendation.

===Joint statement of Catholic and Eastern Orthodox theologians===

The &quot;Filioque&quot; was discussed at the 62nd meeting of the North American Orthodox–Catholic Theological Consultation, in 2002. As a result of these contemporary discussions between both churches, it has been suggested that the orthodox could accept an &quot;economic&quot; filioque that states that the Holy Spirit, who originates in the Father alone, was sent to the Church &quot;through the Son&quot; (as the Paraclete), but it would not be the official orthodox doctrine, but what the Fathers called a theologoumenon, a theological opinion.

In October 2003, the Consultation issued an agreed statement, &quot;The Filioque: a Church-dividing issue?&quot;, which provides an extensive review of Scripture, history, and theology. The recommendations include:

# That all involved in such dialogue expressly recognize the limitations of our ability to make definitive assertions about the inner life of God.
# That, in the future, because of the progress in mutual understanding that has come about in recent decades, Orthodox and Catholics refrain from labeling as heretical the traditions of the other side on the subject of the procession of the Holy Spirit.
# That Orthodox and Catholic theologians distinguish more clearly between the divinity and hypostatic identity of the Holy Spirit (which is a received dogma of our Churches) and the manner of the Spirit&#x27;s origin, which still awaits full and final ecumenical resolution.
# That those engaged in dialogue on this issue distinguish, as far as possible, the theological issues of the origin of the Holy Spirit from the ecclesiological issues of primacy and doctrinal authority in the Church, even as we pursue both questions seriously, together.
# That the theological dialogue between our Churches also give careful consideration to the status of later councils held in both our Churches after those seven generally received as ecumenical.
# That the Catholic Church, as a consequence of the normative and irrevocable dogmatic value of the Creed of 381, use the original Greek text alone in making translations of that Creed for catechetical and liturgical use.
# That the Catholic Church, following a growing theological consensus, and in particular the statements made by Pope Paul VI, declare that the condemnation made at the Second Council of Lyons (1274) of those &quot;who presume to deny that the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son&quot; is no longer applicable.

In the judgment of the consultation, the question of the &quot;Filioque&quot; is no longer a &quot;Church-dividing&quot; issue, which would impede full reconciliation and full communion. It is for the bishops of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches to review this work and to make whatever decisions would be appropriate.

==Summary==
While the Filioque doctrine was traditional in the West, being declared dogmatically in 447 by Pope Leo I, the Pope whose &quot;Tome&quot; was approved at the Council of Chalcedon, its inclusion in the Creed appeared in the anti-Arian situation of 7th-century Spain. However, this dogma was never accepted in the East. The &quot;Filioque&quot;, included in the Creed by certain anti-Arian councils in Spain, was a means to affirm the full divinity of the Son in relation to both the Father and the Spirit.

A similar anti-Arian emphasis also strongly influenced the development of the liturgy in the East, for example, in promoting prayer to &quot;Christ Our God&quot;, an expression which also came to find a place in the West, where, largely as a result of &quot;the Church&#x27;s reaction to Teutonic Arianism&quot;, Christ our God&#x27; ... gradually assumes precedence over &#x27;Christ our brother. In this case, a common adversary, namely Arianism, had profound, far-reaching effects, in the orthodox reaction in both East and West.

Church politics, authority conflicts, ethnic hostility, linguistic misunderstanding, personal rivalry, forced conversions, large scale wars, political intrigue, unfilled promises and secular motives all combined in various ways to divide East and West.

The doctrine expressed by the phrase in Latin (in which the word &quot;procedit&quot; that is linked with &quot;Filioque&quot; does not have exactly the same meaning and overtones as the word used in Greek) is definitively upheld by the Western Church, having been dogmatically declared by Leo I, and upheld by councils at Lyon and Florence that the Western Church recognizes as ecumenical, by the unanimous witness of the Latin Church Fathers (as Maximus the Confessor acknowledged) and even by Popes who, like Leo III, opposed insertion of the word into the Creed.

That the doctrine is heretical is something that not all Orthodox now insist on. According to Ware, many Orthodox (whatever may be the doctrine and practice of the Eastern Orthodox Church itself) hold that, in broad outline, to say the Spirit proceeds from the Father &quot;and&quot; the Son amounts to the same thing as to say that the Spirit proceeds from the Father &quot;through&quot; the Son, a view accepted also by the Greeks who signed the act of union at the Council of Florence. For others, such as Bolotov and his disciples, the &quot;Filioque&quot; can be considered a Western &quot;theologoumenon&quot;, a theological opinion of Church Fathers that falls short of being a dogma. Bulgakov also stated: &quot;There is no dogma of the relation of the Holy Spirit to the Son and therefore particular opinions on this subject are not heresies but merely dogmatic hypotheses, which have been transformed into heresies by the schismatic spirit that has established itself in the Church and that eagerly exploits all sorts of liturgical and even cultural differences.&quot;

<text>The Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) of the United States are a set of publicly announced standards that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed for use in computer situs of non-military United States government agencies and contractors. FIPS standards establish requirements for ensuring computer security and interoperability, and are intended for cases in which suitable industry standards do not already exist. AIR FIPS specifications are modified versions of standards the technical communities use, such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

==Specific areas of FIPS standardization==
The U.S. government has developed various FIPS specifications to standardize a number of topics including:

* Codes, e.g., FIPS county codes or codes to indicate weather conditions or emergency indications. In 1994, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) began broadcasting FIPS codes along with their standard weather broadcasts from local stations. These codes identify the type of emergency and the specific geographic area, such as a county, affected by the emergency.
* Encryption standards, such as AES (FIPS 197), and its predecessor, the withdrawn 56-bit DES (FIPS 46-3).

==Data security standards==
Some FIPS standards are related to the security of data processing systems. Some of these include the use of key escrow systems.

==Withdrawal of geographic codes==
Some examples of FIPS Codes for geographical areas include FIPS 10-4 for country codes or region codes and FIPS 5-2 for state codes. These codes were similar to or comparable with, but not the same as, ISO 3166, or the NUTS standard of the European Union. In 2002, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) withdrew several geographic FIPS code standards, including those for countries (FIPS 10-4), U.S. states (FIPS 5-2), and counties (FIPS 6-4). These are to be replaced by ISO 3166 and INCITS standards 38 and 31, respectively. Some of the codes maintain the previous numerical system, particularly for states.

In 2008, NIST withdrew the FIPS 55-3 database. This database included 5-digit numeric place codes for cities, towns, and villages, or other centers of population in the United States. The codes were assigned alphabetically to places within each state, and as a result changed frequently in order to maintain the alphabetical sorting. NIST replaced these codes with the more permanent GNIS Feature ID, maintained by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The GNIS database is the official geographic names repository database for the United States, and is designated the only source of geographic names and locative attributes for use by the agencies of the Federal Government. FIPS 8-6 &quot;Metropolitan Areas&quot; and 9-1 &quot;Congressional Districts of the U.S.&quot; were also withdrawn in 2008, to be replaced with INCITS standards 454 and 455, respectively.

The U.S. Census Bureau used FIPS place codes database to identify legal and statistical entities for county subdivisions, places, and American Indian areas, Alaska Native areas, or Hawaiian home lands when they needed to present census data for these areas.

In response to the NIST decision, the Census Bureau is in the process of transitioning over to the GNIS Feature ID, which will be completed after the 2010 census. Until then, previously issued FIPS place codes, renamed &quot;Census Code&quot;, will continue to be used, with the Census bureau assigning new codes as needed for their internal use during the transition.

<doc id="11114" wikidata="Q484181" url="?curid=11114" title="Fiqh">
<text>Fiqh (; ) is Islamic jurisprudence. &quot;Fiqh&quot; is often described as the style of human understanding and practices of the sharia; that is, human understanding of the divine Islamic law as revealed in the Quran and the sunnah (the teachings and practices of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions). Fiqh expands and develops Shariah through interpretation (&quot;ijtihad&quot;) of the Quran and &quot;Sunnah&quot; by Islamic jurists (&quot;ulama&quot;) and is implemented by the rulings (&quot;fatwa&quot;) of jurists on questions presented to them. Thus, whereas &quot;sharia&quot; is considered immutable and infallible by Muslims, &quot;fiqh&quot; is considered fallible and changeable. &quot;Fiqh&quot; deals with the observance of rituals, morals and social legislation in Islam as well as economic and political system. In the modern era, there are four prominent schools (&quot;madh&#x27;hab&quot;) of &quot;fiqh&quot; within Sunni practice, plus two (or three) within Shi&#x27;a practice. A person trained in &quot;fiqh&quot; is known as a &quot;faqīh&quot; (: &quot;fuqaha&quot;).

Figuratively, &quot;fiqh&quot; means knowledge about Islamic legal rulings from their sources. Deriving religious rulings from their sources requires the &quot;mujtahid&quot; (an individual who exercises &quot;ijtihad&quot;) to have a deep understanding in the different discussions of jurisprudence.

The studies of &quot;fiqh&quot;, are traditionally divided into &quot;Uṣūl al-fiqh&quot; (principles of Islamic jurisprudence, lit. the roots of fiqh, alternatively transliterated as &quot;Usool al-fiqh&quot;), the methods of legal interpretation and analysis; and &quot;Furūʿ al-fiqh&quot; (lit. the branches of fiqh), the elaboration of rulings on the basis of these principles. &quot;Furūʿ al-fiqh&quot; is the product of the application of &quot;Uṣūl al-fiqh&quot; and the total product of human efforts at understanding the divine will. A &quot;hukm&quot; (: &quot;aḥkām&quot;) is a particular ruling in a given case.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;fiqh&quot; is an Arabic term meaning &quot;deep understanding&quot; or &quot;full comprehension&quot;. Technically it refers to the body of Islamic law extracted from detailed Islamic sources (which are studied in the principles of Islamic jurisprudence) and the process of gaining knowledge of Islam through jurisprudence. The historian Ibn Khaldun describes &quot;fiqh&quot; as &quot;knowledge of the rules of God which concern the actions of persons who own themselves connected to obey the law respecting what is required (&quot;wajib&quot;), sinful (&quot;haraam&quot;), recommended (&quot;mandūb&quot;), disapproved (&quot;makrūh&quot;), or neutral (&quot;mubah&quot;)&quot;. This definition is consistent amongst the jurists.

In Modern Standard Arabic, &quot;fiqh&quot; has also come to mean Islamic jurisprudence. It is not thus possible to speak of Chief Justice John Roberts as an expert in the common law &quot;fiqh&quot; of the United States, or of Egyptian legal scholar Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri as an expert in the civil law &quot;fiqh&quot; of Egypt.

==History==

According to Sunni Islamic history, Sunni law followed a chronological path of:
*Allah → Muhammad → Companions → Followers → &quot;Fiqh&quot;.
The commands and prohibitions chosen by God were revealed through the agency of the Prophet in both the Quran and the Sunnah (words, deeds, and examples of the Prophet passed down as hadith). 
The first Muslims (the Sahabah or Companions) heard and obeyed, and passed this essence of Islam to succeeding generations (&quot;Tabi&#x27;un&quot; and &quot;Tabi&#x27; al-Tabi&#x27;in&quot; or successors/followers and successors of successors), as Muslims and Islam spread from West Arabia to the conquered lands north, east, and west, where it was systematized and elaborated. 

The history of Islamic jurisprudence is &quot;customarily divided into eight periods&quot;:
*the first period ending with the death of Muhammad in 11 AH.
*second period &quot;characterized by personal interpretations&quot; of the canon by the &quot;Sahabah&quot; or companions of Muhammad, lasting until 50 AH.
*from 50 AH until the early second century AH there was competition between &quot;a traditionalist approach to jurisprudence&quot; in western Arabia where Islam was revealed and a &quot;rationalist approach in Iraq&quot;.
*the &quot;golden age of classical Islamic jurisprudence&quot; from the &quot;early second to the mid-fourth century when the eight &quot;most significant&quot; schools of Sunni and Shi&#x27;i jurisprudence emerged.&quot;
*from the mid-fourth century to mid-seventh AH Islamic jurisprudence was &quot;limited to elaborations within the main juristic schools&quot;.
*the &quot;dark age&quot; of Islamic jurisprudence stretched from the fall of Baghdad in the mid-seventh AH (1258 CE) to 1293 AH/1876 CE.
*In 1293 AH (1876 CE) the Ottomans codified Hanafi jurisprudence in the &quot;Majallah el-Ahkam-i-Adliya&quot;. Several &quot;juristic revival movements&quot; influenced by &quot;exposure to Western legal and technological progress&quot; followed until the mid-20th century CE. Muhammad Abduh and Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri were products of this era. However, Abduh and El-Sanhuri were modernists. 19th century Ottoman Shariah Code was built on the views of the Hanafi school.
*The most recent era has been that of the &quot;Islamic revival&quot;, which has been &quot;predicated on rejection of Western social and legal advances&quot; and the development of specifically Islamic states, social sciences, economics, and finance.
The formative period of Islamic jurisprudence stretches back to the time of the early Muslim communities. During this period, jurists were more concerned with issues of authority and teaching than with theory and methodology.

Progress in theory and methodology happened with the coming of the early Muslim jurist Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi`i (767–820), who codified the basic principles of Islamic jurisprudence in his book &quot;ar-Risālah&quot;. The book details the four roots of law (Qur&#x27;an, sunnah, &quot;ijma&quot;, and &quot;qiyas&quot;) while specifying that the primary Islamic texts (the Qur&#x27;an and the hadith) be understood according to objective rules of interpretation derived from scientific study of the Arabic language.

Secondary sources of law were developed and refined over the subsequent centuries, consisting primarily of juristic preference (&quot;istihsan&quot;), laws of the previous prophets (&quot;shara man qablana&quot;), continuity (&quot;istishab&quot;), extended analogy (&quot;maslaha mursala&quot;), blocking the means (&quot;sadd al-dhari&#x27;ah&quot;), local customs (&quot;urf&quot;), and sayings of a companion of the Prophet (&quot;qawl al-sahabi&quot;).

=== Diagram of early scholars ===

The Quran set the rights, responsibilities, and rules for people and societies to adhere to, such as dealing in interest. Muhammad then provided an example, which is recorded in the hadith books, showing people how he practically implemented these rules in a society. After the passing of Muhammad, there was a need for jurists, to decide on new legal matters where there is no such ruling in the Quran or the hadith, example of Muhammad regarding a similar case.

In the years proceeding Muhammad, the community in Madina continued to use the same rules. People were familiar with the practice of Muhammad and therefore continued to use the same rules.

The scholars appearing in the diagram below were taught by Muhammad&#x27;s companions, many of whom settled in Madina. &quot;Muwatta&quot; by Malik ibn Anas was written as a consensus of the opinion, of these scholars. &quot;Muwatta&quot; by Malik ibn Anas quotes 13 hadiths from Imam Jafar al-Sadiq.
Aisha also taught her nephew Urwah ibn Zubayr. He then taught his son Hisham ibn Urwah, who was the main teacher of Malik ibn Anas whose views many Sunni follow and also taught by Jafar al-Sadiq. Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, Hisham ibn Urwah and Muhammad al-Baqir taught Zayd ibn Ali, Jafar al-Sadiq, Abu Hanifa, and Malik ibn Anas.

Imam Jafar al-Sadiq, Imam Abu Hanifa and Malik ibn Anas worked together in Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina. Along with Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, Muhammad al-Baqir, Zayd ibn Ali and over 70 other leading jurists and scholars.

Al-Shafi‘i was taught by Malik ibn Anas. Ahmad ibn Hanbal was taught by Al-Shafi‘i. Muhammad al-Bukhari travelled everywhere collecting hadith and his father Ismail ibn Ibrahim was a student of Malik ibn Anas.

In the books actually written by these original jurists and scholars, there are very few theological and judicial differences between them. Imam Ahmad rejected the writing down and codifying of the religious rulings he gave. They knew that they might have fallen into error in some of their judgements and stated this clearly. They never introduced their rulings by saying, &quot;Here, this judgement is the judgement of God and His prophet.&quot; There is also very little text actually written down by Jafar al-Sadiq himself. They all give priority to the Qur&#x27;an and the hadith (the practice of Muhammad). They felt that the Quran and the Hadith, the example of Muhammad provided people with almost everything they needed. &quot;This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion&quot; (Qur&#x27;an 5:3).

These scholars did not distinguish between each other. They were not Sunni or Shia. They felt that they were following the religion of Abraham as described in the Quran &quot;Say: Allah speaks the truth; so follow the religion of Abraham, the upright one. And he was not one of the polytheists&quot; (Qur&#x27;an 3:95).

Most of the differences are regarding Sharia laws devised through Ijtihad where there is no such ruling in the Quran or the hadiths of Islamic prophet Muhammad regarding a similar case. As these jurists went to new areas, they were pragmatic and continued to use the same ruling as was given in that area during pre-Islamic times, if the population felt comfortable with it, it was just and they used Ijtihad to deduce that it did not conflict with the Quran or the Hadith. As explained in the &quot;Muwatta&quot; by Malik ibn Anas. This made it easier for the different communities to integrate into the Islamic State and assisted in the quick expansion of the Islamic State.

To reduce the divergence, ash-Shafi&#x27;i proposed giving priority to the Qur&#x27;an and the Hadith (the practice of Muhammad) and only then look at the consensus of the Muslim jurists (&quot;ijma&quot;) and analogical reasoning (&quot;qiyas&quot;). This then resulted in jurists like Muhammad al-Bukhari dedicating their lives to the collection of the correct hadith, in books like Sahih al-Bukhari (Sahih translates as authentic or correct). They also felt that Muhammad&#x27;s judgement was more impartial and better than their own.

These original jurists and scholars also acted as a counterbalance to the rulers. When they saw injustice, all these scholars spoke out against it. As the state expanded outside Madina, the rights of the different communities, as they were constituted in the Constitution of Medina still applied. The Quran also gave additional rights to the citizens of the state and these rights were also applied. Ali, Hassan and Husayn ibn Ali gave their allegiance to the first three caliphs because they abided by these conditions. Later Ali the fourth caliph wrote in a letter &quot;I did not approach the people to get their oath of allegiance but they came to me with their desire to make me their Amir (ruler). I did not extend my hands towards them so that they might swear the oath of allegiance to me but they themselves extended their hands towards me.&quot; But later as fate would have it (Predestination in Islam) when Yazid I, an Umayyad ruler took power, Husayn ibn Ali the grandson of Muhammad felt that it was a test from God for him and his duty to confront him. Then Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr&#x27;s cousin confronted the Umayyad rulers after Husayn ibn Ali was betrayed by the people of Kufa and killed by Syrian Roman Army now under the control of the Yazid I. Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr then took on the Umayyads and expelled their forces from Hijaz and Iraq. But then his forces were depleted in Iraq, trying to stop the Khawarij. The Umayyads then moved in. After a lengthy campaign, in his last hour Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr asked his mother Asma&#x27; bint Abu Bakr the daughter of Abu Bakr the first caliph for advice. Asma&#x27; bint Abu Bakr replied to her son, she said: &quot;You know better in your own self, that if you are upon the truth and you are calling towards the truth go forth, for people more honourable than you have been killed and if you are not upon the truth, then what an evil son you are and you have destroyed yourself and those who are with you. If you say, that if you are upon the truth and you will be killed at the hands of others, then you will not truly be free.&quot; Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr left and was later also killed and crucified by the Syrian Roman Army now under the control of the Umayyads and led by Hajjaj. Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr the son of Abu Bakr the first caliph and raised by Ali the fourth caliph was also killed by the Umayyads. Aisha then raised and taught her son Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr who later taught his grandson Jafar al-Sadiq.
During the early Umayyad period, there was more community involvement. The Quran and Muhammad&#x27;s example was the main source of law after which the community decided. If it worked for the community, was just and did not conflict with the Quran and the example of Muhammad, it was accepted. This made it easier for the different communities, with Roman, Persian, Central Asia and North African backgrounds to integrate into the Islamic State and that assisted in the quick expansion of the Islamic State. The scholars in Madina were consulted on the more complex judicial issues. The Sharia and the official more centralized schools of fiqh developed later, during the time of the Abbasids.

==Components==
The sources of Sharia in order of importance are
&lt;br&gt;Primary sources
#Qur&#x27;an
#Hadith
Secondary sources&lt;br&gt;
:3. Ijma, i.e. collective reasoning and consensus amongst authoritative Muslims of a particular generation, and its interpretation by Islamic scholars.&lt;br&gt;
:4. Ijtihad, i.e. independent legal reasoning by Islamic jurists.

Majority of Sunni Muslims view &quot;Qiyas&quot; as a central Pillar of &quot;Ijtihad&quot;. On the other hand; Zahirites, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Al-Bukhari, early Hanbalites, etc. rejected &quot;Qiyas&quot; amongst the Sunnis. Similarly, the &quot;Shi’a&quot; jurists almost unanimously reject both pure reason and analogical reason; viewing both these methods as subjective.

The Qur&#x27;an gives clear instructions on many issues, such as how to perform the ritual purification (&#x27;) before the obligatory daily prayers (&#x27;). On other issues, for example, the Qur&#x27;an states one needs to engage in daily prayers (&#x27;) and fast (&#x27;) during the month of Ramadan but further instructions and details on how to perform these duties can be found in the traditions of Muhammad, so Qur&#x27;an and Sunnah are in most cases the basis for (&quot;&quot;).

Some topics are without precedent in Islam&#x27;s early period. In those cases, Muslim jurists (&#x27;) try to arrive at conclusions by other means. Sunni jurists use historical consensus of the community (&#x27;); a majority in the modern era also use analogy (&#x27;) and weigh the harms and benefits of new topics (&#x27;), and a plurality utilizes juristic preference (&#x27;). The conclusions arrived at with the aid of these additional tools constitute a wide array of laws, and its application is called fiqh. Thus, in contrast to the &quot;sharia&quot;, &quot;fiqh&quot; is not regarded as sacred and the schools of thought have differing views on its details, without viewing other conclusions as sacrilegious. This division of interpretation in more detailed issues has resulted in different schools of thought (&#x27;).

This wider concept of Islamic jurisprudence is the source of a range of laws in different topics that guide Muslims in everyday life.

=== Component categories ===
Islamic jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;) covers two main areas:
# Rules in relation to actions, and,
# Rules in relation to circumstances surrounding actions.

These types of rules can also fall into two groups:
# Worship (Ibadaat)
# Dealings and transactions (with people) (Mu`amalaat)

Rules in relation to actions (&quot;&#x27;amaliyya&quot; — عملية) or &quot;decision types&quot; comprise:
# Obligation (&quot;fardh&quot;)
# Recommendation (&quot;mustahabb&quot;)
# Permissibility (&quot;mubah&quot;)
# Disrecommendation (&quot;makrooh&quot;)
# Prohibition (&quot;haraam&quot;)

Rules in relation to circumstances (&quot;wadia&quot;&#x27;) comprise:
# Condition (&quot;shart&quot;)
# Cause (&quot;sabab&quot;)
# Preventor (&quot;mani&quot;)
# Permit / Enforced (&quot;rukhsah, azeemah&quot;)
# Valid / Corrupt / Invalid (&quot;sahih, fasid, batil&quot;)
# In time / Deferred / Repeat (&quot;adaa, qadaa, i&#x27;ada&quot;)

=== Methodologies of jurisprudence ===
The modus operandi of the Muslim jurist is known as &quot;usul al-fiqh&quot; (&quot;principles of jurisprudence&quot;).

There are different approaches to the methodology used in jurisprudence to derive Islamic rulings from the primary sources of &quot;sharia&quot; (Islamic law). The main methodologies are those of the Sunni, Shi&#x27;a and Ibadi denominations. While both Sunni and Shi&#x27;ite (Shia) are divided into smaller sub-schools, the differences among the Shi&#x27;ite schools is considerably greater. Ibadites only follow a single school without divisions.

;Fatawa
While using court decisions as legal precedents and case law are central to Western law, the importance of the institution of fatawa (non-binding answers by Islamic legal scholars to legal questions) has been called &quot;central to the development&quot; of Islamic jurisprudence. This is in part because of a &quot;vacuum&quot; in the other source of Islamic law, &quot;qada`&quot; (legal rulings by state appointed Islamic judges) after the fall of the last caliphate the Ottoman Empire. While the practice in Islam dates back to the time of Muhammad, according to at least one source (Muhammad El-Gamal), it is &quot;modeled after the Roman system of &quot;responsa&quot;,&quot; and gives the questioner &quot;decisive primary-mover advantage in choosing the question and its wording.&quot;

;Arguments for and against reform
Each school (&quot;madhhab&quot;) reflects a unique &quot;urf&quot; or culture (a cultural practice that was influenced by traditions), that the classical jurists themselves lived in, when rulings were made. Some suggest that the discipline of &quot;isnad&quot;, which developed to validate &quot;hadith&quot; made it relatively easy to record and validate also the rulings of jurists. This, in turn, made them far easier to imitate (&quot;taqlid&quot;) than to challenge in new contexts. The argument is, the schools have been more or less frozen for centuries, and reflect a culture that simply no longer exists. Traditional scholars hold that religion is there to regulate human behavior and nurture people&#x27;s moral side and since human nature has not fundamentally changed since the beginning of Islam a call to modernize the religion is essentially one to relax all laws and institutions.

Early &quot;shariah&quot; had a much more flexible character, and some modern Muslim scholars believe that it should be renewed, and that the classical jurists should lose special status. This would require formulating a new fiqh suitable for the modern world, e.g. as proposed by advocates of the Islamization of knowledge, which would deal with the modern context. This modernization is opposed by most conservative &quot;ulema&quot;. Traditional scholars hold that the laws are contextual and consider circumstance such as time, place and culture, the principles they are based upon are universal such as justice, equality and respect. Many Muslim scholars argue that even though technology may have advanced, the fundamentals of human life have not.

=== Fields of jurisprudence ===
*Criminal
*Economics
*Etiquette
*Family
*Hygienical
*Inheritance
*Marital
*Military
*Political
*Theological
=== Schools of jurisprudence ===

There are several schools of fiqh thought ( &#x27;; pl. &#x27;)
The schools of Sunni Islam are each named by students of the classical jurist who taught them. The Sunni schools (and where they are commonly found) are
*Hanafi (Turkey, Egypt, Balkans, Levant, Central Asia, South Asia, China, North Caucasus, and Tatarstan)
*Maliki (North Africa, West Africa, and Eastern Arabia)
*Shafi&#x27;i (Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Kurdistan, Egypt, East Africa, Yemen, Kerala, and Maldives)
*Hanbali (Saudi Arabia); see Wahhabism
*Zahiri (minority communities in Morocco and Pakistan)
*Ahl al-Hadith
*Jariri, Laythi, Awza&#x27;i, Thawri, and Qurtubi no longer exist.

The schools of Shia Islam comprise:
*Ja&#x27;fari Twelver (Iran, Azerbaijan, Iraq, and Lebanon) 
*Ja&#x27;fari Isma&#x27;ili (minority communities in India, Central Asia, Levant, Yemen, and Pakistan)
*Zaydi (minority communities in Yemen)

Entirely separate from both the Sunni and Shia traditions, Khawarij Islam has evolved its own distinct school.
*Ibadi (Oman)

These schools share many of their rulings, but differ on the particular hadiths they accept as authentic and the weight they give to analogy or reason (qiyas) in deciding difficulties.

The relationship between (at least the Sunni) schools of jurisprudence and the conflict between the unity of the Shariah and the diversity of the schools, was expressed by the 12th century Hanafi scholar Abu Hafs Umar al-Nasafi, who wrote: &quot;Our school is correct with the possibility of error, and another school is in error with the possibility of being correct.&quot;

== Influence on Western laws ==
A number of important legal institutions were developed by Muslim jurists during the classical period of Islam, known as the Islamic Golden Age. One such institution was the &quot;Hawala&quot;, an early informal value transfer system, which is mentioned in texts of Islamic jurisprudence as early as the 8th century. &quot;Hawala&quot; itself later influenced the development of the agency in common law and in civil laws such as the &quot;aval&quot; in French law and the &quot;avallo&quot; in Italian law.

The &quot;Waqf&quot; in Islamic law, which developed during the 7th–9th centuries, bears a notable resemblance to the trusts in the English trust law. For example, every &quot;Waqf&quot; was required to have a &quot;waqif&quot; (settlor), &quot;mutawillis&quot; (trustee), &quot;qadi&quot; (judge) and beneficiaries. The trust law developed in England at the time of the Crusades, during the 12th and 13th centuries, was introduced by Crusaders who may have been influenced by the &quot;Waqf&quot; institutions they came across in the Middle East.

In classical Islamic jurisprudence, litigants in court may obtain notarized statements from between three and twelve witnesses. When the statements of all witnesses are consistent, the notaries will certify their unanimous testimony in a legal document, which may be used to support the litigant&#x27;s claim. The notaries serve to free the judge from the time-consuming task of hearing the testimony of each eyewitness himself, and their documents serve to legally authenticate each oral testimony. The Maliki school requires two notaries to collect a minimum of twelve eyewitness statements in certain legal cases, including those involving unregistered marriages and land disputes. John Makdisi has compared this group of twelve witness statements, known as a &quot;lafif&quot;, to English Common Law jury trials under Henry II, surmising a link between the king&#x27;s reforms and the legal system of the Kingdom of Sicily. The island had previously been ruled by various Islamic dynasties. 

Several other fundamental common law institutions may have been adapted from similar legal institutions in Islamic law and jurisprudence, and introduced to England by the Normans after the Norman conquest of England and the Emirate of Sicily, and by Crusaders during the Crusades. In particular, the &quot;royal English contract protected by the action of debt is identified with the Islamic &quot;Aqd&quot;, the English assize of novel disseisin is identified with the Islamic &quot;Istihqaq&quot;, and the English jury is identified with the Islamic &quot;lafif&quot;.&quot; John Makdisi speculated that English legal institutions such as &quot;the scholastic method, the licence to teach&quot;, the &quot;law schools known as Inns of Court in England and &quot;Madrasas&quot; in Islam&quot; and the &quot;European commenda&quot; (Islamic &quot;Qirad&quot;) may have also originated from Islamic law. The methodology of legal precedent and reasoning by analogy (&quot;Qiyas&quot;) are also similar in both the Islamic and common law systems. These influences have led some scholars to suggest that Islamic law may have laid the foundations for &quot;the common law as an integrated whole&quot;.

<text>The First Council of Nicaea ( ; ) was a council of Christian bishops convened in the Bithynian city of Nicaea (now İznik, Turkey) by the Roman Emperor Constantine I. The Council of Nicaea met from May until the end of July 325.

This ecumenical council was the first of many efforts to attain consensus in the church through an assembly representing all Christendom. Hosius of Corduba may have presided over its deliberations. Its main accomplishments were settlement of the Christological issue of the divine nature of God the Son and his relationship to God the Father, the construction of the first part of the Nicene Creed, mandating uniform observance of the date of Easter, and promulgation of early canon law.

== Background ==
=== Alexandrian controversies ===

The major impetus for the calling of the Council of Nicaea arose in a theological dispute among the Christian clergy of Alexandria concerning the nature of Jesus, his origin, and relation to God the Father. Scholars propose dates between 318 and 322 for the beginning of the dispute. The precise origins of the controversy are unclear, but the principal actors were Archbishop Alexander of Alexandria and the presbyter Arius. Arius&#x27; teachings are known partially from a few pieces of his writing which survive, but principally from his opponents, primarily Alexander and Athanasius of Alexandria. Arius criticized Alexander&#x27;s teachings on Christology; Alexander taught that Jesus as God the Son was eternally generated from the Father, while Arius and his followers asserted that the Father alone was eternal, and that the Son was created or begotten by the Father, and thus had a defined point of origin and was subordinate to the Father. Arius accused Alexander of following the teachings of Sabellius, who taught that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were one person, rather than the view held throughout the east that they were distinct. Alexander called a local council of bishops from Egypt and Libya, which sided with Alexander&#x27;s view. Arius refused to subscribe to the council&#x27;s decision, and he and several followers were excommunicated and exiled from Alexandria by Alexander. Arius then traveled to churches around the Roman east and wrote to bishops to gain support of his view. Among Arius&#x27; supporters were Eusebius of Nicomedia and Eusebius of Caesarea, and they advocated for his view and his restoration to the church in Alexandria. Alexander also circulated letters defending his own position.

Parallel to the theological controversy between Alexander and Arius was the Melitian schism in the Alexandrian church. Melitius, bishop of Lycopolis, had acted in the stead of the imprisoned bishop Peter I of Alexandria during the Diocletianic Persecution, but after Peter&#x27;s death in 311 refused to give up his right to ordain clergy or recognize the authority of Peter&#x27;s successors Achillas or Alexander.

=== Constantine and the calling of the council ===
In 324, the western Roman emperor Constantine defeated the eastern emperor Licinius and became the sole ruler of the Roman Empire. It was at this time that, likely from Eusebius of Nicomedia, he became aware of the controversy between Alexander and Arius. Constantine wrote a letter to the two, urging them to end their dispute and reconcile. This was not Constantine&#x27;s first direct involvement in ecclesiastical controversy; he had previously attempted to resolve a schism over Donatism in North Africa, first appointing Miltiades, Bishop of Rome to hear the dispute (with the instruction &quot;I do not wish you to leave schism or division of any kind anywhere.&quot;) and then calling the Council of Arles.

Constantine&#x27;s letter was carried to Alexandria by Bishop Hosius of Corduba as his representative. Hosius apparently then presided over a synod at Alexandria concerning the date of Easter, before calling a council of Eastern bishops in Antioch. This council endorsed Alexander&#x27;s position and issuing a statement of faith that held that the Son was &quot;begotten not from non-existence, but from the Father, not as made, but as genuine product&quot; and contained anathemas against Arius. Eusebius of Caesaria was also temporarily excommunicated because of his contention that the Father and the Son were of two different natures.

The bishops were then to assemble in Ancyra in Asia Minor for a &quot;great and hierarchic council&quot;, either at their own impetus or Constantine&#x27;s command. Constantine moved the council to Nicaea in Bithynia, a venue that would allow him to attend personally (due to its proximity to his capital at Nicomedia) and would allow easier access for bishops from throughout the empire. The emperor had also planned a commemoration of the twentieth year of his reign in Nicaea.

=== Attendance and logistics===
The expenses of the council, including the travel of the bishops, were paid by the imperial treasury. Contemporary reports of attendance range from 250 to 300, with the figure of 318 given by Athanasius of Antioch becoming traditionally accepted. 318 is also the number of members of Abraham&#x27;s household given in the Book of Genesis. Lists of signatories to the final decisions of the council contain 200–220 names. With presbyters and deacons attending each bishop, the total attendance may have been between 1200 and 1900. Most of the bishops were eastern, with about twenty from Egypt and Libya, another fifty from Palestine and Syria, and more than one hundred from Asia
Minor. One bishop each from Persia and Scythia were present. The few western attendees were Hosius, Caecilianus of Carthage, Nicasius of Die, Marcus of Calabria, Domnus of Pannonia, and Victor and Vicentius, two presbyters representing Bishop Sylvester of Rome. Of the eastern bishops, the principal supporters of Arius were Eusebius of Nicomedia, Eusebius of Caesarea, Menophantus of Ephesus, Patrophilus of Scythopolis, Narcissus of Neronias, Theonas of Marmarike, Secundus of Ptolemais, and Theognis of Nicaea. The principal anti-Arians included Alexander of Alexandria, Eustathius of Antioch, Marcellus of Ancyra and Macarius of Jerusalem.

The council was held in Nicea&#x27;s imperial palace. The bishops most likely assembled in a rectangular basilica hall based on Eusebius of Caearea&#x27;s description.

== Proceedings ==
Constantine opened the council with a formal entrance after the bishops arrived, with Eusebius describing him as &quot;like some heavenly angel of God, his bright mantle shedding lustre like beams of light, shining with the fiery radiance of a purple robe, and decorated with the dazzling brilliance of gold and precious stones.&quot; He then gave an opening speech in Latin (rather than the Greek spoken by most of the attendees). Fifth-century church historian Socrates of Constantinople gives the date of the opening as 20 May 325, though may have been later in June.

It is most likely that Hosius presided over the council&#x27;s debates and proceedings as Constantine&#x27;s representative. Constantine did join in the debates of the council (in Greek), but did not see himself as a voting member as he was not a bishop. No detailed &quot;acta&quot; of the council exist as they do for later councils, so the exact sequence of the council&#x27;s debates is uncertain. Church councils at the time were modeled after the proceedings of the Roman Senate, with the presiding officer having a large degree of control, and participants speaking in turn based on hierarchy. Probably the first matter considered was the status of Eusebius of Caesarea and the other bishops excommunicated at Antioch, as this would determine whether they could participate in the rest of the council. According to Eusebius, his profession of faith was accepted and he was restored. An account by Eustathius of Antioch records a statement of faith by a Eusebius being rejected by the council, though this was likely Eusebius of Nicomedia.

A statement of faith based on earlier creeds was drafted (possibly by a smaller committee), and each line was debated by the council. All but two bishops subscribed to the final form of the creed as adopted. In addition to the Arian question, the council also considered the calculation of Easter, and adopted the Roman and Alexandrian method over the objection of several eastern bishops. The bishops also agreed to a resolution on the Melitian schism and issued twenty canons. The council closed in the first weeks of July, with the bishops invited to attend Constantine&#x27;s celebration of his twentieth anniversary on the throne on 25 July. Both the bishops and the emperor issued letters recounting the councils&#x27; decisions to be circulated throughout the empire.

== Ecumenical Council ==
The First Council of Nicaea was the first ecumenical council of the church. Nicaea &quot;was the first time that any attempt had been made to summon a general council of the whole church at which, at least in theory, the church in every part of the Roman Empire should be represented&quot;.

Derived from Greek (), &quot;ecumenical&quot; means &quot;worldwide&quot; but generally is assumed to be limited to the known inhabited Earth, and at this time in history is nearly synonymous with the Roman Empire. The earliest extant uses of the term for a council are Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Life of Constantine&quot; around 338, which states &quot;he convoked an ecumenical council&quot; (, ) and a letter in 382 to Pope Damasus I and the Latin bishops from the First Council of Constantinople.

Historically significant as the first effort to attain consensus in the church through an assembly representing all of Christendom, the council was the first occasion where the technical aspects of Christology were discussed. Through it a precedent was set for subsequent general councils to adopt creeds and canons. This council is generally considered the beginning of the period of the first seven ecumenical councils in the history of Christianity.

== Outcomes ==
=== Nicene Creed ===
The Council formulated a creed, a declaration and summary of the Christian faith. Several creeds were already in existence; many creeds were acceptable to the members of the council, including Arius. From earliest times, various creeds served as a means of identification for Christians, as a means of inclusion and recognition, especially at baptism. In Rome, for example, the Apostles&#x27; Creed was popular, especially for use in Lent and the Easter season. In the Council of Nicaea, one specific creed was used to define the Church&#x27;s faith clearly, to include those who professed it, and to exclude those who did not.

The original Nicene Creed read as follows:

The creed was amended by the First Council of Constantinople in 381.

==== Distinctive elements ====
Some distinctive elements in the Nicene Creed, perhaps from the hand of Hosius of Cordova, were added, some specifically to counter the Arian point of view.

# Jesus Christ is described as &quot;Light from Light, true God from true God&quot;, proclaiming his divinity.
# Jesus Christ is said to be &quot;begotten, not made&quot;, asserting that he was not a mere creature, brought into being out of nothing, but the true Son of God, brought into being &quot;from the substance of the Father&quot;.
# He is said to be &quot;of one substance with the Father&quot;, proclaiming that although Jesus Christ is &quot;true God&quot; and God the Father is also &quot;true God&quot;, they are &quot;of one substance&quot;. The Greek term &quot;homoousios&quot;, consubstantial (i.e. of the &quot;same&quot; substance) is ascribed by Eusebius of Caesarea to Constantine who, on this particular point, may have chosen to exercise his authority. The significance of this clause, however, is ambiguous as to the extent in which Jesus Christ and God the Father are &quot;of one substance&quot;, and the issues it raised would be seriously controverted in the future.

==== Anathemas ====
At the end of the creed came a list of anathemas, designed to repudiate explicitly the Arians&#x27; stated claims.

# The view that &quot;there was once when he was not&quot; was rejected to maintain the coeternity of the Son with the Father.
# The view that he was &quot;mutable or subject to change&quot; was rejected to maintain that the Son just like the Father was beyond any form of weakness or corruptibility, and most importantly that he could not fall away from absolute moral perfection.

Thus, instead of a baptismal creed acceptable to both the Arians and their opponents, the Council promulgated one which was clearly opposed to Arianism and incompatible with the distinctive core of their beliefs. The text of this profession of faith is preserved in a letter of Eusebius to his congregation, in Athanasius&#x27; works, and elsewhere. The Homoousians (from the Koine Greek word translated as &quot;of same substance&quot; which was condemned at the Council of Antioch in 264–268) were supported by Constantine and Hosius and were able to advance the use of the term, thus the creed was accepted by the council.

==== Exiled ====
The emperor carried out his earlier statement: everybody who refused to endorse the creed would be exiled. Arius, Theonas, and Secundus refused to adhere to the creed and were thus exiled to Illyria, in addition to being excommunicated. The works of Arius were ordered to be confiscated and consigned to the flames, while his supporters were considered as &quot;enemies of Christianity&quot;. Nevertheless, the controversy continued in various parts of the empire.

=== Separation of Easter computation from Jewish calendar ===
The feast of Easter is linked to the Jewish Passover and Feast of Unleavened Bread, as Christians believe that the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus occurred at the time of those observances. As early as Pope Sixtus I in the 2nd century, some Christians had set Easter to a Sunday in the lunar month of Nisan. To determine which lunar month was to be designated as Nisan, Christians relied on the Jewish community. By the late 3rd century some Christians began to express dissatisfaction with what they took to be the disorderly state of the Jewish calendar. They argued that contemporary Jews were identifying the wrong lunar month as the month of Nisan, choosing a month whose 14th day fell before the spring equinox.

Christians, these thinkers argued, should abandon the custom of relying on Jewish informants and instead do their own computations to determine which month should be styled Nisan, setting Easter within this independently computed, Christian Nisan, which would always locate the festival after the equinox. They justified this break with tradition by arguing that it was in fact the contemporary Jewish calendar that had broken with tradition by ignoring the equinox and that in former times the 14th of Nisan had never preceded the equinox. Others felt that the customary practice of reliance on the Jewish calendar should continue, even if the Jewish computations were in error from a Christian point of view.

The controversy between those who argued for independent computations and those who argued for continued reliance on the Jewish calendar was formally resolved by the council, which endorsed the independent procedure that had been in use for some time at Rome and Alexandria. Easter was henceforward to be a Sunday in a lunar month chosen according to Christian criteria—in effect, a Christian Nisan—not in the month of Nisan as defined by Jews. Those who argued for continued reliance on the Jewish calendar (called &quot;protopaschites&quot; by later historians) were urged to come around to the majority position. That they did not all immediately do so is revealed by the existence of sermons, canons, and tracts written against the protopaschite practice in the late 4th century.

These two rules—independence of the Jewish calendar and worldwide uniformity—were the only rules for Easter explicitly laid down by the council. No details for the computation were specified; these were worked out in practice, a process that took centuries and generated numerous controversies, some of which remain unresolved. In particular, the Council did not seem to decree that Easter must fall on Sunday. This was unnecessary as it resolved against the &quot;Quartodecimani&quot;, who celebrated on any day of the week, in favour of the Churches who postponed the celebration to the following Sunday. See the extract from the &quot;Letter of the Council of Nicaea to the Egyptian Church&quot;, cited above.

Nor did the Council decree that Easter must never coincide with Nisan 15 (the first Day of Unleavened Bread, now commonly called &quot;Passover&quot;) in the Hebrew calendar. The Finnish Orthodox Church explains, &quot;According to the definition of the Council of Nicaea in 325, Pascha is celebrated on the first Sunday after the full moon following the vernal equinox, but always after the Jewish Passover. The date of the vernal equinox was then defined as March 21.&quot; L&#x27;Huillier notes the success of this strategy - Orthodox Easter has never preceded Passover.

=== Resolution of the Melitian schism ===
The suppression of the Melitian schism, an early breakaway sect, was another important matter that came before the Council of Nicaea. Melitius, it was decided, should remain in his own city of Lycopolis in Egypt but without exercising authority or the power to ordain new clergy; he was forbidden to go into the environs of the town or to enter another diocese for the purpose of ordaining its subjects. Melitius retained his episcopal title, but the ecclesiastics ordained by him were to receive again the laying on of hands, the ordinations performed by Melitius being therefore regarded as invalid. Clergy ordained by Melitius were ordered to yield precedence to those ordained by Alexander, and they were not to do anything without the consent of Bishop Alexander.

In the event of the death of a non-Melitian bishop or ecclesiastic, the vacant see might be given to a Melitian, provided he was worthy and the popular election were ratified by Alexander. Melitius&#x27; episcopal rights and prerogatives were taken from him. These mild measures, however, were in vain; the Melitians joined the Arians and caused more dissension than ever, being among the worst enemies of Athanasius.

=== Promulgation of canon law ===

The Council promulgated twenty new church laws, called &quot;canons&quot; (though the exact number is subject to debate), that is, rules of discipline. The twenty as listed in the works of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers are as follows:

# prohibition of self-castration for clergy
# establishment of a minimum term for catechumens (persons studying for baptism)
# prohibition of a man and a woman who have both taken vows of chastity to live together in a chaste and non-legalized partnership (the so-called &quot;virgines subintroductae&quot;, who practiced syneisaktism)
# ordination of a bishop in the presence of at least three provincial bishops and confirmation by the metropolitan bishop
# provision for two provincial synods to be held annually
# confirmation of ancient customs giving jurisdiction over large regions to the bishops of Alexandria, Rome, and Antioch
# recognition of the honorary rights of the see of Jerusalem
# provision for agreement with the Novatianists, an early sect
# elders who had been ordained without sufficient examination were not to be recognized
# elders who had lapsed but had not been found out were to be deposed
# mercy was enjoined toward those who had lapsed without compulsion, even though it was recognized that they did not deserve it
# those who had left the military but later sought out to be restored to their military position were to be excommunicated; depending on the sincerity of their repentance, they could be readmitted to communion earlier
# those who were fulfilling penance could receive communion if they were dying, but if they got well again, they were to finish their penance
# catechumens who lapsed were to have three years as hearers before being allowed to become catechumens again
# bishops, presbyters, and deacons were not to wander into neighboring cities to officiate
# clergy who refused to return to their home church were to be excommunicated, and the ordinations of those who were ordained by these wandering clergy were to be considered null and void
# prohibition of usury among the clergy
# precedence of bishops and presbyters before deacons in receiving the Eucharist (Holy Communion)
# declaration of the invalidity of baptism by Paulian heretics
# prohibition of kneeling on Sundays and during the Pentecost (the fifty days commencing on Easter). Standing was the normative posture for prayer at this time, as it still is among the Eastern Christians. Kneeling was considered most appropriate to penitential prayer, as distinct from the festive nature of Eastertide and its remembrance every Sunday. The canon was designed only to ensure uniformity of practice at the designated times.

== Effects ==

In the short-term, the Council did not completely solve the problems it was convened to discuss, and a period of conflict and upheaval continued for some time. Constantine was succeeded by two Arian emperors in the Eastern Empire: his son, Constantius II, and Valens. Valens could not resolve the outstanding ecclesiastical issues and unsuccessfully confronted St. Basil over the Nicene Creed.

Pagan powers within the empire sought to maintain and at times re-establish paganism into the seat of the emperor (see Arbogast and Julian the Apostate). Arians and Meletians soon regained nearly all of the rights they had lost, and consequently Arianism continued to spread and be a subject of debate within the Church during the remainder of the 4th century. Almost immediately, Eusebius of Nicomedia, an Arian bishop and cousin to Constantine I, used his influence at court to sway Constantine&#x27;s favor from the proto-orthodox Nicene bishops to the Arians.

Eustathius of Antioch was deposed and exiled in 330. Athanasius, who had succeeded Alexander as Bishop of Alexandria, was deposed by the First Synod of Tyre in 335, and Marcellus of Ancyra followed him in 336. Arius returned to Constantinople to be readmitted into the Church but died shortly before he could be received. Constantine died the next year, after finally receiving baptism from Arian Bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia, and &quot;with his passing the first round in the battle after the Council of Nicaea was ended&quot;.

== Role of Constantine ==

Christianity had only recently been legalised in the empire, the Diocletianic Persecution having ended in 311 under Galerius. Although Galerius stopped the Persecution, Christianity was not legally protected until 313, when the emperors Constantine and Licinius agreed to what became known as the Edict of Milan, guaranteeing Christians legal protection and tolerance. However, Nicene Christianity did not become the state religion of the Roman Empire until the Edict of Thessalonica in 380. In the meantime, paganism remained legal and present in public affairs. Constantine&#x27;s coinage and other official motifs, until the Council of Nicaea, had affiliated him with the pagan cult of Sol Invictus. At first, Constantine encouraged the construction of new temples and tolerated traditional sacrifices. Later in his reign, he gave orders for the pillaging and the tearing down of Roman temples.

Constantine&#x27;s role regarding Nicaea was that of supreme civil leader and authority in the empire. As Emperor, the responsibility for maintaining civil order was his, and he sought that the Church be of one mind and at peace. When first informed of the unrest in Alexandria due to the Arian disputes, he was &quot;greatly troubled&quot; and, &quot;rebuked&quot; both Arius and Bishop Alexander for originating the disturbance and allowing it to become public. Aware also of &quot;the diversity of opinion&quot; regarding the celebration of Easter and hoping to settle both issues, he sent the &quot;honored&quot; Bishop Hosius of Cordova (Hispania) to form a local church council and &quot;reconcile those who were divided&quot;. When that embassy failed, he turned to summoning a synod at Nicaea, inviting &quot;the most eminent men of the churches in every country&quot;.

Constantine assisted in assembling the council by arranging that travel expenses to and from the bishops&#x27; episcopal sees, as well as lodging at Nicaea, be covered out of public funds. He also provided and furnished a &quot;great hall ... in the palace&quot; as a place for discussion so that his guests &quot;should be treated with becoming dignity&quot;. In addressing the opening of the council, he &quot;exhorted the Bishops to unanimity and concord&quot; and called on them to follow the Holy Scriptures with: &quot;Let, then, all contentious disputation be discarded; and let us seek in the divinely-inspired word the solution of the questions at issue.&quot;

Thereupon, the debate about Arius and church doctrine began. &quot;The emperor gave patient attention to the speeches of both parties&quot; and &quot;deferred&quot; to the decision of the bishops. The bishops first pronounced Arius&#x27; teachings to be anathema, formulating the creed as a statement of correct doctrine. When Arius and two followers refused to agree, the bishops pronounced clerical judgement by excommunicating them from the Church. Respecting the clerical decision, and seeing the threat of continued unrest, Constantine also pronounced civil judgement, banishing them into exile. This was the beginning of the practice of using secular power to establish doctrinal orthodoxy within Christianity, an example followed by all later Christian emperors, which led to a circle of Christian violence, and of Christian resistance couched in terms of martyrdom.

== Misconceptions ==

=== Biblical canon ===
There is no record of any discussion of the biblical canon at the council. The development of the biblical canon was nearly complete (with exceptions known as the Antilegomena, written texts whose authenticity or value is disputed) by the time the Muratorian fragment was written. The main source of the idea that the canon was created at the Council of Nicaea seems to be Voltaire, who popularised a story that the canon was determined by placing all the competing books on an altar during the council and then keeping the ones that did not fall off. The original source of this &quot;fictitious anecdote&quot; is the &quot;Synodicon Vetus&quot;, a pseudo-historical account of early Church councils from 887.

In 331, Constantine commissioned fifty Bibles for the use of the Bishop of Constantinople, but little else is known (in fact, it is not even certain whether his request was for fifty copies of the entire Old and New Testaments, only the New Testament, or merely the Gospels). Some scholars believe that this request provided motivation for canon lists. In Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Prologue to Judith&quot;, he claims that the Book of Judith was &quot;found by the Nicene Council to have been counted among the number of the Sacred Scriptures&quot;. However, modern scholars such as Edmon Gallagher have doubted that this indicates any canon selection in the council.

=== Trinity ===
The Council of Nicaea dealt primarily with the issue of the deity of Christ. The term &quot;Trinity&quot; was already in use, with the earliest existing reference being by Theophilus of Antioch (AD 115–181), referring to Theos, the Logos, and Sophia (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as the Holy Spirit was referred to by several Church fathers), though many scholars believe that the way the term was used indicates that it was known previously to his readers. Also, over a century before, the term &quot;Trinity&quot; ( in Greek; in Latin) was used in the writings of Origen and Tertullian, and a general notion of a &quot;divine three&quot;, in some sense, was expressed in the 2nd-century writings of Polycarp, Ignatius, and Justin Martyr. In Nicaea, questions regarding the Holy Spirit were left largely unaddressed until after the relationship between the Father and the Son was settled around the year 362. The doctrine in a more full-fledged form was not formulated until the Council of Constantinople in 381 and a final form formulated primarily by Gregory of Nyssa.

=== Constantine ===
While Constantine had sought a unified church after the council, he did not force the homoousian view of Christ&#x27;s nature on the council. Constantine did not commission any Bibles at the council. Despite Constantine&#x27;s sympathetic interest in the Church, he was not baptized until some 11 or 12 years after the council, putting off baptism as long as he did so as to be absolved from as much sin as possible.

== Disputed matters ==
According to Protestant theologian Philip Schaff: &quot;The Nicene fathers passed this canon not as introducing anything new, but merely as confirming an existing relation on the basis of church tradition; and that, with special reference to Alexandria, on account of the troubles existing there. Rome was named only for illustration; and Antioch and all the other eparchies or provinces were secured their admitted rights. The bishoprics of Alexandria, Rome, and Antioch were placed substantially on equal footing.&quot; Thus, according to Schaff, the Bishop of Alexandria was to have jurisdiction over the provinces of Egypt, Libya and the Pentapolis, just as the Bishop of Rome had authority &quot;with reference to his own diocese.&quot;

However, according to Fr. James F. Loughlin, there is an alternative Catholic interpretation. It involves five different arguments &quot;drawn respectively from the grammatical structure of the sentence, from the logical sequence of ideas, from Catholic analogy, from comparison with the process of formation of the Byzantine Patriarchate, and from the authority of the ancients&quot; in favor of an alternative understanding of the canon. According to this interpretation, the canon shows the role the Bishop of Rome had when he, by his authority, confirmed the jurisdiction of the other patriarchs—an interpretation which is in line with the Catholic understanding of the Pope. Thus, the Bishop of Alexandria presided over Egypt, Libya and the Pentapolis, while the Bishop of Antioch &quot;enjoyed a similar authority throughout the great diocese of Oriens,&quot; and all by the authority of the Bishop of Rome. To Loughlin, that was the only possible reason to invoke the custom of a Roman Bishop in a matter related to the two metropolitan bishops in Alexandria and Antioch.

However, Protestant and Catholic interpretations have historically assumed that some or all of the bishops identified in the canon were presiding over their own dioceses at the time of the Council—the Bishop of Rome over the Diocese of Italy, as Schaff suggested, the Bishop of Antioch over the Diocese of Oriens, as Loughlin suggested, and the Bishop of Alexandria over the Diocese of Egypt, as suggested by Karl Josef von Hefele. According to Hefele, the council had assigned to Alexandria, &quot;the whole (civil) Diocese of Egypt.&quot; Yet those assumptions have since been proven false. At the time of the council, the Diocese of Egypt did exist but was known as the Diocese of Alexandria, so the council could have assigned it to Alexandria. Antioch and Alexandria were both located within the civil Diocese of Oriens, Antioch being the chief metropolis, but neither administered the whole. Likewise, Rome and Milan were both located within the civil Diocese of Italy, Milan being the chief metropolis.

This geographic issue related to Canon 6 was highlighted by Protestant writer Timothy F. Kauffman, as a correction to the anachronism created by the assumption that each bishop was already presiding over a whole diocese at the time of the council. According to Kauffman, since Milan and Rome were both located within the Diocese of Italy, and Antioch and Alexandria were both located within the Diocese of Oriens, a relevant and &quot;structural congruency&quot; between Rome and Alexandria was readily apparent to the gathered bishops: both had been made to share a diocese of which neither was the chief metropolis. Rome&#x27;s jurisdiction within Italy had been defined in terms of several of the city&#x27;s adjacent provinces since Diocletian&#x27;s reordering of the empire in 293, as the earliest Latin version of the canon indicates.

That provincial arrangement of Roman and Milanese jurisdiction within Italy therefore was a relevant precedent, and provided an administrative solution to the problem facing the Council—namely, how to define Alexandrian and Antiochian jurisdiction within the Diocese of Oriens. In canon 6, the Council left most of the diocese under Antioch&#x27;s jurisdiction, and assigned a few provinces of the diocese to Alexandria, &quot;since the like is customary for the Bishop of Rome also.&quot;
