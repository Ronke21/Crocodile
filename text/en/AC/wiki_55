<text>Glucose is a sugar with the molecular formula , which is often abbreviated as Glc. It is overall the most abundant monosaccharide, a subcategory of carbohydrates. It is mainly made by plants and most algae during photosynthesis from water and carbon dioxide, using energy from sunlight. It is used by plants to make cellulose, the most abundant carbohydrate in the world, for use in cell walls, and by all living organisms to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used by the cell as energy.

In energy metabolism, glucose is the most important source of energy in all organisms. Glucose for metabolism is stored as a polymer, in plants mainly as amylose and amylopectin, and in animals as glycogen. Glucose circulates in the blood of animals as blood sugar. The naturally occurring form is -glucose, while its stereoisomer -glucose is produced synthetically in comparatively small amounts and is less biologically active. Glucose is a monosaccharide containing six carbon atoms and an aldehyde group, and is therefore an aldohexose. The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) as well as ring (cyclic) form. Glucose is naturally occurring and is found in its free state in fruits and other parts of plants. In animals, it is released from the breakdown of glycogen in a process known as glycogenolysis.

Glucose, as intravenous sugar solution, is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is also on the list in combination with sodium chloride (table salt).

The name glucose is derived from Ancient Greek () &#x27;wine, must&#x27;, from () &#x27;sweet&#x27;. The suffix &quot;-ose&quot; is a chemical classifier denoting a sugar.

==History==
Glucose was first isolated from raisins in 1747 by the German chemist Andreas Marggraf. Glucose was discovered in grapes by another German chemistJohann Tobias Lowitzin 1792, and distinguished as being different from cane sugar (sucrose). Glucose is the term coined by Jean Baptiste Dumas in 1838, which has prevailed in the chemical literature. Friedrich August Kekulé proposed the term dextrose (from the Latin , meaning &quot;right&quot;), because in aqueous solution of glucose, the plane of linearly polarized light is turned to the right. In contrast, l-fructose (usually referred to as -fructose) (a ketohexose) and l-glucose (-glucose) turn linearly polarized light to the left. The earlier notation according to the rotation of the plane of linearly polarized light (&quot;d&quot; and &quot;l&quot;-nomenclature) was later abandoned in favor of the - and -notation, which refers to the absolute configuration of the asymmetric center farthest from the carbonyl group, and in concordance with the configuration of - or -glyceraldehyde.

Since glucose is a basic necessity of many organisms, a correct understanding of its chemical makeup and structure contributed greatly to a general advancement in organic chemistry. This understanding occurred largely as a result of the investigations of Emil Fischer, a German chemist who received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his findings. The synthesis of glucose established the structure of organic material and consequently formed the first definitive validation of Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff&#x27;s theories of chemical kinetics and the arrangements of chemical bonds in carbon-bearing molecules. Between 1891 and 1894, Fischer established the stereochemical configuration of all the known sugars and correctly predicted the possible isomers, applying Van &#x27;t Hoff equation of asymmetrical carbon atoms. The names initially referred to the natural substances. Their enantiomers were given the same name with the introduction of systematic nomenclatures, taking into account absolute stereochemistry (e.g. Fischer nomenclature, / nomenclature).

For the discovery of the metabolism of glucose Otto Meyerhof received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1922. Hans von Euler-Chelpin was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Arthur Harden in 1929 for their &quot;research on the fermentation of sugar and their share of enzymes in this process&quot;. In 1947, Bernardo Houssay (for his discovery of the role of the pituitary gland in the metabolism of glucose and the derived carbohydrates) as well as Carl and Gerty Cori (for their discovery of the conversion of glycogen from glucose) received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. In 1970, Luis Leloir was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of glucose-derived sugar nucleotides in the biosynthesis of carbohydrates.

== Chemical and physical properties ==
Glucose forms white or colorless solids that are highly soluble in water and acetic acid but poorly soluble in methanol and ethanol. They melt at (&quot;α&quot;) and (&quot;beta&quot;), decompose starting at with release of various volatile products, ultimately leaving a residue of carbon. Glucose has a pKa value of 12.16 at in water.

With six carbon atoms, it is classed as a hexose, a subcategory of the monosaccharides. -Glucose is one of the sixteen aldohexose stereoisomers. The -isomer, -glucose, also known as dextrose, occurs widely in nature, but the -isomer, -glucose, does not. Glucose can be obtained by hydrolysis of carbohydrates such as milk sugar (lactose), cane sugar (sucrose), maltose, cellulose, glycogen, etc. Dextrose is commonly commercially manufactured from starches, such as corn starch in the US and Japan, from potato and wheat starch in Europe, and from tapioca starch in tropical areas. The manufacturing process uses hydrolysis via pressurized steaming at controlled pH in a jet followed by further enzymatic depolymerization. Unbonded glucose is one of the main ingredients of honey.

The term &quot;dextrose&quot; is often used in a clinical (related to patient&#x27;s health status) or nutritional context (related to dietary intake, such as food labels or dietary guidelines), while &quot;glucose&quot; is used in a biological or physiological context (chemical processes and molecular interactions), but both terms refer to the same molecule, specifically D-glucose. 

&quot;Dextrose monohydrate&quot; is the hydrated form of D-glucose, meaning that it is a glucose molecule with an additional water molecule attached. Its chemical formula is  · . Dextrose monohydrate is also called &quot;hydrated D-glucose&quot;, and commonly manufactured from plant starches. Dextrose monohydrate is utilized as the predominant type of dextrose in food applications, such as beverage mixes—it is a common form of glucose widely used as a nutrition supplement in production of foodstuffs. Dextrose monohydrate is primarily consumed in North America as a corn syrup or high-fructose corn syrup.

&quot;Anhydrous dextrose&quot;, on the other hand, is glucose that does not have any water molecules attached to it. Anhydrous chemical substances are commonly produced by eliminating water from a hydrated substance through methods such as heating or drying up (desiccation). Dextrose monohydrate can be dehydrated to anhydrous dextrose in industrial setting. Dextrose monohydrate is composed of approximately 9.5% water by mass; through the process of dehydration, this water content is eliminated to yield anhydrous (dry) dextrose.

Anhydrous dextrose has the chemical formula , without any water molecule attached which is the same as glucose. Anhydrous dextrose on open air tends to absorb moisture and transform to the monohydrate, and it is more expensive to produce. Anhydrous dextrose (anhydrous D-glucose) has increased stability and increased shelf life, has medical applications, such as in oral glucose tolerance test.

Whereas molecular weight (molar mass) for D-glucose monohydrate is 198.17 g/mol, that for anhydrous D-glucose is 180.16 g/mol The density of these two forms of glucose is also different.

In terms of chemical structure, glucose is a monosaccharide, that is, a simple sugar. Glucose contains six carbon atoms and an aldehyde group, and is therefore an aldohexose. The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) as well as ring (cyclic) form—due to the presence of alcohol and aldehyde or ketone functional groups, the form having the straight chain can easily convert into a chair-like hemiacetal ring structure commonly found in carbohydrates.

===Structure and nomenclature===
Glucose is present in solid form as a monohydrate with a closed pyran ring (α-D-glucopyranose monohydrate, sometimes known less precisely by dextrose hydrate). In aqueous solution, on the other hand, it is an open-chain to a small extent and is present predominantly as α- or β-pyranose, which interconvert. From aqueous solutions, the three known forms can be crystallized: α-glucopyranose, β-glucopyranose and α-glucopyranose monohydrate. Glucose is a building block of the disaccharides lactose and sucrose (cane or beet sugar), of oligosaccharides such as raffinose and of polysaccharides such as starch, amylopectin, glycogen, and cellulose. The glass transition temperature of glucose is and the Gordon–Taylor constant (an experimentally determined constant for the prediction of the glass transition temperature for different mass fractions of a mixture of two substances) is 4.5.

===Open-chain form===

A open-chain form of glucose makes up less than 0.02% of the glucose molecules in an aqueous solution at equilibrium. The rest is one of two cyclic hemiacetal forms. In its open-chain form, the glucose molecule has an open (as opposed to cyclic) unbranched backbone of six carbon atoms, where C-1 is part of an aldehyde group . Therefore, glucose is also classified as an aldose, or an aldohexose. The aldehyde group makes glucose a reducing sugar giving a positive reaction with the Fehling test.

===Cyclic forms===

In solutions, the open-chain form of glucose (either &quot;-&quot; or &quot;-&quot;) exists in equilibrium with several cyclic isomers, each containing a ring of carbons closed by one oxygen atom. In aqueous solution, however, more than 99% of glucose molecules exist as pyranose forms. The open-chain form is limited to about 0.25%, and furanose forms exist in negligible amounts. The terms &quot;glucose&quot; and &quot;-glucose&quot; are generally used for these cyclic forms as well. The ring arises from the open-chain form by an intramolecular nucleophilic addition reaction between the aldehyde group (at C-1) and either the C-4 or C-5 hydroxyl group, forming a hemiacetal linkage, .

The reaction between C-1 and C-5 yields a six-membered heterocyclic system called a pyranose, which is a monosaccharide sugar (hence &quot;-ose&quot;) containing a derivatised pyran skeleton. The (much rarer) reaction between C-1 and C-4 yields a five-membered furanose ring, named after the cyclic ether furan. In either case, each carbon in the ring has one hydrogen and one hydroxyl attached, except for the last carbon (C-4 or C-5) where the hydroxyl is replaced by the remainder of the open molecule (which is or respectively).

The ring-closing reaction can give two products, denoted &quot;α-&quot; and &quot;β-&quot;. When a glucopyranose molecule is drawn in the Haworth projection, the designation &quot;α-&quot; means that the hydroxyl group attached to C-1 and the group at C-5 lies on opposite sides of the ring&#x27;s plane (a&quot; trans&quot; arrangement), while &quot;β-&quot; means that they are on the same side of the plane (a&quot; cis&quot; arrangement). Therefore, the open-chain isomer -glucose gives rise to four distinct cyclic isomers: α--glucopyranose, β--glucopyranose, α--glucofuranose, and β--glucofuranose. These five structures exist in equilibrium and interconvert, and the interconversion is much more rapid with acid catalysis.


The other open-chain isomer -glucose similarly gives rise to four distinct cyclic forms of -glucose, each the mirror image of the corresponding -glucose.

The glucopyranose ring (α or β) can assume several non-planar shapes, analogous to the &quot;chair&quot; and &quot;boat&quot; conformations of cyclohexane. Similarly, the glucofuranose ring may assume several shapes, analogous to the &quot;envelope&quot; conformations of cyclopentane.

In the solid state, only the glucopyranose forms are observed.

Some derivatives of glucofuranose, such as 1,2-&quot;O&quot;-isopropylidene--glucofuranose are stable and can be obtained pure as crystalline solids. For example, reaction of α-D-glucose with &quot;para&quot;-tolylboronic acid reforms the normal pyranose ring to yield the 4-fold ester α-D-glucofuranose-1,2:3,5-bis(&quot;p&quot;-tolylboronate).

===Mutarotation===
Mutarotation consists of a temporary reversal of the ring-forming reaction, resulting in the open-chain form, followed by a reforming of the ring. The ring closure step may use a different group than the one recreated by the opening step (thus switching between pyranose and furanose forms), or the new hemiacetal group created on C-1 may have the same or opposite handedness as the original one (thus switching between the α and β forms). Thus, though the open-chain form is barely detectable in solution, it is an essential component of the equilibrium.

The open-chain form is thermodynamically unstable, and it spontaneously isomerizes to the cyclic forms. (Although the ring closure reaction could in theory create four- or three-atom rings, these would be highly strained, and are not observed in practice.) In solutions at room temperature, the four cyclic isomers interconvert over a time scale of hours, in a process called mutarotation. Starting from any proportions, the mixture converges to a stable ratio of α:β 36:64. The ratio would be α:β 11:89 if it were not for the influence of the anomeric effect. Mutarotation is considerably slower at temperatures close to .

===Optical activity===
Whether in water or the solid form, -(+)-glucose is dextrorotatory, meaning it will rotate the direction of polarized light clockwise as seen looking toward the light source. The effect is due to the chirality of the molecules, and indeed the mirror-image isomer, -(−)-glucose, is levorotatory (rotates polarized light counterclockwise) by the same amount. The strength of the effect is different for each of the five tautomers.

The - prefix does not refer directly to the optical properties of the compound. It indicates that the C-5 chiral centre has the same handedness as that of -glyceraldehyde (which was so labelled because it is dextrorotatory). The fact that -glucose is dextrorotatory is a combined effect of its four chiral centres, not just of C-5; some of the other -aldohexoses are levorotatory.

The conversion between the two anomers can be observed in a polarimeter since pure α--glucose has a specific rotation angle of +112.2° mL/(dm·g), pure β--glucose of +17.5° mL/(dm·g). When equilibrium has been reached after a certain time due to mutarotation, the angle of rotation is +52.7° mL/(dm·g). By adding acid or base, this transformation is much accelerated. The equilibration takes place via the open-chain aldehyde form.

===Isomerisation===
In dilute sodium hydroxide or other dilute bases, the monosaccharides mannose, glucose and fructose interconvert (via a Lobry de Bruyn–Alberda–Van Ekenstein transformation), so that a balance between these isomers is formed. This reaction proceeds via an enediol:

==Biochemical properties==

Glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide. Glucose is also the most widely used aldohexose in most living organisms. One possible explanation for this is that glucose has a lower tendency than other aldohexoses to react nonspecifically with the amine groups of proteins. This reaction—glycation—impairs or destroys the function of many proteins, e.g. in glycated hemoglobin. Glucose&#x27;s low rate of glycation can be attributed to its having a more stable cyclic form compared to other aldohexoses, which means it spends less time than they do in its reactive open-chain form. The reason for glucose having the most stable cyclic form of all the aldohexoses is that its hydroxy groups (with the exception of the hydroxy group on the anomeric carbon of -glucose) are in the equatorial position. Presumably, glucose is the most abundant natural monosaccharide because it is less glycated with proteins than other monosaccharides. Another hypothesis is that glucose, being the only -aldohexose that has all five hydroxy substituents in the equatorial position in the form of β--glucose, is more readily accessible to chemical reactions, for example, for esterification or acetal formation. For this reason, -glucose is also a highly preferred building block in natural polysaccharides (glycans). Polysaccharides that are composed solely of glucose are termed glucans.

Glucose is produced by plants through photosynthesis using sunlight, water and carbon dioxide and can be used by all living organisms as an energy and carbon source. However, most glucose does not occur in its free form, but in the form of its polymers, i.e. lactose, sucrose, starch and others which are energy reserve substances, and cellulose and chitin, which are components of the cell wall in plants or fungi and arthropods, respectively. These polymers, when consumed by animals, fungi and bacteria, are degraded to glucose using enzymes. All animals are also able to produce glucose themselves from certain precursors as the need arises. Neurons, cells of the renal medulla and erythrocytes depend on glucose for their energy production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Löffler/Petrides 195&quot;&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: &quot;Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie&quot; .. Springer-Verlag, 2014, , p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; In adult humans, there is about of glucose, of which about is present in the blood. Approximately of glucose is produced in the liver of an adult in 24 hours.

Many of the long-term complications of diabetes (e.g., blindness, kidney failure, and peripheral neuropathy) are probably due to the glycation of proteins or lipids. In contrast, enzyme-regulated addition of sugars to protein is called glycosylation and is essential for the function of many proteins.

===Uptake===
Ingested glucose initially binds to the receptor for sweet taste on the tongue in humans. This complex of the proteins T1R2 and T1R3 makes it possible to identify glucose-containing food sources. Glucose mainly comes from food—about per day is produced by conversion of food,&lt;ref name=&quot;Löffler/Petrides 404&quot;&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: &quot;Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie&quot;. Springer-Verlag, 2014, , p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is also synthesized from other metabolites in the body&#x27;s cells. In humans, the breakdown of glucose-containing polysaccharides happens in part already during chewing by means of amylase, which is contained in saliva, as well as by maltase, lactase, and sucrase on the brush border of the small intestine. Glucose is a building block of many carbohydrates and can be split off from them using certain enzymes. Glucosidases, a subgroup of the glycosidases, first catalyze the hydrolysis of long-chain glucose-containing polysaccharides, removing terminal glucose. In turn, disaccharides are mostly degraded by specific glycosidases to glucose. The names of the degrading enzymes are often derived from the particular poly- and disaccharide; inter alia, for the degradation of polysaccharide chains there are amylases (named after amylose, a component of starch), cellulases (named after cellulose), chitinases (named after chitin), and more. Furthermore, for the cleavage of disaccharides, there are maltase, lactase, sucrase, trehalase, and others. In humans, about 70 genes are known that code for glycosidases. They have functions in the digestion and degradation of glycogen, sphingolipids, mucopolysaccharides, and poly(ADP-ribose). Humans do not produce cellulases, chitinases, or trehalases, but the bacteria in the gut microbiota do.

In order to get into or out of cell membranes of cells and membranes of cell compartments, glucose requires special transport proteins from the major facilitator superfamily. In the small intestine (more precisely, in the jejunum), glucose is taken up into the intestinal epithelium with the help of glucose transporters via a secondary active transport mechanism called sodium ion-glucose symport via sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1). Further transfer occurs on the basolateral side of the intestinal epithelial cells via the glucose transporter GLUT2, as well uptake into liver cells, kidney cells, cells of the islets of Langerhans, neurons, astrocytes, and tanycytes. Glucose enters the liver via the portal vein and is stored there as a cellular glycogen. In the liver cell, it is phosphorylated by glucokinase at position 6 to form glucose 6-phosphate, which cannot leave the cell. Glucose 6-phosphatase can convert glucose 6-phosphate back into glucose exclusively in the liver, so the body can maintain a sufficient blood glucose concentration. In other cells, uptake happens by passive transport through one of the 14 GLUT proteins. In the other cell types, phosphorylation occurs through a hexokinase, whereupon glucose can no longer diffuse out of the cell.

The glucose transporter GLUT1 is produced by most cell types and is of particular importance for nerve cells and pancreatic β-cells. GLUT3 is highly expressed in nerve cells. Glucose from the bloodstream is taken up by GLUT4 from muscle cells (of the skeletal muscle and heart muscle) and fat cells. GLUT14 is expressed exclusively in testicles. Excess glucose is broken down and converted into fatty acids, which are stored as triglycerides. In the kidneys, glucose in the urine is absorbed via SGLT1 and SGLT2 in the apical cell membranes and transmitted via GLUT2 in the basolateral cell membranes. About 90% of kidney glucose reabsorption is via SGLT2 and about 3% via SGLT1.

===Biosynthesis===

In plants and some prokaryotes, glucose is a product of photosynthesis. Glucose is also formed by the breakdown of polymeric forms of glucose like glycogen (in animals and mushrooms) or starch (in plants). The cleavage of glycogen is termed glycogenolysis, the cleavage of starch is called starch degradation.

The metabolic pathway that begins with molecules containing two to four carbon atoms (C) and ends in the glucose molecule containing six carbon atoms is called gluconeogenesis and occurs in all living organisms. The smaller starting materials are the result of other metabolic pathways. Ultimately almost all biomolecules come from the assimilation of carbon dioxide in plants and microbes during photosynthesis. The free energy of formation of α--glucose is 917.2 kilojoules per mole. In humans, gluconeogenesis occurs in the liver and kidney, but also in other cell types. In the liver about of glycogen are stored, in skeletal muscle about .&lt;ref name=&quot;Löffler/Petrides 389&quot;&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: &quot;Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie&quot; . Springer-Verlag, 2014, , p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the glucose released in muscle cells upon cleavage of the glycogen can not be delivered to the circulation because glucose is phosphorylated by the hexokinase, and a glucose-6-phosphatase is not expressed to remove the phosphate group. Unlike for glucose, there is no transport protein for glucose-6-phosphate. Gluconeogenesis allows the organism to build up glucose from other metabolites, including lactate or certain amino acids, while consuming energy. The renal tubular cells can also produce glucose.

Glucose also can be found outside of living organisms in the ambient environment. Glucose concentrations in the atmosphere are detected via collection of samples by aircraft and are known to vary from location to location. For example, glucose concentrations in atmospheric air from inland China range from 0.8 to 20.1 pg/L, whereas east coastal China glucose concentrations range from 10.3 to 142 pg/L.

===Glucose degradation===

In humans, glucose is metabolized by glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Glycolysis is used by all living organisms, with small variations, and all organisms generate energy from the breakdown of monosaccharides. In the further course of the metabolism, it can be completely degraded via oxidative decarboxylation, the citric acid cycle (synonym &quot;Krebs cycle&quot;) and the respiratory chain to water and carbon dioxide. If there is not enough oxygen available for this, the glucose degradation in animals occurs anaerobic to lactate via lactic acid fermentation and releases much less energy. Muscular lactate enters the liver through the bloodstream in mammals, where gluconeogenesis occurs (Cori cycle). With a high supply of glucose, the metabolite acetyl-CoA from the Krebs cycle can also be used for fatty acid synthesis. Glucose is also used to replenish the body&#x27;s glycogen stores, which are mainly found in liver and skeletal muscle. These processes are hormonally regulated.

In other living organisms, other forms of fermentation can occur. The bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; can grow on nutrient media containing glucose as the sole carbon source. In some bacteria and, in modified form, also in archaea, glucose is degraded via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. With Glucose, a mechanism for gene regulation was discovered in &quot;E. coli&quot;, the catabolite repression (formerly known as &quot;glucose effect&quot;).

Use of glucose as an energy source in cells is by either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, or fermentation. The first step of glycolysis is the phosphorylation of glucose by a hexokinase to form glucose 6-phosphate. The main reason for the immediate phosphorylation of glucose is to prevent its diffusion out of the cell as the charged phosphate group prevents glucose 6-phosphate from easily crossing the cell membrane. Furthermore, addition of the high-energy phosphate group activates glucose for subsequent breakdown in later steps of glycolysis.

In anaerobic respiration, one glucose molecule produces a net gain of two ATP molecules (four ATP molecules are produced during glycolysis through substrate-level phosphorylation, but two are required by enzymes used during the process). In aerobic respiration, a molecule of glucose is much more profitable in that a maximum net production of 30 or 32 ATP molecules (depending on the organism) is generated.

Tumor cells often grow comparatively quickly and consume an above-average amount of glucose by glycolysis, which leads to the formation of lactate, the end product of fermentation in mammals, even in the presence of oxygen. This is called the Warburg effect. For the increased uptake of glucose in tumors various SGLT and GLUT are overly produced.

In yeast, ethanol is fermented at high glucose concentrations, even in the presence of oxygen (which normally leads to respiration rather than fermentation). This is called the Crabtree effect.

Glucose can also degrade to form carbon dioxide through abiotic means. This has been demonstrated to occur experimentally via oxidation and hydrolysis at 22 °C and a pH of 2.5.

===Energy source===

Glucose is a ubiquitous fuel in biology. It is used as an energy source in organisms, from bacteria to humans, through either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration (in bacteria), or fermentation. Glucose is the human body&#x27;s key source of energy, through aerobic respiration, providing about 3.75 kilocalories (16 kilojoules) of food energy per gram. Breakdown of carbohydrates (e.g., starch) yields mono- and disaccharides, most of which is glucose. Through glycolysis and later in the reactions of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, glucose is oxidized to eventually form carbon dioxide and water, yielding energy mostly in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The insulin reaction, and other mechanisms, regulate the concentration of glucose in the blood. The physiological caloric value of glucose, depending on the source, is 16.2 kilojoules per gram or 15.7 kJ/g (3.74 kcal/g). The high availability of carbohydrates from plant biomass has led to a variety of methods during evolution, especially in microorganisms, to utilize glucose for energy and carbon storage. Differences exist in which end product can no longer be used for energy production. The presence of individual genes, and their gene products, the enzymes, determine which reactions are possible. The metabolic pathway of glycolysis is used by almost all living beings. An essential difference in the use of glycolysis is the recovery of NADPH as a reductant for anabolism that would otherwise have to be generated indirectly.

Glucose and oxygen supply almost all the energy for the brain, so its availability influences psychological processes. When glucose is low, psychological processes requiring mental effort (e.g., self-control, effortful decision-making) are impaired. In the brain, which is dependent on glucose and oxygen as the major source of energy, the glucose concentration is usually 4 to 6 mM (5 mM equals 90 mg/dL), but decreases to 2 to 3 mM when fasting. Confusion occurs below 1 mM and coma at lower levels.

The glucose in the blood is called blood sugar. Blood sugar levels are regulated by glucose-binding nerve cells in the hypothalamus. In addition, glucose in the brain binds to glucose receptors of the reward system in the nucleus accumbens. The binding of glucose to the sweet receptor on the tongue induces a release of various hormones of energy metabolism, either through glucose or through other sugars, leading to an increased cellular uptake and lower blood sugar levels. Artificial sweeteners do not lower blood sugar levels.

The blood sugar content of a healthy person in the short-time fasting state, e.g. after overnight fasting, is about 70 to 100 mg/dL of blood (4 to 5.5 mM). In blood plasma, the measured values are about 10–15% higher. In addition, the values in the arterial blood are higher than the concentrations in the venous blood since glucose is absorbed into the tissue during the passage of the capillary bed. Also in the capillary blood, which is often used for blood sugar determination, the values are sometimes higher than in the venous blood. The glucose content of the blood is regulated by the hormones insulin, incretin and glucagon. Insulin lowers the glucose level, glucagon increases it. Furthermore, the hormones adrenaline, thyroxine, glucocorticoids, somatotropin and adrenocorticotropin lead to an increase in the glucose level. There is also a hormone-independent regulation, which is referred to as glucose autoregulation. After food intake the blood sugar concentration increases. Values over 180 mg/dL in venous whole blood are pathological and are termed hyperglycemia, values below 40 mg/dL are termed hypoglycaemia. When needed, glucose is released into the bloodstream by glucose-6-phosphatase from glucose-6-phosphate originating from liver and kidney glycogen, thereby regulating the homeostasis of blood glucose concentration. In ruminants, the blood glucose concentration is lower (60 mg/dL in cattle and 40 mg/dL in sheep), because the carbohydrates are converted more by their gut microbiota into short-chain fatty acids.

Some glucose is converted to lactic acid by astrocytes, which is then utilized as an energy source by brain cells; some glucose is used by intestinal cells and red blood cells, while the rest reaches the liver, adipose tissue and muscle cells, where it is absorbed and stored as glycogen (under the influence of insulin). Liver cell glycogen can be converted to glucose and returned to the blood when insulin is low or absent; muscle cell glycogen is not returned to the blood because of a lack of enzymes. In fat cells, glucose is used to power reactions that synthesize some fat types and have other purposes. Glycogen is the body&#x27;s &quot;glucose energy storage&quot; mechanism, because it is much more &quot;space efficient&quot; and less reactive than glucose itself.

As a result of its importance in human health, glucose is an analyte in glucose tests that are common medical blood tests. Eating or fasting prior to taking a blood sample has an effect on analyses for glucose in the blood; a high fasting glucose blood sugar level may be a sign of prediabetes or diabetes mellitus.

The glycemic index is an indicator of the speed of resorption and conversion to blood glucose levels from ingested carbohydrates, measured as the area under the curve of blood glucose levels after consumption in comparison to glucose (glucose is defined as 100). The clinical importance of the glycemic index is controversial, as foods with high fat contents slow the resorption of carbohydrates and lower the glycemic index, e.g. ice cream. An alternative indicator is the insulin index, measured as the impact of carbohydrate consumption on the blood insulin levels. The glycemic load is an indicator for the amount of glucose added to blood glucose levels after consumption, based on the glycemic index and the amount of consumed food.

===Precursor===
Organisms use glucose as a precursor for the synthesis of several important substances. Starch, cellulose, and glycogen (&quot;animal starch&quot;) are common glucose polymers (polysaccharides). Some of these polymers (starch or glycogen) serve as energy stores, while others (cellulose and chitin, which is made from a derivative of glucose) have structural roles. Oligosaccharides of glucose combined with other sugars serve as important energy stores. These include lactose, the predominant sugar in milk, which is a glucose-galactose disaccharide, and sucrose, another disaccharide which is composed of glucose and fructose. Glucose is also added onto certain proteins and lipids in a process called glycosylation. This is often critical for their functioning. The enzymes that join glucose to other molecules usually use phosphorylated glucose to power the formation of the new bond by coupling it with the breaking of the glucose-phosphate bond.

Other than its direct use as a monomer, glucose can be broken down to synthesize a wide variety of other biomolecules. This is important, as glucose serves both as a primary store of energy and as a source of organic carbon. Glucose can be broken down and converted into lipids. It is also a precursor for the synthesis of other important molecules such as vitamin C (ascorbic acid). In living organisms, glucose is converted to several other chemical compounds that are the starting material for various metabolic pathways. Among them, all other monosaccharides&lt;ref name=&quot;Löffler/Petrides 27&quot;&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: &quot;Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie&quot; .

Springer-Verlag, 2014, , p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the phosphorylation to glucose-6-phosphate, which is part of the glycolysis, glucose can be oxidized during its degradation to glucono-1,5-lactone. Glucose is used in some bacteria as a building block in the trehalose or the dextran biosynthesis and in animals as a building block of glycogen. Glucose can also be converted from bacterial xylose isomerase to fructose. In addition, glucose metabolites produce all nonessential amino acids, sugar alcohols such as mannitol and sorbitol, fatty acids, cholesterol and nucleic acids. Finally, glucose is used as a building block in the glycosylation of proteins to glycoproteins, glycolipids, peptidoglycans, glycosides and other substances (catalyzed by glycosyltransferases) and can be cleaved from them by glycosidases.

==Pathology==
===Diabetes===
Diabetes is a metabolic disorder where the body is unable to regulate levels of glucose in the blood either because of a lack of insulin in the body or the failure, by cells in the body, to respond properly to insulin. Each of these situations can be caused by persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, through pancreatic burnout and insulin resistance. The pancreas is the organ responsible for the secretion of the hormones insulin and glucagon. Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose levels, allowing the body&#x27;s cells to absorb and use glucose. Without it, glucose cannot enter the cell and therefore cannot be used as fuel for the body&#x27;s functions. If the pancreas is exposed to persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas could be damaged, causing a lack of insulin in the body. Insulin resistance occurs when the pancreas tries to produce more and more insulin in response to persistently elevated blood glucose levels. Eventually, the rest of the body becomes resistant to the insulin that the pancreas is producing, thereby requiring more insulin to achieve the same blood glucose-lowering effect, and forcing the pancreas to produce even more insulin to compete with the resistance. This negative spiral contributes to pancreatic burnout, and the disease progression of diabetes.

To monitor the body&#x27;s response to blood glucose-lowering therapy, glucose levels can be measured. Blood glucose monitoring can be performed by multiple methods, such as the fasting glucose test which measures the level of glucose in the blood after 8 hours of fasting. Another test is the 2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT)for this test, the person has a fasting glucose test done, then drinks a 75-gram glucose drink and is retested. This test measures the ability of the person&#x27;s body to process glucose. Over time the blood glucose levels should decrease as insulin allows it to be taken up by cells and exit the blood stream.

===Hypoglycemia management===

Individuals with diabetes or other conditions that result in low blood sugar often carry small amounts of sugar in various forms. One sugar commonly used is glucose, often in the form of glucose tablets (glucose pressed into a tablet shape sometimes with one or more other ingredients as a binder), hard candy, or sugar packet.

==Sources==
Most dietary carbohydrates contain glucose, either as their only building block (as in the polysaccharides starch and glycogen), or together with another monosaccharide (as in the hetero-polysaccharides sucrose and lactose). Unbound glucose is one of the main ingredients of honey. Glucose is extremely abundant and has been isolated from a variety of natural sources across the world, including male cones of the coniferous tree &quot;Wollemia nobilis&quot; in Rome, the roots of &quot;Ilex asprella&quot; plants in China, and straws from rice in California.


==Commercial production==

Glucose is produced industrially from starch by enzymatic hydrolysis using glucose amylase or by the use of acids. Enzymatic hydrolysis has largely displaced acid-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions. The result is glucose syrup (enzymatically with more than 90% glucose in the dry matter) with an annual worldwide production volume of 20 million tonnes (as of 2011). This is the reason for the former common name &quot;starch sugar&quot;. The amylases most often come from &quot;Bacillus licheniformis&quot; or &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; (strain MN-385), which are more thermostable than the originally used enzymes. Starting in 1982, pullulanases from &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; were used in the production of glucose syrup to convert amylopectin to starch (amylose), thereby increasing the yield of glucose. The reaction is carried out at a pH = 4.6–5.2 and a temperature of 55–60 °C. Corn syrup has between 20% and 95% glucose in the dry matter. The Japanese form of the glucose syrup, Mizuame, is made from sweet potato or rice starch. Maltodextrin contains about 20% glucose.

Many crops can be used as the source of starch. Maize, rice, wheat, cassava, potato, barley, sweet potato, corn husk and sago are all used in various parts of the world. In the United States, corn starch (from maize) is used almost exclusively. Some commercial glucose occurs as a component of invert sugar, a roughly 1:1 mixture of glucose and fructose that is produced from sucrose. In principle, cellulose could be hydrolyzed to glucose, but this process is not yet commercially practical.

===Conversion to fructose===

In the US, almost exclusively corn (more precisely, corn syrup) is used as glucose source for the production of isoglucose, which is a mixture of glucose and fructose, since fructose has a higher sweetening powerwith same physiological calorific value of 374 kilocalories per 100 g. The annual world production of isoglucose is 8 million tonnes (as of 2011). When made from corn syrup, the final product is high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS).

==Commercial usage==

Glucose is mainly used for the production of fructose and of glucose-containing foods. In foods, it is used as a sweetener, humectant, to increase the volume and to create a softer mouthfeel. Various sources of glucose, such as grape juice (for wine) or malt (for beer), are used for fermentation to ethanol during the production of alcoholic beverages. Most soft drinks in the US use HFCS-55 (with a fructose content of 55% in the dry mass), while most other HFCS-sweetened foods in the US use HFCS-42 (with a fructose content of 42% in the dry mass). In Mexico, on the other hand, soft drinks are sweetened by cane sugar, which has a higher sweetening power. In addition, glucose syrup is used, inter alia, in the production of confectionery such as candies, toffee and fondant. Typical chemical reactions of glucose when heated under water-free conditions are caramelization and, in presence of amino acids, the Maillard reaction.

In addition, various organic acids can be biotechnologically produced from glucose, for example by fermentation with &quot;Clostridium thermoaceticum&quot; to produce acetic acid, with &quot;Penicillium notatum&quot; for the production of araboascorbic acid, with &quot;Rhizopus delemar&quot; for the production of fumaric acid, with &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; for the production of gluconic acid, with &quot;Candida brumptii&quot; to produce isocitric acid, with &quot;Aspergillus terreus&quot; for the production of itaconic acid, with &quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; for the production of 2-ketogluconic acid, with &quot;Gluconobacter suboxydans&quot; for the production of 5-ketogluconic acid, with &quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot; for the production of kojic acid, with &quot;Lactobacillus delbrueckii&quot; for the production of lactic acid, with &quot;Lactobacillus brevis&quot; for the production of malic acid, with &quot;Propionibacter shermanii&quot; for the production of propionic acid, with &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; for the production of pyruvic acid and with &quot;Gluconobacter suboxydans&quot; for the production of tartaric acid. Potent, bioactive natural products like triptolide that inhibit mammalian transcription via inhibition of the XPB subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIH has been recently reported as a glucose conjugate for targeting hypoxic cancer cells with increased glucose transporter expression. Recently, glucose has been gaining commercial use as a key component of &quot;kits&quot; containing lactic acid and insulin intended to induce hypoglycemia and hyperlactatemia to combat different cancers and infections.

==Analysis==
When a glucose molecule is to be detected at a certain position in a larger molecule, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography analysis or lectin immunostaining is performed with concanavalin A reporter enzyme conjugate, which binds only glucose or mannose.

===Classical qualitative detection reactions===
These reactions have only historical significance:

====Fehling test====
The Fehling test is a classic method for the detection of aldoses. Due to mutarotation, glucose is always present to a small extent as an open-chain aldehyde. By adding the Fehling reagents (Fehling (I) solution and Fehling (II) solution), the aldehyde group is oxidized to a carboxylic acid, while the Cu2+ tartrate complex is reduced to Cu+ and forms a brick red precipitate (Cu2O).

====Tollens test====
In the Tollens test, after addition of ammoniacal AgNO3 to the sample solution, glucose reduces Ag+ to elemental silver.

====Barfoed test====
In Barfoed&#x27;s test, a solution of dissolved copper acetate, sodium acetate and acetic acid is added to the solution of the sugar to be tested and subsequently heated in a water bath for a few minutes. Glucose and other monosaccharides rapidly produce a reddish color and reddish brown copper(I) oxide (Cu2O).

====Nylander&#x27;s test====
As a reducing sugar, glucose reacts in the Nylander&#x27;s test.

====Other tests====

Upon heating a dilute potassium hydroxide solution with glucose to 100 °C, a strong reddish browning and a caramel-like odor develops. Concentrated sulfuric acid dissolves dry glucose without blackening at room temperature forming sugar sulfuric acid. In a yeast solution, alcoholic fermentation produces carbon dioxide in the ratio of 2.0454 molecules of glucose to one molecule of CO2. Glucose forms a black mass with stannous chloride. In an ammoniacal silver solution, glucose (as well as lactose and dextrin) leads to the deposition of silver. In an ammoniacal lead acetate solution, white lead glycoside is formed in the presence of glucose, which becomes less soluble on cooking and turns brown. In an ammoniacal copper solution, yellow copper oxide hydrate is formed with glucose at room temperature, while red copper oxide is formed during boiling (same with dextrin, except for with an ammoniacal copper acetate solution). With Hager&#x27;s reagent, glucose forms mercury oxide during boiling. An alkaline bismuth solution is used to precipitate elemental, black-brown bismuth with glucose. Glucose boiled in an ammonium molybdate solution turns the solution blue. A solution with indigo carmine and sodium carbonate destains when boiled with glucose.

===Instrumental quantification===
====Refractometry and polarimetry====
In concentrated solutions of glucose with a low proportion of other carbohydrates, its concentration can be determined with a polarimeter. For sugar mixtures, the concentration can be determined with a refractometer, for example in the Oechsle determination in the course of the production of wine.

====Photometric enzymatic methods in solution====

The enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) converts glucose into gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide while consuming oxygen. Another enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes a chromogenic reaction (Trinder reaction) of phenol with 4-aminoantipyrine to a purple dye.

====Photometric test-strip method====
The test-strip method employs the above-mentioned enzymatic conversion of glucose to gluconic acid to form hydrogen peroxide. The reagents are immobilised on a polymer matrix, the so-called test strip, which assumes a more or less intense color. This can be measured reflectometrically at 510 nm with the aid of an LED-based handheld photometer. This allows routine blood sugar determination by nonscientists. In addition to the reaction of phenol with 4-aminoantipyrine, new chromogenic reactions have been developed that allow photometry at higher wavelengths (550 nm, 750 nm).

====Amperometric glucose sensor====
The electroanalysis of glucose is also based on the enzymatic reaction mentioned above. The produced hydrogen peroxide can be amperometrically quantified by anodic oxidation at a potential of 600 mV. The GOx is immobilized on the electrode surface or in a membrane placed close to the electrode. Precious metals such as platinum or gold are used in electrodes, as well as carbon nanotube electrodes, which e.g. are doped with boron. Cu–CuO nanowires are also used as enzyme-free amperometric electrodes, reaching a detection limit of 50 μmol/L. A particularly promising method is the so-called &quot;enzyme wiring&quot;, where the electron flowing during the oxidation is transferred via a molecular wire directly from the enzyme to the electrode.

====Other sensory methods====
There are a variety of other chemical sensors for measuring glucose. Given the importance of glucose analysis in the life sciences, numerous optical probes have also been developed for saccharides based on the use of boronic acids, which are particularly useful for intracellular sensory applications where other (optical) methods are not or only conditionally usable. In addition to the organic boronic acid derivatives, which often bind highly specifically to the 1,2-diol groups of sugars, there are also other probe concepts classified by functional mechanisms which use selective glucose-binding proteins (e.g. concanavalin A) as a receptor. Furthermore, methods were developed which indirectly detect the glucose concentration via the concentration of metabolized products, e.g. by the consumption of oxygen using fluorescence-optical sensors. Finally, there are enzyme-based concepts that use the intrinsic absorbance or fluorescence of (fluorescence-labeled) enzymes as reporters.

====Copper iodometry====
Glucose can be quantified by copper iodometry.

===Chromatographic methods===
In particular, for the analysis of complex mixtures containing glucose, e.g. in honey, chromatographic methods such as high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography are often used in combination with mass spectrometry. Taking into account the isotope ratios, it is also possible to reliably detect honey adulteration by added sugars with these methods. Derivatization using silylation reagents is commonly used. Also, the proportions of di- and trisaccharides can be quantified.

====In vivo analysis====
Glucose uptake in cells of organisms is measured with 2-deoxy-D-glucose or fluorodeoxyglucose. (18F)fluorodeoxyglucose is used as a tracer in positron emission tomography in oncology and neurology, where it is by far the most commonly used diagnostic agent.

<text>George Pólya (; , ; December 13, 1887 – September 7, 1985) was a Hungarian-American mathematician. He was a professor of mathematics from 1914 to 1940 at ETH Zürich and from 1940 to 1953 at Stanford University. He made fundamental contributions to combinatorics, number theory, numerical analysis and probability theory. He is also noted for his work in heuristics and mathematics education. He has been described as one of The Martians, an informal category which included one of his most famous students at ETH Zurich, John von Neumann.

== Life and works ==
Pólya was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary, to Anna Deutsch and Jakab Pólya, Hungarian Jews who had converted to Christianity in 1886. Although his parents were religious and he was baptized into the Catholic Church upon birth, George eventually grew up to be an agnostic. He received a PhD under Lipót Fejér in 1912, at Eötvös Loránd University. He was a professor of mathematics from 1914 to 1940 at ETH Zürich in Switzerland and from 1940 to 1953 at Stanford University. He remained a professor emeritus at Stanford for the rest of his career, working on a range of mathematical topics, including series, number theory, mathematical analysis, geometry, algebra, combinatorics, and probability. He was invited to speak at the ICM at Bologna in 1928, at Oslo in 1936 and at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1950.

On September 7, 1985, Pólya died in Palo Alto, California, United States due to complications of a stroke he suffered during that summer.

== Heuristics ==
Early in his career, Pólya wrote with Gábor Szegő two influential problem books, &quot;Problems and Theorems in Analysis&quot; (&quot;I: Series, Integral Calculus, Theory of Functions&quot; and &quot;II: Theory of Functions. Zeros. Polynomials. Determinants. Number Theory. Geometry&quot;). Later in his career, he spent considerable effort to identify systematic methods of problem-solving to further discovery and invention in mathematics for students, teachers, and researchers. He wrote five books on the subject: &quot;How to Solve It&quot;, &quot;Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning&quot; (&quot;Volume I: Induction and Analogy in Mathematics&quot;, and &quot;Volume II: Patterns of Plausible Inference&quot;), and &quot;Mathematical Discovery: On Understanding, Learning, and Teaching Problem Solving&quot; (volumes 1 and 2).

In &quot;How to Solve It&quot;, Pólya provides general heuristics for solving a gamut of problems, including both mathematical and non-mathematical problems. The book includes advice for teaching students of mathematics and a mini-encyclopedia of heuristic terms. It was translated into several languages and has sold over a million copies. The book is still used in mathematical education. Douglas Lenat&#x27;s Automated Mathematician and Eurisko artificial intelligence programs were inspired by Pólya&#x27;s work.

In addition to his works directly addressing problem solving, Pólya wrote another short book called &quot;Mathematical Methods in Science&quot;, based on a 1963 work supported by the National Science Foundation edited by Leon Bowden and published by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) in 1977. As Pólya notes in the preface, Bowden carefully followed a tape recording of a course Pólya gave several times at Stanford in order to put the book together. Pólya notes in the preface &quot;that the following pages will be useful, yet they should not be regarded as a finished expression.&quot;

== Legacy ==
There are three prizes named after Pólya, causing occasional confusion of one for another. In 1969 the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) established the George Pólya Prize, given alternately in two categories for &quot;a notable application of combinatorial theory&quot; and for &quot;a notable contribution in another area of interest to George Pólya.&quot;

In 1976 the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) established the George Pólya Award &quot;for articles of expository excellence&quot; published in the &quot;College Mathematics Journal&quot;. In 1987 the London Mathematical Society (LMS) established the Pólya Prize for &quot;outstanding creativity in, imaginative exposition of, or distinguished contribution to, mathematics within the United Kingdom.&quot; In 1991, the MAA established the George Pólya Lectureship series.

Stanford University has a Polya Hall named in his honor.

<doc id="12956" wikidata="Q304094" url="?curid=12956" title="OpenGL Utility Toolkit">
<text>The OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) is a library of utilities for OpenGL programs, which primarily perform system-level I/O with the host operating system. Functions performed include window definition, window control, and monitoring of keyboard and mouse input. Routines for drawing a number of geometric primitives (both in solid and wireframe mode) are also provided, including cubes, spheres and the Utah teapot. GLUT also has some limited support for creating pop-up menus.

GLUT was written by Mark J. Kilgard, author of &quot;OpenGL Programming for the X Window System&quot; and &quot;The Cg Tutorial: The Definitive Guide to Programmable Real-Time Graphics&quot;, while he was working for Silicon Graphics Inc.

The two aims of GLUT are to allow the creation of rather portable code between operating systems (GLUT is cross-platform) and to make learning OpenGL easier. Getting started with OpenGL programming while using GLUT often takes only a few lines of code and does not require knowledge of operating system–specific windowing APIs.

All GLUT functions start with the codice_1 prefix (for example, codice_2 marks the current window as needing to be redrawn).

== Implementations ==
The original GLUT library by Mark Kilgard supports the X Window System (GLX) and was ported to Microsoft Windows (WGL) by Nate Robins. Additionally, macOS ships with a GLUT framework that supports its own NSGL/CGL.

Kilgard&#x27;s GLUT library is no longer maintained, and its license did not permit the redistribution of modified versions of the library. This spurred the need for free software or open source reimplementations of the API from scratch. The first such library was FreeGLUT, which aims to be a reasonably close reproduction, though introducing a small number of new functions to deal with GLUT&#x27;s limitations. OpenGLUT, a fork of FreeGLUT, adds a number of new features to the original API, but work on it ceased in May 2005.

Mark Kilgard has a GitHub repository for GLUT. The glut.h header file contains the following license:

 /* Copyright (c) Mark J. Kilgard, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2006, 2010. */
 /* This program is freely distributable without licensing fees and is
 provided without guarantee or warrantee expressed or implied. This
 program is -not- in the public domain. */

== Limitations ==
Some of GLUT&#x27;s original design decisions made it hard for programmers to perform desired tasks. This led many to create non-canon patches and extensions to GLUT. Some free software or open source reimplementations also include fixes.

Some of the more notable limitations of the original GLUT library include:
* The library requires programmers to call codice_3, a function which never returns. This makes it hard for programmers to integrate GLUT into a program or library which wishes to have control of its own event loop. A common patch to fix this is to introduce a new function, called codice_4 (macOS) or codice_5 (FreeGLUT/OpenGLUT), which runs only a single iteration of the GLUT event loop. Another common workaround is to run GLUT&#x27;s event loop in a separate thread, although this may vary by operating system, and also may introduce synchronization issues or other problems: for example, the macOS GLUT implementation requires that codice_3 be run in the main thread.
* The fact that codice_3 never returns also means that a GLUT program cannot exit the event loop. FreeGLUT fixes this by introducing a new function, codice_8.
* The library terminates the process when the window is closed; for some applications this may not be desired. Thus, many implementations include an extra callback, such as codice_9.

Since it is no longer maintained (essentially replaced by the open source FreeGLUT) the above design issues are still not resolved in the original GLUT.

<doc id="12957" wikidata="Q1402" url="?curid=12957" title="Giovanni Boccaccio">
<text>Giovanni Boccaccio ( , ; ; 16 June 1313 – 21 December 1375) was an Italian writer, poet, correspondent of Petrarch, and an important Renaissance humanist. Born in the town of Certaldo, he became so well known as a writer that he was sometimes simply known as &quot;the Certaldese&quot; and one of the most important figures in the European literary panorama of the fourteenth century. Some scholars (including Vittore Branca) define him as the greatest European prose writer of his time, a versatile writer who amalgamated different literary trends and genres, making them converge in original works, thanks to a creative activity exercised under the banner of experimentalism.

His most notable works are &quot;The Decameron&quot;, a collection of short stories, and &quot;On Famous Women&quot;. &quot;The Decameron&quot; became a determining element for the Italian literary tradition, especially after Pietro Bembo elevated the Boccaccian style to a model of Italian prose in the sixteenth century. Bocaccio wrote his imaginative literature mostly in Tuscan vernacular, as well as other works in Latin, and is particularly noted for his realistic dialogue which differed from that of his contemporaries, medieval writers who usually followed formulaic models for character and plot. The influence of Boccaccio&#x27;s works was not limited to the Italian cultural scene but extended to the rest of Europe, exerting influence on authors such as Geoffrey Chaucer, a key figure in English literature, and the later writers Miguel de Cervantes, Lope de Vega and classical theatre in Spain.

Boccaccio is considered one of the &quot;Three Crowns&quot; of Italian literature along with Dante Alighieri and Petrarch. He is remembered for being one of the precursors of humanism, of which he helped lay the foundations in the city of Florence, in conjunction with the activity of his friend and teacher Petrarch. He was the one who initiated Dante&#x27;s criticism and philology: Boccaccio devoted himself to copying codices of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; and was a promoter of Dante&#x27;s work and figure.

In the twentieth century, Boccaccio was the subject of critical-philological studies by Vittore Branca and Giuseppe Billanovich, and his &quot;Decameron&quot; was transposed to the big screen by the director and writer Pier Paolo Pasolini.

== Biography ==
=== Childhood and youth, 1313–1330 ===
The details of Boccaccio&#x27;s birth are uncertain. He was born in Florence or in a village near Certaldo where his family was from. He was the son of Florentine merchant Boccaccino di Chellino and an unknown woman; he was likely born out of wedlock. Boccaccio&#x27;s stepmother was called Margherita de&#x27; Mardoli.

Boccaccio grew up in Florence. His father worked for the Compagnia dei Bardi and, in the 1320s, married Margherita dei Mardoli, who was of a well-to-do family. Boccaccio may have been tutored by Giovanni Mazzuoli and received from him an early introduction to the works of Dante. In 1326, his father was appointed head of a bank and moved with his family to Naples. Boccaccio was an apprentice at the bank but disliked the banking profession. He persuaded his father to let him study law at the &quot;Studium&quot; (the present-day University of Naples), where he studied canon law for the next six years. He also pursued his interest in scientific and literary studies.

His father introduced him to the Neapolitan nobility and the French-influenced court of Robert the Wise (the king of Naples) in the 1330s. Boccaccio became a friend of fellow Florentine Niccolò Acciaioli, and benefited from Acciaioli&#x27;s influence with Catherine of Valois-Courtenay, widow of Philip I of Taranto. Acciaioli later became a counselor to Queen Joanna I of Naples and, eventually, her &quot;Grand Seneschal&quot;.

It seems that Boccaccio enjoyed law no more than banking, but his studies allowed him the opportunity to study widely and make good contacts with fellow scholars. His early influences included Paolo da Perugia (a curator and author of a collection of myths called the &quot;Collectiones&quot;), humanists Barbato da Sulmona and Giovanni Barrili, and theologian Dionigi di Borgo San Sepolcro.
===Adult years===
In Naples, Boccaccio began what he considered his true vocation of poetry. Works produced in this period include &quot;Il Filostrato&quot; and &quot;Teseida&quot; (the sources for Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; and &quot;The Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;, respectively), &quot;The Filocolo&quot; (a prose version of an existing French romance), and &quot;La caccia di Diana&quot; (a poem in &quot;terza rima&quot; listing Neapolitan women). The period featured considerable formal innovation, including possibly the introduction of the Sicilian octave, where it influenced Petrarch.

Boccaccio returned to Florence in early 1341, avoiding the plague of 1340 in that city, but also missing the visit of Petrarch to Naples in 1341. He had left Naples due to tensions between the Angevin king and Florence. His father had returned to Florence in 1338, where he had gone bankrupt. His mother possibly died shortly afterwards. Boccaccio continued to work, although dissatisfied with his return to Florence, producing &quot;Comedia delle ninfe fiorentine&quot; in 1341 (also known as &quot;Ameto&quot;), a mix of prose and poems, completing the fifty-canto allegorical poem &quot;Amorosa visione&quot; in 1342, and &quot;Fiammetta&quot; in 1343. The pastoral piece &quot;Ninfale fiesolano&quot; probably dates from this time, also. In 1343, Boccaccio&#x27;s father remarried Bice del Bostichi. The other children by his first marriage had all died, but he had another son named Iacopo in 1344.

In Florence, the overthrow of Walter of Brienne brought about the government of &quot;popolo minuto&quot; (&quot;small people&quot;, workers). It diminished the influence of the nobility and the wealthier merchant classes and contributed to the relative decline of Florence. The city was hurt further in 1348 by the Black Death, later represented in the &quot;Decameron&quot;, which killed some three-quarters of the city&#x27;s population.

From 1347, Boccaccio spent much time in Ravenna, seeking new patronage and, despite his claims, it is not certain whether he was present in plague-ravaged Florence. His stepmother died during the epidemic and his father was closely associated with the government efforts as minister of supply in the city. His father died in 1349 and Boccaccio was forced into a more active role as head of the family.

Boccaccio began work on &quot;The Decameron&quot; around 1349. It is probable that the structures of many of the tales date from earlier in his career, but the choice of a hundred tales and the frame-story &quot;lieta brigata&quot; of three men and seven women dates from this time. The work was largely complete by 1352. It was Boccaccio&#x27;s final effort in literature and one of his last works in Tuscan vernacular; the only other substantial work was &quot;Corbaccio&quot; (dated to either 1355 or 1365). Boccaccio revised and rewrote &quot;The Decameron&quot; in 1370–1371. This manuscript has survived to the present day.

From 1350, Boccaccio became closely involved with Italian humanism (although less of a scholar) and also with the Florentine government. His first official mission was to Romagna in late 1350. He revisited that city-state twice and also was sent to Brandenburg, Milan and Avignon. He also pushed for the study of Greek, housing Leontius Pilatus, and encouraging his tentative translations of works by Homer, Euripides, and Aristotle. In these years, he also took minor orders.

In October 1350, he was delegated to greet Francesco Petrarch as he entered Florence and also to have Petrarch as a guest at Boccaccio&#x27;s home, during his stay. The meeting between the two was extremely fruitful and they were friends from then on, Boccaccio calling Petrarch his teacher and &quot;magister&quot;. Petrarch at that time encouraged Boccaccio to study classical Greek and Latin literature. They met again in Padua in 1351, Boccaccio on an official mission to invite Petrarch to take a chair at the university in Florence. Although unsuccessful, the discussions between the two were instrumental in Boccaccio writing the &quot;Genealogia deorum gentilium&quot;; the first edition was completed in 1360 and this remained one of the key reference works on classical mythology for over 400 years. It served as an extended defence for the studies of ancient literature and thought. Despite the Pagan beliefs at its core, Boccaccio believed that much could be learned from antiquity. Thus, he challenged the arguments of clerical intellectuals who wanted to limit access to classical sources to prevent any moral harm to Christian readers. The revival of classical antiquity became a foundation of the Renaissance, and his defence of the importance of ancient literature was an essential requirement for its development. The discussions also formalized Boccaccio&#x27;s poetic ideas. Certain sources also see a conversion of Boccaccio by Petrarch from the open humanist of the &quot;Decameron&quot; to a more ascetic style, closer to the dominant fourteenth-century ethos. For example, he followed Petrarch (and Dante) in the unsuccessful championing of an archaic and deeply allusive form of Latin poetry. In 1359, following a meeting with Pope Innocent VI and further meetings with Petrarch, it is probable that Boccaccio took some kind of religious mantle. There is a persistent (but unsupported) tale that he repudiated his earlier works as profane in 1362, including &quot;The Decameron&quot;.
In 1360, Boccaccio began work on &quot;De mulieribus claris (&quot;On famous women&quot;)&quot;, a book offering biographies of 106 famous women, that he completed in 1374.

A number of Boccaccio&#x27;s close friends and other acquaintances were executed or exiled in the purge following the failed coup of 1361; although not directly linked to the conspiracy, in that year Boccaccio left Florence to reside in Certaldo, where he became less involved in government affairs. He did not undertake further missions for Florence until 1365, and travelled to Naples and then on to Padua and Venice, where he met up with Petrarch in grand style at Palazzo Molina, Petrarch&#x27;s residence as well as the location of Petrarch&#x27;s library. Boccaccio later returned to Certaldo; he met Petrarch only one more time, in 1368, again in Padua. Upon hearing of the death of Petrarch (19 July 1374), he wrote a commemorative poem, including it in his collection of lyric poems, the &quot;Rime&quot;.

He returned to work for the Florentine government in 1365, undertaking a mission to Pope Urban V. The papacy returned to Rome from Avignon in 1367, and Boccaccio was again sent to Urban, offering congratulations. He also undertook diplomatic missions to Venice and Naples.

Of his later works, the moralistic biographies gathered as &quot;De casibus virorum illustrium&quot; (1355–74) and &quot;De mulieribus claris&quot; (1361–1375) were the most significant. Other works include a dictionary of geographical allusions in classical literature, &quot;De montibus, silvis, fontibus, lacubus, fluminibus, stagnis seu paludibus, et de nominibus maris liber&quot;. He gave a series of lectures on Dante at the Santo Stefano church in 1373 and these resulted in his final major work, the detailed &quot;Esposizioni sopra la Commedia di Dante&quot;. Boccaccio and Petrarch were also two of the most educated people in early Renaissance in the field of archaeology.

Petrarch even offered to purchase Boccaccio&#x27;s library, so that it would become part of Petrarch&#x27;s library. However, upon Boccaccio&#x27;s death, his entire collection was given to the monastery of Santo Spirito, in Florence, where it still resides.

Bocaccio&#x27;s final years were troubled by illnesses, some relating to obesity and what often is described as dropsy, severe edema that would be described today as congestive heart failure. He died on 21 December 1375 in Certaldo, where he is buried.

<doc id="12958" wikidata="Q7317" url="?curid=12958" title="Giuseppe Verdi">
<text>Giuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi ( , ; 9 or 10 October 1813 – 27 January 1901) was an Italian composer best known for his operas. He was born near Busseto, a small town in the province of Parma, to a family of moderate means, receiving a musical education with the help of a local patron, Antonio Barezzi. Verdi came to dominate the Italian opera scene after the era of Gioachino Rossini, Vincenzo Bellini, and Gaetano Donizetti, whose works significantly influenced him.

In his early operas, Verdi demonstrated sympathy with the Risorgimento movement which sought the unification of Italy. He also served briefly as an elected politician. The chorus &quot;Va, pensiero&quot; from his early opera &quot;Nabucco&quot; (1842), and similar choruses in later operas, were much in the spirit of the unification movement, and the composer himself became esteemed as a representative of these ideals. An intensely private person, Verdi did not seek to ingratiate himself with popular movements. As he became professionally successful, he was able to reduce his operatic workload and sought to establish himself as a landowner in his native region. He found further fame with the three peaks of his &#x27;middle period&#x27;: &quot;Rigoletto&quot; (1851), &quot;Il trovatore&quot; and &quot;La traviata&quot; (both 1853). He surprised the musical world by returning, after his success with the opera &quot;Aida&quot; (1871), with three late masterpieces: his &quot;Requiem&quot; (1874), and the operas &quot;Otello&quot; (1887) and &quot;Falstaff&quot; (1893).

Verdi&#x27;s operas remain among the most popular in the repertory. In 2013, the bicentenary of his birth was widely celebrated around the world with television and radio broadcasts and live performances.

==Life==

===Childhood and education===

Verdi, the first child of Carlo Giuseppe Verdi and Luigia Uttini, was born at their home in Le Roncole, a village near Busseto, then in the Département Taro and within the borders of the First French Empire. The baptismal register, prepared on 11 October 1813, lists his parents Carlo and Luigia as &quot;innkeeper&quot; and &quot;spinner&quot; respectively. Additionally, it lists Verdi as being &quot;born yesterday&quot;, but since days were often considered to begin at sunset, this could have meant either 9 or 10 October. Following his mother, Verdi always celebrated his birthday on 9 October, the day he himself believed he was born.

Verdi had a younger sister, Giuseppa, who died aged 17 in 1833. She is said to have been his closest friend during childhood. From age four Verdi was given private lessons in Latin and Italian by the village schoolmaster, Baistrocchi, and at six he attended the local school. After learning to play the organ, he showed so much interest in music that his parents finally provided him with a spinet. Verdi&#x27;s gift for music was already apparent by 1820–21 when he began his association with the local church, serving in the choir, acting as an altar boy for a while, and taking organ lessons. After Baistrocchi&#x27;s death, Verdi, at the age of eight, became the official paid organist.

The music historian Roger Parker points out that both of Verdi&#x27;s parents belonged to families of small landowners and traders, certainly not the illiterate peasants from which Verdi later liked to present himself as having emerged... Carlo Verdi was energetic in furthering his son&#x27;s education...something which Verdi tended to hide in later life... [T]he picture emerges of youthful precocity eagerly nurtured by an ambitious father and of a sustained, sophisticated and elaborate formal education.

In 1823, when he was 10, Verdi&#x27;s parents arranged for the boy to attend school in Busseto, enrolling him in a &quot;Ginnasio&quot;—an upper school for boys—run by Don Pietro Seletti, while they continued to run their inn at Le Roncole. Verdi returned to Busseto regularly to play the organ on Sundays, covering the distance of several kilometres on foot. At age 11, Verdi received schooling in Italian, Latin, the humanities, and rhetoric. By the time he was 12, he began lessons with Ferdinando Provesi, &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at San Bartolomeo, director of the municipal music school and co-director of the local &quot;Società Filarmonica&quot; (Philharmonic Society). Verdi later stated: &quot;From the ages of 13 to 18 I wrote a motley assortment of pieces: marches for band by the hundred, perhaps as many little &quot;sinfonie&quot; that were used in church, in the theatre and at concerts, five or six concertos and sets of variations for pianoforte, which I played myself at concerts, many serenades, cantatas (arias, duets, very many trios) and various pieces of church music, of which I remember only a &quot;Stabat Mater&quot;.&quot; This information comes from the &quot;Autobiographical Sketch&quot; which Verdi dictated to the publisher Giulio Ricordi late in life, in 1879, and remains the leading source for his early life and career. Written, understandably, with the benefit of hindsight, it is not always reliable when dealing with issues more contentious than those of his childhood.

The other director of the Philharmonic Society was , a wholesale grocer and distiller, who was described by a contemporary as a &quot;manic dilettante&quot; of music. The young Verdi did not immediately become involved with the Philharmonic. By June 1827, he had graduated with honours from the &quot;Ginnasio&quot; and was able to focus solely on music under Provesi. By chance, when he was 13, Verdi was asked to step in as a replacement to play in what became his first public event in his home town; he was an immediate success mostly playing his own music to the surprise of many and receiving strong local recognition.

By 1829–30, Verdi had established himself as a leader of the Philharmonic: &quot;none of us could rival him&quot; reported the secretary of the organisation, Giuseppe Demaldè. An eight-movement cantata, &quot;I deliri di Saul&quot;, based on a drama by Vittorio Alfieri, was written by Verdi when he was 15 and performed in Bergamo. It was acclaimed by both Demaldè and Barezzi, who commented: &quot;He shows a vivid imagination, a philosophical outlook, and sound judgment in the arrangement of instrumental parts.&quot; In late 1829, Verdi had completed his studies with Provesi, who declared that he had no more to teach Verdi. At the time, Verdi had been giving singing and piano lessons to Barezzi&#x27;s daughter Margherita; by 1831, they were unofficially engaged.

Verdi set his sights on Milan, then the cultural capital of northern Italy, where he applied unsuccessfully to study at the Conservatory. Barezzi made arrangements for him to become a private pupil of , who had been &quot;maestro concertatore&quot; at La Scala, and who described Verdi&#x27;s compositions as &quot;very promising&quot;. Lavigna encouraged Verdi to take out a subscription to La Scala, where he heard Maria Malibran in operas by Gioachino Rossini and Vincenzo Bellini. Verdi began making connections in the Milanese world of music that were to stand him in good stead. These included an introduction by Lavigna to an amateur choral group, the &quot;Società Filarmonica&quot;, led by Pietro Massini. Attending the &quot;Società&quot; frequently in 1834, Verdi soon found himself functioning as rehearsal director (for Rossini&#x27;s &quot;La Cenerentola&quot;) and continuo player. It was Massini who encouraged him to write his first opera, originally titled &quot;Rocester&quot;, to a libretto by the journalist Antonio Piazza.

===1834–1842: First operas===
In mid-1834, Verdi sought to acquire Provesi&#x27;s former post in Busseto but without success. But with Barezzi&#x27;s help, he did obtain the secular post of &quot;maestro di musica&quot;. He taught, gave lessons, and conducted the Philharmonic for several months before returning to Milan in early 1835. By the following July, he obtained his certification from Lavigna. Eventually in 1835 Verdi became director of the Busseto school with a three-year contract. He married Margherita in May 1836, and by March 1837, she had given birth to their first child, Virginia Maria Luigia on 26 March 1837. Icilio Romano followed on 11 July 1838. Both the children died young, Virginia on 12 August 1838, Icilio on 22 October 1839.

In 1837, the young composer asked for Massini&#x27;s assistance to stage his opera in Milan. The La Scala impresario, Bartolomeo Merelli, agreed to put on &quot;Oberto&quot; (as the reworked opera was now called, with a libretto rewritten by Temistocle Solera) in November 1839. It achieved a respectable 13 additional performances, following which Merelli offered Verdi a contract for three more works. In 1838-1839 Verdi published his first music with the Milan publisher Giovanni Canti.

While Verdi was working on his second opera &quot;Un giorno di regno&quot;, Margherita died of encephalitis at the age of 26. Verdi adored his wife and children and was devastated by their early deaths. &quot;Un giorno&quot;, a comedy, was premiered only a few months later. It was a flop and only given one performance. Following its failure, it is claimed Verdi vowed never to compose again, but in his &quot;Sketch&quot; he recounts how Merelli persuaded him to write a new opera.

Verdi was to claim that he gradually began to work on the music for &quot;Nabucco&quot;, the libretto of which had originally been rejected by the composer Otto Nicolai: &quot;This verse today, tomorrow that, here a note, there a whole phrase, and little by little the opera was written&quot;, he later recalled. By the autumn of 1841 it was complete, originally under the title &quot;Nabucodonosor&quot;. Well received at its first performance on 9 March 1842, &quot;Nabucco&quot; underpinned Verdi&#x27;s success until his retirement from the theatre, twenty-nine operas (including some revised and updated versions) later. At its revival in La Scala for the 1842 autumn season it was given an unprecedented (and later unequalled) total of 57 performances; within three years it had reached (among other venues) Vienna, Lisbon, Barcelona, Berlin, Paris and Hamburg; in 1848 it was heard in New York, in 1850 in Buenos Aires. Porter comments that &quot;similar accounts...could be provided to show how widely and rapidly all [Verdi&#x27;s] other successful operas were disseminated.&quot;

===1842–1849===

A period of hard work for Verdi—with the creation of twenty operas (excluding revisions and translations)—followed over the next sixteen years, culminating in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;. This period was not without its frustrations and setbacks for the young composer, and he was frequently demoralised. In April 1845, in connection with &quot;I due Foscari&quot;, he wrote: &quot;I am happy, no matter what reception it gets, and I am utterly indifferent to everything. I cannot wait for these next three years to pass. I have to write six operas, then &quot;addio&quot; to everything.&quot; In 1858 Verdi complained: &quot;Since &quot;Nabucco&quot;, you may say, I have never had one hour of peace. Sixteen years in the galleys.&quot;

After the initial success of &quot;Nabucco&quot;, Verdi settled in Milan, making a number of influential acquaintances. He attended the &quot;Salotto Maffei&quot;, Countess Clara Maffei&#x27;s salons in Milan, becoming her lifelong friend and correspondent. A revival of &quot;Nabucco&quot; followed in 1842 at La Scala where it received a run of fifty-seven performances, and this led to a commission from Merelli for a new opera for the 1843 season. &quot;I Lombardi alla prima crociata&quot; was based on a libretto by Solera and premiered in February 1843. Inevitably, comparisons were made with &quot;Nabucco&quot;; but one contemporary writer noted: &quot;If [&quot;Nabucco&quot;] created this young man&#x27;s reputation, &quot;I Lombardi&quot; served to confirm it.&quot;

Verdi paid close attention to his financial contracts, making sure he was appropriately remunerated as his popularity increased. For &quot;I Lombardi&quot; and &quot;Ernani&quot; (1844) in Venice he was paid 12,000 lire (including supervision of the productions); &quot;Attila&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1847), each brought him 18,000 lire. His contracts with the publishers Ricordi in 1847 were very specific about the amounts he was to receive for new works, first productions, musical arrangements, and so on. He began to use his growing prosperity to invest in land near his birthplace. In 1844 he purchased &quot;Il Pulgaro&quot;, 62 acres (23 hectares) of farmland with a farmhouse and outbuildings, providing a home for his parents from May 1844. Later that year, he also bought the Palazzo Cavalli (now known as the Palazzo Orlandi) on the via Roma, Busseto&#x27;s main street. In May 1848, Verdi signed a contract for land and houses at Sant&#x27;Agata in Busseto, which had once belonged to his family. It was here he built his own house, completed in 1880, now known as the Villa Verdi, where he lived from 1851 until his death.

In March 1843, Verdi visited Vienna (where Gaetano Donizetti was musical director) to oversee a production of &quot;Nabucco&quot;. The older composer, recognising Verdi&#x27;s talent, noted in a letter of January 1844: &quot;I am very, very happy to give way to people of talent like Verdi... Nothing will prevent the good Verdi from soon reaching one of the most honourable positions in the cohort of composers.&quot; Verdi travelled on to Parma, where the Teatro Regio di Parma was producing &quot;Nabucco&quot; with Giuseppina Strepponi in the cast. For Verdi, the performances were a personal triumph in his native region, especially as his father, Carlo, attended the first performance. Verdi remained in Parma for some weeks beyond his intended departure date. This fuelled speculation that the delay was due to Verdi&#x27;s interest in Strepponi (who stated that their relationship began in 1843). Strepponi was in fact known for her amorous relationships (and many illegitimate children) and her history was an awkward factor in their relationship until they eventually agreed on marriage.

After successful stagings of &quot;Nabucco&quot; in Venice (with twenty-five performances in the 1842/43 season), Verdi began negotiations with the impresario of La Fenice to stage &quot;I Lombardi&quot;, and to write a new opera. Eventually, Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Hernani&quot; was chosen, with Francesco Maria Piave as librettist. &quot;Ernani&quot; was successfully premiered in 1844 and within six months had been performed at twenty other theatres in Italy, and also in Vienna. The writer Andrew Porter notes that for the next ten years, Verdi&#x27;s life &quot;reads like a travel diary—a timetable of visits...to bring new operas to the stage or to supervise local premieres&quot;. La Scala premiered none of these new works, except for &quot;Giovanna d&#x27;Arco&quot;. Verdi &quot;never forgave the Milanese for their reception of &quot;Un giorno di regno&quot;&quot;.

During this period, Verdi began to work more consistently with his librettists. He relied on Piave again for &quot;I due Foscari&quot;, performed in Rome in November 1844, then on Solera once more for &quot;Giovanna d&#x27;Arco&quot;, at La Scala in February 1845, while in August that year he was able to work with Salvadore Cammarano on &quot;Alzira&quot; for the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples. Solera and Piave worked together on &quot;Attila&quot; for La Fenice (March 1846).

In April 1844, Verdi took on Emanuele Muzio, eight years his junior, as a pupil and amanuensis. He had known him since about 1828 as another of Barezzi&#x27;s protégés. Muzio, who in fact was Verdi&#x27;s only pupil, became indispensable to the composer. He reported to Barezzi that Verdi &quot;has a breadth of spirit, of generosity, a wisdom&quot;. In November 1846, Muzio wrote of Verdi: &quot;If you could see us, I seem more like a friend, rather than his pupil. We are always together at dinner, in the cafes, when we play cards...; all in all, he doesn&#x27;t go anywhere without me at his side; in the house we have a big table and we both write there together, and so I always have his advice.&quot; Muzio was to remain associated with Verdi, assisting in the preparation of scores and transcriptions, and later conducting many of his works in their premiere performances in the US and elsewhere outside Italy. He was chosen by Verdi as one of the executors of his will but predeceased the composer in 1890.

After a period of illness, Verdi began work on &quot;Macbeth&quot; in September 1846. He dedicated the opera to Barezzi: &quot;I have long intended to dedicate an opera to you, as you have been a father, a benefactor and a friend for me. It was a duty I should have fulfilled sooner if imperious circumstances had not prevented me. Now, I send you &quot;Macbeth&quot;, which I prize above all my other operas, and therefore deem worthier to present to you.&quot; In 1997 Martin Chusid wrote that &quot;Macbeth&quot; was the only one of Verdi&#x27;s operas of his &quot;early period&quot; to remain regularly in the international repertoire, although in the 21st century &quot;Nabucco&quot; has also entered the lists.

Strepponi&#x27;s voice declined and her engagements dried up in the 1845 to 1846 period, and she returned to live in Milan whilst retaining contact with Verdi as his &quot;supporter, promoter, unofficial adviser, and occasional secretary&quot; until she decided to move to Paris in October 1846. Before she left Verdi gave her a letter that pledged his love. On the envelope, Strepponi wrote: &quot;5 or 6 October 1846. They shall lay this letter on my heart when they bury me.&quot;

Verdi had completed &quot;I masnadieri&quot; for London by May 1847 except for the orchestration. This he left until the opera was in rehearsal, since he wanted to hear &quot;la [Jenny] Lind and modify her role to suit her more exactly&quot;. Verdi agreed to conduct the premiere on 22 July 1847 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, as well as the second performance. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attended the first performance, and for the most part, the press was generous in its praise.
For the next two years, except for two visits to Italy during periods of political unrest, Verdi was based in Paris. Within a week of returning to Paris in July 1847, he received his first commission from the Paris Opéra. Verdi agreed to adapt &quot;I Lombardi&quot; to a new French libretto; the result was &quot;Jérusalem&quot;, which contained significant changes to the music and structure of the work (including an extensive ballet scene) to meet Parisian expectations. Verdi was awarded the Order of Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. To satisfy his contracts with the publisher , Verdi dashed off &quot;Il Corsaro&quot;. Budden comments &quot;In no other opera of his does Verdi appear to have taken so little interest &quot;before&quot; it was staged.&quot;

On hearing the news of the &quot;Cinque Giornate&quot;, the &quot;Five Days&quot; of street fighting that took place between 18 and 22 March 1848 and temporarily drove the Austrians out of Milan, Verdi travelled there, arriving on 5 April. He discovered that Piave was now &quot;Citizen Piave&quot; of the newly proclaimed Republic of San Marco. Writing a patriotic letter to him in Venice, Verdi concluded &quot;Banish every petty municipal idea! We must all extend a fraternal hand, and Italy will yet become the first nation of the world...I am drunk with joy! Imagine that there are no more Germans here!!&quot;

Verdi had been admonished by the poet Giuseppe Giusti for turning away from patriotic subjects, the poet pleading with him to &quot;do what you can to nourish the [sorrow of the Italian people], to strengthen it, and direct it to its goal.&quot; Cammarano suggested adapting Joseph Méry&#x27;s 1828 play &quot;La Bataille de Toulouse&quot;, which he described as a story &quot;that should stir every man with an Italian soul in his breast&quot;. The premiere was set for late January 1849. Verdi travelled to Rome before the end of 1848. He found that city on the verge of becoming a (short-lived) republic, which commenced within days of &quot;La battaglia di Legnano&quot;″s enthusiastically received premiere. In the spirit of the time were the tenor hero&#x27;s final words, &quot;Whoever dies for the fatherland cannot be evil-minded&quot;.

Verdi had intended to return to Italy in early 1848, but was prevented by work and illness, as well as, most probably, by his increasing attachment to Strepponi. Verdi and Strepponi left Paris in July 1849, the immediate cause being an outbreak of cholera, and Verdi went directly to Busseto to continue work on completing his latest opera, &quot;Luisa Miller&quot;, for a production in Naples later in the year.

===1849–1853: Fame===
Verdi was committed to the publisher Giovanni Ricordi for an opera—which became &quot;Stiffelio&quot;—for Trieste in the Spring of 1850; and, subsequently, following negotiations with La Fenice, developed a libretto with Piave and wrote the music for &quot;Rigoletto&quot; (based on Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Le roi s&#x27;amuse&quot;) for Venice in March 1851. This was the first of a sequence of three operas (followed by &quot;Il trovatore&quot; and &quot;La traviata&quot;) which were to cement his fame as a master of opera.

The failure of &quot;Stiffelio&quot; (attributable not least to the censors of the time taking offence at the taboo subject of the supposed adultery of a clergyman&#x27;s wife and interfering with the text and roles) incited Verdi to take pains to rework it, although even in the completely recycled version of &quot;Aroldo&quot; (1857) it still failed to please. &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, with its intended murder of royalty, and its sordid attributes, also upset the censors. Verdi would not compromise: What does the sack matter to the police? Are they worried about the effect it will produce?...Do they think they know better than I?...I see the hero has been made no longer ugly and hunchbacked!! Why? A singing hunchback...why not?...I think it splendid to show this character as outwardly deformed and ridiculous, and inwardly passionate and full of love. I chose the subject for these very qualities...if they are removed I can no longer set it to music.
Verdi substituted a Duke for the King, and the public response and subsequent success of the opera all over Italy and Europe fully vindicated the composer. Aware that the melody of the Duke&#x27;s song &quot;La donna è mobile&quot; (&quot;Woman is fickle&quot;) would become a popular hit, Verdi excluded it from orchestral rehearsals for the opera, and rehearsed the tenor separately.

For several months Verdi was preoccupied with family matters. These stemmed from the way in which the citizens of Busseto were treating Giuseppina Strepponi, with whom he was living openly in an unmarried relationship. She was shunned in the town and at church, and while Verdi appeared indifferent, she was certainly not. Furthermore, Verdi was concerned about the administration of his newly acquired property at Sant&#x27;Agata. A growing estrangement between Verdi and his parents was perhaps also attributable to Strepponi (the suggestion that this situation was sparked by the birth of a child to Verdi and Strepponi which was given away as a foundling lacks any firm evidence). In January 1851, Verdi broke off relations with his parents, and in April they were ordered to leave Sant&#x27;Agata; Verdi found new premises for them and helped them financially to settle into their new home. It may not be coincidental that all six Verdi operas written in the period 1849–1853 (&quot;La battaglia, Luisa Miller, Stiffelio, Rigoletto, Il trovatore&quot; and &quot;La traviata&quot;), have, uniquely in his oeuvre, heroines who are, in the opera critic Joseph Kerman&#x27;s words, &quot;women who come to grief because of sexual transgression, actual or perceived&quot;. Kerman, like the psychologist Gerald Mendelssohn, sees this choice of subjects as being influenced by Verdi&#x27;s uneasy passion for Strepponi.

Verdi and Strepponi moved into Sant&#x27;Agata on 1 May 1851. May also brought an offer for a new opera from La Fenice, which Verdi eventually realised as &quot;La traviata&quot;. That was followed by an agreement with the Rome Opera Company to present &quot;Il trovatore&quot; for January 1853. Verdi now had sufficient earnings to retire, had he wished to. He had reached a stage where he could develop his operas as he wished, rather than be dependent on commissions from third parties. &quot;Il trovatore&quot; was in fact the first opera he wrote without a specific commission (apart from &quot;Oberto&quot;). At around the same time he began to consider creating an opera from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;. After first (1850) seeking a libretto from Cammarano (which never appeared), Verdi later (1857) commissioned one from Antonio Somma, but this proved intractable, and no music was ever written. Verdi began work on &quot;Il trovatore&quot; after the death of his mother in June 1851. The fact that this is &quot;the one opera of Verdi&#x27;s which focuses on a mother rather than a father&quot; is perhaps related to her death.

In the winter of 1851–52, Verdi decided to go to Paris with Strepponi, where he concluded an agreement with the Opéra to write what became &quot;Les vêpres siciliennes&quot;, his first original work in the style of grand opera. In February 1852, the couple attended a performance of Alexander Dumas &quot;fils&quot;″s play &quot;The Lady of the Camellias&quot;; Verdi immediately began to compose music for what would later become &quot;La traviata&quot;.

After his visit to Rome for &quot;Il trovatore&quot; in January 1853, Verdi worked on completing &quot;La traviata&quot;, but with little hope of its success, due to his lack of confidence in any of the singers engaged for the season. Furthermore, the management insisted that the opera be given a historical, not a contemporary setting. The premiere in March 1853 was indeed a failure: Verdi wrote: &quot;Was the fault mine or the singers&#x27;? Time will tell.&quot; Subsequent productions (following some rewriting) throughout Europe over the following two years fully vindicated the composer; Roger Parker has written &quot;&quot;Il trovatore&quot; consistently remains one of the three or four most popular operas in the Verdian repertoire: but it has never pleased the critics&quot;.

===1853–1860: Consolidation===
In the eleven years up to and including &quot;Traviata&quot;, Verdi had written sixteen operas. Over the next eighteen years (up to &quot;Aida&quot;), he wrote only six new works for the stage. Verdi was happy to return to Sant&#x27;Agata and, in February 1856, was reporting a &quot;total abandonment of music; a little reading; some light occupation with agriculture and horses; that&#x27;s all&quot;. A couple of months later, writing in the same vein to Countess Maffei he stated: &quot;I&#x27;m not doing anything. I don&#x27;t read. I don&#x27;t write. I walk in the fields from morning to evening, trying to recover, so far without success, from the stomach trouble caused me by &quot;I vespri siciliani&quot;. Cursed operas!&quot; An 1858 letter by Strepponi to the publisher Léon Escudier describes the kind of lifestyle that increasingly appealed to the composer: &quot;His love for the country has become a mania, madness, rage, and fury—anything you like that is exaggerated. He gets up almost with the dawn, to go and examine the wheat, the maize, the vines, etc...Fortunately our tastes for this sort of life coincide, except in the matter of sunrise, which he likes to see up and dressed, and I from my bed.&quot;

Nonetheless, on 15 May, Verdi signed a contract with La Fenice for an opera for the following spring. This was to be &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;. The couple stayed in Paris until January 1857 to deal with these proposals, and also the offer to stage the translated version of &quot;Il trovatore&quot; as a grand opera. Verdi and Strepponi travelled to Venice in March for the premiere of &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;, which turned out to be &quot;a fiasco&quot; (as Verdi reported, although on the second and third nights, the reception improved considerably).

With Strepponi, Verdi went to Naples early in January 1858 to work with Somma on the libretto of the opera &quot;Gustave III&quot;, which over a year later would become &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;. By this time, Verdi had begun to write about Strepponi as &quot;my wife&quot; and she was signing her letters as &quot;Giuseppina Verdi&quot;. Verdi raged against the stringent requirements of the Neapolitan censor stating: &quot;I&#x27;m drowning in a sea of troubles. It&#x27;s almost certain that the censors will forbid our libretto.&quot; With no hope of seeing his &quot;Gustavo III&quot; staged as written, he broke his contract. This resulted in litigation and counter-litigation; with the legal issues resolved, Verdi was free to present the libretto and musical outline of &quot;Gustave III&quot; to the Rome Opera. There, the censors demanded further changes; at this point, the opera took the title &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;.

Arriving in Sant&#x27;Agata in March 1859 Verdi and Strepponi found the nearby city of Piacenza occupied by about 6,000 Austrian troops who had made it their base, to combat the rise of Italian interest in unification in the Piedmont region. In the ensuing Second Italian War of Independence the Austrians abandoned the region and began to leave Lombardy, although they remained in control of the Venice region under the terms of the armistice signed at Villafranca. Verdi was disgusted at this outcome: &quot;[W]here then is the independence of Italy, so long hoped for and promised?...Venice is not Italian? After so many victories, what an outcome... It is enough to drive one mad&quot; he wrote to Clara Maffei.

Verdi and Strepponi now decided on marriage; they travelled to Collonges-sous-Salève, a village then part of Piedmont. On 29 August 1859, the couple were married there, with only the coachman who had driven them there and the church bell ringer as witnesses. At the end of 1859, Verdi wrote to his friend Cesare De Sanctis &quot;[Since completing &quot;Ballo&quot;] I have not made any more music, I have not seen any more music, I have not thought anymore about music. I don&#x27;t even know what colour my last opera is, and I almost don&#x27;t remember it.&quot; He began to remodel Sant&#x27;Agata, which took most of 1860 to complete and on which he continued to work for the next twenty years. This included major work on a square room that became his workroom, his bedroom, and his office.
===Politics===
Having achieved some fame and prosperity, Verdi began in 1859 to take an active interest in Italian politics. His early commitment to the Risorgimento movement is difficult to estimate accurately; in the words of the music historian Philip Gossett &quot;myths intensifying and exaggerating [such] sentiment began circulating&quot; during the nineteenth century. An example is the claim that when the &quot;Va, pensiero&quot; chorus in &quot;Nabucco&quot; was first sung in Milan, the audience, responding with nationalistic fervour, demanded an encore. As encores were expressly forbidden by the government at the time, such a gesture would have been extremely significant. But in fact the piece encored was not &quot;Va, pensiero&quot; but the hymn &quot;Immenso Jehova&quot;.

The growth of the &quot;identification of Verdi&#x27;s music with Italian nationalist politics&quot; perhaps began in the 1840s. In 1848, the nationalist leader Giuseppe Mazzini (whom Verdi had met in London the previous year) requested Verdi (who complied) to write a patriotic hymn. The opera historian Charles Osborne describes the 1849 &quot;La battaglia di Legnano&quot; as &quot;an opera with a purpose&quot; and maintains that &quot;while parts of Verdi&#x27;s earlier operas had frequently been taken up by the fighters of the Risorgimento...this time the composer had given the movement its own opera&quot;. It was not until 1859 in Naples, and only then spreading throughout Italy, that the slogan &quot;Viva Verdi&quot; was used as an acronym for &quot;Viva Vittorio Emanuele Re D&#x27;Italia&quot; (&quot;Long live Victor Emmanuel, King of Italy&quot;), in reference to the then king of Sardinia and future king of Italy. After Italy was unified in 1861, many of Verdi&#x27;s early operas were increasingly re-interpreted as Risorgimento works with hidden revolutionary messages that perhaps had not been originally intended by either the composer or his librettists.

In 1859, Verdi was elected as a member of the new provincial council, and was appointed to head a group of five who would meet with King Vittorio Emanuele II in Turin. They were enthusiastically greeted along the way and in Turin Verdi himself received much of the publicity. On 17 October Verdi met with Cavour, the architect of the initial stages of Italian unification. Later that year the government of Emilia was subsumed under the United Provinces of Central Italy, and Verdi&#x27;s political life temporarily came to an end. Whilst still maintaining nationalist feelings, he declined in 1860 the office of provincial council member to which he had been elected &quot;in absentia&quot;. Cavour however was anxious to convince a man of Verdi&#x27;s stature that running for political office was essential to strengthening and securing Italy&#x27;s future. The composer confided to Piave some years later that &quot;I accepted on the condition that after a few months I would resign.&quot; Verdi was elected on 3 February 1861 for the town of Borgo San Donnino (Fidenza) to the Parliament of Piedmont-Sardinia in Turin (which from March 1861 became the Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy), but following the death of Cavour in 1861, which deeply distressed him, he scarcely attended. Later, in 1874, Verdi was appointed a member of the Italian Senate, but did not participate in its activities.

===1860–1887: from &quot;La forza&quot; to &quot;Otello&quot;===

In the months following the staging of &quot;Ballo&quot;, Verdi was approached by several opera companies seeking a new work or making offers to stage one of his existing ones but refused them all. But when, in December 1860, an approach was made from Saint Petersburg&#x27;s Imperial Theatre, the offer of 60,000 francs plus all expenses was doubtless a strong incentive. Verdi came up with the idea of adapting the 1835 Spanish play &quot;Don Alvaro o la fuerza del sino&quot; by Angel Saavedra, which became &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, with Piave writing the libretto. The Verdis arrived in Saint Petersburg in December 1861 for the premiere, but casting problems meant that it had to be postponed.

Returning via Paris from Russia on 24 February 1862, Verdi met two young Italian writers, the twenty-year-old Arrigo Boito and Franco Faccio. Verdi had been invited to write a piece of music for the 1862 International Exhibition in London, and charged Boito with writing a text, which became the &quot;Inno delle nazioni&quot;. Boito, as a supporter of the grand opera of Giacomo Meyerbeer and an opera composer in his own right, was later in the 1860s critical of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;reliance on formula rather than form&quot;, incurring the composer&#x27;s wrath. Nevertheless, he was to become Verdi&#x27;s close collaborator in his final operas. The Saint Petersburg premiere of &quot;La forza&quot; finally took place in September 1862, and Verdi received the Order of St. Stanislaus.

A revival of &quot;Macbeth&quot; in Paris in 1865 was not a success, but he obtained a commission for a new work, &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, based on the play &quot;Don Carlos&quot; by Friedrich Schiller. He and Giuseppina spent late 1866 and much of 1867 in Paris, where they heard, and did not warm to, Giacomo Meyerbeer&#x27;s last opera, &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;, and Richard Wagner&#x27;s overture to &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. The opera&#x27;s premiere in 1867 drew mixed comments. While the critic Théophile Gautier praised the work, the composer Georges Bizet was disappointed at Verdi&#x27;s changing style: &quot;Verdi is no longer Italian. He is following Wagner.&quot;

During the 1860s and 1870s, Verdi paid great attention to his estate around Busseto, purchasing additional land, dealing with unsatisfactory (in one case, embezzling) stewards, installing irrigation, and coping with variable harvests and economic slumps. In 1867, both Verdi&#x27;s father Carlo, with whom he had restored good relations, and his early patron and father-in-law Antonio Barezzi, died. Verdi and Giuseppina decided to adopt Carlo&#x27;s great-niece Filomena Maria Verdi, then seven years old, as their own child. She was to marry in 1878 the son of Verdi&#x27;s friend and lawyer Angelo Carrara and her family became eventually the heirs of Verdi&#x27;s estate.

&quot;Aida&quot; was commissioned by the Egyptian government for the opera house built by the Khedive Isma&#x27;il Pasha to celebrate the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. The opera house actually opened with a production of &quot;Rigoletto&quot;. The prose libretto in French by Camille du Locle, based on a scenario by the Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, was transformed into Italian verse by Antonio Ghislanzoni. Verdi was offered the enormous sum of 150,000 francs for the opera (even though he confessed that Ancient Egypt was &quot;a civilization I have never been able to admire&quot;), and it was first performed in Cairo in 1871. Verdi spent much of 1872 and 1873 supervising the Italian productions of &quot;Aida&quot; at Milan, Parma and Naples, effectively acting as producer and demanding high standards and adequate rehearsal time. During the rehearsals for the Naples production he wrote his string quartet, the only chamber music by him to survive, and the only major work in the form by an Italian of the 19th century.

In 1869, Verdi had been asked to compose a section for a requiem mass in memory of Rossini. He compiled and completed the requiem, but its performance was abandoned (and its premiere did not take place until 1988). Five years later, Verdi reworked his &quot;Libera Me&quot; section of the Rossini Requiem and made it a part of his Requiem honouring Alessandro Manzoni, who had died in 1873. The complete Requiem was first performed at the cathedral in Milan on the anniversary of Manzoni&#x27;s death on 22 May 1874. The &quot;spinto&quot; soprano Teresa Stolz, who had sung in La Scala productions from 1865 onwards, was the soloist in the first and many later performances of the Requiem; in February 1872, she had created Aida in its European premiere in Milan. She became closely associated personally with Verdi (exactly how closely remains conjectural), to Giuseppina Verdi&#x27;s initial disquiet; but the women were reconciled and Stolz remained a companion of Verdi after Giuseppina&#x27;s death in 1897 until his own death.

Verdi conducted his Requiem in Paris, London and Vienna in 1875 and in Cologne in 1876. It seemed that it would be his last work. In the words of his biographer John Rosselli, it &quot;confirmed him as the unique presiding genius of Italian music. No fellow composer...came near him in popularity or reputation&quot;. Verdi, now in his sixties, initially seemed to withdraw into retirement. He deliberately shied away from opportunities to publicise himself or to become involved with new productions of his works, but secretly he began work on &quot;Otello&quot;, which Boito (to whom the composer had been reconciled by Ricordi) had proposed to him privately in 1879. The composition was delayed by a revision of &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; which Verdi undertook with Boito, produced in 1881, and a revision of &quot;Don Carlos&quot;. Even when &quot;Otello&quot; was virtually completed, Verdi teased &quot;Shall I finish it? Shall I have it performed? Hard to tell, even for me.&quot; As news leaked out, Verdi was pressed by opera houses across Europe with enquiries; eventually the opera was triumphantly premiered at La Scala in February 1887.

===1887–1901: &quot;Falstaff&quot; and last years===

Following the success of &quot;Otello&quot; Verdi commented, &quot;After having relentlessly massacred so many heroes and heroines, I have at last the right to laugh a little.&quot; He had considered a variety of comic subjects but had found none of them wholly suitable and confided his ambition to Boito. The librettist said nothing at the time but secretly began work on a libretto based on &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; with additional material taken from &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot;. Verdi received the draft libretto probably in early July 1889 after he had just read Shakespeare&#x27;s play: &quot;Benissimo! Benissimo!... No one could have done better than you&quot;, he wrote back to Boito. But he still had doubts: his age, his health (which he admits to being good) and his ability to complete the project: &quot;If I were not to finish the music?&quot;. If the project failed, it would have been a waste of Boito&#x27;s time, and have distracted him from completing his own new opera. Finally, on 10 July 1889, he wrote again: &quot;So be it! So let&#x27;s do &quot;Falstaff&quot;! For now, let&#x27;s not think of obstacles, of age, of illnesses!&quot; Verdi emphasised the need for secrecy but continued &quot;If you are in the mood, then start to write.&quot; Later he wrote to Boito: &quot;What joy to be able to say to the public: HERE WE ARE AGAIN!!! COME AND SEE US!&quot;
The first performance of &quot;Falstaff&quot; took place at La Scala on 9 February 1893. For the first night, official ticket prices were thirty times higher than usual. Royalty, aristocracy, critics and leading figures from the arts all over Europe were present. The performance was a huge success; numbers were encored, and at the end, the applause for Verdi and the cast lasted an hour. That was followed by a tumultuous welcome when the composer, his wife and Boito arrived at the Grand Hotel de Milan. Even more hectic scenes ensued when he went to Rome in May for the opera&#x27;s premiere at the Teatro Costanzi; crowds of well-wishers at the railway station initially forced Verdi to take refuge in a tool-shed. He witnessed the performance from the Royal Box at the side of King Umberto and Queen Margherita.

In his last years, Verdi undertook a number of philanthropic ventures, publishing in 1894 a song for the benefit of earthquake victims in Sicily, and from 1895 onwards planning, building and endowing a rest-home for retired musicians in Milan, the Casa di Riposo per Musicisti, and building a hospital at Villanova sull&#x27;Arda, close to Busseto. His last major composition, the choral set of &quot;Four sacred pieces&quot;, was published in 1898. In 1900 he was deeply upset at the assassination of King Umberto and sketched a setting of a poem in his memory, but was unable to complete it.

While staying at the Grand Hotel, Verdi suffered a stroke on 21 January 1901. He gradually grew more feeble over the next week, during which Stolz cared for him, and died on 27 January at the age of 87.
Verdi was initially buried in a private ceremony at Milan&#x27;s Cimitero Monumentale. A month later, his body was moved to the crypt of the Casa di Riposo. On this occasion, &quot;Va, pensiero&quot; from &quot;Nabucco&quot; was conducted by Arturo Toscanini with a chorus of 820 singers. A huge crowd was in attendance, estimated at 300,000. Boito wrote to a friend, in words which recall the mysterious final scene of &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, &quot;[Verdi] sleeps like a King of Spain in his Escurial, under a bronze slab that completely covers him.&quot;

==Personality==
Not all of Verdi&#x27;s personal qualities were amiable. John Rosselli concluded after writing his biography that &quot;I do not very much like the man Verdi, in particular the autocratic rentier-cum-estate owner, part-time composer, and seemingly full-time grumbler and reactionary critic of the later years&quot;, yet admits that like other writers, he must &quot;admire him, warts and all...a deep integrity runs beneath his life, and can be felt even when he is being unreasonable or wrong&quot;.

Budden suggests that &quot;With Verdi...the man and the artist in many ways developed side by side.&quot; Ungainly and awkward in society in his early years, &quot;as he became a man of property and underwent the civilizing influence of Giuseppina...[he] acquired assurance and authority.&quot; He also learnt to keep himself to himself, never discussing his private life and maintaining, when it suited him, legends about his supposed &#x27;peasant&#x27; origins, his materialism and his indifference to criticism. Gerald Mendelsohn describes the composer as &quot;an intensely private man who deeply resented efforts to inquire into his personal affairs. He regarded journalists and would-be biographers, as well as his neighbours in Busseto and the operatic public at large, as an intrusive lot, against whose prying attentions he needed constantly to defend himself.&quot;

Verdi was never explicit about his religious beliefs. Anti-clerical by nature in his early years, he nonetheless built a chapel at Sant&#x27;Agata but is little recorded as attending church. Strepponi wrote in 1871 &quot;I won&#x27;t say [Verdi] is an atheist, but he is not much of a believer.&quot; Rosselli comments that in the Requiem &quot;The prospect of Hell appears to rule...[the Requiem] is troubled to the end,&quot; and offers little consolation.

==Music==
===Spirit===
The writer Friedrich Schiller (four of whose plays were adapted as operas by Verdi) distinguished two types of artists in his 1795 essay &quot;On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry&quot;. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin ranked Verdi in the &#x27;naïve&#x27; category—&quot;They are not...self-conscious. They do not...stand aside to contemplate their creations and express their own feelings...They are able...if they have genius, to embody their vision fully.&quot; (The &#x27;sentimentals&#x27; seek to recreate nature and natural feelings on their own terms—Berlin instances Richard Wagner—&quot;offering not peace, but a sword&quot;.) Verdi&#x27;s operas are not written according to an aesthetic theory, or with a purpose to change the tastes of their audiences. In conversation with a German visitor in 1887 he is recorded as saying that, whilst &quot;there was much to be admired in [Wagner&#x27;s operas] &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; and &quot;Lohengrin&quot;...in his recent operas [Wagner] seemed to be overstepping the bounds of what can be expressed in music. For him &quot;philosophical&quot; music was incomprehensible.&quot; Although Verdi&#x27;s works belong, as Rosselli admits &quot;to the most artificial of genres...[they] ring emotionally true: truth and directness make them exciting, often hugely so.&quot;

===Periods===
The earliest study of Verdi&#x27;s music, published in 1859 by the Italian critic Abramo Basevi, already distinguished four periods in Verdi&#x27;s music. The early, &#x27;grandiose&#x27; period, ended according to Basevi with &quot;La battaglia di Legnano&quot; (1849), and a &#x27;personal&#x27; style began with the next opera &quot;Luisa Miller&quot;. These two operas are generally agreed today by critics to mark the division between Verdi&#x27;s &#x27;early&#x27; and &#x27;middle&#x27; periods. The &#x27;middle&#x27; period is felt to end with &quot;La traviata&quot; (1853) and &quot;Les vêpres siciliennes&quot; (1855), with a &#x27;late&#x27; period commencing with &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; (1857) running through to &quot;Aida&quot; (1871). The last two operas, &quot;Otello&quot; and &quot;Falstaff&quot;, together with the Requiem and the &quot;Four Sacred Pieces&quot;, then represent a &#x27;final&#x27; period.

====Early period====
Verdi was to claim in his &quot;Sketch&quot; that during his early training with Lavigna &quot;I did nothing but canons and fugues...No-one taught me orchestration or how to handle dramatic music.&quot; He is known to have written a variety of music for the Busseto Philharmonic society, including vocal music, band music and chamber works, (and including an alternative overture to Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Barber of Seville&quot;) but few of these works survive. (He may have given instructions before his death to destroy his early works).

Verdi uses in his early operas (and, in his own stylized versions, throughout his later work) the standard elements of Italian opera content of the period, referred to by the opera writer Julian Budden as the &#x27;Code Rossini&#x27;, after the composer who established through his work and popularity the accepted templates of these forms; they were also used by the composers dominant during Verdi&#x27;s early career, Bellini, Donizetti and Saverio Mercadante. Amongst the essential elements are the aria, the duet, the ensemble, and the finale sequence of an act. The aria format, centred on a soloist, typically involved three sections; a slow introduction, marked typically cantabile or adagio, a &quot;tempo di mezzo&quot; which might involve chorus or other characters, and a cabaletta, an opportunity for bravura singing for the soloist. The duet was similarly formatted. Finales, covering climactic sequences of action, used the various forces of soloists, ensemble and chorus, usually culminating with an exciting stretto section. Verdi was to develop these and the other formulae of the generation preceding him with increasing sophistication during his career.

The operas of the early period show Verdi learning by doing and gradually establishing mastery over the different elements of opera. &quot;Oberto&quot; is poorly structured, and the orchestration of the first operas is generally simple, sometimes even basic. The musicologist Richard Taruskin suggested &quot;the most striking effect in the early Verdi operas, and the one most obviously allied to the mood of the Risorgimento, was the big choral number sung—crudely or sublimely, according to the ear of the beholder—in unison. The success of &quot;Va, pensiero&quot; in &quot;Nabucco&quot; (which Rossini approvingly denoted as &quot;a grand aria sung by sopranos, contraltos, tenors and basses&quot;), was replicated in the similar &quot;O Signor, dal tetto natio&quot; in &quot;I lombardi&quot; and in 1844 in the chorus &quot;Si ridesti il Leon di Castiglia&quot; in &quot;Ernani&quot;, the battle hymn of the conspirators seeking freedom. In &quot;I due Foscari&quot; Verdi first uses recurring themes identified with main characters; here and in future operas the accent moves away from the &#x27;oratorio&#x27; characteristics of the first operas towards individual action and intrigue.

From this period onwards Verdi also develops his instinct for &quot;tinta&quot; (literally &#x27;colour&#x27;), a term which he used for characterising elements of an individual opera score—Parker gives as an example &quot;the rising 6th that begins so many lyric pieces in &quot;Ernani&quot;&quot;. &quot;Macbeth&quot;, even in its original 1847 version, shows many original touches; characterization by key (the Macbeths themselves generally singing in sharp keys, the witches in flat keys), a preponderance of minor key music, and highly original orchestration. In the &#x27;dagger scene&#x27; and the duet following the murder of Duncan, the forms transcend the &#x27;Code Rossini&#x27; and compellingly propel the drama. Verdi was to comment in 1868 that Rossini and his followers missed &quot;the golden thread that binds all the parts together and, rather than a set of numbers without coherence, makes an opera&quot;. &quot;Tinta&quot; was for Verdi this &quot;golden thread&quot;, an essential unifying factor in his works.
====Middle period====

The writer David Kimbell states that in &quot;Luisa Miller&quot; and &quot;Stiffelio&quot; (the earliest operas of this period) there appears to be a &quot;growing freedom in the large scale structure...and an acute attention to fine detail&quot;. Others echo those feelings. Julian Budden expresses the impact of &quot;Rigoletto&quot; and its place in Verdi&#x27;s output as follows: &quot;Just after 1850 at the age of 38, Verdi closed the door on a period of Italian opera with &quot;Rigoletto&quot;. The so-called &quot;ottocento&quot; in music is finished. Verdi will continue to draw on certain of its forms for the next few operas, but in a totally new spirit.&quot; One example of Verdi&#x27;s wish to move away from &quot;standard forms&quot; appears in his feelings about the structure of &quot;Il trovatore&quot;. To his librettist, Cammarano, Verdi plainly states in a letter of April 1851 that if there were no standard forms—&quot;cavatinas, duets, trios, choruses, finales, etc. ... and if you could avoid beginning with an opening chorus...&quot;, he would be quite happy.

Two external factors had their impacts on Verdi&#x27;s compositions of this period. One is that with increasing reputation and financial security he no longer needed to commit himself to the productive treadmill, had more freedom to choose his own subjects, and had more time to develop them according to his own ideas. In the years 1849 to 1859, he wrote eight new operas, compared with fourteen in the previous ten years.

Another factor was the changed political situation; the failure of the 1848 revolutions led both to some diminution of the Risorgimento ethos (at least initially) and a significant increase in theatre censorship. This is reflected both in Verdi&#x27;s choices of plots dealing more with personal relationships than political conflict, and in a (partly consequent) dramatic reduction in the operas of this period in the number of choruses (of the type which had first made him famous)—not only are there on average 40% fewer choruses in the &#x27;middle&#x27; period operas compared to the &#x27;early&#x27; period&#x27;, but whereas virtually all the &#x27;early&#x27; operas commence with a chorus, only one (&quot;Luisa Miller&quot;) of the &#x27;middle&#x27; period operas begin this way. Instead, Verdi experiments with a variety of means, e.g. a stage band (&quot;Rigoletto&quot;), an aria for bass (&quot;Stiffelio&quot;), a party scene (&quot;La traviata&quot;). Chusid also notes Verdi&#x27;s increasing tendency to replace full-scale overtures with shorter orchestral introductions. Parker comments that &quot;La traviata&quot;, the last opera of the &#x27;middle&#x27; period, is &quot;again a new adventure. It gestures towards a level of &#x27;realism&#x27;...the contemporary world of waltzes pervades the score, and the heroine&#x27;s death from disease is graphically depicted in the music.&quot; Verdi&#x27;s increasing command of musical highlighting of changing moods and relationships is exemplified in act 3 of &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, where Duke&#x27;s flippant song &quot;La donna è mobile&quot; is followed immediately by the quartet &quot;Bella figlia dell&#x27;amore&quot;, contrasting the rapacious Duke and his inamorata with the (concealed) indignant Rigoletto and his grieving daughter. Taruskin asserts this is &quot;the most famous ensemble Verdi ever composed&quot;.

====Late period====
 Chusid notes Strepponi&#x27;s description of the operas of the 1860s and 1870s as being &quot;modern&quot; whereas Verdi described the pre-1849 works as &quot;the cavatina operas&quot;, as further indication that &quot;Verdi became increasingly dissatisfied with the older, familiar conventions of his predecessors that he had adopted at the outset of his career,&quot; Parker sees a physical differentiation of the operas from &quot;Les vêpres siciliennes&quot; (1855) to &quot;Aida&quot; (1871) is that they are significantly longer, and with larger cast-lists, than previous works. They also reflect a shift towards the French genre of grand opera, notable in more colourful orchestration, counterpointing of serious and comic scenes, and greater spectacle. The opportunities of transforming Italian opera by utilising such resources appealed to him. For a commission from the Paris Opéra he expressly demanded a libretto from Eugène Scribe, the favourite librettist of Meyerbeer, telling him: &quot;I want—in fact, I must have—a grandiose, impassioned and original subject.&quot; The result was &quot;Les vêpres siciliennes&quot;, and the scenarios of &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; (1857), &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; (1859), &quot;La forza del destino&quot; (1862), &quot;Don Carlos&quot; (1867) and &quot;Aida&quot; (1871) all meet the same criteria. Porter notes that &quot;Un ballo&quot; marks an almost complete synthesis of Verdi&#x27;s style with the grand opera hallmarks, such that &quot;huge spectacle is not mere decoration but essential to the drama...musical and theatrical lines remain taut [and] the characters still sing as warmly, passionately and personally as in &quot;Il trovatore&quot;.&quot;

When the composer Ferdinand Hiller asked Verdi whether he preferred &quot;Aida&quot; or &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, Verdi replied that &quot;Aida&quot; had &quot;more bite and (if you&#x27;ll forgive the word), more &quot;theatricality&quot;&quot;. During the rehearsals for the Naples production of &quot;Aida&quot; Verdi amused himself by writing his only string quartet, a sprightly work which shows in its last movement that he had not lost the skill for fugue-writing that he had learned with Lavigna.

====Final works====

Verdi&#x27;s three last major works continued to show new developments in conveying drama and emotion. The first to appear, in 1874 was his Requiem, scored for operatic forces but by no means an &quot;opera in ecclesiastical dress&quot; (the words in which Hans von Bülow condemned it before even hearing it). Although in the Requiem Verdi puts to use many of the techniques he learned in opera, its musical forms and emotions are not those of the stage. Verdi&#x27;s tone painting at the opening of the Requiem is vividly described by the Italian composer Ildebrando Pizzetti, writing in 1941: &quot;in [the words] murmured by an invisible crowd over the slow swaying of a few simple chords, you straightaway sense the fear and sadness of a vast multitude before the mystery of death. In the [following] &quot;Et lux perpetuum&quot; the melody spreads it wings...before falling back on itself...you hear a sigh for consolation and eternal peace.&quot;

By the time &quot;Otello&quot; premièred in 1887, more than 15 years after &quot;Aida&quot;, the operas of Verdi&#x27;s (predeceased) contemporary Richard Wagner had begun their ascendancy in popular taste, and many sought or identified Wagnerian aspects in Verdi&#x27;s latest composition. Budden points out that there is little in the music of &quot;Otello&quot; that relates either to the &quot;verismo&quot; opera of the younger Italian composers, and little if anything which can be construed as a homage to the New German School. Nonetheless, there is still much originality, building on the strengths which Verdi had already demonstrated; the powerful storm which opens the opera &quot;in medias res&quot;, the recollection of the love duet of Act I in Otello&#x27;s dying words (more an aspect of &quot;tinta&quot; than &quot;leitmotif&quot;), imaginative touches of harmony in Iago&#x27;s &quot;Era la notte&quot; (Act II).

Finally, six years later, appeared &quot;Falstaff&quot;, Verdi&#x27;s only comedy apart from the early, ill-fated &quot;Un giorno di regno&quot;. In this work, Roger Parker writes that:
:&quot;The listener is bombarded by a stunning diversity of rhythms, orchestral textures, melodic motifs and harmonic devices. Passages that in earlier times would have furnished material for an entire number here crowd in on each other, shouldering themselves unceremoniously to the fore in bewildering succession&quot;. Rosselli comments: &quot;In &quot;Otello&quot; Verdi had miniaturized the forms of romantic Italian opera; in &quot;Falstaff&quot; he miniaturized himself...[M]oments...crystallize a feeling...as though an aria or duet had been precipitated into a phrase.&quot;
==Legacy==
===Reception===
Although Verdi&#x27;s operas brought him a popular following, not all contemporary critics approved of his work. The English critic Henry Chorley allowed in 1846 that &quot;he is the only modern man...having a style—for better or worse&quot;, but found all his output unacceptable. &quot;[His] faults [are] grave ones, calculated to destroy and degrade taste beyond those of any Italian composer in the long list&quot; wrote Chorley, whilst conceding that &quot;howsoever incomplete may have been his training, howsoever mistaken his aspirations may have proved...he &quot;has&quot; aspired.&quot; But by the time of Verdi&#x27;s death, 55 years later, his reputation was assured, and the 1910 edition of Grove&#x27;s Dictionary pronounced him &quot;one of the greatest and most popular opera composers of the nineteenth century&quot;.

Verdi had no pupils apart from Muzio and no school of composers sought to follow his style. By his death, &quot;verismo&quot; was the accepted style of young Italian composers. The New York Metropolitan Opera frequently staged &quot;Rigoletto, Trovatore&quot; and &quot;Traviata&quot; during this period and featured &quot;Aida&quot; in every season from 1898 to 1945. Interest in the operas reawakened in mid-1920s Germany and this sparked a revival in England and elsewhere. From the 1930s onward there began to appear scholarly biographies and publications of documentation and correspondence.

In 1959 the Instituto di Studi Verdiani (from 1989 the Istituto Nazionale di Studi Verdiani) was founded in Parma and became a leading centre for research and publication of Verdi studies, and in the 1970s the American Institute for Verdi Studies was founded at New York University.

===Nationalism in the operas===
Historians have debated how political Verdi&#x27;s operas were. In particular, the &quot;Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves&quot; (known as &quot;Va, pensiero&quot;) from the third act of the opera &quot;Nabucco&quot; was used an anthem for Italian patriots, who were seeking to unify their country and free it from foreign control in the years up to 1861 (the chorus&#x27;s theme of exiles singing about their homeland, and its lines such as &quot;O mia patria, si bella e perduta&quot; / &quot;O my country, so lovely and so lost&quot; were thought to have resonated with many Italians). Beginning in Naples in 1859 and spreading throughout Italy, the slogan &quot;Viva VERDI&quot; was used as an acronym for &quot;Viva Vittorio Emanuele Re D&#x27;Italia&quot; (&quot;Long live Victor Emmanuel King of Italy&quot;), referring to Victor Emmanuel II. Marco Pizzo argues that after 1815, music became a political tool, and many songwriters expressed ideals of freedom and equality. Pizzo claims that Verdi was part of this movement, for his operas were inspired by the love of country, the struggle for Italian independence, and spoke to the sacrifice of patriots and exiles. George Martin claims Verdi was &quot;the greatest artist&quot; of the Risorgimento. &quot;Throughout his work its values, its issues recur constantly, and he expressed them with great power&quot;.

But Mary Ann Smart argues that music critics at the time seldom mentioned any political themes. Likewise, Roger Parker argues that the political dimension of Verdi&#x27;s operas was exaggerated by nationalistic historians in the late 19th century.
From the 1850s onwards, Verdi&#x27;s operas displayed few patriotic themes because of the heavy censorship by the absolutist regime in power. Verdi later became disillusioned by politics, but he was personally active part in the political world of events of the Risorgimento and was elected to the first Italian parliament in 1861.

===Memorials and cultural portrayals===
Three Italian conservatories, the Milan Conservatory and those in Turin and Como, are named after Verdi, as are many Italian theatres.

Verdi&#x27;s hometown of Busseto displays Luigi Secchi&#x27;s statue of a seated Verdi in 1913, next to the Teatro Verdi built in his honour in the 1850s. It is one of many statues of the composer in Italy. The Giuseppe Verdi Monument, a 1906 marble memorial, sculpted by Pasquale Civiletti, is located in Verdi Square in New York City. The monument includes a statue of Verdi himself and life-sized statues of four characters from his operas.
Verdi has been the subject of several film and stage works. These include the 1938 film directed by Carmine Gallone, &quot;Giuseppe Verdi&quot;, starring Fosco Giachetti; the 1982 miniseries, &quot;The Life of Verdi&quot;, directed by Renato Castellani, where Verdi was played by Ronald Pickup, with narration by Burt Lancaster in the English version; and the 1985 play &quot;After Aida&quot;, by Julian Mitchell (1985). He is a character in the 2011 opera &quot;Risorgimento!&quot; by Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero.

===Verdi today===
Verdi&#x27;s operas are frequently staged around the world. All of his operas are available in recordings, and on DVD – Naxos Records offers a complete boxed set.

Modern productions may differ substantially from those originally envisaged by the composer. Jonathan Miller&#x27;s 1982 version of &quot;Rigoletto&quot; for English National Opera, set in the world of modern American mafiosi, received critical plaudits. But the same company&#x27;s staging in 2002 of &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; as &quot;A Masked Ball&quot;, directed by Calixto Bieito, including &quot;satanic sex rituals, homosexual rape, [and] a demonic dwarf&quot;, got a general critical thumbs down.

Excerpts from the Requiem were featured at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. On 12 March 2011 during a performance of &quot;Nabucco&quot; at the Opera di Roma celebrating 150 years of Italian unification, the conductor Riccardo Muti paused after &quot;Va, pensiero&quot; and turned to address the audience (which included the then Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi) to complain about cuts in state funding of culture; the audience then joined in a repeat of the chorus. In 2014, the pop singer Katy Perry appeared at the Grammy Award wearing a dress designed by Valentino, embroidered with the music of &quot;Dell&#x27;invito trascorsa è già l&#x27;ora&quot; from the start of &quot;La traviata&quot;. The bicentenary of Verdi&#x27;s birth in 2013 was celebrated around the world, both in performances and broadcasts.

<text>The German Navy (, ) is part of the unified (Federal Defense), the German Armed Forces. The German Navy was originally known as the &quot;Bundesmarine&quot; (Federal Navy) from 1956 to 1995, when &quot;Deutsche Marine&quot; (German Navy) became the official name with respect to the 1990 incorporation of the East German &quot;Volksmarine&quot; (People&#x27;s Navy). It is deeply integrated into the NATO alliance. Its primary mission is protection of Germany&#x27;s territorial waters and maritime infrastructure as well as sea lines of communication. Apart from this, the German Navy participates in peacekeeping operations, and renders humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. It also participates in anti-piracy operations.

==History==

German Naval history has its roots in the naval history of the Holy Roman Empire, to which the Dutch Navy and even the Spanish Navy once belonged. Proper German language early maritime history is represented by the Hanseatic League and the Brandenburg Navy, later Prussian Navy.
The modern German Navy traces its roots back to the &quot;Reichsflotte&quot; (Imperial Fleet) of the revolutionary era of 1848–52. The &quot;Reichsflotte&quot; was the first German navy to sail under the black-red-gold flag. Founded on 14 June 1848 by the orders of the democratically elected Frankfurt Parliament, the &quot;Reichsflotte&quot;&#x27;s brief existence ended with the failure of the revolution and it was disbanded on 2 April 1852; thus, the modern day navy celebrates its birthday on 14 June.

The small Prussian Navy evolved in 1867 into the North German Federal Navy, which was mainly for coast defence. It became the Imperial German Navy in 1871. From 1919 to 1935, only a small &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; was permitted. Under Nazi Germany, it was transformed into the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, which was disbanded in 1945 after the end of World War II in Europe.

Between May 1945 and 1956, the German Mine Sweeping Administration and its successor organizations, made up of former &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; members, became something of a transition stage for the German navy, allowing the future &quot;Marine&quot; to draw on recently experienced personnel upon its formation. Also, from 1949 to 1952 the United States Navy maintained the Naval Historical Team in Bremerhaven. This group of former &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; officers acting as historical and tactical consultants to the Americans, was significant in establishing a German element in the NATO senior naval staff. In 1956, with West Germany&#x27;s accession to NATO, the &quot;Bundesmarine&quot; (Federal Navy), as the navy was known colloquially, was formally established. In the same year the East German &quot;Volkspolizei See&quot; (literally People&#x27;s Police Sea) became the &quot;Volksmarine&quot; (People&#x27;s Navy). During the Cold War all of the German Navy&#x27;s combat vessels were assigned to NATO&#x27;s Allied Forces Baltic Approaches&#x27;s naval command NAVBALTAP.

With the accession of former East Germany&#x27;s states to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1990 the &quot;Volksmarine&quot; along with the whole National People&#x27;s Army became part of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;. Since 1995 the name &quot;German Navy&quot; is used in international context, while the official name since 1956 remains &quot;Marine&quot; without any additions. As of August 2024, the strength of the navy is 15,531 men and women.

A number of naval forces have operated in different periods. See
* &quot;Preußische Marine&quot; (Prussian Navy), 1701–1867
* &quot;Reichsflotte&quot; (Fleet of the Realm), 1848–52
* North German Federal Navy, 1867–71
* Imperial German Navy (&quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot;), 1871–1919
* &quot;Reichsmarine&quot;, 1919–35
* &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, 1935–45
* German Mine Sweeping Administration, 1945–48
* &quot;Volksmarine&quot;, the navy of East Germany (GDR) 1956–90
* &quot;Marine&quot;, 1956–present (&quot;Bundesmarine&quot;, colloquially)

==Current operations==
German warships permanently participate in all four NATO Maritime Groups. The German Navy is also engaged in operations against international terrorism such as Operation Enduring Freedom and NATO Operation Active Endeavour.

Presently the largest operation the German Navy is participating in is UNIFIL off the coast of Lebanon. The German contribution to this operation is two frigates, four fast attack craft, and two auxiliary vessels. The naval component of UNIFIL has been under German command.

The navy operates a number of development and testing installations as part of an inter-service and international network. Among these is the Centre of Excellence for Operations in Confined and Shallow Waters (COE CSW), an affiliated centre of Allied Command Transformation. The COE CSW was established in April 2007 and officially accredited by NATO on 26 May 2009. It is co-located with the staff of the German Flotilla 1 in Kiel whose Commander is double-hatted as Director, COE CSW.

==Equipment==
===Ships and submarines===

In total, there are about 65 commissioned ships in the German Navy, including; 11 frigates, 5 corvettes, 2 minesweepers, 10 minehunters, 6 submarines, 11 replenishment ships and 20 miscellaneous auxiliary vessels. The displacement of the navy is 220,000 tonnes.

Ships of the German Navy include:

* 4 &quot;Baden-Württemberg&quot;-class frigates F125 
* 3 &quot;Sachsen&quot;-class frigates F124
* 4 &quot;Brandenburg&quot;-class frigates F123
* 5 &quot;K130 Braunschweig&quot; class corvettes (5 additional units in production, planned commissioning from 2025)
* 6 Type 212 submarines and additional 212 CD class submarines 
In addition, the German Navy and the Royal Danish Navy are in cooperation in the &quot;Ark Project&quot;. This agreement made the Ark Project responsible for the strategic sealift of German armed forces where the full-time charter of three roll-on-roll-off cargo and troop ships are ready for deployments. In addition, these ships are also kept available for the use of the other European NATO countries. The three vessels have a combined displacement of 60,000 tonnes.
Including these ships, the total ships&#x27; displacement available to the &quot;Deutsche Marine&quot; is 280,000 tonnes.

Procurement of joint support ships (either two JSS800 for an amphibious group of 800 soldiers, or three smaller JSS400), was planned during the 1995–2010 period but the programme appears now to have been abandoned, not having been mentioned in two recent defence reviews. The larger ships would have been tasked for strategic troop transport and amphibious operations, and were to displace 27,000 to 30,000 tons for 800 soldiers.

===Aircraft===
The naval air arm of the German Navy is called the &quot;Marinefliegerkommando&quot;. The &quot;Marinefliegerkommando&quot; operates 56 aircraft, in May 2021 it was announced that the German Navy intended to replace the P-3C aircraft with Boeing P-8 Poseidon MPA aircraft through a FMS agreement from 2025 onwards.

<doc id="12961" wikidata="Q1687864" url="?curid=12961" title="GÉANT">
<text>GÉANT (&quot;Gigabit European Academic Network&quot;) is the pan-European data network for the research and education community. It interconnects national research and education networks (NRENs) across Europe, enabling collaboration on projects ranging from biological science, to earth observation, to arts and culture. The GÉANT project combines a high-bandwidth, high-capacity 50,000 km network with a growing range of services. These allow researchers to collaborate, working together wherever they are located. Services include identity and trust, multi-domain monitoring perfSONAR MDM, dynamic circuits and roaming via the eduroam service.

Together with European NRENs, GÉANT connects 50 million users in over 10,000 institutions. Through links to research networks in other regions (such as Internet2 and ESnet in the US, AfricaConnect in Africa, TEIN in Asia-Pacific and RedCLARA in Latin America), GÉANT enables collaboration between researchers in over half the world&#x27;s countries.

Co-funded by the European Commission and Europe&#x27;s NRENs, the GÉANT network was built and is operated by the GÉANT Association. The GÉANT project is a collaboration between 38 partners.

==History==
The GÉANT project began in November 2000, entered full production operation in December 2001 (fully replacing a network called TEN-155). Originally due to finish in October 2004, it was subsequently extended until April 2005.

The second generation network, named GÉANT2, began in September 2004 and continued through 2009, growing the network to 30 national networks in 34 countries.

The next GÉANT project (GN3) began on 1 April 2009 and continued until April 2013. This was then superseded by the GN3plus project which was scheduled to run for two years. It is funded under the EC&#x27;s seventh research and development Research Framework Programme (often referred to as FP7).

This was followed by the GN4 series of projects (GN4-1, GN4-2, and GN4-3) funded within the seven-year Horizon 2020 Framework Partnership Agreement (FPA). 

The project is now in its fifth iteration (GN5) funded under the seven-year Horizon Europe FPA. GN5-1 ran from January 2023 to December 2024. GN5-2, the current project, started in January 2025. 

==Technology==
As well as providing the high-bandwidth links across Europe, the GÉANT network also acts as a testbed for new technology.

It was the first &quot;hybrid&quot; network deployed on an international scale, combining routed IP and switched infrastructure. This enables the network to offer general traffic alongside virtual &quot;private&quot; network paths for projects, such as the Large Hadron Collider, which have particular requirements involving dedicated bandwidth, security and flexibility.

GÉANT supported native IPv6 since 2002 and multicast IPv6 since 2004. It is involved in network research, in areas such as carrier class network technologies, photonic switching, federated network architectures and virtualisation.

In 2013 a substantial network migration program was completed, meaning users could be offered multiple 100 Gbit/s links, with the core network supporting 500 Gbit/s and a network design that will support up to 8 Tbit/s.

Already, over 1 Petabyte of data are transferred every day via the GÉANT backbone network.

==Participants==
The GÉANT project is a collaboration between 50 partners: 37 European NREN, IUCC (representing Israel), NORDUnet (representing the five Nordic countries), and 11 associate members. 

The full list of NREN project partners are available on the website.

==Global links==
GÉANT links to research networks in other world regions, including:
* North America (Internet2, ESnet, NISN and CANARIE)
* Latin America
* North Africa and the Middle East
* South Africa/Kenya
* The South Caucasus
* Central Asia
* Asia Pacific

These links not only help international research collaboration but also aid with projects that deliver societal benefit, such as e-health, telemedicine and weather forecasting/disaster warning systems. Allowing researchers to work within their own countries also stems migration from less developed countries, helping bridge the digital divide.

==Example projects==
GÉANT is used by research communities, such as:
* High-energy physics
* Bio-medical sciences
* Health
* Radio Astronomy
* Earth Observation and Early Warning
* Arts and culture

<doc id="12962" wikidata="Q207920" url="?curid=12962" title="Γ-Hydroxybutyric acid">
<text>γ-Hydroxybutyric acid, also known as &quot;gamma&quot;-hydroxybutyric acid, GHB, or 4-hydroxybutanoic acid, is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter and a depressant drug. It is a precursor to GABA, glutamate, and glycine in certain brain areas. It acts on the GHB receptor and is a weak agonist at the GABAB receptor. GHB has been used in the medical setting as a general anesthetic and as treatment for cataplexy, narcolepsy, and alcoholism. The substance is also used illicitly for various reasons, including as a performance-enhancing drug, date rape drug, and as a recreational drug.

It is commonly used in the form of a salt, such as sodium γ-hydroxybutyrate (NaGHB, sodium oxybate, or Xyrem) or potassium γ-hydroxybutyrate (KGHB, potassium oxybate). GHB is also produced as a result of fermentation, and is found in small quantities in some beers and wines, beef, and small citrus fruits.

Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a disease that causes GHB to accumulate in the blood.

==Medical use==

GHB is used for medical purposes in the treatment of narcolepsy and, more rarely, alcohol dependence, although there remains uncertainty about its efficacy relative to other pharmacotherapies for alcohol dependence. The authors of a 2010 Cochrane review concluded that &quot;GHB appears better than NTX and disulfiram in maintaining abstinence and preventing craving in the medium term (3 to 12 months)&quot;. It is sometimes used off-label for the treatment of fibromyalgia. GHB is the active ingredient of the prescription medication sodium oxybate (Xyrem). Sodium oxybate is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cataplexy associated with narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with narcolepsy.

GHB has been shown to reliably increase slow-wave sleep and decrease the tendency for REM sleep in modified multiple sleep latency tests.

The FDA-approved labeling for sodium oxybate suggests no evidence GHB has teratogenic, carcinogenic or hepatotoxic properties. Its favorable safety profile relative to ethanol may explain why GHB continues to be investigated as a candidate for alcohol substitution.

==Recreational use==

GHB is a central nervous system depressant used as an intoxicant. It has many street names. Its effects have been described as comparable with ethanol (alcohol) and MDMA use, such as euphoria, disinhibition, enhanced libido and empathogenic states. A review comparing ethanol to GHB concluded that the dangers of the two drugs were similar. At higher doses, GHB may induce nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, agitation, visual disturbances, depressed breathing, amnesia, unconsciousness, and death. One potential cause of death from GHB consumption is polydrug toxicity. Co-administration with other CNS depressants such as alcohol or benzodiazepines can result in an additive effect (potentiation), as they all bind to gamma-aminobutyric acid (or &quot;GABA&quot;) receptor sites. The effects of GHB can last from 1.5 to 4 hours, or longer if large doses have been consumed. Consuming GHB with alcohol can cause respiratory arrest and vomiting in combination with unarousable sleep, which can lead to death.

Recreational doses of 1–2 g generally provide a feeling of euphoria, and larger doses create deleterious effects such as reduced motor function and drowsiness. The sodium salt of GHB has a salty taste. Other salt forms such as calcium GHB and magnesium GHB have also been reported, but the sodium salt is by far the most common.

Some prodrugs, such as γ-butyrolactone (GBL), convert to GHB in the stomach and bloodstream. Other prodrugs exist, such as 1,4-butanediol (1,4-B). GBL and 1,4-B are normally found as pure liquids, but they can be mixed with other more harmful solvents when intended for industrial use (e.g. as paint stripper or varnish thinner).

GHB can be manufactured with little knowledge of chemistry, as it involves the mixing of its two precursors, GBL and an alkali hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide, to form the GHB salt. Due to the ease of manufacture and the availability of its precursors, it is not usually produced in illicit laboratories like other synthetic drugs, but in private homes by low-level producers.

GHB is colourless and odourless.

=== Party use ===
GHB has been used as a club drug, apparently starting in the 1990s, as small doses of GHB can act as a euphoriant and are believed to be aphrodisiac. Slang terms for GHB include &quot;liquid ecstasy&quot;, &quot;lollipops&quot;, &quot;liquid X&quot; or &quot;liquid E&quot; due to its tendency to produce euphoria and sociability and its use in the dance party scene.

===Sports and athletics===
Some athletes have been know to use GHB, or its analogs, due to marketing claims the drug as an anabolic agent. However, no such evidence exists to suggest links between the use of GHB and muscle development or performance improvement.

==Usage as a date-rape drug==
GHB became known to the general public as a date-rape drug by the late 1990s. GHB is colourless and odorless and has been described as &quot;very easy to add to drinks&quot;. When consumed, the victim will quickly feel groggy and sleepy and may become unconscious. Upon recovery they may have an impaired ability to recall events that have occurred during the period of intoxication. In these situations evidence and the identification of the perpetrator of the rape is often difficult.

It is also difficult to establish how often GHB is used to facilitate rape as it is difficult to detect in a urine sample after a day, and many victims may only recall the rape some time after its occurrence; however, a 2006 study suggested that there was &quot;no evidence to suggest widespread date rape drug use&quot; in the UK, and that less than 2% of cases involved GHB, while 17% involved cocaine, and a survey in the Netherlands published in 2010 found that the proportion of drug-related rapes where GHB was used appeared to be greatly overestimated by the media. More recently, a study in Western Australia reviewed the pre-hospital context given in medical records around emergency department presentations with analytical confirmation of GHB exposure. This study found that most cases reported daily dosing and subsequent accidental overdose rather than their presentation being associated with date-rape.

There have been several high-profile cases of GHB as a date-rape drug that received national attention in the United States. In early 1999, a 15-year-old girl, Samantha Reid of Rockwood, Michigan, died from GHB poisoning. Reid&#x27;s death inspired the legislation titled the &quot;Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Drug Prohibition Act of 2000&quot;. This is the law that made GHB a Schedule 1 controlled substance. In the United Kingdom, British serial killer Stephen Port administered GHB to his victims by adding it to drinks given to them, raping them, and murdering four of them in his flat in Barking, East London.

GHB can be detected in hair. Hair testing can be a useful tool in court cases or for the victim&#x27;s own information. Most over-the-counter urine test kits test only for date-rape drugs that are benzodiazepines, which GHB is not. To detect GHB in urine, the sample must be taken within four hours of GHB ingestion, and cannot be tested at home.

==Adverse effects==
===Combination with alcohol===
In humans, GHB has been shown to reduce the elimination rate (thus increasing the elimination ) of alcohol. This may explain the respiratory arrest that has been reported after ingestion of both drugs. A review of the details of 194 deaths attributed to or related to GHB over a ten-year period found that most were from respiratory depression caused by interaction with alcohol or other drugs.

===Deaths===
One publication has investigated 226 deaths attributed to GHB. Of the 226 deaths included, 213 had a cardiorespiratory arrest and 13 had fatal accidents. Seventy-one of these deaths (34%) had no co-intoxicants. Postmortem blood GHB was 18–4400 mg/L (median=347) in deaths negative for co-intoxicants.

One report has suggested that sodium oxybate overdose might be fatal, based on deaths of three patients who had been prescribed the drug. However, for two of the three cases, post-mortem GHB concentrations were 141 and 110 mg/L, which is within the expected range of concentrations for GHB after death, and the third case was a patient with a history of intentional drug overdose. The toxicity of GHB has been an issue in criminal trials, as in the death of Felicia Tang, where the defense argued that death was due to GHB, not murder.

GHB is produced in the body in very small amounts, and blood levels may climb after death to levels in the range of 30–50 mg/L. Levels higher than this are found in GHB deaths. Levels lower than this may be due to GHB or to postmortem endogenous elevations.

===Neurotoxicity===
In multiple studies, GHB has been found to impair spatial memory, working memory, learning and memory in rats with chronic administration. These effects are associated with decreased NMDA receptor expression in the cerebral cortex and possibly other areas as well. In addition, the neurotoxicity appears to be caused by oxidative stress.

===Addiction===
Addiction occurs when repeated drug use disrupts the normal balance of brain circuits that control rewards, memory and cognition, ultimately leading to compulsive drug taking.

Rats forced to consume massive doses of GHB will intermittently prefer GHB solution to water.

===Withdrawal===
GHB has also been associated with a withdrawal syndrome of insomnia, anxiety, and tremor that usually resolves within three to twenty-one days. The withdrawal syndrome can be severe producing acute delirium and may require hospitalization in an intensive care unit for management. Management of GHB dependence involves considering the person&#x27;s age, comorbidity and the pharmacological pathways of GHB. The mainstay of treatment for severe withdrawal is supportive care and benzodiazepines for control of acute delirium, but larger doses are often required compared to acute delirium of other causes (e.g. &gt; 100 mg/d of diazepam). Baclofen has been suggested as an alternative or adjunct to benzodiazepines based on anecdotal evidence and some animal data. However, there is less experience with the use of baclofen for GHB withdrawal, and additional research in humans is needed. Baclofen was first suggested as an adjunct because benzodiazepines do not affect GABAB receptors and therefore have no cross-tolerance with GHB while baclofen, which works via GABAB receptors, is cross-tolerant with GHB and may be more effective in alleviating withdrawal effects of GHB.

GHB withdrawal is not widely discussed in textbooks and some psychiatrists, general practitioners, and even hospital emergency physicians may not be familiar with this withdrawal syndrome.

==Overdose==
Overdose of GHB can sometimes be difficult to treat because of its multiple effects on the body. GHB tends to cause rapid unconsciousness at doses above 3500 mg, with single doses over 7000 mg often causing life-threatening respiratory depression, and higher doses still inducing bradycardia and cardiac arrest. Other side-effects include convulsions (especially when combined with stimulants), and nausea/vomiting (especially when combined with alcohol).

The greatest life threat due to GHB overdose (with or without other substances) is respiratory arrest. Other relatively common causes of death due to GHB ingestion include aspiration of vomitus, positional asphyxia, and trauma sustained while intoxicated (e.g., motor vehicle accidents while driving under the influence of GHB). The risk of aspiration pneumonia and positional asphyxia risk can be reduced by laying the patient down in the recovery position. People are most likely to vomit as they become unconscious, and as they wake up. It is important to keep the victim awake and moving; the victim must not be left alone due to the risk of death through vomiting. Frequently the victim will be in a good mood but this does not mean the victim is not in danger. GHB overdose is a medical emergency and immediate assessment in an emergency department is needed.

Convulsions from GHB can be treated with the benzodiazepines diazepam or lorazepam. Even though these benzodiazepines are also CNS depressants, they primarily modulate GABAA receptors whereas GHB is primarily a GABAB receptor agonist, and so do not worsen CNS depression as much as might be expected.

Because of the faster and more complete absorption of GBL relative to GHB, its dose-response curve is steeper, and overdoses of GBL tend to be more dangerous and problematic than overdoses involving only GHB or 1,4-B. Any GHB/GBL overdose is a medical emergency and should be cared for by appropriately trained personnel.

A newer synthetic drug, SCH-50911, which acts as a selective GABAB antagonist, quickly reverses GHB overdose in mice. However, this treatment has yet to be tried in humans, and it is unlikely that it will be researched for this purpose in humans due to the illegal nature of clinical trials of GHB and the lack of medical indemnity coverage inherent in using an untested treatment for a life-threatening overdose.

===Detection of use===
GHB may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, to provide evidence in an impaired driving, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma GHB concentrations are usually in a range of 50–250 mg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically (during general anesthesia), 30–100 mg/L in those arrested for impaired driving, 50–500 mg/L in acutely intoxicated patients and 100–1000 mg/L in victims of fatal overdosage. Urine is often the preferred specimen for routine drug abuse monitoring purposes. Both γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4-butanediol are converted to GHB in the body.

In January 2016, it was announced scientists had developed a way to detect GHB, among other things, in saliva.

==Endogenous production==
Cells produce GHB by reduction of succinic semialdehyde via succinic semialdehyde reductase (SSR). This enzyme appears to be induced by cAMP levels, meaning substances that elevate cAMP, such as forskolin and vinpocetine, may increase GHB synthesis and release. Conversely, endogeneous GHB production in those taking valproic acid will be inhibited via inhibition of the conversion from succinic acid semialdehyde to GHB. People with the disorder known as succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, also known as γ-hydroxybutyric aciduria, have elevated levels of GHB in their urine, blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.

The precise function of GHB in the body is not clear. It is known, however, that the brain expresses a large number of receptors that are activated by GHB. These receptors are excitatory, however, and therefore not responsible for the sedative effects of GHB; they have been shown to elevate the principal excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate. The benzamide antipsychotics—amisulpride, nemonapride, etc.—have been shown to bind to these GHB-activated receptors in vivo. Other antipsychotics were tested and were not found to have an affinity for this receptor.

GHB is a precursor to GABA, glutamate, and glycine in certain brain areas.

In spite of its demonstrated neurotoxicity, (see relevant section, above), GHB has neuroprotective properties, and has been found to protect cells from hypoxia.

==Natural fermentation by-product==
GHB is also produced as a result of fermentation and so is found in small quantities in some beers and wines, in particular fruit wines. The amount found in wine is pharmacologically insignificant and not sufficient to produce psychoactive effects.

==Pharmacology==
GHB has at least two distinct binding sites in the central nervous system. GHB acts as an agonist at the inhibitory GHB receptor and as a weak agonist at the inhibitory GABAB receptor. GHB is a naturally occurring substance that acts in a similar fashion to some neurotransmitters in the mammalian brain. GHB is probably synthesized from GABA in GABAergic neurons, and released when the neurons fire.

GHB has been found to activate oxytocinergic neurons in the supraoptic nucleus.

If taken orally, GABA itself does not effectively cross the blood–brain barrier.

GHB induces the accumulation of either a derivative of tryptophan or tryptophan itself in the extracellular space, possibly by increasing tryptophan transport across the blood–brain barrier. The blood content of certain neutral amino-acids, including tryptophan, is also increased by peripheral GHB administration. GHB-induced stimulation of tissue serotonin turnover may be due to an increase in tryptophan transport to the brain and in its uptake by serotonergic cells. As the serotonergic system may be involved in the regulation of sleep, mood, and anxiety, the stimulation of this system by high doses of GHB may be involved in certain neuropharmacological events induced by GHB administration.

However, at therapeutic doses, GHB reaches much higher concentrations in the brain and activates GABAB receptors, which are primarily responsible for its sedative effects. GHB&#x27;s sedative effects are blocked by GABAB antagonists.

The role of the GHB receptor in the behavioural effects induced by GHB is more complex. GHB receptors are densely expressed in many areas of the brain, including the cortex and hippocampus, and these are the receptors that GHB displays the highest affinity for. There has been somewhat limited research into the GHB receptor; however, there is evidence that activation of the GHB receptor in some brain areas results in the release of glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter. Drugs that selectively activate the GHB receptor cause absence seizures in high doses, as do GHB and GABAB agonists.

Activation of both the GHB receptor and GABAB is responsible for the addictive profile of GHB. GHB&#x27;s effect on dopamine release is biphasic. Low concentrations stimulate dopamine release via the GHB receptor. Higher concentrations inhibit dopamine release via GABAB receptors as do other GABAB agonists such as baclofen and phenibut. After an initial phase of inhibition, dopamine release is then increased via the GHB receptor. Both the inhibition and increase of dopamine release by GHB are inhibited by opioid antagonists such as naloxone and naltrexone. Dynorphin may play a role in the inhibition of dopamine release via kappa opioid receptors.

This explains the paradoxical mix of sedative and stimulatory properties of GHB, as well as the so-called &quot;rebound&quot; effect, experienced by individuals using GHB as a sleeping agent, wherein they awake suddenly after several hours of GHB-induced deep sleep. That is to say that, over time, the concentration of GHB in the system decreases below the threshold for significant GABAB receptor activation and activates predominantly the GHB receptor, leading to wakefulness.

Recently, analogs of GHB, such as 4-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic acid (UMB68) have been synthesised and tested on animals, in order to gain a better understanding of GHB&#x27;s mode of action. Analogues of GHB such as 3-methyl-GHB, 4-methyl-GHB, and 4-phenyl-GHB have been shown to produce similar effects to GHB in some animal studies, but these compounds are even less well researched than GHB itself. Of these analogues, only 4-methyl-GHB (γ-hydroxyvaleric acid, GHV) and a prodrug form γ-valerolactone (GVL) have been reported as drugs of abuse in humans, and on the available evidence seem to be less potent but more toxic than GHB, with a particular tendency to cause nausea and vomiting.

Other prodrug ester forms of GHB have also rarely been encountered by law enforcement, including 1,4-butanediol diacetate (BDDA/DABD), methyl-4-acetoxybutanoate (MAB), and ethyl-4-acetoxybutanoate (EAB), but these are, in general, covered by analogue laws in jurisdictions where GHB is illegal, and little is known about them beyond their delayed onset and longer duration of action. The intermediate compound γ-hydroxybutyraldehyde (GHBAL) is also a prodrug for GHB; however, as with all aliphatic aldehydes this compound is caustic and is strong-smelling and foul-tasting; actual use of this compound as an intoxicant is likely to be unpleasant and result in severe nausea and vomiting.

Only a minor portion (1–5%) of the administered GHB dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Studies have shown that the maximum concentration of GHB in urine appears within 1 hour and rapidly declines thereafter. The vast majority (95–98%) undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver. GHB is broken down through a series of enzymatic pathways. The primary route involves conversion to succinic semialdehyde (SSA) by either GHB dehydrogenase (ADH) or GHB transhydrogenase. SSA is further oxidized by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) to succinic acid, which enters the Krebs cycle and is ultimately converted into carbon dioxide and water.

Both of the metabolic breakdown pathways shown for GHB can run in either direction, depending on the concentrations of the substances involved, so the body can make its own GHB either from GABA or from succinic semialdehyde. Under normal physiological conditions, the concentration of GHB in the body is rather low, and the pathways would run in the reverse direction to what is shown here to produce endogenous GHB. However, when GHB is consumed for recreational or health promotion purposes, its concentration in the body is much higher than normal, which changes the enzyme kinetics so that these pathways operate to metabolise GHB rather than producing it.

==History==
Alexander Zaytsev worked on this chemical family and published work on it in 1874. The first extended research into GHB and its use in humans was conducted in the early 1960s by Henri Laborit to use in studying the neurotransmitter GABA. It was studied in a range of uses including obstetric surgery and during childbirth and as an anxiolytic; there were anecdotal reports of it having antidepressant and aphrodisiac effects as well. It was also studied as an intravenous anesthetic agent and was marketed for that purpose starting in 1964 in Europe but it was not widely adopted as it caused seizures; as of 2006 that use was still authorized in France and Italy but not widely used. It was also studied to treat alcohol addiction; while the evidence for this use is weak; however, sodium oxybate is marketed for this use in Italy.

GHB and sodium oxybate were also studied for use in narcolepsy from the 1960s onwards.

In May 1990 GHB was introduced as a dietary supplement and was marketed to body builders, for help with weight control and as a sleep aid, and as a &quot;replacement&quot; for l-tryptophan, which was removed from the market in November 1989 when batches contaminated with trace impurities were found to cause eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome, although eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome is also tied to tryptophan overload. In 2001 tryptophan supplement sales were allowed to resume, and in 2005 the FDA ban on tryptophan supplement importation was lifted. By November 1989 57 cases of illness caused by the GHB supplements had been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with people having taken up to three teaspoons of GHB; there were no deaths but nine people needed care in an intensive care unit. The FDA issued a warning in November 1990 that sale of GHB was illegal. GHB continued to be manufactured and sold illegally and it and analogs were adopted as a club drug and came to be used as a date rape drug, and the DEA made seizures and the FDA reissued warnings several times throughout the 1990s.

At the same time, research on the use of GHB in the form of sodium oxybate had formalized, as a company called Orphan Medical had filed an investigational new drug application and was running clinical trials with the intention of gaining regulatory approval for use to treat narcolepsy.

A popular children&#x27;s toy, Bindeez (also known as Aqua Dots, in the United States), produced by Melbourne company Moose, was banned in Australia in early November 2007 when it was discovered that 1,4-butanediol (1,4-B), which is metabolized into GHB, had been substituted for the non-toxic plasticiser 1,5-pentanediol in the bead manufacturing process. Three young children were hospitalized as a result of ingesting a large number of the beads, and the toy was recalled.

&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;

== Legal status ==
In the United States, GHB was placed on Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act in March 2000. However, used in sodium oxybate under an IND or NDA from the US FDA, it is considered a Schedule III substance but with Schedule I trafficking penalties, one of several drugs that are listed in multiple schedules.

On 20 March 2001, the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs placed GHB in Schedule IV of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

In the UK GHB was made a class C drug in June 2003. In October 2013 the ACMD recommended upgrading it from schedule IV to schedule II in line with UN recommendations. Their report concluded that the minimal use of Xyrem in the UK meant that prescribers would be minimally inconvenienced by the rescheduling. This advice was followed and GHB was moved to schedule 2 on 7 January 2015. In April 2022 GHB was changed from class C to class B.

In Hong Kong, GHB is regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong&#x27;s Chapter 134 &quot;Dangerous Drugs Ordinance&quot;. It can only be used legally by health professionals and for university research purposes. The substance can be given by pharmacists under a prescription. Anyone who supplies the substance without prescription can be fined HK$10,000. The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a HK$150,000 fine and life imprisonment. Possession of the substance for consumption without license from the Department of Health is illegal with a HK$100,000 fine or five years of jail time.

In Canada, GHB has been a Schedule I controlled substance since 6 November 2012 (the same schedule that contains heroin and cocaine). Prior to that date, it was a Schedule III controlled substance (the same schedule that contains amphetamines and LSD).

In New Zealand and Australia, GHB, 1,4-B, and GBL are all Class B illegal drugs, along with any possible esters, ethers, and aldehydes. GABA itself is also listed as an illegal drug in these jurisdictions, which seems unusual given its failure to cross the blood–brain barrier, but there was a perception among legislators that all known analogues should be covered as far as this was possible. Attempts to circumvent the illegal status of GHB have led to the sale of derivatives such as 4-methyl-GHB (γ-hydroxyvaleric acid, GHV) and its prodrug form γ-valerolactone (GVL), but these are also covered under the law by virtue of their being &quot;substantially similar&quot; to GHB or GBL, so importation, sale, possession and use of these compounds is also considered to be illegal.

In Chile, GHB is a controlled drug under the law (psychotropic substances and narcotics).

In Norway and in Switzerland, GHB is considered a narcotic and is only available by prescription under the trade name Xyrem (Union Chimique Belge S.A.).

Sodium oxybate is also used therapeutically in Italy under the brand name Alcover for treatment of alcohol withdrawal and dependence.

<doc id="12963" wikidata="Q36330" url="?curid=12963" title="Giordano Bruno">
<text>Giordano Bruno ( , ; ; born Filippo Bruno; January or February 1548 – 17 February 1600) was an Italian philosopher, poet, alchemist, astrologer, cosmological theorist, and esotericist. He is known for his cosmological theories, which conceptually extended to include the then-novel Copernican model. He practiced Hermeticism and gave a mystical stance to exploring the universe. He proposed that the stars were distant suns surrounded by their own planets (exoplanets), and he raised the possibility that these planets might foster life of their own, a cosmological position known as cosmic pluralism. He also insisted that the universe is infinite and could have no center.

Bruno was tried for heresy by the Roman Inquisition on charges of denial of several core Catholic doctrines, including eternal damnation, the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, the virginity of Mary, and transubstantiation. Bruno&#x27;s pantheism was not taken lightly by the church, nor was his teaching of metempsychosis regarding the reincarnation of the soul. The Inquisition found him guilty, and he was burned at the stake in Rome&#x27;s Campo de&#x27; Fiori in 1600. After his death, he gained considerable fame, being particularly celebrated by 19th- and early 20th-century commentators who regarded him as a martyr for science. Some historians are of the opinion his heresy trial was not a response to his cosmological views but rather a response to his religious and afterlife views, while others find the main reason for Bruno&#x27;s death was indeed his cosmological views. Bruno&#x27;s case is still considered a landmark in the history of free thought and the emerging sciences.

In addition to cosmology, Bruno also wrote extensively on the art of memory, a loosely organized group of mnemonic techniques and principles. Historian Frances Yates argues that Bruno was deeply influenced by the presocratic Empedocles, Neoplatonism, Renaissance Hermeticism, and Book of Genesis-like legends surrounding the Hellenistic conception of Hermes Trismegistus. Other studies of Bruno have focused on his qualitative approach to mathematics and his application of the spatial concepts of geometry to language.

==Life==
===Early years, 1548–1576===
Born Filippo Bruno in Nola (a &quot;comune&quot; in the modern-day province of Naples, in the Southern Italian region of Campania, then part of the Kingdom of Naples) in 1548, he was the son of Giovanni Bruno (1517 – c. 1592), a soldier, and Fraulissa Savolino (1520–?). In his youth he was sent to Naples to be educated. He was tutored privately at the Augustinian monastery there, and attended public lectures at the Studium Generale. At the age of 17, he entered the Dominican Order at the monastery of San Domenico Maggiore in Naples, taking the name Giordano, after Giordano Crispo, his metaphysics tutor. He continued his studies there, completing his novitiate, and ordained a priest in 1572 at age 24. During his time in Naples, he became known for his skill with the art of memory and on one occasion traveled to Rome to demonstrate his mnemonic system before Pope Pius V and Cardinal Rebiba. In his later years, Bruno claimed that the Pope accepted his dedication to him of the lost work &quot;On The Ark of Noah&quot; at this time.

While Bruno was distinguished for outstanding ability, his taste for free thinking and forbidden books soon caused him difficulties. Given the controversy he caused in later life, it is surprising that he was able to remain within the monastic system for eleven years. In his testimony to Venetian inquisitors during his trial many years later, he says that proceedings were twice taken against him for having cast away images of the saints, retaining only a crucifix, and for having recommended controversial texts to a novice. Such behavior could perhaps be overlooked, but Bruno&#x27;s situation became much more serious when he was reported to have defended the Arian heresy, and when a copy of the banned writings of Erasmus, annotated by him, was discovered hidden in the monastery latrine. When he learned that an indictment was being prepared against him in Naples he fled, shedding his religious habit, at least for a time.

===First years of wandering, 1576–1583===
Bruno first went to the Genoese port of Noli, then to Savona, Turin and finally to Venice, where he published his lost work &quot;On the Signs of the Times&quot; with the permission (so he claimed at his trial) of the Dominican Remigio Nannini Fiorentino. From Venice he went to Padua, where he met fellow Dominicans who convinced him to wear his religious habit again. From Padua he went to Bergamo and then across the Alps to Chambéry and Lyon. His movements after this time are obscure.

In 1579, Bruno arrived in Geneva. During his Venetian trial, he told inquisitors that while in Geneva he told the Marchese de Vico of Naples, who was notable for helping Italian refugees in Geneva, &quot;I did not intend to adopt the religion of the city. I desired to stay there only that I might live at liberty and in security.&quot; Bruno had a pair of breeches made for himself, and the Marchese and others apparently made Bruno a gift of a sword, hat, cape and other necessities for dressing himself; in such clothing Bruno could no longer be recognized as a priest. Things apparently went well for Bruno for a time, as he entered his name in the Rector&#x27;s Book of the University of Geneva in May 1579. But in keeping with his personality he could not long remain silent. In August he published an attack on the work of , a distinguished professor. Bruno and the printer, Jean Bergeon, were promptly arrested. Rather than apologizing, Bruno insisted on continuing to defend his publication. He was refused the right to take sacrament. Though this right was soon restored, he left Geneva.

He went to France, arriving first in Lyon, and thereafter settling for a time (1580–1581) in Toulouse, where he took his doctorate in theology and was elected by students to lecture in philosophy. He also attempted at this time to return to Catholicism, but was denied absolution by the Jesuit priest he approached. When religious strife broke out in the summer of 1581, he moved to Paris. There he held a cycle of thirty lectures on theological topics and also began to gain fame for his prodigious memory. His talents attracted the benevolent attention of the king Henry III; Bruno subsequently reported: &quot;I got me such a name that King Henry III summoned me one day to discover from me if the memory which I possessed was natural or acquired by magic art. I satisfied him that it did not come from sorcery but from organized knowledge; and, following this, I got a book on memory printed, entitled &quot;The Shadows of Ideas&quot;, which I dedicated to His Majesty. Forthwith he gave me an Extraordinary Lectureship with a salary.&quot;

In Paris, Bruno enjoyed the protection of his powerful French patrons. During this period, he published several works on mnemonics, including &quot;De umbris idearum&quot; (&quot;On the Shadows of Ideas&quot;, 1582), &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Art of Memory&quot;, 1582), and &quot;Cantus circaeus&quot; (&quot;Circe&#x27;s Song&quot;, 1582; described at ). All of these were based on his mnemonic models of organized knowledge and experience, as opposed to the simplistic logic-based mnemonic techniques of Petrus Ramus then becoming popular. Bruno also published a comedy summarizing some of his philosophical positions, titled &quot;Il Candelaio&quot; (&quot;The Candlemaker&quot;, 1582). In the 16th century dedications were, as a rule, approved beforehand, and hence were a way of placing a work under the protection of an individual. Given that Bruno dedicated various works to the likes of King Henry III, Sir Philip Sidney, Michel de Castelnau (French Ambassador to England), and possibly Pope Pius V, it is apparent that this wanderer had risen sharply in status and moved in powerful circles.

===England, 1583–1585===

In April 1583, Bruno went to England with letters of recommendation from Henry III as a guest of the French ambassador, Michel de Castelnau. Bruno lived at the French embassy with the lexicographer John Florio. There he became acquainted with the poet Philip Sidney (to whom he dedicated two books) and other members of the Hermetic circle around John Dee, though there is no evidence that Bruno ever met Dee himself. He also lectured at Oxford, and unsuccessfully sought a teaching position there. His views were controversial, notably with John Underhill, Rector of Lincoln College and subsequently bishop of Oxford, and George Abbot, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury. Abbot mocked Bruno for supporting &quot;the opinion of Copernicus that the earth did go round, and the heavens did stand still; whereas in truth it was his own head which rather did run round, and his brains did not stand still&quot;, and found Bruno had both plagiarized and misrepresented Ficino&#x27;s work, leading Bruno to return to the continent.

Nevertheless, his stay in England was fruitful. During that time Bruno completed and published some of his most important works, the six &quot;Italian Dialogues&quot;, including the cosmological tracts &quot;La cena de le ceneri&quot; (&quot;The Ash Wednesday Supper&quot;, 1584), &quot;De la causa, principio et uno&quot; (&quot;On Cause, Principle and Unity&quot;, 1584), &quot;De l&#x27;infinito, universo et mondi&quot; (&quot;On the Infinite, Universe and Worlds&quot;, 1584) as well as &quot;Lo spaccio de la bestia trionfante&quot; (&quot;The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast&quot;, 1584) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;On the Heroic Frenzies&quot;, 1585). Some of these were printed by John Charlewood. Some of the works that Bruno published in London, notably &quot;The Ash Wednesday Supper&quot;, appear to have given offense. Once again, Bruno&#x27;s controversial views and tactless language lost him the support of his friends. John Bossy has advanced the theory that, while staying in the French Embassy in London, Bruno was also spying on Catholic conspirators, under the pseudonym &quot;Henry Fagot&quot;, for Sir Francis Walsingham, Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Secretary of State.

Bruno is sometimes cited as being the first to propose that the universe is infinite, which he did during his time in England, but an English scientist, Thomas Digges, put forth this idea in a published work in 1576, some eight years earlier than Bruno. An infinite universe and the possibility of alien life had also been earlier suggested by German Catholic Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa in &quot;On Learned Ignorance&quot; published in 1440 and Bruno attributed his understanding of multiple worlds to this earlier scholar, who he called &quot;the divine Cusanus&quot;.

===Last years of wandering, 1585–1592===
In October 1585, Castelnau was recalled to France, and Bruno went with him. In Paris, Bruno found a tense political situation. Moreover, his 120 theses against Aristotelian natural science soon put him in ill favor. In 1586, following a violent quarrel over these theses, he left France for Germany.
In Germany he failed to obtain a teaching position at Marburg, but was granted permission to teach at Wittenberg, where he lectured on Aristotle for two years. However, with a change of intellectual climate there, he was no longer welcome, and went in 1588 to Prague, where he obtained 300 taler from Rudolf II, but no teaching position. He went on to serve briefly as a professor in Helmstedt, but had to flee again in 1590 when he was excommunicated by the Lutherans.

During this period he produced several Latin works, dictated to his friend and secretary Girolamo Besler, including &quot;De Magia&quot; (&quot;On Magic&quot;), &quot;Theses De Magia&quot; (&quot;Theses on Magic&quot;) and &quot;De Vinculis in Genere&quot; (&quot;A General Account of Bonding&quot;). All these were apparently transcribed or recorded by Besler (or Bisler) between 1589 and 1590. He also published &quot;De Imaginum, Signorum, Et Idearum Compositione&quot; (&quot;On the Composition of Images, Signs and Ideas&quot;, 1591).

In 1591 he was in Frankfurt, where he received an invitation from the Venetian patrician Giovanni Mocenigo, who wished to be instructed in the art of memory, and also heard of a vacant chair in mathematics at the University of Padua. At the time the Inquisition seemed to be losing some of its strictness, and because the Republic of Venice was the most liberal state in the Italian Peninsula, Bruno was lulled into making the fatal mistake of returning to Italy.

He went first to Padua, where he taught briefly, and applied unsuccessfully for the chair of mathematics, which was given instead to Galileo Galilei one year later. Bruno accepted Mocenigo&#x27;s invitation and moved to Venice in March 1592. For about two months he served as an in-house tutor to Mocenigo, to whom he let slip some of his heterodox ideas. Mocenigo denounced him to the Venetian Inquisition, which had Bruno arrested on 22 May 1592. Among the numerous charges of blasphemy and heresy brought against him in Venice, based on Mocenigo&#x27;s denunciation, was his belief in the plurality of worlds, as well as accusations of personal misconduct. Bruno defended himself skillfully, stressing the philosophical character of some of his positions, denying others and admitting that he had had doubts on some matters of dogma. The Roman Inquisition, however, asked for his transfer to Rome. After several months of argument, the Venetian authorities reluctantly consented and Bruno was sent to Rome in January 1593.

===Imprisonment, trial and execution, 1593–1600===
During the seven years of his trial in Rome, Bruno was held in confinement, lastly in the Tower of Nona. Some important documents about the trial are lost, but others have been preserved, among them a summary of the proceedings that was rediscovered in 1940. The numerous charges against Bruno, based on some of his books as well as on witness accounts, included blasphemy, immoral conduct, and heresy in matters of dogmatic theology, and involved some of the basic doctrines of his philosophy and cosmology. Luigi Firpo speculates the charges made against Bruno by the Roman Inquisition were:

* holding opinions contrary to the Catholic faith and speaking against it and its ministers;
* holding opinions contrary to the Catholic faith about the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, and the Incarnation;
* holding opinions contrary to the Catholic faith pertaining to Jesus as the Christ;
* holding opinions contrary to the Catholic faith regarding the virginity of Mary, mother of Jesus;
* holding opinions contrary to the Catholic faith about both Transubstantiation and the Mass;
* claiming the existence of a plurality of worlds and their eternity;
* believing in metempsychosis and in the transmigration of the human soul into brutes;
* dealing in magics and divination.
Bruno defended himself as he had in Venice, insisting that he accepted the Church&#x27;s dogmatic teachings, but trying to preserve the basis of his cosmological views. In particular, he held firm to his belief in the plurality of worlds, although he was admonished to abandon it. His trial was overseen by the Inquisitor Cardinal Bellarmine, who demanded a full recantation, which Bruno eventually refused. On 20 January 1600, Pope Clement VIII declared Bruno a heretic, and the Inquisition issued a sentence of death. According to the correspondence of Gaspar Schopp of Breslau, he is said to have made a threatening gesture towards his judges and to have replied: &quot;Maiori forsan cum timore sententiam in me fertis quam ego accipiam&quot; (&quot;Perhaps you pronounce this sentence against me with greater fear than I receive it&quot;).

He was turned over to the secular authorities. On 17 February 1600, in the Campo de&#x27; Fiori (a central Roman market square), naked, with his &quot;tongue imprisoned because of his wicked words&quot;, he was burned alive at the stake. His ashes were thrown into the Tiber river.

All of Bruno&#x27;s works were placed on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; in 1603. The inquisition cardinals who judged Giordano Bruno were Cardinal Bellarmino (Bellarmine), Cardinal Madruzzo (Madruzzi), Camillo Cardinal Borghese (later Pope Paul V), Domenico Cardinal Pinelli, Pompeio Cardinal Arrigoni, Cardinal Sfondrati, Pedro Cardinal De Deza Manuel and Cardinal Santorio (Archbishop of Santa Severina, Cardinal-Bishop of Palestrina).

The measures taken to prevent Bruno continuing to speak have resulted in his becoming a symbol for free thought and free speech in present-day Rome, where an annual memorial service takes place close to the spot where he was executed.

===Physical appearance===
The earliest likeness of Bruno is an engraving published in 1715 and cited by Salvestrini as &quot;the only known portrait of Bruno&quot;. Salvestrini suggests that it is a re-engraving made from a now lost original. This engraving has provided the source for later images.

The records of Bruno&#x27;s imprisonment by the Venetian inquisition in May 1592 describe him as a man &quot;of average height, with a hazel-coloured beard and the appearance of being about forty years of age&quot;. Alternately, a passage in a work by George Abbot indicates that Bruno was of diminutive stature: &quot;When that Italian Didapper, who intituled himself Philotheus Iordanus Brunus Nolanus, magis elaboratae Theologiae Doctor, &amp;c. with a name longer than his body...&quot;.

==Cosmology==
===Contemporary cosmological beliefs===
In the first half of the 15th century, Nicholas of Cusa challenged the then widely accepted philosophies of Aristotelianism, envisioning instead an infinite universe whose center was everywhere and circumference nowhere, and moreover teeming with countless stars. He also predicted that neither were the rotational orbits circular nor were their movements uniform.

In the second half of the 16th century, the theories of Copernicus (1473–1543) began diffusing through Europe. Copernicus conserved the idea of planets fixed to solid spheres, but considered the apparent motion of the stars to be an illusion caused by the rotation of the Earth on its axis; he also preserved the notion of an immobile center, but it was the Sun rather than the Earth. Copernicus also argued the Earth was a planet orbiting the Sun once every year. However he maintained the Ptolemaic hypothesis that the orbits of the planets were composed of perfect circles—deferents and epicycles—and that the stars were fixed on a stationary outer sphere.

Despite the widespread publication of Copernicus&#x27; work &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot;, during Bruno&#x27;s time most educated Catholics subscribed to the Aristotelian geocentric view that the Earth was the center of the universe, and that all heavenly bodies revolved around it. The ultimate limit of the universe was the &quot;primum mobile&quot;, whose diurnal rotation was conferred upon it by a transcendental God, not part of the universe (although, as the kingdom of heaven, adjacent to it), a motionless prime mover and first cause. The fixed stars were part of this celestial sphere, all at the same fixed distance from the immobile Earth at the center of the sphere. Ptolemy had numbered these at 1,022, grouped into 48 constellations. The planets were each fixed to a transparent sphere.

Few astronomers of Bruno&#x27;s time accepted Copernicus&#x27;s heliocentric model. Among those who did were the Germans Michael Maestlin (1550–1631), Christoph Rothmann, Johannes Kepler (1571–1630); the Englishman Thomas Digges (c. 1546–1595), author of &quot;A Perfit Description of the Caelestial Orbes&quot;; and the Italian Galileo Galilei (1564–1642).

===Cosmological claims===

In 1584, Bruno published two important philosophical dialogues (&quot;La Cena de le Ceneri&quot; and &quot;De l&#x27;infinito universo et mondi&quot;) in which he argued against the planetary spheres (Christoph Rothmann did the same in 1586 as did Tycho Brahe in 1587) and affirmed the Copernican principle.

In particular, to support the Copernican view and oppose the objection according to which the motion of the Earth would be perceived by means of the motion of winds, clouds etc., in &quot;La Cena de le Ceneri&quot; Bruno anticipates some of the arguments of Galilei on the relativity principle. Note that he also uses the example now known as Galileo&#x27;s ship.

Theophilus – [...] air through which the clouds and winds move are parts of the Earth, [...] to mean under the name of Earth the whole machinery and the entire animated part, which consists of dissimilar parts; so that the rivers, the rocks, the seas, the whole vaporous and turbulent air, which is enclosed within the highest mountains, should belong to the Earth as its members, just as the air [does] in the lungs and in other cavities of animals by which they breathe, widen their arteries, and other similar effects necessary for life are performed. The clouds, too, move through accidents in the body of the Earth and are in its bowels as are the waters. [...] With the Earth move [...] all things that are on the Earth. If, therefore, from a point outside the Earth something were thrown upon the Earth, it would lose, because of the latter&#x27;s motion, its straightness as would be seen on the ship [...] moving along a river, if someone on point C of the riverbank were to throw a stone along a straight line, and would see the stone miss its target by the amount of the velocity of the ship&#x27;s motion. But if someone were placed high on the mast of that ship, move as it may however fast, he would not miss his target at all, so that the stone or some other heavy thing thrown downward would not come along a straight line from the point E which is at the top of the mast, or cage, to the point D which is at the bottom of the mast, or at some point in the bowels and body of the ship. Thus, if from the point D to the point E someone who is inside the ship would throw a stone straight up, it would return to the bottom along the same line however far the ship moved, provided it was not subject to any pitch and roll.&quot;

Bruno&#x27;s infinite universe was filled with a substance—a &quot;pure air&quot;, aether, or &quot;spiritus&quot;—that offered no resistance to the heavenly bodies which, in Bruno&#x27;s view, rather than being fixed, moved under their own impetus (momentum). Most dramatically, he completely abandoned the idea of a hierarchical universe.

The universe is then one, infinite, immobile... It is not capable of comprehension and therefore is endless and limitless, and to that extent infinite and indeterminable, and consequently immobile.

Bruno&#x27;s cosmology distinguishes between &quot;suns&quot; which produce their own light and heat, and have other bodies moving around them; and &quot;earths&quot; which move around suns and receive light and heat from them. Bruno suggested that some, if not all, of the objects classically known as fixed stars are in fact suns. According to astrophysicist Steven Soter, he was the first person to grasp that &quot;stars are other suns with their own planets.&quot;

Bruno wrote that other worlds &quot;have no less virtue nor a nature different from that of our Earth&quot; and, like Earth, &quot;contain animals and inhabitants&quot;.

During the late 16th century, and throughout the 17th century, Bruno&#x27;s ideas were held up for ridicule, debate, or inspiration. Margaret Cavendish, for example, wrote an entire series of poems against &quot;atoms&quot; and &quot;infinite worlds&quot; in &quot;Poems and Fancies&quot; in 1664. Bruno&#x27;s true, if partial, vindication would have to wait for the implications and impact of Newtonian cosmology.

Bruno&#x27;s overall contribution to the birth of modern science is still controversial. Some scholars follow Frances Yates in stressing the importance of Bruno&#x27;s ideas about the universe being infinite and lacking geocentric structure as a crucial crossing point between the old and the new. Others see in Bruno&#x27;s idea of multiple worlds instantiating the infinite possibilities of a pristine, indivisible One, a forerunner of Everett&#x27;s many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

While many academics note Bruno&#x27;s theological position as pantheism, several have described it as pandeism, and some also as panentheism. Physicist and philosopher Max Bernhard Weinstein in his &quot;Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis&quot; (&quot;World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature&quot;), wrote that the theological model of pandeism was strongly expressed in the teachings of Bruno, especially with respect to the vision of a deity for which &quot;the concept of God is not separated from that of the universe.&quot; However, Otto Kern takes exception to what he considers Weinstein&#x27;s overbroad assertions that Bruno, as well as other historical philosophers such as John Scotus Eriugena, Nicholas of Cusa, Mendelssohn, and Lessing, were pandeists or leaned towards pandeism. &quot;Discover&quot; editor Corey S. Powell also described Bruno&#x27;s cosmology as pandeistic, writing that it was &quot;a tool for advancing an animist or Pandeist theology&quot;, and this assessment of Bruno as a pandeist was agreed with by science writer Michael Newton Keas, and &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; writer David Sessions.

==Retrospective views==

===Late Vatican position===
The Vatican has published few official statements about Bruno&#x27;s trial and execution. In 1942, Cardinal Giovanni Mercati, who discovered a number of lost documents relating to Bruno&#x27;s trial, stated that the Church was perfectly justified in condemning him. On the 400th anniversary of Bruno&#x27;s death, in 2000, Cardinal Angelo Sodano declared Bruno&#x27;s death to be a &quot;sad episode&quot; but, despite his regret, he defended Bruno&#x27;s prosecutors, maintaining that the Inquisitors &quot;had the desire to serve freedom and promote the common good and did everything possible to save his life&quot;. In the same year, Pope John Paul II made a general apology for &quot;the use of violence that some have committed in the service of truth&quot;.

===A martyr of science===

Some authors have characterized Bruno as a &quot;martyr of science&quot;, suggesting parallels with the Galileo affair which began around 1610. &quot;It should not be supposed,&quot; writes A. M. Paterson of Bruno and his &quot;heliocentric solar system&quot;, that he &quot;reached his conclusions via some mystical revelation ... His work is an essential part of the scientific and philosophical developments that he initiated.&quot; Paterson echoes Hegel in writing that Bruno &quot;ushers in a modern theory of knowledge that understands all natural things in the universe to be known by the human mind through the mind&#x27;s dialectical structure&quot;.

Ingegno writes that Bruno embraced the philosophy of Lucretius, &quot;aimed at liberating man from the fear of death and the gods.&quot; Characters in Bruno&#x27;s &quot;Cause, Principle and Unity&quot; desire &quot;to improve speculative science and knowledge of natural things,&quot; and to achieve a philosophy &quot;which brings about the perfection of the human intellect most easily and eminently, and most closely corresponds to the truth of nature.&quot;

Other scholars oppose such views, and claim Bruno&#x27;s martyrdom to science to be exaggerated, or outright false. For Yates, while &quot;nineteenth century liberals&quot; were thrown &quot;into ecstasies&quot; over Bruno&#x27;s Copernicanism, &quot;Bruno pushes Copernicus&#x27; scientific work back into a prescientific stage, back into Hermeticism, interpreting the Copernican diagram as a hieroglyph of divine mysteries.&quot;

According to historian Mordechai Feingold, &quot;Both admirers and critics of Giordano Bruno basically agree that he was pompous and arrogant, highly valuing his opinions and showing little patience with anyone who even mildly disagreed with him.&quot; Discussing Bruno&#x27;s experience of rejection when he visited Oxford University, Feingold suggests that &quot;it might have been Bruno&#x27;s manner, his language and his self-assertiveness, rather than his ideas&quot; that caused offence.

===Theological heresy===
In his &quot;Lectures on the History of Philosophy&quot;, Hegel writes that Bruno&#x27;s life represented &quot;a bold rejection of all Catholic beliefs resting on mere authority.&quot;

Alfonso Ingegno states that Bruno&#x27;s philosophy &quot;challenges the developments of the Reformation, calls into question the truth-value of the whole of Christianity, and claims that Christ perpetrated a deceit on mankind ... Bruno suggests that we can now recognize the universal law which controls the perpetual becoming of all things in an infinite universe.&quot; A. M. Paterson says that, while we no longer have a copy of the official papal condemnation of Bruno, his heresies included &quot;the doctrine of the infinite universe and the innumerable worlds&quot; and his beliefs &quot;on the movement of the earth&quot;.

Michael White notes that the Inquisition may have pursued Bruno early in his life on the basis of his opposition to Aristotle, interest in Arianism, reading of Erasmus, and possession of banned texts. White considers that Bruno&#x27;s later heresy was &quot;multifaceted&quot; and may have rested on his conception of infinite worlds. &quot;This was perhaps the most dangerous notion of all ... If other worlds existed with intelligent beings living there, did they too have their visitations? The idea was quite unthinkable.&quot;

Frances Yates rejects what she describes as the &quot;legend that Bruno was prosecuted as a philosophical thinker, was burned for his daring views on innumerable worlds or on the movement of the earth.&quot; Yates however writes that &quot;the Church was ... perfectly within its rights if it included philosophical points in its condemnation of Bruno&#x27;s heresies&quot; because &quot;the philosophical points were quite inseparable from the heresies.&quot;

According to the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, &quot;in 1600 there was no official Catholic position on the Copernican system, and it was certainly not a heresy. When [...] Bruno [...] was burned at the stake as a heretic, it had nothing to do with his writings in support of Copernican cosmology.&quot;

The website of the Vatican Apostolic Archive, discussing a summary of legal proceedings against Bruno in Rome, states:

In the same rooms where Giordano Bruno was questioned, for the same important reasons of the relationship between science and faith, at the dawning of the new astronomy and at the decline of Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy, sixteen years later, Cardinal Bellarmino, who then contested Bruno&#x27;s heretical theses, summoned Galileo Galilei, who also faced a famous inquisitorial trial, which, luckily for him, ended with a simple abjuration.

Galileo ultimately recanted his views and agreed to house arrest and was spared from being burned at the stake, while Bruno held his positions until death. The concepts of exoplanets, the idea that the shape of the universe goes on infinitely, and the solar system holding no cosmic importance or center universe, would later became major concepts in the field of cosmology, as well as philosphy.

==Cultural legacy==

===In art===

Following the 1870 Capture of Rome by the newly created Kingdom of Italy and the end of the Church&#x27;s temporal power over the city, the erection of a monument to Bruno on the site of his execution became feasible. The monument was sharply opposed by the clerical party, but was finally erected by the Rome Municipality and inaugurated in 1889.

A statue of a stretched human figure standing on its head, designed by Alexander Polzin and depicting Bruno&#x27;s death at the stake, was placed in Potsdamer Platz station in Berlin on 2 March 2008.

Retrospective iconography of Bruno shows him with a Dominican cowl but not tonsured. Edward Gosselin has suggested that it is likely Bruno kept his tonsure at least until 1579, and it is possible that he wore it again thereafter.

An idealized animated version of Bruno appears in the first episode of the 2014 television series &quot;&quot;. In this depiction, Bruno is shown with a more modern look, without tonsure and wearing clerical robes and without his hood. &quot;Cosmos&quot; presents Bruno as an impoverished philosopher who was ultimately executed due to his refusal to recant his belief in other worlds, a portrayal that was criticized by some as simplistic or historically inaccurate. Corey S. Powell, of &quot;Discover&quot; magazine, says of Bruno, &quot;A major reason he moved around so much is that he was argumentative, sarcastic, and drawn to controversy ... He was a brilliant, complicated, difficult man.

===In poetry===
Poems that refer to Bruno include:
* &quot;The Monument of Giordano Bruno&quot; (1889) by Algernon Charles Swinburne, written when the statue of Bruno was constructed in Rome.
* &quot;Campo Dei Fiori&quot; (1943) by Czesław Miłosz, which draws parallels between indifference to the fate of Bruno and indifference to the victims of the then-ongoing Occupation of Poland.
* &quot;The Emancipators&quot; (1958) by Randall Jarrell, which addresses Bruno, along with Galileo and Newton, as an originator of the modern scientific-industrial world.
* &quot;What He Thought&quot; (1994) by Heather McHugh, a (possibly autobiographical) poem about a group of American poets who visit Italy and are lectured about Bruno and the nature of poetry by a local arts administrator. The poem was published in the collection &quot;Hinge &amp; Sign&quot;, a nominee for the National Book Award.

===In fiction===
Bruno and his theory of &quot;the coincidence of contraries&quot; (&quot;coincidentia oppositorum&quot;) play an important role in James Joyce&#x27;s 1939 novel &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. Joyce wrote in a letter to his patroness, Harriet Shaw Weaver, &quot;His philosophy is a kind of dualism – every power in nature must evolve an opposite in order to realise itself and opposition brings reunion&quot;. Amongst his numerous allusions to Bruno in his novel, including his trial and torture, Joyce plays upon Bruno&#x27;s notion of &quot;coincidentia oppositorum&quot; through applying his name to word puns such as &quot;Browne and Nolan&quot; (the name of Dublin printers) and &#x27;&quot;brownesberrow in nolandsland&quot;.

In 1973 the biographical drama &quot;Giordano Bruno&quot; was released, an Italian/French movie directed by Giuliano Montaldo, starring Gian Maria Volonté as Bruno.

Bruno is a major character in the four-novel Aegypt sequence (1987–2007) by John Crowley. Historical episodes from Bruno&#x27;s life are fictionalized in the novels, and his philosophical ideas are key to the novels’ themes.

&quot;The Last Confession&quot; (2000) by Morris West is an unfinished, posthumously published fictional autobiography of Bruno, ostensibly written shortly before Bruno&#x27;s execution.

In the 2008 novel &quot;Children of God&quot; by Mary Doria Russell, several characters travel on an interstellar spaceship named &quot;Giordano Bruno&quot;.

Bruno features as the hero of the &quot;Giordano Bruno&quot; series (2010–2023) of historical crime novels by S. J. Parris (a pseudonym of Stephanie Merritt).

===In music===

Hans Werner Henze set his large scale cantata for orchestra, choir and four soloists, &quot;Novae de infinito laudes&quot; to Italian texts by Bruno, recorded in 1972 at the Salzburg Festival reissued on CD Orfeo C609 031B.

The Italian composer Francesco Filidei wrote an opera, based on a libretto by Stefano Busellato, titled &quot;Giordano Bruno&quot;. The premiere took place on 12 September 2015 at the Casa da Música in Porto, Portugal.

The 2016 song &quot;Roman Sky&quot; by heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold focuses on the death of Bruno.

Bruno is the central character in Roger Doyle’s &quot;Heresy – an electronic opera&quot; (2017).

==Legacy==
===Giordano Bruno Foundation===
The Giordano Bruno Foundation (German: Giordano-Bruno-Stiftung) is a non-profit foundation based in Germany that pursues the &quot;Support of Evolutionary Humanism&quot;. It was founded by entrepreneur Herbert Steffen in 2004. The Giordano Bruno Foundation is critical of religious fundamentalism and nationalism.

===Giordano Bruno Memorial Award===
The SETI League makes an annual award honoring the memory of Giordano Bruno to a deserving person or persons who have made a significant contribution to the practice of SETI (the search for extraterrestrial intelligence). The award was proposed by sociologist Donald Tarter in 1995 on the 395th anniversary of Bruno&#x27;s death. The trophy presented is called a Bruno.

===Astronomical objects named after Bruno===
The 22 km impact crater Giordano Bruno on the far side of the Moon is named in his honor, as are the main belt Asteroids 5148 Giordano and 13223 Cenaceneri; the latter is named after his philosophical dialogue &quot;La Cena de le Ceneri&quot; (&quot;The Ash Wednesday Supper&quot;) (see above).

<text>Geddy Lee Weinrib (; born Gary Lee Weinrib, July 29, 1953) is a Canadian musician, best known as the lead vocalist, bassist, and keyboardist for the rock group Rush. Lee joined the band in September 1968 at the request of his childhood friend Alex Lifeson, replacing original bassist and frontman Jeff Jones. Lee&#x27;s solo effort, &quot;My Favourite Headache&quot;, was released in 2000.

Lee&#x27;s style, technique, and skill on the bass have inspired many rock musicians such as Cliff Burton of Metallica; Steve Harris of Iron Maiden; John Myung of Dream Theater; Les Claypool of Primus; Steve Di Giorgio of Sadus, Death and Testament; and Tim Commerford of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave. Along with his Rush bandmates – guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart – Lee was made an Officer of the Order of Canada on May 9, 1996. The trio was the first rock band to receive this honor. In 2013, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after 14 years of eligibility. In 2006, Lee was ranked 13th by &quot;Hit Parader&quot; on their list of the 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Vocalists of All Time.

==Early life==
He was born Gary Lee Weinrib on July 29, 1953, in Willowdale, Toronto, to Morris Weinrib (born Moshe Meir Weinrib; 1920–1965) from Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski, Poland; and Mary &quot;Manya&quot; Rubinstein (born Malka Rubinstein; 1925–2021), who was also from Poland: born in Warsaw and later raised in Wierzbnik. His parents were Jewish Holocaust survivors from Poland who had survived the ghetto in Starachowice (where they met), followed by their imprisonments at Auschwitz and later Dachau and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps during the Holocaust and World War II. They were in their teens when they were initially imprisoned at Auschwitz. &quot;It was kind of surreal pre-teen shit&quot;, says Lee, describing how his father bribed guards to bring shoes to his mother. After a period, his mother was transferred to Bergen-Belsen and his father to Dachau. When the war ended four years later, and the Allies liberated the camps, Morris set out in search of Manya and found her at a Bergen-Belsen displaced persons camp. They married there and eventually emigrated to Canada.

When Lee started school, his name was incorrectly registered. As a result, Lee grew up thinking his middle name was &quot;Lorne&quot;. As a teenager, he saw a copy of his birth certificate and discovered that his middle name was &quot;Lee&quot;.

Lee&#x27;s father died young, which forced Lee&#x27;s mother to work to support their three children by running the Newmarket, Ontario, variety store that her husband had owned and managed. Lee has suggested that his father&#x27;s death was probably a factor in his becoming a musician: &quot;It was a terrible blow that I lost him, but the course of my life changed because my mother couldn&#x27;t control us.&quot; He has said that losing his father at such an early age made him aware of how &quot;quickly life can disappear&quot;, which inspired him from then on to get the most out of his life and music.

Lee turned his basement into practice space for a band he formed with high school friends. After the band began earning income from small performances at high school shows or other events, he decided to drop out of high school and play rock and roll professionally. His mother was devastated when he gave her the news. 
&quot;Jweekly&quot; featured Lee&#x27;s reflections on his mother&#x27;s experiences as a refugee and on his own Jewish heritage. Lee&#x27;s name, &quot;Geddy&quot;, was derived from his mother&#x27;s Polish-accented pronunciation of his given first name, &quot;Gary&quot;. This was picked up by his friends in school, leading Lee to adopt it as his stage name (excising his surname, leaving his middle name as his surname) and later his legal name, Geddy Lee Weinrib (replacing his first name).

After Rush had become a widely recognized rock group, Lee told the group&#x27;s drummer and lyricist, Neil Peart, about his mother&#x27;s early life. Peart then wrote the lyrics to &quot;Red Sector A&quot;, which was inspired by her ordeal. The song, for which Lee wrote the music, was released on the band&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;. The lyrics include the following verse:
==Music career==
===Early years===
Lee began playing music in school when he was 10 or 11 and received his first acoustic guitar at 14. In school, he first played drums, trumpet and clarinet. However, learning to play instruments in school was not satisfying to Lee, and he took basic piano lessons independently. His interest increased dramatically after listening to some of the popular rock groups at the time. Early influences included Jack Bruce of Cream, John Entwistle of The Who, Jeff Beck, and Procol Harum. &quot;I was mainly interested in early British progressive rock&quot;, said Lee. &quot;That&#x27;s how I learned to play bass, emulating Jack Bruce and people like that.&quot; Bruce&#x27;s style of music was also noticed by Lee, who liked that &quot;his sound was distinctive – it wasn&#x27;t boring.&quot; Lee has also been influenced by Paul McCartney, Chris Squire, and James Jamerson.

In 1969, Rush began playing professionally in coffeehouses, high school dances and at various outdoor recreational events. By 1971, they were now playing primarily original songs in small clubs and bars, including Toronto&#x27;s Gasworks and Abbey Road Pub. Lee describes the group during these early years as being &quot;weekend warriors&quot;. They were holding down jobs during the weekdays and playing music on weekends: &quot;We longed to break out of the boring surrounding of the suburbs and the endless similarities . . . the shopping plazas and all that stuff...the music was a vehicle for us to speak out.&quot; He claims that in the beginning, they were simply &quot;a straightforward rock band.&quot;

Short of money, they began opening concerts at venues such as Toronto&#x27;s Victory Burlesque Theatre for the glam rock band New York Dolls. By 1972, Rush began performing full-length concerts, mainly consisting of original songs, in cities including Toronto and Detroit. As they gained more recognition, they began performing as an opening act for groups such as Aerosmith, Kiss, and Blue Öyster Cult.

===Style===

Like Cream, Rush followed the model of a &quot;power trio&quot;, with Lee playing bass and singing. Lee&#x27;s vocals produced a distinctive, resonant &quot;countertenor&quot;. Lee possessed a three-octave vocal range spanning from baritone through tenor, alto, and mezzo-soprano pitch ranges; however, his range significantly decreased with age. Lee&#x27;s playing style is widely regarded for his use of high treble and very hard playing of the strings and for utilizing the bass as a lead instrument, often contrapuntal to Lifeson&#x27;s guitar. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Lee mostly used a Rickenbacker 4001 bass, with a very noticeable grit in his tone. According to Lee, during the band&#x27;s &quot;synth era&quot; in the mid-1980s, Lee used Steinberger and later Wal basses, with the latter having more of a &quot;jazzy&quot; tone. From 1993&#x27;s &quot;Counterparts&quot; onward, Lee began using the Fender Jazz Bass almost exclusively, returning to his trademark high treble sound. Lee had first used the Jazz Bass to record &quot; Moving Pictures&quot; on songs such as &quot;Tom Sawyer.&quot;

===Rising popularity===
After several early albums and increasing popularity, Rush&#x27;s status as a rock group soared over the following five years as they consistently toured worldwide and produced successful albums, including &quot;2112&quot; (1976), &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; (1977), &quot;Hemispheres&quot; (1978), &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; (1980), and &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; (1981). Lee began adding synthesizers in 1977, with the release of &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot;. Keyboard critic Greg Armbruster says the additional sounds from synthesizers expanded the group&#x27;s &quot;textural capabilities&quot; and allowed the trio to produce an orchestrated and more complex progressive rock music style. It also gave Lee the ability to play bass simultaneously, as he could control the synthesizer with foot pedals. In 1981, he won &quot;Keyboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s poll as &quot;Best New Talent.&quot; By the 1984 album &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;, Lee was surrounding himself with stacks of keyboards on stage.

By the 1980s, Rush had become one of the &quot;biggest rock bands on the planet&quot;, selling out arena seats when touring. Lee was known for his dynamic stage movements. According to music critic Tom Mulhern, writing in 1980, &quot;it&#x27;s dazzling to see so much sheer energy expended without a nervous breakdown.&quot; By 1996, their Test for Echo Tour began performing without an opening act, their shows lasting nearly three hours.

Music industry writer Christopher Buttner, who interviewed Lee in 1996, described him as a prodigy and &quot;role model&quot; for what every musician wants to be, noting his proficiency on stage. Buttner cited Lee&#x27;s ability to vary time signatures, play multiple keyboards, use bass pedal controllers and control sequencers, all while singing lead vocals into as many as three microphones. Buttner adds that few musicians of any instrument &quot;can juggle half of what Geddy can do without literally falling on their ass.&quot; As a result, notes Mulhern, Lee&#x27;s instrumentation was the &quot;pulse&quot; of the group and created a &quot;one-man rhythm section&quot;, which complemented guitarist Alex Lifeson and percussionist Neil Peart. Bass instructor Allan Slutsky, or &quot;Dr Licks&quot;, credits Lee&#x27;s &quot;biting, high-end bass lines and creative synthesizer work&quot; for helping the group become &quot;one of the most innovative&quot; of all the groups that play arena rock. By 1989, &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine had designated Lee the &quot;Best Rock Bass&quot; player from their reader&#x27;s poll for the previous five years.

Greg Prato of AllMusic wrote that &quot;few hard rock bassists have been as influential as Rush&#x27;s Geddy Lee.&quot; Bass players who have cited Lee as an influence include Cliff Burton of Metallica, Steve Harris of Iron Maiden, John Myung of Dream Theater, Les Claypool of Primus, and Steve Di Giorgio of Sadus, Death and Testament.

==&quot;My Favourite Headache&quot;==
&quot;My Favourite Headache&quot;, Lee&#x27;s solo album, was released on November 14, 2000, while Rush was on a hiatus following the deaths of Neil Peart&#x27;s daughter and wife. Musicians associated with the project include friend and Rush collaborator Ben Mink and drummer Matt Cameron of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam.

==Side projects==

The bulk of Lee&#x27;s work in music has been with Rush (see Rush discography). However, Lee has also contributed to a body of work outside of his involvement with the band through guest appearances and album production. In 1980, Lee was brought in to produce Toronto-based band Wireless who had previously opened up for Rush and were on the verge of breaking up. With Lee at the helm, the group recorded their third and final album, &quot;No Static&quot;, released on Rush&#x27;s label, Anthem Records.

In 1981, Lee was the featured guest for the hit song &quot;Take Off&quot; and its included comedic commentary with Bob and Doug McKenzie (played by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas, respectively) for the McKenzie Brothers&#x27; comedy album &quot;Great White North&quot;, which was released on Rush&#x27;s Anthem label. While Rush has had great success selling albums, &quot;Take Off&quot; is the highest-charting single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 of Lee&#x27;s career.

In 1982, Lee produced the first (and only) album from Toronto&#x27;s new wave band Boys Brigade. On the 1985 album &quot;We Are the World&quot;, by humanitarian consortium USA for Africa, Lee recorded guest vocals for the song &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot;. Lee sang &quot;O Canada&quot;, the Canadian national anthem, at Baltimore&#x27;s Camden Yards for the 1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.

Another version of &quot;O Canada&quot;, with a rock arrangement, was recorded by Lee and Lifeson for the 1999 film soundtrack &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut&quot;.

Lee also plays bass on Canadian rock band I Mother Earth&#x27;s track &quot;Good for Sule&quot;, which is featured on the group&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Blue Green Orange&quot;.

Along with his bandmates, Lee was a guest musician on the Max Webster song &quot;Battle Scar&quot;, from the 1980 album &quot;Universal Juveniles&quot;.

Lee appeared in Broken Social Scene&#x27;s music video for their 2006 single &quot;Fire Eye&#x27;d Boy&quot;, judging the band while performing various musical tasks. In 2006, Lee joined Lifeson&#x27;s supergroup, the Big Dirty Band, to provide songs accompanying &quot;Trailer Park Boys: The Movie&quot;.

In 2017, Lee performed in place of late bassist Chris Squire with Yes during the band&#x27;s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, playing bass for the song &quot;Roundabout.&quot;

In 2018, Lee published &quot;Geddy Lee&#x27;s Big Beautiful Book of Bass&quot;, which highlights his collection of over 250 basses along with interviews with some of the leading bass players and bass technicians.

In 2020, Lee provided guest vocals to an all-star Canadian rendition of the late Bill Withers song &quot;Lean on Me&quot; during the TV special &quot;Stronger Together, Tous Ensemble&quot;, a Canadian benefit performance simulcast by every major television network in Canada as a benefit for Food Banks Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked him as the 24th-greatest bassist of all time.

In September 2021, Barenaked Ladies frontman Ed Robertson revealed that he was working on a &quot;secret project&quot; with Lee, which turned out to be callouts for a subsequent Rush pinball machine.

In 2022, he appeared as a guest star playing Thomas Sawyer on the acclaimed long-running CBC period drama Murdoch Mysteries.

In November 2023, Lee published an autobiography titled &quot;My Effin&#x27; Life&quot;. The book was promoted with a 19-date tour of the UK and North America.

On December 5, 2023, Paramount+ released a video series, &quot;Geddy Lee Asks: Are Bass Players Human Too?&quot; Four episodes were aired on Les Claypool, Robert Trujillo, Melissa Auf der Maur, and Krist Novoselic. Each episode features Lee visiting with and talking to the guest bassist.

==Collections==
Lee is a collector, and has collected baseball ephemera, vintage bass guitars, and wines, with a collection of 5,000 bottles. As a child he collected stamps and vinyl records. He went on to collect first edition books as well as bass guitars. Lee is also an avid watch collector.

===Baseball===

Lee is also a longtime baseball fan. His favourite team while growing up was the Detroit Tigers, and he later became a fan of the Toronto Blue Jays after they were established. In the 1980s, Lee began reading the works of Bill James, particularly &quot;The Bill James Baseball Abstracts&quot;, which led to an interest in sabermetrics and participation in a fantasy baseball keeper league. He collects baseball memorabilia, once donating part of his collection to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, and threw the ceremonial first pitch to inaugurate the 2013 Toronto Blue Jays season. Lee sang the Canadian national anthem before the 1993 MLB All-Star Game. In 2016, Lee planned to produce an independent film about baseball in Italy. Lee is regularly seen in his seat behind home plate at the Toronto Blue Jays stadium Rogers Centre with his scorecard. When the team was forced to move to Buffalo during the 2020 season, a cardboard cutout of Lee was placed in a seat behind home plate.

===Guitars and basses===
Lee also collects guitars and basses. He has a collection of over 250 vintage basses. He owns a 1961 Fender Precision Bass previously owned by John Entwistle of The Who. He also owns two 1964 Fender Jazz Basses in the rare Dakota Red color.

In 2019, Lee sent several of his guitars to Mecum Auctions, including a 1959 Les Paul Standard, a 1960 Gibson ES-345, a 1955 Fender Stratocaster, a 1960 Gibson ES-335, a 1965 Gibson ES-335 and a 1967 Gibson Flying V.

==Equipment used==

===Basses===

In the early days of Rush, Lee used a Fender Precision Bass, which eventually had its body modified and refinished to a blue &quot;teardrop&quot;-shape. Inspired by the distinctive sound of Yes bassist Chris Squire, Lee then acquired a black Rickenbacker 4001 bass, which remained his main instrument from the 1970s up until the early 1980s.

In 1998, Fender released the Geddy Lee Jazz Bass, available in Black and 3-Color Sunburst (as of 2009). This signature model is a recreation of Lee&#x27;s favourite bass, a 1972 Fender Jazz that he bought in a pawn shop in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 1978. In 2015, Fender released a revised USA model of his signature bass, with most of the changes reflecting those Lee had made to his own instrument over the years.

Lee has been a longtime user of RotoSound strings. He uses Swing Bass RS66LD (.45-.105) on a majority of his basses, but used Funkmaster FM66 (.30-.90) on his Wal basses from 1985 to 1992.

===Bass amplification===
For Rush&#x27;s 2010 tour, Lee used two Orange AD200 bass heads together with two OBC410 4x10 bass cabinets.

===Keyboards and synthesizers===
Over the years, Lee has used synthesizers from Oberheim (Oberheim Eight Voice, OB-1, OB-X, OB-Xa), PPG (Wave 2.2 and 2.3), Roland (Jupiter 8, D-50, XV-5080, and Fantom X7), Moog (Minimoog, Taurus pedals, Little Phatty), and Yamaha (DX7, KX76).

===Live performances: special equipment===
====Recreating unique sounds====
Newer advances in synthesizer and sampler technology have allowed Lee to store familiar sounds from his old synthesizers alongside new ones in combination synthesizer/samplers, such as the Roland XV-5080. For live shows in 2002 and 2004, Lee and his keyboard technician used the playback capabilities of the XV-5080 to generate virtually all of Rush&#x27;s keyboard sounds to date and additional complex sound passages that previously required several machines at once to produce.

To trigger these sounds in real-time, Lee uses MIDI controllers, placed at the locations on the stage where he has a microphone stand. Lee uses two types of MIDI controllers: one type resembles a traditional synthesizer keyboard on a stand (Yamaha KX76). The second type is a large foot-pedal keyboard placed on the stage floor (Korg MPK-130, Roland PK-5). Combined, they enable Lee to use his free hands and feet to trigger sounds in electronic equipment that has been placed off-stage. With this technology Lee and his bandmates can present their arrangements in a live setting with the level of complexity and fidelity that fans have come to expect and without the need to resort to the use of backing tracks or employing an additional band member. During the &quot;Clockwork Angels Tour&quot;, a notable exception was when a string ensemble played string parts, originally arranged and conducted by David Campbell on &quot;Clockwork Angels&quot;.

====Unique stage equipment====
In 1996, Lee stopped using traditional bass amplifiers on stage, opting to have the bass guitar signals input directly to the touring front-of-house console to improve control and sound definition. He began using Tech 21 SansAmp units after experimenting with one in the studio intended for Alex Lifeson&#x27;s guitar and eventually received signature models from the company, most notably the GED-2112 rackmount.

Faced with the dilemma of what to do with the empty space left behind by the lack of large amplifier cabinets, Lee chose to decorate his side of the stage with unusual items. The Snakes &amp; Arrows Tour prominently featured three Henhouse brand rotisserie chicken ovens on stage complete with an attendant in a chef&#x27;s hat and apron to &quot;tend&quot; the chickens during shows.

Lee married Nancy Young in 1976. They have a son and a daughter. He takes annual trips to France, where he indulges in cheese and wine. In 2011, a charitable foundation he supports, Grapes for Humanity, created the Geddy Lee Scholarship for winemaking students at Niagara College. Lee has described himself as a Jewish atheist, explaining to an interviewer, &quot;I consider myself a Jew as a race, but not so much as a religion. I&#x27;m not down with religion at all. I&#x27;m a Jewish atheist, if that&#x27;s possible.&quot;

<text>The geologic time scale or geological time scale (GTS) is a representation of time based on the rock record of Earth. It is a system of chronological dating that uses chronostratigraphy (the process of relating strata to time) and geochronology (a scientific branch of geology that aims to determine the age of rocks). It is used primarily by Earth scientists (including geologists, paleontologists, geophysicists, geochemists, and paleoclimatologists) to describe the timing and relationships of events in geologic history. The time scale has been developed through the study of rock layers and the observation of their relationships and identifying features such as lithologies, paleomagnetic properties, and fossils. The definition of standardised international units of geological time is the responsibility of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), a constituent body of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), whose primary objective is to precisely define global chronostratigraphic units of the International Chronostratigraphic Chart (ICC) that are used to define divisions of geological time. The chronostratigraphic divisions are in turn used to define geochronologic units.

== Principles ==

The geologic time scale is a way of representing deep time based on events that have occurred throughout Earth&#x27;s history, a time span of about 4.54 ± 0.05 Ga (4.54 billion years). It chronologically organises strata, and subsequently time, by observing fundamental changes in stratigraphy that correspond to major geological or paleontological events. For example, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, marks the lower boundary of the Paleogene System/Period and thus the boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene systems/periods. For divisions prior to the Cryogenian, arbitrary numeric boundary definitions (Global Standard Stratigraphic Ages, GSSAs) are used to divide geologic time. Proposals have been made to better reconcile these divisions with the rock record.

Historically, regional geologic time scales were used due to the litho- and biostratigraphic differences around the world in time equivalent rocks. The ICS has long worked to reconcile conflicting terminology by standardising globally significant and identifiable stratigraphic horizons that can be used to define the lower boundaries of chronostratigraphic units. Defining chronostratigraphic units in such a manner allows for the use of global, standardised nomenclature. The International Chronostratigraphic Chart represents this ongoing effort.

Several key principles are used to determine the relative relationships of rocks and thus their chronostratigraphic position.

The law of superposition that states that in undeformed stratigraphic sequences the oldest strata will lie at the bottom of the sequence, while newer material stacks upon the surface. In practice, this means a younger rock will lie on top of an older rock unless there is evidence to suggest otherwise.

The principle of original horizontality that states layers of sediments will originally be deposited horizontally under the action of gravity. However, it is now known that not all sedimentary layers are deposited purely horizontally, but this principle is still a useful concept.

The principle of lateral continuity that states layers of sediments extend laterally in all directions until either thinning out or being cut off by a different rock layer, i.e. they are laterally continuous. Layers do not extend indefinitely; their limits are controlled by the amount and type of sediment in a sedimentary basin, and the geometry of that basin.

The principle of cross-cutting relationships that states a rock that cuts across another rock must be younger than the rock it cuts across.

The law of included fragments that states small fragments of one type of rock that are embedded in a second type of rock must have formed first, and were included when the second rock was forming.

The relationships of unconformities which are geologic features representing a gap in the geologic record. Unconformities are formed during periods of erosion or non-deposition, indicating non-continuous sediment deposition. Observing the type and relationships of unconformities in strata allows geologist to understand the relative timing the strata.

The principle of faunal succession (where applicable) that states rock strata contain distinctive sets of fossils that succeed each other vertically in a specific and reliable order. This allows for a correlation of strata even when the horizon between them is not continuous.

== Divisions of geologic time ==

The geologic time scale is divided into chronostratigraphic units and their corresponding geochronologic units.

* An is the largest geochronologic time unit and is equivalent to a chronostratigraphic eonothem. There are four formally defined eons: the Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic and Phanerozoic.
* An is the second largest geochronologic time unit and is equivalent to a chronostratigraphic erathem. There are ten defined eras: the Eoarchean, Paleoarchean, Mesoarchean, Neoarchean, Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic, Neoproterozoic, Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic, with none from the Hadean eon.
* A is equivalent to a chronostratigraphic system. There are 22 defined periods, with the current being the Quaternary period. As an exception, two subperiods are used for the Carboniferous Period.
* An is the second smallest geochronologic unit. It is equivalent to a chronostratigraphic series. There are 37 defined epochs and one informal one. The current epoch is the Holocene. There are also 11 subepochs which are all within the Neogene and Quaternary. The use of subepochs as formal units in international chronostratigraphy was ratified in 2022.
* An is the smallest hierarchical geochronologic unit. It is equivalent to a chronostratigraphic stage. There are 96 formal and five informal ages. The current age is the Meghalayan.
* A &quot;&quot; is a non-hierarchical formal geochronology unit of unspecified rank and is equivalent to a chronostratigraphic chronozone. These correlate with magnetostratigraphic, lithostratigraphic, or biostratigraphic units as they are based on previously defined stratigraphic units or geologic features.

The subdivisions and are used as the geochronologic equivalents of the chronostratigraphic and , e.g., Early Triassic Period (geochronologic unit) is used in place of Lower Triassic System (chronostratigraphic unit).

Rocks representing a given chronostratigraphic unit are that chronostratigraphic unit, and the time they were laid down in is the geochronologic unit, e.g., the rocks that represent the Silurian System the Silurian System and they were deposited the Silurian Period. This definition means the numeric age of a geochronologic unit can be changed (and is more often subject to change) when refined by geochronometry while the equivalent chronostratigraphic unit (the revision of which is less frequent) remains unchanged. For example, in early 2022, the boundary between the Ediacaran and Cambrian periods (geochronologic units) was revised from 541 Ma to 538.8 Ma but the rock definition of the boundary (GSSP) at the base of the Cambrian, and thus the boundary between the Ediacaran and Cambrian systems (chronostratigraphic units) has not been changed; rather, the absolute age has merely been refined.

=== Terminology ===

 is the element of stratigraphy that deals with the relation between rock bodies and the relative measurement of geological time. It is the process where distinct strata between defined stratigraphic horizons are assigned to represent a relative interval of geologic time.

A is a body of rock, layered or unlayered, that is defined between specified stratigraphic horizons which represent specified intervals of geologic time. They include all rocks representative of a specific interval of geologic time, and only this time span. Eonothem, erathem, system, series, subseries, stage, and substage are the hierarchical chronostratigraphic units.

A is a subdivision of geologic time. It is a numeric representation of an intangible property (time). These units are arranged in a hierarchy: eon, era, period, epoch, subepoch, age, and subage. 
 is the scientific branch of geology that aims to determine the age of rocks, fossils, and sediments either through absolute (e.g., radiometric dating) or relative means (e.g., stratigraphic position, paleomagnetism, stable isotope ratios). 
 is the field of geochronology that numerically quantifies geologic time. 

A (GSSP) is an internationally agreed-upon reference point on a stratigraphic section that defines the lower boundaries of stages on the geologic time scale. (Recently this has been used to define the base of a system)

A (GSSA) is a numeric-only, chronologic reference point used to define the base of geochronologic units prior to the Cryogenian. These points are arbitrarily defined. They are used where GSSPs have not yet been established. Research is ongoing to define GSSPs for the base of all units that are currently defined by GSSAs.

The standard international units of the geologic time scale are published by the International Commission on Stratigraphy on the International Chronostratigraphic Chart; however, regional terms are still in use in some areas. The numeric values on the International Chronostratigrahpic Chart are represented by the unit Ma (megaannum, for &#x27;million years&#x27;). For example, Ma, the lower boundary of the Jurassic Period, is defined as 201,400,000 years old with an uncertainty of 200,000 years. Other SI prefix units commonly used by geologists are Ga (gigaannum, billion years), and ka (kiloannum, thousand years), with the latter often represented in calibrated units (before present).

== Naming of geologic time ==
The names of geologic time units are defined for chronostratigraphic units with the corresponding geochronologic unit sharing the same name with a change to the suffix (e.g. Phanerozoic Eonothem becomes the Phanerozoic Eon). Names of erathems in the Phanerozoic were chosen to reflect major changes in the history of life on Earth: Paleozoic (old life), Mesozoic (middle life), and Cenozoic (new life). Names of systems are diverse in origin, with some indicating chronologic position (e.g., Paleogene), while others are named for lithology (e.g., Cretaceous), geography (e.g., Permian), or are tribal (e.g., Ordovician) in origin. Most currently recognised series and subseries are named for their position within a system/series (early/middle/late); however, the International Commission on Stratigraphy advocates for all new series and subseries to be named for a geographic feature in the vicinity of its stratotype or type locality. The name of stages should also be derived from a geographic feature in the locality of its stratotype or type locality.

Informally, the time before the Cambrian is often referred to as the Precambrian or pre-Cambrian (Supereon).


== History of the geologic time scale ==
=== Early history ===
The most modern geological time scale was not formulated until 1911 by Arthur Holmes (1890 – 1965), who drew inspiration from James Hutton (1726–1797), a Scottish Geologist who presented the idea of uniformitarianism or the theory that changes to the Earth&#x27;s crust resulted from continuous and uniform processes. The broader concept of the relation between rocks and time can be traced back to (at least) the philosophers of Ancient Greece from 1200 BC to 600 AD. Xenophanes of Colophon (c. 570–487 BCE) observed rock beds with fossils of seashells located above the sea-level, viewed them as once living organisms, and used this to imply an unstable relationship in which the sea had at times transgressed over the land and at other times had regressed. This view was shared by a few of Xenophanes&#x27;s scholars and those that followed, including Aristotle (384–322 BC) who (with additional observations) reasoned that the positions of land and sea had changed over long periods of time. The concept of deep time was also recognized by Chinese naturalist Shen Kuo (1031–1095) and Islamic scientist-philosophers, notably the Brothers of Purity, who wrote on the processes of stratification over the passage of time in their treatises. Their work likely inspired that of the 11th-century Persian polymath Avicenna (Ibn Sînâ, 980–1037) who wrote in &quot;The Book of Healing&quot; (1027) on the concept of stratification and superposition, pre-dating Nicolas Steno by more than six centuries. Avicenna also recognized fossils as &quot;petrifications of the bodies of plants and animals&quot;, with the 13th-century Dominican bishop Albertus Magnus (c. 1200–1280), who drew from Aristotle&#x27;s natural philosophy, extending this into a theory of a petrifying fluid. These works appeared to have little influence on scholars in Medieval Europe who looked to the Bible to explain the origins of fossils and sea-level changes, often attributing these to the &#x27;Deluge&#x27;, including Ristoro d&#x27;Arezzo in 1282. It was not until the Italian Renaissance when Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) would reinvigorate the relationships between stratification, relative sea-level change, and time, denouncing attribution of fossils to the &#x27;Deluge&#x27;:

These views of da Vinci remained unpublished, and thus lacked influence at the time; however, questions of fossils and their significance were pursued and, while views against Genesis were not readily accepted and dissent from religious doctrine was in some places unwise, scholars such as Girolamo Fracastoro shared da Vinci&#x27;s views, and found the attribution of fossils to the &#x27;Deluge&#x27; absurd. Although many theories surrounding philosophy and concepts of rocks were developed in earlier years, &quot;the first serious attempts to formulate a geological time scale that could be applied anywhere on Earth were made in the late 18th century.&quot; Later, in the 19th century, academics further developed theories on stratification. William Smith, often referred to as the &quot;Father of Geology&quot; developed theories through observations rather than drawing from the scholars that came before him. Smith&#x27;s work was primarily based on his detailed study of rock layers and fossils during his time and he created &quot;the first map to depict so many rock formations over such a large area”. After studying rock layers and the fossils they contained, Smith concluded that each layer of rock contained distinct material that could be used to identify and correlate rock layers across different regions of the world. Smith developed the concept of faunal succession or the idea that fossils can serve as a marker for the age of the strata they are found in and published his ideas in his 1816 book, &quot;Strata identified by organized fossils.&quot;

=== Establishment of primary principles ===
Niels Stensen, more commonly known as Nicolas Steno (1638–1686), is credited with establishing four of the guiding principles of stratigraphy. In &quot;De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus&quot; Steno states:

* When any given stratum was being formed, all the matter resting on it was fluid and, therefore, when the lowest stratum was being formed, none of the upper strata existed.
* ... strata which are either perpendicular to the horizon or inclined to it were at one time parallel to the horizon.
* When any given stratum was being formed, it was either encompassed at its edges by another solid substance or it covered the whole globe of the earth. Hence, it follows that wherever bared edges of strata are seen, either a continuation of the same strata must be looked for or another solid substance must be found that kept the material of the strata from being dispersed.
* If a body or discontinuity cuts across a stratum, it must have formed after that stratum.

Respectively, these are the principles of superposition, original horizontality, lateral continuity, and cross-cutting relationships. From this Steno reasoned that strata were laid down in succession and inferred relative time (in Steno&#x27;s belief, time from Creation). While Steno&#x27;s principles were simple and attracted much attention, applying them proved challenging. These basic principles, albeit with improved and more nuanced interpretations, still form the foundational principles of determining the correlation of strata relative to geologic time.

Over the course of the 18th-century geologists realised that:
* Sequences of strata often become eroded, distorted, tilted, or even inverted after deposition
* Strata laid down at the same time in different areas could have entirely different appearances
* The strata of any given area represented only part of Earth&#x27;s long history

=== Formulation of a modern geologic time scale ===
The apparent, earliest formal division of the geologic record with respect to time was introduced during the era of Biblical models by Thomas Burnet who applied a two-fold terminology to mountains by identifying &quot;&quot;montes primarii&quot; for rock formed at the time of the &#x27;Deluge&#x27;, and younger &quot;monticulos secundarios&quot; formed later from the debris of the &quot;primarii&quot;&quot;. Anton Moro (1687–1784) also used primary and secondary divisions for rock units but his mechanism was volcanic. In this early version of the Plutonism theory, the interior of Earth was seen as hot, and this drove the creation of primary igneous and metamorphic rocks and secondary rocks formed contorted and fossiliferous sediments. These primary and secondary divisions were expanded on by Giovanni Targioni Tozzetti (1712–1783) and Giovanni Arduino (1713–1795) to include tertiary and quaternary divisions. These divisions were used to describe both the time during which the rocks were laid down, and the collection of rocks themselves (i.e., it was correct to say Tertiary rocks, and Tertiary Period). Only the Quaternary division is retained in the modern geologic time scale, while the Tertiary division was in use until the early 21st century. The Neptunism and Plutonism theories would compete into the early 19th century with a key driver for resolution of this debate being the work of James Hutton (1726–1797), in particular his &quot;Theory of the Earth&quot;, first presented before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1785. Hutton&#x27;s theory would later become known as uniformitarianism, popularised by John Playfair (1748–1819) and later Charles Lyell (1797–1875) in his &quot;Principles of Geology&quot;. Their theories strongly contested the 6,000 year age of the Earth as suggested determined by James Ussher via Biblical chronology that was accepted at the time by western religion. Instead, using geological evidence, they contested Earth to be much older, cementing the concept of deep time.

During the early 19th century William Smith, Georges Cuvier, Jean d&#x27;Omalius d&#x27;Halloy, and Alexandre Brongniart pioneered the systematic division of rocks by stratigraphy and fossil assemblages. These geologists began to use the local names given to rock units in a wider sense, correlating strata across national and continental boundaries based on their similarity to each other. Many of the names below erathem/era rank in use on the modern ICC/GTS were determined during the early to mid-19th century.

=== The advent of geochronometry ===
During the 19th century, the debate regarding Earth&#x27;s age was renewed, with geologists estimating ages based on denudation rates and sedimentary thicknesses or ocean chemistry, and physicists determining ages for the cooling of the Earth or the Sun using basic thermodynamics or orbital physics. These estimations varied from 15,000 million years to 0.075 million years depending on method and author, but the estimations of Lord Kelvin and Clarence King were held in high regard at the time due to their pre-eminence in physics and geology. All of these early geochronometric determinations would later prove to be incorrect.

The discovery of radioactive decay by Henri Becquerel, Marie Curie, and Pierre Curie laid the ground work for radiometric dating, but the knowledge and tools required for accurate determination of radiometric ages would not be in place until the mid-1950s. Early attempts at determining ages of uranium minerals and rocks by Ernest Rutherford, Bertram Boltwood, Robert Strutt, and Arthur Holmes, would culminate in what are considered the first international geological time scales by Holmes in 1911 and 1913. The discovery of isotopes in 1913 by Frederick Soddy, and the developments in mass spectrometry pioneered by Francis William Aston, Arthur Jeffrey Dempster, and Alfred O. C. Nier during the early to mid-20th century would finally allow for the accurate determination of radiometric ages, with Holmes publishing several revisions to his &quot;geological time-scale&quot; with his final version in 1960.

=== Modern international geological time scale ===
The establishment of the IUGS in 1961 and acceptance of the Commission on Stratigraphy (applied in 1965) to become a member commission of IUGS led to the founding of the ICS. One of the primary objectives of the ICS is &quot;the establishment, publication and revision of the ICS International Chronostratigraphic Chart which is the standard, reference global Geological Time Scale to include the ratified Commission decisions&quot;.

Following on from Holmes, several &quot;A Geological Time Scale&quot; books were published in 1982, 1989, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020. However, since 2013, the ICS has taken responsibility for producing and distributing the ICC citing the commercial nature, independent creation, and lack of oversight by the ICS on the prior published GTS versions (GTS books prior to 2013) although these versions were published in close association with the ICS. Subsequent &quot;Geologic Time Scale&quot; books (2016 and 2020) are commercial publications with no oversight from the ICS, and do not entirely conform to the chart produced by the ICS. The ICS produced GTS charts are versioned (year/month) beginning at v2013/01. At least one new version is published each year incorporating any changes ratified by the ICS since the prior version.

== Major proposed revisions to the ICC ==
=== Proposed Anthropocene Series/Epoch ===

First suggested in 2000, the &quot;Anthropocene&quot; is a proposed epoch/series for the most recent time in Earth&#x27;s history. While still informal, it is a widely used term to denote the present geologic time interval, in which many conditions and processes on Earth are profoundly altered by human impact. the Anthropocene has not been ratified by the ICS; however, in May 2019 the Anthropocene Working Group voted in favour of submitting a formal proposal to the ICS for the establishment of the Anthropocene Series/Epoch. Nevertheless, the definition of the Anthropocene as a geologic time period rather than a geologic event remains controversial and difficult.

An international working group of the ICS on pre-Cryogenian chronostratigraphic subdivision have outlined a template to improve the pre-Cryogenian geologic time scale based on the rock record to bring it in line with the post-Tonian geologic time scale. This work assessed the geologic history of the currently defined eons and eras of the pre-Cambrian, and the proposals in the &quot;Geological Time Scale&quot; books &quot;2004,&quot; &quot;2012,&quot; and &quot;2020.&quot; Their recommend revisions of the pre-Cryogenian geologic time scale were (changes from the current scale [v2023/09] are italicised):
* Three divisions of the Archean instead of four by dropping Eoarchean, and revisions to their geochronometric definition, along with the repositioning of the Siderian into the latest Neoarchean, and a potential Kratian division in the Neoarchean.
** Archean (4000–&quot;2450&quot; Ma)
*** Paleoarchean (4000–&quot;3500&quot; Ma)
*** Mesoarchean (&quot;3500–3000&quot; Ma)
*** Neoarchean (&quot;3000–2450&quot; Ma)
**** &quot;Kratian&quot; (no fixed time given, prior to the Siderian) – from Greek κράτος (&quot;krátos&quot;) &#x27;strength&#x27;.
**** Siderian (?–&quot;2450&quot; Ma) – moved from Proterozoic to end of Archean, no start time given, base of Paleoproterozoic defines the end of the Siderian
* Refinement of geochronometric divisions of the Proterozoic, Paleoproterozoic, repositioning of the Statherian into the Mesoproterozoic, new Skourian period/system in the Paleoproterozoic, new Kleisian or Syndian period/system in the Neoproterozoic.
** Paleoproterozoic (&quot;2450–1800&quot; Ma)
*** &quot;Skourian&quot; (&quot;2450&quot;–2300 Ma) – from Greek σκουριά (&quot;skouriá&quot;) &#x27;rust&#x27;.
*** Rhyacian (2300–2050 Ma)
*** Orosirian (2050–1800 Ma)
** Mesoproterozoic (&quot;1800&quot;–1000 Ma)
*** &quot;Statherian&quot; (1800–1600 Ma)
*** Calymmian (1600–1400 Ma)
*** Ectasian (1400–1200 Ma)
*** Stenian (1200–1000 Ma)
** Neoproterozoic (1000–538.8 Ma)
*** &quot;Kleisian&quot; or &quot;Syndian&quot; (&quot;1000–800&quot; Ma) – respectively from Greek κλείσιμο (&quot;kleísimo&quot;) &#x27;closure&#x27; and σύνδεση (&quot;sýndesi&quot;) &#x27;connection&#x27;.
*** Tonian (&quot;800&quot;–720 Ma)
*** Cryogenian (720–635 Ma)
*** Ediacaran (635–538.8 Ma)

==== Van Kranendonk et al. 2012 (GTS2012) ====
The book, &quot;Geologic Time Scale 2012,&quot; was the last commercial publication of an international chronostratigraphic chart that was closely associated with the ICS. It included a proposal to substantially revise the pre-Cryogenian time scale to reflect important events such as the formation of the Solar System and the Great Oxidation Event, among others, while at the same time maintaining most of the previous chronostratigraphic nomenclature for the pertinent time span. these proposed changes have not been accepted by the ICS. The proposed changes (changes from the current scale [v2023/09]) are italicised:

* Hadean Eon (4567&quot;–4030&quot; Ma)
** &quot;Chaotian&quot; Era/Erathem (&quot;4567–4404&quot; Ma) – the name alluding both to the mythological Chaos and the chaotic phase of planet formation.
** &quot;Jack Hillsian&quot; or &quot;Zirconian&quot; Era/Erathem (&quot;4404–4030&quot; Ma) – both names allude to the Jack Hills Greenstone Belt which provided the oldest mineral grains on Earth, zircons.
* Archean Eon/Eonothem (&quot;4030–2420&quot; Ma)
** Paleoarchean Era/Erathem (&quot;4030–3490&quot; Ma)
*** &quot;Acastan&quot; Period/System (&quot;4030–3810&quot; Ma) – named after the Acasta Gneiss, one of the oldest preserved pieces of continental crust.
*** &quot;Isuan&quot; Period/System (&quot;3810–3490&quot; Ma) – named after the Isua Greenstone Belt.
** Mesoarchean Era/Erathem (&quot;3490–2780&quot; Ma)
*** &quot;Vaalbaran&quot; Period/System (&quot;3490–3020&quot; Ma) – based on the names of the Kaapvaal (Southern Africa) and Pilbara (Western Australia) cratons, to reflect the growth of stable continental nuclei or proto-cratonic kernels.
*** &quot;Pongolan&quot; Period/System (&quot;3020–2780&quot; Ma) – named after the Pongola Supergroup, in reference to the well preserved evidence of terrestrial microbial communities in those rocks.
** Neoarchean Era/Erathem (&quot;2780–2420&quot; Ma)
*** &quot;Methanian&quot; Period/System (&quot;2780–2630&quot; Ma) – named for the inferred predominance of methanotrophic prokaryotes
*** Siderian Period/System (&quot;2630–2420&quot; Ma) – named for the voluminous banded iron formations formed within its duration.
* Proterozoic Eon/Eonothem (&quot;2420&quot;–538.8 Ma)
** Paleoproterozoic Era/Erathem (&quot;2420–1780&quot; Ma)
*** &quot;Oxygenian&quot; Period/System (&quot;2420–2250&quot; Ma) – named for displaying the first evidence for a global oxidising atmosphere.
*** &quot;Jatulian&quot; or &quot;Eukaryian&quot; Period/System (&quot;2250–2060&quot; Ma) – names are respectively for the Lomagundi–Jatuli δ13C isotopic excursion event spanning its duration, and for the (proposed) first fossil appearance of eukaryotes.
*** &quot;Columbian Period/System&quot; (&quot;2060–1780&quot; Ma) – named after the supercontinent Columbia.
** Mesoproterozoic Era/Erathem (&quot;1780–850&quot; Ma)
*** &quot;Rodinian&quot; Period/System (&quot;1780–850&quot; Ma) – named after the supercontinent Rodinia, stable environment.

==Table of geologic time==

The following table summarises the major events and characteristics of the divisions making up the geologic time scale of Earth. This table is arranged with the most recent geologic periods at the top, and the oldest at the bottom. The height of each table entry does not correspond to the duration of each subdivision of time. As such, this table is not to scale and does not accurately represent the relative time-spans of each geochronologic unit. While the Phanerozoic Eon looks longer than the rest, it merely spans ~539 million years (~12% of Earth&#x27;s history), whilst the previous three eons collectively span ~3,461 million years (~76% of Earth&#x27;s history). This bias toward the most recent eon is in part due to the relative lack of information about events that occurred during the first three eons compared to the current eon (the Phanerozoic). The use of subseries/subepochs has been ratified by the ICS.

While some regional terms are still in use, the table of geologic time conforms to the nomenclature, ages, and colour codes set forth by the International Commission on Stratigraphy in the official International Chronostratigraphic Chart. The International Commission on Stratigraphy also provide an online interactive version of this chart. The interactive version is based on a service delivering a machine-readable Resource Description Framework/Web Ontology Language representation of the time scale, which is available through the Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information GeoSciML project as a service and at a SPARQL end-point.


== Non-Earth based geologic time scales ==
Some other planets and satellites in the Solar System have sufficiently rigid structures to have preserved records of their own histories, for example, Venus, Mars and the Earth&#x27;s Moon. Dominantly fluid planets, such as the giant planets, do not comparably preserve their history. Apart from the Late Heavy Bombardment, events on other planets probably had little direct influence on the Earth, and events on Earth had correspondingly little effect on those planets. Construction of a time scale that links the planets is, therefore, of only limited relevance to the Earth&#x27;s time scale, except in a Solar System context. The existence, timing, and terrestrial effects of the Late Heavy Bombardment are still a matter of debate.

=== Lunar (selenological) time scale ===
The geologic history of Earth&#x27;s Moon has been divided into a time scale based on geomorphological markers, namely impact cratering, volcanism, and erosion. This process of dividing the Moon&#x27;s history in this manner means that the time scale boundaries do not imply fundamental changes in geological processes, unlike Earth&#x27;s geologic time scale. Five geologic systems/periods (Pre-Nectarian, Nectarian, Imbrian, Eratosthenian, Copernican), with the Imbrian divided into two series/epochs (Early and Late) were defined in the latest Lunar geologic time scale. The Moon is unique in the Solar System in that it is the only other body from which humans have rock samples with a known geological context.
=== Martian geologic time scale ===
The geological history of Mars has been divided into two alternate time scales. The first time scale for Mars was developed by studying the impact crater densities on the Martian surface. Through this method four periods have been defined, the Pre-Noachian (~4,500–4,100 Ma), Noachian (~4,100–3,700 Ma), Hesperian (~3,700–3,000 Ma), and Amazonian (~3,000 Ma to present).

A second time scale based on mineral alteration observed by the OMEGA spectrometer on board the Mars Express. Using this method, three periods were defined, the Phyllocian (~4,500–4,000 Ma), Theiikian (~4,000–3,500 Ma), and Siderikian (~3,500 Ma to present).

<text>The gambler&#x27;s fallacy, also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the maturity of chances, is the belief that, if an event (whose occurrences are independent and identically distributed) has occurred less frequently than expected, it is more likely to happen again in the future (or vice versa). The fallacy is commonly associated with gambling, where it may be believed, for example, that the next dice roll is more likely to be six than is usually the case because there have recently been fewer than the expected number of sixes.

The term &quot;Monte Carlo fallacy&quot; originates from an example of the phenomenon, in which the roulette wheel spun black 26 times in succession at the Monte Carlo Casino in 1913.

==Examples==
===Coin toss===

The gambler&#x27;s fallacy can be illustrated by considering the repeated toss of a fair coin. The outcomes in different tosses are statistically independent and the probability of getting heads on a single toss is (one in two). The probability of getting two heads in two tosses is (one in four) and the probability of getting three heads in three tosses is (one in eight). In general, if &quot;Ai&quot; is the event where toss &quot;i&quot; of a fair coin comes up heads, then:
:formula_1.

If after tossing four heads in a row, the next coin toss also came up heads, it would complete a run of five successive heads. Since the probability of a run of five successive heads is (one in thirty-two), a person might believe that the next flip would be more likely to come up tails rather than heads again. This is incorrect and is an example of the gambler&#x27;s fallacy. The event &quot;5 heads in a row&quot; and the event &quot;first 4 heads, then a tails&quot; are equally likely, each having probability . Since the first four tosses turn up heads, the probability that the next toss is a head is:
:formula_2.

While a run of five heads has a probability of = 0.03125 (a little over 3%), the misunderstanding lies in not realizing that this is the case &quot;only before the first coin is tossed&quot;. After the first four tosses in this example, the results are no longer unknown, so their probabilities are at that point equal to 1 (100%). The probability of a run of coin tosses of any length continuing for one more toss is always 0.5. The reasoning that a fifth toss is more likely to be tails because the previous four tosses were heads, with a run of luck in the past influencing the odds in the future, forms the basis of the fallacy.

===Why the probability is for a fair coin===
If a fair coin is flipped 21 times, the probability of 21 heads is 1 in 2,097,152. The probability of flipping a head after having already flipped 20 heads in a row is . Assuming a fair coin:
* The probability of 20 heads, then 1 tail is 0.520 × 0.5 = 0.521
* The probability of 20 heads, then 1 head is 0.520 × 0.5 = 0.521

The probability of getting 20 heads then 1 tail, and the probability of getting 20 heads then another head are both 1 in 2,097,152. When flipping a fair coin 21 times, the outcome is equally likely to be 21 heads as 20 heads and then 1 tail. These two outcomes are equally as likely as any of the other combinations that can be obtained from 21 flips of a coin. All of the 21-flip combinations will have probabilities equal to 0.521, or 1 in 2,097,152. Assuming that a change in the probability will occur as a result of the outcome of prior flips is incorrect because every outcome of a 21-flip sequence is as likely as the other outcomes. In accordance with Bayes&#x27; theorem, the likely outcome of each flip is the probability of the fair coin, which is .

===Other examples===
The fallacy leads to the incorrect notion that previous failures will create an increased probability of success on subsequent attempts. For a fair 16-sided die, the probability of each outcome occurring is (6.25%). If a win is defined as rolling a 1, the probability of a 1 occurring at least once in 16 rolls is:
:formula_3

The probability of a loss on the first roll is (93.75%). According to the fallacy, the player should have a higher chance of winning after one loss has occurred. The probability of at least one win is now:
:formula_4

By losing one toss, the player&#x27;s probability of winning drops by two percentage points. With 5 losses and 11 rolls remaining, the probability of winning drops to around 0.5 (50%). The probability of at least one win does not increase after a series of losses; indeed, the probability of success &quot;actually decreases&quot;, because there are fewer trials left in which to win. The probability of winning will eventually be equal to the probability of winning a single toss, which is (6.25%) and occurs when only one toss is left.

==Reverse position==

After a consistent tendency towards tails, a gambler may also decide that tails has become a more likely outcome. This is a rational and Bayesian conclusion, bearing in mind the possibility that the coin may not be fair; it is not a fallacy. Believing the odds to favor tails, the gambler sees no reason to change to heads. However, it is a fallacy that a sequence of trials carries a memory of past results which tend to favor or disfavor future outcomes.

The inverse gambler&#x27;s fallacy described by Ian Hacking is a situation where a gambler entering a room and seeing a person rolling a double six on a pair of dice may erroneously conclude that the person must have been rolling the dice for quite a while, as they would be unlikely to get a double six on their first attempt.

==Retrospective gambler&#x27;s fallacy==
Researchers have examined whether a similar bias exists for inferences about unknown past events based upon known subsequent events, calling this the &quot;retrospective gambler&#x27;s fallacy&quot;.

An example of a retrospective gambler&#x27;s fallacy would be to observe multiple successive &quot;heads&quot; on a coin toss and conclude from this that the previously unknown flip was &quot;tails&quot;. Real world examples of retrospective gambler&#x27;s fallacy have been argued to exist in events such as the origin of the Universe. In his book &quot;Universes&quot;, John Leslie argues that &quot;the presence of vastly many universes very different in their characters might be our best explanation for why at least one universe has a life-permitting character&quot;. Daniel M. Oppenheimer and Benoît Monin argue that &quot;In other words, the &#x27;best explanation&#x27; for a low-probability event is that it is only one in a multiple of trials, which is the core intuition of the reverse gambler&#x27;s fallacy.&quot; Philosophical arguments are ongoing about whether such arguments are or are not a fallacy, arguing that the occurrence of our universe says nothing about the existence of other universes or trials of universes. Three studies involving Stanford University students tested the existence of a retrospective gamblers&#x27; fallacy. All three studies concluded that people have a gamblers&#x27; fallacy retrospectively as well as to future events. The authors of all three studies concluded their findings have significant &quot;methodological implications&quot; but may also have &quot;important theoretical implications&quot; that need investigation and research, saying &quot;[a] thorough understanding of such reasoning processes requires that we not only examine how they influence our predictions of the future, but also our perceptions of the past.&quot;

==Childbirth==
In 1796, Pierre-Simon Laplace described in &quot;A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities&quot; the ways in which men calculated their probability of having sons: &quot;I have seen men, ardently desirous of having a son, who could learn only with anxiety of the births of boys in the month when they expected to become fathers. Imagining that the ratio of these births to those of girls ought to be the same at the end of each month, they judged that the boys already born would render more probable the births next of girls.&quot; The expectant fathers feared that if more sons were born in the surrounding community, then they themselves would be more likely to have a daughter. This essay by Laplace is regarded as one of the earliest descriptions of the fallacy. Likewise, after having multiple children of the same sex, some parents may erroneously believe that they are due to have a child of the opposite sex.

==Monte Carlo Casino==
An example of the gambler&#x27;s fallacy occurred in a game of roulette at the Monte Carlo Casino on August 18, 1913, when the ball fell in black 26 times in a row. This was an extremely unlikely occurrence: the probability of a sequence of either red or black occurring 26 times in a row is or around 1 in 66.6 million, assuming the mechanism is unbiased. Gamblers lost millions of francs betting against black, reasoning incorrectly that the streak was causing an imbalance in the randomness of the wheel, and that it had to be followed by a long streak of red.

===Non-independent events===
The gambler&#x27;s fallacy does not apply when the probability of different events is not independent. In such cases, the probability of future events can change based on the outcome of past events, such as the statistical permutation of events. An example is when cards are drawn from a deck without replacement. If an ace is drawn from a deck and not reinserted, the next card drawn is less likely to be an ace and more likely to be of another rank. The probability of drawing another ace, assuming that it was the first card drawn and that there are no jokers, has decreased from (7.69%) to (5.88%), while the probability for each other rank has increased from (7.69%) to (7.84%). This effect allows card counting systems to work in games such as blackjack.

===Bias===
In most illustrations of the gambler&#x27;s fallacy and the reverse gambler&#x27;s fallacy, the trial (e.g. flipping a coin) is assumed to be fair. In practice, this assumption may not hold. For example, if a coin is flipped 21 times, the probability of 21 heads with a fair coin is 1 in 2,097,152. Since this probability is so small, if it happens, it may well be that the coin is somehow biased towards landing on heads, or that it is being controlled by hidden magnets, or similar. In this case, the smart bet is &quot;heads&quot; because Bayesian inference from the empirical evidence — 21 heads in a row — suggests that the coin is likely to be biased toward heads. Bayesian inference can be used to show that when the long-run proportion of different outcomes is unknown but exchangeable (meaning that the random process from which the outcomes are generated may be biased but is equally likely to be biased in any direction) and that previous observations demonstrate the likely direction of the bias, the outcome which has occurred the most in the observed data is the most likely to occur again.

For example, if the &quot;a priori&quot; probability of a biased coin is say 1%, and assuming that such a biased coin would come down heads say 60% of the time, then after 21 heads the probability of a biased coin has increased to about 32%.

The opening scene of the play &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; by Tom Stoppard discusses these issues as one man continually flips heads and the other considers various possible explanations.

===Changing probabilities===
If external factors are allowed to change the probability of the events, the gambler&#x27;s fallacy may not hold. For example, a change in the game rules might favour one player over the other, improving his or her win percentage. Similarly, an inexperienced player&#x27;s success may decrease after opposing teams learn about and play against their weaknesses. This is another example of bias.

==Psychology==

===Origins===
The gambler&#x27;s fallacy arises out of a belief in a law of small numbers, leading to the erroneous belief that small samples must be representative of the larger population. According to the fallacy, streaks must eventually even out in order to be representative. Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman first proposed that the gambler&#x27;s fallacy is a cognitive bias produced by a psychological heuristic called the representativeness heuristic, which states that people evaluate the probability of a certain event by assessing how similar it is to events they have experienced before, and how similar the events surrounding those two processes are. According to this view, &quot;after observing a long run of red on the roulette wheel, for example, most people erroneously believe that black will result in a more representative sequence than the occurrence of an additional red&quot;, so people expect that a short run of random outcomes should share properties of a longer run, specifically in that deviations from average should balance out. When people are asked to make up a random-looking sequence of coin tosses, they tend to make sequences where the proportion of heads to tails stays closer to 0.5 in any short segment than would be predicted by chance, a phenomenon known as insensitivity to sample size. Kahneman and Tversky interpret this to mean that people believe short sequences of random events should be representative of longer ones. The representativeness heuristic is also cited behind the related phenomenon of the clustering illusion, according to which people see streaks of random events as being non-random when such streaks are actually much more likely to occur in small samples than people expect.

The gambler&#x27;s fallacy can also be attributed to the mistaken belief that gambling, or even chance itself, is a fair process that can correct itself in the event of streaks, known as the just-world hypothesis. Other researchers believe that belief in the fallacy may be the result of a mistaken belief in an internal locus of control. When a person believes that gambling outcomes are the result of their own skill, they may be more susceptible to the gambler&#x27;s fallacy because they reject the idea that chance could overcome skill or talent.

===Variations===
Some researchers believe that it is possible to define two types of gambler&#x27;s fallacy: type one and type two. Type one is the classic gambler&#x27;s fallacy, where individuals believe that a particular outcome is due after a long streak of another outcome. Type two gambler&#x27;s fallacy, as defined by Gideon Keren and Charles Lewis, occurs when a gambler underestimates how many observations are needed to detect a favorable outcome, such as watching a roulette wheel for a length of time and then betting on the numbers that appear most often. For events with a high degree of randomness, detecting a bias that will lead to a favorable outcome takes an impractically large amount of time and is very difficult, if not impossible, to do. The two types differ in that type one wrongly assumes that gambling conditions are fair and perfect, while type two assumes that the conditions are biased, and that this bias can be detected after a certain amount of time.

Another variety, known as the retrospective gambler&#x27;s fallacy, occurs when individuals judge that a seemingly rare event must come from a longer sequence than a more common event does. The belief that an imaginary sequence of die rolls is more than three times as long when a set of three sixes is observed as opposed to when there are only two sixes. This effect can be observed in isolated instances, or even sequentially. Another example would involve hearing that a teenager has unprotected sex and becomes pregnant on a given night, and concluding that she has been engaging in unprotected sex for longer than if we hear she had unprotected sex but did not become pregnant, when the probability of becoming pregnant as a result of each intercourse is independent of the amount of prior intercourse.

===Relationship to hot-hand fallacy===
Another psychological perspective states that gambler&#x27;s fallacy can be seen as the counterpart to basketball&#x27;s hot-hand fallacy, in which people tend to predict the same outcome as the previous event - known as positive recency - resulting in a belief that a high scorer will continue to score. In the gambler&#x27;s fallacy, people predict the opposite outcome of the previous event - negative recency - believing that since the roulette wheel has landed on black on the previous six occasions, it is due to land on red the next. Ayton and Fischer have theorized that people display positive recency for the hot-hand fallacy because the fallacy deals with human performance, and that people do not believe that an inanimate object can become &quot;hot.&quot; Human performance is not perceived as random, and people are more likely to continue streaks when they believe that the process generating the results is nonrandom. When a person exhibits the gambler&#x27;s fallacy, they are more likely to exhibit the hot-hand fallacy as well, suggesting that one construct is responsible for the two fallacies.

The difference between the two fallacies is also found in economic decision-making. A study by Huber, Kirchler, and Stockl in 2010 examined how the hot hand and the gambler&#x27;s fallacy are exhibited in the financial market. The researchers gave their participants a choice: they could either bet on the outcome of a series of coin tosses, use an expert opinion to sway their decision, or choose a risk-free alternative instead for a smaller financial reward. Participants turned to the expert opinion to make their decision 24% of the time based on their past experience of success, which exemplifies the hot-hand. If the expert was correct, 78% of the participants chose the expert&#x27;s opinion again, as opposed to 57% doing so when the expert was wrong. The participants also exhibited the gambler&#x27;s fallacy, with their selection of either heads or tails decreasing after noticing a streak of either outcome. This experiment helped bolster Ayton and Fischer&#x27;s theory that people put more faith in human performance than they do in seemingly random processes.

===Neurophysiology===
While the representativeness heuristic and other cognitive biases are the most commonly cited cause of the gambler&#x27;s fallacy, research suggests that there may also be a neurological component. Functional magnetic resonance imaging has shown that after losing a bet or gamble, known as riskloss, the frontoparietal network of the brain is activated, resulting in more risk-taking behavior. In contrast, there is decreased activity in the amygdala, caudate, and ventral striatum after a riskloss. Activation in the amygdala is negatively correlated with gambler&#x27;s fallacy, so that the more activity exhibited in the amygdala, the less likely an individual is to fall prey to the gambler&#x27;s fallacy. These results suggest that gambler&#x27;s fallacy relies more on the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive, goal-directed processes, and less on the brain areas that control affective decision-making.

The desire to continue gambling or betting is controlled by the striatum, which supports a choice-outcome contingency learning method. The striatum processes the errors in prediction and the behavior changes accordingly. After a win, the positive behavior is reinforced and after a loss, the behavior is conditioned to be avoided. In individuals exhibiting the gambler&#x27;s fallacy, this choice-outcome contingency method is impaired, and they continue to make risks after a series of losses.

===Possible solutions===
The gambler&#x27;s fallacy is a deep-seated cognitive bias and can be very hard to overcome. Educating individuals about the nature of randomness has not always proven effective in reducing or eliminating any manifestation of the fallacy. Participants in a study by Beach and Swensson in 1967 were shown a shuffled deck of index cards with shapes on them, and were instructed to guess which shape would come next in a sequence. The experimental group of participants was informed about the nature and existence of the gambler&#x27;s fallacy, and were explicitly instructed not to rely on run dependency to make their guesses. The control group was not given this information. The response styles of the two groups were similar, indicating that the experimental group still based their choices on the length of the run sequence. This led to the conclusion that instructing individuals about randomness is not sufficient in lessening the gambler&#x27;s fallacy.

An individual&#x27;s susceptibility to the gambler&#x27;s fallacy may decrease with age. A study by Fischbein and Schnarch in 1997 administered a questionnaire to five groups: students in grades 5, 7, 9, 11, and college students specializing in teaching mathematics. None of the participants had received any prior education regarding probability. The question asked was: &quot;Ronni flipped a coin three times and in all cases heads came up. Ronni intends to flip the coin again. What is the chance of getting heads the fourth time?&quot; The results indicated that as the students got older, the less likely they were to answer with &quot;smaller than the chance of getting tails&quot;, which would indicate a negative recency effect. 35% of the 5th graders, 35% of the 7th graders, and 20% of the 9th graders exhibited the negative recency effect. Only 10% of the 11th graders answered this way, and none of the college students did. Fischbein and Schnarch theorized that an individual&#x27;s tendency to rely on the representativeness heuristic and other cognitive biases can be overcome with age.

Another possible solution comes from Roney and Trick, Gestalt psychologists who suggest that the fallacy may be eliminated as a result of grouping. When a future event such as a coin toss is described as part of a sequence, no matter how arbitrarily, a person will automatically consider the event as it relates to the past events, resulting in the gambler&#x27;s fallacy. When a person considers every event as independent, the fallacy can be greatly reduced.

Roney and Trick told participants in their experiment that they were betting on either two blocks of six coin tosses, or on two blocks of seven coin tosses. The fourth, fifth, and sixth tosses all had the same outcome, either three heads or three tails. The seventh toss was grouped with either the end of one block, or the beginning of the next block. Participants exhibited the strongest gambler&#x27;s fallacy when the seventh trial was part of the first block, directly after the sequence of three heads or tails. The researchers pointed out that the participants that did not show the gambler&#x27;s fallacy showed less confidence in their bets and bet fewer times than the participants who picked with the gambler&#x27;s fallacy. When the seventh trial was grouped with the second block, and was perceived as not being part of a streak, the gambler&#x27;s fallacy did not occur.

Roney and Trick argued that instead of teaching individuals about the nature of randomness, the fallacy could be avoided by training people to treat each event as if it is a beginning and not a continuation of previous events. They suggested that this would prevent people from gambling when they are losing, in the mistaken hope that their chances of winning are due to increase based on an interaction with previous events.

=== Types of users ===
Within a real-world setting, numerous studies have uncovered that for various decision makers placed in high stakes scenarios, it is likely they will reflect some degree of strong negative autocorrelation in their judgement.

==== Asylum judges ====
In a study aimed at discovering if the negative autocorrelation that exists with the gambler&#x27;s fallacy existed in the decision made by U.S. asylum judges, results showed that after two successive asylum grants, a judge would be 5.5% less likely to approve a third grant.

==== Baseball umpires ====
In the game of baseball, decisions are made every minute. One particular decision made by umpires which is often subject to scrutiny is the &#x27;strike zone&#x27; decision. Whenever a batter does not swing, the umpire must decide if the ball was within a fair region for the batter, known as the strike zone. If outside of this zone, the ball does not count towards outing the batter. In a study of over 12,000 games, results showed that umpires are 1.3% less likely to call a strike if the previous two balls were also strikes.

==== Loan officers ====
In the decision making of loan officers, it can be argued that monetary incentives are a key factor in biased decision making, rendering it harder to examine the gambler&#x27;s fallacy effect. However, research shows that loan officers who are not incentivised by monetary gain are 8% less likely to approve a loan if they approved one for the previous client.

==== Lottery players ====
Lottery play and jackpots entice gamblers around the globe, with the biggest decision for hopeful winners being what numbers to pick. While most people will have their own strategy, evidence shows that after a number is selected as a winner in the current draw, the same number will experience a significant drop in selections in the following lottery. A popular study by Charles Clotfelter and Philip Cook investigated this effect in 1991, where they concluded bettors would cease to select numbers immediately after they were selected, ultimately recovering selection popularity within three months. Soon after, a 1994 study was constructed by Dek Terrell to test the findings of Clotfelter and Cook. The key change in Terrell&#x27;s study was the examination of a pari-mutuel lottery in which, a number selected with lower total wagers placed on it will result in a higher pay-out. While this examination did conclude that players in both types of lotteries exhibited behaviour in-line with the gambler&#x27;s fallacy theory, those who took part in pari-mutuel betting seemed to be less influenced.

The effect the of gambler&#x27;s fallacy can be observed as numbers are chosen far less frequently soon after they are selected as winners, recovering slowly over a two-month period. For example, on the 11th of April 1988, 41 players selected 244 as the winning combination. Three days later only 24 individuals selected 244, a 41.5% decrease. This is the gambler&#x27;s fallacy in motion, as lottery players believe that the occurrence of a winning combination in previous days will decrease its likelihood of occurring today.

====Video game players====
Several video games feature the use of loot boxes, a collection of in-game items awarded on opening with random contents set by rarity metrics, as a monetization scheme. Since around 2018, loot boxes have come under scrutiny from governments and advocates on the basis they are akin to gambling, particularly for games aimed at youth. Some games use a special &quot;pity-timer&quot; mechanism, that if the player has opened several loot boxes in a row without obtaining a high-rarity item, subsequent loot boxes will improve the odds of a higher-rate item drop. This is considered to feed into the gambler&#x27;s fallacy since it reinforces the idea that a player will eventually obtain a high-rarity item (a win) after only receiving common items from a string of previous loot boxes.

<text>Gasparo Contarini (16 October 1483 – 24 August 1542) was an Italian diplomat, cardinal, and Bishop of Belluno. He advocated for dialogue with Protestants during the Reformation. Born in Venice, he served as the Republic&#x27;s ambassador to Charles V during its war with him. He was the first to explain the time discrepancy in the Magellan–Elcano circumnavigation due to Earth&#x27;s rotation. He participated in diplomatic efforts and reconciliations, and became a cardinal, even though he was initially a layman. Contarini was a leader in the reform movement within the Roman Catholic Church. He played a role in the papal approval of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). He was also involved in attempts to restore religious unity in Germany.

Contarini&#x27;s work, &quot;De magistratibus et republica venetorum&quot;, praised the Venetian government system for its harmony, fairness, and stability. He described the electoral process, particularly the lottery system for choosing officials, emphasizing fairness and equality. Contarini&#x27;s depiction of the Doge, Venice&#x27;s leader, highlighted the balance between symbolic monarchy and the power of civic institutions. He portrayed the Doge as both a regal figure and a representative of the city&#x27;s republican governance. Contarini&#x27;s writings aimed to glorify the republican nature of Venice while showcasing its ceremonial and symbolic elements.

==Biography==
He was born in Venice, the eldest son of Alvise Contarini, of the ancient noble House of Contarini, and his wife Polissena Malpiero. After a thorough scientific and philosophical training at the University of Padua, he began his career in the service of his native city. From September 1520 to August 1525 he was the Republic&#x27;s ambassador to Charles V, with whom Venice was soon at war, instructed to defend the Republic&#x27;s alliance with Francis I of France. Though he participated at the Diet of Worms, April 1521, he never saw or spoke with Martin Luther. He accompanied Charles in the Netherlands and Spain.

Contarini was in Spain when the Magellan–Elcano circumnavigation returned in 1522, bringing with them a cargo of spices from the East as well as a scientific curiosity. Although the sailors had carefully recorded every day of the three-year journey since they left Seville, the ship&#x27;s log was one day earlier than the actual date when they returned to Seville. Contarini was the first European to give a correct explanation of this phenomenon. Since the ship had sailed westward around the world, in the same direction as the apparent motion of the sun in the sky, the sailors had experienced one fewer sunrise than a stationary observer.

He participated at the Congress of Ferrara in 1526 as the Republic&#x27;s representative; at the Congress the League of Cognac was formed against the Emperor, allying France with Venice and several states of Italy. Later, after the Sack of Rome (1527), he assisted in reconciling the emperor with Clement VII, whose release he had obtained, and with the Republic of Bologna. Upon his return to Venice, he was made a senator and a member of the Great Council.
===Spirituality===
According to historian Constance Furey, Contarini &quot;was representative of a European-wide phenomenon associated with names such as Erasmus, Thomas More and Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples, people who combined an Erasmian critique of the established church and ritualism with an interest in biblical scholarship as a means of cultivating internal piety,&quot; each with no thought of leaving the Catholic church.

In a letter to encourage a missed friend who had become a hermit, Contarini late recounted an event in 1511 where, following Confession with a wise and holy monk, he had a peace-giving epiphany that reliance on penances and heroic asceticism was not necessary for salvation, instead of simple faith, hope and charity: Christ&#x27;s passion was &quot;more than sufficient.&quot; This has been likened by some historians as a similar event to Luther&#x27;s &quot;tower experience&quot; and some historians even ascribe Lutheran views to Contarini, however the parallels are disputed by other historians.

===Cardinalate===

In 1535, Paul III unexpectedly made the secular diplomat a cardinal in order to bind an able man of evangelical disposition to the Roman interests. Contarini accepted, but in his new position did not exhibit his former independence. At the time he was promoted to cardinal, May 21, 1535, he was still a layman. However, already in October 1536 he was appointed Bishop of Belluno. One of the fruits of his diplomatic activity is his &quot;De magistratibus et republica Venetorum&quot;.

As Cardinal, Contarini figured among the most prominent of the &quot;Spirituali&quot;, the leaders of the movement for reform within the Roman church. In April 1536 Paul III appointed a commission to devise ways for a reformation, with Contarini presiding. Paul III received favorably Contarini&#x27;s &quot;Consilium de Emendanda Ecclesia&quot;, which was circulated among the cardinalate, but it remained a dead letter. Contarini in a letter to his friend Cardinal Reginald Pole (dated 11 November 1538) says that his hopes had been wakened anew by the pope&#x27;s attitude. He and his friends, who formed the Catholic evangelical movement of the Spirituali, thought that all would have been done when the abuses in church life had been put away. What Contarini had to do with it is shown by his letters to the pope in which he complained of the schism in the church, of simony and flattery in the papal court, and the dangers of a papal &quot;fiat&quot; monarchy, its least grateful passages. Paul&#x27;s successor Paul IV, once a member on the same 1536 commission and fellow &quot;spirituali&quot;, put it on the new &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot;.

In 1541 Cardinal Contarini was papal legate at the Conference of Regensburg, the diet and religious debate marking the culmination of attempts to restore religious unity in Germany by means of conferences. There everything was unfavorable; the Catholic states were bitter, the Evangelicals were distant. Contarini&#x27;s instructions though apparently free were in fact full of papal reservations. But the papal party had gladly sent him, thinking that through him a union in doctrine could be brought about, while the interest of Rome could be attended to later. Though the princes stood aloof, the theologians and the emperor were for peace, so the main articles were put forth in a formula, Evangelical in thought and Catholic in expression. The papal legate had revised the Catholic proposal and assented to the formula agreed upon. All gave their approval, even Johann Eck, though he later regretted it.

Contarini&#x27;s theological advisor was Tommaso Badia; his own position is shown in a treatise on justification, composed at Regensburg, which in essential points is Evangelical, differing only in the omission of the negative side and in being interwoven with the teaching of Aquinas. Meanwhile, the papal policy had changed, and Contarini chose to follow this. He advised the emperor, after the conference had broken up, not to renew it, but to submit everything to the pope.

Ignatius Loyola acknowledged that Cardinal Contarini was largely responsible for the papal approbation of the Society of Jesus, on September 27, 1540. Meanwhile, Rome had drifted further into reaction, and Contarini died while legate at Bologna, at a time when the Inquisition had driven many of his friends and fellows in conviction into exile.
==The Commonwealth and Government of Venice==

Contarini&#x27;s book &quot;De magistratibus et republica venetorum&quot; (Paris, 1543) is an important source for the study of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Venice&#x27;s unique system of government. It was published in an English translation in 1599. This magisterial work, written during his time as an ambassador to Charles V, extols the various institutions of the Venetian state in a manner designed to emphasize harmony, fairness and serenity. Historians have demonstrated that this text represents Contarini&#x27;s idealization of Venetian reality. Probably written for a foreign, courtly audience, this work functions as the source for the everlasting propagation of the &quot;myth of Venice&quot; as a stable, unchanging and prosperous society.

His depiction of how members of the council were elected to the senate, for example, aimed to emphasise the way the electoral system prevented factionalism from occurring, instead making sure that “public benefits are largely extended among the citizens” rather than narrowly amongst “one family” . An elaborate lottery is described as giving the maximum amount of chance in appointing patricians to particular offices, and care is taken to point out if two of one family are standing for similar posts. Fairness is further emphasised in Contarini&#x27;s constant references to the equality the members of the council enjoyed. They “sit down where it pleases them, for there is no place appointed to any”, and they “with oath promise to do their utmost diligence, that the laws may be observed” . He creates an image of disparate individuals, with factions broken up by the guiding hand of the law, working to ensure those in positions of importance are fairly chosen from their number and without the capacity to serve the interests of a smaller group.

Contarini&#x27;s depiction of the Doge lucidly demonstrates the way in which this figure embodies both the conscious illusion of a resplendent monarchical ruler and an equally conscious demonstration of a regime that wishes to portray itself as ruled by many limiting the powers of one. This calculated duality means that Contarini&#x27;s doge, which the second book of De magistratibus is almost entirely devoted to discussing, represents the closest point in his text to what actually occurred, because the Doge served as a literal embodiment of the idealisation of the reality of Venetian politics. For Contarini, this duality almost defines the greatness of the Venetian constitution. The Doge is the “heart”, under which “all are comprised” . Contarini places him in the centre of his body metaphor, making him synecdochical for the city and the people that reside within it. This means he is to ensure that the disparate, competing interests of the city beat in time with one another, creating in the process the “perfection of civil agreement”. His job as a conductor, rather than a ruler, means therefore that the role takes on the aspect of representative of the entire city. Contarini&#x27;s description of his vestments, privileges and rituals can therefore be compared to Marin Sanudo’s description of the physical spaces of Venice in his essay &quot;In Praise of Venice&quot;. Both are designed to extol the virtues of the entire city by describing representative parts. This is apparent in the way both authors treat the chapel of St. Mark. Patron saints were hugely important in terms of civic self-identification in renaissance Italy . Contarini emphasizes this, saying that he is “with exceeding honour solemnized of the Venetians” . His description of the Doge&#x27;s close relationship with the saint, through the “solemn pomp” with which he attends mass at the saint&#x27;s chapel, attaches him to the aforementioned “exceeding honour”, in a similar fashion to the way in which Sanudo glorifies Venice as a whole by constantly referring to the beauty and worth of St. Mark&#x27;s square and chapel as part of his panoramic praise of the city.

At the same time, however, Contarini&#x27;s overall purpose is, of course, the glorification of the republican nature of his city. Therefore, he cannot avoid referring to “the other side” of the Doge&#x27;s figure when discussing his “royal appearing show” . Things like the “kingly ornaments” which were “always purple garments or cloth of gold”, both very ostentatious assertions of wealth and power, were to ensure he was “recompensed” for his “limitation of authority” . Contarini thus openly concludes that the Doge is a combination of myth and reality, saying that “in everything you may see the show of a king, but his authority is nothing” . Indeed, as Edward Muir points out, “by the sixteenth century virtually every word, gesture and act that the doge made in public was subject to legal and ceremonial regulation” . He could not buy expensive jewels, own property outside Venice or the Veneto, display his insignia outside the Ducal Palace, decorate his apartment as he wanted, receive people in his ducal dress, send official letters, or have close ties with guilds, amongst a great many other restrictions. Legally, therefore, power in Venice came from the numerous councils, not the figurehead. The Doge thus becomes a brazen republican statement. Venice drew attention to a princely, magnificently adorned figurehead, only to direct most executive power to councils of her citizens.

<text>Gastroenterology (from the Greek gastḗr- &quot;belly&quot;, -énteron &quot;intestine&quot;, and -logía &quot;study of&quot;) is the branch of medicine focused on the digestive system and its disorders. The digestive system consists of the gastrointestinal tract, sometimes referred to as the &quot;GI tract,&quot; which includes the esophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine as well as the accessory organs of digestion which include the pancreas, gallbladder, and liver.

The digestive system functions to move material through the GI tract via peristalsis, break down that material via digestion, absorb nutrients for use throughout the body, and remove waste from the body via defecation. Physicians who specialize in the medical specialty of gastroenterology are called gastroenterologists or sometimes &quot;GI doctors&quot;.

Some of the most common conditions managed by gastroenterologists include gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which includes Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis, peptic ulcer disease, gallbladder and biliary tract disease, hepatitis, pancreatitis, colitis, colon polyps and cancer, nutritional problems, and many more.

== History ==

Citing from Egyptian papyri, John F. Nunn identified significant knowledge of gastrointestinal diseases among practicing physicians during the periods of the pharaohs. Irynakhty, of the tenth dynasty, 2125 B.C., was a court physician specializing in gastroenterology, sleeping, and proctology.

Among ancient Greeks, Hippocrates attributed digestion to concoction. Galen&#x27;s concept of the stomach having four &quot;faculties&quot; was widely accepted up to modernity in the seventeenth century.

=== 18th century ===
* Italian Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729–99) was among early physicians to disregard Galen&#x27;s theories, and in 1780 he gave experimental proof on the action of gastric juice on foodstuffs.
* In 1767, German Johann von Zimmermann wrote an important work on dysentery.
* In 1777, Maximilian Stoll of Vienna described cancer of the gallbladder.

=== 19th century ===
* In 1805, Philipp Bozzini made the first attempt to observe inside the living human body using a tube he named &quot;Lichtleiter&quot; (light-guiding instrument) to examine the urinary tract, the rectum, and the pharynx. This is the earliest description of endoscopy.
* Charles Emile Troisier described enlargement of lymph nodes in abdominal cancer.
* In 1823, William Prout discovered that stomach juices contain hydrochloric acid.
* In 1833, William Beaumont published &quot;Experiments and Observations on the Gastric Juice and the Physiology of Digestion&quot; following years of experimenting on test subject Alexis St. Martin.
* In 1868, Adolf Kussmaul, a well-known German physician, developed the gastroscope. He perfected the technique on a sword swallower.
* In 1871, at the society of physicians in Vienna, Carl Stoerk demonstrated an esophagoscope made of two telescopic metal tubes, initially devised by Waldenburg in 1870.
* In 1876, Karl Wilhelm von Kupffer described the properties of some liver cells now called Kupffer cells.
* In 1883, Hugo Kronecker and Samuel James Meltzer studied oesophageal manometry in humans.
=== 20th century ===
* In 1915, Jesse McClendon tested acidity of human stomach &quot;in situ&quot;.
* In 1921–22, Walter Alvarez did the first electrogastrography research.
* Rudolf Schindler described many important diseases involving the human digestive system during World War I in his illustrated textbook and is portrayed by some as the &quot;father of gastroscopy&quot;. He and Georg Wolf developed a semiflexible gastroscope in 1932.
* In 1932, Burrill Bernard Crohn described Crohn&#x27;s disease.
* In 1957, Basil Hirschowitz introduced the first prototype of a fibreoptic gastroscope.

=== 21st century ===
* In 2005, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren of Australia were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; (1982/1983) and its role in peptic ulcer disease. James Leavitt assisted in their research, but the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously so he was not included in the award.

== Procedures ==

=== Colonoscopy ===
A procedure using a long thin tube with a camera that is passed through the anus to visualize the rectum and the entire length of the colon. The procedure is performed either to look for colon polyps and/or colon cancer in somebody without symptoms, referred to as screening, or to further evaluate symptoms including rectal bleeding, dark tarry stools, change in bowel habits or stool consistency (diarrhea, pencil-thin stool), abdominal pain, and unexplained weight loss. Before the procedure, the physician might ask the patient to stop taking certain medications including blood thinners, aspirin, diabetes medications, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A bowel prep is usually taken the night before and into the morning of the procedure which consists of an enema or laxatives, either pills or powder dissolved in liquid, that will cause diarrhea. The procedure might need to be stopped and rescheduled if there is stool remaining in the colon due to an incomplete bowel prep because the physician can not adequately visualize the colon. During the procedure, the patient is sedated and the scope is used to examine the entire length of the colon looking for polyps, bleeding, or abnormal tissue. A biopsy or polyp removal can then be performed and the tissue sent to the lab for evaluation. The procedure usually takes thirty minutes to an hour followed by a one to two hour observation period. Complications include bloating, cramping, a reaction to anesthesia, bleeding, and a hole through the wall of the colon that may require repeat colonoscopy or surgery. Signs of a serious complication requiring urgent or emergent medical attention include severe pain in the abdomen, fever, bleeding that does not improve, dizziness, and weakness.

=== Sigmoidoscopy ===
A procedure similar to a colonoscopy using a long thin tube with a camera (scope) passed through the anus but only intended to visualize the rectum and the last part of the colon closest to the rectum. All aspects of the procedure are the same as for a colonoscopy with the exception that this procedure only lasts ten to twenty minutes and is done without sedation. This usually allows for the patient to return to normal activities immediately after the procedure is finished.

=== Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) ===
A procedure using a long thin tube with a camera that is passed through the mouth to view the esophagus (&quot;esophago-&quot;), stomach (&quot;gastro-&quot;), and the duodenum (&quot;duodeno-&quot;). It is also referred to as upper endoscopy or just endoscopy. The procedure is performed for further evaluation of symptoms including persistent heartburn, indigestion, vomiting blood, dark tarry stools, persistent nausea and vomiting, pain, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, and unexplained weight loss. It is also performed for further testing following a lab test that shows low hemoglobin levels without a known cause or an abnormal barium swallow. The procedure can be used to diagnose many disorders through direct visualization or tissue biopsy including esophageal varices, esophageal strictures, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, cancer, celiac disease, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and a H. pylori infection. Intra-operative techniques can then be used for treatment of certain disorders like banding esophageal varices or dilating esophageal strictures. The patient will likely be required to not eat or drink anything starting 4 hours prior to the procedure. Sedation is usually required for patient comfort. This procedure usually lasts around thirty minutes followed by a one to two hour observation period. Side effects include bloating, nausea, and a sore throat for 1 to 2 days. Complications are rare but include reaction to the anesthesia, bleeding, and a hole through the wall of the esophagus, stomach, or small intestine which could require surgery. Signs of a serious complication requiring urgent or emergent medical attention include chest pain, problems breathing, problems swallowing, throat pain that gets worse, vomiting with blood or the appearance of &quot;coffee-grounds&quot;, worsening abdominal pain, bloody or black tarry stool, and fever.

=== Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) ===
A procedure using a long thin tube with a camera passed through the mouth into the first part of the small intestine to locate, diagnose, and treat disorders related to the bile and pancreatic ducts. These ducts carry fluids that help with digesting food from the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas and can become narrowed or blocked as a result of gallstones, infection, inflammation, pancreatic pseudocysts, and tumors of the bile ducts or pancreas. As a result, one may experience back pain, yellowing of the skin, and an abnormal lab test showing an elevated bilirubin level which could necessitate this procedure. However, the procedure is not recommended if the patient has acute pancreatitis unless the level of bilirubin remains high or is increasing which could suggest the blockage is still present. The patient will likely be required to not eat or drink anything starting 8 hours prior to the procedure. After the patient is sedated, the physician will pass the scope through the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and into the duodenum to locate the opening where the ducts drain into the small intestine. The physician can then inject dye into these ducts and take X-rays which show a real time view, via fluoroscopy, allowing the physician to locate and relieve the blockage. This is done through multiple techniques including cutting the opening and creating a bigger hole for drainage, removing gallstones and other debris, dilating narrow parts of the ducts, or placing a stent which keeps the ducts open. The physician can also take a biopsy of the ducts to evaluate for cancer, infection, or inflammation. Side effects include bloating, nausea, or a sore throat for one to two days. Complications include pancreatitis, infection of the bile ducts or gallbladder, bleeding, reaction to the anesthesia, and perforation of any structures that the scope or its instruments pass but particularly the duodenum, bile duct, and pancreatic duct. Signs of a serious complication requiring urgent or emergent medical attention include bloody or black tarry stool, chest pain, fever, worsening abdominal pain, worsening throat pain, problems breathing, problems swallowing, vomit that is bloody or looks like coffee-grounds. Most of the time complications from this procedure require hospitalization for treatment.

== Disorders ==

=== Esophagus ===

==== Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) ====
A condition that is a result of stomach contents consistently coming back up into the esophagus causing troublesome symptoms or complications. Symptoms are considered troublesome based on how disruptive they are to a patient&#x27;s daily life and well-being. This definition was standardized by the Montreal Consensus in 2006. Symptoms include a painful feeling in the middle of the chest and feeling stomach contents coming back up into the mouth. Other symptoms include chest pain, nausea, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, coughing, and hoarseness. Risk factors include obesity, pregnancy, smoking, hiatal hernia, certain medications, and certain foods. Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and medical history, with further testing only after treatment has been ineffective. Further diagnosis can be achieved by measuring how much acid enters the esophagus or looking into the esophagus with a scope. Treatment and management options include lifestyle modifications, medications, and surgery if there is no improvement with other interventions. Lifestyle modifications include not lying down for three hours after eating, lying down on the left side, elevating head while laying by elevating head of the bed or using extra pillows, losing weight, stopping smoking, and avoiding coffee, mint, alcohol, chocolate, fatty foods, acidic foods, and spicy foods. Medications include antacids, proton pump inhibitors, H2 receptor blockers. Surgery is usually a Nissen fundoplication and is performed by a surgeon. Complications of longstanding GERD can include inflammation of the esophagus that may cause bleeding or ulcer formation, narrowing of the esophagus leading to swallowing issues, a change in the lining of the esophagus that can increase the chances of developing cancer (Barrett&#x27;s esophagus), chronic cough, asthma, inflammation of the larynx leading to hoarseness, and wearing away of tooth enamel leading to dental issues.

==== Barrett&#x27;s esophagus ====

A condition in which the lining of the esophagus changes to look more like the lining of the intestine and increases the risk of developing esophageal cancer. There are no specific symptoms although symptoms of GERD may be present for years prior as it is associated with a 10–15% risk of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus. Risk factors include chronic GERD for more than 5 years, being age 50 or older, being non-Hispanic white, being male, having a family history of this disorder, belly fat, and a history of smoking. Protective factors include H. pylori infection, frequent use of aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and diets high in fruits and vegetables. Diagnosis can be made by looking into the esophagus with a scope and possibly taking a biopsy of the lining of the esophagus. Treatment includes managing GERD, destroying abnormal parts of the esophagus, removing abnormal tissue in the esophagus, and removing part of the esophagus as performed by a general surgeon. Further management could include periodic surveillance with repeat scopes at certain intervals determined by the physician, likely not more frequently than every three to five years. Complications from this disorder can result in a type of cancer called esophageal adenocarcinoma.

== Education and training ==

=== United States ===
Gastroenterology is a subspecialty of internal medicine and therefore requires three years of internal medicine residency training followed by three additional years in a dedicated gastroenterology fellowship. This training is certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) and the American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine (AOBIM) and must be completed at a program accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). Other national societies that oversee training include the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE).

== Scope of practice ==
Gastroenterologists see patients both in the clinic and the hospital setting. They can order diagnostic tests, prescribe medications, and perform a number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures including colonoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and liver biopsy.

=== Subspecialties ===
Some gastroenterology trainees will complete a &quot;fourth-year&quot; (although this is often their seventh year of graduate medical education) in transplant hepatology, advanced interventional endoscopy, inflammatory bowel disease, motility, or other topics.

Advanced endoscopy, sometimes called interventional or surgical endoscopy, is a sub-specialty of gastroenterology that focuses on advanced endoscopic techniques for the treatment of pancreatic, hepatobiliary, and gastrointestinal disease. Interventional gastroenterologists typically undergo an additional year of rigorous training in advanced endoscopic techniques including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic ultrasound-guided diagnostic and interventional procedures, and advanced resection techniques including endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection. Additionally, the performance of endoscopic bariatric procedures is also performed by some advanced endoscopists.

Hepatology, or hepatobiliary medicine, encompasses the study of the liver, pancreas, and biliary tree, and is traditionally considered a sub-specialty of gastroenterology, while proctology encompasses disorders of the anus, rectum, and colon and is considered a sub-specialty of general surgery.

<text>The Gulag was a system of forced labor camps in the Soviet Union. The word &quot;Gulag&quot; originally referred only to the division of the Soviet secret police that was in charge of running the forced labor camps from the 1930s to the early 1950s during Joseph Stalin&#x27;s rule, but in English literature the term is popularly used for the system of forced labor throughout the Soviet era. The abbreviation GULAG (ГУЛАГ) stands for &quot;Гла́вное Управле́ние исправи́тельно-трудовы́х ЛАГере́й&quot; (Main Directorate of Correctional Labour Camps), but the full official name of the agency changed several times.

The Gulag is recognized as a major instrument of political repression in the Soviet Union. The camps housed both ordinary criminals and political prisoners, a large number of whom were convicted by simplified procedures, such as NKVD troikas or other instruments of extrajudicial punishment. The agency was established in 1930 and initially was administered by the OGPU (1923–1934), later known as the NKVD (1934–1946), and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) in the final years. 

The internment system grew rapidly, reaching a population of 100,000 in the 1920s. By the end of 1940, the population of the Gulag camps amounted to 1.5 million. The emergent consensus among scholars is that, of the 14 million prisoners who passed through the Gulag camps and the 4 million prisoners who passed through the Gulag colonies from 1930 to 1953, roughly 1.5 to 1.7 million prisoners perished there or died soon after they were released. Some journalists and writers who question the reliability of such data heavily rely on memoir sources that come to higher estimations. Archival researchers have found &quot;no plan of destruction&quot; of the gulag population and no statement of official intent to kill them, and prisoner releases vastly exceeded the number of deaths in the Gulag. This policy can partially be attributed to the common practice of releasing prisoners who were suffering from incurable diseases as well as prisoners who were near death.

Almost immediately after the death of Stalin, the Soviet establishment started to dismantle the Gulag system. A mass general amnesty was granted in the immediate aftermath of Stalin&#x27;s death, but it was only offered to non-political prisoners and political prisoners who had been sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison. Shortly thereafter, Nikita Khrushchev was elected First Secretary, initiating the processes of de-Stalinization and the Khrushchev Thaw, triggering a mass release and rehabilitation of political prisoners. Six years later, on 25 January 1960, the Gulag system was officially abolished when the remains of its administration were dissolved by Khrushchev. The legal practice of sentencing convicts to penal labor continues to exist in the Russian Federation, but its capacity is greatly reduced.

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, who survived eight years of Gulag incarceration, gave the term its international repute with the publication of &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; in 1973. The author likened the scattered camps to &quot;a chain of islands&quot;, and as an eyewitness, he described the Gulag as a system where people were worked to death. In March 1940, there were 53 Gulag camp directorates (simply referred to as &quot;camps&quot;) and 423 labor colonies in the Soviet Union. Many mining and industrial towns and cities in northern Russia, eastern Russia and Kazakhstan such as Karaganda, Norilsk, Vorkuta and Magadan, were blocks of camps which were originally built by prisoners and subsequently run by ex-prisoners.

== Etymology ==

GULAG (ГУЛАГ) stands for &quot;Гла́вное управле́ние исправи́тельно-трудовы́х лагере́й&quot; (Main Directorate of Correctional Labour Camps). It was renamed several times, e.g., to Main Directorate of Correctional Labor Colonies (), which names can be seen in the documents describing the subordination of various camps.

== Overview ==

Some historians estimate that 14 million people were imprisoned in the Gulag labor camps from 1929 to 1953 (the estimates for the period from 1918 to 1929 are more difficult to calculate). Other calculations, by historian Orlando Figes, refer to 25 million prisoners of the Gulag in 1928–1953. A further 6–7 million were deported and exiled to remote areas of the USSR, and 4–5 million passed through labor colonies, plus who were already in, or had been sent to, labor settlements.

According to some estimates, the total population of the camps varied from 510,307 in 1934 to 1,727,970 in 1953. According to other estimates, at the beginning of 1953 the total number of prisoners in prison camps was more than 2.4 million of which more than 465,000 were political prisoners. Between the years 1934 to 1953, 20% to 40% of the Gulag population in each given year were released.

The institutional analysis of the Soviet concentration system is complicated by the formal distinction between GULAG and GUPVI. GUPVI (ГУПВИ) was the Main Administration for Affairs of Prisoners of War and Internees (, ), a department of NKVD (later MVD) in charge of handling of foreign civilian internees and POWs (prisoners of war) in the Soviet Union during and in the aftermath of World War II (1939–1953). In many ways the GUPVI system was similar to GULAG.

Its major function was the organization of foreign forced labor in the Soviet Union. The top management of GUPVI came from the GULAG system. The major memoir noted distinction from GULAG was the absence of convicted criminals in the GUPVI camps. Otherwise the conditions in both camp systems were similar: hard labor, poor nutrition and living conditions, and high mortality rate.

For the Soviet political prisoners, like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, all foreign civilian detainees and foreign POWs were imprisoned in the GULAG; the surviving foreign civilians and POWs considered themselves prisoners in the GULAG. According to the estimates, in total, during the whole period of the existence of the GUPVI, there were over 500 POW camps (within the Soviet Union and abroad), which imprisoned over 4,000,000 POW. Most Gulag inmates were not political prisoners, although significant numbers of political prisoners could be found in the camps at any one time.

Petty crimes and jokes about the Soviet government and officials were punishable by imprisonment. About half of political prisoners in the Gulag camps were imprisoned &quot;by administrative means&quot;, i.e., without trial at courts; official data suggest that there were over 2.6 million sentences to imprisonment on cases investigated by the secret police throughout 1921–53. Maximum sentences varied depending on the type of crime and changed over time. From 1953, the maximum sentence for petty theft was six months, having previously been one year and seven years. Theft of state property however, had a minimum sentence of seven years and a maximum of twenty five. In 1958, the maximum sentence for any crime was reduced from twenty five to fifteen years.

In 1960, the Ministerstvo Vnutrennikh Del (MVD) ceased to function as the Soviet-wide administration of the camps in favour of individual republic MVD branches. The centralised detention administrations temporarily ceased functioning.

== Contemporary usage of the word and the usage of other terms ==

Although the term &quot;Gulag&quot; was originally used in reference to a government agency, in English and many other languages, the acronym acquired the qualities of a common noun, denoting &quot;the Soviet system of prison-based, unfree labor&quot;.

Even more broadly, &quot;Gulag&quot; has come to mean the Soviet repressive system itself, the set of procedures that prisoners once called the &quot;meat-grinder&quot;: the arrests, the interrogations, the transport in unheated cattle cars, the forced labor, the destruction of families, the years spent in exile, the early and unnecessary deaths.

Western authors use the term &quot;Gulag&quot; to denote all the prisons and internment camps in the Soviet Union. The term&#x27;s contemporary usage is at times notably not directly related to the USSR, such as in the expression &quot;North Korea&#x27;s Gulag&quot; for camps operational today.

The word &quot;Gulag&quot; was not often used in Russian, either officially or colloquially; the predominant terms were &quot;the camps&quot; (лагеря, &quot;lagerya&quot;) and &quot;the zone&quot; (зона, &quot;zona&quot;), usually singular, for the labor camp system and for the individual camps. The official term, &quot;correctional labour camp&quot;, was suggested for official use by the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the session of July 27, 1929.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The Tsar and the Russian Empire both used forced exile and forced labour as forms of judicial punishment. Katorga, a category of punishment which was reserved for those who were convicted of the most serious crimes, had many of the features which were associated with labor-camp imprisonment: confinement, simplified facilities (as opposed to the facilities which existed in prisons), and forced labor, usually involving hard, unskilled or semi-skilled work. According to historian Anne Applebaum, katorga was not a common sentence; approximately 6,000 katorga convicts were serving sentences in 1906 and 28,600 of them were serving sentences in 1916. Under the Imperial Russian penal system, those who were convicted of less serious crimes were sent to corrective prisons and they were also made to work.

Forced exile to Siberia had been in use for a wide range of offenses since the seventeenth century and it was a common punishment for political dissidents and revolutionaries. In the nineteenth century, the members of the failed Decembrist revolt and Polish nobles who resisted Russian rule were sent into exile. Fyodor Dostoevsky was sentenced to die for reading banned literature in 1849, but the sentence was commuted to banishment to Siberia. Members of various socialist revolutionary groups, including Bolsheviks such as Sergo Ordzhonikidze, Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, and Joseph Stalin were also sent into exile.

Convicts who were serving labor sentences and exiles were sent to the underpopulated areas of Siberia and the Russian Far East – regions that lacked towns or food sources as well as organized transportation systems. Despite the isolated conditions, some prisoners successfully escaped to populated areas. Stalin himself escaped three of the four times after he was sent into exile. Since these times, Siberia gained its fearful connotation as a place of punishment, a reputation which was further enhanced by the Soviet GULAG system. The Bolsheviks&#x27; own experiences with exile and forced labor provided them with a model which they could base their own system on, including the importance of strict enforcement.

From 1920 to 1950, the leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet state considered repression a tool that they should use to secure the normal functioning of the Soviet state system and preserve and strengthen their positions within their social base, the working class (when the Bolsheviks took power, peasants represented 80% of the population).

In the midst of the Russian Civil War, Lenin and the Bolsheviks established a &quot;special&quot; prison camp system, separate from its traditional prison system and under the control of the Cheka. These camps, as Lenin envisioned them, had a distinctly political purpose. These early camps of the GULAG system were introduced in order to isolate and eliminate class-alien, socially dangerous, disruptive, suspicious, and other disloyal elements, whose deeds and thoughts were not contributing to the strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Forced labor as a &quot;method of reeducation&quot; was applied in the Solovki prison camp as early as the 1920s, based on Trotsky&#x27;s experiments with forced labor camps for Czech war prisoners from 1918 and his proposals to introduce &quot;compulsory labor service&quot; voiced in &quot;Terrorism and Communism&quot;. These concentration camps were not identical to the Stalinist or Hitler camps, but were introduced to isolate war prisoners given the extreme historical situation following World War I.

Various categories of prisoners were defined: petty criminals, POWs of the Russian Civil War, officials accused of corruption, sabotage and embezzlement, political enemies, dissidents and other people deemed dangerous for the state. In the first decade of Soviet rule, the judicial and penal systems were neither unified nor coordinated, and there was a distinction between criminal prisoners and political or &quot;special&quot; prisoners.

The &quot;traditional&quot; judicial and prison system, which dealt with criminal prisoners, were first overseen by The People&#x27;s Commissariat of Justice until 1922, after which they were overseen by the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Internal Affairs, also known as the NKVD. The Cheka and its successor organizations, the GPU or State Political Directorate and the OGPU, oversaw political prisoners and the &quot;special&quot; camps to which they were sent. In April 1929, the judicial distinctions between criminal and political prisoners were eliminated, and control of the entire Soviet penal system turned over to the OGPU. In 1928, there were 30,000 individuals interned; the authorities were opposed to compelled labor. In 1927, the official in charge of prison administration wrote:

The exploitation of prison labour, the system of squeezing &quot;golden sweat&quot; from them, the organisation of production in places of confinement, which while profitable from a commercial point of view is fundamentally lacking in corrective significance – these are entirely inadmissible in Soviet places of confinement.

The legal base and the guidance for the creation of the system of &quot;corrective labor camps&quot; (, ), the backbone of what is commonly referred to as the &quot;Gulag&quot;, was a secret decree from the Sovnarkom of July 11, 1929, about the use of penal labor that duplicated the corresponding appendix to the minutes of the Politburo meeting of June 27, 1929.

One of the Gulag system founders was Naftaly Frenkel. In 1923, he was arrested for illegally crossing borders and smuggling. He was sentenced to 10 years&#x27; hard labor at Solovki, which later came to be known as the &quot;first camp of the Gulag&quot;. While serving his sentence he wrote a letter to the camp administration detailing a number of &quot;productivity improvement&quot; proposals including the infamous system of labor exploitation whereby the inmates&#x27; food rations were to be linked to their rate of production, a proposal known as nourishment scale (шкала питания). This notorious you-eat-as-you-work system would often kill weaker prisoners in weeks and caused countless casualties. The letter caught the attention of a number of high communist officials including Genrikh Yagoda and Frenkel soon went from being an inmate to becoming a camp commander and an important Gulag official. His proposals soon saw widespread adoption in the Gulag system.

After having appeared as an instrument and place for isolating counter-revolutionary and criminal elements, the Gulag, because of its principle of &quot;correction by forced labor&quot;, quickly became, in fact, an independent branch of the national economy secured on the cheap labor force presented by prisoners. Hence it is followed by one more important reason for the constancy of the repressive policy, namely, the state&#x27;s interest in unremitting rates of receiving a cheap labor force that was forcibly used, mainly in the extreme conditions of the east and north. The Gulag possessed both punitive and economic functions.

=== Formation and expansion during Stalin&#x27;s rule ===
The Gulag was an administrative body that watched over the camps; eventually, its name would retrospectively be used as a name for these camps. After Lenin&#x27;s death in 1924, Stalin was able to take control of the government, and he began to form the gulag system. On June 27, 1929, the Politburo created a system of self-supporting camps that would eventually replace the existing prisons around the country. Prisoners who received a prison sentence which exceeded three years were required to remain in these prisons. Prisoners who received a prison sentence which was shorter than three years were required to remain in the prison system that was still under the purview of the NKVD.

The purpose of these new camps was to colonise the remote and inhospitable environments throughout the Soviet Union. These changes took place around the time when Stalin started to institute collectivization and rapid industrial development. Collectivisation resulted in a large-scale purge of peasants and so-called Kulaks. In contrast to other Soviet peasants, the Kulaks were supposedly wealthy, and as a result, the state classified them as capitalists, and by extension, it also classified them as enemies of socialism. The term would also become associated with anyone who opposed or even seemed disssatisfied with the Soviet government.

By late 1929, Stalin launched a program which was known as &quot;dekulakization&quot;. Stalin demanded the complete elimination of the kulak class, resulting in the imprisonment and execution of Soviet peasants. In just four months, 60,000 people were sent to the camps and 154,000 other people were exiled. However, this was only the beginning of the &quot;dekulakisation&quot; process. In 1931 alone, 1,803,392 people were exiled.

Although these massive relocation processes were successful in transferring a large potential free forced labor work force to places where it was needed, that is about all it was successful in doing. All of the &quot;special settlers&quot;, as the Soviet government referred to them, lived on starvation level rations, and as a result, many people starved to death in the camps, and anyone who was healthy enough to escape tried to do just that. This situation forced the government to give rations to a group of people which it was hardly getting any use out of, and as a result, it was just costing the Soviet government money. The Unified State Political Administration (OGPU) quickly discovered the problem, and in response, it began to reform the &quot;dekulakisation&quot; process.

In an attempt to prevent mass escapes from the colony, the OGPU started to recruit prisoners who lived inside it, and it also set up ambushes around popular escape routes. The OGPU also attempted to raise the living conditions in these camps in order to discourage people from actively trying to escape from them, and Kulaks were told that they would regain their rights in five years. Even these revisions ultimately failed to resolve the problem, and as a result, the &quot;dekulakisation&quot; process was a failure because it did not lead to the creation of a steady forced labor force for the government. These prisoners were also lucky to be in the gulag in the early 1930s. Prisoners were relatively well off compared to what the prisoners would have to go through in the final years of the gulag.
The Gulag was officially established on April 25, 1930, as the GULAG by the OGPU order 130/63 in accordance with the Sovnarkom order 22 p. 248 dated April 7, 1930. It was renamed as the GULAG in November of that year.

The hypothesis that economic considerations were responsible for mass arrests during the period of Stalinism has been refuted on the grounds of former Soviet archives that have become accessible since the 1990s, although some archival sources also tend to support an economic hypothesis. In any case, the development of the camp system followed economic lines. The growth of the camp system coincided with the peak of the Soviet industrialisation campaign. Most of the camps established to accommodate the masses of incoming prisoners were assigned distinct economic tasks. These included the exploitation of natural resources and the colonization of remote areas, as well as the realisation of enormous infrastructural facilities and industrial construction projects. The plan to achieve these goals with &quot;special settlements&quot; instead of labor camps was dropped after the revealing of the Nazino affair in 1933.

The 1931–32 archives indicate the Gulag had approximately 200,000 prisoners in the camps; while in 1935, approximately 800,000 were in camps and 300,000 in colonies. Gulag population reached a peak value (1.5 million) in 1941, gradually decreased during the war and then started to grow again, achieving a maximum by 1953. Besides Gulag camps, a significant amount of prisoners, which confined prisoners serving short sentence terms.
In the early 1930s, a tightening of the Soviet penal policy caused a significant growth of the prison camp population.

During the Great Purge of 1937–38, mass arrests caused another increase in inmate numbers. Hundreds of thousands of persons were arrested and sentenced to long prison terms on the grounds of one of the multiple passages of the notorious Article 58 of the Criminal Codes of the Union republics, which defined punishment for various forms of &quot;counterrevolutionary activities&quot;. Under NKVD Order No. 00447, tens of thousands of Gulag inmates were executed in 1937–38 for &quot;continuing counterrevolutionary activities&quot;.
Between 1934 and 1941, the number of prisoners with higher education increased more than eight times, and the number of prisoners with high education increased five times. It resulted in their increased share in the overall composition of the camp prisoners. Among the camp prisoners, the number and share of the intelligentsia was growing at the quickest pace. Distrust, hostility, and even hatred for the intelligentsia was a common characteristic of the Soviet leaders. Information regarding the imprisonment trends and consequences for the intelligentsia derive from the extrapolations of Viktor Zemskov from a collection of prison camp population movements data.

=== During World War II ===
==== Political role ====
On the eve of World War II, Soviet archives indicate a combined camp and colony population upwards of 1.6 million in 1939, according to V. P. Kozlov. Anne Applebaum and Steven Rosefielde estimate that 1.2 to 1.5 million people were in Gulag system&#x27;s prison camps and colonies when the war started.

After the German invasion of Poland that marked the start of World War II in Europe, the Soviet Union invaded and annexed eastern parts of the Second Polish Republic. In 1940, the Soviet Union occupied Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bessarabia (now the Republic of Moldova) and Bukovina. According to some estimates, hundreds of thousands of Polish citizens and inhabitants of the other annexed lands, regardless of their ethnic origin, were arrested and sent to the Gulag camps. However, according to the official data, the total number of sentences for political and anti-state (espionage, terrorism) crimes in the USSR in 1939–41 was 211,106.

Approximately 300,000 Polish prisoners of war were captured by the USSR during and after the &quot;Polish Defensive War&quot;. Almost all of the captured officers and a large number of ordinary soldiers were then murdered (see Katyn massacre) or sent to Gulag. Of the 10,000–12,000 Poles sent to Kolyma in 1940–41, most prisoners of war, only 583 men survived, released in 1942 to join the Polish Armed Forces in the East. Out of General Anders&#x27; 80,000 evacuees from Soviet Union gathered in Great Britain only 310 volunteered to return to Soviet-controlled Poland in 1947.

During the Great Patriotic War, Gulag populations declined sharply due to a steep rise in mortality in 1942–43. In the winter of 1941, a quarter of the Gulag&#x27;s population died of starvation. 516,841 prisoners died in prison camps in 1941–43, from a combination of their harsh working conditions and the famine caused by the German invasion. This period accounts for about half of all gulag deaths, according to Russian statistics.

In 1943, the term &quot;katorga works&quot; () was reintroduced. They were initially intended for Nazi collaborators, but then other categories of political prisoners (for example, members of deported peoples who fled from exile) were also sentenced to &quot;katorga works&quot;. Prisoners sentenced to &quot;katorga works&quot; were sent to Gulag prison camps with the most harsh regime and many of them perished.

==== Economic role ====
Up until World War II, the Gulag system expanded dramatically to create a Soviet &quot;camp economy&quot;. Right before the war, forced labor provided 46.5% of the nation&#x27;s nickel, 76% of its tin, 40% of its cobalt, 40.5% of its chrome-iron ore, 60% of its gold, and 25.3% of its timber. And in preparation for war, the NKVD put up many more factories and built highways and railroads.

The Gulag quickly switched to the production of arms and supplies for the army after fighting began. At first, transportation remained a priority. In 1940, the NKVD focused most of its energy on railroad construction. This would prove extremely important when the German advance into the Soviet Union started in 1941. In addition, factories converted to produce ammunition, uniforms, and other supplies. Moreover, the NKVD gathered skilled workers and specialists from throughout the Gulag into 380 special colonies which produced tanks, aircraft, armaments, and ammunition.

Despite its low capital costs, the camp economy suffered from serious flaws. For one, actual productivity almost never matched estimates: the estimates proved far too optimistic. In addition, scarcity of machinery and tools plagued the camps and the tools that the camps did have quickly broke. The Eastern Siberian Trust of the Chief Administration of Camps for Highway Construction destroyed ninety-four trucks in just three years. But the greatest problem was simple – forced labor was less efficient than free labor. In fact, prisoners in the Gulag were, on average, half as productive as free laborers in the USSR at the time, which may be partially explained by malnutrition.

To make up for this disparity, the NKVD worked prisoners harder than ever. To meet rising demand, prisoners worked longer and longer hours, and on lower food-rations than ever before. A camp administrator said in a meeting: &quot;There are cases when a prisoner is given only four or five hours out of twenty-four for rest, which significantly lowers his productivity.&quot; In the words of a former Gulag prisoner: &quot;By the spring of 1942, the camp ceased to function. It was difficult to find people who were even able to gather firewood or bury the dead.&quot;

The scarcity of food stemmed in part from the general strain on the entire Soviet Union, but also the lack of central aid to the Gulag during the war. The central government focused all its attention on the military and left the camps to their own devices. In 1942, the Gulag set up the Supply Administration to find their own food and industrial goods. During this time, not only did food become scarce, but the NKVD limited rations in an attempt to motivate the prisoners to work harder for more food, a policy that lasted until 1948.

In addition to food shortages, the Gulag suffered from labor scarcity at the beginning of the war. The Great Terror of 1936–1938 had provided a large supply of free labor, but by the start of World War II the purges had slowed down. In order to complete all of their projects, camp administrators moved prisoners from project to project. To improve the situation, laws were implemented in mid-1940 that allowed giving short camp sentences (4 months or a year) to those convicted of petty theft, hooliganism, or labor-discipline infractions. By January 1941, the Gulag workforce had increased by approximately 300,000 prisoners. But in 1942, serious food shortages began, and camp populations dropped again. The camps lost still more prisoners to the war effort as the Soviet Union went into a total war footing in June 1941. Many laborers received early releases so that they could be drafted and sent to the front.

Even as the pool of workers shrank, demand for outputs continued to grow rapidly. As a result, the Soviet government pushed the Gulag to &quot;do more with less&quot;. With fewer able-bodied workers and few supplies from outside the camp system, camp administrators had to find a way to maintain production. The solution they found was to push the remaining prisoners still harder. The NKVD employed a system of setting unrealistically high production goals, straining resources in an attempt to encourage higher productivity. As the Axis armies pushed into Soviet territory from June 1941 on, labor resources became further strained, and many of the camps had to evacuate out of Western Russia.

From the beginning of the war to halfway through 1944, 40 camps were set up, and 69 were disbanded. During evacuations, machinery received priority, leaving prisoners to reach safety on foot. The speed of Operation Barbarossa&#x27;s advance prevented the evacuation of all prisoners in good time, and the NKVD massacred many to prevent them from falling into German hands. While this practice denied the Germans a source of free labor, it also further restricted the Gulag&#x27;s capacity to keep up with the Red Army&#x27;s demands. When the tide of the war turned, however, and the Soviets started pushing the Axis invaders back, fresh batches of laborers replenished the camps. As the Red Army recaptured territories from the Germans, an influx of Soviet ex-POWs greatly increased the Gulag population.

=== After World War II ===
After World War II, the number of inmates in prison camps and colonies sharply rose again, reaching approximately 2.5 million people by the early 1950s (about 1.7 million of whom were in camps).

When the war in Europe ended in May 1945, as many as two million former Russian citizens were forcefully repatriated into the USSR. On February 11, 1945, at the conclusion of the Yalta Conference, the United States and United Kingdom signed a Repatriation Agreement with the Soviet Union. One interpretation of this agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets. British and United States civilian authorities ordered their military forces in Europe to deport to the Soviet Union up to two million former residents of the Soviet Union, including persons who had left the Russian Empire and established different citizenship years before. The forced repatriation operations took place from 1945 to 1947.

Multiple sources state that Soviet POWs, on their return to the Soviet Union, were treated as traitors (see Order No. 270). According to some sources, over 1.5 million surviving Red Army soldiers imprisoned by the Germans were sent to the Gulag. However, that is a confusion with two other types of camps. During and after World War II, freed POWs went to special &quot;filtration&quot; camps. Of these, by 1944, more than 90 percent were cleared, and about 8 percent were arrested or condemned to penal battalions. In 1944, they were sent directly to reserve military formations to be cleared by the NKVD.

Furthermore, in 1945, about 100 filtration camps were set for repatriated &quot;Ostarbeiter&quot;, POWs, and other displaced persons, which processed more than 4,000,000 people. By 1946, the major part of the population of these camps were cleared by NKVD and either sent home or conscripted (see table for details). 226,127 out of 1,539,475 POWs were transferred to the NKVD, i.e. the Gulag.
After Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat, ten NKVD-run &quot;special camps&quot; subordinate to the Gulag were set up in the Soviet Occupation Zone of post-war Germany. These &quot;special camps&quot; were former Stalags, prisons, or Nazi concentration camps such as Sachsenhausen (special camp number 7) and Buchenwald (special camp number 2). According to German government estimates &quot;65,000 people died in those Soviet-run camps or in transportation to them.&quot; According to German researchers, Sachsenhausen, where 12,500 Soviet era victims have been uncovered, should be seen as an integral part of the Gulag system.
Yet the major reason for the post-war increase in the number of prisoners was the tightening of legislation on property offences in summer 1947 (at this time there was a famine in some parts of the Soviet Union, claiming about 1 million lives), which resulted in hundreds of thousands of convictions to lengthy prison terms, sometimes on the basis of cases of petty theft or embezzlement. At the beginning of 1953, the total number of prisoners in prison camps was more than 2.4 million of which more than 465,000 were political prisoners.

In 1948, the system of &quot;special camps&quot; was established exclusively for a &quot;special contingent&quot; of political prisoners, convicted according to the more severe sub-articles of Article 58 (Enemies of people): treason, espionage, terrorism, etc., for various real political opponents, such as Trotskyites, &quot;nationalists&quot; (Ukrainian nationalism), white émigré, as well as for fabricated ones.

The state continued to maintain the extensive camp system for a while after Stalin&#x27;s death in March 1953, although the period saw the grip of the camp authorities weaken, and a number of conflicts and uprisings occur (&quot;see&quot; Bitch Wars; Kengir uprising; Vorkuta uprising).

The amnesty of 1953 was limited to non-political prisoners and for political prisoners sentenced to not more than , therefore mostly those convicted for common crimes were then freed. The release of political prisoners started in 1954 and became widespread, and also coupled with mass rehabilitations, after Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s denunciation of Stalinism in his Secret Speech at the 20th Congress of the CPSU in February 1956.

The &quot;Gulag&quot; institution was closed by the MVD order No 020 of January 25, 1960, but forced labor colonies for political and criminal prisoners continued to exist. Political prisoners continued to be kept in one of the most famous camps Perm-36 until 1987 when it was closed.

The Russian penal system, despite reforms and a reduction in prison population, informally or formally continues many practices endemic to the &quot;Gulag&quot; system, including forced labor, inmates policing inmates, and prisoner intimidation.

In the late 2000s, some human rights activists accused authorities of gradual removal of Gulag remembrance from places such as Perm-36 and Solovki prison camp.

According to Encyclopædia Britannica,
== Death toll ==

Prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, estimates of Gulag victims ranged from 2.3 to 17.6 million (see History of Gulag population estimates). Mortality in Gulag camps in 1934–40 was 4–6 times higher than average in the Soviet Union. Post-1991 research by historians accessing archival materials brought this range down considerably. In a 1993 study of archival Soviet data, a total of 1,053,829 people died in the Gulag from 1934 to 1953.

It was common practice to release prisoners who were either suffering from incurable diseases or near death, so a combined statistics on mortality &quot;in the camps&quot; and mortality &quot;caused by the camps&quot; was higher. The tentative historical consensus is that, of the 18 million people who passed through the gulag from 1930 to 1953, between 1.6 million and 1.76 million perished as a result of their detention, and about half of all deaths occurred between 1941 and 1943 following the German invasion. Timothy Snyder writes that &quot;with the exception of the war years, a very large majority of people who entered the Gulag left alive&quot;. If prisoner deaths from labor colonies and special settlements are included, the death toll rises to 2,749,163, according to J. Otto Pohl&#x27;s incomplete data.

In her 2018 study, Golfo Alexopoulos attempted to challenge this consensus figure by encompassing those whose life was shortened due to GULAG conditions. Alexopoulos concluded from her research that a systematic practice of the Gulag was to release sick prisoners on the verge of death; and that all prisoners who received the health classification &quot;invalid&quot;, &quot;light physical labor&quot;, &quot;light individualised labor&quot;, or &quot;physically defective&quot; that together according to Alexopoulos encompassed at least one third of all inmates who passed through the Gulag died or had their lives shortened due to detention in the Gulag in captivity or shortly after release.

The GULAG mortality estimated in this way yields the figure of 6 million deaths. Historian Orlando Figes and Russian writer Vadim Erlikman have posited similar estimates. The estimate of Alexopoulos, however, has obvious methodological difficulties and is supported by misinterpreted evidence, such as presuming that hundreds of thousands of prisoners &quot;directed to other places of detention&quot; in 1948 was a euphemism for releasing prisoners on the verge of death into labor colonies, when it was really referring to internal transport in the Gulag rather than release.

In a University of Oxford doctoral dissertation, in 2020, the problem of medical release (″&quot;aktirovka&quot;″) and of mortality among &#x27;certified invalids&#x27; (″&quot;aktirovannye&quot;″) was considered in detail by Mikhail Nakonechnyi. He concluded that the number of terminally ill people discharged early on medical grounds from the Gulag was about 1 million. Mikhail added 800,000–850,000 excess deaths to the death toll directly caused by the results of GULAG incarceration, which brings the death toll to 2.5 million people.

=== Mortality rate ===
In 2009, Steven Rosefielde stated more complete archival data increases camp deaths by 19.4 percent to 1,258,537, &quot;the best archivally-based estimate of Gulag excess deaths at present is 1.6 million from 1929 to 1953.&quot; Dan Healey in 2018 also stated the same thing &quot;New studies using declassified Gulag archives have provisionally established a consensus on mortality and &quot;inhumanity.&quot; The tentative consensus says that once secret records of the Gulag administration in Moscow show a lower death toll than expected from memoir sources, generally between 1.5 and 1.7 million (out of 18 million who passed through) for the years from 1930 to 1953.&quot;

Certificates of death in the Gulag system for the period from 1930 to 1956 

== Gulag administrators ==
== Conditions ==
Living and working conditions in the camps varied significantly across time and place, depending, among other things, on the impact of broader events (World War II, countrywide famines and shortages, waves of terror, sudden influx or release of large numbers of prisoners) and the type of crime committed. Instead of being used for economic gain, political prisoners were typically given the worst work or were dumped into the less productive parts of the gulag. For example Victor Herman, in his memoirs, compares the and the 2 camps, which were both near Vyatka.

In Burepolom there were roughly 3,000 prisoners, all non-political, in the central compound. They could walk around at will, were lightly guarded, had unlocked barracks with mattresses and pillows, and watched western movies. However Nuksha 2, which housed serious criminals and political prisoners, featured guard towers with machine guns and locked barracks. In some camps prisoners were only permitted to send one letter a year and were not allowed to have photos of loved ones.

Some prisoners were released early if they displayed good performance. There were several productive activities for prisoners in the camps. For example, in early 1935, a course in livestock raising was held for prisoners at a state farm; those who took it had their workday reduced to four hours. During that year the professional theater group in the camp complex gave 230 performances of plays and concerts to over 115,000 spectators. Camp newspapers also existed.

Andrei Vyshinsky, chief procurator of the Soviet Union, wrote a memorandum to NKVD chief Nikolai Yezhov in 1938, during the Great Purge, which stated:

Among the prisoners there are some so ragged and lice-ridden that they pose a sanitary danger to the rest. These prisoners have deteriorated to the point of losing any resemblance to human beings. Lacking food…they collect orts [refuse] and, according to some prisoners, eat rats and dogs.

According to prisoner Yevgenia Ginzburg, Gulag inmates could tell when Yezhov was no longer in charge as one day the conditions relaxed. A few days later Beria&#x27;s name appeared in official prison notices.

In general, the central administrative bodies showed a discernible interest in maintaining the labor force of prisoners in a condition allowing the fulfilment of construction and production plans handed down from above. Besides a wide array of punishments for prisoners refusing to work (which, in practice, were sometimes applied to prisoners that were too enfeebled to meet production quota), they instituted a number of positive incentives intended to boost productivity. These included monetary bonuses (since the early 1930s) and wage payments (from 1950 onward), cuts of individual sentences, general early-release schemes for norm fulfilment and overfulfilment (until 1939, again in selected camps from 1946 onward), preferential treatment, sentence reduction and privileges for the most productive workers (shock workers or Stakhanovites in Soviet parlance).

Inmates were used as camp guards and could purchase camp newspapers as well as bonds. Robert W. Thurston writes that this was &quot;at least an indication that they were still regarded as participants in society to some degree.&quot; Sports team, particularly football teams, were set up by the prison authorities.

Boris Sulim, a former prisoner who had worked in the Omsuchkan camp, close to Magadan, when he was a teenager stated:

I was 18 years old and Magadan seemed a very romantic place to me. I got 880 rubles a month and a 3000 ruble installation grant, which was a hell of a lot of money for a kid like me. I was able to give my mother some of it. They even gave me membership in the Komsomol. There was a mining and ore-processing plant which sent out parties to dig for tin. I worked at the radio station which kept contact with the parties. [...] If the inmates were good and disciplined they had almost the same rights as the free workers. They were trusted and they even went to the movies. As for the reason they were in the camps, well, I never poked my nose into details. We all thought the people were there because they were guilty.

Immediately after the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941 the conditions in camps worsened drastically: quotas were increased, rations cut, and medical supplies came close to none, all of which led to a sharp increase in mortality. The situation slowly improved in the final period and after the end of the war.

Considering the overall conditions and their influence on inmates, it is important to distinguish three major strata of Gulag inmates:

*&quot;Kulaks&quot;, &quot;osadniks&quot;, &quot;ukazniks&quot; (people sentenced for violation of various ukases, e.g. Law of Spikelets, decree about work discipline, etc.), occasional violators of criminal law
*Dedicated criminals: &quot;thieves in law&quot;
*People sentenced for various political and religious reasons.

=== Gulag and famine (1932–1933) ===
The Soviet famine of 1932–1933 swept across many different regions of the Soviet Union. During this time, it is estimated that around six to seven million people starved to death. On 7 August 1932, a new decree drafted by Stalin (Law of Spikelets) specified a minimum sentence of ten years or execution for theft from collective farms or of cooperative property. Over the next few months, prosecutions rose fourfold. A large share of cases prosecuted under the law were for the theft of small quantities of grain worth less than fifty rubles. The law was later relaxed on 8 May 1933. Overall, during the first half of 1933, prisons saw more new incoming inmates than the three previous years combined.

Prisoners in the camps faced harsh working conditions. One Soviet report stated that, in early 1933, up to 15% of the prison population in Soviet Uzbekistan died monthly. During this time, prisoners were getting around worth of food a day. Many inmates attempted to flee, causing an upsurge in coercive and violent measures. Camps were directed &quot;not to spare bullets&quot;.

=== Social conditions ===
The convicts in such camps were actively involved in all kinds of labor with one of them being logging. The working territory of logging presented by itself a square and was surrounded by forest clearing. Thus, all attempts to exit or escape from it were well observed from the four towers set at each of its corners.

Locals who captured a runaway were given rewards. It is also said that camps in colder areas were less concerned with finding escaped prisoners as they would die anyhow from the severely cold winters. In such cases prisoners who did escape without getting shot were often found dead kilometres away from the camp.

== Geography ==

In the early days of Gulag, the locations for the camps were chosen primarily for the isolated conditions involved. Remote monasteries in particular were frequently reused as sites for new camps. The site on the Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea is one of the earliest and also most noteworthy, taking root soon after the Revolution in 1918. The colloquial name for the islands, &quot;Solovki&quot;, entered the vernacular as a synonym for the labor camp in general. It was presented to the world as an example of the new Soviet method for &quot;re-education of class enemies&quot; and reintegrating them through labor into Soviet society. Initially the inmates, largely Russian intelligentsia, enjoyed relative freedom within the natural confinement of the islands.

Local newspapers and magazines were published. Even some scientific research was carried out, e.g., a local botanical garden was maintained but unfortunately later lost completely. Eventually, Solovki turned into an ordinary Gulag camp. Some historians maintain that it was a pilot camp of this type. In 1929, Maxim Gorky visited the camp and published an apology for it. The report of Gorky&#x27;s trip to Solovki was included in the cycle of impressions titled &quot;Po Soiuzu Sovetov&quot;, Part V, subtitled &quot;Solovki.&quot; In the report, Gorky wrote that &quot;camps such as &#x27;Solovki&#x27; were absolutely necessary.&quot;

With the new emphasis on Gulag as the means of concentrating cheap labor, new camps were then constructed throughout the Soviet sphere of influence, wherever the economic task at hand dictated their existence, or was designed specifically to avail itself of them, such as the White Sea–Baltic Canal or the Baikal–Amur Mainline, including facilities in big cities — parts of the famous Moscow Metro and the Moscow State University new campus were built by forced labor. Many more projects during the rapid industrialisation of the 1930s, war-time and post-war periods were fulfilled on the backs of convicts. The activity of Gulag camps spanned a wide cross-section of Soviet industry. Gorky organized in 1933 a trip of 120 writers and artists to the White Sea–Baltic Canal, 36 of them wrote a propaganda book about the construction published in 1934 and destroyed in 1937.

The majority of Gulag camps were positioned in extremely remote areas of northeastern Siberia (the best known clusters are &quot;Sevvostlag&quot; (&quot;The North-East Camps&quot;) along Kolyma river and &quot;Norillag&quot; near Norilsk) and in the southeastern parts of the Soviet Union, mainly in the steppes of Kazakhstan (&quot;Luglag&quot;, &quot;Steplag&quot;, &quot;Peschanlag&quot;). A detailed map was made by the Memorial Foundation.

These were vast and sparsely inhabited regions with no roads or sources of food, but rich in minerals and other natural resources, such as timber. The construction of the roads was assigned to the inmates of specialised railway camps. Camps were generally spread throughout the entire Soviet Union, including the European parts of Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. 

There were several camps outside the Soviet Union, in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Mongolia, which were under the direct control of the Gulag.

Throughout the history of the Soviet Union, there were at least 476 separate camp administrations. The Russian researcher Galina Ivanova stated that,

to date, Russian historians have discovered and described 476 camps that existed at different times on the territory of the USSR. It is well known that practically every one of them had several branches, many of which were quite large. In addition to the large numbers of camps, there were no less than 2,000 colonies. It would be virtually impossible to reflect the entire mass of Gulag facilities on a map that would also account for the various times of their existence.

Since many of these existed only for short periods, the number of camp administrations at any given point was lower. It peaked in the early 1950s when there were more than 100 camp administrations across the Soviet Union. Most camp administrations oversaw several single camp units, some as many as dozens or even hundreds. The infamous complexes were those at Kolyma, Norilsk, and Vorkuta, all in arctic or subarctic regions. However, prisoner mortality in Norilsk in most periods was actually lower than across the camp system as a whole.

==Personnel==
Command Category 1 (head of the Gulag) was a Commissar of State Security of the 2nd class; Command Category 2 (deputy head of the Gulag) was a Commissar of State Security of the 3rd class. They wore the uniform and insignia of the NKVD. When the GULAG was transferred to the NKGB in 1943, the GULAG personnel began to use NKGB ranks and distinctions.
*7 - Military personnel of the guard units wore a silver triangle on the collar.
*9 - Technical-administrative and political personnel of the guard units wore a red triangle on the collar.
* 10 - Technical personnel wore crossed hammers and wrenches on the collar.

== Special institutions ==
* There were separate camps or zones within camps for juveniles (, ), the disabled (in Spassk), and mothers (, ) with babies.
* Family members of &quot;Traitors of the Motherland&quot; (, ) were placed under a special category of repression.
* Secret research laboratories known as &quot;Sharashka&quot; () held arrested and convicted scientists, some of them prominent, where they anonymously developed new technologies and also conducted basic research.

== Historiography ==

=== Origins and functions of the Gulag ===
According to historian Stephen Barnes, the origins and functions of the Gulag can be looked at in four major ways:

* The first approach was championed by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and is what Barnes terms the moral explanation. According to this view, Soviet ideology eliminated the moral checks on the darker side of human nature – providing convenient justifications for violence and evil-doing on all levels: from political decision-making to personal relations. 
* Another approach is the political explanation, according to which the Gulag (along with executions) was primarily a means for eliminating the regime&#x27;s perceived political enemies (this understanding is favoured by historian Robert Conquest, amongst others). 
* The economic explanation, in turn as set out by historian Anne Applebaum, argues that the Soviet regime instrumentalised the Gulag for its economic development projects. Although never economically profitable, it was perceived as such right up to Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953.
* Finally, Barnes advances his own, fourth explanation, which situates the Gulag in the context of modern projects of &#x27;cleansing&#x27; the social body of hostile elements, through spatial isolation and physical elimination of individuals defined as harmful.

Hannah Arendt argues that as part of a totalitarian system of government, the camps of the Gulag system were experiments in &quot;total domination.&quot; In her view, the goal of a totalitarian system was not merely to establish limits on liberty, but rather to abolish liberty entirely in service of its ideology. She argues that the Gulag system was not merely political repression because the system survived and grew long after Stalin had wiped out all serious political resistance. Although the various camps were initially filled with criminals and political prisoners, eventually they were filled with prisoners who were arrested irrespective of anything relating to them as individuals, but rather only on the basis of their membership in some ever shifting category of imagined threats to the state.

She also argues that the function of the Gulag system was not truly economic. Although the Soviet government deemed them all &quot;forced labor&quot; camps, this in fact highlighted that the work in the camps was deliberately pointless, since all Russian workers could be subject to forced labor. The only real economic purpose they typically served was financing the cost of their own supervision. Otherwise the work performed was generally useless, either by design or made that way through extremely poor planning and execution; some workers even preferred more difficult work if it was actually productive. She differentiated between &quot;authentic&quot; forced-labor camps, concentration camps, and &quot;annihilation camps&quot;.

In authentic labor camps, inmates worked in &quot;relative freedom and are sentenced for limited periods.&quot; Concentration camps had extremely high mortality rates and but were still &quot;essentially organized for labor purposes.&quot; Annihilation camps were those where the inmates were &quot;systematically wiped out through starvation and neglect.&quot; She criticizes other commentators&#x27; conclusion that the purpose of the camps was a supply of cheap labor. According to her, the Soviets were able to liquidate the camp system without serious economic consequences, showing that the camps were not an important source of labor and were overall economically irrelevant.

Arendt argues that together with the systematized, arbitrary cruelty inside the camps, this served the purpose of total domination by eliminating the idea that the arrestees had any political or legal rights. Morality was destroyed by maximizing cruelty and by organizing the camps internally to make the inmates and guards complicit. The terror resulting from the operation of the Gulag system caused people outside of the camps to cut all ties with anyone who was arrested or purged and to avoid forming ties with others for fear of being associated with anyone who was targeted. As a result, the camps were essential as the nucleus of a system that destroyed individuality and dissolved all social bonds. Thereby, the system attempted to eliminate any capacity for resistance or self-directed action in the greater population.

=== Archival documents ===
Statistical reports made by the OGPU–NKVD–MGB–MVD between the 1930s and 1950s are kept in the State Archive of the Russian Federation formerly called Central State Archive of the October Revolution (CSAOR). These documents were highly classified and inaccessible. Amid glasnost and democratization in the late 1980s, Viktor Zemskov and other Russian researchers managed to gain access to the documents and published the highly classified statistical data collected by the OGPU-NKVD-MGB-MVD and related to the number of the Gulag prisoners, special settlers, etc. In 1995, Zemskov wrote that foreign scientists have begun to be admitted to the restricted-access collection of these documents in the State Archive of the Russian Federation since 1992. However, only one historian, namely Zemskov, was admitted to these archives, and later the archives were again &quot;closed&quot;, according to Leonid Lopatnikov. Pressure from the Putin administration has exacerbated the difficulties of Gulag researchers.

While considering the issue of reliability of the primary data provided by corrective labor institutions, it is necessary to take into account the following two circumstances. On the one hand, their administration was not interested to understate the number of prisoners in its reports, because it would have automatically led to a decrease in the food supply plan for camps, prisons, and corrective labor colonies. The decrement in food would have been accompanied by an increase in mortality that would have led to wrecking of the vast production program of the Gulag. On the other hand, overstatement of data of the number of prisoners also did not comply with departmental interests, because it was fraught with the same (i.e., impossible) increase in production tasks set by planning bodies. In those days, people were highly responsible for non-fulfilment of plan. It seems that a resultant of these objective departmental interests was a sufficient degree of reliability of the reports.

Between 1990 and 1992, the first precise statistical data on the Gulag based on the Gulag archives were published by Viktor Zemskov. These had been generally accepted by leading Western scholars, despite the fact that a number of inconsistencies were found in this statistics. Not all the conclusions drawn by Zemskov based on his data have been generally accepted. Thus, Sergei Maksudov alleged that although literary sources, for example the books of Lev Razgon or Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, did not envisage the total number of the camps very well and markedly exaggerated their size. On the other hand, Viktor Zemskov, who published many documents by the NKVD and KGB, was far from understanding of the Gulag essence and the nature of socio-political processes in the country. He added that without distinguishing the degree of accuracy and reliability of certain figures, without making a critical analysis of sources, without comparing new data with already known information, Zemskov absolutizes the published materials by presenting them as the ultimate truth. As a result, Maksudov charges that Zemskov&#x27;s attempts to make generalized statements with reference to a particular document, as a rule, do not hold water.
In response, Zemskov wrote that the charge that he allegedly did not compare new data with already known information could not be called fair. In his words, the trouble with most western writers is that they do not benefit from such comparisons. Zemskov added that when he tried not to overuse the juxtaposition of new information with &quot;old&quot; one, it was only because of a sense of delicacy, not to once again psychologically traumatize the researchers whose works used incorrect figures, as it turned out after the publication of the statistics by the OGPU-NKVD-MGB-MVD.

According to French historian Nicolas Werth, the mountains of the materials of the Gulag archives, which are stored in funds of the State Archive of the Russian Federation and were being constantly exposed during the last fifteen years, represent only a very small part of bureaucratic prose of immense size left over after the decades of &quot;creativity&quot; by the &quot;dull and reptile&quot; organization managing the Gulag. In many cases, local camp archives, which had been stored in sheds, barracks, or other rapidly disintegrating buildings, simply disappeared in the same way as most of the camp buildings did.

In 2004 and 2005, some archival documents were published in the edition &quot;Istoriya Stalinskogo Gulaga. Konets 1920-kh — Pervaya Polovina 1950-kh Godov. Sobranie Dokumentov v 7 Tomakh&quot; (&quot;The History of Stalin&#x27;s Gulag. From the Late 1920s to the First Half of the 1950s. Collection of Documents in Seven Volumes&quot;), wherein each of its seven volumes covered a particular issue indicated in the title of the volume:

# &quot;Mass Repression in the USSR&quot; (&quot;Massovye Repressii v SSSR&quot;); 
# &quot;Punitive System. Structure and Cadres&quot; (&quot;Karatelnaya Sistema. Struktura i Kadry&quot;);
# &quot;Economy of the Gulag&quot; (&quot;Ekonomika Gulaga&quot;);
# &quot;The Population of the Gulag. The Number and Conditions of Confinement&quot; (&quot;Naselenie Gulaga. Chislennost i Usloviya Soderzhaniya&quot;);
# &quot;Specsettlers in the USSR&quot; (&quot;Specpereselentsy v SSSR&quot;);
# &quot;Uprisings, Riots, and Strikes of Prisoners&quot; (&quot;Vosstaniya, Bunty i Zabastovki Zaklyuchyonnykh&quot;); and
# &quot;Soviet Repressive and Punitive Policy. Annotated Index of Cases of the SA RF&quot; (&quot;Sovetskaya Pepressivno-karatelnaya Politika i Penitentsiarnaya Sistema. Annotirovanniy Ukazatel Del GA RF&quot;).

The edition contains the brief introductions by the two &quot;patriarchs of the Gulag science&quot;, Robert Conquest and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and 1,431 documents, the overwhelming majority of which were obtained from funds of the State Archive of the Russian Federation.

=== History of Gulag population estimates ===
During the decades before the dissolution of the USSR, the debates about the population size of GULAG failed to arrive at generally accepted figures; wide-ranging estimates have been offered, and the bias toward higher or lower side was sometimes ascribed to political views of the particular author. Some of those earlier estimates (both high and low) are shown in the table below.
The glasnost political reforms in the late 1980s and the subsequent dissolution of the USSR, led to the release of a large amount of formerly classified archival documents including new demographic and NKVD data. Analysis of the official GULAG statistics by Western scholars immediately demonstrated that, despite their inconsistency, they do not support previously published higher estimates. Importantly, the released documents made possible to clarify terminology used to describe different categories of forced labor population, because the use of the terms &quot;forced labor&quot;, &quot;GULAG&quot;, &quot;camps&quot; interchangeably by early researchers led to significant confusion and resulted in significant inconsistencies in the earlier estimates.

Archival studies revealed several components of the NKVD penal system in the Stalinist USSR: prisons, labor camps, labor colonies, as well as various &quot;settlements&quot; (exile) and of non-custodial forced labor. Although most of them fit the definition of forced labor, only labor camps, and labor colonies were associated with punitive forced labor in detention. Forced labor camps (&quot;GULAG camps&quot;) were hard regime camps, whose inmates were serving more than three-year terms. As a rule, they were situated in remote parts of the USSR, and labor conditions were extremely hard there. They formed a core of the GULAG system. The inmates of &quot;corrective labor colonies&quot; served shorter terms; these colonies were located in less remote parts of the USSR, and they were run by local NKVD administration.

Preliminary analysis of the GULAG camps and colonies statistics (see the chart on the right) demonstrated that the population reached the maximum before the World War II, then dropped sharply, partially due to massive releases, partially due to wartime high mortality, and then was gradually increasing until the end of Stalin era, reaching the global maximum in 1953, when the combined population of GULAG camps and labor colonies amounted to 2,625,000.

The results of these archival studies convinced many scholars, including Robert Conquest or Stephen Wheatcroft to reconsider their earlier estimates of the size of the GULAG population, although the &#x27;high numbers&#x27; of arrested and deaths are not radically different from earlier estimates. Although such scholars as Rosefielde or Vishnevsky point at several inconsistencies in archival data with Rosefielde pointing out the archival figure of 1,196,369 for the population of the Gulag and labor colonies combined on December 31, 1936, is less than half the 2.75 million labor camp population given to the Census Board by the NKVD for the 1937 census, it is generally believed that these data provide more reliable and detailed information that the indirect data and literary sources available for the scholars during the Cold War era. Although Conquest cited Beria&#x27;s report to the Politburo of the labor camp numbers at the end of 1938 stating there were almost 7 million prisoners in the labor camps, more than three times the archival figure for 1938 and an official report to Stalin by the Soviet minister of State Security in 1952 stating there were 12 million prisoners in the labor camps.

These data allowed scholars to conclude that during the period of 1928–53, about 14 million prisoners passed through the system of GULAG &quot;labor camps&quot; and 4–5 million passed through the &quot;labor colonies&quot;. Thus, these figures reflect the number of convicted persons, and do not take into account the fact that a significant part of Gulag inmates had been convicted more than one time, so the actual number of convicted is somewhat overstated by these statistics. From other hand, during some periods of Gulag history the official figures of GULAG population reflected the camps&#x27; capacity, not the actual number of inmates, so the actual figures were 15% higher in, e.g. 1946.

The USSR implemented a number of labor disciplinary measures, due to the lack of productivity of its labour force in the early 1930s. 1.8 million workers were sentenced to 6 months in forced labor with a quarter of their original pay, 3.3 million faced sanctions, and 60k were imprisoned for absentees in 1940 alone. The conditions of Soviet workers worsened in WW2 as 1.3 million were punished in 1942, and 1 million each were punished in subsequent 1943 and 1944 with the reduction of 25% of food rations. Further more, 460 thousand were imprisoned throughout these years.

== Impact ==
=== Culture ===
The Gulag spanned nearly four decades of Soviet and East European history and affected millions of individuals. Its cultural impact was enormous.

The Gulag has become a major influence on contemporary Russian thinking, and an important part of modern Russian folklore. Many songs by the authors-performers known as the &quot;bards&quot;, most notably Vladimir Vysotsky and Alexander Galich, neither of whom ever served time in the camps, describe life inside the Gulag and glorified the life of &quot;&quot;. Words and phrases which originated in the labor camps became part of the Russian/Soviet vernacular in the 1960s and 1970s.
The memoirs of Alexander Dolgun, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Varlam Shalamov and Yevgenia Ginzburg, among others, became a symbol of defiance in Soviet society. These writings harshly chastised the Soviet people for their tolerance and apathy regarding the Gulag, but at the same time provided a testament to the courage and resolve of those who were imprisoned.

Another cultural phenomenon in the Soviet Union linked with the Gulag was the forced migration of many artists and other people of culture to Siberia. This resulted in a Renaissance of sorts in places like Magadan, where, for example, the quality of theatre production was comparable to Moscow&#x27;s and Eddie Rosner played jazz.

==== Literature ====
Many eyewitness accounts of Gulag prisoners have been published:
* Varlam Shalamov&#x27;s &quot;Kolyma Tales&quot; is a short-story collection, cited by most major works on the Gulag, and widely considered one of the main Soviet accounts.
* Victor Kravchenko wrote &quot;I Chose Freedom&quot; after defecting to the United States in 1944. As a leader of industrial plants he had encountered forced labor camps in across the Soviet Union from 1935 to 1941. He describes a visit to one camp at Kemerovo on the Tom River in Siberia. Factories paid a fixed sum to the KGB for every convict they employed.
* Anatoli Granovsky wrote &quot;I Was an NKVD Agent&quot; after defecting to Sweden in 1946 and included his experiences seeing gulag prisoners as a young boy, as well as his experiences as a prisoner himself in 1939. Granovsky&#x27;s father was sent to the gulag in 1937.
* Julius Margolin&#x27;s book &quot;A Travel to the Land Ze-Ka&quot; was finished in 1947, but it was impossible to publish such a book about the Soviet Union at the time, immediately after World War II.
* Gustaw Herling-Grudziński wrote &quot;A World Apart&quot;, which was translated into English by Andrzej Ciolkosz and published with an introduction by Bertrand Russell in 1951. By describing life in the gulag in a harrowing personal account, it provides an in-depth, original analysis of the nature of the Soviet communist system.
* Victor Herman&#x27;s book &quot;Coming out of the Ice: An Unexpected Life&quot;. Herman experienced firsthand many places, prisons, and experiences that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was able to reference in only passing or through brief second hand accounts.
* Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s book &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; was not the first literary work about labor camps. His previous book on the subject, &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot;, about a typical day in the life of a Gulag inmate, was originally published in the most prestigious Soviet monthly, &quot;Novy Mir&quot; (&quot;New World&quot;), in November 1962, but was soon banned and withdrawn from all libraries. It was the first work to demonstrate the Gulag as an instrument of governmental repression against its own citizens on a massive scale. &quot;The First Circle&quot;, an account of three days in the lives of prisoners in the &quot;Marfino&quot; &quot;sharashka&quot; or special prison was submitted for publication to the Soviet authorities shortly after &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot; but was rejected and later published abroad in 1968.
* Slavomir Rawicz&#x27;s book &quot;The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom&quot;: In 1941, the author and six other fellow prisoners escaped a Soviet labor camp in Yakutsk.
* János Rózsás, a Hungarian writer, often referred to as the Hungarian Solzhenitsyn, wrote many books and articles on the issue of the Gulag.
*Zoltan Szalkai, a Hungarian documentary filmmaker, made several films about gulag camps.
* Karlo Štajner, a Croatian communist who was active in the former Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the manager of the Comintern Publishing House in Moscow 1932–39, was arrested one night and taken from his Moscow home after being accused of anti-revolutionary activities. He spent the next 20 years in camps from Solovki to Norilsk. After USSR–Yugoslavian political normalization he was re-tried and quickly found innocent. He left the Soviet Union with his wife, who had been waiting for him for 20 years, in 1956 and spent the rest of his life in Zagreb, Croatia. He wrote an impressive book titled &quot;7000 days in Siberia&quot;.
* &quot;Dancing Under the Red Star&quot; by Karl Tobien () tells the story of Margaret Werner, an athletic girl who moves to Russia right before Stalin came to power. She faces many hardships, as her father is taken away from her and imprisoned. Werner is the only American woman who was held in the Gulag to tell about it.
* &quot;Alexander Dolgun&#x27;s Story: An American in the Gulag&quot; (), by a member of the US Embassy, and &quot;I Was a Slave in Russia&quot; an American factory owner&#x27;s son, were two more American citizens interned who wrote of their ordeal. They were interned due to their American citizenship for about eight years c. 1946–55.
* Yevgenia Ginzburg wrote two famous books about her remembrances, &quot;Journey Into the Whirlwind&quot; and &quot;Within the Whirlwind&quot;.
*Savić Marković Štedimlija, a pro-Croatian Montenegrin ideologist. Caught in Austria by the Red Army in 1945, he was sent to the USSR and spent ten years in the Gulag. After his release, Marković wrote his autobiographical account in two volumes titled &quot;Ten years in Gulag&quot; (&quot;Deset godina u Gulagu&quot;, Matica crnogorska, Podgorica, Montenegro 2004).
* Anița Nandriș-Cudla&#x27;s book, &quot;20 Years in Siberia [20 de ani în Siberia]&quot; is the own life&#x27;s account written by a Romanian peasant woman from Bucovina (Mahala village near Cernăuți) who managed to survive the harsh, forced labor system together with her three sons. Together with her husband and her three underage children, she was deported from Mahala village to the Soviet Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, at the Polar Circle, without a trial or even a communicated accusation. The same night of June 12 to 13, 1941, (that is, just before Germany&#x27;s invasion of the USSR), overall 602 fellow villagers were arrested and deported, without any prior notice. Her mother received the same sentence but was spared from deportation after the fact that she was a paraplegic was acknowledged by the authorities. It was later discovered that the reason for her deportation and forced labor was the fake and nonsensical claim that, allegedly, her husband had been a mayor in the Romanian administration, a politician and a rich peasant, none of the latter of which was true. Separated from her husband, she brought up the three boys, overcame typhus, scorbutus, malnutrition, extreme cold and harsh toils, to later return to Bucovina after rehabilitation. Her manuscript was written toward the end of her life, in the simple and direct language of a peasant with three years of public school education, and was secretly brought to Romania before the fall of Romanian communism, in 1982. Her manuscript was first published in 1991. Her deportation was shared mainly with Romanians from Bucovina and Basarabia, Finnish and Polish prisoners, as token proof to show that Gulag labor camps had also been used for the shattering/ extermination of the natives in the newly occupied territories of the Soviet Union.
* Frantsishak Alyakhnovich – Solovki prisoner
* Blagoy Popov, a Bulgarian communist and a defendant in the Leipzig trial, along with Georgi Dimitrov and Vasil Tanev, was arrested in 1937 during the Stalinist purges and spent seventeen years in Norillag. Popov was released in 1954, after the death of Stalin, and returned to Bulgaria. He wrote his autobiographical account in the book &quot;From the Leipzig trial to the Siberia camps&quot; (&quot;От Лайпцигския процес в Сибирските лагери&quot;, Изток-Запад, София, България, 2012 ).
* Mkrtich Armen, an Armenian writer who was imprisoned in 1937 and rehabilitated in 1945, published a collection of his memories under the title &quot;They Ordered to Give You&quot; in 1964.
* Gurgen Mahari, an Armenian writer and poet, who was arrested in 1936, released in 1947, arrested again in 1948 and sent into Siberian exile as an &quot;unreliable type&quot; until 1954, wrote &quot;Barbed Wires in Blossom&quot;, a novella based largely on his personal experiences in a Soviet gulag.
* Gulag Boss: A Soviet Memoir is a 2011 memoir by Fyodor Vasilevich Mochulsky (1918–1999), a Soviet Engineer and eventual head of numerous Gulag camps in the northern Russian region of Pechorlag, Pechora, from 1940 to 1946.

=== Colonization ===

Soviet show that the goals of the gulag included colonization of sparsely populated remote areas and exploiting its resources using forced labor. In 1929, OGPU was given the task to colonize these areas. To this end, the notion of &quot;free settlement&quot; was introduced. On 12 April 1930 Genrikh Yagoda wrote to the OGPU Commission:

When well-behaved persons had served the majority of their terms, they could be released for &quot;free settlement&quot; (вольное поселение, &quot;volnoye poseleniye&quot;) outside the confinement of the camp. They were known as &quot;free settlers&quot; (; not to be confused with the term , &quot;exile settlers&quot;). In addition, for persons who served full term, but who were denied the free choice of place of residence, it was recommended to assign them for &quot;free settlement&quot; and give them land in the general vicinity of the place of confinement.

The gulag inherited this approach from the katorga system.

It is estimated that of the 40,000 people collecting state pensions in Vorkuta, 32,000 are trapped former gulag inmates, or their descendants.

=== Economics ===
According to a 2024 study, areas near gulag camps that held a larger share of educated elites among its prisoner population have subsequently been characterized by greater economic growth. According to the authors, it demonstrates long-run persistence of human capital across generations.

=== Life after a term was served ===
Persons who served a term in a camp or prison were restricted from taking a wide range of jobs. Concealment of a previous imprisonment was a triable offence. Persons who served terms as &quot;politicals&quot; were nuisances for &quot;First Departments&quot; (, outlets of the secret police at all enterprises and institutions), because former &quot;politicals&quot; had to be monitored.

Many people who were released from camps were restricted from settling in larger cities.

== Memorialization ==

=== Gulag memorials ===


Both Moscow and St. Petersburg have memorials to the victims of the Gulag made of boulders from the Solovki camp — the first prison camp in the Gulag system. Moscow&#x27;s memorial is on Lubyanka Square, the site of the headquarters of the NKVD. People gather at these memorials every year on the Day of Victims of the Repression (October 30).

=== Gulag Museum ===
Moscow has the State Gulag Museum whose first director was Anton Antonov-Ovseyenko. In 2015, another museum dedicated to the Gulag was opened in Moscow.

<text>A Geiger counter (, ; also known as a Geiger–Müller counter or G-M counter) is an electronic instrument for detecting and measuring ionizing radiation with the use of a Geiger–Müller tube. It is widely used in applications such as radiation dosimetry, radiological protection, experimental physics and the nuclear industry.

&quot;Geiger counter&quot; is often used generically to refer to any form of dosimeter (or, &quot;radiation-measuring device&quot;), but scientifically, a Geiger counter is only one specific type of dosimeter.

It detects ionizing radiation such as alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays using the ionization effect produced in a Geiger–Müller tube, which gives its name to the instrument. In wide and prominent use as a hand-held radiation survey instrument, it is perhaps one of the world&#x27;s best-known radiation detection instruments.

The original detection principle was realized in 1908 at the University of Manchester, but it was not until the development of the Geiger–Müller tube in 1928 that the Geiger counter could be produced as a practical instrument. Since then, it has been very popular due to its robust sensing element and relatively low cost. However, there are limitations in measuring high radiation rates and the energy of incident radiation.

The Geiger counter is one of the first examples of data sonification.

==Principle of operation==
A Geiger counter consists of a Geiger–Müller tube (the sensing element which detects the radiation) and the processing electronics, which display the result.

The Geiger–Müller tube is filled with an inert gas such as helium, neon, or argon at low pressure, to which a high voltage is applied. The tube briefly conducts electrical charge when high energy particles or gamma radiation make the gas conductive by ionization. The ionization is considerably amplified within the tube by the Townsend discharge effect to produce an easily measured detection pulse, which is fed to the processing and display electronics. This large pulse from the tube makes the Geiger counter relatively cheap to manufacture, as the subsequent electronics are greatly simplified. The electronics also generate the high voltage, typically 400–900 volts, that has to be applied to the Geiger–Müller tube to enable its operation. This voltage must be carefully selected, as too high a voltage will allow for continuous discharge, damaging the instrument and invalidating the results. Conversely, too low a voltage will result in an electric field that is too weak to generate a current pulse. The correct voltage is usually specified by the manufacturer. To help quickly terminate each discharge in the tube a small amount of halogen gas or organic material known as a quenching mixture is added to the fill gas.
===Readout===
There are two types of detected radiation readout: counts and radiation dose.

* The counts display is the simplest, and shows the number of ionizing events detected, displayed either as a count rate, such as &quot;counts per minute&quot; or &quot;counts per second&quot;, or as a total number of counts over a set time period (an integrated total). The counts readout is normally used when alpha or beta particles are being detected.
* More complex to achieve is a display of radiation dose rate, displayed in units such as the sievert, which is normally used for measuring gamma or X-ray dose rates. A Geiger–Müller tube can detect the presence of radiation, but not its energy, which influences the radiation&#x27;s ionizing effect. Consequently, instruments measuring dose rate require the use of an energy compensated Geiger–Müller tube, so that the dose displayed relates to the counts detected. The electronics will apply known factors to make this conversion, which is specific to each instrument and is determined by design and calibration.

The readout can be analog or digital, and modern instruments offer serial communications with a host computer or network.

There is usually an option to produce audible clicks representing the number of ionization events detected. This is the distinctive sound associated with handheld or portable Geiger counters. The purpose of this is to allow the user to concentrate on manipulation of the instrument while retaining auditory feedback on the radiation rate.

===Limitations===
There are two main limitations of the Geiger counter:
# Because the output pulse from a Geiger–Müller tube is always of the same magnitude (regardless of the energy of the incident radiation), the tube cannot differentiate between radiation types or measure radiation energy, which prevents it from correctly measuring dose rate.
# The tube is less accurate at high radiation rates, because each ionization event is followed by a &quot;dead time&quot;, an insensitive period during which any further incident radiation does not result in a count. Typically, the dead time will reduce indicated count rates above about 104 to 105 counts per second, depending on the characteristic of the tube being used. While some counters have circuitry which can compensate for this, for measuring very high dose rates, ion chamber instruments are preferred for high radiation rates.

==Types and applications==
The intended detection application of a Geiger counter dictates the tube design used. Consequently, there are a great many designs, but they can be generally categorized as &quot;end-window&quot;, windowless &quot;thin-walled&quot;, &quot;thick-walled&quot;, and sometimes hybrids of these types.

===Particle detection===
The first historical uses of the Geiger principle were to detect α- and β-particles, and the instrument is still used for this purpose today. For α-particles and low energy β-particles, the &quot;end-window&quot; type of a Geiger–Müller tube has to be used, as these particles have a limited range and are easily stopped by a solid material. Therefore, the tube requires a window which is thin enough to allow as many as possible of these particles through to the fill gas. The window is usually made of mica with a density of about 1.5–2.0 mg/cm2.

α-particles have the shortest range, and to detect these the window should ideally be within 10 mm of the radiation source due to α-particle attenuation. However, the Geiger–Müller tube produces a pulse output which is the same magnitude for all detected radiation, so a Geiger counter with an end window tube cannot distinguish between α- and β-particles. A skilled operator can use varying distance from a radiation source to differentiate between α- and high energy β-particles.

The &quot;pancake&quot; Geiger–Müller tube is a variant of the end-window probe, but designed with a larger detection area to make checking quicker. However, the pressure of the atmosphere against the low pressure of the fill gas limits the window size due to the limited strength of the window membrane.

Some β-particles can also be detected by a thin-walled &quot;windowless&quot; Geiger–Müller tube, which has no end-window, but allows high energy β-particles to pass through the tube walls. Although the tube walls have a greater stopping power than a thin end-window, they still allow these more energetic particles to reach the fill gas.

End-window Geiger counters are still used as a general purpose, portable, radioactive contamination measurement and detection instrument, owing to their relatively low cost, robustness and relatively high detection efficiency; particularly with high energy β-particles. However, for discrimination between α- and β-particles or provision of particle energy information, scintillation counters or proportional counters should be used. Those instrument types are manufactured with much larger detector areas, which means that checking for surface contamination is quicker than with a Geiger counter.

===Gamma and X-ray detection===

Geiger counters are widely used to detect gamma radiation and X-rays, collectively known as photons, and for this the windowless tube is used. However, detection efficiency is low compared to alpha and beta particles.
The article on the Geiger–Müller tube carries a more detailed account of the techniques used to detect photon radiation. For high energy photons, the tube relies on the interaction of the radiation with the tube wall, usually a material with a high atomic number such as stainless steel of 1–2 mm thickness, to produce free electrons within the tube wall, due to the photoelectric effect. If these migrate out of the tube wall, they enter and ionize the fill gas.

This effect increases the detection efficiency because the low-pressure gas in the tube has poorer interaction with higher energy photons than a steel tube. However, as photon energies decrease to low levels, there is greater gas interaction, and the contribution of direct gas interaction increases. At very low energies (less than 25 keV), direct gas ionisation dominates, and a steel tube attenuates the incident photons. Consequently, at these energies, a typical tube design is a long tube with a thin wall which has a larger gas volume, to give an increased chance of direct interaction of a particle with the fill gas.

Above these low energy levels, there is a considerable variance in response to different photon energies of the same intensity, and a steel-walled tube employs what is known as &quot;energy compensation&quot; in the form of filter rings around the naked tube, which attempts to compensate for these variations over a large energy range. A steel-walled Geiger–Müller tube is about 1% efficient over a wide range of energies.

===Neutron detection===

A variation of the Geiger tube can be used to exclusively measure radiation dosage from neutrons rather than from gammas by the process of neutron capture. The tube, which can contain the fill gas boron trifluoride or helium-3, is surrounded by a plastic moderator that reduces neutron energies prior to capture. When a capture occurs in the fill gas, the energy released is registered in the detector.
===Gamma measurement—personnel protection and process control===
While &quot;Geiger counter&quot; is practically synonymous with the hand-held variety, the Geiger principle is in wide use in installed &quot;area gamma&quot; alarms for personnel protection, as well as in process measurement and interlock applications. The processing electronics of such installations have a higher degree of sophistication and reliability than those of hand-held meters.

===Physical design===

For hand-held units there are two fundamental physical configurations: the &quot;integral&quot; unit with both detector and electronics in the same unit, and the &quot;two-piece&quot; design which has a separate detector probe and an electronics module connected by a short cable.

In the 1930s a mica window was added to the cylindrical design allowing low-penetration radiation to pass through with ease.

The integral unit allows single-handed operation, so the operator can use the other hand for personal security in challenging monitoring positions, but the two piece design allows easier manipulation of the detector, and is commonly used for alpha and beta surface contamination monitoring where careful manipulation of the probe is required or the weight of the electronics module would make operation unwieldy. A number of different sized detectors are available to suit particular situations, such as placing the probe in small apertures or confined spaces.

Gamma and X-Ray detectors generally use an &quot;integral&quot; design so the Geiger–Müller tube is conveniently within the electronics enclosure. This can easily be achieved because the casing usually has little attenuation, and is employed in ambient gamma measurements where distance from the source of radiation is not a significant factor. However, to facilitate more localised measurements such as &quot;surface dose&quot;, the position of the tube in the enclosure is sometimes indicated by targets on the enclosure so an accurate measurement can be made with the tube at the correct orientation and a known distance from the surface.

There is a particular type of gamma instrument known as a &quot;hot spot&quot; detector which has the detector tube on the end of a long pole or flexible conduit. These are used to measure high radiation gamma locations whilst protecting the operator by means of distance shielding.

Particle detection of alpha and beta can be used in both integral and two-piece designs. A pancake probe (for alpha/beta) is generally used to increase the area of detection in two-piece instruments whilst being relatively light weight. In integral instruments using an end window tube there is a window in the body of the casing to prevent shielding of particles. There are also hybrid instruments which have a separate probe for particle detection and a gamma detection tube within the electronics module. The detectors are switchable by the operator, depending the radiation type that is being measured.

===Guidance on application use===
In the United Kingdom the National Radiological Protection Board issued a user guidance note on selecting the best portable instrument type for the radiation measurement application concerned. This covers all radiation protection instrument technologies and includes a guide to the use of G-M detectors.

==History==
In 1908 Hans Geiger, under the supervision of Ernest Rutherford at the Victoria University of Manchester (now the University of Manchester), developed an experimental technique for detecting alpha particles that would later be used to develop the Geiger–Müller tube in 1928. This early counter was only capable of detecting alpha particles and was part of a larger experimental apparatus. The fundamental ionization mechanism used was discovered by John Sealy Townsend between 1897 and 1901, and is known as the Townsend discharge, which is the ionization of molecules by ion impact.

It was not until 1928 that Geiger and Walther Müller (a PhD student of Geiger) developed the sealed Geiger–Müller tube which used basic ionization principles previously used experimentally. Small and rugged, not only could it detect alpha and beta radiation as prior models had done, but also gamma radiation. Now a practical radiation instrument could be produced relatively cheaply, and so the Geiger counter was born. As the tube output required little electronic processing, a distinct advantage in the thermionic valve era due to minimal valve count and low power consumption, the instrument achieved great popularity as a portable radiation detector.

Modern versions of the Geiger counter use halogen quench gases, a technique invented in 1947 by Sidney H. Liebson. Halogen compounds have superseded the organic quench gases because of their much longer life and lower operating voltages; typically 400-900 volts.

<text>The General Synod is the title of the governing body of some church organizations. 
==Anglican Communion==
The General Synod of the Church of England, which was established in 1970 replacing the Church Assembly, is the legislative body of the Church of England.

The equivalent In the Episcopal Church in the United States is the General Convention.

Several other churches in the Anglican Communion also have General Synods:
*Anglican Church of Australia
*Anglican Church of Canada
*Church of Ireland
*Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia
*Scottish Episcopal Church
*Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui (Anglican Church in Hong Kong)

==Other churches==
The United Church of Christ, based in the United States, also calls its main governing body a General Synod. It meets every two years and consists of over 600 delegates from various congregations and conferences.

The Missionary Baptist Conference of the USA calls their main governing body a General Synod. It meets annually to set the theological and missional direction for the denomi-network. 

The Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church (ARP) has the General Synod as its highest church court. The ARP General Synod meets yearly and in recent years has, almost without exception, been held at the Bonclarken in North Carolina. The delegates to the General Synod consists of the elder representatives elected from each church&#x27;s session and all ministers from all presbyteries that comprise the Church (excluding ministers and elders from the independent ARP Synods of Mexico and Pakistan).

The Evangelical Church of Augsburg and Helvetic Confession in Austria and the United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany each call their main legislative bodies . The legislative body In the Evangelical Church in Prussia was called between 1846 and 1953.

The governing body of the Reformed Church in America, a Calvinist denomination in the United States and Canada, is known as the General Synod.

, the governing body of the Church of Norway, is normally translated as General Synod. It convenes once a year, and consists of 85 representatives, of whom seven or eight are sent from each of the dioceses.

The Batak Christian Protestant Church (BPCP), or &quot;Huria Kristen Batak Protestan&quot; (abbreviated HKBP), held a twice-a-year General Synod (Sinode Godang), to discuss about matters in HKBP, and to elect the new &quot;Ephorus&quot; (or Board) for the HKBP. The first General Synod of HKBP was held in 1922.

==Other uses==
In North America, the Evangelical Lutheran General Synod of the United States of North America, often referred to as the General Synod, was a Lutheran church body that existed from 1820 to 1918.

<doc id="12987" wikidata="Q476310" url="?curid=12987" title="Gerrymandering">
<text>In representative electoral systems, gerrymandering ( , originally ) is the political manipulation of electoral district boundaries to advantage a party, group, or socioeconomic class within the constituency. The manipulation may involve &quot;cracking&quot; (diluting the voting power of the opposing party&#x27;s supporters across many districts) or &quot;packing&quot; (concentrating the opposing party&#x27;s voting power in one district to reduce their voting power in other districts). Gerrymandering can also be used to protect incumbents. Wayne Dawkins, a professor at Morgan State University, describes it as politicians picking their voters instead of voters picking their politicians.

The term &quot;gerrymandering&quot; is a portmanteau of a salamander and Elbridge Gerry, Vice President of the United States at the time of his death, who, as governor of Massachusetts in 1812, signed a bill that created a partisan district in the Boston area that was compared to the shape of a mythological salamander. The term has negative connotations, and gerrymandering is almost always considered a corruption of the democratic process. The word &quot;gerrymander&quot; () can be used both as a verb for the process and as a noun for a resulting district.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;gerrymander&quot; (originally written &quot;Gerry-mander&quot;; a portmanteau of the name &quot;Gerry&quot; and the animal &quot;salamander&quot;) was used for the first time in the &quot;Boston Gazette&quot; on 26 March 1812 in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. This word was created in reaction to a redrawing of Massachusetts Senate election districts under Governor Elbridge Gerry, later Vice President of the United States. Gerry, who personally disapproved of the practice, signed a bill that redistricted Massachusetts for the benefit of the Democratic-Republican Party. When mapped, one of the contorted districts in the Boston area was said to resemble a mythological salamander. Appearing with the term, and helping spread and sustain its popularity, was a political cartoon depicting a strange animal with claws, wings and a dragon-like head that supposedly resembled the oddly shaped district.

The cartoon was most likely drawn by Elkanah Tisdale, an early-19th-century painter, designer, and engraver who lived in Boston at the time. Tisdale had the engraving skills to cut the woodblocks to print the original cartoon. These woodblocks survive and are preserved in the Library of Congress. The creator of the term &quot;gerrymander&quot;, however, may never be definitively established. Historians widely believe that the Federalist newspaper editors Nathan Hale and Benjamin and John Russell coined the term, but there is no definitive evidence as to who created or uttered the word for the first time.

The redistricting was a notable success for Gerry&#x27;s Democratic-Republican Party. In the 1812 election, both the Massachusetts House and governorship were comfortably won by Federalists, losing Gerry his job, but the redistricted state senate remained firmly in Democratic-Republican hands.

The word &quot;gerrymander&quot; was reprinted numerous times in Federalist newspapers in Massachusetts, New England, and nationwide for the rest of 1812. This suggests an organized activity by the Federalists to disparage Gerry in particular and the growing Democratic-Republican party in general. &quot;Gerrymandering&quot; soon began to be used to describe cases of district shape manipulation for partisan gain in other states. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary,&quot; the word&#x27;s acceptance was marked by its publication in a dictionary (1848) and in an encyclopedia (1868). Since the eponymous &quot;Gerry&quot; is pronounced with a hard g as in &quot;get&quot;, the word &quot;gerrymander&quot; was originally pronounced , but pronunciation as , with a soft g as in &quot;gentle,&quot; has become dominant. Residents of Marblehead, Massachusetts, Gerry&#x27;s hometown, continue to use the original pronunciation.

From time to time, other names have been suffixed with &quot;-mander&quot; to tie a particular effort to a particular politician or group. Examples are the 1852 &quot;Henry-mandering&quot;, &quot;Jerrymander&quot; (referring to California Governor Jerry Brown), &quot;Perrymander&quot; (a reference to Texas Governor Rick Perry), &quot;Tullymander&quot; (after the Irish politician James Tully), and &quot;Bjelkemander&quot; (referencing Australian politician Joh Bjelke-Petersen).

==Tactics==
Gerrymandering&#x27;s primary goals are to maximize the effect of supporters&#x27; votes and minimize the effect of opponents&#x27; votes. A partisan gerrymander&#x27;s main purpose is to influence not only the districting statute but the entire corpus of legislative decisions enacted in its path.

These can be accomplished in a number of ways:

* &quot;Cracking&quot; involves spreading voters of a particular type among many districts in order to deny them a sufficiently large voting bloc in any particular district. Political parties in charge of redrawing district lines may create more &quot;cracked&quot; districts as a means of retaining, and possibly even expanding, their legislative power. By &quot;cracking&quot; districts, a political party can maintain, or gain, legislative control by ensuring that the opposing party&#x27;s voters are not the majority in specific districts. For example, the voters in an urban area can be split among several districts in each of which the majority of voters are suburban, on the presumption that the two groups would vote differently, and the suburban voters would be far more likely to get their way in the elections.
* &quot;Packing&quot; is the practice of concentrating a large number of similar voters into a single district, thereby limiting their influence in other districts. This approach can sometimes be used to ensure representation for a community, such as by creating a majority-minority district. However, it can also be used to diminish a group&#x27;s overall electoral impact. When the party in control of redistricting holds a statewide minority, packing may be used strategically to concede a few districts while maintaining greater control over the remaining ones.
* &quot;Hijacking&quot; redraws two districts in such a way as to force two incumbents to run against each other in one district, ensuring that one of them will be eliminated.
* &quot;Kidnapping&quot; moves an incumbent&#x27;s home address into another district. Reelection can become more difficult when the incumbent no longer resides in the district or faces reelection in a new district with a new voter base. This is often employed against politicians who represent multiple urban areas: larger cities are removed from the district to make it more rural.

These tactics are typically combined in some form, creating a few &quot;forfeit&quot; seats for packed voters of one type in order to secure more seats and greater representation for voters of another type. This results in candidates of one party (the one responsible for the gerrymandering) winning by small majorities in most of the districts, and another party winning by a large majority in only a few. Any party that endeavors to make a district more favorable to voting for it based on the physical boundary is gerrymandering.

==Effects==

Gerrymandering is effective because of the wasted vote effect. &quot;Wasted votes&quot; are votes that did not contribute to electing a candidate, either because they were in excess of the number needed for victory or because the candidate lost. By moving geographic boundaries, the incumbent party packs opposition voters into a few districts they will already win, wasting the extra votes. Other districts are more tightly constructed, with the opposition party allowed a bare minority count, thereby wasting all the minority votes for the losing candidate. These districts constitute the majority of districts and are drawn to produce a result favoring the incumbent party.

A quantitative measure of the effect of gerrymandering is the efficiency gap, computed from the difference in the wasted votes for two different political parties summed over all the districts. Citing in part an efficiency gap of 11.69% to 13%, a U.S. District Court in 2016 ruled against the 2011 drawing of Wisconsin legislative districts. In the 2012 election for the state legislature, that gap in wasted votes meant that one party had 48.6% of the two-party votes but won 61% of the 99 districts.

The wasted vote effect is strongest when a party wins by narrow margins across multiple districts, but gerrymandering narrow margins can be risky when voters are less predictable. To minimize the risk of demographic or political shifts swinging a district to the opposition, politicians can create more packed districts, leading to more comfortable margins in unpacked ones.

===Effect on electoral competition===


Some political science research suggests that, contrary to common belief, gerrymandering does not decrease electoral competition and can even increase it. Some say that, rather than packing the voters of their party into uncompetitive districts, party leaders tend to prefer to spread their party&#x27;s voters into multiple districts so that their party can win more races. (See scenario (c) in the box.) This may lead to increased competition. Instead of gerrymandering, some researchers find that other factors, such as partisan polarization and the incumbency advantage, have driven the recent decreases in electoral competition. Similarly, a 2009 study found that &quot;congressional polarization is primarily a function of the differences in how Democrats and Republicans represent the same districts rather than a function of which districts each party represents or the distribution of constituency preferences.&quot;

One state in which gerrymandering has arguably had an adverse effect on electoral competition is California. In 2000, a bipartisan redistricting effort redrew congressional district lines in ways that all but guaranteed incumbent victories; as a result, California saw only one congressional seat change hands between 2000 and 2010. In response to this obvious gerrymandering, a 2010 referendum in California gave the power to redraw congressional district lines to the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, which had been created to draw California State Senate and Assembly districts by a 2008 referendum. In stark contrast to the redistricting efforts that followed the 2000 census, the redistricting commission has created a number of the most competitive congressional districts in the country.

===Increased incumbent advantage and campaign costs===
The effect of gerrymandering for incumbents is particularly advantageous, as they are far more likely to be reelected under conditions of gerrymandering. For example, in 2002, according to political scientists Norman Ornstein and Thomas Mann, only four challengers were able to defeat incumbent members of the U.S. Congress, the lowest number in modern American history. Incumbents are likely to be of the majority party orchestrating a gerrymander, and are usually easily renominated in subsequent elections, including incumbents among the minority.

Mann, a Senior Fellow of Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution, has also noted that &quot;Redistricting is a deeply political process, with incumbents actively seeking to minimize the risk to themselves (via bipartisan gerrymanders) or to gain additional seats for their party (via partisan gerrymanders)&quot;. The bipartisan gerrymandering Mann mentions refers to the fact that legislators often draw distorted legislative districts even when doing so does not give their party an advantage.

Gerrymandering of state legislative districts can effectively guarantee an incumbent&#x27;s victory by &quot;shoring up&quot; a district with higher levels of partisan support, without disproportionately benefiting a particular political party. This can be highly problematic from a governance perspective, because forming districts to ensure high levels of partisanship often leads to higher levels of partisanship in legislative bodies. If a substantial number of districts are designed to be polarized, then those districts&#x27; representation will also likely act in a heavily partisan manner, which can create and perpetuate partisan gridlock.

Gerrymandering can thus have a deleterious effect on the principle of democratic accountability. With uncompetitive seats/districts reducing the fear that incumbent politicians may lose office, they have less incentive to represent their constituents&#x27; interests, even when those interests conform to majority support for an issue across the electorate as a whole. Incumbent politicians may look out more for their party&#x27;s interests than for those of their constituents.

Gerrymandering can affect campaign costs for district elections. If districts become increasingly stretched out, candidates may incur higher costs for transportation and campaign advertising across a district. The incumbent&#x27;s advantage in campaign fundraising is another benefit of having a gerrymandered seat.

===Less descriptive representation===
Gerrymandering also has significant effects on the representation voters receive in gerrymandered districts. Because gerrymandering can be designed to increase the number of wasted votes among the electorate, the relative representation of particular groups can be drastically altered from their actual share of the voting population. This effect can significantly prevent a gerrymandered system from achieving proportional and descriptive representation, as the winners of elections are increasingly determined by who is drawing the districts, rather than the voters&#x27; preferences.

Gerrymandering may be advocated to improve representation within the legislature among otherwise underrepresented minority groups by packing them into a single district. This can be controversial, as it may lead to those groups&#x27; remaining marginalized in the government as they become confined to a single district. Candidates outside that district no longer need to represent them to win elections.

As an example, much of the redistricting conducted in the U.S. in the early 1990s involved the intentional creation of additional &quot;majority-minority&quot; districts where racial minorities such as African Americans were packed into the majority. This &quot;maximization policy&quot; drew support from both the Republican Party (which had limited support among African Americans and could concentrate its power elsewhere) and by minority representatives elected as Democrats from these constituencies, who then had safe seats. 

The 2012 election provides a number of examples of how partisan gerrymandering can adversely affect the descriptive function of states&#x27; congressional delegations. In Pennsylvania, for example, Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives received 83,000 more votes than Republican candidates, yet the Republican-controlled redistricting process in 2010 resulted in Democrats losing to their Republican counterparts in 13 of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 18 districts.

In the seven states where Republicans had complete control over the redistricting process, Republican House candidates received 16.7 million votes and Democratic House candidates received 16.4 million. The redistricting resulted in Republican victories in 73 out of the 107 affected seats; in those seven states, Republicans received 50.4% of the votes but won in over 68% of the congressional districts. While it is but one example of how gerrymandering can have a significant effect on election outcomes, this kind of disproportional representation of the public will seems problematic for the legitimacy of democratic systems, regardless of one&#x27;s political affiliation.

In Michigan, redistricting was conducted by a Republican legislature in 2011. Federal congressional districts were designed so that cities such as Battle Creek, Grand Rapids, Jackson, Kalamazoo, Lansing, and East Lansing were separated into districts with large conservative-leaning hinterlands that diluted the Democratic votes in those cities in Congressional elections. Since 2022 some districts have been redrawn to just include the greater metropolitan areas. The Kent County seat is currently held by Hilary Scholten, a Democratic. landslide.

===Incumbent gerrymandering===
Gerrymandering can also be done to help incumbents as a whole, effectively making every district a packed one and greatly reducing the potential for competitive elections. This is particularly likely to occur when the minority party has significant obstruction power: unable to enact a partisan gerrymander, the legislature instead agrees to ensure its own reelection.

In an unusual occurrence in 2000, for example, the two dominant parties in the state of California cooperatively redrew both state and federal legislative districts to preserve the status quo, insulating the incumbents from unpredictable voting. This move proved completely effective, as no state or federal legislative office changed party in the 2004 election, although 53 congressional, 20 state senate, and 80 state assembly seats were potentially at risk.

In 2006, the term &quot;70/30 district&quot; came to signify the equitable split of two evenly split (i.e. 50/50) districts. The resulting districts gave each party a guaranteed seat and retained their respective power base.

Since the first handshake deal in 1981, whereby Republicans informally controlled the state senate redistricting process and Democrats informally controlled the state assembly redistricting process, New York has experienced some of the nation&#x27;s least competitive legislative elections. One study by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School found that over one ten-year period, as many members of the state legislature died in office as were defeated in elections. More than 99% of the incumbents contesting a primary or general election won their races.

===Prison-based gerrymandering===
Prison-based gerrymandering occurs when prisoners are counted as residents of a district, increasing its population with non-voters when assigning political apportionment. This phenomenon violates the principle of one person, one vote because, although many prisoners come from (and return to) urban communities, they are counted as &quot;residents&quot; of the rural districts that contain large prisons, artificially inflating the political representation in districts with prisons at the expense of voters in districts without them. Others contend that prisoners should not be counted as residents of their original districts when they do not reside there and are not legally eligible to vote.

==Changes to achieve competitive elections==

Due to the perceived issues associated with gerrymandering and its effect on competitive elections and democratic accountability, numerous countries have enacted reforms making the practice more difficult or less effective. Countries such as the UK, Australia, Canada and most of those in Europe have transferred responsibility for defining constituency boundaries to neutral or cross-party bodies. In Spain, they are constitutionally fixed since 1978. Open party-list proportional representation makes gerrymandering obsolete by erasing district lines and empowering voters to rank a list of candidates any party puts forth. This method is used in Austria, Brazil, Sweden, and Switzerland.

In the U.S., such reforms are controversial and face particularly strong opposition from groups that benefit from gerrymandering. In a more neutral system, they might lose considerable influence.

=== Redistricting by neutral or cross-party agency ===
The most commonly advocated electoral reform proposal targeted at gerrymandering is to change the redistricting process. Under these proposals, an independent and presumably objective commission is created specifically for redistricting, rather than having the legislature do it.

This is the system used in the UK, where independent boundary commissions determine the boundaries for constituencies in the House of Commons and the devolved legislatures, subject to ratification by the body in question (almost always granted without debate). A similar situation exists in Australia, where the independent Australian Electoral Commission and its state-based counterparts determine electoral boundaries for federal, state and local jurisdictions.

To help ensure neutrality, members of a redistricting agency may be appointed from relatively apolitical sources, such as retired judges or longstanding members of the civil service, possibly with requirements for adequate representation among competing political parties. Additionally, members of the board can be denied information that might aid in gerrymandering, such as the demographic makeup or voting patterns of the population.

As a further constraint, consensus requirements can be imposed to ensure that the resulting district map reflects a wider perception of fairness, such as a requirement for a supermajority approval of the commission for any district proposal. But consensus requirements can lead to deadlock, as occurred in Missouri following the 2000 census. There, the equally numbered partisan appointees were unable to reach consensus in a reasonable time, and so the courts had to determine district lines.

In the U.S. state of Iowa, the nonpartisan Legislative Services Bureau (LSB, akin to the U.S. Congressional Research Service) determines electoral district boundaries. Aside from satisfying federally mandated contiguity and population equality criteria, the LSB mandates unity of counties and cities. Consideration of political factors such as location of incumbents, previous boundary locations, and political party proportions is specifically forbidden. Since Iowa&#x27;s counties are chiefly regularly shaped polygons, the LSB process has led to districts that follow county lines.

In 2005, the U.S. state of Ohio had a ballot measure to create an independent commission whose first priority was competitive districts, a sort of &quot;reverse gerrymander&quot;. A complex mathematical formula was to be used to determine the competitiveness of a district. The measure failed voter approval chiefly due to voter concerns that communities of interest would be broken up.

In 2017, Representative John Delaney submitted the Open Our Democracy Act of 2017 to the U.S. House of Representatives as a means to implement nonpartisan redistricting. It ultimately did not pass. 

=== Redistricting by partisan competition ===
Many redistricting reforms seek to remove partisanship to ensure fairness in the redistricting process. The I-cut-you-choose method achieves fairness by putting the two major-parties in direct competition. I-cut-you-choose is a fair division method to divide resources amongst two parties, regardless of which party cuts first. This method typically relies on assumptions of contiguity of districts but ignores all other constraints such as keeping communities of interest together. This method has been applied to nominal redistricting problems but it generally has less public interest than other types of redistricting reforms. The I-cut-you-choose concept was popularized by the board game Berrymandering. Problems with this method arise when minor parties are shut-out of the process which will reinforce the two-party system. Additionally, while this method is provably fair to the two parties creating the districts, it is not necessarily fair to the communities they represent.

===Transparency regulations===
When a single political party controls both legislative houses of a state during redistricting, both Democrats and Republicans have displayed a marked propensity for couching the process in secrecy; in May 2010, for example, the Republican National Committee held a redistricting training session in Ohio where the theme was &quot;Keep it Secret, Keep it Safe&quot;. A 2012 investigation by The Center for Public Integrity reviewed every state&#x27;s redistricting processes for both transparency and potential for public input, and ultimately assigned 24 states grades of either D or F.

In response to these types of problems, redistricting transparency legislation has been introduced to US Congress a number of times in recent years, including the Redistricting Transparency Acts of 2010, 2011, and 2013. Such policy proposals aim to increase the transparency and responsiveness of the redistricting systems in the US. The merit of increasing transparency in redistricting processes is based largely on the premise that lawmakers would be less inclined to draw gerrymandered districts if they were forced to defend such districts in a public forum.

===Changing the voting system===
As gerrymandering relies on the wasted-vote effect, the use of a different voting system with fewer wasted votes can help reduce gerrymandering. In particular, the use of multi-member districts alongside voting systems establishing proportional representation such as party-list proportional representation or single transferable voting can reduce wasted votes and gerrymandering. Semi-proportional voting systems such as single non-transferable vote or cumulative voting are relatively simple and similar to &quot;first past the post&quot; and can also reduce the proportion of wasted votes and thus potential gerrymandering. Electoral reformers have advocated all three as replacement systems.

Electoral systems with various forms of proportional representation are now found in nearly all European countries, resulting in multi-party systems (with many parties represented in the parliaments) with higher voter attendance in the elections, fewer wasted votes, and a wider variety of political opinions represented.

Electoral systems with election of just one winner in each district (i.e., &quot;winner-takes-all&quot; electoral systems) and no proportional distribution of extra mandates to smaller parties tend to create two-party systems. This effect, labeled &quot;Duverger&#x27;s law&quot; by political scientists, was described by Maurice Duverger.

===Using fixed districts===
Another way to avoid gerrymandering is simply to stop redistricting altogether and use existing political boundaries such as state, county, or provincial lines. While this prevents future gerrymandering, any existing advantage may become deeply ingrained. The United States Senate, for instance, has more competitive elections than the House of Representatives due to the use of existing state borders rather than gerrymandered districts—Senators are elected by their entire state, while Representatives are elected in legislatively drawn districts.

The use of fixed districts creates an additional problem, however, in that fixed districts do not take into account changes in population. Individual voters can come to have very different degrees of influence on the legislative process. This malapportionment can greatly affect representation after long periods of time or large population movements. In the United Kingdom during the Industrial Revolution, several constituencies that had been fixed since they gained representation in the Parliament of England became so small that they could be won with only a handful of voters (&quot;rotten boroughs&quot;). Similarly, in the U.S. the Alabama Legislature refused to redistrict for more than 60 years, despite major changes in population patterns. By 1960 less than a quarter of the state&#x27;s population controlled the majority of seats in the legislature. This practice of using fixed districts for state legislatures was effectively banned in the United States after the &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; Supreme Court decision in 1964, establishing a rule of one man, one vote.

===Objective rules to create districts===
Another means to reduce gerrymandering is to create objective, precise criteria with which any district map must comply. Courts in the United States, for instance, have ruled that congressional districts must be contiguous in order to be constitutional. This, however, is not a particularly effective constraint, as very narrow strips of land with few or no voters in them may be used to connect separate regions for inclusion in one district, as is the case in Texas&#x27;s 35th congressional district.

Depending on the distribution of voters for a particular party, metrics that maximize compactness can be opposed to metrics that minimize the efficiency gap. For example, in the United States, voters registered with the Democratic Party tend to be concentrated in cities, potentially resulting in a large number of &quot;wasted&quot; votes if compact districts are drawn around city populations. Neither of these metrics take into consideration other possible goals, such as proportional representation based on other demographic characteristics (such as race, ethnicity, gender, or income), maximizing competitiveness of elections (the greatest number of districts where party affiliation is 50/50), avoiding splits of existing government units (like cities and counties), and ensuring representation of major interest groups (like farmers or voters in a specific transportation corridor), though any of these could be incorporated into a more complicated metric.

====Minimum district to convex polygon ratio====
One method is to define a minimum district to convex polygon ratio. To use this method, every proposed district is circumscribed by the smallest possible convex polygon (its convex hull; think of stretching a rubberband around the outline of the district). Then, the area of the district is divided by the area of the polygon; or, if at the edge of the state, by the portion of the area of the polygon within state boundaries.

The advantages of this method are that it allows a certain amount of human intervention to take place (thus solving the Colorado problem of splitline districting); it allows the borders of the district to follow existing jagged subdivisions, such as neighborhoods or voting districts (something isoperimetric rules would discourage); and it allows concave coastline districts, such as the Florida gulf coast area. It would mostly eliminate bent districts, but still permit long, straight ones. However, since human intervention is still allowed, the gerrymandering issues of packing and cracking would still occur, just to a lesser extent.

====Shortest splitline algorithm====
The Center for Range Voting has proposed a way to draw districts by a simple algorithm. The algorithm uses only the shape of the state, the number of districts wanted, and the population distribution as inputs. The algorithm (slightly simplified) is:

# Start with the boundary outline of the state.
# Let =A+B where is the number of districts to create, and A and B are two whole numbers, either equal (if is even) or differing by exactly one (if is odd). For example, if is 10, each of and would be 5. If is 7, would be 4 and would be 3.
# Among all possible straight lines that split the state into two parts with the population ratio A:B, choose the &quot;shortest&quot;. If there are two or more such shortest lines, choose the one that is most north–south in direction; if there is still more than one possibility, choose the westernmost.
# We now have two hemi-states, each to contain a specified number (namely and ) of districts. Handle them recursively via the same splitting procedure.
# Any human residence that is split in two or more parts by the resulting lines is considered to be a part of the most north-eastern of the resulting districts; if this does not decide it, then of the most northern.

This district-drawing algorithm has the advantages of simplicity, ultra-low cost, a single possible result (thus no possibility of human interference), lack of intentional bias, and it produces simple boundaries that do not meander needlessly. It has the disadvantage of ignoring geographic features such as rivers, cliffs, and highways and cultural features such as tribal boundaries. This landscape oversight causes it to produce districts different from those a human would produce. Ignoring geographic features can induce very simple boundaries.

While most districts produced by the method will be fairly compact and either roughly rectangular or triangular, some of the resulting districts can still be long and narrow strips (or triangles) of land.

Like most automatic redistricting rules, the shortest splitline algorithm will fail to create majority-minority districts, for both ethnic and political minorities, if the minority populations are not very compact. This might reduce minority representation.

Another criticism of the system is that splitline districts sometimes divide and diffuse the voters in a large metropolitan area. This condition is most likely to occur when one of the first splitlines cuts through the metropolitan area. It is often considered a drawback of the system because residents of the same agglomeration are assumed to be a community of common interest. This is most evident in the splitline allocation of Colorado.
However, in cases when the splitline divides a large metropolitan area, it is usually because that large area has enough population for multiple districts. In cases which the large area only has the population for one district, then the splitline usually results in the urban area being in one district with the other district being rural.

As of July 2007, shortest-splitline redistricting pictures, based on the results of the 2000 census, are available for all 50 states.

====Minimum isoperimetric quotient====

It is possible to define a specific minimum isoperimetric quotient, proportional to the ratio between the area and the square of the perimeter of any given congressional voting district. Although technologies presently exist to define districts in this manner, there are no rules in place mandating their use, and no national movement to implement such a policy. One problem with the simplest version of this rule is that it would prevent incorporation of jagged natural boundaries, such as rivers or mountains; when such boundaries are required, such as at the edge of a state, certain districts may not be able to meet the required minima. One way of avoiding this problem is to allow districts which share a border with a state border to replace that border with a polygon or semi-circle enclosing the state boundary as a kind of virtual boundary definition, but using the actual perimeter of the district whenever this occurs inside the state boundaries. Enforcing a minimum isoperimetric quotient would encourage districts with a high ratio between area and perimeter.

====Efficiency gap calculation====

The efficiency gap is a simply-calculable measure that can show the effects of gerrymandering. It measures wasted votes for each party: the sum of votes cast in losing districts (losses due to cracking) and excess votes cast in winning districts (losses due to packing). The difference in these wasted votes are divided by total votes cast, and the resulting percentage is the efficiency gap.

In 2017, Boris Alexeev and Dustin Mixon proved that &quot;sometimes, a small efficiency gap is only possible with bizarrely shaped districts&quot;. This means that it is mathematically impossible to always devise boundaries which would simultaneously meet certain Polsby–Popper and efficiency gap targets,

Given such theoretical difficulties, a robust, however sub-optimal, anti-gerrymandering rule may be as simple as identifying all maps satisfying a rough efficiency measure, like expected outcome matching voter affiliation proportions, then choosing the one most compact.

==Use of databases and computer technology==

The introduction of modern computers alongside the development of elaborate voter databases and special districting software has made gerrymandering a far more precise science. Using such databases, political parties can obtain detailed information about every household including political party registration, previous campaign donations, and the number of times residents voted in previous elections and combine it with other predictors of voting behavior such as age, income, race, or education level. With this data, gerrymandering politicians can predict the voting behavior of each potential district with an astonishing degree of precision, leaving little chance for creating an accidentally competitive district.

On the other hand, the introduction of modern computers would allow the United States Census Bureau to calculate more equal populations in every voting district that are based only on districts being the most compact and equal populations. This could be done easily using their Block Centers based on the Global Positioning System rather than street addresses. With this data, gerrymandering politicians will not be in charge, thus allowing competitive districts again.

Online web apps such as Dave&#x27;s Redistricting have allowed users to simulate redistricting states into legislative districts as they wish. According to Bradlee, the software was designed to &quot;put power in people&#x27;s hands,&quot; and so that they &quot;can see how the process works, so it&#x27;s a little less mysterious than it was 10 years ago.&quot;

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can measure the extent to which redistricting plans favor a particular party or group in election, and can support automated redistricting simulators.

==Voting systems==
===First-past-the-post===
Gerrymandering is most likely to emerge in majoritarian systems, where the country is divided into several voting districts and the candidate with the most votes wins the district. If the ruling party is in charge of drawing the district lines, it can abuse the fact that in a majoritarian system all votes that do not go to the winning candidate are essentially irrelevant to the composition of a new government. Even though gerrymandering can be used in other voting systems, it has the most significant impact on voting outcomes in first-past-the-post systems. Partisan redrawing of district lines is particularly harmful to democratic principles in majoritarian two-party systems. In general, two party systems tend to be more polarized than proportional systems. Possible consequences of gerrymandering in such a system can be an amplification of polarization in politics and a lack of representation of minorities, as a large part of the constituency is not represented in policy making. However, not every state using a first-past-the-post system is being confronted with the negative impacts of gerrymandering. Some countries, such as Canada and the UK, authorize non-partisan organizations to set constituency boundaries in attempt to prevent gerrymandering.

===Proportional systems===

The introduction of a proportional system is often proposed as the most effective solution to partisan gerrymandering. In such systems, the entire constituency is being represented proportionally to their votes. Even though voting districts can be part of a proportional system, the redrawing of district lines would not benefit a party, as those districts are mainly of organizational value, except where the district magnitude is small or a system which favors larger parties, such as d&#x27;Hondt, is used. For example, instead of having three districts, a single large district would exist where the top three candidates in the election would all represent the district. It would be harder to gerrymander a district where there are multiple winners from that district.

===Mixed systems===

In mixed systems that use proportional and majoritarian voting principles, the usage of gerrymandering is a constitutional obstacle that states have to deal with. In mixed systems, the advantage a political actor can potentially gain from redrawing district lines is much less than in majoritarian systems. In addition, voting districts are mostly being used to avoid that elected parliamentarians are getting too detached from their constituency. The principle that determines the representation in parliament is usually the proportional aspect of the voting system. Seats in parliament are being allocated to each party in accordance to the proportion of their overall votes. In most mixed systems, winning a voting district merely means that a candidate is guaranteed a seat in parliament but does not expand a party&#x27;s share in the overall seats. Gerrymandering can still be used to manipulate the outcome in voting districts. In most democracies with a mixed system, non-partisan institutions are in charge of drawing district lines and gerrymandering is a less common phenomenon.

== Difference from malapportionment ==
Gerrymandering in its original sense should not be confused with malapportionment, whereby the number of eligible voters per elected representative can vary widely. In Australia, however, the term was widely used to refer to malapportionment. Moreover, the &quot;-mander&quot; suffix was applied to particular malapportionments, such as the Playmander in South Australia. 

Sometimes political representatives use both gerrymandering and malapportionment to try to maintain power. One of the earliest examples of malapportionment, rotten boroughs, was practiced in England from the 13th century until the 1832 reform act. A striking modern example of malapportionment is the U.S. senate, where states receive equal representation despite widely varying populations.

==Examples==
Several western democracies, notably Israel, the Netherlands and Slovakia employ an electoral system with only one (nationwide) voting district for election of national representatives. This precludes gerrymandering. Other European countries such as Austria, the Czech Republic or Sweden, among many others, have electoral districts with fixed boundaries (usually one district for each administrative division). The number of representatives for each district can change after a census due to population shifts, but their boundaries do not change. This also effectively eliminates gerrymandering.

Additionally, many countries where the president is directly elected by the citizens (e.g. France, Poland, among others) use only one electoral district for their presidential election with the winner of the popular vote winning the position, despite using multiple districts to elect representatives.

===Australia===
====National====
Gerrymandering has not typically been considered a problem in the national Australian electoral system largely because drawing of electoral boundaries has typically been done by non-partisan electoral commissions. There have been historical cases of malapportionment, whereby the distribution of electors to electorates was not in proportion to the population in several states. though most of these have been eliminated over time.

In 1996, the High Court of Australia in &quot;McGinty v Western Australia&quot; confirmed the constitutional legality of electoral systems where different constituencies were differently weighted from others in the same system; in particular, the case approved Western Australia&#x27;s system.

====South Australia====

Sir Thomas Playford was Premier of the state of South Australia from 1938 to 1965 as a result of a system of malapportionment, which became known as the Playmander.

====Queensland====

In the state of Queensland, malapportionment combined with a gerrymander under Country Party Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen (knighted by Queen Elizabeth II at his own request) became nicknamed the Bjelkemander in the 1970s and 1980s.

The malapportionment had been originally designed to favor rural areas in the 1930s-1950s by a Labor government who drew their support from agricultural and mine workers in rural areas. This helped Labor to stay in government from 1932 to 1957. As demographics and political views shifted over time, this system came to favor the Country Party instead.

The Country Party led by Frank Nicklin came to power in 1957, deciding to keep the malapportionment that favored them. In 1968, Joh Bjelke-Petersen became leader of the Country Party and Premier. In the 1970s, he further expanded the malapportionment and gerrymandering which then became known as the &quot;Bjelkemander&quot;. Under the system, electoral boundaries were drawn so that rural electorates had as few as half as many voters as metropolitan ones and regions with high levels of support for the Labor Party were concentrated into fewer electorates, allowing Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s government to remain in power for despite attracting substantially less than 50% of the vote. One district had non-contiguous parts.

In the 1986 election, for example, the National Party received 39.64% of the first preference vote and won 49 seats (in the 89 seat Parliament) whilst the Labor Opposition received 41.35% but won only 30 seats. Bjelke-Petersen also used the system to disadvantage Liberal Party (traditionally allied with the Country Party) voters in urban areas, allowing Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s Country Party to rule alone, shunning the Liberals.

Bjelke-Petersen also used Queensland Police brutality to quell protests, and Queensland under his government was frequently described as a police state. In 1987 he was eventually forced to resign in disgrace after the Fitzgerald Inquiry revealed wide-ranging corruption in his cabinet and the Queensland Police, resulting in the prosecution and jailing of Country Party members. Before resigning, Bjelke-Petersen asked the Governor of Queensland to sack his own cabinet, in an unsuccessful attempt to cling to power. Labor won the next election, and have remained the dominant party in Queensland since then. The Country Party and Liberal Party eventually merged in Queensland to become the Liberal-National Party, while the Country Party in other states was renamed as the National Party.

====Western Australia====
The Western Australian Legislative Council was long gerrymandered via a malapportionment that clearly favored the rural conservative National Party, with the state split into electoral regions with significant differences in voter numbers. After the Labor Party won a landslide victory in both houses in the 2021 Western Australian state election, they abolished the electoral region system, replacing it with a single statewide constituency electing 37 members via optional preferential voting that creates a one-vote, one-value system.

====City of Sydney Council====
In 2014 the conservative Liberal Party NSW State Government gerrymandered the local City of Sydney council elections as part of their continued attempts to remove Clover Moore from elected positions. Moore had already been removed as a state government representative by laws banning serving simultaneously as a state representative and a local council member, and their attempt to remove her from the Council saw the State Government introduce a law giving all businesses in the area two votes and requiring the council to constantly update the electoral roll and inform each business of its eligibility to vote. Moore called the laws an &quot;undemocratic gerrymander&quot; and election analyst Antony Green said the changes were &quot;clearly an attempt to disadvantage Clover Moore&quot;. The laws were specific to the City of Sydney council and not rolled out across the rest of the state councils. The attempt failed, and Moore retained her position as Lord Mayor of Sydney through multiple further elections.

===Bahamas===
The 1962 Bahamian general election was likely influenced by gerrymandering. The election was the first to allow universal suffrage. The Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) received 44% of the vote, while the United Bahamian Party (UBP) won only 36% of the vote. The other 20% was for third parties and independents. Despite receiving a majority of the votes, the PLP won only 8 of the 33 seats in the House of Assembly, while the UBP won 18 seats.

===Canada===
Gerrymandering used to be prominent in Canadian politics, but is no longer prominent, after independent electoral boundary redistribution commissions were established in all provinces. Early in Canadian history, both the federal and provincial levels used gerrymandering to try to maximize partisan power. When Alberta and Saskatchewan were admitted to Confederation in 1905, their original district boundaries were set forth in the respective Alberta and Saskatchewan Acts. Federal Liberal cabinet members devised the boundaries to ensure the election of provincial Liberal governments. British Columbia used a combination of single-member and dual-member constituencies to solidify the power of the center-right British Columbia Social Credit Party until 1991.

Since responsibility for drawing federal and provincial electoral boundaries was handed over to independent agencies, the problem has largely been eliminated at those levels of government. Manitoba was the first province to authorize a non-partisan group to define constituency boundaries in the 1950s. In 1964, the federal government delegated the drawing of boundaries for federal electoral districts to the non-partisan agency Elections Canada which answers to Parliament rather than the government of the day.

As a result, gerrymandering is not generally a major issue in Canada except at the civic level. Although city wards are recommended by independent agencies, city councils occasionally overrule them. That is much more likely if the city is not homogenous and different neighborhoods have sharply different opinions about city policy direction.

In 2006, a controversy arose in Prince Edward Island over the provincial government&#x27;s decision to throw out an electoral map drawn by an independent commission. Instead, they created two new maps. The government adopted the second of them, which was designed by the caucus of the governing Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island. Opposition parties and the media attacked Premier Pat Binns for what they saw as gerrymandering of districts. Among other things, the government adopted a map that ensured that every current Member of the Legislative Assembly from the premier&#x27;s party had a district to run in for re-election, but in the original map, several had been redistricted. However, in the 2007 provincial election only seven of 20 incumbent Members of the Legislative Assembly were re-elected (seven did not run for re-election), and the government was defeated.

===Chile===

The military government which ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990 was ousted in a national plebiscite in October 1988. Opponents of General Augusto Pinochet voted NO to remove him from power and to trigger democratic elections, while supporters (mostly from the right-wing) voted YES to keep him in office for another eight years.

Five months prior to the plebiscite, the regime published a law regulating future elections and referendums, but the configuration of electoral districts and the manner in which National Congress seats would be awarded were only added to the law seven months after the referendum.

For the Chamber of Deputies (lower house), 60 districts were drawn by grouping (mostly) neighboring communes (the smallest administrative subdivision in the country) within the same region (the largest). It was established that two deputies would be elected per district, with the most voted coalition needing to outpoll its closest rival by a margin of more than 2-to-1 to take both seats. The results of the 1988 plebiscite show that neither the &quot;NO&quot; side nor the &quot;YES&quot; side outpolled the other by said margin in any of the newly established districts. They also showed that the vote/seat ratio was lower in districts which supported the &quot;YES&quot; side and higher in those where the &quot;NO&quot; was strongest. In spite of this, at the 1989 parliamentary election, the center-left opposition was able to capture both seats (the so-called &quot;doblaje&quot;) in twelve out of 60 districts, winning control of 60% of the Chamber.

Senate constituencies were created by grouping all lower-chamber districts in a region, or by dividing a region into two constituencies of contiguous lower-chamber districts. The 1980 Constitution allocated a number of seats to appointed senators, making it harder for one side to change the Constitution by itself. The opposition won 22 senate seats in the 1989 election, taking both seats in three out of 19 constituencies, controlling 58% of the elected Senate, but only 47% of the full Senate. The unelected senators were eliminated in the 2005 constitutional reforms, but the electoral map has remained largely untouched (two new regions were created in 2007, one of which altered the composition of two senatorial constituencies; the first election to be affected by this minor change took place in 2013).

===Croatia===
During the process of declaration and recognition of independence of Croatia the administrative divisions of the country was reorganized into 20 newly established counties and the city of Zagreb. All of the counties had Croat ethnic majority and were in part established as a gerrymandering effort to delegitimize Republic of Serbian Krajina secession as well as any regionalist requests in the historic provinces of Istria and Dalmatia while at the same time strengthening dominant-party&#x27;s control over the Chamber of Counties. Following the end of the Croatian War of Independence and during the UNTAES administration in Eastern Slavonia Serb political leader Vojislav Stanimirović accused Croatian authorities of intentional division of the Serb community in the region into Osijek-Baranja and Vukovar-Srijem County with an aim to dilute their political initiatives.

Croatian Parliament electoral districts were also described as a form of gerrymandering preventing genuine political competition with each district selecting the same number of MPs while districts&#x27; population varied over the legally permitted ±5 percent. In 2010 Constitutional Court of Croatia stated in a report that population discrepancies among electoral districts is higher than ±5 percent and that districts&#x27; borders should be redrawn to address the concern. 2021 Croatian census indicated even further differences in population with the difference in needed number of votes in the smallest (Electoral district IV) and the largest (Electoral district VII) district for a single parliamentary mandate being 10,5 thousands votes. In October 2022 President of the Constitutional Court of Croatia Miroslav Šeparović warned that this situation may jeopardize constitutionality of the following elections in Croatia.

===El Salvador===

On 30 December 2022, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele tweeted that he believed that the country&#x27;s 262 municipalities should be reduced to 50. Opposition politicians accused him of attempting to gerrymander the municipalities and consolidate his power ahead of the 2024 general election. On 20 February 2023, Legislative Assembly President Ernesto Castro announced that the Nuevas Ideas (NI) political party was formally evaluating a proposal to reduce the number of municipalities as suggested by Bukele.

===France===
France is one of the few countries to let legislatures redraw the map with no check. In practice, the Parliament of France sets up an executive commission. Districts called &quot;arrondissements&quot; were used in the Third Republic and under the Fifth Republic they are called &quot;circonscriptions&quot;. During the Third Republic, some reforms of arrondissements, which were also used for administrative purposes, were largely suspected to have been arranged to favor the kingmaker in the National Assembly, the Radical Party.

The dissolution of Seine and Seine-et-Oise départements by de Gaulle was seen as a case of gerrymandering to counter communist influence around Paris.

In the modern regime, there were three designs: in 1958 (regime change), 1987 (by Charles Pasqua) and 2010 (by Alain Marleix), three times by conservative governments. Pasqua&#x27;s drawing was known to have been particularly good at gerrymandering, resulting in 80% of the seats with 58% of the vote in 1993, and forcing Socialists in the 1997 snap election to enact multiple pacts with smaller parties in order to win again, this time as a coalition. In 2010, the Sarkozy government created 12 districts for expats.

The Constitutional council was called twice by the opposition to decide about gerrymandering, but it never considered partisan disproportions. However, it forced the Marleix committee to respect an 80–120% population ratio, ending a tradition dating back to the Revolution in which &quot;départements&quot;, however small in population, would send at least two MPs.
The constituencies in New Caledonia are accused of being adjusted to ensure a loyalist win. The 1st constituency combines the Loyalty Islands (a separatist province) with the capital Noumea, while the 2nd constituency combines the rural separatist-dominated North Province with most of the South Province. There had been no separatist deputy from the 1986 to the 2024 election with the victory of Emmanuel Tjibaou.

===Germany===

Since Germany utilizes a proportional representation system, gerrymandering is rarely a problem. There is, however, one situation in which gerrymandering can affect an election. In Germany for a party to win any seat, it has to win at least 5% of the vote or three constituencies. This latter rule was applied most recently in the 2021 federal election, in which the Left entered the Bundestag despite winning less than 5% of the vote.

In 2000 the electoral constituencies were redrawn and the PDS, which entered the Bundestag in the elections of 1994 and 1998 with this rule, accused the SPD, who were in power at the time of redrawing the constituencies, of gerrymandering them by breaking up districts in East Berlin, a PDS stronghold, and combining them with West Berlin. In the 2002 federal election the PDS lost their third constituency and entered the Bundestag with only two seats. Had they won a third direct seat, they would have qualified for an additional 25 seats.

Another scenario in which gerrymandering can affect German federal election is when a party wins more constituenies than their overall share of the popular vote—those extra seats, called &quot;Überhangmandate&quot;, remain. In the Bundestag election of 2009, Angela Merkel&#x27;s CDU/CSU gained 24 such extra seats, while no other party gained any; this skewed the result so much that the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany issued two rulings declaring the existing election laws invalid and requiring the Bundestag to pass a new law limiting such extra seats to no more than 15. In 2013, Germany&#x27;s Federal Constitutional Court ruled on the constitutionality of Überhangmandate. From then on each other party would receive seats as well to remedy the disproportion, thereby making it impossible to have disproportionate election results.

===Greece===

Gerrymandering has been rather common in Greek history since organized parties with national ballots only appeared after the 1926 Constitution. The only case before that was the creation of the Piraeus electoral district in 1906, in order to give the Theotokis party a safe district.

A notable case of gerrymandering in Greece was in the 1956 legislative election. While in previous elections the districts were based on the prefecture level (νομός), for 1956 the country was split in districts of varying sizes, some being the size of prefectures, some the size of sub-prefectures (επαρχία) and others somewhere in between. In small districts the winning party would take all seats, in intermediate size, it would take most and there was proportional representation in the largest districts. The districts were created in such a way that small districts were those that traditionally voted for the right while large districts were those that voted against the right.

This system has become known as the three-phase (τριφασικό) system or the baklava system (because, as baklava is split into full pieces and corner pieces, the country was also split into disproportionate pieces). The opposition, being composed of the center and the left, formed a coalition with the sole intent of changing the electoral law and then calling new elections. Even though the centrist and leftist opposition won the popular vote (1,620,007 votes against 1,594,992), the right-wing ERE won the majority of seats (165 to 135) and was to lead the country for the next two years.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, functional constituencies are demarcated by the government and defined in statutes, making them prone to gerrymandering. The functional constituency for the information technology sector was particular criticized for gerrymandering and voteplanting.

There are also gerrymandering concerns in the constituencies of district councils.

===Hungary===
In 2011, Fidesz politician János Lázár has proposed a redesign to Hungarian voting districts; considering the territorial results of previous elections, this redesign would favor right-wing politics according to the opposition. Since then, the law has been passed by the Fidesz-majority National Assembly. By the political think tanks and media close to the opposition, it took twice as many votes to gain a seat in some election districts as in some others. However, their findings are controversial. Gerrymandering was seen in the 2018 election results.

===Ireland===
Until the 1980s Dáil boundaries in Ireland were drawn not by an independent commission but by government ministers. Successive arrangements by governments of all political characters have been attacked as gerrymandering. Ireland uses the single transferable vote, and as well as the actual boundaries drawn, the main tool of gerrymandering has been the number of seats per constituency used, with three-seat constituencies normally benefiting the strongest parties in an area, whereas four-seat constituencies normally help smaller parties.

In 1947 the rapid rise of new party Clann na Poblachta threatened the position of the governing party Fianna Fáil. The government of Éamon de Valera introduced the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1947, which increased the size of the Dáil from 138 to 147 and increased the number of three-seat constituencies from fifteen to twenty-two. The result was described by the journalist and historian Tim Pat Coogan as &quot;a blatant attempt at gerrymander which no Six County Unionist could have bettered.&quot; The following February the 1948 general election was held and Clann na Poblachta secured ten seats instead of the nineteen they would have received proportional to their vote.

In the mid-1970s, the Minister for Local Government, James Tully, attempted to arrange the constituencies to ensure that the governing Fine Gael–Labour Party National Coalition would win a parliamentary majority. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 1974 was planned as a major reversal of previous gerrymandering by Fianna Fáil (then in opposition). Tully ensured that there were as many as possible three-seat constituencies where the governing parties were strong, in the expectation that the governing parties would each win a seat in many constituencies, relegating Fianna Fáil to one out of three.

In areas where the governing parties were weak, four-seat constituencies were used so that the governing parties had a strong chance of still winning two. The election results created substantial change, as there was a larger than expected collapse in the vote. Fianna Fáil won a landslide victory in the 1977 Irish general election, two out of three seats in many cases, relegating the National Coalition parties to fight for the last seat. Consequently, the term &quot;Tullymandering&quot; was used to describe the phenomenon of a failed attempt at gerrymandering.

===India===
Gerrymandering in India is loosely claimed by many political analysts, however there is no conclusive evidence whether the exercise has benefited a particular political party or not. The last nationwide delimitation was done in 2009 and two successive elections threw two different results giving mandate to both the political parties one after another.

===Italy===
A hypothesis of gerrymandering was theorized by constituencies drawn by the electoral act of 2017, so-called Rosatellum.

===Kuwait===
From the years 1981 until 2005, Kuwait was divided into 25 electoral districts in order to over-represent the government&#x27;s supporters (the &#x27;tribes&#x27;). In July 2005, a new law for electoral reforms was approved which prevented electoral gerrymandering by cutting the number of electoral districts from 25 to 5. 
The government of Kuwait found that 5 electoral districts resulted in a powerful parliament with the majority representing the opposition. A new law was crafted by the government of Kuwait and signed by the Amir to gerrymander the districts to 10 allowing the government&#x27;s supporters to regain the majority.

===Lithuania===

For the 2024 Lithuanian parliamentary election, the electoral districts were redrawn. 10 elderships of the Vilnius District Municipality which has a large Polish minority were merged with elderships of Vilnius to form the new Southern Vilnius district thus extending the total count of districts in Vilnius from 13 to 14. The LLRA–KŠS criticized the decision to rather choose Polish-dominated towns like Juodšiliai and Valčiūnai over Lithuanian-dominated towns like Riešė and Avižieniai to merge with Vilnius.

Riešė and Avižieniai remain in the Riešė district (previously known as Nemenčinė district) even though its predecessor was considered &quot;way too large&quot;.

===Malaysia===

The practice of gerrymandering has been around in the country since its independence in 1957. The ruling coalition at that time, &quot;Barisan Nasional&quot; (BN; English: &quot;National Front&quot;), has been accused of controlling the election commission by revising the boundaries of constituencies. For example, during the 13th General Election in 2013, Barisan Nasional won 60% of the seats in the Malaysian Parliament despite only receiving 47% of the popular vote. Malapportionment has also been used at least since 1974, when it was observed that in one state alone (Perak), the parliamentary constituency with the most voters had more than ten times as many voters as the one with the fewest voters. These practices finally failed BN in the 14th General Election on 9 May 2018, when the opposing &quot;Pakatan Harapan&quot; (PH; English: &quot;Alliance of Hope&quot;) won despite perceived efforts of gerrymandering and malapportionment from the incumbent.

===Malta===
The Labour Party that won in 1981, even though the Nationalist Party got the most votes, did so because of its gerrymandering. A 1987 constitutional amendment awarding compensatory seats to make the final seat tally closer reflect actual vote share prevented that situation from reoccurring.

===Nepal===
After the restoration of democracy in 1990, Nepali politics has well exercised the practice of gerrymandering with the view to take advantage in the election. It was often practiced by Nepali Congress, which remained in power in most of the time. Learning from this, the reshaping of constituency was done for constituent assembly and the opposition now wins elections.

In 2015, the government rewrote the Constitution of Nepal, which included a rewriting of electoral boundaries. Parties in the southern region of Terai believe the new boundaries discriminated against marginalized groups, like the Madhesis, Tharus, and Janajatis, and that the boundaries &quot;packed&quot; the groups. Protesting occurred in Terai and other areas in southern Nepal, raising concern from across the country.

===Philippines===
Congressional districts in the Philippines were originally based on an ordinance from the 1987 Constitution, which was created by the Constitutional Commission, which was ultimately based on legislative districts as they were drawn in 1907. The same constitution gave Congress of the Philippines the power to legislate new districts, either through a national redistricting bill or piecemeal redistricting per province or city. Congress has never passed a national redistricting bill since the approval of the 1987 constitution, while it has incrementally created 34 new districts, out of the 200 originally created in 1987.

This allows Congress to create new districts once a place reaches 250,000 inhabitants, the minimum required for its creation. With this, local dynasties, through congressmen, can exert influence in the district-making process by creating bills carving new districts from old ones. In time, as the population of the Philippines increases, these districts, or groups of it, will be the basis of carving new provinces out of existing ones.

An example was in Camarines Sur, where two districts were divided into three districts which allegedly favors the Andaya and the Arroyo families; it caused Rolando Andaya and Dato Arroyo, who would have otherwise run against each other, run in separate districts, with one district allegedly not even surpassing the 250,000-population minimum. The Supreme Court later ruled that the 250,000 population minimum does not apply to an additional district in a province. The resulting splits would later be the cause of another gerrymander, where the province would be split into a new province called Nueva Camarines; the bill was defeated in the Senate in 2013.

===Singapore===
In recent decades, critics have accused the ruling People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) of unfair electoral practices to maintain significant majorities in the Parliament of Singapore. Among the complaints are that the government uses gerrymandering. The Elections Department was established as part of the executive branch under the Prime Minister of Singapore, rather than as an independent body. Critics have accused it of giving the ruling party the power to decide polling districts and polling sites through electoral engineering, based on poll results in previous elections.

Members of opposition parties claim that the Group Representation Constituency system is &quot;synonymous to gerrymandering&quot;, pointing out examples of Cheng San GRC and Eunos GRC which were dissolved by the Elections Department with voters redistributed to other constituencies after opposition parties gained ground in elections.

=== South Africa ===
The landmark 1948 general election was influenced by provisions of the Constitution granting rural areas more constituencies in Parliament than urban areas. Thus the white-supremacist National Party won a plurality against the more moderate United Party despite receiving fewer votes and implemented apartheid.

=== Spain ===

Until the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931, Spain used both single-member and multi-member constituencies in general elections. Multi-member constituencies were only used in some big cities. Some gerrymandering examples included the districts of Vilademuls or Torroella de Montgrí in Catalonia. These districts were created in order to prevent the Federal Democratic Republican Party to win a seat in Figueres or La Bisbal and to secure a seat to the dynastic parties. Since 1931, the constituency boundaries match the province boundaries.

After the Francoist dictatorship, during the transition to democracy, these fixed provincial constituencies were reestablished in Section 68.2 of the current 1978 Spanish Constitution, so gerrymandering is impossible in general elections. There are not &quot;winner-takes-all&quot; elections in Spain except for the tiny territories of Ceuta and Melilla (which only have one representative each); everywhere else the number of representatives assigned to a constituency is proportional to its population and calculated according to a national law, so tampering with under- or over-representation is difficult too.

European, some regional and municipal elections are held under single, at-large multi-member constituencies with proportional representation and gerrymandering is not possible either.

In fact, there is not even a direct translation of the term &quot;gerrymandering&quot; into Spanish and first-generation Hispanic and Latino Americans have struggled with such an unfamiliar concept in the Spanish-speaking world.

=== Sri Lanka ===
Sri Lanka&#x27;s new Local Government elections process has been the talking point of gerrymandering since its inception. Even though that talk was more about the ward-level, it is also seen in some local council areas too.

===Sudan===
In the election of 2010, there were numerous examples of gerrymandering throughout the entire country of Sudan. A report from the Rift Valley Institute uncovered violations of Sudan&#x27;s electoral law, where constituencies were created that were well below and above the required limit. According to Sudan&#x27;s National Elections Act of 2008, no constituency can have a population that is 15% greater or less than the average constituency size. The Rift Valley Report uncovered a number of constituencies that are in violation of this rule. Examples include constituencies in Jonglei, Warrap, South Darfur, and several other states.

===Turkey===
Turkey has used gerrymandering in the city of Istanbul in the 2009 municipal elections. Just before the election Istanbul was divided into new districts. Large low income neighborhoods were bundled with the rich neighborhoods to enable the AKP to win the municipal elections.

===United Kingdom===

====Northern Ireland====
=====Parliamentary Elections=====
Prior to the establishment of Home Rule in Northern Ireland, the UK government had installed the single transferable vote (STV) system in Ireland to secure fair elections in terms of proportional representation in its Parliaments. After two elections under that system, in 1929 Stormont changed the electoral system to be the same as the rest of the United Kingdom: a single-member first past the post system. The only exception was for the election of four Stormont MPs to represent the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast. Some believe that the boundaries were gerrymandered to under-represent Nationalists. Other geographers and historians, for instance Professor John H. Whyte, disagree. They have argued that the electoral boundaries for the Parliament of Northern Ireland were not gerrymandered to a greater level than that produced by any single-winner election system, and that the actual number of Nationalist MPs barely changed under the revised system (it went from 12 to 11 and later went back up to 12). Most observers have acknowledged that the change to a single-winner system was a key factor, however, in stifling the growth of smaller political parties, such as the Northern Ireland Labour Party and Independent Unionists. In the 1967 election, Unionists won 35.5% of the votes and received 60% of the seats, while Nationalists got 27.4% of the votes but received 40% of the seats. This meant that both the Unionist and Nationalist parties were over-represented, while the Northern Ireland Labour Party and Independents (amounting to more than 35% of the votes cast) were severely under-represented.

After Westminster reintroduced direct rule in 1973, it restored the single transferable vote (STV) for elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly in the following year, using the same definitions of constituencies as for the Westminster Parliament. Currently, in Northern Ireland, all elections use STV except those for positions in the Westminster Parliament, which follow the pattern in the rest of the United Kingdom by using &quot;first past the post.&quot;

=====Local authority elections=====

Gerrymandering (in ) in local elections was introduced in 1923 by the Leech Commission. This was a one-man commission: Sir John Leech, K.C. was appointed by Dawson Bates, Northern Ireland&#x27;s Minister of Home Affairs, to redraw Northern Ireland&#x27;s local government electoral boundaries. Leech was also chairman of the Advisory Committee who recommended the release or continued detention of the persons that the Northern Irish government was interning without trial at that time. Leech&#x27;s changes (gerrymandered electoral boundaries, abolishing proportional representation), together with a resultant boycott by the Irish Nationalist community, resulted in Unionists gaining control of Londonderry County Borough Council, Fermanagh and Tyrone County Councils, and retaking eight rural district councils. These county councils, and most of the district councils, remained under Unionist control despite the majority of their population being Catholic until the UK government imposed Direct Rule in 1972.

Leech&#x27;s new electoral boundaries for the 1924 Londonderry County Borough Council election reduced the number of wards from four to three, only one of which had a Nationalist majority. This resulted in election of a Unionist council in every election, until the County Borough Council&#x27;s replacement in 1969 by the unelected Londonderry Development Commission, in a city where Nationalists had a large majority and had won previous elections.

Some critics and supporters spoke at the time of &quot;A Protestant Parliament for a Protestant People&quot;. This passed also into local government, where supporters of the elected majorities were given jobs and appointments. Stephen Gwynn noted as early as 1911 that since the introduction of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898:

In Armagh there are 68,000 Protestants, 56,000 Catholics. The County Council has twenty-two Protestants and eight Catholics. In Tyrone, Catholics are a majority of the population, 82,000 against 68,000; but the electoral districts have been so arranged that Unionists return sixteen as against thirteen Nationalists (one a Protestant). This Council gives to the Unionists two to one majority on its Committees, and out of fifty-two officials employs only five Catholics. In Antrim, which has the largest Protestant majority (196,000 to 40,000), twenty-six Unionists and three Catholics are returned. Sixty officers out of sixty-five are good Unionists and Protestants.

Initially Leech drew the boundaries, but from the 1920s to the 1940s the province-wide government redrew them to reinforce the gerrymander.

Cahir Healy, the long time MP for Counties Fermanagh and Tyrone highlighted the extent of gerrymandering in County Borough Councils elections of the 1930s: Fermanagh reported 30,196 Nationalists and 24,272 Unionists yet Nationalists retained only seven seats while Unionists retained 12. Similar results occurred in County Tyrone: 70,595 Nationalists retained 11 seats while 56,981 Unionists held 16 seats.

====United Kingdom – Boundary review====
The number of electors in a United Kingdom constituency can vary considerably, with the smallest constituency as of 2017 (Scotland&#x27;s Na h-Eileanan an Iar (21,769 constituents) and Orkney and Shetland (34,552)) having fewer than a fifth of the electors of the largest (England&#x27;s North West Cambridgeshire (93,223) and Isle of Wight (110,697)). This variation has resulted from:

*Scotland and Wales being favored in the Westminster Parliament with deliberately smaller electoral quotas (average electors per constituency) than those in England and Northern Ireland. This inequality was initiated by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1958, which eliminated the previous common electoral quota for the whole United Kingdom and replaced it with four separate national quotas for the respective Boundaries commissions to work to: England 69,534; Northern Ireland 67,145; Wales 58,383; and Scotland 54,741.
* Current rules historically favoring geographically &quot;natural&quot; constituencies such as islands, which continue to give Wales and Scotland proportionally greater representation.
* Population migrations, due to white flight and deindustrialization tending to decrease the number of electors in inner-city districts.

Under the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the Coalition government planned to review and redraw the parliamentary constituency boundaries for the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The review and redistricting was to be carried out by the four UK boundary commissions to produce a reduction from 650 to 600 seats, and more uniform sizes, such that a constituency was to have no fewer than 70,583 and no more than 80,473 electors. The process was intended to address historic malapportionment and be complete by 2015. Preliminary reports suggesting the areas set to lose the fewest seats historically tended to vote Conservative, while other less populous and deindustrialized regions, such as Wales, which would lose a larger proportion of its seats, tending to have more Labour and Liberal Democrat voters, partially correcting the existing malapportionment. In January 2013, an opposition (Labour) motion to suspend the review until after the next general election was tabled in the House of Lords and a vote called in the United Kingdom House of Commons. The motion was passed with the help of the Liberal Democrats, going back on an election pledge. , a new review is in progress and a draft of the new boundaries has been published.

===United States===


The United States, among the first countries with an elected representative government, was the source of the term &quot;gerrymander&quot; as stated above.

The practice of gerrymandering the borders of new states continued past the American Civil War and into the late 19th century. The Republican Party used its control of Congress to secure the admission of more states in territories friendly to their party—the admission of Dakota Territory as two states instead of one being a notable example. By the rules for representation in the Electoral College, each new state carried at least three electoral votes regardless of its population.

All redistricting in the United States has been contentious because it has been controlled by political parties vying for power. As a consequence of the decennial census required by the United States Constitution, districts for members of the House of Representatives typically need to be redrawn whenever the number of members in a state changes. In many states, state legislatures redraw boundaries for state legislative districts at the same time.

State legislatures have used gerrymandering along racial lines both to decrease and increase minority representation in state governments and congressional delegations. In Ohio, a conversation between Republican officials was recorded that demonstrated that redistricting was being done to aid their political candidates. Furthermore, the discussions assessed the race of voters as a factor in redistricting, on the premise that African-Americans tend to back Democratic Party candidates. Republicans removed approximately 13,000 African-American voters from the district of Jim Raussen, a Republican candidate for the House of Representatives, in an apparent attempt to tip the scales in what was once a competitive district for Democratic candidates.

With the civil rights movement and passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, federal enforcement and protections of suffrage for all citizens were enacted. Gerrymandering for the purpose of reducing the political influence of a racial or ethnic minority group was prohibited. After the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed, some states created &quot;majority-minority&quot; districts to enhance minority voting strength. This practice, also called &quot;affirmative gerrymandering&quot;, was supposed to redress historic discrimination and ensure that ethnic minorities would gain some seats and representation in government. In some states, bipartisan gerrymandering is the norm. State legislators from both parties sometimes agree to draw congressional district boundaries in a way that ensures the re-election of most or all incumbent representatives from both parties.

Rather than allowing more political influence, some states have shifted redistricting authority from politicians and given it to non-partisan redistricting commissions. The states of Washington, Arizona, and California have created standing committees for redistricting following the 2010 census. It has been argued however that in California&#x27;s case, gerrymandering still continued despite this change. Rhode Island and New Jersey have developed &quot;ad hoc&quot; committees, but developed the past two decennial reapportionments tied to new census data. Florida&#x27;s amendments 5 and 6, meanwhile, established rules for the creation of districts but did not mandate an independent commission.

Michigan voters in 2018 approved a proposal to create an independent commission to draw new congressional maps following the 2020 United States census, thereby removing the responsibility from the state legislature. Additionally, Ohio voters in 2018 modified their existing redistricting statutes to have a commission draw new maps. However, the ability of the state legislature to draw congressional maps remained, and this proposes the risk of gerrymandering. Other states that have implemented commissions in the 2018 midterm cycle include Colorado.

International election observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, who were invited to observe and report on the 2004 national elections, expressed criticism of the U.S. congressional redistricting process and made a recommendation that the procedures be reviewed to ensure genuine competitiveness of Congressional election contests.

In June 2019, the United States Supreme Court ruled 5–4 in &quot;Lamone v. Benisek&quot; and &quot;Rucho v. Common Cause&quot; that federal courts lacked jurisdiction to hear challenges over partisan gerrymandering.

===Venezuela===
Prior to the 26 September 2010 legislative elections, gerrymandering took place via an addendum to the electoral law by the National Assembly of Venezuela. In the subsequent election, Hugo Chávez&#x27;s political party, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela drew 48% of the votes overall, while the opposition parties (the Democratic Unity Roundtable and the Fatherland for All parties) collectively drew 52% of the votes. However, due to the re-allocation of electoral legislative districts prior to the election, Chávez&#x27;s United Socialist Party of Venezuela was awarded over 60% of the spots in the National Assembly (98 deputies), while 67 deputies were elected for the two opposition parties combined.

<text>Gin () is a distilled alcoholic drink flavoured with juniper berries and other botanical ingredients.

Gin originated as a medicinal liquor made by monks and alchemists across Europe. The modern gin was modified in Flanders and the Netherlands to provide aqua vita from distillates of grapes and grains, becoming an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin became popular in England after the introduction of jenever, a Dutch and Belgian liquor. Although this development had been taking place since the early 17th century, gin became widespread after the 1688 Glorious Revolution led by William of Orange and subsequent import restrictions on French brandy. Gin emerged as the national alcoholic drink of England during the so-called Gin Craze of 1695–1735.

Gin is produced from a wide range of herbal ingredients in a number of distinct styles and brands. After juniper, gin tends to be flavoured with herbs, spices, floral or fruit flavours, or often a combination. It is commonly mixed with tonic water in a gin and tonic. Gin is also used as a base spirit to produce flavoured, gin-based liqueurs, for example sloe gin, traditionally produced by the addition of fruit, flavourings and sugar.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;gin&quot; is a shortened form of the older English word &quot;genever&quot;, related to the French word and the Dutch word . All ultimately derive from , the Latin for juniper.

==History==
===Origin: 13th-century mentions===
The earliest known written reference to jenever appears in the 13th-century encyclopaedic work (Bruges), with the earliest printed recipe for jenever dating from 16th-century work (Antwerp).

The monks used it to distill sharp, fiery, alcoholic tonics, one of which was distilled from wine infused with juniper berries. They were making medicines, hence the juniper. As a medicinal herb, juniper had been an essential part of doctors&#x27; kits for centuries; plague doctors stuffed the beaks of their plague masks with juniper to supposedly protect them from the Black Death. Across Europe, apothecaries handed out juniper tonic wines for coughs, colds, pains, strains, ruptures and cramps. These were a popular cure-all, though some thought these tonic wines to be a little too popular, and consumed for enjoyment rather than medicinal purposes.

===17th century===
The physician Franciscus Sylvius has been falsely credited with the invention of gin in the mid-17th century, as the existence of jenever is confirmed in Philip Massinger&#x27;s play &quot;The Duke of Milan&quot; (1623), when Sylvius would have been about nine years old. It is further claimed that English soldiers who provided support in Antwerp against the Spanish in 1585, during the Eighty Years&#x27; War, were already drinking jenever for its calming effects before battle, from which the term &quot;Dutch courage&quot; is believed to have originated.

By the mid-17th century, numerous small Dutch and Flemish distillers had popularized the re-distillation of malted barley spirit or malt wine with juniper, also anise, caraway, coriander, etc., which were sold in pharmacies and used to treat such medical problems as kidney ailments, lumbago, stomach ailments, gallstones, and gout. Gin emerged in England in varying forms by the early 17th century, and at the time of the Stuart Restoration, enjoyed a brief resurgence. Gin became vastly more popular as an alternative to brandy, when William III and Mary II became co-sovereigns of England, Scotland and Ireland after leading the Glorious Revolution. Particularly in crude, inferior forms, it was more likely to be flavoured with turpentine. Historian Angela McShane has described it as a &quot;Protestant drink&quot; as its rise was brought about by a Protestant king, fuelling his armies fighting the Catholic Irish and French.

===18th century===
Gin drinking in England rose significantly after the government allowed unlicensed gin production, and at the same time imposed a heavy duty on all imported spirits such as French brandy. This created a larger market for poor-quality barley that was unfit for brewing beer, and in 1695–1735 thousands of gin-shops sprang up throughout England, a period known as the Gin Craze. Because of the low price of gin compared with other drinks available at the time and in the same location, gin began to be consumed regularly by the poor. Of the 15,000 drinking establishments in London, not including coffee shops and drinking chocolate shops, over half were gin shops. Beer maintained a healthy reputation as it was often safer to drink the brewed ale than unclean plain water. Gin, though, was blamed for various social problems, and it may have been a factor in the higher death rates which stabilized London&#x27;s previously growing population. The reputation of the two drinks was illustrated by William Hogarth in his engravings &quot;Beer Street and Gin Lane&quot; (1751), described by the BBC as &quot;arguably the most potent anti-drug poster ever conceived&quot;. The negative reputation of gin survives in the English language in terms like &quot;gin mills&quot; or the American phrase &quot;gin joints&quot; to describe disreputable bars, or &quot;gin-soaked&quot; to refer to drunks. The epithet &quot;mother&#x27;s ruin&quot; is a common British name for gin, the origin of which is debated.

The Gin Act 1736 imposed high taxes on retailers and led to riots in the streets. The prohibitive duty was gradually reduced and finally abolished in 1742. The Gin Act 1751 was more successful, but it forced distillers to sell only to licensed retailers and brought gin shops under the jurisdiction of local magistrates. Gin in the 18th century was produced in pot stills, and thus had a maltier profile than modern London gin.

In London in the early 18th century, much gin was distilled legally in residential houses (there were estimated to be 1,500 residential stills in 1726) and was often flavoured with turpentine to generate resinous woody notes in addition to the juniper. As late as 1913, &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; states without further comment, &quot;&#x27;common gin&#x27; is usually flavoured with turpentine&quot;.

Another common variation was to distill in the presence of sulfuric acid. Although the acid itself does not distil, it imparts the additional aroma of diethyl ether to the resulting gin. Sulfuric acid subtracts one water molecule from two ethanol molecules to create diethyl ether, which also forms an azeotrope with ethanol, and therefore distils with it. The result is a sweeter spirit, and one that may have possessed additional analgesic or even intoxicating effects – see Paracelsus.

Dutch or Belgian gin, also known as &quot;jenever&quot; or &quot;genever&quot;, evolved from malt wine spirits, and is a distinctly different drink from later styles of gin. Schiedam, a city in the province of South Holland, is famous for its &quot;jenever&quot;-producing history. The same for Hasselt in the Belgian province of Limburg. The &quot;oude&quot; (old) style of &quot;jenever&quot; remained very popular throughout the 19th century, where it was referred to as &quot;Holland&quot; or &quot;Geneva&quot; gin in popular, American, pre-Prohibition bartender guides.

The 18th century gave rise to a style of gin referred to as &quot;Old Tom gin&quot;, which is a softer, sweeter style of gin, often containing sugar. Old Tom gin faded in popularity by the early 20th century.

===19th–20th centuries===

The invention and development of the column still (1826 and 1831) made the distillation of neutral spirits practical, thus enabling the creation of the &quot;London dry&quot; style that evolved later in the 19th century.
In tropical British colonies gin was used to mask the bitter flavour of quinine, which was the only effective anti-malarial compound. Quinine was dissolved in carbonated water to form tonic water; the resulting cocktail is gin and tonic, although modern tonic water contains only a trace of quinine as a flavouring. Gin is a common base spirit for many mixed drinks, including the martini. Secretly produced &quot;bathtub gin&quot; was available in the speakeasies and &quot;blind pigs&quot; of Prohibition-era America as a result of the relatively simple production.

Sloe gin is traditionally described as a liqueur made by infusing sloes (the fruit of the blackthorn) in gin, although modern versions are almost always compounded from neutral spirits and flavourings. Similar infusions are possible with other fruits, such as damsons. Another popular gin-based liqueur with a longstanding history is Pimm&#x27;s No.1 Cup (25% alcohol by volume (ABV)), which is a fruit cup flavoured with citrus and spices.

The National Jenever Museums are located in Hasselt in Belgium, and Schiedam in the Netherlands.

===21st century===

Since 2013, gin has been in a period of ascendancy worldwide, with many new brands and producers entering the category leading to a period of strong growth, innovation and change. More recently gin-based liqueurs have been popularised, reaching a market outside that of traditional gin drinkers, including fruit-flavoured and usually coloured &quot;Pink gin&quot;, rhubarb gin, Spiced gin, violet gin, blood orange gin and sloe gin. Surging popularity and unchecked competition has led to consumer&#x27;s conflation of gin with gin liqueurs and many products are straddling, pushing or breaking the boundaries of established definitions in a period of genesis for the industry.

==Legal definition==

===Geographical indication ===
Some legal classifications (protected denomination of origin) define gin as only originating from specific geographical areas without any further restrictions (e.g. Plymouth gin (PGI now lapsed), Ostfriesischer Korngenever, Slovenská borovička, Kraški Brinjevec, etc.), while other common descriptors refer to classic styles that are culturally recognised, but not legally defined (e.g. Old Tom gin). Sloe gin is also worth mentioning, as although technically a gin-based liqueur, it is unique in that the EU spirit drink regulations stipulate the colloquial term &quot;sloe gin&quot; can legally be used without the &quot;liqueur&quot; suffix when certain production criteria are met.

===Canada ===

According to the Canadian Food and Drug Regulation, gin is produced through redistillation of alcohol from juniper berries or a mixture of more than one such redistilled food products. The Canadian Food and Drug Regulation recognises gin with three different definitions (Genever, Gin, London or Dry gin) that loosely approximate the US definitions. Whereas a more detailed regulation is provided for Holland gin or genever, no distinction is made between compounded gin and distilled gin. Either compounded or distilled gin can be labelled as Dry Gin or London Dry Gin if it does not contain any sweetening agents. For Genever and Gin, they shall not contain more than two percent sweetening agents.

=== European Union ===

Although many different styles of gin have evolved, it is legally differentiated into four categories in the European Union, as follows.

==== Juniper-flavoured spirit drink ====

Juniper-flavoured spirit drinks include the earliest class of gin, which is produced by pot distilling a fermented grain mash to moderate strength, &quot;e.g.&quot;, 68% ABV, and then redistilling it with botanicals to extract the aromatic compounds. It must be bottled at a minimum of 30% ABV. Juniper-flavoured spirit-drinks may also be sold under the names Wacholder or Ginebra.

==== Gin ====

Gin is a juniper-flavoured spirit made not via the redistillation of botanicals, but by simply adding approved natural flavouring substances to a neutral spirit of agricultural origin. The predominant flavour must be juniper. Minimum bottled strength is 37.5% ABV.

==== Distilled gin ====

Distilled gin is produced exclusively by redistilling ethanol of agricultural origin with an initial strength of 96% ABV (the azeotrope of water and ethanol), in the presence of juniper berries and of other natural botanicals, provided that the juniper taste is predominant. Gin obtained simply by adding essences or flavourings to ethanol of agricultural origin is not distilled gin. Minimum bottled strength is 37.5% ABV.

==== London gin ====

London gin is obtained exclusively from ethanol of agricultural origin with a maximum methanol content of per hectolitre of 100% ABV equivalent, whose flavour is introduced exclusively through the re-distillation in traditional stills of ethanol in the presence of all the natural plant materials used, the resultant distillate of which is at least 70% ABV. London gin may not contain added sweetening exceeding of sugars per litre of the final product, nor colourants, nor any added ingredients other than water. The predominant flavour must be juniper. The term &quot;London gin&quot; may be supplemented by the term &quot;dry&quot;. Minimum bottled strength is 37.5% ABV.

Although London gin is the strictest of distilled gin categories, it is not a geographical designation.

===United States===

In the United States of America, &quot;gin&quot; is defined as an alcoholic beverage of no less than 40% ABV (80 proof) that possesses the characteristic flavour of juniper berries. Gin produced only through the redistillation of botanicals can be further distinguished and marketed as &quot;distilled gin&quot;.

==Production ==

===Methods===

Gin can be broadly differentiated into three basic styles reflecting modernization in its distillation and flavouring techniques:

Pot distilled gin represents the earliest style of gin, and is traditionally produced by pot distilling a fermented grain mash (malt wine) from barley or other grains, then redistilling it with flavouring botanicals to extract the aromatic compounds. A &quot;double gin&quot; can be produced by redistilling the first gin again with more botanicals. Due to the use of pot stills, the alcohol content of the distillate is relatively low; around 68% ABV for a single distilled gin or 76% ABV for a double gin. This type of gin is often aged in tanks or wooden casks, and retains a heavier, malty flavour that gives it a marked resemblance to whisky. &quot;Korenwijn&quot; (grain wine) and the &quot;oude&quot; (old) style of &quot;Geneva gin&quot; or &quot;Holland gin&quot; represent the most prominent gins of this class.

Column distilled gin evolved following the invention of the Coffey still, and is produced by first distilling high proof (e.g. 96% ABV) neutral spirits from a fermented mash or wash using a refluxing still such as a column still. The fermentable base for this spirit may be derived from grain, sugar beets, grapes, potatoes, sugar cane, plain sugar, or any other material of agricultural origin. The highly concentrated spirit is then redistilled with juniper berries and other botanicals in a pot still. Most often, the botanicals are suspended in a &quot;gin basket&quot; positioned within the head of the still, which allows the hot alcoholic vapours to extract flavouring components from the botanical charge. This method yields a gin lighter in flavour than the older pot still method, and results in either a &quot;distilled gin&quot; or &quot;London dry gin&quot;, depending largely upon how the spirit is finished.

Compound gin is made by compounding (blending) neutral spirits with essences, other natural flavourings, or ingredients left to infuse in neutral spirit without redistillation.

=== Flavouring ===

Popular botanicals or flavouring agents for gin, besides the required juniper, often include citrus elements, such as lemon and bitter orange peel, as well as a combination of other spices, which may include any of anise, angelica root and seed, orris root, cardamom, pine needles and cone, licorice root, cinnamon, almond, cubeb, savory, lime peel, grapefruit peel, dragon eye (longan), saffron, baobab, frankincense, coriander, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cassia bark or others. The different combinations and concentrations of these botanicals in the distillation process cause the variations in taste among gin products.

Chemical research has begun to identify the various chemicals that are extracted in the distillation process and contribute to gin&#x27;s flavouring. For example, juniper monoterpenes come from juniper berries. Citric and berry flavours come from chemicals such as limonene and gamma-terpinene linalool found in limes, blueberries and hops amongst others. Floral notes come from compounds such as geraniol and eugenol. Spice-like flavours come from chemicals such as sabinene, delta-3-carene, and para-cymene.

In 2018, more than half the growth in the UK Gin category was contributed by flavoured gin.

=== Similar spirits ===
A similar drink, also made with juniper berries and called Borovička, is produced in the Slovak Republic.

<doc id="12990" wikidata="Q27123" url="?curid=12990" title="Gall–Peters projection">
<text>The Gall–Peters projection is a rectangular, equal-area map projection. Like all equal-area projections, it distorts most shapes. It is a cylindrical equal-area projection with latitudes 45° north and south as the regions on the map that have no distortion. The projection is named after James Gall and Arno Peters.

Gall described the projection in 1855 at a science convention and published a paper on it in 1885. Peters brought the projection to a wider audience beginning in the early 1970s through his &quot;Peters World Map&quot;. The name &quot;Gall–Peters projection&quot; was first used by Arthur H. Robinson in a pamphlet put out by the American Cartographic Association in 1986.

The Gall–Peters projection achieved notoriety in the late 20th century as the centerpiece of a controversy about the political implications of map design.

==Description==

===Formula===
The projection is conventionally defined as:

:formula_1

where &quot;λ&quot; is the longitude from the central meridian in degrees, &quot;φ&quot; is the latitude, and &quot;R&quot; is the radius of the globe used as the model of the earth for projection. For longitude given in radians, remove the factors.

===Simplified formula===
Stripping out unit conversion and uniform scaling, the formulae may be written:

:formula_2

where &quot;formula_3&quot; is the longitude from the central meridian (in radians), &quot;formula_4&quot; is the latitude, and &quot;R&quot; is the radius of the globe used as the model of the earth for projection. Hence the sphere is mapped onto the vertical cylinder, and the cylinder is stretched to double its length. The stretch factor, 2 in this case, is what distinguishes the variations of cylindric equal-area projection.

===Relation to cylindric equal-area projections===
The various specializations of the cylindric equal-area projection differ only in the ratio of the vertical to horizontal axis. This ratio determines the &quot;standard parallel&quot; of the projection, which is the parallel at which there is no distortion and along which distances match the stated scale. The standard parallels of the Gall–Peters are 45° N and 45° S. Several other specializations of the equal-area cylindric have been described, promoted, or otherwise named.

==Origins and naming==
The Gall–Peters projection was first described in 1855 by the Scottish clergyman James Gall, who presented it along with two other projections at the Glasgow meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (the BA). He gave it the name &quot;orthographic&quot; and formally published his work in 1885 in the &quot;Scottish Geographical Magazine&quot;. The projection is suggestive of the orthographic projection in that distances between parallels of the Gall–Peters are a constant multiple of the distances between the parallels of the orthographic. That constant is .

In 1967, the German filmmaker Arno Peters independently devised a similar projection, which he presented in 1973 as the &quot;Peters world map&quot;. Peters&#x27;s original description of his projection contained a geometric error that, taken literally, implies standard parallels of 46°02′ N/S. However the text accompanying the description made it clear that he had intended the standard parallels to be 45° N/S, making his projection identical to Gall&#x27;s orthographic. In any case, the difference is negligible in a world map.

The name &quot;Gall–Peters projection&quot; seems to have been used first by Arthur H. Robinson in a pamphlet put out by the American Cartographic Association in 1986. Before 1973 it had been known, when referred to at all, as the &quot;Gall orthographic&quot; or &quot;Gall&#x27;s orthographic&quot;. Most Peters supporters refer to it as the &quot;Peters projection&quot;. During the years of controversy, the cartographic articles tended to use one name or the other, while acknowledging both names. In recent years &quot;Gall–Peters&quot; seems to dominate.

==Peters world map controversy==
The Gall–Peters projection initially passed unnoticed when presented by Gall in 1855. It achieved more widespread attention after Arno Peters reintroduced it in 1973. He promoted it as a superior alternative to the commonly used Mercator projection, on the basis that the Mercator projection greatly distorts the relative sizes of regions on a map. In particular, he criticized that the Mercator projection causes wealthy Europe and North America to appear very large relative to poorer Africa and South America. These arguments swayed many socially concerned groups to adopt the Gall–Peters projection, including the National Council of Churches and the magazine &quot;New Internationalist&quot;.

His campaign was bolstered by the inaccurate claim that the Gall–Peters projection was the only &quot;area-correct&quot; map. In actuality, some of the oldest projections are equal-area (such as the sinusoidal projection), and hundreds have been described. He also inaccurately claimed that it possessed &quot;absolute angle conformality&quot;, had &quot;no extreme distortions of form&quot;, and was &quot;totally distance-factual&quot;. Peters framed his criticisms of the Mercator projection with criticisms of the broader cartographic community. In particular, Peters wrote in &quot;The New Cartography&quot;,

As Peters&#x27;s promotions gained popularity, the cartographic community reacted with hostility to his criticisms, as well as to the inaccuracy and lack of novelty of his claims. They called attention to the long list of cartographers who, over the preceding century, had formally expressed frustration with publishers&#x27; overuse of the Mercator and advocated for alternatives. In addition, several scholars criticized the particularly large distortions present in the Gall–Peters projection, and remarked on the irony of its undistorted presentation of the mid latitudes, including Peters&#x27;s native Germany, at the expense of the low latitudes, which host more of the technologically underdeveloped nations.

The increasing publicity of Peters&#x27;s claims in 1986 motivated the American Cartographic Association (now Cartography and Geographic Information Society) to produce a series of booklets (including &quot;Which Map Is Best&quot;) designed to educate the public about map projections and distortion in maps. In 1989 and 1990, after some internal debate, seven North American geographic organizations adopted a resolution rejecting all rectangular world maps, a category that includes both the Mercator and the Gall–Peters projections, though the North American Cartographic Information Society notably declined to endorse it.

The two camps never made any real attempts toward reconciliation. The Peters camp largely ignored the protests of the cartographers, and did not acknowledge Gall&#x27;s prior work until the controversy had largely run its course, late in Peters&#x27;s life. While he likely devised the projection independently, his unscholarly conduct and refusal to engage the cartographic community undoubtedly contributed to the polarization and impasse.

In the ensuing decades, J. Brian Harley credited the Peters phenomenon with demonstrating the social implications of map projections.

== Adoption ==
Maps based on the projection are promoted by UNESCO, and they are also widely used by British schools. The U.S. state of Massachusetts and Boston Public Schools began phasing in these maps in March 2017, becoming the first public school district and state in the United States to adopt Gall–Peters maps as their standard. Until its dissolution in 2020, Amherst-based ODT Maps Inc. was the exclusive North American publisher of Peters and Hobo–Dyer projection maps. On April 16, 2024, Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen signed a law that requires public schools to display maps based on the Gall–Peters projection, a similar cylindrical equal-area projection, or the AuthaGraph projection beginning in the 2024–2025 school year.

<text>Ingram Cecil Connor III (November 5, 1946 – September 19, 1973), known professionally as Gram Parsons, was an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and pianist. He recorded with the International Submarine Band, the Byrds, and the Flying Burrito Brothers, popularizing what he called &quot;Cosmic American Music&quot;, a hybrid of country, rhythm and blues, soul, folk, and rock. He has been credited with helping to found the country rock and alt-country genres and received a ranking of No. 87 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

==Early life and education==
Ingram Cecil Connor III was born on November 5, 1946, in Winter Haven, Florida, to Ingram Cecil Connor II, aka &quot;Coon Dog&quot;, and Avis Snively Connor. He had one sibling, a sister named “Little Avis”. Connor II was a World War II flying ace, decorated with the Air Medal, who worked at his father-in-law&#x27;s company and was a local Boy Scout official. Both parents were alcoholics and both suffered from depression; Cecil II shot himself on December 23, 1958. Avis then married Robert Parsons, whose surname was adopted by Gram and his sister. Avis and Robert would have one child, Parsons’ half-sister Diane.

Avis was the daughter of citrus fruit magnate John A. Snively, who held extensive properties in Winter Haven FL and Waycross Georgia, where the Connors normally lived. Parsons attended The Bolles School in Jacksonville before transferring to the public Winter Haven High School; after failing his junior year there, he returned to Bolles. On his graduation day, June 5, 1965, his mother died of complications from alcoholism. Robert Parsons had been having an affair with Diane’s nanny; they married shortly after Avis’ death. Gram went on to Harvard, which he attended for one semester. At age 21, he began to receive his annual trust fund income of $30,000.

==Career==
Parsons developed strong musical interests early in life, particularly after seeing Elvis Presley perform in concert in Waycross, on February 22, 1956. Five years later, he was playing in rock and roll cover bands such as the Pacers and the Legends, headlining in Winter Haven/Polk County clubs owned by his stepfather. By age 16, he had graduated to folk music, and in 1963 he teamed up with his first professional outfit, the Shilohs. Heavily influenced by The Kingston Trio and The Journeymen, the band played hootenannies, coffee houses and high school auditoriums; as Parsons was still enrolled in prep school, he performed with the group only in select engagements. Forays into New York City included a performance at Florida&#x27;s exhibition in the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair and regular appearances at the Café Rafio on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village in the summer of 1964. Although John Phillips (an acquaintance of Shiloh George Wrigley) arranged an exploratory meeting with Albert Grossman, the impresario balked at booking the group for a Christmas engagement at The Bitter End when he discovered that the Shilohs were high school students. Following a recording session at the radio station of Bob Jones University, the group reached a creative impasse amid the emergence of folk rock and dissolved in the spring of 1965.

=== The International Submarine Band (1966–1967) ===

In 1966, he and other musicians from the Boston folk scene formed a group called the International Submarine Band. In 1967, after briefly residing in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx, they moved to Los Angeles. Following several lineup changes, the band signed to Lee Hazlewood&#x27;s LHI Records, where they spent late 1967 recording &quot;Safe at Home&quot;. The album contains one of Parsons&#x27; best-known songs, &quot;Luxury Liner&quot;, and an early version of &quot;Do You Know How It Feels,&quot; which he revised later in his career. &quot;Safe at Home&quot; would remain unreleased until mid-1968, by which time the International Submarine Band had broken up.

The International Submarine Band appeared in the Peter Fonda film &quot;The Trip&quot; (1967) as a performing band in one of the clubs. Their song &quot;Lazy Days&quot; was offered for the film&#x27;s soundtrack, but the soundtrack was done by Mike Bloomfield&#x27;s Electric Flag. In 1967, Peter Fonda recorded a version of the Parsons&#x27; song &quot;November Nights&quot; titled &quot;November Night&quot;. The song was released as a single in March 1967, with Donovan&#x27;s &quot;Catch the Wind&quot; on the B side.

===The Byrds (1968)===

By 1968, Parsons came to the attention of The Byrds&#x27; bassist, Chris Hillman, via business manager Larry Spector, who was looking for a new band member following the departures of David Crosby and Michael Clarke. In February 1968, Parsons passed an audition for the band, being initially recruited as a jazz pianist but soon adding rhythm guitar and vocals.

Although Parsons was an equal contributor to the band, he was not regarded as a full member by the band&#x27;s label, Columbia Records. Consequently, when the Byrds&#x27; recording contract was renewed on February 29, 1968, it was only original members Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman who signed it. Parsons, like fellow new recruit Kevin Kelley, was hired as a sideman and received a salary from McGuinn and Hillman. In later years, this led Hillman to state, &quot;Gram was hired. He was not a member of the Byrds, ever. He was on salary; that was the only way we could get him to turn up.&quot; Parsons and Kelley were given equal billing alongside McGuinn, and Hillman on the &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; album, and in press coverage.

&quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; was conceived by McGuinn as a double-album history of American popular music. It was to begin with bluegrass, then move through country and western, jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock music, before ending with electronic music. However, as recording plans were made, Parsons persuaded the other members to leave Los Angeles and record the album in Nashville. McGuinn&#x27;s concept was jettisoned in favor of a country project, which included Parsons&#x27; songs &quot;One Hundred Years from Now&quot; and &quot;Hickory Wind&quot;, and songs by Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie and Merle Haggard.

Recording sessions for &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; commenced at Columbia Records&#x27; recording studios in the Music Row area of Nashville on March 9, 1968. Mid-way through, the sessions moved to Columbia Studios, Hollywood and were completed on May 27, 1968. However, Parsons was still under contract to LHI Records and Hazlewood threatened legal action over Parsons&#x27; appearance on the album. As a result, McGuinn replaced three of Parsons&#x27; lead vocals with his own; in 1973, in an interview with Cameron Crowe, Parsons said that McGuinn &quot;erased it and did the vocals himself and fucked it up.&quot; Parsons remained as lead vocalist on the songs &quot;You&#x27;re Still on My Mind&quot;, &quot;Life in Prison&quot;, and &quot;Hickory Wind&quot;.

While in England with the Byrds in the summer of 1968, Parsons left the band over a planned concert tour of South Africa and his opposition to apartheid. During this period Parsons became acquainted with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones. After leaving the band, Parsons stayed at Richards&#x27; house and the pair developed a close friendship, with Parsons reintroducing the guitarist to country music.

===The Flying Burrito Brothers (1969–1970)===
Returning to Los Angeles, Parsons sought out Chris Hillman, and the two formed The Flying Burrito Brothers with bassist Chris Ethridge and pedal steel player Sneaky Pete Kleinow. Their 1969 album &quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot; marked the culmination of Parsons&#x27; post-1966 musical vision: a modernized variant of the Bakersfield sound that was popularized by Buck Owens amalgamated with strands of soul and psychedelic rock. The band appeared on the album cover wearing Nudie suits emblazoned with hippie symbols, including marijuana, Tuinal, and Seconal-inspired patches. Along with the Parsons-Hillman originals &quot;Christine&#x27;s Tune&quot; and &quot;Sin City&quot; were versions of the soul music classics &quot;The Dark End of the Street&quot; and &quot;Do Right Woman, Do Right Man&quot;, the latter featuring David Crosby on high harmony. The original songs were the result of a productive songwriting partnership between Parsons and Hillman, who were sharing a bachelor pad in the San Fernando Valley. The pronounced gospel-soul influence on this album likely evolved from the ecumenical tastes of bassist Chris Ethridge, who co-wrote &quot;Hot Burrito No. 1/I&#x27;m Your Toy&quot; and &quot;Hot Burrito No. 2&quot; with Parsons.

Original drummer Eddie Hoh was unable to perform adequate takes due to a substance abuse problem. He was dismissed after two songs and the band used session drummers, including former International Submarine Band drummer Jon Corneal and Popeye Phillips. Before commencing live performances, the group settled on original Byrds drummer Michael Clarke.

&quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot; was commercially unsuccessful. Critic Robert Christgau called it &quot;an ominous, obsessive, tongue-in-cheek country-rock synthesis, absorbing rural and urban, traditional and contemporary, at point of impact.&quot; Parsons suffered from fear of flying and the band toured via train. The band members lost most of their money in a perpetual poker game and their concerts were met with bewilderment. Parsons was taking psilocybin and cocaine, so his performances were erratic. The most successful appearance was in Philadelphia, where the group opened for the reconstituted Byrds. Midway through their set, Parsons joined the headline act and fronted his former group on renditions of &quot;Hickory Wind&quot; and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Miss Your Water&quot;.

After returning to Los Angeles, the group recorded &quot;The Train Song&quot;, written during an increasingly infrequent songwriting session on the train and produced by 1950s R&amp;B legends Larry Williams and Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson. Despite a request from the Burritos that the remnants of their publicity budget be diverted to the promotion of the single, it also flopped. During this period, Ethridge departed, saying that he did not share Parsons&#x27; and Hillman&#x27;s affinity for country music. He was replaced by lead guitarist Bernie Leadon, while Hillman reverted to bass.

By this time, Parsons&#x27;s drug use had increased to the point where new songs were rare, and much of his time was spent partying with the Rolling Stones, who were in America finishing &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;. As the Stones prepared to play the nation&#x27;s largest venues, the Burritos played to dwindling nightclub audiences. But they were booked as one of the acts at the Altamont Music Festival. They played a short set, including &quot;Bony Moronie&quot; and &quot;Six Days on the Road&quot;, which was included in the event&#x27;s documentary &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;.

With mounting debt incurred, A&amp;M hoped to recoup some of its losses by marketing the Burritos as a straight country group. Manager Jim Dickson instigated a session where the band recorded honky tonk staples and contemporary pop covers in a countrified vein, but this was scrapped in favor of a second album of originals on an extremely reduced budget.

Faced with a dearth of new material, most of the album was hastily written in the studio by Leadon, Hillman, and Parsons, with two &quot;Gilded Palace of Sin&quot; outtakes thrown into the mix. The resulting album, &quot;Burrito Deluxe&quot;, was released in April 1970. Although it is considered less inspired than its predecessor, it is notable for the song &quot;Older Guys&quot; and for the band&#x27;s take on &quot;Wild Horses&quot;.

Like its predecessor, &quot;Burrito Deluxe&quot; under-performed commercially but also failed to carry the critical cachet of the debut. Disenchanted, Parsons left the Burritos in mutual agreement with Hillman; under Hillman, the group recorded one more album before dissolving in 1971.

===Solo career and touring with Emmylou Harris (1970–1973)===

In early 1970, Parsons signed a solo deal with A&amp;M Records and moved in with producer Terry Melcher. The two shared a penchant for cocaine and heroin, and the sessions were largely unproductive, with Parsons eventually losing interest in the project. The master tapes were lost; it is unclear who took them.
Parsons accompanied the Rolling Stones on their 1971 U.K. tour in the hope of being signed to the newly-formed Rolling Stones Records. He lived at Richards&#x27; French villa Nellcôte during the recording of &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot;, though he contributed little to the process. His drug use and constant quarrelling with his girlfriend, Gretchen Burrell, led to a request to leave by Richards&#x27; girlfriend, Anita Pallenberg. Parsons attempted to rekindle his relationship with the band on their 1972 American tour, to no avail.

Parsons returned to the US for a one-off concert with the Burritos. In Washington, D.C., he met Emmy Lou Harris and asked her to join him in Los Angeles to record his first solo album. It came as a surprise to many when Parsons was signed to Reprise Records by Mo Ostin in mid-1972. The ensuing &quot;GP&quot; (1973) featured several members of Elvis Presley&#x27;s TCB Band. It included six new songs from Parsons alongside several country covers, including Tompall Glaser&#x27;s &quot;Streets of Baltimore&quot; and George Jones&#x27; &quot;That&#x27;s All It Took&quot;. 

Parsons, now featuring Harris as his duet partner, toured across the U.S. as Gram Parsons and the Fallen Angels in February–March 1973. Unable to afford the TCB Band, the group featured guitarists Jock Bartley and Larry Coryell, Neil Flanz on pedal steel, bassist Kyle Tullis, and drummer N.D. Smart. The touring party also included Parsons&#x27; new wife, Gretchen Parsons, who was envious of Harris and her young daughter. Coordinating the spectacle as road manager was Phil Kaufman, who had served time with Charles Manson on Terminal Island but who ensured that the performer stayed clear of drugs and limited his alcohol intake during shows. At first, the band was under-rehearsed and played poorly; however, they improved with steady gigging and received rapturous responses at several counter-cultural venues, including Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin, Max&#x27;s Kansas City in New York City, and Liberty Hall in Houston, where Neil Young and Linda Ronstadt sat in for a filmed performance. Nevertheless, the tour failed to galvanize sales of &quot;GP&quot;, which never charted in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

For his next and final album, 1974&#x27;s posthumously released &quot;Grievous Angel&quot;, Parsons used Harris and members of the TCB Band. The record received more enthusiastic reviews than &quot;GP&quot;. Although Parsons only contributed two new songs to the album (&quot;In My Hour of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Return of the Grievous Angel&quot;), he was reportedly enthusiastic with his new sound and seemed to have finally adopted a diligent mindset to his musical career, limiting his intake of alcohol and opiates during most of the sessions. &quot;Grievous Angel&quot; peaked at number 195 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

Before recording, Parsons and Harris played a preliminary four-show mini-tour as the headline act in a June 1973 Warner Records country rock package with the New Kentucky Colonels and Country Gazette. A shared backing band included Clarence White, Pete Kleinow and Chris Ethridge. On July 15, 1973, White was killed by a drunk driver in Palmdale, California, while loading equipment in his car for a concert with the New Kentucky Colonels. At White&#x27;s funeral, Parsons and Bernie Leadon performed a rendition of &quot;Farther Along&quot;; that evening, Parsons reportedly informed Phil Kaufman of his final wish: to be cremated in Joshua Tree National Park.

==Personal life==
In 1971, Parsons married Gretchen Burrell (nee Gretchen Lisl Berrill) at his stepfather&#x27;s New Orleans estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;californiabirthindex/4567413&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tcmdb/0%7C208758&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
Parsons and Burrell went to England, where they visited their friend Ric Grech. With the help of Grech and his friend Hank Wangford, Parsons stopped using heroin.

In the summer of 1973, Parsons&#x27; Topanga Canyon home burned to the ground, the result of a stray cigarette. Nearly all of his possessions were destroyed with the exception of a guitar and a prized Jaguar. The fire proved to be the last straw in the relationship between Burrell and Parsons, who moved into a spare room in Kaufman&#x27;s house. Parsons rekindled his relationship with Margaret Fisher, a high school sweetheart from Waycross.

Parsons had one child, born to Nancy Ross in 1967, a daughter named Polly Parsons.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/2004-jul-08-wk-pop8&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

In the late 1960s, Parsons began to vacation at Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California, where he used psychedelics and said he experienced UFO sightings. After splitting from Burrell, Parsons often spent his weekends there, with Margaret Fisher and Phil Kaufman. Scheduled to resume touring in October 1973, Parsons decided to go on another recuperative excursion on September 17. Accompanying him were Fisher, his assistant Michael Martin, and Martin&#x27;s girlfriend Dale McElroy.

On both nights of their stay, Parsons retreated to the desert, consuming large amounts of alcohol and barbiturates, while the rest of the group visited bars in nearby Yucca Valley. On September 18, Martin drove back to Los Angeles to resupply the group with marijuana. That night, Parsons challenged Fisher and McElroy to drink with him–Fisher didn&#x27;t drink and McElroy was recovering from illness. Parsons said that he&#x27;d drink for the three of them and drank six double tequilas. The three then went to the Joshua Tree Inn, where Parsons purchased morphine from an unknown woman; after being injected by her in Room #1, he overdosed. Fisher gave Parsons an ice cube suppository, and then a cold shower and moved him to Room #8. She put him to bed and went out to buy coffee in the hope of reviving him, leaving McElroy to stand guard. As his breathing became irregular and then ceased, McElroy attempted resuscitation. After all attempts failed, they called an ambulance. Parsons was declared dead on arrival at Yucca Valley Hospital at 12:15 a.m. on September 19, 1973. The official cause of death was an overdose of morphine and alcohol. Kaufman drove Fisher and McElroy back to Los Angeles and then dispersed the rest of Parsons&#x27; drugs in the desert.
Although Parsons had said he wanted his body cremated at Joshua Tree and his ashes spread over the formation Cap Rock, Parsons&#x27; stepfather organized a private ceremony in New Orleans and left the body in the care of a funeral home. But, to fulfill Parsons&#x27; wishes, Kaufman and a friend stole both a hearse and his body and drove it to Joshua Tree. At Cap Rock Parking Lot, they poured gasoline into the open coffin and lit it, creating an enormous fireball. They were arrested and eventually fined $750.00, for stealing the coffin. What remained of Parsons&#x27; body was buried in Garden of Memories Cemetery in Metairie, Louisiana.

The story brings Parsons fans out to a large rock flake known to rock climbers as &#x27;The Gram Parsons Memorial Hand Traverse&#x27;. At some point, someone added a slab that marked Parsons&#x27; cremation to the memorial rock; that slab was removed by the U.S. National Park Service and is now at the Joshua Tree Inn. Joshua Tree park guides are given the option to tell the story of Parsons&#x27; cremation during tours, but there is no mention of the act in official maps or brochures.

==Legacy==
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic describes Parsons as &quot;enormously influential&quot; for both country and rock, &quot;blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other...his influence could still be heard well into the next millennium.&quot; In his 2005 essay on Parsons for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artist&quot; list, Keith Richards notes that Parsons&#x27; recorded music output was &quot;pretty minimal&quot; but says that Parsons&#x27; &quot;effect on country music is enormous...and this is why we&#x27;re talking about him now.&quot;

Emmylou Harris continued to champion Parsons&#x27; work, covering a number of his songs, including &quot;Hickory Wind&quot;, &quot;Wheels&quot;, &quot;Sin City&quot;, &quot;Luxury Liner&quot;, and &quot;Hot Burrito No. 2&quot;. Harris&#x27;s songs &quot;Boulder to Birmingham&quot;, from her 1975 album &quot;Pieces of the Sky&quot;, and &quot;The Road&quot;, from her 2011 album &quot;Hard Bargain&quot;, are tributes to Parsons. Her 1985 album &quot;The Ballad of Sally Rose&quot; includes many allusions to Parsons in its narrative. The song &quot;My Man&quot;, written by Bernie Leadon and performed by the Eagles on their album &quot;On the Border&quot;, is a tribute to Gram Parsons.

The 1973 album &quot;Crazy Eyes&quot; by Poco pays homage to Parsons, as Richie Furay composed the title track in honor of him, and sings one of Parsons&#x27; own compositions, &quot;Brass Buttons.&quot; The album was released four days before Parsons died.

Between 1996 and 2006, a festival called &quot;Gram Fest&quot;, aka &quot;The Cosmic Americana Music Festival&quot; was held annually at Joshua Tree. The Gram Parsons Guitar Pull and Tribute Festival, in Waycross, Georgia, was founded in 1997 and continues today.

In 2003 the Americana Music Awards awarded Parsons with the President&#x27;s Award, which was accepted by his daughter.

The 2003 film &quot;Grand Theft Parsons&quot; stars Johnny Knoxville as Phil Kaufman and chronicles a farcical version of the theft of Parsons&#x27; corpse. In 2006, Gandulf Hennig released the documentary &quot;Gram Parsons: Fallen Angel&quot;.

In 2004, Parsons&#x27; daughter Polly produced two tribute concerts titled &quot;Return to Sin City: A Tribute to Gram Parsons&quot;. Artists included Keith Richards, James Burton, Lucinda Williams, Norah Jones, Dwight Yoakam, John Doe, Steve Earle, Jim Lauderdale, Kathleen Edwards, Jay Farrar, Jim James, Raul Malo, Susan Marshall, and the Sin City All Stars. The concert produced a DVD and 100% of the concerts was donated through the Gram Parsons Foundation to the Musician&#x27;s Assistance Program (now MusiCares), which aids musicians in crisis.

Despite his influence, Parsons has yet to be inducted into either the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame or the Country Music Hall of Fame. The Gram Parsons Petition Project (later named Gram Parsons InterNational) was begun in May 2008 in support of a drive to induct Parsons into the Country Music Hall of Fame. On September 19, 2008, the 35th anniversary of Parsons&#x27; death, it was presented to the Country Music Association (CMA) with the official Nomination Proposal.

In November 2009, the musical theatre production &quot;Grievous Angel: The Legend of Gram Parsons&quot; premiered, starring Anders Drerup as Gram Parsons and Kelly Prescott as Emmylou Harris. Directed by Michael Bate and co-written by Bate and David McDonald, the production was inspired by a March 1973 interview that Bate conducted with Parsons, which became Parsons&#x27; last recorded conversation.

In 2012, Swedish folk duo First Aid Kit released the single &quot;Emmylou&quot; from the album &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Roar&quot;. The song&#x27;s chorus is a lyrical acknowledgment of the Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris singing partnership. 

In the fall of 2012 Florida festival promoter and musician Randy Judy presented his bio-musical &quot;Farther Along – The Music and Life of Gram Parsons&quot; at Magnoliafest at the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park.

Tribute bands include Cleveland&#x27;s New Soft Shoe and, out of St. Paul, The Gilded Palace Sinners.&lt;ref name=&quot;minnesotamonthly/november-picks&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;twincities/2016/tribute-shows-void&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2022, Dave Prinz, co-founder of Amoeba Music, rediscovered Gram Parsons&#x27; &quot;Last Roundup&quot; tapes featuring Emmylou Harris with Gram Parsons and the Fallen Angels. Prinz initiated a campaign to fund the release independently, in partnership with Polly Parsons. The campaign launched on November 17, 2022, and was fully backed. Gram Parsons &amp; The Fallen Angels&#x27; &quot;The Last Roundup: Live from The Bijou Café in Philadelphia 3/16/73&quot; was released on limited-edition vinyl on Friday, November 24, 2023, and was considered one of the hits of Record Store Day 2023.

<doc id="12992" wikidata="Q3109549" url="?curid=12992" title="Go-fast boat">
<text>A go-fast boat is a small, fast powerboat designed with a long narrow platform and a planing hull. Depending on definitions used, it is either a speedboat (synonymously) or a certain type of speedboat.

During the United States alcohol prohibition era, these boats were used in &quot;rum-running&quot;, transferring illegal liquor from larger vessels waiting outside US territorial waters to the mainland. Their high speed enabled them to avoid interception by the law enforcement. The present conception of such boats is based largely on designs by Donald Aronow for offshore powerboat racing in the 1960s. During this period, these boats were also used by drug smugglers to transfer drugs across the Caribbean to the United States.

==Name==

Go-fast boats are also called cigarette boats or cigar boats—references to their hull shape, to the items that they are (archetypally) used to smuggle (see &quot;Illicit cigarette trade&quot; and &quot;Cuban cigar&quot;), or both.

The term &quot;cigarette boat&quot; is especially popular because it is a brand name for a line of go-fast boats that popularized and largely defined the class in the 1960s, made by Don Aronow&#x27;s Cigarette Racing Team. &quot;Cigar boat&quot; is often preferred because it avoids confusion with that brand.

Although modern go-fast boats postdate the fleet that was used for rum-running during the Great Depression, some of those boats were small and extremely fast, a theme that is shared with later smuggling (such as drug smuggling); thus, go-fast boats are sometimes informally (jocularly) called rum-runners.

==Construction==

A typical go-fast is laid-up using a combination of fibreglass, kevlar and carbon fibre, using a deep &quot;&quot; style offshore racing hull ranging from long, narrow in beam, and equipped with two or more powerful engines, often totalling more than . The boats can typically travel at speeds over in calm waters, over in choppy waters, and maintain in the average Caribbean seas. They are heavy enough to cut through higher waves, although slower.

==Use==
Reflecting their racing heritage, accommodations on these five-or-fewer-passenger boats are minimal. A small low cabin under the foredeck is typical, much smaller than a typical motor yacht of similar size. In addition to racing, most buyers buy these boats for their mystique, immense power, high top speeds, and sleek shape.

==Illegal use==

These boats are difficult to detect by radar except on flat calm seas or at close range. The United States Coast Guard and the DEA found them to be stealthy, fast, seaworthy, and very difficult to intercept using conventional craft. Due to this, Coast Guards have developed their own high-speed craft and use helicopters equipped with anti-materiel rifles used to disable engines of fleeing boats. The US Coast Guard go-fast boat is a rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB) equipped with radar and powerful engines. The RHIB is armed with several types of non-lethal weapons and an M240 GPMG.

==Media portrayal==
In the 2006 film &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, go-fast boats are used to smuggle drugs for cartels.

<text>The City Chambers or Municipal Buildings in Glasgow, Scotland, has functioned as the headquarters of Glasgow City Council since 1996, and of preceding forms of municipal government in the city since 1889. It is located on the eastern side of the city&#x27;s George Square. It is a Category A listed building.

==History==
The need for a new city chambers had been apparent since the 18th century, with the old Glasgow Tolbooth at Glasgow Cross becoming insufficient for the purposes of civic government in a growing town with greater political responsibilities. In 1814, the tolbooth was sold – with the exception of the steeple, which still remains – and the council chambers moved to the public buildings in the Saltmarket, near Glasgow Green. A subsequent move took the city council to the city and county buildings between Wilson Street and Ingram Street in 1844. In the early 1880s, City Architect John Carrick was asked to identify a suitable site for a purpose-built City Council Chambers. Carrick identified the east side of George Square, which was then bought.

Following a design competition, the building was designed by the Scottish architect William Young in the Victorian style and construction started in 1882. The building was inaugurated by Queen Victoria in August 1888 and the first council meeting held within the chambers took place in October 1889. An extension connected by pairs of archways across John Street was completed in 1912 and Exchange House in George Street was completed in the mid-1980s.

The new City Chambers initially housed Glasgow Town Council from 1888 to 1895, when that body was replaced by Glasgow Corporation. It remained the corporation&#x27;s headquarters until it was replaced by Glasgow District Council under the wider Strathclyde Regional Council in May 1975. It then remained the Glasgow District Council headquarters until the abolition of the Strathclyde Region led to the formation of Glasgow City Council in April 1996.

==Architecture==
===Exterior===
The building is in the Beaux arts style, an interpretation of Renaissance Classicism incorporating Italianate styles with a vast range of ornate decoration, used to express the wealth and industrial export-led economic prosperity of the Second City of the Empire. The exterior sculpture, by James Alexander Ewing, included the central Jubilee Pediment as its centrepiece. Although originally intended to feature a figure symbolising Glasgow &#x27;with the Clyde at her feet sending her manufactures to all the world&#x27;, the Pediment was redesigned to celebrate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. It depicts Victoria enthroned, surrounded by emblematic figures of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales, alongside the colonies of the British Empire (mostly British India). Ewing also designed the apex sculptures of Truth, Riches, and Honour, and the statues of The Four Seasons on the Chamber&#x27;s tower. The central apex figure of Truth is popularly known as Glasgow&#x27;s Statue of Liberty, because of its close resemblance to the similarly posed, but very much larger, statue in New York harbour.

===Interior===
The entrance hall of the Chambers displays a mosaic of the city&#x27;s coat of arms on the floor, which dates from the 1950s when the city&#x27;s coat of arms was last modified. The arms reflect legends about Glasgow&#x27;s patron saint, Saint Mungo, and include four emblems – the bird, tree, bell, and fish – as remembered in the following verse:

:&quot;Here&#x27;s the Bird that never flew&quot;
:&quot;Here&#x27;s the Tree that never grew&quot;
:&quot;Here&#x27;s the Bell that never rang&quot;
:&quot;Here&#x27;s the Fish that never swam&quot;

The ornate banqueting hall, which is long by wide and high, is decorated with huge murals by the Glasgow Boys. The decoration was co-ordinated by architect William Leiper. The room hosted Nelson Mandela and Sir Alex Ferguson when they received the Freedom of the City in 1993 and 1999, respectively. In March 2015, it hosted the medal ceremony for Bob Fulton, Robert Somerville and John Keenan, three retired Rolls-Royce factory workers, honoured for their boycott against the Chilean Air Force during the dictatorship of General Pinochet of Chile. The ceremony is part of the documentary Nae Pasaran. The Council Chamber is clad in Spanish mahogany panelling and its windows are made of Venetian stained glass.

==In popular culture==
The building was used as a stand in for the British Embassy in Moscow in the film &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot; in 1983, and as the Vatican in &quot;Heavenly Pursuits&quot; in 1986. It was also used for the film &quot;The House of Mirth&quot; in 2000 and featured more recently in the television series &quot;Outlander&quot;.
