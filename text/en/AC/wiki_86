<text>Henrik Johan Ibsen (; ; 20 March 1828 – 23 May 1906) was a Norwegian playwright and theatre director. Ibsen is considered the world&#x27;s pre-eminent dramatist of the 19th century and is often referred to as &quot;the father of modern drama.&quot; He pioneered theatrical realism, but also wrote lyrical epic works. His major works include &quot;Brand&quot;, &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, &quot;Emperor and Galilean&quot;, &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, &quot;Ghosts&quot;, &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;, &quot;The Wild Duck&quot;, &quot;Rosmersholm&quot;, &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;, &quot;The Master Builder&quot;, and &quot;When We Dead Awaken&quot;. Ibsen is the most frequently performed dramatist in the world after Shakespeare, and &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; was the world&#x27;s most performed play in 2006.

Ibsen was born into the merchant elite of the port town of Skien, and had strong family ties to the families who had held power and wealth in Telemark since the mid-1500s. Both his parents belonged socially or biologically to the Paus family of Rising and Altenburggården—the extended family of the siblings Ole Paus and Hedevig Paus—and Ibsen described his own background as patrician. Ibsen established himself as a theater director in Norway during the 1850s and gained international recognition as a playwright with the plays &quot;Brand&quot; and &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; in the 1860s. From 1864, he lived for 27 years in Italy and Germany, primarily in Rome, Dresden, and Munich, making only brief visits to Norway, before moving to Christiania in 1891. Most of Ibsen&#x27;s plays are set in Norway, often in bourgeois environments and places reminiscent of Skien, and he frequently drew inspiration from family members. Ibsen&#x27;s early poetic and cinematic play &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; has strong surreal elements. After &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; Ibsen abandoned verse and wrote in realistic prose. Several of his later dramas were considered scandalous to many of his era, when European theatre was expected to model strict morals of family life and propriety. Ibsen&#x27;s later work examined the realities that lay behind the façades, revealing much that was disquieting to a number of his contemporaries. He had a critical eye and conducted a free inquiry into the conditions of life and issues of morality. In many critics&#x27; estimates &quot;The Wild Duck&quot; and &quot;Rosmersholm&quot; are &quot;vying with each other as rivals for the top place among Ibsen&#x27;s works&quot;; Ibsen himself regarded &quot;Emperor and Galilean&quot; as his masterpiece.

Ibsen is considered one of the most important playwrights in the history of world literature, and is widely regarded as the foremost playwright of the nineteenth century. Sigmund Freud considered him on par with Shakespeare and Sophocles, while George Bernard Shaw argued that Ibsen had surpassed Shakespeare as the world&#x27;s pre-eminent dramatist. Ibsen influenced other playwrights and novelists such as George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, and James Joyce. Considered a profound poetic dramatist, he is widely regarded as the most important playwright since Shakespeare. Ibsen is commonly described as the most famous Norwegian internationally. Ibsen wrote his plays in Dano-Norwegian, and they were published by the Danish publisher Gyldendal. He was the father of Prime Minister Sigurd Ibsen and a relative of the singer Ole Paus.

==Early life and background==
Henrik Johan Ibsen was born on 20 March 1828 in &quot;Stockmanngården&quot; into an affluent merchant family in the prosperous port town of Skien in Bratsberg (Telemark). He was the son of the merchant Knud Plesner Ibsen (1797–1877) and Marichen Cornelia Martine Altenburg (1799–1869), and he grew up socially as a member of the Paus family, which consisted of the siblings Ole and Hedevig Paus and their tightly knit families. Ibsen&#x27;s ancestors were primarily merchants and shipowners in cities such as Skien and Bergen, or members of the &quot;aristocracy of officials&quot; of Upper Telemark, the region&#x27;s civil servant elite. Jørgen Haave writes that Ibsen &quot;had strong family ties to the families who had held power and wealth in Telemark since the mid-1500s.&quot; Henrik Ibsen himself wrote that &quot;my parents were members on both sides of the most respected families in Skien&quot;, and that he was closely related to &quot;just about all the patrician families who then dominated the place and its surroundings.&quot; He was baptised at home in the Lutheran state church—membership of which was mandatory—on 28 March and the baptism was confirmed in on 19 June. When Ibsen was born, Skien had for centuries been one of Norway&#x27;s most important and internationally oriented cities, and a centre of seafaring, timber exports and early industrialization that had made Norway the developed and prosperous part of Denmark–Norway.

===The Paus family of Rising and Altenburg House===
Ibsen&#x27;s parents, Knud and Marichen, grew up as close relatives, sometimes referred to as &quot;near-siblings,&quot; and both belonged to the tightly intertwined Paus family of Rising and Altenburg House – that is, the extended family of the sibling pair Ole Paus (1766–1855) and Hedevig Paus (1763–1848).

After Knud&#x27;s father Henrich Johan Ibsen (1765–1797) died at sea when Knud was newborn in 1797, his mother Johanne Plesner (1770–1847) married captain Ole Paus (1766–1855) the following year. Like Henrich Johan Ibsen before him, Paus thus became the brother-in-law of Skien&#x27;s wealthiest man, Diderik von Cappelen. In 1799, Ole Paus sold the Ibsen House in Skien&#x27;s Løvestrædet (Lion&#x27;s Street), which he had inherited from his wife&#x27;s first husband, and bought the estate Rising outside Skien from a sister of his brother-in-law von Cappelen. Knud grew up at Rising with most of his many half-siblings, among them the later governor Christian Cornelius Paus and the shipowner Christopher Blom Paus. In the 1801 census the Paus family of Rising had seven servants.

Marichen grew up in the stately Altenburg House in the center of Skien with her parents Hedevig Paus and Johan Andreas Altenburg. Altenburg was a shipowner, timber merchant, and owned a large liquor distillery at Lundetangen and a farm outside of town, and after his death, Hedevig took over the business in 1824.

The siblings Ole and Hedevig Paus were born in Lårdal in Upper Telemark, where the Paus family belonged to the region&#x27;s elite, the &quot;aristocracy of officials,&quot; and had moved to Skien at a young age with their oldest sister, joining Skien&#x27;s merchant elite with the support of their relatives in the family Blom. The children from Ole&#x27;s and Hedevig&#x27;s homes maintained close contact throughout Knud&#x27;s and Marichen&#x27;s childhood; notably, Ole&#x27;s oldest son, Knud&#x27;s half-brother Henrik Johan Paus, was raised in Hedevig&#x27;s home.

===Knud Ibsen&#x27;s marriage to Marichen Altenburg===

In 1825, Henrik&#x27;s father Knud acquired the burghership of Skien and established an independent business as a timber and luxury goods merchant there, with his younger brother, Christopher Blom Paus, then aged 15, as his apprentice. The two brothers moved into the Stockmanngården building, where they rented a part of the building and lived with a maid. On the first floor the brothers sold foreign wines and a variety of luxury items, while also engaging in wholesale export of timber in cooperation with their first cousin Diderik von Cappelen (1795–1866). On 1 December 1825, Knud married his stepfather&#x27;s niece Marichen, who then moved in with them. Henrik was born there in 1828. In 1830, Marichen&#x27;s mother Hedevig left Altenburggården and her properties and business ventures to her son-in-law Knud, and the Ibsen family moved to Marichen&#x27;s childhood home in 1831. During the 1820s and 1830s, Knud was a wealthy young merchant in Skien, and he was the city&#x27;s 16th largest taxpayer in 1833.

Older Ibsen scholars have claimed that Henrik Ibsen was fascinated by his parents&#x27; &quot;strange, almost incestuous marriage&quot;, and he would treat the subject of incestuous relationships in several plays, notably in his masterpiece &quot;Rosmersholm&quot;. On the other hand, Jørgen Haave points out that his parents&#x27; close relationship was not that unusual among the Skien elite.

===Childhood===

In his unfinished biography &quot;From Skien to Rome,&quot; Henrik Ibsen wrote about the Skien of his childhood:
Haave writes that the sources who knew Henrik in childhood described him as &quot;a boy who was pampered by his father, who enjoyed being creative in solitude, and who provoked peers with his superiority and arrogance.&quot; Henrik engaged in model theater, which was particularly popular among boys from bourgeois homes in Europe in the early 1800s. In contrast to his father, who was described as sociable and playful with a cheerful and friendly demeanor, Henrik was depicted as a more introverted personality. This trait was said to be shared with several relatives in the Paus family, and later with his own son, Sigurd. Johan Kielland Bergwitz claimed that &quot;it is with the Paus family that Henrik Ibsen has the most pronounced temperament traits in common.&quot; Referring to the Paus side of the family, Hedvig Ibsen remarked, &quot;we belong to a silent family,&quot; playfully echoing the similarity between &quot;taus&quot; (silent) and &quot;Paus.&quot; One of the Cudrio sisters from the neighboring farm, who knew Henrik Ibsen in childhood, said, &quot;he was immensely cunning and malicious, and he even beat us. But when he grew up, he became incredibly handsome, yet no one liked him because he was so malicious. No one wanted to be with him.&quot;

When Henrik Ibsen was around seven years old, his father&#x27;s fortunes took a turn for the worse, and in 1835 the family was forced to sell Altenburggården. The following year they moved to their stately summer home and farm, &quot;&quot;, outside of the city. They were still relatively affluent, had four servants, and socialised with other members of the Skien elite, e.g. through lavish parties; their closest neighbours on Southern Venstøp were former shipowner and mayor of Skien Ulrich Frederik Cudrio and his family, who also had been forced to sell their townhouse. In 1843, after Henrik left home, the Ibsen family moved to a townhouse at Snipetorp, owned by Knud Ibsen&#x27;s half-brother and former apprentice Christopher Blom Paus, who had established himself as an independent merchant in Skien in 1836 and who eventually became one of the city&#x27;s leading shipowners. Knud continued to struggle to maintain his business and had some success in the 1840s, but in the 1850s his business ventures and professional activities came to an end, and he became reliant on support from his successful younger half-brothers.

===Myths and reassessment===
Historically, Ibsen&#x27;s background was romanticized or dramatized to align with the mythos of the self-made genius. Early biographical accounts, like Henrik Jæger’s seminal biography, often emphasized a narrative of adversity: a descent from privilege into hardship, culminating in Ibsen’s artistic triumph. This interpretation positioned Ibsen’s works as expressions of personal struggle against societal and familial constraints, resonating with his broader critique of bourgeois morality. The depiction of Ibsen’s father as a failed merchant and tyrannical figure who fell into alcoholism, combined with the narrative of the family&#x27;s social decline, provided a lens through which many early scholars interpreted themes in Ibsen’s plays, such as financial ruin, family dysfunction, and hidden moral conflicts.

Modern scholarship frames Henrik Ibsen not as a self-made artist rising from hardship, but as a product of Norway&#x27;s patrician elite whose critique of society reflected his privileged yet transitional upbringing. Ibsen scholar Ellen Rees notes that historical and biographical research into Ibsen&#x27;s life in the 21st century has been marked by a &quot;revolution&quot; that has debunked numerous myths previously taken for granted. Older Ibsen historiography has often claimed that Knud Ibsen experienced financial ruin and became an alcoholic tyrant, that the family lost contact with the elite it had belonged to, and that this had a strong influence on Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s biography and work. Newer Ibsen scholarship—in particular Jon Nygaard&#x27;s book on Ibsen&#x27;s wider social milieu and ancestry and Jørgen Haave&#x27;s book &quot;The Ibsen Family&quot; (&quot;Familien Ibsen&quot;)—has refuted such claims, and Haave has pointed out that older biographical works have uncritically repeated numerous unfounded myths about both of Ibsen&#x27;s parents, and about the playwright&#x27;s childhood and background in general.

Haave points out that Knud Ibsen&#x27;s economic problems in the 1830s were mainly the result of the difficult times and something the Ibsen family had in common with most members of the bourgeoisie; Haave further argues that Henrik Ibsen had a happy and comfortable childhood as a member of the upper class, even after the family moved to Venstøp, and that they were able to maintain their lifestyle and patrician identity with the help of their extended family and accumulated cultural capital. Contrary to the incorrect claims that Ibsen had been born in a small or remote town, Haave points out that Skien had been Eastern Norway&#x27;s leading commercial city for centuries, and a centre of seafaring, timber exports, and early industrialization that had made Norway the developed and prosperous part of Denmark–Norway.

Rees characterizes Ibsen&#x27;s family as upper class rather than middle class, and part of &quot;the closest thing Norway had to an aristocracy, albeit one that lost most of its power during his lifetime.&quot; Ibsen scholar Jon Nygaard stated that Ibsen has an &quot;exceptional upper-class background&quot; and is a result of Norway being a wealthy country for a very long time. Haave points out that virtually all of Ibsen&#x27;s ancestors had been wealthy burghers and higher government officials, and members of the local and regional elites in the areas they lived, often of continental European ancestry. He argues that &quot;the Ibsen family belonged to an elite that distanced itself strongly from the common farmer population, and considered itself part of an educated European culture&quot; and that &quot;it was this patrician class that formed his cultural identity and upbringing.&quot; Haave points to many examples of both Henrik Ibsen and other members of his family having a condescending attitude towards common Norwegian farmers, viewing them as &quot;some sort of primitive indigenous population,&quot; and being very conscious of their own identity as members of the sophisticated upper class. Haave points out that Ibsen&#x27;s most immediate family—Knud, Marichen and Henrik&#x27;s siblings—disintegrated financially and socially in the 1850s, but that it happened after Henrik had left home, at a time when he was establishing himself as a successful man of theatre, while his extended family, such as his uncles Henrik Johan Paus, Christian Cornelius Paus and Christopher Blom Paus, were firmly established in Skien&#x27;s elite as lawyers, government officials and wealthy shipowners. Haave argues that the story of the Ibsen family is the story of the slow collapse of a patrician merchant family amid the emergence of a new democratic society in the 19th century, and that Henrik Ibsen, like others of his class, had to find new opportunities to maintain his social position. Nygaard summarized the revolution in the understanding of Ibsen&#x27;s childhood and background as all the popular notions about Ibsen being wrong.

===Literary influence of his childhood===
Many Ibsen scholars have compared characters and themes in his plays to his family and upbringing; his themes often deal with issues of financial difficulty as well as moral conflicts stemming from dark secrets hidden from society. Ibsen himself confirmed that he both modeled and named characters in his plays after his own family. Works such as &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, &quot;The Wild Duck&quot;, &quot;Rosmersholm&quot;, &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;, &quot;An Enemy of the People,&quot; and &quot;Ghosts&quot; include numerous references to Ibsen&#x27;s relatives, family history, and childhood memories. However, despite Ibsen&#x27;s use of his family as an inspiration for his plays, Haave criticizes the uncritical use of Ibsen&#x27;s dramas as biographical sources and the &quot;naive&quot; readings of them as literal representations of his family members, in particular his father.

===Overview of key figures===
Ibsen grew up in the tightly-knit extended family of the siblings Ole Paus and Hedevig Paus, his social paternal grandfather and biological maternal grandmother. His parents were socially considered first cousins. A blue background indicates that the person lived in Altenburg House. The silhouettes are from the family portrait in Altenburg House, circa 1820.





==Career==
===1846–1859: Grimstad years===
At fifteen, Ibsen left school. He moved to the small town of Grimstad to become an apprentice pharmacist. At that time he began writing plays. In 1846, when Ibsen was 18, he had a liaison with Else Sophie Jensdatter Birkedalen which produced a son, Hans Jacob Hendrichsen Birkdalen, whose upbringing Ibsen paid for until the boy was fourteen, though Ibsen never saw the child. Ibsen went to Christiania (later spelled Kristiania and then renamed Oslo) intending to matriculate at the university. He soon rejected the idea (his earlier attempts at entering university were blocked as he did not pass all his entrance exams), preferring to commit himself to writing. His first play, the tragedy &quot;Catilina&quot; (1850), was published under the pseudonym &quot;Brynjolf Bjarme&quot;, when he was only 22, but it was not performed. His first play to be staged, &quot;The Burial Mound&quot; (1850), received little attention. Still, Ibsen was determined to be a playwright, although the numerous plays he wrote in the following years remained unsuccessful. Ibsen&#x27;s main inspiration in the early period, right up to &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, was apparently the Norwegian author Henrik Wergeland and the Norwegian folk tales as collected by Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe. In Ibsen&#x27;s youth, Wergeland was the most acclaimed, and by far the most read, Norwegian poet and playwright. 

Ibsen spent the next several years employed at Det norske Theater (Bergen), where he was involved in the production of more than 145 plays as a writer, director, and producer. During this period, he published five new—though largely unremarkable—plays. Despite Ibsen&#x27;s failure to achieve success as a playwright, he gained a great deal of practical experience at the Norwegian Theater, experience that was to prove valuable when he continued writing. Ibsen returned to Christiania in 1858 to become the creative director of the Christiania Theatre. He married Suzannah Thoresen on 18 June 1858 and she gave birth to their only child Sigurd on 23 December 1859. The couple lived in difficult financial circumstances and Ibsen became very disenchanted with life in Norway.

===1864–1883: Established work and acclaim ===

In 1864, he left Christiania and went to Sorrento in Italy in self-imposed exile. He spent the next 27 years in Italy and Germany and only visited Norway a few times during those years. His next play, &quot;Brand&quot; (1865), brought him the critical acclaim he sought, along with a measure of financial success, as did the following play, &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; (1867), to which Edvard Grieg composed incidental music and songs. Although Ibsen read excerpts of the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard and traces of the latter&#x27;s influence are evident in &quot;Brand&quot;, it was not until after &quot;Brand&quot; that Ibsen came to take Kierkegaard seriously. Initially annoyed with his friend Georg Brandes for comparing Brand to Kierkegaard, Ibsen nevertheless read &quot;Either/Or&quot; and &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot;. Ibsen&#x27;s next play &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; was consciously informed by Kierkegaard. With success, Ibsen became more confident and began to introduce more and more of his own beliefs and judgements into the drama, exploring what he termed the &quot;drama of ideas&quot;. His next series of plays are often considered his Golden Age, when he entered the height of his power and influence, becoming the center of dramatic controversy across Europe.

Ibsen moved from Italy to Dresden, Germany, in 1868, where he spent years writing the play he regarded as his main work, &quot;Emperor and Galilean&quot; (1873), dramatizing the life and times of the Roman emperor Julian the Apostate. Although Ibsen himself always looked back on this play as the cornerstone of his entire works, very few shared his opinion, and his next works would be much more acclaimed. Ibsen moved to Munich in 1875 and began work on his first contemporary realist drama &quot;The Pillars of Society&quot;, first published and performed in 1877. &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; followed in 1879. This play is a scathing criticism of the marital roles accepted by men and women which characterized Ibsen&#x27;s society. Ibsen was already in his fifties when &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; was published. He himself saw his latter plays as a series. At the end of his career, he described them as &quot;that series of dramas which began with &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; and which is now completed with &quot;When We Dead Awaken&quot;&quot;. Furthermore, it was the reception of &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; which brought Ibsen international acclaim.

&quot;Ghosts&quot; followed in 1881, another scathing commentary on the morality of Ibsen&#x27;s society, in which a widow reveals to her pastor that she had hidden the evils of her marriage for its duration. The pastor had advised her to marry her fiancé despite his philandering, and she did so in the belief that her love would reform him. But his philandering continued right up until his death, and his vices are passed on to their son in the form of syphilis. The mention of venereal disease alone was scandalous, but to show how it could poison a respectable family was considered intolerable.

In &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot; (1882), Ibsen went even further. In earlier plays, controversial elements were important and even pivotal components of the action, but they were on the small scale of individual households. In &quot;An Enemy&quot;, controversy became the primary focus, and the antagonist was the entire community. One primary message of the play is that the individual, who stands alone, is more often &quot;right&quot; than the mass of people, who are portrayed as ignorant and sheeplike. Contemporary society&#x27;s belief was that the community was a noble institution that could be trusted, a notion Ibsen challenged. In &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;, Ibsen chastised not only the conservatism of society, but also the liberalism of the time. He illustrated how people on both sides of the social spectrum could be equally self-serving. &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot; was written as a response to the people who had rejected his previous work, &quot;Ghosts&quot;. The plot of the play is a veiled look at the way people reacted to the plot of &quot;Ghosts&quot;. The protagonist is a physician in a vacation spot whose primary draw is a public bath. The doctor discovers that the water is contaminated by the local tannery. He expects to be acclaimed for saving the town from the nightmare of infecting visitors with disease, but instead he is declared an &#x27;enemy of the people&#x27; by the locals, who band against him and even throw stones through his windows. The play ends with his complete ostracism. It is obvious to the reader that disaster is in store for the town as well as for the doctor.

As audiences by now expected, Ibsen&#x27;s next play again attacked entrenched beliefs and assumptions; but this time, his attack was not against society&#x27;s mores, but against overeager reformers and their idealism. Always an iconoclast, Ibsen saw himself as an objective observer of society, &quot;like a lone franc tireur in the outposts&quot;, playing a lone hand, as he put it. Ibsen, perhaps more than any of his contemporaries, relied upon immediate sources such as newspapers and second-hand report for his contact with intellectual thought. He claimed to be ignorant of books, leaving them to his wife and son, but, as Georg Brandes described, &quot;he seemed to stand in some mysterious correspondence with the fermenting, germinating ideas of the day.&quot;

=== 1884–1896: Later work ===
&quot;The Wild Duck&quot; (1884) is by many considered Ibsen&#x27;s finest work, and it is certainly one of the most complex, alongside &quot;Rosmersholm&quot;. When working on the play, Ibsen received his only visit from a relative during his decades in exile, when 21-year old (Count) Christopher Paus paid an extended visit to him in Rome. Jørgen Haave notes that Ibsen &quot;had not been this close to his own family since he left his hometown over 30 years ago,&quot; and he was eager to hear news from his family and hometown. Shortly after the visit Ibsen declared that he had overcome a writer&#x27;s block. The Wild Duck draws inspiration from Ibsen&#x27;s family and tells the story of Gregers Werle – described by Ibsen scholar Jon Nygaard as representing the spirit of the Paus family – a young man who returns to his hometown after an extended exile, and who is reunited with his boyhood friend Hjalmar Ekdal. Over the course of the play, the many secrets that lie behind the Ekdals&#x27; apparently happy home are revealed to Gregers, who insists on pursuing the absolute truth, or the &quot;Summons of the Ideal&quot;. Among these truths: Gregers&#x27; father impregnated his servant Gina, then married her off to Hjalmar to legitimize the child. Another man has been disgraced and imprisoned for a crime the elder Werle committed. Furthermore, while Hjalmar spends his days working on a wholly imaginary &quot;invention&quot;, his wife is earning the household income.

Ibsen displays masterly use of irony: despite his dogmatic insistence on truth, Gregers never says what he thinks but only insinuates, and is never understood until the play reaches its climax. Gregers hammers away at Hjalmar through innuendo and coded phrases until he realizes the truth: that Gina&#x27;s daughter, Hedvig, is not his child. Blinded by Gregers&#x27; insistence on absolute truth, Hjalmar disavows the child. Seeing the damage he has wrought, Gregers determines to repair things, and suggests to Hedvig that she sacrifice the wild duck, her wounded pet, to prove her love for Hjalmar. Hedvig, alone among the characters, recognizes that Gregers always speaks in code, and looking for the deeper meaning in the first important statement Gregers makes which does not contain one, kills herself rather than the duck in order to prove her love for him in the ultimate act of self-sacrifice. Only too late do Hjalmar and Gregers realize that the absolute truth of the &quot;ideal&quot; is sometimes too much for the human heart to bear.

Late in his career, Ibsen turned to a more introspective drama that had much less to do with denunciations of society&#x27;s moral values and more to do with the problems of individuals. In such later plays as &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; (1890) and &quot;The Master Builder&quot; (1892), Ibsen explored psychological conflicts that transcended a simple rejection of current conventions. Many modern readers, who might regard anti-Victorian didacticism as dated, simplistic or hackneyed, have found these later works to be of absorbing interest for their hard-edged, objective consideration of interpersonal confrontation. &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; and &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; are regularly cited as Ibsen&#x27;s most popular and influential plays, with the title role of Hedda regarded as one of the most challenging and rewarding for an actress even in the present day.

Ibsen had completely rewritten the rules of drama with a realism which was to be adopted by Chekhov and others, and which we see in the theatre to this day. From Ibsen forward, challenging assumptions and directly speaking about issues has been considered one of the factors that makes a play art rather than entertainment. His works were brought to an English-speaking audience, largely thanks to the efforts of William Archer and Edmund Gosse. These in turn had a profound influence on the young James Joyce who venerates Ibsen in his early autobiographical novel &quot;Stephen Hero&quot;. Ibsen returned to Norway in 1891, but it was in many ways not the Norway he had left. Indeed, he had played a major role in the changes that had happened across society. Modernism was on the rise, not only in the theatre, but across public life..

Ibsen intentionally obscured his influences. However, asked later what he had read when he wrote &quot;Catiline&quot;, Ibsen replied that he had read only the Danish Norse saga-inspired Romantic tragedian Adam Oehlenschläger and Ludvig Holberg, &quot;the Scandinavian Molière&quot;.

==Influences==
A major influence on Ibsen were Danish writers, such as Meïr Aron Goldschmidt and Georg Brandes, as well as his collaboration and friendship with the early Realist Swedish poet Carl Snoilsky. 

==Death and legacy ==

On 23 May 1906, Ibsen died in his home at Arbins gade 1 in Kristiania (now Oslo) after a series of strokes in March 1900. When, on 22 May, his nurse assured a visitor that he was a little better, Ibsen spluttered his last words &quot;On the contrary&quot; (&quot;Tvertimod!&quot;). He died the following day at 2:30 pm. Ibsen was buried in Vår Frelsers gravlund (&quot;The Graveyard of Our Savior&quot;) in central Oslo.

The 100th anniversary of Ibsen&#x27;s death in 2006 was commemorated with an &quot;Ibsen year&quot; in Norway and other countries. In 2006, the homebuilding company Selvaag also opened &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; Sculpture Park in Oslo, Norway, in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s honour, making it possible to follow the dramatic play &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; scene by scene. Will Eno&#x27;s adaptation of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, titled &quot;Gnit&quot;, had its world premiere at the 37th Humana Festival of New American Plays in March 2013. On 23 May 2006, The Ibsen Museum in Oslo re-opened to the public, with the house, where Ibsen had spent his last eleven years, completely restored with the original interior, colours, and decor.

Ivo de Figueiredo argues that &quot;today, Ibsen belongs to the world. But it is impossible to understand [Ibsen&#x27;s] path out there without knowing the Danish cultural sphere from which he sprang, from which he liberated himself and which he ended up shaping. Ibsen developed as a person and artist in a dialogue with Danish theater and literature that was anything but smooth.&quot; On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Ibsen&#x27;s death in 2006, the Norwegian government organised the Ibsen Year, which included celebrations around the world. The NRK produced a miniseries on Ibsen&#x27;s childhood and youth in 2006, &quot;An Immortal Man&quot;. Several prizes are awarded in his name, among them the International Ibsen Award, the Norwegian Ibsen Award, and the Ibsen Centennial Commemoration Award.
Every year, since 2008, the annual &quot;Delhi Ibsen Festival&quot;, is held in Delhi, India, organized by the Dramatic Art and Design Academy (DADA) in collaboration with The Royal Norwegian Embassy in India. It features plays by Ibsen, performed by artists from various parts of the world in varied languages and styles. The Ibsen Society of America (ISA) was founded in 1978 at the close of the Ibsen Sesquicentennial Symposium held in New York City to mark the 150th anniversary of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s birth. Distinguished Ibsen translator and critic Rolf Fjelde, Professor of Literature at Pratt Institute and the chief organizer of the Symposium, was elected Founding President. In December 1979, the ISA was certified as a non-profit corporation under the laws of the State of New York. Its purpose is to foster through lectures, readings, performances, conferences, and publications an understanding of Ibsen&#x27;s works as they are interpreted as texts and produced on stage and in film and other media. An annual newsletter, &quot;Ibsen News and Comment,&quot; is distributed to all members.

==Critical reception==

At the time when Ibsen was writing, literature was emerging as a formidable force in 19th century society. With the vast increase in literacy towards the end of the century, the possibilities of literature being used for subversion struck horror into the heart of the Establishment. Ibsen&#x27;s plays, from &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; onwards, caused an uproar—not just in Norway, but throughout Europe, and even across the Atlantic in America. No other artist, apart from Richard Wagner, had such an effect internationally, inspiring almost blasphemous adoration and hysterical abuse.

After the publication of &quot;Ghosts&quot;, he wrote: &quot;while the storm lasted, I have made many studies and observations and I shall not hesitate to exploit them in my future writings.&quot; Indeed, his next play, &quot;An Enemy of the People,&quot; was initially regarded by the critics to be simply his response to the violent criticism which had greeted &quot;Ghosts&quot;. Ibsen expected criticism; as he wrote to his publisher: &quot;&quot;Ghosts&quot; will probably cause alarm in some circles, but it can&#x27;t be helped. If it did not, there would have been no necessity for me to have written it.&quot;

Ibsen didn&#x27;t just read the critical reaction to his plays, he actively corresponded with critics, publishers, theatre directors, and newspaper editors on the subject. The interpretation of his work, both by critics and directors, concerned him greatly. He often advised directors on which actor or actress would be suitable for a particular role. An example of this is a letter he wrote to Hans Schroder in November 1884, with detailed instructions for the production of &quot;The Wild Duck&quot;.

Ibsen&#x27;s plays initially reached a far wider audience as read plays rather than in performance. It was 20 years, for instance, before the authorities would allow &quot;Ghosts&quot; to be performed in Norway. Each new play that Ibsen wrote, from 1879 onwards, had an explosive effect on intellectual circles. This was greatest for &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; and &quot;Ghosts&quot;, and it did lessen with the later plays, but the translation of Ibsen&#x27;s works into German, French, and English during the decade following the initial publication of each play—as well as frequent new productions as and when permission was granted—meant that Ibsen remained a topic of lively conversation throughout the latter decades of the 19th century. When &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; was published, it had an explosive effect: it was the centre of every conversation at every social gathering in Christiania. One hostess even wrote on the invitations to her soirée, &quot;You are politely requested not to mention Mr Ibsen&#x27;s new play&quot;.

Ibsen was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1902, 1903, and 1904.

Ibsen was also a key figure in Japanese drama and greatly influenced the Shingeki movement; Kunio Yanagita established the Ipusen-kai, an Ibsen Society in 1903, and shortly before Ibsen&#x27;s death, Hogetsu Shimamura declared an &quot;Age of Ibsen&quot; in Japan. Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Borkman&quot; was a particularly well received play with several contemporary translations, including one by Mori Ōgai. Amidst different schools of thought between Ōgai and Tsubouchi Shōyō over if respectively, Ibsen or Shakespeare would be best to bridge differences between Japanese and European theatre, the scholarly consensus has been that, &quot;Ibsen marked the birth of modern drama in Japan.&quot;

== Personal life ==
=== Ancestry ===
Ibsen&#x27;s ancestry has been a much studied subject, due to both his perceived foreignness and the influence of his biography and family on his plays. Ibsen often made references to his family in his plays, sometimes by name, or by modelling characters after them.

The oldest documented member of the Ibsen family was ship&#x27;s captain Rasmus Ibsen (1632–1703) from Stege, Denmark. His son, ship&#x27;s captain Peder Ibsen, became a burgher of Bergen in Norway in 1726. Henrik Ibsen had Danish, German, Norwegian, and some distant Scottish ancestry. Most of his ancestors belonged to the merchant class of original Danish and German extraction, and many of his ancestors were ship&#x27;s captains.

Ibsen&#x27;s biographer Henrik Jæger famously wrote in 1888 that Ibsen did not have a drop of Norwegian blood in his veins, stating that &quot;the ancestral Ibsen was a Dane&quot;. This, however, is not completely accurate; notably through his grandmother Hedevig Paus, Ibsen was descended from the Paus family, often considered one of the oldest families in Norway. Ibsen&#x27;s ancestors had mostly lived in Norway for several generations, even though many had foreign ancestry.

The name Ibsen is originally a patronymic, meaning &quot;son of Ib&quot; (Ib is a Danish variant of Jacob). The patronymic became &quot;frozen&quot;, i.e. it became a permanent family name, in the 17th century. The phenomenon of patronymics becoming frozen started in the 17th century in bourgeois families in Denmark, and the practice was only widely adopted in Norway from around 1900.

=== Descendants ===
From his marriage with Suzannah Thoresen, Ibsen had one son, lawyer, government minister, and Norwegian Prime Minister Sigurd Ibsen. Sigurd Ibsen married Bergljot Bjørnson, the daughter of Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. Their son was Tancred Ibsen, who became a film director and was married to Lillebil Ibsen; their only child was diplomat Tancred Ibsen, Jr. His male line together with the male-descended lines of the wider Ibsen family he belonged to will end with the deaths of Tancred Jr.&#x27;s two daughters. Sigurd Ibsen&#x27;s daughter, Irene Ibsen, married Josias Bille, a member of the Danish ancient noble Bille family; their son was Danish actor Joen Bille.
Ibsen had an illegitimate child early in his life, not entitled to the family name or inheritance. This line ended with his biological grandchildren. 

=== Political views ===
In a letter to George Brandes shortly before the Paris Commune, Ibsen expressed anarchist views that Brandes later positively related to the Paris Commune. Ibsen wrote that the state &quot;is the curse of the individual.… The state must be abolished.&quot; Brandes related that Ibsen &quot;presented to me as political ideals, conditions and ideas whose nature did not seem to me quite clear, but which were unquestionably akin to those that were proclaimed precisely one month later, in an extremely distorted form, by the Parisian commune.&quot; And in another letter shortly before the Commune came to an end, Ibsen expressed a disappointment with the Commune, insofar as it did not go far enough in its anarchism in its rejection of the state and private property. Ibsen wrote, &quot;Is it not impudent of the commune in Paris to go and destroy my admirable state theory, or rather no state theory? The idea is now ruined for a long time to come, and I cannot even set it forth in verse with any propriety.&quot; However, Ibsen nevertheless expressed an optimism, asserting that his &quot;no state theory&quot; bears &quot;within itself a healthy core&quot; and that some day &quot;it will be practised without any caricature.&quot;

<doc id="14240" wikidata="Q33569" url="?curid=14240" title="Hawaiian language">
<text>Hawaiian (&quot;&quot;, ) is a Polynesian language and critically endangered language of the Austronesian language family that takes its name from Hawaii, the largest island in the tropical North Pacific archipelago where it developed. Hawaiian, along with English, is an official language of the US state of Hawai&#x27;i. King Kamehameha III established the first Hawaiian-language constitution in 1839 and 1840.

In 1896, the Republic of Hawaii passed Act 57, an English-only law which subsequently banned Hawaiian language as the medium of instruction in publicly funded schools and promoted strict physical punishment for children caught speaking the Hawaiian language in schools. The Hawaiian language was not again allowed to be used as a medium of instruction in Hawai&#x27;i&#x27;s public schools until 1987, a span of 91 years. The number of native speakers of Hawaiian gradually decreased during the period from the 1830s to the 1950s. English essentially displaced Hawaiian on six of seven inhabited islands. In 2001, native speakers of Hawaiian amounted to less than 0.1% of the statewide population. 

Nevertheless, from around 1949 to the present day, there has been a gradual increase in attention to and promotion of the language. Public Hawaiian-language immersion preschools called Pūnana Leo were established in 1984; other immersion schools followed soon after that. The first students to start in immersion preschool have now graduated from college and many are fluent Hawaiian speakers. However, the language is still classified as critically endangered by UNESCO.

A creole language, Hawaiian Pidgin (or Hawaii Creole English, HCE), is more commonly spoken in Hawaii than Hawaiian. Some linguists, as well as many locals, argue that Hawaiian Pidgin is a dialect of American English. Born from the increase of immigrants from Japan, China, Puerto Rico, Korea, Portugal, Spain and the Philippines, the pidgin creole language was a necessity in the plantations. Hawaiian and immigrant laborers as well as the &quot;luna&quot;, or overseers, found a way to communicate among themselves. Pidgin eventually made its way off the plantation and into the greater community, where it is still used to this day.

==Name==
The Hawaiian language takes its name from the largest island in the Hawaiian archipelago, Hawaii (&quot;&quot; in the Hawaiian language). The island name was first written in English in 1778 by British explorer James Cook and his crew members. They wrote it as &quot;Owhyhee&quot; or &quot;Owhyee&quot;. It is written &quot;Oh-Why-hee&quot; on the first map of Sandwich Islands engraved by in 1781. Explorers Mortimer (1791) and Otto von Kotzebue (1821) used that spelling.

The initial &quot;O&quot; in the name &quot;Oh-Why-hee&quot; is a reflection of the fact that Hawaiian predicates unique identity by using a copula form, &quot;o&quot;, immediately before a proper noun. Thus, in Hawaiian, the name of the island is expressed by saying &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;[This] is Hawaii.&quot; The Cook expedition also wrote &quot;Otaheite&quot; rather than &quot;Tahiti&quot;.

The spelling &quot;why&quot; in the name reflects the pronunciation of &quot;wh&quot; in 18th-century English (still used in parts of the English-speaking world). &quot;Why&quot; was pronounced . The spelling &quot;hee&quot; or &quot;ee&quot; in the name represents the sounds , or .

Putting the parts together, &quot;O-why-(h)ee&quot; reflects , a reasonable approximation of the native pronunciation, .

American missionaries bound for Hawaii used the phrases &quot;Owhihe Language&quot; and &quot;Owhyhee language&quot; in Boston prior to their departure in October 1819 and during their five-month voyage to Hawaii. They still used such phrases as late as March 1822. However, by July 1823, they had begun using the phrase &quot;Hawaiian Language&quot;.

In Hawaiian, the language is called &quot;, since adjectives follow nouns.

==Family and origin==
Hawaiian is a Polynesian member of the Austronesian language family. It is closely related to other Polynesian languages, such as Samoan, Marquesan, Tahitian, Māori, Rapa Nui (the language of Easter Island) and Tongan.

According to Schütz (1994), the Marquesans colonized the archipelago in roughly 300 CE followed by later waves of immigration from the Society Islands and Samoa-Tonga. Their languages, over time, became the Hawaiian language within the Hawaiian Islands. Kimura and Wilson (1983) also state: Linguists agree that Hawaiian is closely related to Eastern Polynesian, with a particularly strong link in the Southern Marquesas, and a secondary link in Tahiti, which may be explained by voyaging between the Hawaiian and Society Islands.

=== Mutual intelligibility ===
Jack H. Ward (1962) conducted a study using basic words and short utterances to determine the level of comprehension between different Polynesian languages. The mutual intelligibility of Hawaiian was found to be 41.2% with Marquesan, 37.5% with Tahitian, 25.5% with Samoan and 6.4% with Tongan.

==History==
===First European contact===

In 1778, British explorer James Cook made Europe&#x27;s initial, recorded first contact with Hawaiʻi, beginning a new phase in the development of Hawaiian. During the next forty years, the sounds of Spanish (1789), Russian (1804), French (1816), and German (1816) arrived in Hawaii via other explorers and businessmen. Hawaiian began to be written for the first time, largely restricted to isolated names and words, and word lists collected by explorers and travelers.

The early explorers and merchants who first brought European languages to the Hawaiian islands also took on a few native crew members who brought the Hawaiian language into new territory. Hawaiians took these nautical jobs because their traditional way of life changed due to plantations, and although there were not enough of these Hawaiian-speaking explorers to establish any viable speech communities abroad, they still had a noticeable presence. One of them, a boy in his teens known as Obookiah (), had a major impact on the future of the language. He sailed to New England, where he eventually became a student at the Foreign Mission School in Cornwall, Connecticut. He inspired New Englanders to support a Christian mission to Hawaii, and provided information on the Hawaiian language to the American missionaries there prior to their departure for Hawaii in 1819. Adelbert von Chamisso too might have consulted with a native speaker of Hawaiian in Berlin, Germany, before publishing his grammar of Hawaiian (&quot;) in 1837.

====Folk tales====
Like all natural spoken languages, the Hawaiian language was originally an oral language. The native people of the Hawaiian language relayed religion, traditions, history, and views of their world through stories that were handed down from generation to generation. One form of storytelling most commonly associated with the Hawaiian islands is hula. Nathaniel B. Emerson notes that &quot;It kept the communal imagination in living touch with the nation&#x27;s legendary past&quot;.

The islanders&#x27; connection with their stories is argued to be one reason why Captain James Cook received a pleasant welcome. Marshall Sahlins has observed that Hawaiian folktales began bearing similar content to those of the Western world in the eighteenth century. He argues this was caused by the timing of Captain Cook&#x27;s arrival, which was coincidentally when the indigenous Hawaiians were celebrating the Makahiki festival, which is the annual celebration of the harvest in honor of the god Lono. The celebration lasts for the entirety of the rainy season. It is a time of peace with much emphasis on amusements, food, games, and dancing. The islanders&#x27; story foretold of the god Lono&#x27;s return at the time of the Makahiki festival.

===Written Hawaiian===

In 1820, Protestant missionaries from New England arrived in Hawaii, and in a few years converted the chiefs to Congregational Protestantism, who in turn converted their subjects. To the missionaries, the thorough Christianization of the kingdom necessitated a complete translation of the Bible to Hawaiian, a previously unwritten language, and therefore the creation of a standard spelling that should be as easy to master as possible. The orthography created by the missionaries was so straightforward that literacy spread very quickly among the adult population; at the same time, the Mission set more and more schools for children.
In 1834, the first Hawaiian-language newspapers were published by missionaries working with locals. The missionaries also played a significant role in publishing a vocabulary (1836), grammar (1854), and dictionary (1865) of Hawaiian. The Hawaiian Bible was fully completed in 1839; by then, the Mission had such a wide-reaching school network that, when in 1840 it handed it over to the Hawaiian government, the Hawaiian Legislature mandated compulsory state-funded education for all children under 14 years of age, including girls, twelve years before any similar compulsory education law was enacted for the first time in any of the United States.

Literacy in Hawaiian was so widespread that in 1842 a law mandated that people born after 1819 had to be literate to be allowed to marry. In his &quot;Report to the Legislature&quot; for the year 1853 Richard Armstrong, the minister of Public Instruction, bragged that 75% of the adult population could read. Use of the language among the general population might have peaked around 1881. Even so, some people worried, as early as 1854, that the language was &quot;soon destined to extinction.&quot;

When Hawaiian King David Kalākaua took a trip around the world, he brought his native language with him. When his wife, Queen Kapiolani, and his sister, Princess (later Queen) Liliuokalani, took a trip across North America and on to the British Islands, in 1887, Liliuokalani&#x27;s composition &quot;&quot; was already a famous song in the U.S.

===Suppression of Hawaiian===
The decline of the Hawaiian language was accelerated by the coup that overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy and dethroned the existing Hawaiian queen. Thereafter, a law was instituted that required English as the main language of school instruction. The law cited is identified as Act 57, sec. 30 of the 1896 Laws of the Republic of Hawaii:

This law established English as the medium of instruction for the government-recognized schools both &quot;public and private&quot;. While it did not ban or make illegal the Hawaiian language in other contexts, its implementation in the schools had far-reaching effects. Those who had been pushing for English-only schools took this law as licence to extinguish the native language at the early education level. While the law did not make Hawaiian illegal (it was still commonly spoken at the time), many children who spoke Hawaiian at school, including on the playground, were disciplined. This included corporal punishment and going to the home of the offending child to advise them strongly to stop speaking it in their home. Moreover, the law specifically provided for teaching languages &quot;in addition to the English language&quot;, reducing Hawaiian to the status of an extra language, subject to approval by the department. Hawaiian was not taught initially in any school, including the all-Hawaiian Kamehameha Schools. This is largely because when these schools were founded, like Kamehameha Schools founded in 1887 (nine years before this law), Hawaiian was being spoken in the home. Once this law was enacted, individuals at these institutions took it upon themselves to enforce a ban on Hawaiian. Beginning in 1900, Mary Kawena Pukui, who was later the co-author of the Hawaiian–English Dictionary, was punished for speaking Hawaiian by being rapped on the forehead, allowed to eat only bread and water for lunch, and denied home visits on holidays. Winona Beamer was expelled from Kamehameha Schools in 1937 for chanting Hawaiian. Due in part to this systemic suppression of the language after the overthrow, Hawaiian is still considered a critically endangered language.
However, informal coercion to drop Hawaiian would not have worked by itself. Just as important was the fact that, in the same period, native Hawaiians were becoming a minority in their own land on account of the growing influx of foreign labourers and their children. Whereas in 1890 pure Hawaiian students made 56% of school enrollment, in 1900 their numbers were down to 32% and, in 1910, to 16.9%. At the same time, Hawaiians were very prone to intermarriage: the number of &quot;Part-Hawaiian&quot; students (i.e., children of mixed White-Hawaiian marriages) grew from 1573 in 1890 to 3718 in 1910. In such mixed households, the low prestige of Hawaiian led to the adoption of English as the family language. Moreover, Hawaiians lived mostly in the cities or scattered across the countryside, in direct contact with other ethnic groups and without any stronghold (with the exception of Niʻihau). Thus, even pure Hawaiian children would converse daily with their schoolmates of diverse mother tongues in English, which was now not just the teachers&#x27; language but also the common language needed for everyday communication among friends and neighbours out of school as well. In only a generation English (or rather Pidgin) would become the primary and dominant language of all children, despite the efforts of Hawaiian and immigrant parents to maintain their ancestral languages within the family.

===1949 to present===
In 1949, the legislature of the Territory of Hawaii commissioned Mary Pukui and Samuel Elbert to write a new dictionary of Hawaiian, either revising the Andrews-Parker work or starting from scratch. Pukui and Elbert took a middle course, using what they could from the Andrews dictionary, but making certain improvements and additions that were more significant than a minor revision. The dictionary they produced, in 1957, introduced an era of gradual increase in attention to the language and culture.

Language revitalization and Hawaiian culture has seen a major revival since the Hawaiian renaissance in the 1970s. Forming in 1983, the ʻAha Pūnana Leo, meaning &quot;language nest&quot; in Hawaiian, opened its first center in 1984. It was a privately funded Hawaiian preschool program that invited native Hawaiian elders to speak to children in Hawaiian every day.

Efforts to promote the language have increased in recent decades. Hawaiian-language &quot;immersion&quot; schools are now open to children whose families want to reintroduce the Hawaiian language for future generations. The Aha Pūnana Leo&#x27;s Hawaiian language preschools in Hilo, Hawaii, have received international recognition. The local National Public Radio station features a short segment titled &quot;Hawaiian word of the day&quot; and a Hawaiian language news broadcast. Honolulu television station KGMB ran a weekly Hawaiian language program, &quot;Āhai Ōlelo Ola&quot;, as recently as 2010. Additionally, the Sunday editions of the &quot;Honolulu Star-Advertiser&quot;, the largest newspaper in Hawaii, feature a brief article called &quot;Kauakukalahale&quot; written entirely in Hawaiian by teachers, students, and community members.

Today, the number of native speakers of Hawaiian, which was under 0.1% of the statewide population in 1997, has risen to 2,000, out of 24,000 total who are fluent in the language, according to the US 2011 census. On six of the seven permanently inhabited islands, Hawaiian has been largely displaced by English, but on Niihau, native speakers of Hawaiian have remained fairly isolated and have continued to use Hawaiian almost exclusively.

===Niʻihau===
The isolated island of Niʻihau, located off the southwest coast of Kauai, is the one island where Hawaiian (more specifically a local dialect of Hawaiian known as Niihau dialect) is still spoken as the language of daily life. 
 states that &quot;[v]ariations in Hawaiian dialects have not been systematically studied&quot;, and that &quot;[t]he dialect of Niʻihau is the most aberrant and the one most in need of study&quot;. They recognized that Niʻihauans can speak Hawaiian in substantially different ways. Their statements are based in part on some specific observations made by . (See Hawaiian phonological processes)

Friction has developed between those on Niʻihau that speak Hawaiian as a first language, and those who speak Hawaiian as a second language, especially those educated by the College of Hawaiian Language at the University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo. The university sponsors a Hawaiian Language Lexicon Committee () which coins words for concepts that historically have not existed in the language, like &quot;computer&quot; and &quot;cell phone&quot;. These words are generally not incorporated into the Niʻihau dialect, which often coins its own words organically. Some new words are Hawaiianized versions of English words, and some are composed of Hawaiian roots and unrelated to English sounds.

== Hawaiian in schools ==
=== Hawaiian medium schools ===
The Hawaiian medium education system is a combination of charter, public, and private schools. K–6 schools operate under coordinated governance of the Department of Education and the charter school, while the pre-K–12 laboratory system is governed by the Department of Education, the ʻAha Pūnana Leo, and the charter school. Over 80% of graduates from these laboratory schools attend college, some of which include Ivy-League schools. Hawaiian is now an authorized course in the Department of Education language curriculum, though not all schools offer the language.

There are two kinds of Hawaiian-immersion medium schools: K–12 total Hawaiian-immersion schools, and grades 7–12 partial Hawaiian immersion schools, the latter having some classes are taught in English and others are taught in Hawaiian. One of the main focuses of Hawaiian-medium schools is to teach the form and structure of the Hawaiian language by modeling sentences as a &quot;pepeke&quot;, meaning squid in Hawaiian. In this case the pepeke is a metaphor that features the body of a squid with the three essential parts: the poʻo (head), the ʻawe (tentacles) and the piko (where the poʻo and ʻawe meet) representing how a sentence is structured. The poʻo represents the predicate, the piko representing the subject and the ʻawe representing the object. Hawaiian immersion schools teach content that both adheres to state standards and stresses Hawaiian culture and values. The existence of immersion schools in Hawaiʻi has developed the opportunity for intergenerational transmission of Hawaiian at home.

=== Higher education ===
The Ka Haka ʻUla O Keʻelikōlani College of Hawaiian Language is a college at the University of Hawaii at Hilo dedicated to providing courses and programs entirely in Hawaiian. It educates and provides training for teachers and school administrators of Hawaiian medium schools. It is the only college in the United States of America that offers a master&#x27;s and doctorate&#x27;s degree in an Indigenous language. Programs offered at The Ka Haka ʻUla O Keʻelikōlani College of Hawaiian Language are known collectively as the &quot;Hilo model&quot; and has been imitated by the Cherokee immersion program and several other Indigenous revitalization programs.

Since 1921, the University of Hawaiʻi at Manoa and all of the University of Hawaiʻi Community Colleges also offer Hawaiian language courses to students for credit. The university now also offers free online courses not for credit, along with a few other websites and apps such as Duolingo.

==Orthography ==

Hawaiians had no written language prior to Western contact, except for petroglyph symbols.
The modern Hawaiian alphabet, &quot;ka pīāpā Hawaii&quot;, is based on the Latin script. Hawaiian words end &quot;only&quot; in vowels, and every consonant must be followed by a vowel. The Hawaiian alphabetical order has all of the vowels before the consonants, as in the following chart.
===Origin===
This writing system was developed by American Protestant missionaries during 1820–1826. It was the first thing they ever printed in Hawaii, on January 7, 1822, and it originally included the consonants &quot;B, D, R, T,&quot; and &quot;V,&quot; in addition to the current ones (&quot;H, K, L, M, N, P, W&quot;), and it had &quot;F, G, S, Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; for &quot;spelling foreign words&quot;. The initial printing also showed the five vowel letters (&quot;A, E, I, O, U&quot;) and seven of the short diphthongs (&quot;AE, AI, AO, AU, EI, EU, OU&quot;).

In 1826, the developers voted to eliminate some of the letters which represented functionally redundant allophones (called &quot;interchangeable letters&quot;), enabling the Hawaiian alphabet to approach the ideal state of one-symbol-one-phoneme, and thereby optimizing the ease with which people could teach and learn the reading and writing of Hawaiian. For example, instead of spelling one and the same word as &quot;pule, bule, pure,&quot; and &quot;bure&quot; (because of interchangeable &quot;p/b&quot; and &quot;l/r&quot;), the word is spelled only as &quot;pule&quot;.
* Interchangeable B/P. &quot;B&quot; was dropped, &quot;P&quot; was kept.
* Interchangeable L/R. &quot;R&quot; and &quot;D&quot; were dropped, &quot;L&quot; was kept.
* Interchangeable K/T. &quot;T&quot; was dropped, &quot;K&quot; was kept.
* Interchangeable V/W. &quot;V&quot; was dropped, &quot;W&quot; was kept.

However, hundreds of words were very rapidly borrowed into Hawaiian from English, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, and Syriac. Although these loan words were necessarily Hawaiianized, they often retained some of their &quot;non-Hawaiian letters&quot; in their published forms. For example, &quot;Brazil&quot; fully Hawaiianized is &quot;Palakila&quot;, but retaining &quot;foreign letters&quot; it is &quot;Barazila&quot;. Another example is &quot;Gibraltar&quot;, written as &quot;Kipalaleka&quot; or &quot;Gibaraleta&quot;. While and are not regarded as Hawaiian sounds, , , and were represented in the original alphabet, so the letters (&quot;b&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, and &quot;t&quot;) for the latter are not truly &quot;non-Hawaiian&quot; or &quot;foreign&quot;, even though their post-1826 use in published matter generally marked words of foreign origin.

===Glottal stop===

&quot;ʻOkina&quot; (&quot;oki&quot; &#x27;cut&#x27; + &quot;-na&quot; &#x27;-ing&#x27;) is the modern Hawaiian name for the symbol (a letter) that represents the glottal stop. It was formerly known as &quot;uina&quot; (&quot;snap&quot;).

For examples of the okina, consider the Hawaiian words &quot;Hawaii&quot; and &quot;Oahu&quot; (often simply &quot;Hawaii&quot; and &quot;Oahu&quot; in English orthography). In Hawaiian, these words are pronounced and , and are written with an okina where the glottal stop is pronounced.

Elbert &amp; Pukui&#x27;s &quot;Hawaiian Grammar&quot; says &quot;The glottal stop, codice_1, is made by closing the glottis or space between the vocal cords, the result being something like the hiatus in English &quot;oh-oh&quot;.&quot;

====History====
As early as 1823, the missionaries made some limited use of the apostrophe to represent the glottal stop, but they did not make it a letter of the alphabet. In publishing the Hawaiian Bible, they used it to distinguish &quot;kou&quot; (&#x27;my&#x27;) from &quot;kou&quot; (&#x27;your&#x27;). In 1864, William DeWitt Alexander published a grammar of Hawaiian in which he made it clear that the glottal stop (calling it &quot;guttural break&quot;) is definitely a true consonant of the Hawaiian language. He wrote it using an apostrophe. In 1922, the Andrews-Parker dictionary of Hawaiian made limited use of the opening single quote symbol, then called &quot;reversed apostrophe&quot; or &quot;inverse comma&quot;, to represent the glottal stop. Subsequent dictionaries and written material associated with the Hawaiian language revitalization have preferred to use this symbol, the &quot;okina&quot;, to better represent spoken Hawaiian. Nonetheless, excluding the &quot;okina&quot; may facilitate interface with English-oriented media, or even be preferred stylistically by some Hawaiian speakers, in homage to 19th century written texts. So there is variation today in the use of this symbol.

====Electronic encoding====

The okina is written in various ways for electronic uses:
* turned comma: , Unicode hex value 02BB (decimal 699). This does not always have the correct appearance because it is not supported in some fonts.
* opening single quote, a.k.a. left single quotation mark: ‘ Unicode hex value 2018 (decimal 8216). In many fonts this character looks like either a left-leaning single quotation mark or a quotation mark thicker at the bottom than at the top. In more traditional serif fonts such as Times New Roman it can look like a very small &quot;6&quot; with the circle filled in black: ‘.

Because many people who want to write the ʻokina are not familiar with these specific characters and/or do not have access to the appropriate fonts and input and display systems, it is sometimes written with more familiar and readily available characters:

===Macron===
A modern Hawaiian name for the macron symbol is &quot;kahakō&quot; (&quot;kaha&quot; &#x27;mark&#x27; + &quot;kō&quot; &#x27;long&#x27;). It was formerly known as &quot;mekona&quot; (Hawaiianization of &quot;macron&quot;). It can be written as a diacritical mark which looks like a hyphen or dash written above a vowel, i.e., &quot;ā ē ī ō ū&quot; and &quot;Ā Ē Ī Ō Ū&quot;. It is used to show that the marked vowel is a &quot;double&quot;, or &quot;geminate&quot;, or &quot;long&quot; vowel, in phonological terms. (See: Vowel length)

As early as 1821, at least one of the missionaries, Hiram Bingham, was using macrons (and breves) in making handwritten transcriptions of Hawaiian vowels. The missionaries specifically requested their sponsor in Boston to send them some type (fonts) with accented vowel characters, including vowels with macrons, but the sponsor made only one response and sent the wrong font size (pica instead of small pica). Thus, they could not print ā, ē, ī, ō, nor ū (at the right size), even though they wanted to.

===Pronunciation===
Owing to extensive allophony, Hawaiian has more than 13 phones. Although vowel length is phonemic, long vowels are not always pronounced as such, even though under the rules for assigning stress in Hawaiian, a long vowel will always receive stress.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===

Hawaiian is known for having very few consonant phonemes – eight: . It is notable that Hawaiian has allophonic variation of with , with , and (in some dialects) with . The – variation is quite unusual among the world&#x27;s languages, and is likely a product both of the small number of consonants in Hawaiian, and the recent shift of historical *t to modern –, after historical *k had shifted to . In some dialects, remains as in some words. These variations are largely free, though there are conditioning factors. tends to especially in words with both and , such as in the island name &quot;Lānai&quot; (–), though this is not always the case: &quot;eleele&quot; or &quot;eneene&quot; &quot;black&quot;. The allophone is almost universal at the beginnings of words, whereas is most common before the vowel . is also the norm after and , whereas is usual after and . After and initially, however, and are in free variation.

===Vowels===
Hawaiian has five short and five long vowels, plus diphthongs.

====Monophthongs====
Hawaiian has five pure vowels. The short vowels are , and the long vowels, if they are considered separate phonemes rather than simply sequences of like vowels, are . When stressed, short and have been described as becoming and , while when unstressed they are and . Parker Jones (2017), however, did not find a reduction of /a/ to outside of function words in the phonetic analysis of a young speaker from Hilo, Hawaiʻi, who had been raised within the Hawaiian language revitalisation movement; so there is at least some variation in how /a/ is realised. also tends to become next to , , and another , as in &quot;Pele&quot; . Some grammatical particles vary between short and long vowels. These include &quot;a&quot; and &quot;o&quot; &quot;of&quot;, &quot;ma&quot; &quot;at&quot;, &quot;na&quot; and &quot;no&quot; &quot;for&quot;. Between a back vowel or and a following non-back vowel (), there is an epenthetic , which is generally not written. Between a front vowel or and a following non-front vowel (), there is an epenthetic (a &quot;y&quot; sound), which is never written.

====Diphthongs====
The short-vowel diphthongs are . In all except perhaps , these are falling diphthongs. However, they are not as tightly bound as the diphthongs of English, and may be considered vowel sequences. (The second vowel in such sequences may receive the stress, but in such cases it is not counted as a diphthong.) In fast speech, tends to and tends to , conflating these diphthongs with and .

There are only a limited number of vowels which may follow long vowels, and some authors treat these sequences as diphthongs as well: .

===Phonotactics===
Hawaiian syllable structure is (C)V. All CV syllables occur except for &quot;wū&quot;; &quot;wu&quot; occurs only in two words borrowed from English. As shown by Schütz, Hawaiian word-stress is predictable in words of one to three moras, but not in words of five or more syllables. Hawaiian phonological processes include palatalization and deletion of consonants, as well as raising, diphthongization, deletion, and compensatory lengthening of vowels.

===Historical development===
Historically, glottal stop developed from *k. Loss of intervocalic consonant phonemes has resulted in Hawaiian long vowels and diphthongs.

==Grammar==

Hawaiian is an analytic language with verb–subject–object word order. While there is no use of inflection for verbs, in Hawaiian, like other Austronesian personal pronouns, declension is found in the differentiation between a- and o-class genitive case personal pronouns in order to indicate inalienable possession in a binary possessive class system. Also like many Austronesian languages, Hawaiian pronouns employ separate words for inclusive and exclusive we (clusivity), and distinguish singular, dual, and plural. The grammatical function of verbs is marked by adjacent particles (short words) and by their relative positions, that indicate tense–aspect–mood.

Some examples of verb phrase patterns:
* &quot;ua&quot; – perfective
* &quot;e&quot; &quot;ana&quot; – imperfective
* &quot;ke&quot; &quot;nei&quot; – present progressive
* &quot;e&quot; – imperative
* &quot;mai&quot; – negative imperative
* &quot;i&quot; – purposive
* &quot;ke&quot; – infinitive

Nouns can be marked with articles:
* &quot;ka honu&quot; (the turtle)
* &quot;nā honu&quot; (the turtles)
* &quot;ka hale&quot; (the house)
* &quot;ke kanaka&quot; (the person)

&quot;ka&quot; and &quot;ke&quot; are singular definite articles. &quot;ke&quot; is used before words beginning with a-, e-, o- and k-, and with some words beginning - and p-. &quot;ka&quot; is used in all other cases. &quot;nā&quot; is the plural definite article.

To show part of a group, the word &quot;kekahi&quot; is used. To show a bigger part, &quot;mau&quot; is inserted to pluralize the subject.

Examples:
* &quot;kekahi pipi&quot; (one of the cows)
* &quot;kekahi mau pipi&quot; (some of the cows)

=== Semantic domains ===
Hawaiian has thousands of words for elements of the natural world. According to the Hawaiian Electronic Library, there are thousands of names for different types of wind, rain, parts of the sea, peaks of mountains, and sky formations, demonstrating the importance of the natural world to Hawaiian culture. For example, &quot;Hoʻomalumalu&quot; means &quot;sheltering cloud&quot; and &quot;Hoʻoweliweli&quot; means &quot;threatening cloud&quot;.

== Varieties and debates ==
There is a marked difference between varieties of the Hawaiian language spoken by most native Hawaiian elders and the Hawaiian Language taught in education, sometimes regarded as &quot;University Hawaiian&quot; or &quot;College Hawaiian&quot;. &quot;University Hawaiian&quot; is often so different from the language spoken by elders that Native Hawaiian children may feel scared or ashamed to speak Hawaiian at home, limiting the language&#x27;s domains to academia. Language varieties spoken by elders often includes Pidgin Hawaiian, Hawaiian Pidgin, Hawaiian-infused English, or another variety of Hawaiian that is much different from the &quot;University Hawaiian&quot; that was standardized and documented by colonists in the 19th century.

The divide between &quot;University Hawaiian&quot; and varieties spoken by elders has created debate over which variety of Hawaiian should be considered &quot;real&quot; or &quot;authentic&quot;, as neither &quot;University Hawaiian&quot; nor other varieties spoken by elders are free from foreign interference. Hawaiian cultural beliefs of divine intervention as the driving force of language formation expedites distrust in what might be seen as the mechanical nature of colonial linguistic paradigms of language and its role in the standardized variety of &quot;University Hawaiian&quot;. Hawaiian&#x27;s authenticity debate could have major implications for revitalization efforts as language attitudes and trends in existing language domains are both UNESCO factors in assessing a language&#x27;s level of endangerment.

<text>The Second Polish Republic, at the time officially known as the Republic of Poland, was a country in Central and Eastern Europe that existed between 7 October 1918 and 6 October 1939. The state was established in the final stage of World War I. The Second Republic ceased to exist in 1939, after Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and the Slovak Republic, marking the beginning of the European theatre of the Second World War. The Polish government-in-exile was established in Paris and later London after the fall of France in 1940.

When, after several regional conflicts, most importantly the victorious Polish-Soviet war, the borders of the state were finalized in the year 1922, Poland&#x27;s neighbours were Czechoslovakia, Germany, the Free City of Danzig, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania and the Soviet Union. It had access to the Baltic Sea via a short strip of coastline known as the Polish Corridor on either side of the city of Gdynia. Between March and August 1939, Poland also shared a border with the then-Hungarian governorate of Subcarpathia. In 1938, the Second Republic was the sixth largest country in Europe. According to the 1921 census, the number of inhabitants was 25.7 million. By 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II, this had grown to an estimated 35.1 million. Almost a third of the population came from minority groups: 13.9% Ukrainians; 10% Ashkenazi Jews; 3.1% Belarusians; 2.3% Germans and 3.4% Czechs and Lithuanians. At the same time, a significant number of ethnic Poles lived outside the country&#x27;s borders.

The Second Republic maintained moderate economic development. The cultural hubs of interwar PolandWarsaw, Kraków, Poznań, Wilno, and Lwówbecame major European cities and the sites of internationally acclaimed universities and other institutions of higher education. Although Polish Jews were some of the biggest supporters of Second Republic leader Józef Piłsudski, even after he returned to politics and staged a coup in 1926, after his death in 1935 Pilsudskites ruling the Republic began to openly discriminate against its Jewish (and, to a lesser extent, its Ukrainian) citizens, restricting Jewish entry into professions and placing limitations on Jewish businesses.

==Name==
The official name of the state was the &quot;Republic of Poland&quot;. In the Polish language, it was referred to as &quot;Rzeczpospolita Polska&quot; (abbr. &quot;RP&quot;), with the term &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot; being a traditional name for the &quot;republic&quot; when referring to various Polish states, including the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (considered to be the First Polish Republic, &quot;Pierwsza Rzeczpospolita&quot;), and later, the current Third Polish Republic. In other regionally-used official languages, the state was referred to as: &quot;Republik Polen&quot; in German, &quot;Польська Республіка&quot; (transcription: &quot;Polʹsʹka Respublika&quot;) in Ukrainian, &quot;Польская Рэспубліка&quot; (transcription: &quot;Poĺskaja Respublika&quot;) in Belarusian, and &quot;Lenkijos Respublika&quot;, in Lithuanian.

Between 14 November 1918 and 13 March 1919, the state was referred to in Polish as &quot;Republika Polska&quot;, instead of &quot;Rzeczpospolita Polska&quot;. Both terms mean the &quot;Republic&quot;; however, &quot;republika&quot; is a general term, while &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot; traditionally refers exclusively to Polish states. Additionally, between 8 November 1918 and 16 August 1919, the &quot;Journal of Laws of the State of Poland&quot; referred to the country as the &quot;State of Poland&quot; (Polish: &quot;Państwo Polskie&quot;).

Following the end of the Second World War, and the establishment of the later states of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic and the Third Polish Republic, the historical state is referred to as the &quot;Second Polish Republic&quot;. In the Polish language, the country is traditionally referred to as &quot;II Rzeczpospolita&quot; (&quot;Druga Rzeczpospolita&quot;), which means the &quot;Second Republic&quot;.

==Background==
After more than a century of partitions between the Austrian, the Prussian, and the Russian imperial powers, Poland re-emerged as a sovereign state at the end of the First World War in Europe in 1917–1918. The victorious Allies of the First World War confirmed the rebirth of Poland in the Treaty of Versailles of June 1919. It was one of the great stories of the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. Poland solidified its independence in a series of border wars fought by the newly formed Polish Army from 1918 to 1921. The extent of the eastern half of the interwar territory of Poland was settled diplomatically in 1922 and internationally recognised by the League of Nations.

===End of the First World War===
Over the course of the First World War (1914–1918), the German Empire gradually dominated the Eastern Front as the Imperial Russian Army fell back. German and Austro-Hungarian armies seized the Russian-ruled part of what became Poland. In a failed attempt to resolve the Polish question as quickly as possible, Berlin set up the puppet Kingdom of Poland on 14 January 1917, with a governing Provisional Council of State and (from 15 October 1917) a Regency Council (&quot;Rada Regencyjna Królestwa Polskiego&quot;). The Council administered the country under German auspices (see also Mitteleuropa), pending the election of a king. More than a month before Germany surrendered on 11 November 1918 and the war ended, the Regency Council had dissolved the Provisional Council of State and announced its intention to restore Polish independence (7 October 1918). With the notable exception of the Marxist-oriented Social Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (&quot;SDKPiL&quot;), most Polish political parties supported this move. On 23 October the Regency Council appointed a new government under Józef Świeżyński and began conscription into the Polish Army.

===Formation of the Republic===
In 1918–1919, over 100 workers&#x27; councils sprang up on Polish territories; on 5 November 1918, in Lublin, the first Soviet of Delegates was established. On 6 November socialists proclaimed the Republic of Tarnobrzeg at Tarnobrzeg in Austrian Galicia. The same day the Socialist, Ignacy Daszyński, set up a Provisional People&#x27;s Government of the Republic of Poland (&quot;Tymczasowy Rząd Ludowy Republiki Polskiej&quot;) in Lublin. On Sunday, 10 November at 7 a.m., Józef Piłsudski, newly freed from 16 months in a German prison in Magdeburg, returned by train to Warsaw. Piłsudski, together with Colonel Kazimierz Sosnkowski, was greeted at Warsaw&#x27;s railway station by Regent Zdzisław Lubomirski and by Colonel Adam Koc. Next day, due to his popularity and support from most political parties, the Regency Council appointed Piłsudski as Commander in Chief of the Polish Armed Forces. On 14 November, the Council dissolved itself and transferred all its authority to Piłsudski as Chief of State (&quot;Naczelnik Państwa&quot;). After consultation with Piłsudski, Daszyński&#x27;s government dissolved itself and a new government formed under Jędrzej Moraczewski. In 1918, the Kingdom of Italy became the first country in Europe to recognise Poland&#x27;s renewed sovereignty.
Centres of government that formed at that time in Galicia (formerly Austrian-ruled southern Poland) included the National Council of the Principality of Cieszyn (established in November 1918), the Republic of Zakopane and the Polish Liquidation Committee (28 October). Soon afterward, the Polish–Ukrainian War broke out in Lwów (1 November 1918) between forces of the Military Committee of Ukrainians and the Polish irregular units made up of students known as the Lwów Eaglets, who were later supported by the Polish Army (see Battle of Lwów (1918), Battle of Przemyśl (1918)). Meanwhile, in western Poland, another war of national liberation began under the banner of the Greater Poland uprising (1918–1919). In January 1919, Czechoslovak forces attacked Polish units in the area of Trans-Olza (see Polish–Czechoslovak War). Soon afterwards, the Polish–Lithuanian War (ca 1919–1920) began, and, in August 1919, Polish-speaking residents of Upper Silesia initiated a series of three Silesian Uprisings. The most critical military conflict of that period, however, the Polish–Soviet War (1919-1921), ended in a decisive Polish victory.

==Politics and government==
The Second Polish Republic was a parliamentary democracy from 1919 (see Small Constitution of 1919) to 1926, with the President having limited powers. The Parliament elected him, and he could appoint the Prime Minister as well as the government with the &quot;Sejm&quot;&#x27;s (lower house&#x27;s) approval, but he could only dissolve the &quot;Sejm&quot; with the Senate&#x27;s consent. Moreover, his power to pass decrees was limited by the requirement that the Prime Minister and the appropriate other Minister had to verify his decrees with their signatures. Poland was one of the first countries in the world to recognise women&#x27;s suffrage. Women in Poland were granted the right to vote on 28 November 1918 by a decree of General Józef Piłsudski.

The major political parties at this time were the Polish Socialist Party, National Democrats, various Peasant Parties, Christian Democrats, and political groups of ethnic minorities (German: German Social Democratic Party of Poland, Jewish: General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland, United Jewish Socialist Workers Party, and Ukrainian: Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance). Frequently changing governments (see 1919 Polish legislative election, 1922 Polish legislative election) and other negative publicity the politicians received (such as accusations of corruption or the 1919 Polish coup attempt), made them increasingly unpopular. Major politicians at this time, in addition to General Piłsudski, included peasant activist Wincenty Witos (Prime Minister three times) and right-wing leader Roman Dmowski. Ethnic minorities were represented in the &quot;Sejm&quot;; e.g. in 1928 – 1930 there was the Ukrainian-Belarusian Club, with 26 Ukrainian and 4 Belarusian members.
After the Polish–Soviet War, Marshal Piłsudski led an intentionally modest life, writing historical books for a living. After he took power through a military coup in May 1926, he emphasised that he wanted to heal Polish society and politics of excessive partisan politics. His regime, accordingly, was called &quot;Sanacja&quot; in Polish. The 1928 parliamentary elections were still considered free and fair, although the pro-Piłsudski Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government won them. The following three parliamentary elections (in 1930, 1935 and 1938) were manipulated, with opposition activists sent to Bereza Kartuska prison (see also Brest trials). As a result, the pro-government party Camp of National Unity won huge majorities in them. Piłsudski died just after an authoritarian constitution was approved in the spring of 1935. During the last four years of the Second Polish Republic, the major politicians included President Ignacy Mościcki, Foreign Minister Józef Beck and the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army, Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły. The country was divided into 104 electoral districts, and those politicians who were forced to leave Poland founded Front Morges in 1936. The government that ruled the Second Polish Republic in its final years is frequently referred to as Piłsudski&#x27;s colonels.
===Military===
Interwar Poland had a large army of 270,000 soldiers on active duty: in 37 infantry divisions, 11 cavalry brigades, and two armored brigades, plus artillery units. Another 700,000 men served in the reserves. At the outbreak of the war, the Polish Army was able to put in the field almost one million soldiers, 4,300 guns, around 1,000 armored vehicles including in between 200 and 300 tanks (the majority of the armored vehicles were outclassed tankettes) and 745 aircraft (however, only around 450 of them were bombers and fighters available to fight as of 1 September 1939).

The training of the Polish Army was thorough. The non-commissioned officers were a competent body of men with expert knowledge and high ideals. The officers, both senior and junior, constantly refreshed their training in the field and in the lecture hall, where modern technical achievement and the lessons of contemporary wars were demonstrated and discussed. The equipment of the Polish Army was less developed technically than that of Nazi Germany and its rearmament was slowed by confidence in Western European military support and by budget difficulties. The Polish command system at the level of the entire Polish military and the armies was obsolete. The generals in command of armies had to ask permission from the high command. The Polish military attempted to organize fronts made of army groups only when it was already too late during the Polish Defensive War in 1939.

==Economy==

After regaining its independence, Poland was faced with major economic difficulties. In addition to the devastation brought by the First World War, the exploitation of the Polish economy by the German and Russian occupying powers, and the sabotage performed by retreating armies, the new republic was faced with the task of economically unifying disparate economic regions, which had previously been part of different countries and different empires. Within the borders of the Republic were the remnants of three different economic systems, with five different currencies (the German mark, the Imperial Russian rouble, the Austrian krone, the Polish marka and the Ostrubel) and with little or no direct infrastructural links. The situation was so bad that neighbouring industrial centres, as well as major cities, lacked direct railway links because they had been parts of different jurisdictions and different empires. For example, there was no direct railway connection between Warsaw and Kraków until 1934. This situation was described by Melchior Wańkowicz in his book &quot;Sztafeta&quot;.

In addition to this was the massive destruction left after both the First World War and the Polish–Soviet War. There was also a great economic disparity between the eastern (commonly called &quot;Poland B&quot;) and western (called &quot;Poland A&quot;) parts of the country, with the western half, especially areas that had belonged to Prussia and the German Empire, being much more developed and prosperous. Frequent border closures and a customs war with Germany also had negative economic impacts on Poland. In 1924, Prime Minister Władysław Grabski, who was also the Economic Minister, introduced the &quot;złoty&quot; as a single common currency for Poland (replacing the marka), which remained a stable currency. The currency helped Poland to control the massive hyperinflation. It was the only country in Europe able to do this without foreign loans or aid. The average annual growth rate (GDP per capita) was 5.24% in 1920–29 and 0.34% in 1929–38.
Hostile relations with neighbours were a major problem for the economy of interbellum Poland. In the year 1937, foreign trade with all neighbours amounted to only 21% of Poland&#x27;s total. Trade with Germany, Poland&#x27;s most important neighbour, accounted for 14.3% of Polish exchange. Foreign trade with the Soviet Union (0.8%) was virtually nonexistent. Czechoslovakia accounted for 3.9%, Latvia for 0.3%, and Romania for 0.8%. By mid-1938, after the &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Austria, Greater Germany was responsible for as much as 23% of Polish foreign trade.
Piłsudski&#x27;s regime followed the conservative free-market economic tradition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth throughout its existence. Poland had one of the lowest taxation rates in Europe, with 9.3% of taxes as a distribution of national income. Piłsudski&#x27;s regime was also heavily dependent on foreign investments and economies, with 45.4% of Polish equity capital controlled by foreign corporations. After the Great Depression, the Polish economy crumbled and failed to recover until Ignacy Mościcki&#x27;s government introduced economic reforms with more government interventions with an increase in tax revenues and public spending after Piłsudski&#x27;s death. These interventionist policies saw Poland&#x27;s economy recover from the recession.

The basis of Poland&#x27;s gradual recovery after the Great Depression was the mass economic development plans of the new government (see Four Year Plan) under economist Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, which oversaw the building of three key infrastructural elements. The first was the establishment of the Gdynia seaport, which allowed Poland to completely bypass Gdańsk (which was under heavy German pressure to boycott Polish coal exports). The second was construction of the 500-kilometre rail connection between Upper Silesia and Gdynia, called the Polish Coal Trunk-Line, which served freight trains with coal. The third was the creation of a central industrial district named COP – &quot;Centralny Okręg Przemysłowy&quot; (English: Central Industrial Region). Unfortunately, these developments were interrupted and largely destroyed by the German and Soviet invasion and the start of the Second World War. Other achievements of interbellum Poland included Stalowa Wola (a brand new city, built in a forest around a steel mill), Mościce (now a district of Tarnów, with a large nitrate factory), and the creation of the central bank Bank Polski SA. There were several trade fairs, with the most popular being Poznań International Fair, Lwów&#x27;s &quot;Targi Wschodnie&quot;, and Wilno&#x27;s &quot;Targi Północne&quot;. Polish Radio had ten stations (see Radio stations in interwar Poland), with the eleventh one planned to be opened in the autumn of 1939. Furthermore, in 1935, Polish engineers began working on TV services. By early 1939, experts of the Polish Radio built four TV sets. The first movie broadcast by experimental Polish TV was &quot;Barbara Radziwiłłówna&quot;, and by 1940, a regular TV service was scheduled to begin operation.

Interbellum Poland was also a country with numerous social problems. Unemployment was high, and poverty in the countryside was widespread, which resulted in several cases of social unrest, such as the 1923 Kraków riot, and 1937 peasant strike in Poland. There were conflicts with national minorities, such as the Pacification of Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia (1930), relations with Polish neighbours were sometimes complicated (see Soviet raid on Stołpce, Polish–Czechoslovak border conflicts, and the 1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania). On top of this, there were natural disasters, such as the 1934 flood in Poland.

===Major industrial centres===


Interbellum Poland was unofficially divided into two parts – better developed &quot;Poland A&quot; in the west, and underdeveloped &quot;Poland B&quot; in the east. Polish industry was concentrated in the west, mostly in Polish Upper Silesia, and the adjacent Lesser Poland&#x27;s province of Zagłębie Dąbrowskie, where the bulk of coal mines and steel plants was located. Furthermore, heavy industry plants were located in Częstochowa (&quot;Huta Częstochowa&quot;, founded in 1896), Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski (&quot;Huta Ostrowiec&quot;, founded in 1837–1839), Stalowa Wola (brand new industrial city, which was built from scratch in 1937 – 1938), Chrzanów (&quot;Fablok&quot;, founded in 1919), Jaworzno, Trzebinia (oil refinery, opened in 1895), Łódź (the seat of Polish textile industry), Poznań (H. Cegielski – Poznań), Kraków and Warsaw (Ursus Factory). Further east, in Kresy, industrial centres included two major cities of the region – Lwów and Wilno (Elektrit).

Besides coal mining, Poland also had deposits of oil in Borysław, Drohobycz, Jasło and Gorlice (see Polmin), potassium salt (TESP), and basalt (Janowa Dolina). Apart from already-existing industrial areas, in the mid-1930s an ambitious, state-sponsored project called the Central Industrial Region was started under Minister Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski. One of the characteristic features of the Polish economy in the interbellum was the gradual nationalisation of major plants. This was the case for the Ursus Factory (see Państwowe Zakłady Inżynieryjne) and several steelworks, such as &quot;Huta Pokój&quot; in Ruda Śląska – Nowy Bytom, &quot;Huta Królewska&quot; in Chorzów – Królewska Huta, &quot;Huta Laura&quot; in Siemianowice Śląskie, as well as &quot;Scheibler and Grohman Works&quot; in Łódź.

===Transport===
According to the 1939 &quot;Statistical Yearbook of Poland&quot;, the total length of the railways in Poland (as of 31 December 1937) was . Rail density was per . Railways were very dense in the western part of the country, while in the east, especially Polesie, rail was non-existent in some counties. During the interbellum period, the Polish Government constructed several new lines, mainly in the central part of the country (see also Polish State Railroads Summer 1939). Construction of the extensive Warszawa Główna railway station was never finished due to the war, while Polish railways were famous for their punctuality (see Luxtorpeda, Strzała Bałtyku, Latający Wilnianin).

In the interbellum, the road network of Poland was dense, but the quality of the roads was very poor – only 7% of all roads were paved and ready for automobile use, and none of the major cities were connected with each other by a good-quality highway. In 1939 the Poles built only one highway: 28 km of straight concrete road connecting the villages of Warlubie and Osiek (mid-northern Poland). It was designed by Italian engineer Piero Puricelli.
In the mid-1930s, Poland had of roads, but only 58,000 had a hard surface (gravel, cobblestone or sett), and 2,500 were modern, with an asphalt or concrete surface. In different parts of the country, there were sections of paved roads, which suddenly ended, and were followed by dirt roads. The poor condition of the roads was the result of both long-lasting foreign dominance and inadequate funding. On 29 January 1931, the Polish Parliament created the State Road Fund, the purpose of which was to collect money for the construction and conservation of roads. The government drafted a 10-year plan, with road priorities: a highway from Wilno, through Warsaw and Kraków, to Zakopane (called Marshal Piłsudski Highway), asphalt highways from Warsaw to Poznań and Łódź, as well as a Warsaw ring road. However, the plan turned out to be too ambitious, with insufficient money in the national budget to pay for it. In January 1938, the Polish Road Congress estimated that Poland would need to spend three times as much money on roads to keep up with Western Europe.

In 1939, before the outbreak of the war, LOT Polish Airlines, which was established in 1929, had its hub at Warsaw Okęcie Airport. At that time, LOT maintained several services, both domestic and international. Warsaw had regular domestic connections with Gdynia-Rumia, Danzig-Langfuhr, Katowice-Muchowiec, Kraków-Rakowice-Czyżyny, Lwów-Skniłów, Poznań-Ławica, and Wilno-Porubanek. Furthermore, in cooperation with Air France, LARES, Lufthansa, and Malert, international connections were maintained with Athens, Beirut, Berlin, Bucharest, Budapest, Helsinki, Kaunas, London, Paris, Prague, Riga, Rome, Tallinn, and Zagreb.

===Agriculture===

Statistically, the majority of citizens lived in the countryside (75% in 1921). Farmers made up 65% of the population. In 1929, agricultural production made up 65% of Poland&#x27;s GNP. After 123 years of partitions, regions of the country were very unevenly developed. The lands of the former German Empire were the most advanced; in Greater Poland, Upper Silesia and Pomerelia, farming and crops were on a Western European level. The situation was much worse in parts of Congress Poland, the Eastern Borderlands, and what was formerly Galicia, where agriculture was quite backward and primitive, with a large number of small farms, unable to succeed in either the domestic or international market. Another problem was the overpopulation of the countryside, which resulted in chronic unemployment. Living conditions were so bad in several eastern regions, such as the counties inhabited by the Hutsul minority, that there was permanent starvation. Farmers rebelled against the government (see: 1937 peasant strike in Poland), and the situation began to change in the late 1930s, due to the construction of several factories for the Central Industrial Region, which gave employment to thousands of rural and small town residents.

===German trade===
Beginning in June 1925, there was a customs&#x27; war, with the revanchist Weimar Republic imposing a trade embargo against Poland for nearly a decade; it involved tariffs and broad economic restrictions. After 1933 the trade war ended. The new agreements regulated and promoted trade. Germany became Poland&#x27;s largest trading partner, followed by Britain. In October 1938, Germany granted a credit of 60,000,000 RM to Poland (120,000,000 &quot;zloty&quot;, or £4,800,000) which was never realised, due to the outbreak of war. Germany would deliver factory equipment and machinery in return for Polish timber and agricultural produce. This new trade was to be &quot;in addition&quot; to the existing German-Polish trade agreements.

==Education and culture==

In 1919, the Polish government introduced compulsory education for all children aged 7 to 14, in an effort to limit illiteracy, which was widespread, especially in the former Russian Partition and the Austrian Partition of eastern Poland. In 1921, one-third of citizens of Poland remained illiterate (38% in the countryside). The process was slow, but by 1931 the illiteracy level had dropped to 23% overall (27% in the countryside) and further down to 18% in 1937. By 1939, over 90% of children attended school. In 1932, Janusz Jędrzejewicz, the Minister for Religion and Education, carried out a major reform which introduced two main levels of education: &quot;common school&quot; (&quot;szkoła powszechna&quot;), with three levels – 4 grades + 2 grades + 1 grade; and &quot;middle school&quot; (&quot;szkoła średnia&quot;), with two levels – 4 grades of comprehensive middle school and 2 grades of specified high school (classical, humanistic, natural and mathematical). A graduate of middle school received a &quot;small matura&quot;, while a graduate of high school received a &quot;big matura&quot;, which enabled them to seek university-level education.
Before 1918, Poland had three universities: Jagiellonian University, the University of Warsaw and Lwów University. The Catholic University of Lublin was established in 1918; Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznań, in 1919; and finally, in 1922, after the annexation of the Republic of Central Lithuania, Wilno University became the Republic&#x27;s sixth university. There were also three technical colleges: the Warsaw University of Technology, Lwów Polytechnic and the AGH University of Science and Technology in Kraków, established in 1919. Warsaw University of Life Sciences was an agricultural institute. By 1939, there were around 50,000 students enrolled in further education. 28% of students at universities were women, which was the second highest share in Europe.

Polish science in the interbellum was renowned for its mathematicians gathered around the Lwów School of Mathematics, the Kraków School of Mathematics, as well as the Warsaw School of Mathematics. There were world-class philosophers in the Lwów–Warsaw school of logic and philosophy. Florian Znaniecki founded Polish sociological studies. Rudolf Weigl invented a vaccine against typhus. Bronisław Malinowski counted among the most important anthropologists of the 20th century.

In Polish literature, the 1920s were marked by the domination of poetry. Polish poets were divided into two groups – the Skamanderites (Jan Lechoń, Julian Tuwim, Antoni Słonimski and Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz) and the Futurists (Anatol Stern, Bruno Jasieński, Aleksander Wat, Julian Przyboś). Apart from well-established novelists (Stefan Żeromski, Władysław Reymont), new names appeared in the interbellum – Zofia Nałkowska, Maria Dąbrowska, Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz, Jan Parandowski, Bruno Schultz, Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz, Witold Gombrowicz. Among other notable artists there were sculptor Xawery Dunikowski, painters Julian Fałat, Wojciech Kossak and Jacek Malczewski, composers Karol Szymanowski, Feliks Nowowiejski, and Artur Rubinstein, singer Jan Kiepura.

Theatre was immensely popular in the interbellum, with three main centres in the cities of Warsaw, Wilno and Lwów. Altogether, there were 103 theatres in Poland and a number of other theatrical institutions (including 100 folk theatres). In 1936, different shows were seen by 5 million people, and main figures of Polish theatre of the time were Juliusz Osterwa, Stefan Jaracz, and Leon Schiller. Also, before the outbreak of the war, there were approximately one million radios (see Radio stations in interwar Poland).

==Administrative divisions==

The administrative division of the Second Republic was based on a three-tier system, referring to the administrative division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. On the lowest rung were the &quot;gminy&quot;, local town and village governments akin to districts or parishes. These were then grouped together into &quot;powiaty&quot; (akin to counties), which, in turn, were grouped as &quot;województwa&quot; (voivodeships, akin to provinces). This administrative system passed into the modern Third Polish Republic.

==Demographics==

Historically, Poland was almost always a multiethnic country. This was especially true for the Second Republic, when independence was once again achieved in the wake of the First World War and the subsequent Polish–Soviet War, the latter war being officially ended by the Peace of Riga. The census of 1921 shows 30.8% of the population consisted of ethnic minorities, compared with a share of 1.6% (solely identifying with a non-Polish ethnic group) or 3.8% (including those identifying with both the Polish ethnicity and with another ethnic group) in 2011. The first spontaneous flight of about 500,000 Poles from the Soviet Union occurred during the reconstitution of sovereign Poland. In the second wave, between November 1919 and June 1924, some 1,200,000 people left the territory of the USSR for Poland. It is estimated that some 460,000 of them spoke Polish as the first language. According to the 1931 Polish Census: 69% of the population was Polish, 14% were Ukrainian, around 10% Jewish, 3% Belarusian, 2% German and 3% other, including Lithuanian, Czech, Armenian, Russian, and Romani. The situation of minorities was a complex subject and changed during the period.

Poland was also a nation of many religions. In 1921, 16,057,229 Poles (approx. 62.5%) were Roman (Latin) Catholics, 3,031,057 citizens of Poland (approx. 11.8%) were Eastern Rite Catholics (mostly Ukrainian Greek Catholics and Armenian Rite Catholics), 2,815,817 (approx. 10.95%) were Orthodox, 2,771,949 (approx. 10.8%) were Jewish, and 940,232 (approx. 3.7%) were Protestants (mostly Lutheran).

By 1931, Poland had the second largest Jewish population in the world, with one-fifth of all the world&#x27;s Jews residing within its borders (approx. 3,136,000). The urban population of interbellum Poland was rising steadily; in 1921, only 24% of Poles lived in the cities, in the late 1930s, that proportion grew to 30%. In more than a decade, the population of Warsaw grew by 200,000, Łódź by 150,000, and Poznań – by 100,000. This was due not only to internal migration, but also to an extremely high birth rate.

==Status of ethnic minorities==
=== Jews ===
From the 1920s, the Polish government excluded Jews from receiving government bank loans, public sector employment, and obtaining business licenses. From the 1930s, measures were taken against Jewish shops, Jewish export firms, &quot;Shechita&quot; as well as limitations being placed on Jewish admission to the medical and legal professions, Jews in business associations and the enrollment of Jews into universities. The political movement National Democracy (&quot;Endecja&quot;, from the abbreviation &quot;ND&quot;) often organised anti-Jewish business boycotts. Following the death of Marshal Józef Piłsudski in 1935, the &quot;Endecja&quot; intensified their efforts, which triggered violence in extreme cases in smaller towns across the country. In 1937, the National Democracy movement passed resolutions that &quot;its main aim and duty must be to remove the Jews from all spheres of social, economic, and cultural life in Poland&quot;. The government in response organised the Camp of National Unity (OZON), which in 1938 took control of the Polish &quot;Sejm&quot; and subsequently drafted anti-Semitic legislation similar to the Anti-Jewish laws in Germany, Hungary, and Romania. OZON advocated mass emigration of Jews from Poland, numerus clausus (see also Ghetto benches), and other limitations on Jewish rights. According to William W. Hagen, by 1939, prior to the war, Polish Jews were threatened with conditions similar to those in Nazi Germany.

===Ukrainians===
The pre-war government also restricted the rights of people who declared Ukrainian nationality, belonged to the Eastern Orthodox Church and inhabited the Eastern Borderlands of the Second Polish Republic. Poland refused to grant the Ukrainian minority a territorial autonomy. Ukrainian was restricted in every field possible, especially in governmental institutions, and the term &quot;Ruthenian&quot; was enforced in an attempt to ban the use of the term &quot;Ukrainian&quot;. Ukrainians were categorised as uneducated second-class peasants or third world people, and rarely settled outside the Eastern Borderland region due to the prevailing Ukrainophobia and restrictions imposed. Numerous attempts at restoring the Ukrainian state were suppressed and any existent violence or terrorism initiated by the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists was emphasised to create the image of a &quot;brutal Eastern savage&quot;. After 1935, Polish policy towards Ukrainians shifted its focus from state consolidation to the ethnic assimilation of part of the Ukrainian population through Polonization and conversion to Roman Catholicism.

==Geography==
The Second Polish Republic was mainly flat with an average elevation of above sea level, except for the southernmost Carpathian Mountains (after the Second World War and its border changes, the average elevation of Poland decreased to ). Only 13% of territory, along the southern border, was higher than . The highest elevation in the country was Mount Rysy, which rises in the Tatra Range of the Carpathians, approximately south of Kraków. Between October 1938 and September 1939, the highest elevation was Lodowy Szczyt (known in Slovak as &quot;Ľadový štít&quot;), which rises above sea level. The largest lake was Lake Narach.
The country&#x27;s total area, after the annexation of Trans-Olza, was . It extended from north to south and from east to west. On 1 January 1938, total length of boundaries was , including: of coastline (out of which were made by the Hel Peninsula), the with Soviet Union, 948 kilometers with Czechoslovakia (until 1938), with Germany (together with East Prussia), and with other countries (Lithuania, Romania, Latvia, Danzig). The warmest yearly average temperature was in Kraków among major cities of the Second Polish Republic, at in 1938; and the coldest in Wilno ( in 1938). Extreme geographical points of Poland included Przeświata River in Somino to the north (located in the Braslaw county of the Wilno Voivodeship); Manczin River to the south (located in the Kosów county of the Stanisławów Voivodeship); Spasibiorki near railway to Połock to the east (located in the Dzisna county of the Wilno Voivodeship); and Mukocinek near Warta River and Meszyn Lake to the west (located in the Międzychód county of the Poznań Voivodeship).

===Waters===
Almost 75% of the territory of interbellum Poland was drained northward into the Baltic Sea by the Vistula (total area of drainage basin of the Vistula within boundaries of the Second Polish Republic was , the Niemen (), the Oder () and the Daugava (). The remaining part of the country was drained southward, into the Black Sea, by the rivers that drain into the Dnieper (Pripyat, Horyn and Styr, all together ) as well as Dniester ()

==Invasion of Poland in 1939==


The beginning of the Second World War in September 1939 ended the sovereign Second Polish Republic. The German invasion of Poland began on 1 September 1939, one week after Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed the secret Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. On that day, Germany and Slovakia attacked Poland, and on 17 September the Soviets attacked eastern Poland. Warsaw fell to the Nazis on 28 September after a twenty-day siege. Open organised Polish resistance ended on 6 October 1939 after the Battle of Kock, with Germany and the Soviet Union occupying most of the country. Lithuania annexed the area of Wilno, and Slovakia seized areas along Poland&#x27;s southern border – including Górna Orawa and Tatranská Javorina - which Poland had annexed from Czechoslovakia in October 1938. Poland did not surrender to the invaders, but continued fighting under the auspices of the Polish government-in-exile and of the Polish Underground State. After the signing of the German–Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation on 28 September 1939, Polish areas occupied by Nazi Germany either became directly incorporated into Nazi Germany, or became part of the General Government. The Soviet Union, following Elections to the People&#x27;s Assemblies of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus (22 October 1939), annexed eastern Poland partly to the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, and partly to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (November 1939).
Polish war plans (Plan West and Plan East) failed as soon as Germany invaded in 1939. The Polish losses in combat against Germans (killed and missing in action) amounted to ca. 70,000 men. Some 420,000 of them were taken prisoners. Losses against the Red Army (which invaded Poland on 17 September) added up to 6,000 to 7,000 of casualties and MIA, 250,000 were taken prisoners. Although the Polish Army – considering the inactivity of the Allies – was in an unfavourable position – it managed to inflict serious losses to the enemies: 20,000 German soldiers were killed or MIA, 674 tanks and 319 armored vehicles destroyed or badly damaged, 230 aircraft shot down; the Red Army lost (killed and MIA) about 2,500 soldiers, 150 combat vehicles and 20 aircraft. The Soviet invasion of Poland, and lack of promised aid from the Western Allies, contributed to the Polish forces defeat by 6 October 1939.
A popular myth is that Polish cavalry armed with lances charged German tanks during the September 1939 campaign. This often repeated account, first reported by Italian journalists as German propaganda, concerned an action by the Polish 18th Lancer Regiment near Chojnice. This arose from misreporting of a single clash on 1 September 1939 near Krojanty, when two squadrons of the Polish 18th Lancers armed with sabers surprised and wiped out a German infantry formation with a mounted saber charge. Shortly after midnight the 2nd (Motorized) Division was compelled to withdraw by Polish cavalry, before the Poles were caught in the open by German armored cars. The story arose because some German armored cars appeared and gunned down 20 troopers as the cavalry escaped. Even this failed to persuade everyone to reexamine their beliefs—there were some who thought Polish cavalry had been improperly employed in 1939.

Between 1945 and 1990, the Polish government-in-exile operated in London, presenting itself as the only legal and legitimate representative of the Polish nation and challenging the legitimacy of the communist government in Warsaw. In 1990, the last president in exile, Ryszard Kaczorowski, handed the presidential insignia to the newly elected President, Lech Wałęsa, signifying continuity between the Second and Third republics.

<doc id="14254" wikidata="Q38203" url="?curid=14254" title="Helen Keller">
<text>Helen Adams Keller (June 27, 1880 – June 1, 1968) was an American author, disability rights advocate, political activist and lecturer. Born in West Tuscumbia, Alabama, she lost her sight and her hearing after a bout of illness when she was 19 months old. She then communicated primarily using home signs until the age of seven, when she met her first teacher and life-long companion Anne Sullivan. Sullivan taught Keller language, including reading and writing. After an education at both specialist and mainstream schools, Keller attended Radcliffe College of Harvard University and became the first deafblind person in the United States to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree.

Keller was also a prolific author, writing 14 books and hundreds of speeches and essays on topics ranging from animals to Mahatma Gandhi. Keller campaigned for those with disabilities and for women&#x27;s suffrage, labor rights, and world peace. In 1909, she joined the Socialist Party of America (SPA). She was a founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).

Keller&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Story of My Life&quot; (1903), publicized her education and life with Sullivan. It was adapted as a play by William Gibson, later adapted as a film under the same title, &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;. Her birthplace has been designated and preserved as a National Historic Landmark. Since 1954, it has been operated as a house museum, and sponsors an annual &quot;Helen Keller Day&quot;.

==Early childhood and illness==

Keller was born on June 27, 1880, in Tuscumbia, Alabama, the daughter of Arthur Henley Keller (1836–1896), and Catherine Everett (Adams) Keller (1856–1921), known as &quot;Kate&quot;. The Keller family lived on a homestead, Ivy Green, which her paternal grandfather had built decades earlier. She had four siblings: two full siblings, Mildred Campbell (Keller) Tyson and Phillip Brooks Keller; and two older half-brothers from her father&#x27;s first marriage, James McDonald Keller and William Simpson Keller.

Keller&#x27;s father worked for many years as an editor of the Tuscumbia &quot;North Alabamian&quot;. He had served as a captain in the Confederate Army. The family was part of the slaveholding elite before the American Civil War, but lost status later. Her mother was the daughter of Charles W. Adams, a Confederate general. Keller&#x27;s paternal lineage was traced to Casper Keller, a native of Switzerland. One of Helen&#x27;s Swiss ancestors was the first teacher for the deaf in Zürich. Keller reflected on this fact in her first autobiography, asserting that &quot;there is no king who has not had a slave among his ancestors, and no slave who has not had a king among his&quot;.

At 19 months old, Keller contracted an unknown illness described by doctors as &quot;an acute congestion of the stomach and the brain&quot;. Contemporary doctors believe it may have been meningitis, caused by the bacterium &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot; (meningococcus), or possibly &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, which can cause the same symptoms but is less likely because of its 97% juvenile mortality rate at that time. She was able to recover from her illness, but was left permanently blind and deaf, as she recalled in her autobiography, &quot;at sea in a dense fog&quot;. At that time, Keller was able to communicate somewhat with Martha Washington, who was two years older and the daughter of the family cook, and understood the girl&#x27;s signs;by the age of seven, Keller had more than 60 home signs to communicate with her family, and could distinguish people by the vibration of their footsteps.

In 1886, Keller&#x27;s mother, inspired by an account in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;American Notes&quot; of the successful education of Laura Bridgman, a deaf and blind woman, dispatched the young Keller and her father to consult physician J. Julian Chisholm, an eye, ear, nose and throat specialist in Baltimore, for advice. Chisholm referred the Kellers to Alexander Graham Bell, who was working with deaf children at the time. Bell advised them to contact the Perkins Institute for the Blind, the school where Bridgman had been educated. It was then located in South Boston. Michael Anagnos, the school&#x27;s director, asked Anne Sullivan, a 20-year-old alumna of the school who was visually impaired, to become Keller&#x27;s instructor. It was the beginning of a nearly 50-year-long relationship Sullivan developed with Keller as her governess and later her companion.

Sullivan arrived at Keller&#x27;s house on March 5, 1887, a day Keller would forever remember as &quot;my soul&#x27;s birthday&quot;. Sullivan immediately began to teach Helen to communicate by spelling words into her hand, beginning with &quot;d-o-l-l&quot; for the doll that she had brought Keller as a present. Keller initially struggled with lessons since she could not comprehend that every object had a word identifying it. When Sullivan was trying to teach Keller the word for &quot;mug&quot;, Keller became so frustrated she broke the mug. Keller remembered how she soon began imitating Sullivan&#x27;s hand gestures: &quot;I did not know that I was spelling a word or even that words existed. I was simply making my fingers go in monkey-like imitation.&quot;

The next month, Keller made a breakthrough, when she realized that the motions her teacher was making on the palm of her hand, while running cool water over her other hand, symbolized the idea of &quot;water&quot;. Writing in her autobiography, &quot;The Story of My Life&quot;, Keller recalled the moment:

Keller quickly demanded that Sullivan sign the names of all the other familiar objects in her world.

==Formal education==
In May 1888, Keller started attending the Perkins Institute for the Blind. In 1893, Keller, along with Sullivan, attended William Wade House and Finishing School. In 1894, Keller and Sullivan moved to New York to attend the Wright-Humason School for the Deaf, and to learn from Sarah Fuller at the Horace Mann School for the Deaf. In 1896, they returned to Massachusetts, and Keller entered The Cambridge School for Young Ladies before gaining admittance, in 1900, to Radcliffe College of Harvard University, where she lived in Briggs Hall, South House. Her admirer, Mark Twain, had introduced her to Standard Oil magnate Henry Huttleston Rogers, who, with his wife Abbie, paid for her education. In 1904, at the age of 24, Keller graduated from Radcliffe as a member of Phi Beta Kappa, becoming the first deafblind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree. She maintained a correspondence with the Austrian pedagogue and philosopher Wilhelm Jerusalem, who was one of the first to discover her literary talent.

Determined to communicate with others as conventionally as possible, Keller learned to speak and spent much of her life giving speeches and lectures on aspects of her life. She learned to &quot;hear&quot; people&#x27;s speech using the Tadoma method, which means using her fingers to feel the lips and throat of the speaker. She became proficient at using braille, and also used fingerspelling to communicate. Shortly before World War I, with the assistance of the Zoellner Quartet, she determined that by placing her fingertips on a resonant tabletop she could experience music played close by.

==Companions==
Anne Sullivan stayed as a companion to Keller long after she taught her. Sullivan married John Macy in 1905, and her health started failing around 1914. Polly Thomson (February 20, 1885 – March 21, 1960) was hired to keep house. She was a young woman from Scotland who had no experience with deaf or blind people. She progressed to working as a secretary as well, and eventually became a constant companion to Keller.

Keller moved to Forest Hills, Queens, together with Sullivan and Macy, and used the house as a base for her efforts on behalf of the American Foundation for the Blind. While in her 30s, Keller had a love affair and became secretly engaged; she also defied her teacher and family by attempting an elopement with the man she loved, Peter Fagan, who was known as &quot;the fingerspelling socialist&quot;, and was a young &quot;Boston Herald&quot; reporter sent to Keller&#x27;s home to act as her private secretary when Sullivan fell ill. At the time, her father had died and Sullivan was recovering in Lake Placid and Puerto Rico. Keller had moved with her mother in Montgomery, Alabama.

Sullivan died in 1936, with Keller holding her hand, after falling into a coma as a result of coronary thrombosis. Keller and Thomson moved to Connecticut. They traveled worldwide and raised funds for the blind. Thomson had a stroke in 1957 from which she never fully recovered and died in 1960. Winnie Corbally, a nurse originally hired to care for Thomson in 1957, stayed on after Thomson&#x27;s death and was Keller&#x27;s companion for the rest of her life.

==Career, writing and political activities==

On January 22, 1916, Keller and Sullivan traveled to the small town of Menomonie in western Wisconsin to deliver a lecture at the Mabel Tainter Memorial Building. Details of her talk were provided in the weekly &quot;Dunn County News&quot; on January 22, 1916:

Keller became a world-famous speaker and author. She was an advocate for people with disabilities, amid numerous other causes. She traveled to twenty-five different countries giving motivational speeches about deaf people&#x27;s conditions. She was a suffragist, pacifist, Christian socialist, birth control supporter, and opponent of Woodrow Wilson. In 1915, she and George A. Kessler founded the Helen Keller International (HKI) organization. This organization is devoted to research in vision, health, and nutrition. In 1916, she sent money to the NAACP, as she was ashamed of the Southern un-Christian treatment of &quot;colored people&quot;.

In 1920, Keller helped to found the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). She traveled to over 40 countries with Sullivan, making several trips to Japan and becoming a favorite of the Japanese people. Keller met every U.S. president from Grover Cleveland to Lyndon B. Johnson and was friends with many famous figures, including Alexander Graham Bell, Charlie Chaplin, and Mark Twain. Keller and Twain were both considered political radicals allied with leftist politics.

Keller, who believed that the poor were &quot;ground down by industrial oppression&quot;, wanted children born into poor families to have the same opportunities to succeed that she had enjoyed. She wrote, &quot;I owed my success partly to the advantages of my birth and environment. I have learned that the power to rise is not within the reach of everyone.&quot;

In 1909, Keller became a member of the Socialist Party of America (SPA); she actively campaigned and wrote in support of the working class from 1909 to 1921. Many of her speeches and writings were about women&#x27;s right to vote and the effects of war; in addition, she supported causes that opposed military intervention. She had speech therapy to have her voice understood better by the public. When the Rockefeller-owned press refused to print her articles, she protested until her work was finally published.

Keller supported the SPA candidate Eugene V. Debs in each of his campaigns for the presidency. Before reading &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; by Henry George, she was already a socialist who believed that Georgism was a good step in the right direction. She later wrote of finding &quot;in Henry George&#x27;s philosophy a rare beauty and power of inspiration, and a splendid faith in the essential nobility of human nature&quot;. Keller stated that newspaper columnists who had praised her courage and intelligence before she expressed her socialist views now called attention to her disabilities. The editor of the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; wrote that her &quot;mistakes sprung out of the manifest limitations of her development&quot;. Keller responded to that editor, referring to having met him before he knew of her political views:

In 1912, Keller joined the Industrial Workers of the World (the IWW, known as the Wobblies), saying that parliamentary socialism was &quot;sinking in the political bog&quot;. She wrote for the IWW between 1916 and 1918. In &quot;Why I Became an IWW&quot;, Keller explained that her motivation for activism came in part from her concern about blindness and other disabilities:

The last sentence refers to prostitution and syphilis, the former a &quot;life of shame&quot; that women used to support themselves, which contributed to their contracting syphilis. Untreated, it was a leading cause of blindness. In the same interview, Keller also cited the 1912 strike of textile workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, for instigating her support of socialism. As a result of her advocacy, she was placed on the FBI&#x27;s watchlist; the FBI wrote on July 1, 1953, that although they have not &quot;conducted an investigation with regard to Helen Adams Keller&quot;, their files of Keller &quot;reflect the following pertinent information concerning this individual&quot;.

Keller supported eugenics, which had become popular with both new understandings and misapprehensions of principles of biological inheritance. In 1915, she wrote in favor of refusing life-saving medical procedures to infants with severe mental impairments or physical deformities, saying that their lives were not worthwhile and they would likely become criminals. Keller also expressed concerns about human overpopulation. From 1946 to 1957, Keller visited 35 countries. In 1948, she went to New Zealand and visited deaf schools in Christchurch and Auckland. She met Deaf Society of Canterbury Life Member Patty Still in Christchurch.

== Works ==
Keller wrote a total of 12 published books and several articles. One of her earliest pieces of writing, at age 11, was &quot;The Frost King&quot; (1891). There were allegations that this story had been plagiarized from &quot;The Frost Fairies&quot; by Margaret Canby. An investigation into the matter revealed that Keller may have experienced a case of cryptomnesia, which was that she had Canby&#x27;s story read to her but forgot about it, while the memory remained in her subconscious.

At age 22, with help from Sullivan and Sullivan&#x27;s husband John Macy, Keller published her autobiography, &quot;The Story of My Life&quot; (1903). It recounts the story of her life up to age 21 and was written during her time in college. In an article Keller wrote in 1907, she brought to public attention the fact that many cases of childhood blindness could be prevented by washing the eyes of every newborn baby with a disinfectant solution. At the time, only a fraction of doctors and midwives were doing this. Thanks to Keller&#x27;s advocacy, this commonsense public health measure was swiftly and widely adopted.

Keller wrote &quot;The World I Live In&quot; in 1908, giving readers an insight into how she felt about the world. &quot;Out of the Dark&quot;, a series of essays on socialism, was published in 1913. When Keller was young, Anne Sullivan introduced her to Phillips Brooks, who introduced her to Christianity, Keller famously saying: &quot;I always knew He was there, but I didn&#x27;t know His name!&quot;

Her spiritual autobiography, &quot;My Religion&quot;, was published in 1927 and then in 1994 extensively revised by Ray Silverman, and re-issued under the title &quot;Light in My Darkness&quot;. It advocates the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg, the Christian theologian and mystic who gave a spiritual interpretation of the teachings of the Bible and who claimed that the Second Coming of Jesus Christ had already taken place. Keller described the core of her belief in these words:

===Archival material===
The Helen Keller Archives in New York are owned by the American Foundation for the Blind. Archival material of Keller stored in New York was lost when the Twin Towers were destroyed in the September 11 attacks.

==Later life and death==
Keller had a series of strokes in 1961 and spent the last years of her life at her home. On September 14, 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the United States&#x27; two highest civilian honors. In 1965, she was elected to the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame at the New York World&#x27;s Fair. Keller devoted much of her later life to raising funds for the American Foundation for the Blind. She died in her sleep on June 1, 1968, at her home, Arcan Ridge, located in Easton, Connecticut, at the age of 87. A service was held at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., and her body was cremated in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Her ashes were buried at the Washington National Cathedral next to her constant companions, Anne Sullivan and Polly Thomson.

==Portrayals==
Keller&#x27;s life has been interpreted many times. She and her companion Anne Sullivan appeared in a silent film, &quot;Deliverance&quot; (1919), which told her story in a melodramatic, allegorical style. She was also the subject of the Academy Award-winning 1954 documentary &quot;Helen Keller in Her Story&quot;, narrated by her friend and noted theatrical actress Katharine Cornell; in 2023, the film was added to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. She was also profiled in &quot;The Story of Helen Keller&quot;, part of the Famous Americans series produced by Hearst Entertainment. In the 1950s, when she was considered by many worldwide the greatest woman alive, Hearst reporter Adela Rogers St. Johns told friends that she did not plan to include Keller in the book she was writing about the most famous women of the United States.

&quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; is a literature cycle of dramatic works ultimately derived from her autobiography, &quot;The Story of My Life&quot;. The various dramas each describe the relationship between Keller and Sullivan, depicting how the teacher led her from a state of almost feral wildness into education, activism, and intellectual celebrity. The common title of the cycle echoes Mark Twain&#x27;s description of Sullivan as a &quot;miracle worker&quot;. Its first realization, starring Patty McCormack as Keller and Teresa Wright as Sullivan, was the 1957 &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; teleplay of that title by William Gibson. When Keller heard about it, she was enthusiastic, saying: &quot;Never did I dream a drama could be devised out of the story of my life.&quot; Within the cultural context of the early civil rights movement, Gibson adapted it for a Broadway production in 1959, which was praised by critics as a contemporary classic, and an Oscar-winning feature film in 1962, starring Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke. It was remade for television in 1979, and then again in 2000.

An anime movie called &quot;The Story of Helen Keller: Angel of Love and Light&quot; was made in 1981. In 1984, Keller&#x27;s life story was made into a TV movie called &quot;The Miracle Continues&quot;. This film, a semi-sequel to &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;, recounts her college years and her early adult life. None of the early movies hint at the social activism that would become the hallmark of Keller&#x27;s later life, although a Disney version produced in 2000 states in the credits that she became an activist for social equality. The Bollywood movie &quot;Black&quot; (2005) was largely based on Keller&#x27;s story from her childhood to her graduation.

A documentary called &quot;Shining Soul: Helen Keller&#x27;s Spiritual Life and Legacy&quot; was produced by the Swedenborg Foundation in 2005. The film focuses on the role played by Emanuel Swedenborg&#x27;s spiritual theology in her life and how it inspired Keller&#x27;s triumph over her triple disabilities of blindness, deafness, and a severe speech impediment. On March 6, 2008, the New England Historic Genealogical Society announced that a staff member had discovered a rare 1888 photograph showing Helen and Anne, which, although previously published, had escaped widespread attention. Depicting Helen holding one of her many dolls, it is believed to be the earliest surviving photograph of Anne Sullivan Macy. Video footage showing Keller speaking also exists.

A biography of Keller was written by the German Jewish author H. J. Kaeser. A painting titled &quot;The Advocate: Tribute to Helen Keller&quot; was created by three artists from Kerala, India, as a tribute to Keller. The painting, which depicts the major events of Keller&#x27;s life and is one of the biggest paintings done based on her life, was created in association with a non-profit organization Art d&#x27;Hope Foundation, artists groups Palette People, and XakBoX Design &amp; Art Studio. This painting was created for a fundraising event to help blind students in India, and was inaugurated by M. G. Rajamanikyam, IAS (District Collector Ernakulam) on Helen Keller day (June 27, 2016). In 2020, the documentary essay &quot;Her Socialist Smile&quot; by John Gianvito evolves around Keller&#x27;s first public talk in 1913 before a general audience, when she started speaking out on behalf of progressive causes.

==Posthumous honors==
In 1999, Keller was listed fifth (at 30 percent) in Gallup&#x27;s Most Widely Admired People of the 20th century. That same year, Keller was also named one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century. In 2003, Alabama honored its native daughter on its state quarter. The Alabama state quarter is the only circulating U.S. coin to feature braille. The Helen Keller Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama, is dedicated to her. Streets are named after Keller in Zurich, Switzerland; in Alabama and New York in the United States; in Getafe, Spain; in Vienna, Austria; in Lod, Israel; in Lisbon, Portugal; in Caen, France; and in São Paulo, Brazil. A preschool for the deaf and hard of hearing in Mysore, India, was originally named after Keller by its founder, K. K. Srinivasan. In 1973, Keller was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

A stamp was issued in 1980 (pictured) by the United States Postal Service, depicting Keller and Sullivan, to mark the centennial of Keller&#x27;s birth. That year, her birth was also recognized by a presidential proclamation from U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Pennsylvania annually commemorates her June 27 birthday as Helen Keller Day. On October 7, 2009, the State of Alabama donated a bronze statue of Keller to the National Statuary Hall Collection, as a replacement for its 1908 statue of education reformer Jabez Lamar Monroe Curry. Keller was posthumously inducted into the Alabama Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1971. She was one of twelve inaugural inductees to the Alabama Writers Hall of Fame on June 8, 2015.

<doc id="14257" wikidata="Q5637688" url="?curid=14257" title="Haddocks' Eyes">
<text>&quot;Haddocks&#x27; Eyes&quot; is the nickname of the name of a song sung by The White Knight from Lewis Carroll&#x27;s 1871 novel &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, .

&quot;Haddocks&#x27; Eyes&quot; is an example used to elaborate on the symbolic status of the concept of &quot;name&quot;: a name as identification marker may be assigned to anything, including another name, thus introducing different levels of symbolization. It has been discussed in several works on logic and philosophy.

==Naming==

The White Knight explains to Alice a confusing nomenclature for the song.

To summarize:

*The song&#x27;s name is called &quot;Haddocks&#x27; Eyes&quot;
*The song&#x27;s name is &quot;The Aged Aged Man&quot;
*The song is called &quot;Ways and Means&quot;
*The song is &quot;A-sitting on a Gate&quot;

The complicated terminology distinguishing between &#x27;the song, what the song is called, the name of the song, and what the name of the song is called&#x27; both uses and mentions the use–mention distinction.

==The song==

The White Knight sings the song to a tune he claims as his own invention, but which Alice recognises as &quot;I give thee all, I can no more&quot;. By the time Alice heard it, she was already tired of poetry.

The song parodies the plot, but not the style or metre, of &quot;Resolution and Independence&quot; by William Wordsworth.

==Upon the Lonely Moor==

Like &quot;Jabberwocky,&quot; another poem published in &quot;Through the Looking Glass,&quot; &quot;Haddocks’ Eyes&quot; appears to have been revised over the course of many years. In 1856, Carroll published the following poem anonymously under the name &quot;Upon the Lonely Moor&quot;. It bears an obvious resemblance to &quot;Haddocks&#x27; Eyes.&quot;

<doc id="14260" wikidata="Q359058" url="?curid=14260" title="Hoosier">
<text>Hoosier is the official demonym for the people of the U.S. state of Indiana. The origin of the term remains a matter of debate; however, &quot;Hoosier&quot; was in general use by the 1840s, having been popularized by Richmond resident John Finley&#x27;s 1833 poem &quot;The Hoosier&#x27;s Nest&quot;. Indiana adopted the nickname &quot;The Hoosier State&quot; more than 150 years ago.

&quot;Hoosier&quot; is used in the names of numerous Indiana-based businesses and organizations. &quot;Hoosiers&quot; is also the name of the Indiana University athletic teams. As there is no accepted embodiment of a Hoosier, the IU schools are represented through their letters and colors alone. The term is universally accepted by residents of Indiana and, as of 2017, is also the official demonym used by the U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO), making it the only GPO-recommended demonym of any US state that is not directly formed from the state&#x27;s name. Before 2017, the GPO-recommended demonym for the state was &quot;Indianian&quot;.

==Origin==
In addition to &quot;The Hoosier&#x27;s Nest,&quot; the term also appeared in the &quot;Indianapolis Journal&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Carrier&#x27;s Address&quot; on January 1, 1833. There are many suggestions for the derivation of the word but none is universally accepted. In 1833 the Pittsburgh &quot;Statesman&quot; said the term had been in use for &quot;some time past&quot; and suggested it originated from census workers calling &quot;Who&#x27;s here?&quot;. Also in 1833, former Indiana Governor James B. Ray began publishing a newspaper titled &quot;The Hoosier&quot;.

===Scholarship===

In 1900, Meredith Nicholson wrote &quot;The Hoosiers&quot;, an early attempt to study the etymology of the word as applied to Indiana residents. Jacob Piatt Dunn, longtime secretary of the Indiana Historical Society, published &quot;The Word Hoosier&quot;, a similar attempt, in 1907. Both chronicled some of the popular and satirical etymologies circulating at the time and focused much of their attention on the use of the word in the Upland South to refer to woodsmen, yokels, and rough people. Dunn traced the word back to the Cumbrian , meaning anything unusually large, derived from the Old English &quot;hoo&quot; (as at Sutton Hoo), meaning &quot;high&quot; and &quot;hill&quot;. The importance of immigrants from northern England and southern Scotland was reflected in numerous placenames including the Cumberland Mountains, the Cumberland River, and the Cumberland Gap. Nicholson defended the people of Indiana against such an association, while Dunn concluded that the early settlers had adopted the nickname self-mockingly and that it had lost its negative associations by the time of Finley&#x27;s poem.

Johnathan Clark Smith subsequently showed that Nicholson and Dunn&#x27;s earliest sources within Indiana were mistaken. A letter by James Curtis cited by Dunn and others as the earliest known use of the term was actually written in 1846, not 1826. Similarly, the use of the term in an 1859 newspaper item quoting an 1827 diary entry by Sandford Cox was more likely an editorial comment and not from the original diary. Smith&#x27;s earliest sources led him to argue that the word originated as a term along the Ohio River for flatboatmen from Indiana and did not acquire its pejorative meanings until 1836, &quot;after&quot; Finley&#x27;s poem.

William Piersen, a history professor at Fisk University, argued for a connection to the Methodist minister Rev. Harry Hosier (–May 1806), who evangelized the American frontier at the beginning of the 19th century as part of the Second Great Awakening. &quot;Black Harry&quot; had been born a slave in North Carolina and sold north to Baltimore, Maryland, before gaining his freedom and beginning his ministry around the end of the American Revolution. He was a close associate and personal friend of Bishop Francis Asbury, the &quot;Father of the American Methodist Church&quot;. Benjamin Rush said of him that &quot;making allowances for his illiteracy, he was the greatest orator in America&quot;. His sermons called on Methodists to reject slavery and to champion the common working man. Piersen proposed that Methodist communities inspired by his example took or were given a variant spelling of his name (possibly influenced by the &quot;yokel&quot; slang) during the decades after his ministry.

According to Washington County newspaper reports of the time, Abraham Stover was Colonel of the Indiana Militia. He was a colorful figure in early Washington County history. Along with his son-in-law, John B. Brough, he was considered one of the two strongest men in Washington County. He was always being challenged to prove his might, and seems to have won several fights over men half his age. After whipping six or eight men in a fist fight in Louisville, Kentucky, he cracked his fists and said, &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a husher&quot;, which was changed in the news to &quot;Hoosier&quot;, and thus originated the name of Hoosier in connection with Indiana men.

Jorge Santander Serrano, a PhD student from Indiana University, has also suggested that &quot;Hoosier&quot; might come from the French words for &#x27;redness&#x27;, , or &#x27;red-faced&#x27;, . According to this hypothesis, the early pejorative use of the word &quot;Hoosier&quot; may have a link to the color red (&quot;rouge&quot; in French) which is associated with indigenous peoples, pejoratively called &quot;red men&quot; or &quot;red-skins&quot;, and also with poor white people by calling them &quot;red-necks&quot;.

===Folk etymologies===
====&quot;Who&#x27;sh &#x27;ere?&quot;====
Humorous folk etymologies for the term &quot;hoosier&quot; have a long history, as recounted by Dunn in &quot;The Word Hoosier&quot;.

One account traces the word to the necessary caution of approaching houses on the frontier. In order to avoid being shot, a traveler would call out from afar to let themselves be known. The inhabitants of the cabin would then reply &quot;Who&#x27;s here?&quot; which in the Appalachian English of the early settlers slurred into &quot;Who&#x27;sh &#x27;ere?&quot; and thence into &quot;Hoosier?&quot; A variant of this account had the Indiana pioneers calling out &quot;Who&#x27;sh &#x27;ere?&quot; as a general greeting and warning when hearing someone in the bushes and tall grass, to avoid shooting a relative or friend in error.

The poet James Whitcomb Riley facetiously suggested that the fierce brawling that took place in Indiana involved enough biting that the expression &quot;Whose ear?&quot; became notable. This arose from or inspired the story of two 19th-century French immigrants brawling in a tavern in the foothills of southern Indiana. One was cut and a third Frenchman walked in to see an ear on the dirt floor of the tavern, prompting him to slur out &quot;Whosh ear?&quot;

====Mr. Hoosier&#x27;s men====

Two related stories trace the origin of the term to gangs of workers from Indiana under the direction of a Mr. Hoosier.

The account related by Dunn is that a Louisville contractor named Samuel Hoosier preferred to hire workers from communities on the Indiana side of the Ohio River like New Albany rather than Kentuckians. During the excavation of the first canal around the Falls of the Ohio from 1826 to 1833, his employees became known as &quot;Hoosier&#x27;s men&quot; and then simply &quot;Hoosiers&quot;. The usage spread from these hard-working laborers to all of the Indiana boatmen in the area and then spread north with the settlement of the state. The story was told to Dunn in 1901 by a man who had heard it from a Hoosier relative while traveling in southern Tennessee. Dunn could not find any family of the given name in any directory in the region or anyone else in southern Tennessee who had heard the story and accounted himself dubious. This version was subsequently retold by Gov. Evan Bayh and Sen. Vance Hartke, who introduced the story into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; in 1975, and matches the timing and location of Smith&#x27;s subsequent research. However, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been unable to find any record of a Hoosier or Hosier in surviving canal company records.

==Other uses==
The word &quot;hoosier&quot; has been used in Greater St. Louis as a pejorative for an unintelligent or uncultured person. The word is also encountered in sea shanties. In the book &quot;Shanties from the Seven Seas&quot; by Stan Hugill, in reference to its former use to denote cotton-stowers, who would move bales of cotton to and from the holds of ships and force them in tightly by means of jackscrews.

A Hoosier cabinet, often shortened to &quot;hoosier&quot;, is a type of free-standing kitchen cabinet popular in the early decades of the twentieth century. Almost all of these cabinets were produced by companies located in Indiana and the name derives from the largest of them, the Hoosier Manufacturing Co. of New Castle, Indiana. Other Indiana businesses include Hoosier Racing Tire and the Hoosier Bat Company, manufacturer of wooden baseball bats.

The RCA Dome, former home of the Indianapolis Colts, was known as the &quot;Hoosier Dome&quot; before RCA purchased the naming rights in 1994. The RCA Dome was replaced by Lucas Oil Stadium in 2008.

<text>In mathematics and computer science, Horner&#x27;s method (or Horner&#x27;s scheme) is an algorithm for polynomial evaluation. Although named after William George Horner, this method is much older, as it has been attributed to Joseph-Louis Lagrange by Horner himself, and can be traced back many hundreds of years to Chinese and Persian mathematicians. After the introduction of computers, this algorithm became fundamental for computing efficiently with polynomials.

The algorithm is based on Horner&#x27;s rule, in which a polynomial is written in &quot;nested form&quot;:
formula_1

This allows the evaluation of a polynomial of degree with only formula_2 multiplications and formula_2 additions. This is optimal, since there are polynomials of degree that cannot be evaluated with fewer arithmetic operations.

Alternatively, Horner&#x27;s method and  also refers to a method for approximating the roots of polynomials, described by Horner in 1819. It is a variant of the Newton–Raphson method made more efficient for hand calculation by application of Horner&#x27;s rule. It was widely used until computers came into general use around 1970.

== Polynomial evaluation and long division ==

Given the polynomial
formula_4
where formula_5 are constant coefficients, the problem is to evaluate the polynomial at a specific value formula_6 of formula_7

For this, a new sequence of constants is defined recursively as follows:

Then formula_8 is the value of formula_9.

To see why this works, the polynomial can be written in the form
formula_10

Thus, by iteratively substituting the formula_11 into the expression,
formula_12

Now, it can be proven that;

This expression constitutes Horner&#x27;s practical application, as it offers a very quick way of determining the outcome of;
formula_13
with formula_8 (which is equal to formula_9) being the division&#x27;s remainder, as is demonstrated by the examples below. If formula_6 is a root of formula_17, then formula_18 (meaning the remainder is formula_19), which means you can factor formula_17 as formula_21. 

To finding the consecutive formula_22-values, you start with determining formula_23, which is simply equal to formula_24. Then you then work recursively using the formula:
formula_25
till you arrive at formula_8.

=== Examples ===

Evaluate formula_27 for formula_28.

We use synthetic division as follows:

 &quot;x&quot;│ &quot;x&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;x&quot;
 3 │ 2 −6 2 −1
 │ 6 0 6
 2 0 2 5

The entries in the third row are the sum of those in the first two. Each entry in the second row is the product of the -value ( in this example) with the third-row entry immediately to the left. The entries in the first row are the coefficients of the polynomial to be evaluated. Then the remainder of formula_29 on division by formula_30 is .

But by the polynomial remainder theorem, we know that the remainder is formula_31. Thus, formula_32.

In this example, if formula_33 we can see that formula_34, the entries in the third row. So, synthetic division (which was actually invented and published by Ruffini 10 years before Horner&#x27;s publication) is easier to use; it can be shown to be equivalent to Horner&#x27;s method.

As a consequence of the polynomial remainder theorem, the entries in the third row are the coefficients of the second-degree polynomial, the quotient of formula_29 on division by formula_36. 
The remainder is . This makes Horner&#x27;s method useful for polynomial long division.

Divide formula_37 by formula_38:

 2 │ 1 −6 11 −6
 │ 2 −8 6
 1 −4 3 0

The quotient is formula_39.

Let formula_40 and formula_41. Divide formula_42 by formula_43 using Horner&#x27;s method.

 0.5 │ 4 −6 0 3 −5
 │ 2 −2 −1 1
 2 −2 −1 1 −4

The third row is the sum of the first two rows, divided by . Each entry in the second row is the product of with the third-row entry to the left. The answer is
formula_44

=== Efficiency ===

Evaluation using the monomial form of a degree formula_2 polynomial requires at most formula_2 additions and formula_47 multiplications, if powers are calculated by repeated multiplication and each monomial is evaluated individually. The cost can be reduced to formula_2 additions and formula_49 multiplications by evaluating the powers of formula_50 by iteration. 

If numerical data are represented in terms of digits (or bits), then the naive algorithm also entails storing approximately formula_51 times the number of bits of formula_50: the evaluated polynomial has approximate magnitude formula_53, and one must also store formula_53 itself. By contrast, Horner&#x27;s method requires only formula_2 additions and formula_2 multiplications, and its storage requirements are only formula_2 times the number of bits of formula_50. Alternatively, Horner&#x27;s method can be computed with formula_2 fused multiply–adds. Horner&#x27;s method can also be extended to evaluate the first formula_60 derivatives of the polynomial with formula_61 additions and multiplications.

Horner&#x27;s method is optimal, in the sense that any algorithm to evaluate an arbitrary polynomial must use at least as many operations. Alexander Ostrowski proved in 1954 that the number of additions required is minimal. Victor Pan proved in 1966 that the number of multiplications is minimal. However, when formula_50 is a matrix, Horner&#x27;s method is not optimal.

This assumes that the polynomial is evaluated in monomial form and no preconditioning of the representation is allowed, which makes sense if the polynomial is evaluated only once. However, if preconditioning is allowed and the polynomial is to be evaluated many times, then faster algorithms are possible. They involve a transformation of the representation of the polynomial. In general, a degree-formula_2 polynomial can be evaluated using only +2 multiplications and formula_2 additions.

====Parallel evaluation====

A disadvantage of Horner&#x27;s rule is that all of the operations are sequentially dependent, so it is not possible to take advantage of instruction level parallelism on modern computers. In most applications where the efficiency of polynomial evaluation matters, many low-order polynomials are evaluated simultaneously (for each pixel or polygon in computer graphics, or for each grid square in a numerical simulation), so it is not necessary to find parallelism within a single polynomial evaluation.

If, however, one is evaluating a single polynomial of very high order, it may be useful to break it up as follows:
formula_65

More generally, the summation can be broken into &quot;k&quot; parts:
formula_66
where the inner summations may be evaluated using separate parallel instances of Horner&#x27;s method. This requires slightly more operations than the basic Horner&#x27;s method, but allows &quot;k&quot;-way SIMD execution of most of them. Modern compilers generally evaluate polynomials this way when advantageous, although for floating-point calculations this requires enabling (unsafe) reassociative math.

===Application to floating-point multiplication and division===
Horner&#x27;s method is a fast, code-efficient method for multiplication and division of binary numbers on a microcontroller with no hardware multiplier. One of the binary numbers to be multiplied is represented as a trivial polynomial, where (using the above notation) formula_67, and formula_68. Then, &quot;x&quot; (or &quot;x&quot; to some power) is repeatedly factored out. In this binary numeral system (base 2), formula_68, so powers of 2 are repeatedly factored out.

====Example====
For example, to find the product of two numbers (0.15625) and &quot;m&quot;:
formula_70

====Method====
To find the product of two binary numbers &quot;d&quot; and &quot;m&quot;:
# A register holding the intermediate result is initialized to &quot;d&quot;.
# Begin with the least significant (rightmost) non-zero bit in &quot;m&quot;. 
# If all the non-zero bits were counted, then the intermediate result register now holds the final result. Otherwise, add d to the intermediate result, and continue in step 2 with the next most significant bit in &quot;m&quot;.

====Derivation====
In general, for a binary number with bit values (formula_71) the product is
formula_72
At this stage in the algorithm, it is required that terms with zero-valued coefficients are dropped, so that only binary coefficients equal to one are counted, thus the problem of multiplication or division by zero is not an issue, despite this implication in the factored equation:
formula_73

The denominators all equal one (or the term is absent), so this reduces to
formula_74
or equivalently (as consistent with the &quot;method&quot; described above)
formula_75

In binary (base-2) math, multiplication by a power of 2 is merely a register shift operation. Thus, multiplying by 2 is calculated in base-2 by an arithmetic shift. The factor (2−1) is a right arithmetic shift, a (0) results in no operation (since 20 = 1 is the multiplicative identity element), and a (21) results in a left arithmetic shift.
The multiplication product can now be quickly calculated using only arithmetic shift operations, addition and subtraction.

The method is particularly fast on processors supporting a single-instruction shift-and-addition-accumulate. Compared to a C floating-point library, Horner&#x27;s method sacrifices some accuracy, however it is nominally 13 times faster (16 times faster when the &quot;canonical signed digit&quot; (CSD) form is used) and uses only 20% of the code space.

=== Other applications ===

Horner&#x27;s method can be used to convert between different positional numeral systems – in which case &quot;x&quot; is the base of the number system, and the &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; coefficients are the digits of the base-&quot;x&quot; representation of a given number – and can also be used if &quot;x&quot; is a matrix, in which case the gain in computational efficiency is even greater. However, for such cases faster methods are known.

== Polynomial root finding ==
Using the long division algorithm in combination with Newton&#x27;s method, it is possible to approximate the real roots of a polynomial. The algorithm works as follows. Given a polynomial formula_76 of degree formula_2 with zeros formula_78 make some initial guess formula_79 such that formula_80. Now iterate the following two steps:

# Using Newton&#x27;s method, find the largest zero formula_81 of formula_76 using the guess formula_6.
# Using Horner&#x27;s method, divide out formula_84 to obtain formula_85. Return to step 1 but use the polynomial formula_85 and the initial guess formula_81.

These two steps are repeated until all real zeros are found for the polynomial. If the approximated zeros are not precise enough, the obtained values can be used as initial guesses for Newton&#x27;s method but using the full polynomial rather than the reduced polynomials.

=== Example ===

Consider the polynomial
formula_88
which can be expanded to
formula_89

From the above we know that the largest root of this polynomial is 7 so we are able to make an initial guess of 8. Using Newton&#x27;s method the first zero of 7 is found as shown in black in the figure to the right. Next formula_17 is divided by formula_91 to obtain
formula_92
which is drawn in red in the figure to the right. Newton&#x27;s method is used to find the largest zero of this polynomial with an initial guess of 7. The largest zero of this polynomial which corresponds to the second largest zero of the original polynomial is found at 3 and is circled in red. The degree 5 polynomial is now divided by formula_93 to obtain
formula_94
which is shown in yellow. The zero for this polynomial is found at 2 again using Newton&#x27;s method and is circled in yellow. Horner&#x27;s method is now used to obtain
formula_95
which is shown in green and found to have a zero at −3. This polynomial is further reduced to
formula_96
which is shown in blue and yields a zero of −5. The final root of the original polynomial may be found by either using the final zero as an initial guess for Newton&#x27;s method, or by reducing formula_97 and solving the linear equation. As can be seen, the expected roots of −8, −5, −3, 2, 3, and 7 were found.

== Divided difference of a polynomial ==

Horner&#x27;s method can be modified to compute the divided difference formula_98 Given the polynomial (as before)
formula_4
proceed as follows
formula_100

At completion, we have
formula_101
This computation of the divided difference is subject to less round-off error than evaluating formula_17 and formula_103 separately, particularly when formula_104. Substituting formula_105 in this method gives formula_106, the derivative of formula_17.

== History ==

Horner&#x27;s paper, titled &quot;A new method of solving numerical equations of all orders, by continuous approximation&quot;, was read before the Royal Society of London, at its meeting on July 1, 1819, with a sequel in 1823. Horner&#x27;s paper in Part II of &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London&quot; for 1819 was warmly and expansively welcomed by a reviewer in the issue of &quot;The Monthly Review: or, Literary Journal&quot; for April, 1820; in comparison, a technical paper by Charles Babbage is dismissed curtly in this review. The sequence of reviews in &quot;The Monthly Review&quot; for September, 1821, concludes that Holdred was the first person to discover a direct and general practical solution of numerical equations. Fuller showed that the method in Horner&#x27;s 1819 paper differs from what afterwards became known as &quot;Horner&#x27;s method&quot; and that in consequence the priority for this method should go to Holdred (1820).

Unlike his English contemporaries, Horner drew on the Continental literature, notably the work of Arbogast. Horner is also known to have made a close reading of John Bonneycastle&#x27;s book on algebra, though he neglected the work of Paolo Ruffini.

Although Horner is credited with making the method accessible and practical, it was known long before Horner. In reverse chronological order, Horner&#x27;s method was already known to:

* Paolo Ruffini in 1809 (see Ruffini&#x27;s rule)
* Isaac Newton in 1669
* the Chinese mathematician Zhu Shijie in the 14th century
* the Chinese mathematician Qin Jiushao in his &quot;Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections&quot; in the 13th century
* the Persian mathematician Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī in the 12th century (the first to use that method in a general case of cubic equation)
* the Chinese mathematician Jia Xian in the 11th century (Song dynasty)
* &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot;, a Chinese work of the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) edited by Liu Hui (fl. 3rd century).

Qin Jiushao, in his &quot;Shu Shu Jiu Zhang&quot; (&quot;Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections&quot;; 1247), presents a portfolio of methods of Horner-type for solving polynomial equations, which was based on earlier works of the 11th century Song dynasty mathematician Jia Xian; for example, one method is specifically suited to bi-quintics, of which Qin gives an instance, in keeping with the then Chinese custom of case studies. Yoshio Mikami in &quot;Development of Mathematics in China and Japan&quot; (Leipzig 1913) wrote:
Ulrich Libbrecht concluded: &quot;It is obvious that this procedure is a Chinese invention ... the method was not known in India&quot;. He said, Fibonacci probably learned of it from Arabs, who perhaps borrowed from the Chinese. The extraction of square and cube roots along similar lines is already discussed by Liu Hui in connection with Problems IV.16 and 22 in &quot;Jiu Zhang Suan Shu&quot;, while Wang Xiaotong in the 7th century supposes his readers can solve cubics by an approximation method described in his book Jigu Suanjing.

<text>&quot;Hapworth 16, 1924&quot; is an uncollected work of short fiction by J. D. Salinger that appeared in the June 19, 1965, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

The story is the last original work Salinger published during his lifetime, and filled almost the entire magazine. It is the &quot;youngest&quot; of his Glass family stories, in the sense that the narrated events happen chronologically before those in the rest of the series.

==Plot==

46-year-old Buddy Glass reproduces the contents of a letter written by his older brother Seymour, who died by suicide 17 years earlier in 1948. Seymour wrote the letter to their parents while he and Buddy (two years his junior) were attending Camp Simon Hapworth, Maine, in 1924. The literary voice conveyed in the letter is that of a highly articulate and strikingly precocious boy of seven. The letter, written from the camp infirmary (Seymour has injured his leg) is a wide-ranging commentary on the camp personnel, the camp attendees, and his relationships with his family, humanity and God. Seymour and Buddy largely prefer to occupy themselves writing poems and short stories rather than participate in group activities. They therefore meet with some hostility.

Seymour devotes a large part of the letter to enumerating his reading list and requests for further reading material from his parents. He offers critical appraisals of a number of major literary figures. The letter closes with a lengthy discourse on the significance of God.

==Publishing history==
The circumstances and considerations that led chief fiction editor William Shawn at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; to devote virtually the entire June 19, 1965, edition to &quot;Hapworth 16, 1924&quot; are obscure. Biographer Kenneth Slawenki writes, &quot;the files of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; are unusually silent on the details of the novella&#x27;s reception by the editorial staff and its eventual reception by William Shawn.&quot; The correspondence between Salinger and Shawn chronicling the decision may have been deliberately suppressed. Slawenski speculates that the appearance of Salinger&#x27;s piece in the journal was &quot;a &quot;fait accompli&quot; rather than a topic of debate&quot;.

After the story&#x27;s appearance in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Salinger—who had already withdrawn to his New Hampshire home—stopped publishing altogether. Since the story never appeared in book form, readers had to seek out that issue or find it on microfilm. Finally, with the release of &quot;The Complete New Yorker&quot; on DVD in 2005, the story was once again widely available.

In 1996, Orchises Press, a small Virginia publishing house, started a process of publishing &quot;Hapworth&quot; in book form. Orchises Press owner Roger Lathbury has described the effort in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and, three months after Salinger&#x27;s death, in &quot;New York&quot; magazine&quot;.&quot; According to Lathbury, Salinger was deeply concerned with the proposed book&#x27;s appearance, even visiting Washington to examine the cloth for the binding. Salinger also sent Lathbury numerous &quot;infectious and delightful and loving&quot; letters.

Following publishing norms, Lathbury applied for Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication data, unaware of how publicly available the information would be. A writer in Seattle, researching an article on Jeff Bezos, came across the &quot;Hapworth&quot; publication date, and told his sister, a journalist for the &quot;Washington Business Journal&quot;, who wrote an article about the upcoming book. This led to substantial coverage in the press. Shortly before the books were to be shipped, Salinger changed his mind, and Orchises withdrew the book. New publication dates were repeatedly announced, but it never appeared. Lathbury said, &quot;I never reached back out. I thought about writing some letters, but it wouldn&#x27;t have done any good.&quot;

==Reception and assessment==
Both contemporary and later literary critics harshly panned &quot;Hapworth 16, 1924&quot;; writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Michiko Kakutani called it &quot;a sour, implausible and, sad to say, completely charmless story ... filled with digressions, narcissistic asides and ridiculous shaggy-dog circumlocutions.&quot;

Calling it &quot;virtually unreadable&quot; and &quot;an enigma&quot;, critic John Wenke compares &quot;Hapworth&quot; to viewing a neighbor&#x27;s unedited family home movies. He writes:

Wenke adds that the story is a striking departure from the &quot;urbane, pithy and wry&quot; short fiction &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s editors and readership favored.

Biographer Kenneth Slawenski considers the piece &quot;professionally, a disaster&quot; and ponders what may have motivated Salinger to submit the work for publication:

Biographer Ian Hamilton concurs that Salinger appears to abandon his loyal readership and retreat into the exclusive realm of his characters. He writes, &quot;The Glass family has, in this last story, become Salinger&#x27;s subject and his readership, his creatures and his companions. His life is finally made one with art.&quot;

Salinger is said to have considered the story a &quot;high point of his writing&quot; and made tentative steps to have it reprinted, though those came to nothing.

<doc id="14269" wikidata="Q62962" url="?curid=14269" title="Hypnotic">
<text>Hypnotic (from Greek &quot;Hypnos&quot;, sleep), or soporific drugs, commonly known as sleeping pills, are a class of (and umbrella term for) psychoactive drugs whose primary function is to induce sleep (or surgical anesthesia) and to treat insomnia (sleeplessness).

This group of drugs is related to sedatives&quot;. &quot;Whereas the term sedative describes drugs that serve to calm or relieve anxiety, the term hypnotic generally describes drugs whose main purpose is to initiate, sustain, or lengthen sleep. Because these two functions frequently overlap, and because drugs in this class generally produce dose-dependent effects (ranging from anxiolysis to loss of consciousness), they are often referred to collectively as sedative–hypnotic drugs.

Hypnotic drugs are regularly prescribed for insomnia and other sleep disorders, with over 95% of insomnia patients being prescribed hypnotics in some countries. Many hypnotic drugs are habit-forming and—due to many factors known to disturb the human sleep pattern—a physician may instead recommend changes in the environment before and during sleep, better sleep hygiene, the avoidance of caffeine and alcohol or other stimulating substances, or behavioral interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), before prescribing medication for sleep. When prescribed, hypnotic medication should be used for the shortest period of time necessary.

Among individuals with sleep disorders, 13.7% are taking or prescribed nonbenzodiazepines, while 10.8% are taking benzodiazepines, as of 2010, in the USA. Early classes of drugs, such as barbiturates, have fallen out of use in most practices but are still prescribed for some patients. In children, prescribing hypnotics is not yet acceptable—unless used to treat night terrors or sleepwalking. Elderly people are more sensitive to potential side effects of daytime fatigue and cognitive impairments, and a meta-analysis found that the risks generally outweigh any marginal benefits of hypnotics in the elderly. A review of the literature regarding benzodiazepine hypnotics and Z-drugs concluded that these drugs can have adverse effects, such as dependence and accidents, and that optimal treatment uses the lowest effective dose for the shortest therapeutic time period, with gradual discontinuation in order to improve health without worsening of sleep.

Falling outside the above-mentioned categories, the neurohormone melatonin and its analogues (such as ramelteon) serve a hypnotic function.

Hypnotica was a class of somniferous drugs and substances tested in medicine of the 1890s and later. These include Urethan, Acetal, Methylal, Sulfonal, Paraldehyde, Amylenhydrate, Hypnon, Chloralurethan and Ohloralamid or Chloralimid.

Research about using medications to treat insomnia evolved throughout the last half of the 20th century. Treatment for insomnia in psychiatry dates back to 1869, when chloral hydrate was first used as a soporific. Barbiturates emerged as the first class of drugs in the early 1900s, after which chemical substitution allowed derivative compounds. Although they were the best drug family at the time (with less toxicity and fewer side effects), they were dangerous in overdose and tended to cause physical and psychological dependence.

During the 1970s, quinazolinones and benzodiazepines were introduced as safer alternatives to replace barbiturates; by the late 1970s, benzodiazepines emerged as the safer drug.

Benzodiazepines are not without their drawbacks; substance dependence is possible, and deaths from overdoses sometimes occur, especially in combination with alcohol and/or other depressants. Questions have been raised as to whether they disturb sleep architecture.

Nonbenzodiazepines are the most recent development (1990s–present). Although it is clear that they are less toxic than barbiturates, their predecessors, comparative efficacy over benzodiazepines have not been established. Such efficacy is hard to determine without longitudinal studies. However, some psychiatrists recommend these drugs, citing research suggesting they are equally potent with less potential for abuse.

Other sleep remedies that may be considered &quot;sedative–hypnotics&quot; exist; psychiatrists will sometimes prescribe medicines off-label if they have sedating effects. Examples of these include mirtazapine (an antidepressant), clonidine (an older antihypertensive drug), quetiapine (an antipsychotic), and the over-the-counter allergy and antiemetic medications doxylamine and diphenhydramine. Off-label sleep remedies are particularly useful when first-line treatment is unsuccessful or deemed unsafe (as in patients with a history of substance abuse).

==Types==
===Barbiturates===

Barbiturates are drugs that act as central nervous system depressants, and can therefore produce a wide spectrum of effects, from mild sedation to total anesthesia. They are also effective as anxiolytics, hypnotics, and anticonvulsalgesic effects; however, these effects are somewhat weak, preventing barbiturates from being used in surgery in the absence of other analgesics. They have dependence liability, both physical and psychological. Barbiturates have now largely been replaced by benzodiazepines in routine medical practice – such as in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia – mainly because benzodiazepines are significantly less dangerous in overdose. However, barbiturates are still used in general anesthesia, for epilepsy, and for assisted suicide. Barbiturates are derivatives of barbituric acid.

The principal mechanism of action of barbiturates is believed to be positive allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors.

Examples include amobarbital, pentobarbital, phenobarbital, secobarbital, and sodium thiopental.

===Quinazolinones===

Quinazolinones are also a class of drugs which function as hypnotic/sedatives that contain a 4-quinazolinone core. Their use has also been proposed in the treatment of cancer.

Examples of quinazolinones include cloroqualone, diproqualone, etaqualone (Aolan, Athinazone, Ethinazone), mebroqualone, Afloqualone (Arofuto), mecloqualone (Nubarene, Casfen), and methaqualone (Quaalude).

===Benzodiazepines===

Benzodiazepines can be useful for short-term treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due to the risk of dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently—and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. Like alcohol, benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat insomnia in the short-term (both prescribed and self-medicated), but worsen sleep in the long-term. While benzodiazepines can put people to sleep (i.e., inhibit NREM stage 1 and 2 sleep), while asleep, the drugs disrupt sleep architecture by decreasing sleep time, delaying time to REM sleep, and decreasing deep slow-wave sleep (the most restorative part of sleep for both energy and mood).

Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation. The list of benzodiazepines approved for the treatment of insomnia is fairly similar among most countries, but which benzodiazepines are officially designated as first-line hypnotics prescribed for the treatment of insomnia can vary distinctly between countries. Longer-acting benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam and diazepam have residual effects that may persist into the next day and are, in general, not recommended.

It is not clear as to whether the new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (Z-drugs) are better than the short-acting benzodiazepines. The efficacy of these two groups of medications is similar. According to the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, indirect comparison indicates that side-effects from benzodiazepines may be about twice as frequent as from nonbenzodiazepines. Some experts suggest using nonbenzodiazepines preferentially as a first-line long-term treatment of insomnia. However, the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) did not find any convincing evidence in favor of Z-drugs. A NICE review pointed out that short-acting Z-drugs were inappropriately compared in clinical trials with long-acting benzodiazepines. There have been no trials comparing short-acting Z-drugs with appropriate doses of short-acting benzodiazepines. Based on this, NICE recommended choosing the hypnotic based on cost and the patient&#x27;s preference.

Older adults should not use benzodiazepines to treat insomnia—unless other treatments have failed to be effective. When benzodiazepines are used, patients, their caretakers, and their physician should discuss the increased risk of harms, including evidence which shows twice the incidence of traffic collisions among driving patients, as well as falls and hip fracture for all older patients.

Their mechanism of action is primarily at GABAA receptors.

===Nonbenzodiazepines===
Nonbenzodiazepines are a class of psychoactive drugs that are very &quot;benzodiazepine-like&quot; in nature. Nonbenzodiazepine pharmacodynamics are almost entirely the same as benzodiazepine drugs, and therefore entail similar benefits, side-effects and risks. Nonbenzodiazepines, however, have dissimilar or entirely different chemical structures, and therefore are unrelated to benzodiazepines on a molecular level.

Examples include zopiclone (Imovane, Zimovane), eszopiclone (Lunesta), zaleplon (Sonata), and zolpidem (Ambien, Stilnox, Stilnoct). Since the generic names of all drugs of this type start with Z, they are often referred to as Z-drugs.

Research on nonbenzodiazepines is new and conflicting. A review by a team of researchers suggests the use of these drugs for people that have trouble falling asleep (but not staying asleep), as next-day impairments were minimal. The team noted that the safety of these drugs had been established, but called for more research into their long-term effectiveness in treating insomnia. Other evidence suggests that tolerance to nonbenzodiazepines may be slower to develop than with benzodiazepines. A different team was more skeptical, finding little benefit over benzodiazepines.

===Others===

====Melatonin====
Melatonin, the hormone produced in the pineal gland in the brain and secreted in dim light and darkness, among its other functions, promotes sleep in diurnal mammals.

Synthetic analogues of melatonin, or melatonin receptor agonists, have also been made. Among these, ramelteon and tasimelteon are used for sleep-related disorders. Agomelatine is an antidepressant of this class, with some studies also reporting an effect on sleep. 

====Antihistamines====

In common use, the term &quot;antihistamine&quot; refers only to compounds that inhibit action at the H1 receptor (and not H2, etc.).

Clinically, H1 antagonists are used to treat certain allergies. Sedation is a common side-effect, and some H1 antagonists, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and doxylamine, are also used to treat insomnia.

Second-generation antihistamines cross the blood–brain barrier to a much lower degree than the first ones. This results in their primarily affecting peripheral histamine receptors, and therefore having a much lower sedative effect. High doses can still induce the central nervous system effect of drowsiness.

====Antidepressants====
Some antidepressants have sedating effects.

Examples include:

; Serotonin antagonists and reuptake inhibitors
* Trazodone
; Tricyclic antidepressants
* Amitriptyline
* Doxepin
* Trimipramine
; Tetracyclic antidepressants
* Mianserin
* Mirtazapine

====Antipsychotics====
While some of these drugs are frequently prescribed for insomnia, such use is not recommended unless the insomnia is due to an underlying mental health condition treatable by antipsychotics as the risks frequently outweigh the benefits. Some of the more serious adverse effects have been observed to occur at the low doses used for this off-label prescribing, such as dyslipidemia and neutropenia, and a recent network meta-analysis of 154 double-blind, randomized controlled trials of drug therapies vs. placebo for insomnia in adults found that quetiapine had not demonstrated any short-term benefits in sleep quality. Examples of antipsychotics with sedation as a side effect that are occasionally used for insomnia:

; First-generation
* Chlorpromazine
; Second-generation
* Clozapine
* Olanzapine
* Quetiapine
* Risperidone
* Zotepine
* Ziprasidone

====Miscellaneous drugs====
; Alpha-adrenergic agonist
* Clonidine
* Guanfacine

; Cannabinoids
* Cannabidiol
* Tetrahydrocannabinol

; Orexin receptor antagonist
* Suvorexant
* Lemborexant
* Daridorexant

; Gabapentinoids
* Gabapentin
* Pregabalin
* Phenibut

==Effectiveness==
A major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia was published in 2022. It found a wide range of effect sizes (standardized mean difference (SMD)) in terms of efficacy for insomnia. The assessed medications included benzodiazepines (e.g., temazepam, triazolam, many others) (SMDs 0.58 to 0.83), Z-drugs (eszopiclone, zaleplon, zolpidem, zopiclone) (SMDs 0.03 to 0.63), sedative antidepressants and antihistamines (doxepin, doxylamine, trazodone, trimipramine) (SMDs 0.30 to 0.55), the antipsychotic quetiapine (SMD 0.07), orexin receptor antagonists (daridorexant, lemborexant, seltorexant, suvorexant) (SMDs 0.23 to 0.44), and melatonin receptor agonists (melatonin, ramelteon) (SMDs 0.00 to 0.13). The certainty of evidence varied and ranged from high to very low depending on the medication. Certain medications often used as hypnotics, including the antihistamines diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, and promethazine and the antidepressants amitriptyline and mirtazapine, were not included in analyses due to insufficient data.

==Risks==
The use of sedative medications in older people generally should be avoided. These medications are associated with poorer health outcomes, including cognitive decline, and bone fractures.

Therefore, sedatives and hypnotics should be avoided in people with dementia, according to the clinical guidelines known as the Medication Appropriateness Tool for Comorbid Health Conditions in Dementia (MATCH-D). The use of these medications can further impede cognitive function for people with dementia, who are also more sensitive to side effects of medications.

<text>HMS &quot;Dunraven&quot; was a Q-Ship of the Royal Navy during World War I.

On 8 August 1917, 130 miles southwest of Ushant in the Bay of Biscay, disguised as the collier &quot;Boverton&quot; and commanded by Gordon Campbell, VC, &quot;Dunraven&quot; spotted , commanded by &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Reinhold Saltzwedel. Saltzwedel believed the disguised ship was a merchant vessel. The U-boat submerged and closed with &quot;Dunraven&quot; before surfacing astern at 11:43 am and opening fire at long range. &quot;Dunraven&quot; made smoke and sent off a panic party (a small number of men who &quot;abandon ship&quot; during an attack to continue the impersonation of a merchant).

Shells began hitting &quot;Dunraven&quot;, detonating her depth charges and setting her stern afire. Her crew remained hidden letting the fires burn. Then a 4-inch (102 mm) gun and crew were blown away revealing &quot;Dunraven&quot;″s identity as a warship, and &quot;UC-71&quot; submerged. A second &quot;panic party&quot; abandoned ship. &quot;Dunraven&quot; was hit by a torpedo. A third &quot;panic party&quot; went over the side, leaving only two guns manned. &quot;UC-71&quot; surfaced, shelled &quot;Dunraven&quot; and again submerged. Campbell replied with two torpedoes that missed, and around 3 pm, the undamaged U-boat left that area. Only one of &quot;Dunraven&quot;″s crew was killed, but the Q-Ship was sinking.

The British destroyer HMS &quot;Christopher&quot; picked up &quot;Dunraven&quot;″s survivors and took her in tow for Plymouth, but &quot;Dunraven&quot; sank at 1:30 am early on 10 August 1917 to the north of Ushant.

In recognition, two Victoria Crosses were awarded, one to the ship&#x27;s First Lieutenant, Lt. Charles George Bonner RNR, and the other, by ballot, to a gunlayer, Petty Officer Ernest Herbert Pitcher.

Captain Campbell later wrote:
:&quot;It had been a fair and honest fight, and I lost it. Referring to my crew, words cannot express what I am feeling. No one let me down. No one could have done better.&quot;

Captain Campbell had been previously awarded the Victoria Cross, in February 1917, for the sinking of .

<doc id="14275" wikidata="Q979090" url="?curid=14275" title="Hacker ethic">
<text>The hacker ethic is a philosophy and set of moral values within hacker culture. Practitioners believe that sharing information and data with others is an ethical imperative. The hacker ethic is related to the concept of freedom of information, as well as the political theories of anti-authoritarianism, anarchism, and libertarianism.

While some tenets of the hacker ethic were described in other texts like &quot;Computer Lib/Dream Machines&quot; (1974) by Ted Nelson, the term &quot;hacker ethic&quot; is generally attributed to journalist Steven Levy, who appears to have been the first to document both the philosophy and the founders of the philosophy in his 1984 book titled &quot;.&quot;

==History==
The hacker ethic originated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1950s–1960s. The term &quot;hacker&quot; has long been used there to describe college pranks that MIT students would regularly devise, and was used more generally to describe a project undertaken or a product built to fulfill some constructive goal, but also out of pleasure for mere involvement.

MIT housed an early IBM 704 computer inside the Electronic Accounting Machinery (EAM) room in 1959. This room became the staging grounds for early hackers, as MIT students from the Tech Model Railroad Club sneaked inside the EAM room after hours to attempt programming the 30-ton, computer.

The hacker ethic was described as a &quot;new way of life, with a philosophy, an ethic and a dream&quot;. However, the elements of the hacker ethic were not openly debated and discussed; rather they were implicitly accepted and silently agreed upon.

The free software movement was born in the early 1980s from followers of the hacker ethic. Its founder, Richard Stallman, is referred to by Steven Levy as &quot;the last true hacker&quot;.

Richard Stallman describes:

&quot;The hacker ethic refers to the feelings of right and wrong, to the ethical ideas this community of people had—that knowledge should be shared with other people who can benefit from it, and that important resources should be utilized rather than wasted.&quot;

and states more precisely that hacking (which Stallman defines as playful cleverness) and ethics are two separate issues:

&quot;Just because someone enjoys hacking does not mean he has an ethical commitment to treating other people properly. Some hackers care about ethics—I do, for instance—but that is not part of being a hacker, it is a separate trait. [...] Hacking is not primarily about an ethical issue. [...] hacking tends to lead a significant number of hackers to think about ethical questions in a certain way. I would not want to completely deny all connection between hacking and views on ethics.&quot;The hacker culture has been compared to early Protestantism . Protestant sectarians emphasized individualism and loneliness, similar to hackers who have been considered loners and nonjudgmental individuals. The notion of moral indifference between hackers characterized the persistent actions of computer culture in the 1970s and early 1980s. According to Kirkpatrick, author of &quot;The Hacker Ethic&quot;, the &quot;computer plays the role of God, whose requirements took priority over the human ones of sentiment when it came to assessing one&#x27;s duty to others.&quot;
According to Kirkpatrick&#x27;s &quot;The Hacker Ethic:&quot;

&quot;Exceptional single-mindedness and determination to keep plugging away at a problem until the optimal solution had been found are well-documented traits of the early hackers. Willingness to work right through the night on a single programming problem are widely cited as features of the early &#x27;hacker&#x27; computer culture.&quot; 

The hacker culture is placed in the context of 1960s youth culture when American youth culture challenged the concept of capitalism and big, centralized structures. The hacker culture was a subculture within 1960s counterculture. The hackers&#x27; main concern was challenging the idea of technological expertise and authority. The 1960s hippy period attempted to &quot;overturn the machine.&quot; Although hackers appreciated technology, they wanted regular citizens, and not big corporations, to have power over technology &quot;as a weapon that might actually undermine the authority of the expert and the hold of the monolithic system.&quot;

==The hacker ethics==
As Levy summarized in the preface of &quot;Hackers&quot;, the general tenets or principles of hacker ethic include:

* Sharing
* Openness
* Decentralization
* Free access to computers
* World Improvement (foremost, upholding democracy and the fundamental laws we all live by, as a society)

In addition to those principles, Levy also described more specific hacker ethics and beliefs in chapter 2, &quot;The Hacker Ethic&quot;: The ethics he described in chapter 2 are:

;1. &quot;Access to computers—and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!&quot;: Levy is recounting hackers&#x27; abilities to learn and build upon pre-existing ideas and systems. He believes that access gives hackers the opportunity to take things apart, fix, or improve upon them and to learn and understand how they work. This gives them the knowledge to create new and even more interesting things. Access aids the expansion of technology.
;2. &quot;All information should be free&quot;: Linking directly with the principle of access, information needs to be free for hackers to fix, improve, and reinvent systems. A free exchange of information allows for greater overall creativity. In the hacker viewpoint, any system could benefit from an easy flow of information, a concept known as transparency in the social sciences. As Stallman notes, &quot;free&quot; refers to unrestricted access; it does not refer to price.
;3. &quot;Mistrust authority—promote decentralization&quot;: The best way to promote the free exchange of information is to have an open system that presents no boundaries between a hacker and a piece of information or an item of equipment that they need in their quest for knowledge, improvement, and time on-line. Hackers believe that bureaucracies, whether corporate, government, or university, are flawed systems.
;4. &quot;Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position&quot;: Inherent in the hacker ethic is a meritocratic system where superficiality is disregarded in esteem of skill. Levy articulates that criteria such as age, race, position, and qualification are deemed irrelevant within the hacker community. Hacker skill is the ultimate determinant of acceptance. Such a code within the hacker community fosters the advance of hacking and software development.
;5. &quot;You can create art and beauty on a computer&quot;: Hackers deeply appreciate innovative techniques which allow programs to perform complicated tasks with few instructions. A program&#x27;s code was considered to hold a beauty of its own, having been carefully composed and artfully arranged. Learning to create programs which used the least amount of space almost became a game between the early hackers.
;6. &quot;Computers can change your life for the better&quot;: Hackers felt that computers had enriched their lives, given their lives focus, and made their lives adventurous. Hackers regarded computers as Aladdin&#x27;s lamps that they could control. They believed that everyone in society could benefit from experiencing such power and that if everyone could interact with computers in the way that hackers did, then the hacker ethic might spread through society and computers would improve the world. The hackers succeeded in turning dreams of endless possibilities into realities. The hacker&#x27;s primary object was to teach society that &quot;the world opened up by the computer was a limitless one&quot; (Levy 230:1984)

===Sharing===
From the early days of modern computing through to the 1970s, it was far more common for computer users to have the freedoms that are provided by an ethic of open sharing and collaboration. Software, including source code, was commonly shared by individuals who used computers. Most companies had a business model based on hardware sales, and provided or bundled the associated software free of charge. According to Levy&#x27;s account, sharing was the norm and expected within the non-corporate hacker culture. The principle of sharing stemmed from the open atmosphere and informal access to resources at MIT. During the early days of computers and programming, the hackers at MIT would develop a program and share it with other computer users.

If the hack was deemed particularly good, then the program might be posted on a board somewhere near one of the computers. Other programs that could be built upon it and improved it were saved to tapes and added to a drawer of programs, readily accessible to all the other hackers. At any time, a fellow hacker might reach into the drawer, pick out the program, and begin adding to it or &quot;bumming&quot; it to make it better. Bumming referred to the process of making the code more concise so that more can be done in fewer instructions, saving precious memory for further enhancements.

In the second generation of hackers, sharing was about sharing with the general public in addition to sharing with other hackers. A particular organization of hackers that was concerned with sharing computers with the general public was a group called Community Memory. This group of hackers and idealists put computers in public places for anyone to use. The first community computer was placed outside of Leopold&#x27;s Records in Berkeley, California.

Another sharing of resources occurred when Bob Albrecht provided considerable resources for a non-profit organization called the People&#x27;s Computer Company (PCC). PCC opened a computer center where anyone could use the computers there for fifty cents per hour.

This second generation practice of sharing contributed to the battles of free and open software. In fact, when Bill Gates&#x27; version of BASIC for the Altair was shared among the hacker community, Gates claimed to have lost a considerable sum of money because few users paid for the software. As a result, Gates wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists. This letter was published by several computer magazines and newsletters, most notably that of the Homebrew Computer Club where much of the sharing occurred.

According to Brent K. Jesiek in &quot;Democratizing Software: Open Source, the Hacker Ethic, and Beyond,&quot; technology is being associated with social views and goals. Jesiek refers to Gisle Hannemyr&#x27;s views on open source vs. commercialized software. Hannemyr concludes that when a hacker constructs software, the software is flexible, tailorable, modular in nature and is open-ended. A hacker&#x27;s software contrasts mainstream hardware which favors control, a sense of being whole, and be immutable (Hannemyr, 1999).

Furthermore, he concludes that &#x27;the difference between the hacker’s approach and those of the industrial programmer is one of outlook: between an agoric, integrated and holistic attitude towards the creation of artifacts and a proprietary, fragmented and reductionist one&#x27; (Hannemyr, 1999). As Hannemyr’s analysis reveals, the characteristics of a given piece of software frequently reflect the attitude and outlook of the programmers and organizations from which it emerges.&quot;

===Copyright and patents===

As copyright and patent laws limit the ability to share software, opposition to software patents is widespread in the hacker and free software community.

===Hands-On Imperative===
Many of the principles and tenets of hacker ethic contribute to a common goal: the Hands-On Imperative. As Levy described in Chapter 2, &quot;Hackers believe that essential lessons can be learned about the systems—about the world—from taking things apart, seeing how they work, and using this knowledge to create new and more interesting things.&quot;

Employing the Hands-On Imperative requires free access, open information, and the sharing of knowledge. To a true hacker, if the Hands-On Imperative is restricted, then the ends justify the means to make it unrestricted &quot;so that improvements can be made&quot;. When these principles are not present, hackers tend to work around them. For example, when the computers at MIT were protected either by physical locks or login programs, the hackers there systematically worked around them in order to have access to the machines. Hackers assumed a &quot;willful blindness&quot; in the pursuit of perfection.

This behavior was not malicious in nature: the MIT hackers did not seek to harm the systems or their users. This deeply contrasts with the modern, media-encouraged image of hackers who crack secure systems in order to steal information or complete an act of cyber-vandalism.

===Community and collaboration===
Throughout writings about hackers and their work processes, a common value of community and collaboration is present. For example, in Levy&#x27;s &quot;Hackers&quot;, each generation of hackers had geographically based communities where collaboration and sharing occurred. For the hackers at MIT, it was the labs where the computers were running. For the hardware hackers (second generation) and the game hackers (third generation) the geographic area was centered in Silicon Valley where the Homebrew Computer Club and the People&#x27;s Computer Company helped hackers network, collaborate, and share their work.

The concept of community and collaboration is still relevant today, although hackers are no longer limited to collaboration in geographic regions. Now collaboration takes place via the Internet. Eric S. Raymond identifies and explains this conceptual shift in &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;:

Before cheap Internet, there were some geographically compact communities where the culture encouraged Weinberg&#x27;s egoless programming, and a developer could easily attract a lot of skilled kibitzers and co-developers. Bell Labs, the MIT AI and LCS labs, UC Berkeley: these became the home of innovations that are legendary and still potent.

Raymond also notes that the success of Linux coincided with the wide availability of the World Wide Web. The value of community is still in high practice and use today.

==Levy&#x27;s &quot;true hackers&quot;==
Levy identifies several &quot;true hackers&quot; who significantly influenced the hacker ethic. Some well-known &quot;true hackers&quot; include:

* Bill Gosper: Mathematician and hacker
* Richard Greenblatt: Programmer and early designer of LISP machines
* John McCarthy: Co-founder of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Stanford AI Laboratory
* Jude Milhon: Founder of the cypherpunk movement, senior editor at &quot;Mondo 2000&quot;, and co-founder of Community Memory
* Richard Stallman: Programmer and political activist who is well known for GNU, Emacs and the Free Software Movement

Levy also identified the &quot;hardware hackers&quot; (the &quot;second generation&quot;, mostly centered in Silicon Valley) and the &quot;game hackers&quot; (or the &quot;third generation&quot;). All three generations of hackers, according to Levy, embodied the principles of the hacker ethic. Some of Levy&#x27;s &quot;second-generation&quot; hackers include:

* Steve Dompier: Homebrew Computer Club member and hacker who worked with the early Altair 8800
* John Draper: A legendary figure in the computer programming world. He wrote EasyWriter, the first word processor.
* Lee Felsenstein: A hardware hacker and co-founder of Community Memory and Homebrew Computer Club; a designer of the Sol-20 computer
* Bob Marsh: A designer of the Sol-20 computer
* Fred Moore: Activist and founder of the Homebrew Computer Club
* Steve Wozniak: One of the founders of Apple Computer

Levy&#x27;s &quot;third generation&quot; practitioners of hacker ethic include:

* John Harris: One of the first programmers hired at On-Line Systems (which later became Sierra Entertainment)
* Ken Williams: Along with wife Roberta, founded On-Line Systems after working at IBM – the company would later achieve mainstream popularity as Sierra.

==Other descriptions==
In 2001, Finnish philosopher Pekka Himanen promoted the hacker ethic in opposition to the Protestant work ethic. In Himanen&#x27;s opinion, the hacker ethic is more closely related to the virtue ethics found in the writings of Plato and of Aristotle. Himanen explained these ideas in a book, &quot;The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of the Information Age&quot;, with a prologue contributed by Linus Torvalds and an epilogue by Manuel Castells.

In this manifesto, the authors wrote about a hacker ethic centering on passion, hard work, creativity and joy in creating software. Both Himanen and Torvalds were inspired by the Sampo in Finnish mythology. The Sampo, described in the Kalevala saga, was a magical artifact constructed by Ilmarinen, the blacksmith god, that brought good fortune to its holder; nobody knows exactly what it was supposed to be. The Sampo has been interpreted in many ways: a world pillar or world tree, a compass or astrolabe, a chest containing a treasure, a Byzantine coin die, a decorated Vendel period shield, a Christian relic, etc. Kalevala saga compiler Lönnrot interpreted it to be a &quot;quern&quot; or mill of some sort that made flour, salt, and wealth.

<text>A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. Facilities provided inside a hotel room may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator, and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a television, and en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, a business center with computers, printers, and other office equipment, childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa, and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&amp;Bs) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In Japan, capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.

The precursor to the modern hotel was the inn of medieval Europe. For a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century, coaching inns served as a place for lodging for coach travelers. Inns began to cater to wealthier clients in the mid-18th century. One of the first hotels in a modern sense was opened in Exeter in 1768. Hotels proliferated throughout Western Europe and North America in the early 19th century, and luxury hotels began to spring up in the later part of the 19th century, particularly in the United States.

Hotel operations vary in size, function, complexity, and cost. Most hotels and major hospitality companies have set industry standards to classify hotel types. An upscale full-service hotel facility offers luxury amenities, full-service accommodations, an on-site restaurant, and the highest level of personalized service, such as a concierge, room service, and clothes-ironing staff. Full-service hotels often contain upscale full-service facilities with many full-service accommodations, an on-site full-service restaurant, and a variety of on-site amenities. Boutique hotels are smaller independent, non-branded hotels that often contain upscale facilities. Small to medium-sized hotel establishments offer a limited amount of on-site amenities. Economy hotels are small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer basic accommodations with little to no services. Extended stay hotels are small to medium-sized hotels that offer longer-term full-service accommodations compared to a traditional hotel.

Timeshare and destination clubs are a form of property ownership involving ownership of an individual unit of accommodation for seasonal usage. A motel is a small-sized low-rise lodging with direct access to individual rooms from the car parking area. Boutique hotels are typically hotels with a unique environment or intimate setting. A number of hotels and motels have entered the public consciousness through popular culture. Some hotels are built specifically as destinations in themselves, for example casinos and holiday resorts.

Most hotel establishments are run by a general manager who serves as the head executive (often referred to as the &quot;hotel manager&quot;), overseeing the entire operation and ensuring all departments function cohesively, department heads who oversee various departments within a hotel (e.g., food service), middle managers, administrative staff, and line-level supervisors. Each department head manages their specific area, trains staff, handles departmental budgets, and ensures their team delivers quality service that aligns with the hotel’s standards. The organizational chart and volume of job positions and hierarchy varies by hotel size, function and class, and is often determined by hotel ownership and managing companies.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;hotel&quot; is derived from the French &quot;hôtel&quot; (coming from the same origin as &quot;hospital&quot;), which referred to a French version of a building seeing frequent visitors, and providing care, rather than a place offering accommodation. In contemporary French usage, &quot;hôtel&quot; now has the same meaning as the English term, and &quot;hôtel particulier&quot; is used for the old meaning, as well as &quot;hôtel&quot; in some place names such as Hôtel-Dieu (in Paris), which has been a hospital since the Middle Ages. The French spelling, with the circumflex, was also used in English, but is now rare. The circumflex replaces the &#x27;s&#x27; found in the earlier &quot;hostel&quot; spelling, which over time took on a new, but closely related meaning. Grammatically, hotels usually take the definite article – hence &quot;The Astoria Hotel&quot; or simply &quot;The Astoria&quot;.

==History==

Facilities offering hospitality to travellers featured in early civilizations. In Greco-Roman culture and in ancient Persia, hospitals for recuperation and rest were built at thermal baths. Guinness World Records officially recognised Japan&#x27;s Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan, founded in 705, as the oldest hotel in the world. During the Middle Ages, various religious orders at monasteries and abbeys would offer accommodation for travellers on the road.

The precursor to the modern hotel was the inn of medieval Europe, possibly dating back to the rule of Ancient Rome. These would provide for the needs of travellers, including food and lodging, stabling and fodder for the traveller&#x27;s horses and fresh horses for mail coaches. Famous London examples of inns include the George and the Tabard. A typical layout of an inn featured an inner court with bedrooms on the two sides, with the kitchen and parlour at the front and the stables at the back.

For a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century, coaching inns served as a place for lodging for coach travellers (in other words, a roadhouse). Coaching inns stabled teams of horses for stagecoaches and mail coaches and replaced tired teams with fresh teams. Traditionally they were seven miles apart, but this depended very much on the terrain.


Some English towns had as many as ten such inns and rivalry between them became intense, not only for the income from the stagecoach operators but for the revenue from the food and drink supplied to the wealthy passengers. By the end of the century, coaching inns were being run more professionally, with a regular timetable being followed and fixed menus for food.

Inns began to cater to richer clients in the mid-18th century, and consequently grew in grandeur and in the level of service provided. Sudhir Andrews traces &quot;the birth of an organised hotel industry&quot; to Europe&#x27;s chalets and small hotels which catered primarily to aristocrats.
One of the first hotels in a modern sense, the Royal Clarence, opened in Exeter in 1768, although the idea only really caught on in the early-19th century. In 1812 Mivart&#x27;s Hotel opened its doors in London, later changing its name to Claridge&#x27;s.

Hotels proliferated throughout Western Europe and North America in the 19th century. Luxury hotels, including the 1829 Tremont House in Boston, the 1836 Astor House in New York City, the 1889 Savoy Hotel in London, and the Ritz chain of hotels in London and Paris in the late 1890s, catered to an ever more-wealthy clientele.

Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is part of a United States law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or national origin in places of public accommodation. Hotels are included as types of public accommodation in the Act.

==International scale==
Hotels cater to travelers from many countries and languages, since no one country dominates the travel industry.

==Types==
Hotel operations vary in size, function, and cost. Most hotels and major hospitality companies that operate hotels have set widely accepted industry standards to classify hotel types. General categories include the following:

===International luxury===
International luxury hotels offer high-quality amenities, full-service accommodations, on-site full-service restaurants, and the highest level of personalized and professional service in major or capital cities. International luxury hotels are classified with at least a Five Diamond rating or Five Star hotel rating depending on the country and local classification standards. Example brands include: Grand Hyatt, Conrad, InterContinental, Sofitel, Mandarin Oriental, Four Seasons, The Peninsula, Rosewood, JW Marriott and The Ritz-Carlton.

===Lifestyle luxury resorts===

Lifestyle luxury resorts are branded hotels that appeal to a guest with lifestyle or personal image in specific locations. They are typically full-service and classified as luxury. A key characteristic of lifestyle resorts is focus on providing a unique guest experience as opposed to simply providing lodging. Lifestyle luxury resorts are classified with a Five Star hotel rating depending on the country and local classification standards. Example brands include: Waldorf Astoria, St. Regis, Wynn Resorts, MGM, Shangri-La, Oberoi, Belmond, Jumeirah, Aman, Taj Hotels, Hoshino, Raffles, Fairmont, Banyan Tree, Regent and Park Hyatt.

===Upscale full-service===
Upscale full-service hotels often provide a wide array of guest services and on-site facilities. Commonly found amenities may include: on-site food and beverage (room service and restaurants), meeting and conference services and facilities, fitness center, and business center. Upscale full-service hotels range in quality from upscale to luxury. This classification is based upon the quality of facilities and amenities offered by the hotel. Examples include: W Hotels, Sheraton, Langham, Kempinski, Pullman,
Kimpton Hotels, Hilton, Swissôtel, Lotte, Renaissance, Marriott and Hyatt Regency brands.

===Boutique===
Boutique hotels are smaller independent non-branded hotels that often contain mid-scale to upscale facilities of varying size in unique or intimate settings with full-service accommodations. These hotels are generally 100 rooms or fewer.

===Focused or select service===
Small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer a limited number of on-site amenities that only cater and market to a specific demographic of travelers, such as the single business traveler. Most focused or select service hotels may still offer full-service accommodations but may lack leisure amenities such as an on-site restaurant or a swimming pool. Examples include Hyatt Place, Holiday Inn, Courtyard by Marriott and Hilton Garden Inn.

===Economy and limited service===
Small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer a very limited number of on-site amenities and often only offer basic accommodations with little to no services, catering to the budget-minded traveler seeking a &quot;no frills&quot; accommodation. Limited service hotels often lack an on-site restaurant but in return may offer a limited complimentary food and beverage amenity such as on-site continental breakfast service. Examples include Ibis Budget, Hampton Inn, Aloft, Holiday Inn Express, Fairfield Inn, and Four Points by Sheraton.

===Extended stay===
Extended stay hotels are small to medium-sized hotels that offer longer-term full-service accommodations compared to a traditional hotel. Extended stay hotels may offer non-traditional pricing methods such as a weekly rate that caters towards travelers in need of short-term accommodations for an extended period of time. Similar to limited and select service hotels, on-site amenities are normally limited and most extended stay hotels lack an on-site restaurant. Examples include Staybridge Suites, Candlewood Suites, Homewood Suites by Hilton, Home2 Suites by Hilton, Residence Inn by Marriott, Element, and Extended Stay America.

===Timeshare and destination clubs===
Timeshare and destination clubs are a form of property ownership also referred to as a vacation ownership involving the purchase and ownership of an individual unit of accommodation for seasonal usage during a specified period of time. Timeshare resorts often offer amenities similar that of a full-service hotel with on-site restaurants, swimming pools, recreation grounds, and other leisure-oriented amenities. Destination clubs on the other hand may offer more exclusive private accommodations such as private houses in a neighborhood-style setting. Examples of timeshare brands include Hilton Grand Vacations, Marriott Vacation Club International, Westgate Resorts, Disney Vacation Club, and Holiday Inn Club Vacations.

===Motel===
A motel, an abbreviation for &quot;motor hotel&quot;, is a small-sized low-rise lodging establishment similar to a limited service, lower-cost hotel, but typically with direct access to individual rooms from the car park. Motels were built to serve road travellers, including travellers on road trip vacations and workers who drive for their job (travelling salespeople, truck drivers, etc.). Common during the 1950s and 1960s, motels were often located adjacent to a major highway, where they were built on inexpensive land at the edge of towns or along stretches of freeway.

New motel construction is rare in the 2000s as hotel chains have been building economy-priced, limited-service franchised properties at freeway exits which compete for largely the same clientele, largely saturating the market by the 1990s. Motels are still useful in less populated areas for driving travelers, but the more populated an area becomes, the more hotels move in to meet the demand for accommodation. While many motels are unbranded and independent, many of the other motels which remain in operation joined national franchise chains, often rebranding themselves as hotels, inns or lodges. Some examples of chains with motels include EconoLodge, Motel 6, Super 8, and Travelodge.

Motels in some parts of the world are more often regarded as places for romantic assignations where rooms are often rented by the hour. This is fairly common in parts of Latin America.

In the United States, motels have a reputation for criminal activity such as prostitution and drug dealing.

===Microstay===
Hotels may offer rooms for microstays, a type of booking for less than 24 hours where the customer chooses the check in time and the length of the stay. This allows the hotel increased revenue by reselling the same room several times a day. They first gained popularity in Europe but are now common in major global tourist centers.

== Management ==

Hotel management is a globally accepted professional career field and academic field of study. Degree programs such as hospitality management studies, a business degree, and/or certification programs formally prepare hotel managers for industry practice.

Most hotel establishments consist of a general manager who serves as the head executive (often referred to as the &quot;hotel manager&quot;), department heads who oversee various departments within a hotel, middle managers, administrative staff, and line-level supervisors. The organizational chart and volume of job positions and hierarchy varies by hotel size, function, and is often determined by hotel ownership and managing companies.

==Unique and specialty hotels==

=== Historic inns and boutique hotels ===
Boutique hotels are typically hotels with a unique environment or intimate setting.
Some hotels have gained their renown through tradition, by hosting significant events or persons, such as Schloss Cecilienhof in Potsdam, Germany, which derives its fame from the Potsdam Conference of the World War II allies Winston Churchill, Harry Truman and Joseph Stalin in 1945. The Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower in Mumbai is one of India&#x27;s most famous and historic hotels because of its association with the Indian independence movement. Some establishments have given name to a particular meal or beverage, as is the case with the Waldorf Astoria in New York City, United States where the Waldorf Salad was first created or the Hotel Sacher in Vienna, Austria, home of the Sachertorte. Others have achieved fame by association with dishes or cocktails created on their premises, such as the Hotel de Paris where the crêpe Suzette was invented or the Raffles Hotel in Singapore, where the Singapore Sling cocktail was devised.

A number of hotels have entered the public consciousness through popular culture, such as the Ritz Hotel in London, through its association with Irving Berlin&#x27;s song, &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Ritz&quot;. The Algonquin Hotel in New York City is famed as the meeting place of the literary group, the Algonquin Round Table, and Hotel Chelsea, also in New York City, has been the subject of a number of songs and the scene of the stabbing of Nancy Spungen (allegedly by her boyfriend Sid Vicious).

===Resort hotels===
Some hotels are built specifically as a destination in itself to create a captive trade, example at casinos, amusement parks and holiday resorts. Though hotels have always been built in popular destinations, the defining characteristic of a resort hotel is that it exists purely to serve another attraction, the two having the same owners.

On the Las Vegas Strip there is a tradition of one-upmanship with luxurious and extravagant hotels in a concentrated area. This trend now has extended to other resorts worldwide, but the concentration in Las Vegas is still the world&#x27;s highest: nineteen of the world&#x27;s twenty-five largest hotels by room count are on the Strip, with a total of over 67,000 rooms.

===Bunker hotels===
The Null Stern Hotel in Teufen, Appenzellerland, Switzerland, and the Concrete Mushrooms in Albania are former nuclear bunkers transformed into hotels.

===Cave hotels===
The Cuevas Pedro Antonio de Alarcón (named after the author) in Guadix, Spain, as well as several hotels in Cappadocia, Turkey, are notable for being built into natural cave formations, some with rooms underground. The Desert Cave Hotel in Coober Pedy, South Australia, is built into the remains of an opal mine.

===Cliff hotels===

Located on the coast but high above sea level, these hotels offer unobstructed panoramic views and a great sense of privacy without the feeling of total isolation. Some examples from around the globe are the Riosol Hotel in Gran Canaria, Caruso Belvedere Hotel in Amalfi Coast (Italy), Aman Resorts Amankila in Bali, Birkenhead House in Hermanus (South Africa), The Caves in Jamaica and Caesar Augustus in Capri.

===Capsule hotels===

Capsule hotels are a type of economical hotel first introduced in Japan, where people sleep in stacks of rectangular containers. In the sleeping capsules, beside the bed, the customer can watch TV, put their valuables in the mini safes, and the customers also can use the wireless internet.

===Day room hotels===
Some hotels fill daytime occupancy with day rooms, for example, Rodeway Inn and Suites near Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Day rooms are booked in a block of hours typically between 8 am and 5 pm, before the typical night shift. These are similar to transit hotels in that they appeal to travelers, however, unlike transit hotels, they do not eliminate the need to go through Customs.

===Garden hotels===
Garden hotels, famous for their gardens before they became hotels, include Gravetye Manor, the home of garden designer William Robinson, and Cliveden, designed by Charles Barry with a rose garden by Geoffrey Jellicoe.

===Ice, snow and igloo hotels===
The Ice Hotel in Jukkasjärvi, Sweden, was the first ice hotel in the world; first built in 1990, it is built each winter and melts every spring. The Hotel de Glace in Duschenay, Canada, opened in 2001 and it is North America&#x27;s only ice hotel. It is redesigned and rebuilt in its entirety every year. 
Ice hotels can also be included within larger ice complexes; for example, the Mammut Snow Hotel in Finland is located within the walls of the Kemi snow castle; and the Lainio Snow Hotel is part of a snow village near Ylläs, Finland. There is an arctic snowhotel in Rovaniemi in Lapland, Finland, along with glass igloos. The first glass igloos were built in 1999 in Finland, they became the Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort with 65 buildings, 53 small ones for two people and 12 large ones for four people. Glass igloos, with their roof made of thermal glass, allow guests to admire auroras comfortably from their beds.

===Love hotels===

A love hotel (also &#x27;love motel&#x27;, especially in Taiwan) is a type of short-stay hotel found around the world, operated primarily for the purpose of allowing guests privacy for sexual activities, typically for one to three hours, but with overnight as an option. Styles of premises vary from extremely low-end to extravagantly appointed. In Japan, love hotels have a history of over 400 years.

===Portable modular hotels===
In 2021 a New York-based company introduced new modular and movable hotel rooms which allow landowners and hospitality groups to create and easily scale hotel accommodations. The portable units can be built in three to five months and can be stacked to create multi-floor units.

===Referral hotel===

A referral hotel is a hotel chain that offers branding to independently operated hotels; the chain itself is founded by or owned by the member hotels as a group. Many former referral chains have been converted to franchises; the largest surviving member-owned chain is Best Western.

===Railway hotels===

The first recorded purpose-built railway hotel was the Great Western Hotel, which opened adjacent to Reading railway station in 1844, shortly after the Great Western Railway opened its line from London. The building still exists, and although it has been used for other purposes over the years, it is now again a hotel and a member of the Malmaison hotel chain.

Frequently, expanding railway companies built grand hotels at their termini, such as the Midland Hotel, Manchester next to the former Manchester Central Station, and in London the ones above St Pancras railway station and Charing Cross railway station. London also has the Chiltern Court Hotel above Baker Street tube station, there are also Canada&#x27;s grand railway hotels. They are or were mostly, but not exclusively, used by those traveling by rail.

=== Straw bale hotels ===
The Maya Guesthouse in Nax Mont-Noble in the Swiss Alps, is the first hotel in Europe built entirely with straw bales. Due to the insulation values of the walls it needs no conventional heating or air conditioning system, although the Maya Guesthouse is built at an altitude of in the Alps.

===Transit hotels===

Transit hotels are short stay hotels typically used at international airports where passengers can stay while waiting to change airplanes. The hotels are typically on the airside and do not require a visa for a stay or re-admission through security checkpoints.

===Treehouse hotels===
Some hotels are built with living trees as structural elements, for example the Treehotel near Piteå, Sweden, the Costa Rica Tree House near the Jairo Mora Sandoval Gandoca-Manzanillo Mixed Wildlife Refuge, Costa Rica; the Treetops Hotel in Aberdare National Park, Kenya; the Ariau Towers near Manaus, Brazil, on the Rio Negro in the Amazon; and Bayram&#x27;s Tree Houses in Olympos, Turkey.

===Underwater hotels===

Some hotels have accommodation underwater, such as Utter Inn in Lake Mälaren, Sweden. Hydropolis, project in Dubai, would have had suites on the bottom of the Persian Gulf, and Jules&#x27; Undersea Lodge in Key Largo, Florida, requires scuba diving to access its rooms.

===Overwater hotels===

A resort island is an island or an archipelago that contains resorts, hotels, overwater bungalows, restaurants, tourist attractions and its amenities. Maldives has the most overwater bungalows resorts.

===Yurt hotels===
Yurts are circular, self-supporting structures with long rafters coalescing toward a central dome. During the day, the dome allows sunlight to illuminate the entire yurt interior, while moonlight and starlight shine through the dome at night.

===Other specialty hotels===

<doc id="14279" wikidata="Q194280" url="?curid=14279" title="Hugh Hefner">
<text>Hugh Marston Hefner (April 9, 1926 – September 27, 2017) was an American magazine publisher. He was the founder and editor-in-chief of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, a publication with revealing photographs and articles. Hefner extended the &quot;Playboy&quot; brand into a world network of Playboy Clubs. He also resided in luxury mansions where &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmates shared his wild partying life, fueling media interest.

==Early life and education==
Hefner was born in Chicago, on April 9, 1926, the first child of Glenn Lucius Hefner (1896–1976), an accountant, and his wife Grace Caroline (Swanson) Hefner (1895–1997) who worked as a teacher. His parents were from Nebraska. He had a younger brother, Keith (1929–2016). His mother was of Swedish ancestry, and his father was German and English.

Through his father&#x27;s line, Hefner was a descendant of Plymouth governor William Bradford. He described his family as &quot;conservative, Midwestern, [and] Methodist&quot;. His mother had wanted him to become a missionary.

He attended Sayre Elementary School and Steinmetz High School, then served from 1944 to 1946 as a United States Army writer for a military newspaper. Hefner graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1949 with a Bachelor of Arts in psychology and a double minor in creative writing and art, having earned his degree in two and a half years. In the spring of 1950, he took a semester of graduate courses in sociology at Northwestern University, but dropped out soon after.

==Career==
In January 1952, Hefner left his job as a copywriter for &quot;Esquire&quot; after he was denied a $5 raise. In 1953, he took out a mortgage loan of $600 and raised $8,000 from 45 investors (including $1,000 from his mother—&quot;not because she believed in the venture,&quot; he told &quot;E!&quot; in 2006, &quot;but because she believed in her son&quot;) to launch &quot;Playboy&quot;, which was initially going to be called &quot;Stag Party&quot;. The first issue was published in December 1953 and featured Marilyn Monroe from a 1949 nude calendar shoot she did under a pseudonym. That first issue sold more than 50,000 copies, but Monroe was not paid by Playboy or Hefner for the photos. (Hefner never met Monroe, but he bought the crypt next to hers at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in 1992 for $75,000.)

&quot;Esquire&quot; magazine rejected Charles Beaumont&#x27;s science fiction story &quot;The Crooked Man&quot; in 1955, so Hefner agreed to publish it in &quot;Playboy.&quot; The story highlighted straight men being persecuted in a world where homosexuality was the norm. The magazine received angry letters, so Hefner responded, &quot;If it was wrong to persecute heterosexuals in a homosexual society then the reverse was wrong, too.&quot; In 1961, Hefner watched Dick Gregory perform at the Herman Roberts Show Bar in Chicago, and he hired Gregory to work at the Chicago Playboy Club. Gregory attributed the launch of his career to that night.

Hefner promoted a &quot;bon vivant&quot; lifestyle in his magazine and in the television shows that he hosted, &quot;Playboy&#x27;s Penthouse&quot; (1959–1960) and &quot;Playboy After Dark&quot; (1969–1970). He was also the chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises, the publishing group which operates the magazine.

On June 4, 1963, Hefner was arrested for promoting obscene literature after he published an issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; featuring nude shots of Jayne Mansfield in bed with a man present. The case went to trial and resulted in a hung jury.

In the 1960s, Hefner created &quot;private key&quot; clubs that were racially diverse. During the civil rights movement in 1966, Hefner sent Alex Haley to interview American Nazi Party founder George Lincoln Rockwell, much to Rockwell&#x27;s shock because Haley was black. Rockwell agreed to meet with Haley only after gaining assurance that he was not Jewish, although Rockwell kept a handgun on the table throughout the interview. In &quot;&quot; (1979), the interview was recreated with James Earl Jones as Haley and Marlon Brando as Rockwell. Haley had also interviewed Malcolm X in 1963 and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1966 for the newly established 1962 &quot;playboy interview&quot;.
In 1970, Hefner stated that &quot;militant feminists&quot; are &quot;unalterably opposed to the romantic boy-girl society that &quot;Playboy&quot; promotes&quot; and ordered an article in his magazine against them.

In his later years, Hefner&#x27;s star dimmed, but he remained a well-known personality, often appearing in cameo roles. In the 1993 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot;, Hefner voiced himself. In 1999, Hefner financed the Clara Bow documentary &quot;Discovering the It Girl&quot;. &quot;Nobody has what Clara had,&quot; he said. &quot;She defined an era and made her mark on the nation&quot;. Hefner guest-starred as himself in the 2000 &quot;Sex and the City&quot; episode &quot;Sex and Another City&quot;. In 2005, he guest-starred on the HBO shows &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; and &quot;Entourage&quot;. He guest-starred as himself in a 2006 episode of Seth Green&#x27;s &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; on the late-night programming block Adult Swim. In the 2007 &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Airport &#x27;07&quot;, he voiced himself. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for television and made several movie appearances as himself. In 2009, he was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor for his performance as himself in &quot;Miss March&quot;. On his official Twitter account, he joked about this nomination: &quot;Maybe I didn&#x27;t understand the character.&quot;

Brigitte Berman&#x27;s documentary &quot;Hugh Hefner: Playboy, Activist and Rebel&quot; was released on July 30, 2010. He had previously granted full access to documentary filmmaker and television producer Kevin Burns for the A&amp;E &quot;Biography&quot; special &quot;Hugh Hefner: American Playboy&quot; in 1996. Hefner and Burns later collaborated on numerous other television projects, most notably on &quot;The Girls Next Door&quot;, a reality series that ran for six seasons (2005–2009) and 90 episodes. Hefner also made a voice-only appearance as himself in the 2011 film &quot;Hop&quot;.

In 2012, Hefner announced that his youngest son Cooper would succeed him as the public face of &quot;Playboy&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hefner was known to friends and family simply as &quot;Hef&quot;. He married Northwestern University student Mildred (&quot;Millie&quot;) Williams in 1949. They had a daughter named Christie (b. 1952) and a son, David (b. 1955). Before the wedding, Mildred confessed that she had an affair while he was away in the army. He called the admission &quot;the most devastating moment of my life.&quot; A 2006 &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; profile of Hefner revealed that Mildred allowed him to have sex with other women, out of guilt for her own infidelity and in the hope that it would preserve their marriage. The couple divorced in 1959.

Hefner remade himself as a &quot;bon vivant&quot; and man about town, a lifestyle that he promoted in his magazine and TV shows. He admitted to being &quot;&#x27;involved&#x27; with maybe eleven out of twelve months&#x27; worth of Playmates&quot; during some years. Donna Michelle, Marilyn Cole, Lillian Müller, Shannon Tweed, Barbi Benton, Karen Christy, Sondra Theodore, and Carrie Leigh were a few of his many lovers; Leigh filed a $35 million palimony suit against him. In 1971, he acknowledged that he experimented in bisexuality. Also in 1971, he established a second residence in Los Angeles with the acquisition of Playboy Mansion West, and moved there permanently from Chicago in 1975.

On March 7, 1985, Hefner had a minor stroke at age 58, whereupon he re-evaluated his lifestyle, making several changes. He toned down the wild, all-night parties, and his daughter Christie took over the operation of Playboy&#x27;s commercial operations in 1988. The following year, he married Playmate of the Year Kimberley Conrad; they were 36 years apart in age. The couple had sons Marston Glenn (b. 1990) and Cooper (b. 1991). The &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; profile noted that the Playboy Mansion had been transformed into a family-friendly homestead. He and Conrad separated in 1998, after which she moved into the house next door to the mansion. Hefner filed for divorce from Conrad in 2009 after an 11-year separation, citing irreconcilable differences. He stated that he only remained nominally married to her for the sake of their children, and their youngest child had just turned 18. The divorce was finalized in 2010.

Hefner became known for moving an ever-changing coterie of young women into the Playboy Mansion, including twins Mandy and Sandy Bentley. He dated as many as seven women concurrently. He also dated Brande Roderick, Izabella St. James, Tina Marie Jordan, Holly Madison, Bridget Marquardt, and Kendra Wilkinson. Madison, Wilkinson, and Marquardt appeared on &quot;The Girls Next Door&quot; depicting their lives at the Playboy Mansion. In October 2008, all three of them decided to leave the mansion.

In January 2009, Hefner began a relationship with Crystal Harris; she joined the Shannon Twins after his previous &quot;number one girlfriend&quot; Holly Madison had ended their seven-year relationship. On December 24, 2010, he became engaged to Harris, but she broke off their engagement on June 14, 2011, five days before their planned wedding. The July issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; reached store shelves and customers&#x27; homes within days of the wedding date; it featured Harris on the cover, and in a photo spread as well. The headline on the cover read &quot;Introducing America&#x27;s Princess, Mrs. Crystal Hefner&quot;. Hefner and Harris subsequently reconciled and married on December 31, 2012.

Hefner was very distantly related to the 41st and 43rd presidents of the United States, George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, respectively. Hefner&#x27;s brother Keith died at age 87 on April 8, 2016, one day before Hefner&#x27;s 90th birthday.

==Playboy Mansion==
In January 2016, the Playboy Mansion was put on the market for $200 million, on condition that Hugh Hefner would continue to work and live in the mansion. Later that year it was sold to Daren Metropoulos, a principal at private equity firm Metropoulos &amp; Company, for $100 million. Metropoulos planned to reconnect the Playboy Mansion property with a neighboring estate that he purchased in 2009, combining the two for a 7.3-acre (3-hectare) compound as his own private residence.

In May 2017, Eugena Washington was the last Playmate of the Year to be announced by Hugh Hefner at the Playboy Mansion.

==Politics and philanthropy==

In 1964, Hefner established the Hugh M. Hefner Foundation to &quot;facilitate individual rights in our democratic society&quot;. The foundation funded Marty Goddard&#x27;s prototype of the rape kit as part of its efforts to support women&#x27;s empowerment. Additionally, the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award was created by Christie Hefner &quot;to honor individuals who have made significant contributions in the vital effort to protect and enhance First Amendment rights for Americans.&quot;

Hefner debated &quot;The Playboy Philosophy&quot; with William F. Buckley Jr., on &quot;Firing Line&quot; in Episode 26, recorded on September 12, 1966.

Hefner donated and raised money for the Democratic Party. In 2011, he referred to himself as an independent due to dissatisfaction with both the Democratic and Republican parties. Nonetheless, in 2012, he supported Barack Obama&#x27;s reelection campaign.

In 1978, Hefner helped organize fund-raising efforts that led to the restoration of the Hollywood Sign. He hosted a gala fundraiser at the Playboy Mansion and contributed $27,000 (or 1/9 of the total restoration costs) by purchasing the letter Y in a ceremonial auction.

Hefner stated in a 2000 interview with &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s perfectly clear to me that religion is a myth. It&#x27;s something we have invented to explain the inexplicable.&quot; Lee Strobel, a Christian author who interviewed Hefner regarding his theological positions, later described Hefner as having a &quot;very minimalistic, deistic view of God.&quot;

Hefner donated $100,000 to the University of Southern California&#x27;s School of Cinematic Arts to create a course called &quot;Censorship in Cinema&quot;, and $2 million to endow a chair for the study of American film. In 2007, the university&#x27;s audiovisual archive at the Norris Theater received a donation from Hefner and was renamed to the Hugh M. Hefner Moving Image Archive in his honor.

Both through his charitable foundation and individually, Hefner also contributed to charities and other organizations outside the sphere of politics and publishing, throwing fundraiser events for Much Love Animal Rescue as well as Generation Rescue, an anti-vaccinationist campaign organization supported by Jenny McCarthy.

On April 26, 2010, Hefner donated the last $900,000 sought by a conservation group for a land purchase needed to stop the development of the vista of the Hollywood Sign. &quot;Sylvilagus palustris hefneri&quot;, an endangered subspecies of marsh rabbit, is named after him in honor of financial support that he provided.

On November 18, 2010, Children of the Night founder and president Lois Lee presented Hefner with the organization&#x27;s first-ever Founder&#x27;s Hero of the Heart Award in appreciation for his unwavering dedication, commitment and generosity.

The Barbi Twins, who are among a notable cohort of celebrity Playmates, including Pamela Anderson and Hefner&#x27;s third wife Crystal Harris, praised the publishing icon for providing centerfolds and extended members of the Playboy family with a platform for activism and advocacy on behalf of animal populations in need.

Hefner supported legalizing same-sex marriage, calling it &quot;a fight for all our rights. Without it, we will turn back the sexual revolution and return to an earlier, puritanical time.&quot;

==Death==
Hefner died at the Playboy Mansion on September 27, 2017, at the age of 91. The cause was sepsis brought on by an &quot;E. coli&quot; infection.

He is interred at Westwood Memorial Park in Los Angeles, in the crypt beside Marilyn Monroe, for which he paid $75,000 in 1992. &quot;Spending eternity next to Marilyn is an opportunity too sweet to pass up,&quot; Hefner had told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2009.

==Reputation==
Suzanne Moore wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that Hefner threatened to file a lawsuit against her for calling him a &quot;pimp&quot;. Defending her position, Moore argued that &quot;he was a man who bought and sold women to other men&quot;. She further stated that &quot;part of Hefner&#x27;s business acumen was to make the selling of female flesh respectable and hip, to make soft porn acceptable.&quot; Julie Bindel argued in &quot;The Independent&quot; that Hefner &quot;caused immeasurable damage by turning porn—and therefore the buying and selling of women&#x27;s bodies—into a legitimate business.&quot;

Robin Abcarian wrote in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, quoting Wendy Hamilton, that Hefner &quot;probably did more to mainstream the exploitation of women&#x27;s bodies than any other figure in American history,&quot; adding that he &quot;managed to convince many women that taking off their clothes for men&#x27;s pleasure was not just empowering, but a worthy goal in itself.&quot; She further stated that Hefner &quot;embodied the aesthetic notion that images of women—and women themselves—exist to please men.&quot;

Hefner&#x27;s former girlfriend Holly Madison said that he &quot;would encourage competition—and body image issues—between his multiple live-in girlfriends. His legacy is full of evidence of the exploitation of women for professional gain.&quot; Ed Stetzer wrote in &quot;Christianity Today&quot; that Hefner would have the residence systematically cleaned whenever Christie Hefner visited in order &quot;to keep the realities from his own daughter&quot;. Stetzer further lamented the consequences of Hefner&#x27;s role as a &quot;general&quot; of the &quot;sexual revolution&quot;:

A 12-part television documentary series, &quot;Secrets of Playboy&quot;, debuted on A&amp;E January 24, 2022, in which Hefner&#x27;s former male and female employees and partners made claims of systematic sexual misconduct and manipulation, recreational and manipulative drug use, peer pressure, sextortion, blackmail, rape, forced and violent anal sex, sexual assault without consent and/or while victims were in a state of drug-induced stupor or unconsciousness, spying, videotaping without consent, and illegal sex with minors by Hefner and his celebrity friends and guests at the Playboy Mansion and other locations. The PLBY group, now publicly owned, distanced itself from Hefner in a statement released shortly before the first episode was broadcast, saying, &quot;Today&#x27;s Playboy is not Hugh Hefner&#x27;s Playboy. We trust and validate these women and their stories and we strongly support those individuals who have come forward to share their experiences.&quot;

In January 2024, Hefner&#x27;s widow Crystal, who previously brushed away criticism, wrote a memoir where she alleged she experienced a hostile environment while at the Playboy Mansion, even claiming that she was &quot;imprisoned&quot; while there.

==Depictions==
The Amazon original series &quot;American Playboy: The Hugh Hefner Story&quot; was released in April 2017. It stars Matt Whelan in the title role, along with Emmett Skilton and Chelsie Preston Crayford. The ten episodes are a combination of interviews, archival footage (including moments found in Hefner&#x27;s vast personal collection), and cinematic re-enactments that cover the launch of the magazine as well as the next six decades of Hefner&#x27;s personal life and career. The series was filmed in Auckland.

In October 2017, Playboy Enterprises announced that a Hugh Hefner biopic directed by Brett Ratner with the screenplay by Jeff Nathanson was greenlit with Jared Leto rumored to play Hefner. In November 2017, it was indefinitely put on hold following sexual harassment allegations against Ratner, and Leto&#x27;s representatives stated that reports of him being attached to the film at any point were false.

<text>Hafizullah Amin (; 1 August 192927 December 1979) was an Afghan communist head of state, who served in that position for a little over three months, from September 1979 until his assassination. He organized the Saur Revolution of 1978 and co-founded the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA), ruling Afghanistan as General Secretary of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party.

Born in the town of Paghman in Kabul Province, Amin studied at Kabul University and started his career as a teacher before he twice went to the United States to study. During this time, Amin became attracted to Marxism and became involved in radical student movements at the University of Wisconsin. Upon his return to Afghanistan, he used his teaching position to spread socialist ideologies to students, and he later joined the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), a new far-left organization co-founded by Nur Muhammad Taraki and Babrak Karmal. He ran as a candidate in the 1965 parliamentary election but failed to secure a seat, but in 1969 became the only Khalqist elected to parliament, increasing his standing within the party.

Amin was the main organizer of the April 1978 Saur Revolution, which overthrew the government of Mohammad Daoud Khan and formed a pro-Soviet state based on socialist ideals. Being second in chief of the Democratic Republic, Amin soon became the regime&#x27;s strongman, the main architect of the state&#x27;s programs including mass persecution of those deemed counter-revolutionary. A growing personal struggle with General Secretary Taraki eventually led to Amin wrestling power away then successfully deposing him and later ordering his execution; on 16 September 1979, Amin named himself Chairman of the Council of Ministers (head of government), Chairman of the Revolutionary Council (head of state), and General Secretary of the PDPA Central Committee (supreme leader).

Amin&#x27;s short-lived leadership featured controversies from beginning to end. His government failed to solve the problem of the population revolting against the regime as the situation rapidly worsened and army desertions and defections continued. He tried to change things with friendly overtures to the United States, however his reputation in Washington was tarnished by his role in the assassination of Adolph Dubs. Some Afghans, especially those from minority ethnic groups such as the Hazaras, held Amin responsible for the regime&#x27;s harshest measures, such as ordering thousands of executions, more than 7,000 of which were from the Hazara minority. Thousands of people disappeared without trace during his time in office. The Soviet Union under Leonid Brezhnev was dissatisfied with and mistrusted Amin; they intervened in Afghanistan, invoking the 1978 Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. Soviet operatives assassinated Amin at the Tajbeg Palace on 27 December 1979 as part of Operation Storm-333, kickstarting the 10-year Soviet–Afghan War; he had ruled for a little more than three months.

==Early life and career==
Hafizullah Amin was born to a Kharoti Ghilzai Pashtun family in the Qazi Khel village in Paghman on 1 August 1929. His father, a civil servant, died in 1937 when he was 8. Thanks to his brother Abdullah, a primary school teacher, Amin was able to attend both primary and secondary school, which in turn allowed him to attend Kabul University (KU). After studying mathematics there, he also graduated from the Darul Mualimeen Teachers College in Kabul, and became a teacher. Amin later became vice-principal of the Darul Mualimeen College, and then principal of the prestigious Avesina High School, and in 1957 left Afghanistan for Columbia University in New York City, where he earned MA in education. It was at Columbia that Amin became attracted to Marxism, and in 1958 he became a member of the university&#x27;s Socialist Progressive Club. When he returned to Afghanistan, Amin became a teacher at Kabul University, and later, for the second time, the principal of Avesina High School. During this period Amin became acquainted with Nur Muhammad Taraki, a communist. Around this time, Amin quit his position as principal of Avesina High School to become principal of the Darul Mualimeen College.

It is alleged that Amin became radicalised during his second stay in the United States in 1962, when he enrolled in a work-study group at the University of Wisconsin. Amin studied in the doctoral programme at the Columbia University Teachers College, but started to neglect his studies in favour of politics; in 1963 he became head of the Afghan students&#x27; association at the college. The association was funded by the Asia Foundation, known to be a CIA pass-through group, or front. When he returned to Afghanistan in the mid-1960s, the route flew to Afghanistan by way of Moscow. There, Amin met the Afghan ambassador to the Soviet Union, his old friend Ali Ahmad Popel, a previous Afghan Minister of Education. During his short stay, Amin became even more radicalised. Some people, Nabi Misdaq for instance, do not believe he travelled through Moscow, but rather West Germany and Lebanon. By the time he had returned to Afghanistan, the Communist People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) had already held its founding congress, which was in 1965. Amin ran as a candidate for the PDPA in the 1965 parliamentary election, and lost by a margin of less than fifty votes.
In 1966, when the PDPA Central Committee was expanded, Amin was elected as a non-voting member, and in the spring of 1967 he gained full membership. Amin&#x27;s standing in the Khalq faction of the PDPA increased when he was the only Khalqist elected to parliament in the 1969 parliamentary election. When the PDPA split along factional lines in 1967, between Khalqists led by Nur and Parchamites led by Babrak Karmal, Amin joined the Khalqists. As a member of parliament, Amin tried to win over support from the Pashtun people in the armed forces. According to a biography about Amin, he used his position as member of parliament to fight against imperialism, feudalism, and Reactionary tendencies, and fought against the &quot;rotten&quot; regime, the monarchy. Amin himself said that he used his membership in parliament to pursue the class struggle against the bourgeoisie. Relations between Khalqists and Parchamites deteriorated during this period. Amin, the only Khalq member of parliament, and Babrak Karmal, the only Parcham member of parliament, did not cooperate with each other. Amin would later, during his short stint in power, mention these events with bitterness. Following the arrest of fellow PDPA members Dastagir Panjsheri and Saleh Mohammad Zeary in 1969, Amin became one of the party&#x27;s leading members, and was still a pre-eminent party member by the time of their release in 1973.

===The Daoud era===
From 1973 until the PDPA unification in 1977, Amin was second only to Taraki in the Khalqist PDPA. When the PDPA ruled Afghanistan, their relationship was referred to as a disciple (Amin) following his mentor (Taraki). This official portrayal of the situation was misleading; their relationship was more work-oriented. Taraki needed Amin&#x27;s &quot;tactical and strategic talents&quot;; Amin&#x27;s motivations are more uncertain, but it is commonly believed that he associated with Taraki to protect his own position. Amin had attracted many enemies during his career, the most notable being Karmal. According to the official version of events, Taraki protected Amin from party members or others who wanted to hurt the PDPA and the country. When Mohammad Daoud Khan ousted the monarchy, and established the Republic of Afghanistan, the Khalqist PDPA offered its support for the new regime if it established a National Front which presumably included the Khalqist PDPA itself. The Parchamite PDPA had already established an alliance with Daoud at the beginning of his regime, and Karmal called for the dissolution of the Khalqist PDPA. Karmal&#x27;s call for dissolution only worsened relations between the Khalqist and Parchamite PDPA. However, Taraki and Amin were lucky; Karmal&#x27;s alliance actually hurt the Parchamites&#x27; standing in Afghan politics. Some communists in the armed forces became disillusioned with the government of Daoud, and turned to the Khalqist PDPA because of its apparent independence. Parchamite association with the Daoud government indirectly led to the Khalqist-led PDPA coup of 1978, popularly referred to as the Saur Revolution. From 1973 until the 1978 coup, Amin was responsible for organising party work in the Afghan armed forces. According to the official version, Amin &quot;met patriotic liaison officers day or night, in the desert or the mountains, in the fields or the forests, enlightening them on the basis of the principles of the working class ideology.&quot; Amin&#x27;s success in recruiting military officers lay in the fact that Daoud &quot;betrayed the left&quot; soon after taking power. When Amin began recruiting military officers for the PDPA, it was not difficult for him to find disgruntled military officers. In the meantime, relations between the Parchamite and Khalqist PDPA deteriorated; in 1973 it was rumoured that Major Zia Mohammadzai, a Parchamite and head of the Republican Guard, planned to assassinate the entire Khalqist leadership. The plan, if true, failed because the Khalqists found out about it.
The assassination attempt proved to be a further blow to relations between the Parchamites and Khalqists. The Parchamites deny that they ever planned to assassinate the Khalqist leadership, but historian Beverley Male argues that Karmal&#x27;s subsequent activities give credence to the Khalqist view of events. Because of the Parchamite assassination attempt, Amin pressed the Khalqist PDPA to seize power in 1976 by ousting Daoud. The majority of the PDPA leadership voted against such a move. The following year, in 1977, the Parchamites and Khalqists officially reconciled, and the PDPA was unified. The Parchamite and Khalqist PDPAs, which had separate general secretaries, politburos, central committees and other organisational structures, were officially unified in the summer of 1977. One reason for unification was that the international communist movement, represented by the Communist Party of India, Iraqi Communist Party and the Communist Party of Australia, called for party unification.

===Saur Revolution===
On 18 April 1978 Mir Akbar Khyber, the chief ideologue of the Parcham faction, was killed; he was commonly believed to have been assassinated by the Daoud government. Khyber&#x27;s assassination initiated a chain of events which led to the PDPA taking power eleven days later, on 27 April. The assassin was never caught, but Anahita Ratebzad, a Parchamite, believed that Amin had ordered the assassination. Khyber&#x27;s funeral evolved into a large anti-government demonstration. Daoud, who did not understand the significance of the events, began a mass arrest of PDPA members seven days after Khyber&#x27;s funeral. Amin, who organised the subsequent revolution against Daoud, was one of the last Central Committee members to be arrested by the authorities. His late arrest can be considered as proof of the regime&#x27;s lack of information; Amin was the leading revolutionary party organiser. The government&#x27;s lack of awareness was proven by the arrest of Taraki – Taraki&#x27;s arrest was the pre-arranged signal for the revolution to commence. When Amin found out that Taraki had been arrested, he ordered the revolution to begin at 9 am on 27 April. Amin, in contrast to Taraki, was not imprisoned, but instead put under house arrest. His son, Abdur Rahman, was still allowed freedom of movement. The revolution was successful, thanks to overwhelming support from the Afghan military; for instance, it was supported by Defence Minister Ghulam Haidar Rasuli, Aslam Watanjar the commander of the ground forces, and the Chief of Staff of the Afghan Air Force, Abdul Qadir.

==PDPA rule==

===Khalq–Parcham break===
After the Saur revolution, Taraki was appointed Chairman of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and retained his post as PDPA general secretary. Taraki initially formed a government which consisted of both Khalqists and Parchamites; Karmal became Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council while Amin became Minister of Foreign Affairs and a Deputy Prime Minister, and Mohammad Aslam Watanjar became a Deputy Prime Minister. The two Parchamites Abdul Qadir and Mohammad Rafi became Minister of National Defence and Minister of Public Works respectively. According to Angel Rasanayagam, the appointment of Amin, Karmal and Watanjar as Deputy Prime Ministers led to the establishment of three cabinets; the Khalqists were answerable to Amin, the Parchamites were answerable to Karmal, and the military officers (who were Parchamites) were answerable to Watanjar. The first conflict between the Khalqists and Parchamites arose when the Khalqists wanted to give PDPA Central Committee membership to the military officers who participated in the Saur Revolution. Amin, who had previously opposed the appointment of military officers to the PDPA leadership, switched sides; he now supported their elevation. The PDPA Politburo voted in favour of giving membership to the military officers; the victors (the Khalqists) portrayed the Parchamites as opportunists, implying that the Parchamites had ridden the revolutionary wave, but not actually participated in the revolution. To make matters worse for the Parchamites, the term Parcham was, according to Taraki, a word synonymous with factionalism.
On 27 June 1978, three months after the revolution, Amin managed to outmaneuver the Parchamites at a Central Committee meeting. The meeting decided that the Khalqists had exclusive rights to formulate and decide policy, a policy which left the Parchamites impotent. Karmal was exiled, but was able to establish a network with the remaining Parchamites in government. A coup to overthrow Amin was planned for September. Its leading members in Afghanistan were Qadir, the defence minister, and Army Chief of Staff General Shahpur Ahmedzai. The coup was planned for 4 September, the day of the festival of Eid, because soldiers and officers would be off duty. The conspiracy failed when the Afghan ambassador to India told the Afghan leadership about the plan. A purge was initiated, and Parchamite ambassadors were recalled; few returned, for example Karmal and Mohammad Najibullah both preferred to stay in their assigned countries.

===Amin–Taraki break===
The Afghan people revolted against the PDPA government when the government introduced several socialist reforms, including land reforms. By early 1979, twenty-five out of Afghanistan&#x27;s twenty-eight provinces were unsafe because of armed resistance against the government. On 29 March 1979, the Herat uprising began; the uprising turned the revolt into an open war between the Afghan government and anti-regime resistance. It was during this period that Amin became Kabul&#x27;s strongman. Shortly after the Herat uprising had been crushed, the Revolutionary Council convened to ratify the new Five-Year Plan, the Afghan–Soviet Friendship Treaty, and to vote on whether or not to reorganise the cabinet and to enhance the power of the executive (the Chairman of the Revolutionary Council). While the official version of events said that all issues were voted on democratically at the meeting, the Revolutionary Council held another meeting the following day to ratify the new Five-Year Plan and to discuss the reorganisation of the cabinet.

Alexander Puzanov, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, was able to persuade Aslam Watanjar, Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy and Sherjan Mazdoryar to become part of a conspiracy against Amin. These three men put pressure on Taraki, who by this time believed that &quot;he really was the &#x27;great leader, to sack Amin from office. It is unknown if Amin knew anything about the conspiracy against him, but it was after the cabinet reorganisation that he talked about his dissatisfaction. On 26 March the PDPA Politburo and the Council of Ministers approved the extension of the powers of the executive branch, and the establishment of the Homeland Higher Defence Council (HHDC) to handle security matters. Many analysts of the day regarded Amin&#x27;s appointment as Prime Minister as an increase in his powers at the expense of Taraki. However, the reorganisation of the cabinet and the strengthening of Taraki&#x27;s position as Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, had reduced the authority of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was, due to the strengthening of the executive, now appointed by the Chairman of the Revolutionary Council. While Amin could appoint and dismiss new ministers, he needed Taraki&#x27;s consent to actually do so. Another problem for Amin was that while the Council of Ministers was responsible to the Revolutionary Council and its chairman, individual ministers were only responsible to Taraki. When Amin became Prime Minister, he was responsible for planning, finance and budgetary matters, the conduct of foreign policy, and for order and security. The order and security responsibilities had been taken over by the HHDC, which was chaired by Taraki. While Amin was HHDC Deputy chairman, the majority of HHDC members were members of the anti-Amin faction. For instance, the HHDC membership included Watanjar the Minister of National Defence, Interior Minister Mazdoryar, the President of the Political Affairs of the Armed Forces Mohammad Iqbal, Mohammad Yaqub, the Chief of the General Staff, the Commander of the Afghan Air Force Nazar Mohammad and Assadullah Sarwari the head of ASGA, the Afghan secret police.

The order of precedence had been institutionalised, whereby Taraki was responsible for defence and Amin responsible for assisting Taraki in defence related matters. Amin&#x27;s position was given a further blow by the democratisation of the decision-making process, which allowed its members to contribute; most of them were against Amin. Another problem for Amin was that the office of HHDC Deputy chairman had no specific functions or powers, and the appointment of a new defence minister who opposed him drastically weakened his control over the Ministry of National Defence. The reorganisation of ministers was a further blow to Amin&#x27;s position; he had lost control of the defence ministry, the interior ministry and the ASGA. Amin still had allies at the top, many of them in strategically important positions, for instance, Yaqub was his brother-in-law and the Security Chief in the Ministry of Interior was Sayed Daoud Taroon, who was also later appointed to the HHDC as an ordinary member in April. Amin succeeded in appointing two more of his allies to important positions; Mohammad Sediq Alemyar as Minister of Planning and Khayal Mohammad Katawazi as Minister of Information and Culture; and Faqir Mohammad Faqir was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in April 1978. Amin&#x27;s political position was not secure when Alexei Yepishev, the Head of the Main Political Directorate of the Soviet Army and Navy, visited Kabul. Yepishev met personally with Taraki on 7 April, but never met with Amin. The Soviets were becoming increasingly worried about Amin&#x27;s control over the Afghan military. Even so, during Yepishev&#x27;s visit Amin&#x27;s position was actually strengthened; Taroon was appointed Taraki&#x27;s aide-de-camp.
Soon after, at two cabinet meetings, the strengthening of the executive powers of the Chairman of the Revolutionary Council was proven. Even though Amin was Prime Minister, Taraki chaired the meetings instead of him. Amin&#x27;s presence at these two meetings was not mentioned at all, and it was made clear that Taraki, through his office as Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, also chaired the Council of Ministers. Another problem facing Amin was Taraki&#x27;s policy of autocracy; he tried to deprive the PDPA Politburo of its powers as a party and state decision-making organ. The situation deteriorated when Amin personally warned Taraki that &quot;the prestige and popularity of leaders among the people has no common aspect with a personality cult.&quot;

Factionalism within the PDPA made it ill-prepared to handle the intensified counter-revolutionary activities in the country. Amin tried to win support for the communist government by depicting himself as a devout Muslim. Taraki and Amin blamed different countries for helping the counter-revolutionaries; Amin attacked the United Kingdom and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and played down American and Chinese involvement, while Taraki blamed American imperialism and Iran and Pakistan for supporting the uprising. Amin&#x27;s criticism of the United Kingdom and the BBC fed on the traditional anti-British sentiments held by rural Afghans. In contrast to Taraki, &quot;Amin bent over backwards to avoid making hostile reference to&quot;, China, the United States or other foreign governments. Amin&#x27;s cautious behavior was in deep contrast to the Soviet Union&#x27;s official stance on the situation; it seemed, according to Beverley Male, that the Soviet leadership tried to force a confrontation between Afghanistan and its enemies. Amin also tried to appease the Shia communities by meeting with their leaders; despite this, a section of the Shia leadership called for the continuation of the resistance. Subsequently, a revolt broke out in a Shia populated district in Kabul; this was the first sign of unrest in Kabul since the Saur Revolution. To add to the government&#x27;s problems, Taraki&#x27;s ability to lead the country was questioned – he was a heavy drinker and was not in good health. Amin on the other hand was characterised in this period by portrayals of strong self-discipline. In the summer of 1979 Amin began to disassociate himself from Taraki. On 27 June Amin became a member of the PDPA Politburo, the leading decision-making body in Afghanistan.

===Rise to power===
In-mid July the Soviets made their view official when &quot;Pravda&quot; wrote an article about the situation in Afghanistan; the Soviets did not wish to see Amin become leader of Afghanistan. This triggered a political crisis in Afghanistan, as Amin initiated a policy of extreme repression, which became one of the main reasons for the Soviet intervention later that year. On 28 July, a vote in the PDPA Politburo approved Amin&#x27;s proposal of creating a collective leadership with collective decision-making; this was a blow to Taraki, and many of his supporters were replaced by pro-Amin PDPA members. Ivan Pavlovsky, the Commander of the Soviet Ground Forces, visited Kabul in mid-August to study the situation in Afghanistan. Amin, in a speech just a few days after Pavlovsky&#x27;s arrival, said that he wanted closer relations between Afghanistan and the People&#x27;s Republic of China; in the same speech he hinted that he had reservations about Soviet meddling in Afghanistan. He likened Soviet assistance to Afghanistan with Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s assistance to the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919. Taraki, a delegate to the conference held by the Non-Aligned Movement in Havana, met personally with Andrei Gromyko, the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, to discuss the Afghanistan situation on 9 September. Shah Wali, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who was a supporter of Amin, did not participate in the meeting. This, according to Beverley Male, &quot;suggested that some plot against Amin was in preparation&quot;.

Taraki was instructed to stop-over in Moscow, where the Soviet leaders urged him to remove Amin from power as per the KGB&#x27;s decision, because Amin posed danger. Amin&#x27;s trusted aid, Daoud Taroon, informed Amin of the meeting and the KGB&#x27;s plan. In Kabul, Taraki&#x27;s aides, the Gang of Four (consisting of Watanjar, Mazdoryar, Gulabzoi and Sarwari), planned to assassinate Amin but failed as Amin was informed of their plot. Within hours of Taraki&#x27;s return to Kabul on 11 September, Taraki convened the cabinet &quot;ostensibly to report on the Havana Summit&quot;. Instead of reporting on the summit, Taraki tried to dismiss Amin as Prime Minister. Amin, aware of the murder plot, demanded the Gang of Four to be removed from their posts, but Taraki laughed it off. Taraki sought to neutralise Amin&#x27;s power and influence by requesting that he serve overseas as an ambassador. Amin turned down the proposal, shouting &quot;You are the one who should quit! Because of drink and old age you have taken leave of your senses.&quot;

On 13 September, Taraki invited Amin to the presidential palace for lunch with him and the Gang of Four. Amin turned down the offer, stating he would prefer their resignation rather than lunching with them. Soviet ambassador Puzanov persuaded Amin to make the visit to the Presidential Palace along with Taroon, the Chief of Police, and Nawab Ali, an intelligence officer. Inside the palace on 14 September, bodyguards within the building opened fire on the visitors. Taroon was killed but Amin only sustained an injury and escaped. Amin drove to the Ministry of Defence building, put the Army on high alert and ordered Taraki&#x27;s arrest. At 6:30 pm tanks from the 4th Armoured Corps entered the city and stood at government buildings. Shortly afterwards, Amin returned to the palace with a contingent of Army officers, and placed Taraki under arrest. The Gang of Four, however, had &quot;disappeared&quot; and sought refuge in the Soviet Embassy.

After Taraki&#x27;s arrest, the Soviets tried to rescue Taraki (or, according to other sources, kidnap Amin) via the embassy or Bagram Air Base but the strength of Amin&#x27;s officers repelled their decision to make a move. Amin was told by the Soviets not to punish Taraki and strip him and his comrades of their positions, but Amin ignored them. Amin reportedly discussed the incident with Leonid Brezhnev, and indirectly asked for the permission to kill Taraki, to which Brezhnev replied that it was his choice. Amin, who now believed he had the full support of the Soviets, ordered the death of Taraki. It is believed Taraki was suffocated with pillows on 8 October 1979. The Afghan media would report that the ailing Taraki had died, omitting any mention of his murder. Taraki&#x27;s murder shocked and upset Brezhnev.

===Leadership===

====Domestic policies====
Following Taraki&#x27;s fall from power, Amin was elected Chairman of the Presidum of the Revolutionary Council and General Secretary of the PDPA Central Committee by the PDPA Politburo. The election of Amin as PDPA General Secretary and the removal of Taraki from all party posts was unanimous. The only members of the cabinet replaced when Amin took power were the Gang of Four – Beverley Male saw this as &quot;a clear indication that he had their [the ministers&#x27;] support&quot;. Amin&#x27;s rise to power was followed by a policy of moderation, and attempts to persuade the Afghan people that the regime was not anti-Islamic. Amin&#x27;s government began to invest in the reconstruction, or reparation, of mosques. He also promised the Afghan people freedom of religion. Religious groups were given copies of the Quran, and Amin began to refer to Allah in speeches. He even claimed that the Saur Revolution was &quot;totally based on the principles of Islam&quot;. The campaign proved to be unsuccessful, and many Afghans held Amin responsible for the regime&#x27;s totalitarian behavior. Amin&#x27;s rise to power was officially endorsed by the Jamiatul Ulama on 20 September 1979. Their endorsement led to the official announcement that Amin was a pious Muslim – Amin thus scored a point against the counter-revolutionary propaganda which claimed the communist regime was atheist. Amin also tried to increase his popularity with tribal groups, a feat Taraki had been unable or unwilling to achieve. In a speech to tribal elders Amin was defensive about the Western way he dressed; an official biography was published which depicted Amin in traditional Pashtun clothes. During his short stay in power, Amin became committed to establishing a collective leadership; when Taraki was ousted, Amin promised &quot;from now on there will be no one-man government...&quot;
Attempting to pacify the population, Amin released a list of 18,000 people who had been executed, and blamed the executions on Taraki. The total number of arrested during Taraki&#x27;s and Amin&#x27;s combined reign number between 17,000 and 45,000. Amin was not liked by the Afghan people. During his rule, opposition to the communist regime increased, and the government lost control of the countryside. The state of the Afghan military deteriorated; due to desertions the number of military personnel in the Afghan army decreased from 100,000 in the immediate aftermath of the Saur Revolution, to somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000. Another problem Amin faced was the KGB&#x27;s penetration of the PDPA, the military and the government bureaucracy. While Amin&#x27;s position in Afghanistan was becoming more perilous by the day, his enemies who were exiled in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc were agitating for his removal. Babrak Karmal, the Parchamite leader, met several leading Eastern Bloc figures during this period, and Mohammad Aslam Watanjar, Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy and Assadullah Sarwari wanted to exact revenge upon Amin.

====Foreign policy====
In July 1979, Hafizullah Amin announced that the DRA was not bound by old treaties with Iran regarding the distribution of water from the Helmand River. Iran interpreted this as Afghanistan using Soviet backing to assert themselves in the region. When Amin became leader, he tried to reduce Afghanistan&#x27;s dependence on the Soviet Union. The Soviets were concerned when they received reports that Amin had met personally with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, one of the leading anti-communists in Afghanistan. His general untrustworthiness and his unpopularity amongst Afghans made it more difficult for Amin to find new &quot;foreign patrons&quot;. Amin&#x27;s involvement in the death of Adolph Dubs, the American Ambassador to Afghanistan, strained his relations with the United States. He tried to improve relations by reestablishing contact, met with three different American chargé d&#x27;affaires, and was interviewed by an American correspondent. But this did not improve Afghanistan&#x27;s standing in the eyes of the United States Government. After the third meeting with Amin, J. Bruce Amstutz, the American Ambassador to Afghanistan from 1979 to 1980, believed the wisest thing to do was to maintain &quot;a low profile, trying to avoid issues, and waiting to see what happens&quot;. In early December 1979, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed a joint summit meeting between Amin and Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the President of Pakistan. The Pakistani Government, accepting a modified version of the offer, agreed to send Agha Shahi, the Pakistani foreign minister, to Kabul for talks. In the meanwhile, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistani&#x27;s secret police, continued to train Mujahideen fighters who opposed Amin&#x27;s regime.

====Afghan-Soviet relations====
Contrary to popular belief, the Soviet leadership headed by Leonid Brezhnev, Alexei Kosygin and the Politburo, were not eager to send troops to Afghanistan. The Soviet Politburo decisions were guided by a Special Commission on Afghanistan, which consisted of Yuri Andropov the KGB chairman, Andrei Gromyko the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Defence Minister Dmitriy Ustinov, and Boris Ponomarev, the head of the International Department of the Central Committee. The Politburo was opposed to the removal of Taraki and his subsequent murder. According to Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, &quot;Events developed so swiftly in Afghanistan that essentially there was little opportunity to somehow interfere in them. Right now our mission is to determine our further actions, so as to preserve our position in Afghanistan and to secure our influence there.&quot; Although Afghan–Soviet relations deteriorated during Amin&#x27;s short stint in power, he was invited on an official visit to Moscow by Alexander Puzanov, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, because of the Soviet leadership&#x27;s satisfaction with his party and state-building policy. Not everything went as planned, and Andropov talked about &quot;the undesirable turn of events&quot; taking place in Afghanistan under Amin&#x27;s rule. Andropov also brought up the ongoing political shift in Afghanistan under Amin; the Soviets were afraid that Amin would move Afghanistan&#x27;s foreign policy from a pro-Soviet position to a pro-United States position. By early-to-mid December 1979, the Soviet leadership had established an alliance with Babrak Karmal and Assadullah Sarwari.
Amin kept a portrait of Joseph Stalin on his desk. When Soviet officials criticized him of his brutality, Amin replied &quot;Comrade Stalin showed us how to build socialism in a backward country.&quot;

As it turned out, the relationship between Puzanov and Amin broke down. Amin started a smear campaign to discredit Puzanov. This in turn led to an assassination attempt against Amin, in which Puzanov participated. The situation was worsened by the KGB accusing Amin of misrepresenting the Soviet position on Afghanistan in the PDPA Central Committee and the Revolutionary Council. The KGB also noted an increase in anti-Soviet agitation by the government during Amin&#x27;s rule, and harassment against Soviet citizens increased under Amin. A group of senior politicians reported to the Soviet Central Committee that it was necessary to do &quot;everything possible&quot; to prevent a change in political orientation in Afghanistan. However, the Soviet leadership did not advocate intervention at this time, and instead called for increasing its influence in the Amin leadership to expose his &quot;true intentions&quot;. A Soviet Politburo assessment referred to Amin as &quot;a power-hungry leader who is distinguished by brutality and treachery&quot;. Amongst the many sins they alleged were his &quot;insincerity and duplicity&quot; when dealing with the Soviet Union, creating fictitious accusations against PDPA-members who opposed him, indulging in a policy of nepotism, and his tendency to conduct a more &quot;balanced policy&quot; towards First World countries. According to the former senior Soviet diplomat, Oleg Grinevsky, the KGB was becoming increasingly convinced that Amin couldn&#x27;t be counted on to effectively deal with the insurgency and preserve the survival of the Afghan Marxist state.

By the end of October the Special Commission on Afghanistan, which consisted of Andropov, Gromyko, Ustinov and Ponomarev, wanted to end the impression that the Soviet government supported Amin&#x27;s leadership and policy. The KGB&#x27;s First Chief Directorate was put under orders that something had to be done about Afghanistan, and several of its personnel were assembled to deal with the task. Andropov fought hard for Soviet intervention, saying to Brezhnev that Amin&#x27;s policies had destroyed the military and the government&#x27;s capabilities to handle the crisis by use of mass repression. The plan, according to Andropov, was to assemble a small force to intervene and remove Amin from power and replace him with Karmal. The Soviet Union declared its plan to intervene in Afghanistan on 12 December 1979; large numbers of Soviet airborne troops landed in Kabul on 25 December, with the approval of Amin who miscalculated their intentions. Soviet leadership initiated Operation Storm-333 (the first phase of the intervention) on 27 December 1979.

====Attempted poisoning by Amin&#x27;s chef====
The leadership of the USSR had no need for Amin to remain alive. Andropov&#x27;s special representative in Afghanistan, General Boris Ivanov, recommended for Amin to attend a conciliatory dinner with his political mentor, who had become an enemy of Amin, so that Amin&#x27;s chef could poison Amin. However, Amin survived the poisoning after being treated by doctors at the Soviet embassy, who did not know that &quot;special reconnaissance officers&quot; were trying to kill Amin. Since Amin, who was very loyal to the USSR, had survived two attempted assassinations that had been approved by the USSR, the decision was made to eliminate him through a bloody coup at Amin&#x27;s residence, the Tajbeg Palace.

====Death====
Amin trusted the Soviet Union until the very end, despite the deterioration of official relations, and was unaware that the tide in Moscow had turned against him since he ordered Taraki&#x27;s death. When the Afghan intelligence service handed Amin a report that the Soviet Union would invade the country and topple him, Amin claimed that the report was a product of imperialism. His view can be explained by the fact that the Soviet Union, after several months, finally gave in to Amin&#x27;s demands and sent troops into Afghanistan to secure the PDPA government. Contrary to common Western belief, Amin was informed of the Soviet decision to send troops into Afghanistan. General Tukharinov, commander of the 40th Army, met with Afghan Major General Babadzhan to talk about Soviet troop movements before the Soviet army&#x27;s intervention. On 25 December, Dmitry Ustinov issued a formal order, stating that &quot;[t]he state frontier of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is to be crossed on the ground and in the air by forces of the 40th Army and the Air Force at 1500 hrs on 25 December&quot;. This was the formal beginning of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.

Concerned for his safety, on 20 December Amin moved from the Presidential Palace, located in the centre of Kabul, to the Tajbeg Palace, which had previously been the headquarters of the Central Corps of the Afghan Army. The palace was formidable, with walls strong enough to withstand artillery fire. According to Rodric Braithwaite, &quot;its defences had been carefully and intelligently organised&quot;. All roads to the palace had been mined, with the exception of one, which had heavy machine guns and artillery positioned to defend it. To make matters worse for the Soviets, the Afghans had established a second line of defence which consisted of seven posts, &quot;each manned by four sentries armed with a machine gun, a mortar, and automatic rifles&quot;. The external defences of the palace were handled by the Presidential Guard, which consisted of 2,500 troops and three T-54 tanks. Several Soviet commanders involved in the assassination of Amin thought the plan to attack the palace was &quot;crazy&quot;. Although the military had been informed by the Soviet leadership through their commanders, Yuri Drozdov and Vasily Kolesnik, that the leader was a &quot;CIA agent&quot; who had betrayed the Saur Revolution, many Soviet soldiers hesitated; despite what their commanders had told them, it seemed implausible that Amin, the leader of the PDPA government, was an American double agent. Despite several objections, the plan to assassinate Amin went ahead.

Before resorting to killing Amin by brute force, the Soviets had tried to poison him as early as 13 December (but nearly killed his nephew instead) and to kill him with a sniper shot on his way to work (this proved impossible as the Afghans had improved their security measures). They even tried to poison Amin just hours before the assault on the Presidential Palace on 27 December. Amin had organised a lunch for party members to show guests his palace and to celebrate Ghulam Dastagir Panjsheri&#x27;s return from Moscow. Panjsheri&#x27;s return improved the mood even further; he boasted that he and Gromyko always kept in contact with each other. During the meal, Amin and several of his guests lost consciousness as they had been poisoned. Amin survived his encounter with death, because the carbonation of the Coca-Cola he was drinking diluted the toxic agent. Mikhail Talybov, a KGB agent, was given responsibility for the poisonings.

The assault on the palace began shortly afterward. During the attack Amin still believed the Soviet Union was on his side, and told his adjutant, &quot;The Soviets will help us&quot;. The adjutant replied that it was the Soviets who were attacking them; Amin initially replied that this was a lie. Only after he tried but failed to contact the Chief of the General Staff, he muttered, &quot;I guessed it. It&#x27;s all true&quot;. There are various accounts of how Amin died, but the exact details have never been confirmed. Amin was either killed by a deliberate attack or died by a &quot;random burst of fire&quot;. Amin&#x27;s son was fatally wounded and died shortly after. His daughter was wounded, but survived. It was Gulabzoy who had been given orders to kill Amin and Watanjar who later confirmed his death. The men of Amin&#x27;s family were all executed either immediately or shortly thereafter (his brother Abdullah and nephew Asadullah were executed in June 1980). The women including his daughter were imprisoned at Pul-e-Charkhi prison until being released by President Najibullah in early 1992. After Amin&#x27;s death on 27 December 1979, Radio Kabul broadcast Babrak Karmal&#x27;s pre-recorded speech to the Afghan people, saying: &quot;Today the torture machine of Amin has been smashed&quot;. Karmal was installed by the Soviets as the new leader while the Soviet Army began its intervention in Afghanistan that would last for nine years.

==Post-death==
On 2 January 1980 on the PDPA&#x27;s 15th anniversary, Karmal who was now the new General Secretary called Amin a &quot;conspirator, professional criminal and recognised spy of the U.S.&quot;, as reported in the &quot;Kabul New Times&quot;. Anahita Ratebzad, the education minister, said about Amin:

: ...this wrathy, cruel and criminal murderer who had made terror and suppression and crushing of every opposition force part and parcel of his way of rule, and started every day with new acts of destruction, putting opponents of his bloody regime, group by group, to places of torture, jails, and slaughterhouses.

<doc id="14282" wikidata="Q735766" url="?curid=14282" title="Hubris">
<text>Hubris (; ), or less frequently hybris (), describes a personality quality of extreme or excessive pride or dangerous overconfidence and , often in combination with (or synonymous with) arrogance. The term &quot;arrogance&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;to feel that one has a right to demand certain attitudes and behaviors from other people&quot;. To &quot;arrogate&quot; means &quot;to claim or seize without justification... To make undue claims to having&quot;, or &quot;to claim or seize without right... to ascribe or attribute without reason&quot;. The term &quot;pretension&quot; is also associated with the term &quot;hubris&quot;, but is not synonymous with it.

According to studies, hubris, arrogance, and pretension are related to the need for victory (even if it does not always mean winning) instead of reconciliation, which &quot;friendly&quot; groups might promote. Hubris is usually perceived as a characteristic of an individual rather than a group, although the group the offender belongs to may suffer collateral consequences from wrongful acts. Hubris often indicates a loss of contact with reality and an overestimation of one&#x27;s own competence, accomplishments, or capabilities. The adjectival form of the noun &quot;hubris&quot;/&quot;hybris&quot; is &quot;hubristic&quot;/&quot;hybristic&quot;.

The term &quot;hubris&quot; originated in Ancient Greek, where it had several different meanings depending on the context. In legal usage, it meant assault or sexual crimes and theft of public property, and in religious usage it meant of divinity or transgression against a god.

== Ancient Greek origin ==
In ancient Greek, &quot;hubris&quot; referred to &quot;outrage&quot;: actions that violated natural order, or which shamed and humiliated the victim, sometimes for the pleasure or gratification of the abuser. 

=== Mythological usage ===

Hesiod and Aeschylus used the word &quot;hubris&quot; to describe transgressions against the gods. A common way that hubris was committed was when a mortal claimed to be better than a god in a particular skill or attribute. Claims like these were rarely left unpunished, and so Arachne, a talented young weaver, was transformed into a spider when she said that her skills exceeded those of the goddess Athena. Additional examples include Icarus, Phaethon, Salmoneus, Niobe, Cassiopeia, Tantalus, and Tereus. 

The goddess Hybris is described in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition as having &quot;insolent encroachment upon the rights of others&quot;.

These events were not limited to myth, and certain figures in history were considered to have been punished for committing hubris through their arrogance. One such person was king Xerxes as portrayed in Aeschylus&#x27;s play &quot;The Persians&quot;, and who allegedly threw chains to bind the Hellespont sea as punishment for daring to destroy his fleet.

What is common in all of these examples is the breaching of limits, as the Greeks believed that the Fates (Μοῖραι) had assigned each being with a particular area of freedom, an area that even the gods could not breach.

=== Legal usage ===
In ancient Athens, hubris was defined as the use of violence to shame the victim (this sense of hubris could also characterize rape). In legal terms, hubristic violations of the law included what might today be termed assault-and-battery, sexual crimes, or the theft of public or sacred property. In some contexts, the term had a sexual connotation. Shame was frequently reflected upon the perpetrator, as well.

Crucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of honour (τιμή, &quot;timē&quot;) and shame (αἰδώς, &quot;aidōs&quot;). The concept of honour included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honour, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris. This concept of honour is akin to a zero-sum game. Rush Rehm simplifies this definition of hubris to the contemporary concept of &quot;insolence, contempt, and excessive violence&quot;.

Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of Demosthenes, a prominent statesman and orator in ancient Greece. These two examples occurred when first Midias punched Demosthenes in the face in the theatre (&quot;Against Midias&quot;), and second when (in &quot;Against Conon&quot;) a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim. Yet another example of hubris appears in Aeschines&#x27; &quot;Against Timarchus&quot;, where the defendant, Timarchus, is accused of breaking the law of hubris by submitting himself to prostitution and anal intercourse. Aeschines brought this suit against Timarchus to bar him from the rights of political office and his case succeeded. Aristotle defined hubris as shaming the victim, not because of anything that happened to the committer or might happen to the committer, but merely for that committer&#x27;s own gratification:

to cause shame to the victim, not in order that anything may happen to you, nor because anything has happened to you, but merely for your own gratification. Hubris is not the requital of past injuries; this is revenge. As for the pleasure in hubris, its cause is this: naive men think that by ill-treating others they make their own superiority the greater.

=== Early Christianity===
In the Septuagint, the &quot;hubris is pride, ness or arrogance, often resulting in fatal retribution or &quot;. The word &quot;hubris&quot; as used in the New Testament parallels the Hebrew word &quot;pesha&quot;, meaning &quot;transgression&quot;. It represents a pride that &quot;makes a man defy God&quot;, sometimes to the degree that he considers himself an equal.

== Modern usage ==
In its modern usage, hubris denotes overconfident pride combined with arrogance. Hubris is also referred to as &quot;pride that blinds&quot; because it often causes a committer of hubris to act in foolish ways that belie common sense.
=== Arrogance ===

The Oxford English Dictionary defines &quot;arrogance&quot; in terms of &quot;high or inflated opinion of one&#x27;s own abilities, importance, etc., that gives rise to presumption or excessive self-confidence, or to a feeling or attitude of being superior to others [...].&quot; Adrian Davies sees arrogance as more generic and less severe than hubris.

<text>Heavy water (deuterium oxide, &#x27;, &#x27;) is a form of water in which hydrogen atoms are all deuterium ( or D, also known as &quot;heavy hydrogen&quot;) rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope (, also called &quot;protium&quot;) that makes up most of the hydrogen in normal water. The presence of the heavier isotope gives the water different nuclear properties, and the increase in mass gives it slightly different physical and chemical properties when compared to normal water.

Deuterium is a heavy hydrogen isotope. Heavy water contains deuterium atoms and is used in nuclear reactors. Semiheavy water (HDO) is more common than pure heavy water, while heavy-oxygen water is denser but lacks unique properties. Tritiated water is radioactive due to tritium content.

Heavy water has different physical properties from regular water, such as being 10.6% denser and having a higher melting point. Heavy water is less dissociated at a given temperature, and it does not have the slightly blue color of regular water. It can taste slightly sweeter than regular water, though not to a significant degree. Heavy water affects biological systems by altering enzymes, hydrogen bonds, and cell division in eukaryotes. It can be lethal to multicellular organisms at concentrations over 50%. However, some prokaryotes like bacteria can survive in a heavy hydrogen environment. Heavy water can be toxic to humans, but a large amount would be needed for poisoning to occur.

The most cost-effective process for producing heavy water is the Girdler sulfide process. Heavy water is used in various industries and is sold in different grades of purity. Some of its applications include nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared spectroscopy, neutron moderation, neutrino detection, metabolic rate testing, neutron capture therapy, and the production of radioactive materials such as plutonium and tritium. 

== Composition ==

The deuterium nucleus consists of a neutron and a proton; the nucleus of a protium (normal hydrogen) atom consists of just a proton. The additional neutron makes a deuterium atom roughly twice as heavy as a protium atom.

A molecule of heavy water has two deuterium atoms in place of the two protium atoms of ordinary water. The term heavy water as defined by the IUPAC Gold Book can also refer to water in which a higher than usual proportion of hydrogen atoms are deuterium. For comparison, Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (the &quot;ordinary water&quot; used for a deuterium standard) contains about 156 deuterium atoms per million hydrogen atoms; that is, 0.0156% of the hydrogen atoms are H. Thus heavy water as defined by the Gold Book includes semiheavy water (hydrogen-deuterium oxide, HDO) and other mixtures of , , and HDO in which the proportion of deuterium is greater than usual. For instance, the heavy water used in CANDU reactors is a highly enriched water mixture that is mostly deuterium oxide , but also some hydrogen-deuterium oxide and a smaller amount of ordinary water . It is 99.75% enriched by hydrogen atom-fraction; that is, 99.75% of the hydrogen atoms are of the heavy type; however, heavy water in the Gold Book sense need not be so highly enriched. The weight of a heavy water molecule, however, is not very different from that of a normal water molecule, because about 89% of the mass of the molecule comes from the single oxygen atom rather than the two hydrogen atoms.

Heavy water is not radioactive. In its pure form, it has a density about 11% greater than water but is otherwise physically and chemically similar. Nevertheless, the various differences in deuterium-containing water (especially affecting the biological properties) are larger than in any other commonly occurring isotope-substituted compound because deuterium is unique among heavy stable isotopes in being twice as heavy as the lightest isotope. This difference increases the strength of water&#x27;s hydrogen–oxygen bonds, and this in turn is enough to cause differences that are important to some biochemical reactions. The human body naturally contains deuterium equivalent to about five grams of heavy water, which is harmless. When a large fraction of water (&gt; 50%) in higher organisms is replaced by heavy water, the result is cell dysfunction and death.

Heavy water was first produced in 1932, a few months after the discovery of deuterium. With the discovery of nuclear fission in late 1938, and the need for a neutron moderator that captured few neutrons, heavy water became a component of early nuclear energy research. Since then, heavy water has been an essential component in some types of reactors, both those that generate power and those designed to produce isotopes for nuclear weapons. These heavy water reactors have the advantage of being able to run on natural uranium without using graphite moderators that pose radiological and dust explosion hazards in the decommissioning phase. The graphite moderated Soviet RBMK design tried to avoid using either enriched uranium or heavy water (being cooled with ordinary water instead) which produced the positive void coefficient that was one of a series of flaws in reactor design leading to the Chernobyl disaster. Most modern reactors use enriched uranium with ordinary water as the moderator.

==Other heavy forms of water==
===Semiheavy water===

Semiheavy water, HDO, exists whenever there is water with light hydrogen (protium, ) and deuterium (D or ) in the mix. This is because hydrogen atoms (H and H) are rapidly exchanged between water molecules. Water containing 50% and 50% in its hydrogen, is actually about 50% HDO and 25% each of and , in dynamic equilibrium.
In normal water, about 1 molecule in 3,200 is HDO (one hydrogen in 6,400 is ), and heavy water molecules () only occur in a proportion of about 1 molecule in 41 million (i.e. one in 6,400). Thus semiheavy water molecules are far more common than &quot;pure&quot; (homoisotopic) heavy water molecules.

===Heavy-oxygen water===
Water enriched in the heavier oxygen isotopes  and  is also commercially available. It is &quot;heavy water&quot; as it is denser than normal water ( is approximately as dense as , is about halfway between and )—but is rarely called heavy water, since it does not contain the excess deuterium that gives DO its unusual nuclear and biological properties. It is more expensive than DO due to the more difficult separation of O and O. HO is also used for production of fluorine-18 in radiopharmaceuticals and radiotracers, and positron emission tomography. Small amounts of and are naturally present in water, and most processes enriching heavy water also enrich heavier isotopes of oxygen as a side-effect. This is undesirable if the heavy water is to be used as a neutron moderator in nuclear reactors, as can undergo neutron capture, followed by emission of an alpha particle, producing radioactive . However, doubly labeled water, containing both a heavy oxygen and hydrogen, is useful as a non-radioactive isotopic tracer.

Compared to the isotopic change of hydrogen atoms, the isotopic change of oxygen has a smaller effect on the physical properties.

===Tritiated water===
Tritiated water contains tritium (H) in place of protium (H) or deuterium (H). Since tritium is radioactive, tritiated water is also radioactive.

==Physical properties==

The physical properties of water and heavy water differ in several respects. Heavy water is less dissociated than light water at given temperature, and the true concentration of D ions is less than ions would be for light water at the same temperature. The same is true of OD vs. ions. For heavy water Kw DO (25.0 °C) = 1.35 × 10, and [D] must equal [OD] for neutral water. Thus pKw DO = p[OD] + p[D] = 7.44 + 7.44 = 14.87 (25.0 °C), and the p[D] of neutral heavy water at 25.0 °C is 7.44.

The pD of heavy water is generally measured using pH electrodes giving a pH (apparent) value, or pHa, and at various temperatures a true acidic pD can be estimated from the directly pH meter measured pHa, such that pD+ = pHa (apparent reading from pH meter) + 0.41. The electrode correction for alkaline conditions is 0.456 for heavy water. The alkaline correction is then pD+ = pH(apparent reading from pH meter) + 0.456. These corrections are slightly different from the differences in p[D+] and p[OD-] of 0.44 from the corresponding ones in heavy water.

Heavy water is 10.6% denser than ordinary water, and heavy water&#x27;s physically different properties can be seen without equipment if a frozen sample is dropped into normal water, as it will sink. If the water is ice-cold the higher melting temperature of heavy ice can also be observed: it melts at 3.7 °C, and thus does not melt in ice-cold normal water.

A 1935 experiment reported not the &quot;slightest difference&quot; in taste between ordinary and heavy water. However, a more recent study confirmed anecdotal observation that heavy water tastes slightly sweet to humans, with the effect mediated by the TAS1R2/TAS1R3 taste receptor. Rats given a choice between distilled normal water and heavy water were able to avoid the heavy water based on smell, and it may have a different taste. Some people report that minerals in water affect taste, e.g. potassium lending a sweet taste to hard water, but there are many factors of a perceived taste in water besides mineral contents.

Heavy water lacks the characteristic blue color of light water; this is because the molecular vibration harmonics, which in light water cause weak absorption in the red part of the visible spectrum, are shifted into the infrared and thus heavy water does not absorb red light.

No physical properties are listed for &quot;pure&quot; semi-heavy water because it is unstable as a bulk liquid. In the liquid state, a few water molecules are always in an ionized state, which means the hydrogen atoms can exchange among different oxygen atoms. Semi-heavy water could, in theory, be created via a chemical method, but it would rapidly transform into a dynamic mixture of 25% light water, 25% heavy water, and 50% semi-heavy. However, if it were made in the gas phase and directly deposited into a solid, semi-heavy water in the form of ice could be stable. This is due to collisions between water vapor molecules being almost completely negligible in the gas phase at standard temperatures, and once crystallized, collisions between the molecules cease altogether due to the rigid lattice structure of solid ice.

Heavy water exchanges with atmospheric water until it reaches the usual hydrogen-isotopic ratio.

==History==
The US scientist and Nobel laureate Harold Urey discovered the isotope deuterium in 1931 and was later able to concentrate it in water. Urey&#x27;s mentor Gilbert Newton Lewis isolated the first sample of pure heavy water by electrolysis in 1933. George de Hevesy and Erich Hofer used heavy water in 1934 in one of the first biological tracer experiments, to estimate the rate of turnover of water in the human body. The history of large-quantity production and use of heavy water, in early nuclear experiments, is described below.

Emilian Bratu and Otto Redlich studied the autodissociation of heavy water in 1934.

In the 1930s, it was suspected by the United States and Soviet Union that Austrian chemist Fritz Johann Hansgirg built a pilot plant for the Empire of Japan in Japanese ruled northern Korea to produce heavy water by using a new process he had invented.

During the second World War, the company Fosfatbolaget in Ljungaverk, Sweden, produced 2,300 liters per year of heavy water. The heavy water was then sold both to Germany and to the Manhattan Project for the price of 1,40 SEK per gram of heavy water.

In October 1939, Soviet physicists Yakov Borisovich Zel&#x27;dovich and Yulii Borisovich Khariton concluded that heavy water and carbon were the only feasible moderators for a natural uranium reactor, and in August 1940, along with Georgy Flyorov, submitted a plan to the Russian Academy of Sciences calculating that 15 tons of heavy water were needed for a reactor. With the Soviet Union having no uranium mines at the time, young Academy workers were sent to Leningrad photographic shops to buy uranium nitrate, but the entire heavy water project was halted in 1941 when German forces invaded during Operation Barbarossa.

By 1943, Soviet scientists had discovered that all scientific literature relating to heavy water had disappeared from the West, which Flyorov in a letter warned Soviet leader Joseph Stalin about, and at which time there was only 2–3 kg of heavy water in the entire country. In late 1943, the Soviet purchasing commission in the U.S. obtained 1 kg of heavy water and a further 100 kg in February 1945, and upon World War II ending, the NKVD took over the project.

In October 1946, as part of the Russian Alsos, the NKVD deported to the Soviet Union from Germany the German scientists who had worked on heavy water production during the war, including Karl-Hermann Geib, the inventor of the Girdler sulfide process. These German scientists worked under the supervision of German physical chemist Max Volmer at the Institute of Physical Chemistry in Moscow with the plant they constructed producing large quantities of heavy water by 1948.

==Effect on biological systems==
Different isotopes of chemical elements have slightly different chemical behaviors, but for most elements the differences are far too small to have a biological effect. In the case of hydrogen, larger differences in chemical properties among protium, deuterium, and tritium occur because chemical bond energy depends on the reduced mass of the nucleus–electron system; this is altered in heavy-hydrogen compounds (hydrogen-deuterium oxide is the most common) more than for heavy-isotope substitution involving other chemical elements. The isotope effects are especially relevant in biological systems, which are very sensitive to even the smaller changes, due to isotopically influenced properties of water when it acts as a solvent.

To perform their tasks, enzymes rely on their finely tuned networks of hydrogen bonds, both in the active center with their substrates and outside the active center, to stabilize their tertiary structures. As a hydrogen bond with deuterium is slightly stronger than one involving ordinary hydrogen, in a highly deuterated environment, some normal reactions in cells are disrupted.

Particularly hard-hit by heavy water are the delicate assemblies of mitotic spindle formations necessary for cell division in eukaryotes. Plants stop growing and seeds do not germinate when given only heavy water, because heavy water stops eukaryotic cell division. Tobacco does not germinate, but wheat does. The deuterium cell is larger and is a modification of the direction of division. The cell membrane also changes, and it reacts first to the impact of heavy water. In 1972, it was demonstrated that an increase in the percentage of deuterium in water reduces plant growth. Research conducted on the growth of prokaryote microorganisms in artificial conditions of a heavy hydrogen environment showed that in this environment, all the hydrogen atoms of water could be replaced with deuterium. Experiments showed that bacteria can live in 98% heavy water. Concentrations over 50% are lethal to multicellular organisms, but a few exceptions are known: plant species such as switchgrass (&quot;Panicum virgatum&quot;) which is able to grow on 50% D2O; &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; (70% DO); &quot;Vesicularia dubyana&quot; (85% D2O); &quot;Funaria hygrometrica&quot; (90% DO); and the anhydrobiotic species of nematode &quot;Panagrolaimus superbus&quot; (nearly 100% DO).

A comprehensive study of heavy water on the fission yeast &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; showed that the cells displayed an altered glucose metabolism and slow growth at high concentrations of heavy water. In addition, the cells activated the heat-shock response pathway and the cell integrity pathway, and mutants in the cell integrity pathway displayed increased tolerance to heavy water. Despite its toxicity at high levels, heavy water has been observed to extend lifespan of certain yeasts by up to 85%, with the hypothesized mechanism being the reduction of reactive oxygen species turnover.

Heavy water affects the period of circadian oscillations, consistently increasing the length of each cycle. The effect has been demonstrated in unicellular organisms, green plants, isopods, insects, birds, mice, and hamsters. The mechanism is unknown.

Like ethanol, heavy water temporarily changes the relative density of cupula relative to the endolymph in the vestibular organ, causing positional nystagmus, illusions of bodily rotations, dizziness, and nausea. However, the direction of nystagmus is in the opposite direction of ethanol, since it is denser than water, not lighter.

===Effect on animals===
Experiments with mice, rats, and dogs have shown that a degree of 25% deuteration prevents gametes or zygotes from developing, causing (sometimes irreversible) sterility. High concentrations of heavy water (90%) rapidly kill fish, tadpoles, flatworms, and &quot;Drosophila&quot;. Mice raised from birth with 30% heavy water have 25% deuteration in body fluid and 10% in brains. They are normal except for sterility. Deuteration during pregnancy induces fetal abnormality. Higher deuteration in body fluid causes death. Mammals (for example, rats) given heavy water to drink die after a week, at a time when their body water approaches about 50% deuteration. The mode of death appears to be the same as that in cytotoxic poisoning (such as chemotherapy) or in acute radiation syndrome (though deuterium is not radioactive), and is caused by deuterium&#x27;s action in generally inhibiting cell division. It is more toxic to malignant cells than normal cells, but the concentrations needed are too high for regular use. As may occur in chemotherapy, deuterium-poisoned mammals die of a failure of bone marrow (producing bleeding and infections) and of intestinal-barrier functions (producing diarrhea and loss of fluids).

Despite the problems of plants and animals in living with too much deuterium, prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria, which do not have the mitotic problems induced by deuterium, may be grown and propagated in fully deuterated conditions, resulting in replacement of all hydrogen atoms in the bacterial proteins and DNA with the deuterium isotope. This leads to a process of bootstrapping. With prokaryotes producing fully deuterated glucose, fully deuterated &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Torula&quot; were raised, and they could produce even more complex fully deuterated chemicals. Molds like &quot;Aspergillus&quot; could not replicate under fully deuterated conditions.

In higher organisms, full replacement with heavy isotopes can be accomplished with other non-radioactive heavy isotopes (such as carbon-13, nitrogen-15, and oxygen-18), but this cannot be done for deuterium. This is a consequence of the ratio of nuclear masses between the isotopes of hydrogen, which is much greater than for any other element.

Deuterium oxide is used to enhance boron neutron capture therapy, but this effect does not rely on the biological or chemical effects of deuterium, but instead on deuterium&#x27;s ability to moderate (slow) neutrons without capturing them. 2021 experimental evidence indicates that systemic administration of deuterium oxide (30% drinking water supplementation) suppresses tumor growth in a standard mouse model of human melanoma, an effect attributed to selective induction of cellular stress signaling and gene expression in tumor cells.

===Toxicity in humans===
Because it would take a very large amount of heavy water to replace 25% to 50% of a human being&#x27;s body water (water being in turn 50–75% of body weight) with heavy water, accidental or intentional poisoning with heavy water is unlikely to the point of practical disregard. Poisoning would require that the victim ingest large amounts of heavy water without significant normal water intake for many days to produce any noticeable toxic effects.

Oral doses of heavy water in the range of several grams, as well as heavy oxygen O, are routinely used in human metabolic experiments. (See doubly labeled water testing.) Since one in about every 6,400 hydrogen atoms is deuterium, a human containing of body water would normally contain enough deuterium (about ) to make of pure heavy water, so roughly this dose is required to double the amount of deuterium in the body.

A loss of blood pressure may partially explain the reported incidence of dizziness upon ingestion of heavy water. However, it is more likely that this symptom can be attributed to altered vestibular function. Heavy water, like ethanol, causes a temporary difference in the density of endolymph within the cupula, which confuses the vestibulo-ocular reflex and causes motion sickness symptoms.

===Heavy water radiation contamination confusion===
Although many people associate heavy water primarily with its use in nuclear reactors, pure heavy water is not radioactive. Commercial-grade heavy water is slightly radioactive due to the presence of minute traces of natural tritium, but the same is true of ordinary water. Heavy water that has been used as a coolant in nuclear power plants contains substantially more tritium as a result of neutron bombardment of the deuterium in the heavy water (tritium is a health risk when ingested in large quantities).

In 1990, a disgruntled employee at the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station in Canada obtained a sample (estimated as about a &quot;half cup&quot;) of heavy water from the primary heat transport loop of the nuclear reactor, and loaded it into a cafeteria drink dispenser. Eight employees drank some of the contaminated water. The incident was discovered when employees began leaving bioassay urine samples with elevated tritium levels. The quantity of heavy water involved was far below levels that could induce heavy water toxicity, but several employees received elevated radiation doses from tritium and neutron-activated chemicals in the water. This was not an incident of heavy water poisoning, but rather radiation poisoning from other isotopes in the heavy water.

Some news services were not careful to distinguish these points, and some of the public were left with the impression that heavy water is normally radioactive and more severely toxic than it actually is. Even if pure heavy water had been used in the water dispenser indefinitely, it is not likely the incident would have been detected or caused harm, since no employee would be expected to get much more than 25% of their daily drinking water from such a source.

==Production methods==
The most cost-effective process for producing heavy water is the dual temperature exchange sulfide process (known as the Girdler sulfide process) developed in parallel by Karl-Hermann Geib and Jerome S. Spevack in 1943. An alternative process, patented by Graham M. Keyser, uses lasers to selectively dissociate deuterated hydrofluorocarbons to form deuterium fluoride, which can then be separated by physical means. Although the energy consumption for this process is much less than for the Girdler sulfide process, this method is currently uneconomical due to the expense of procuring the necessary hydrofluorocarbons.

As noted, modern commercial heavy water is almost universally referred to, and sold as, deuterium oxide. It is most often sold in various grades of purity, from 98% enrichment to 99.75–99.98% deuterium enrichment (nuclear reactor grade) and occasionally even higher isotopic purity.
==Production by country==
===Argentina===
Argentina was the main producer of heavy water, using an ammonia/hydrogen exchange based plant supplied by Switzerland&#x27;s Sulzer company. It was also a major exporter to Canada, Germany, the US and other countries. The heavy water production facility located in Arroyito was the world&#x27;s largest heavy water production facility. Argentina produced of heavy water per year in 2015 using the &quot;monothermal ammonia-hydrogen isotopic exchange&quot; method. Since 2017, the Arroyito plant has not been operational.

===United States===
During the Manhattan Project the United States constructed three heavy water production plants as part of the P-9 Project at Morgantown Ordnance Works, near Morgantown, West Virginia; at the Wabash River Ordnance Works, near Dana and Newport, Indiana; and at the Alabama Ordnance Works, near Childersburg and Sylacauga, Alabama. Heavy water was also acquired from the Cominco plant in Trail, British Columbia, Canada. The Chicago Pile-3 experimental reactor used heavy water as a moderator and went critical in 1944. The three domestic production plants were shut down in 1945 after producing around of product. The Wabash plant resumed heavy water production in 1952.

In 1953, the United States began using heavy water in plutonium production reactors at the Savannah River Site. The first of the five heavy water reactors came online in 1953, and the last was placed in cold shutdown in 1996. The reactors were heavy water reactors so that they could produce both plutonium and tritium for the US nuclear weapons program.

The U.S. developed the Girdler sulfide chemical exchange production process—which was first demonstrated on a large scale at the Dana, Indiana plant in 1945 and at the Savannah River Site in 1952.

===India===
India is the world&#x27;s largest producer of heavy water through its Heavy Water Board. It exports heavy water to countries including the Republic of Korea, China, and the United States.

===Norway===
In 1934, Norsk Hydro built the first commercial heavy water plant at Vemork, Tinn, eventually producing per day. From 1940 and throughout World War II, the plant was under German control, and the Allies decided to destroy the plant and its heavy water to inhibit German development of nuclear weapons. In late 1942, a planned raid called Operation Freshman by British airborne troops failed, both gliders crashing. The raiders were killed in the crash or subsequently executed by the Germans.

On the night of 27 February 1943 Operation Gunnerside succeeded. Norwegian commandos and local resistance managed to demolish small, but key parts of the electrolytic cells, dumping the accumulated heavy water down the factory drains.

On 16 November 1943, the Allied air forces dropped more than 400 bombs on the site. The Allied air raid prompted the Nazi government to move all available heavy water to Germany for safekeeping. On 20 February 1944, a Norwegian partisan sank the ferry M/F &quot;Hydro&quot; carrying heavy water across Lake Tinn, at the cost of 14 Norwegian civilian lives, and most of the heavy water was presumably lost. A few of the barrels were only half full, hence buoyant, and may have been salvaged and transported to Germany.

Recent investigation of production records at Norsk Hydro and analysis of an intact barrel that was salvaged in 2004 revealed that although the barrels in this shipment contained water of pH 14—indicative of the alkaline electrolytic refinement process—they did not contain high concentrations of DO. Despite the apparent size of the shipment, the total quantity of pure heavy water was quite small, most barrels only containing 0.5–1% pure heavy water. The Germans would have needed about 5 tons of heavy water to get a nuclear reactor running. The manifest clearly indicated that there was only half a ton of heavy water being transported to Germany. &quot;Hydro&quot; was carrying far too little heavy water for one reactor, let alone the 10 or more tons needed to make enough plutonium for a nuclear weapon. The German nuclear weapons program was much less advanced than the Manhattan Project, and no reactor constructed in Nazi Germany came close to reaching criticality. No amount of heavy water would have changed that.

Israel admitted running the Dimona reactor with Norwegian heavy water sold to it in 1959. Through re-export using Romania and Germany, India probably also used Norwegian heavy water.

===Canada===
As part of its contribution to the Manhattan Project, Canada built and operated a per month (design capacity) electrolytic heavy water plant at Trail, British Columbia, which started operation in 1943.

The Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) design of power reactor requires large quantities of heavy water to act as a neutron moderator and coolant. AECL ordered two heavy water plants, which were built and operated in Atlantic Canada at Glace Bay, Nova Scotia (by Deuterium of Canada Limited) and Point Tupper, Richmond County, Nova Scotia (by Canadian General Electric). These plants proved to have significant design, construction and production problems. The Glace Bay plant reached full production in 1984 after being taken over by AECL in 1971. The Point Tupper plant reached full production in 1974 and AECL purchased the plant in 1975. Design changes from the Point Tupper plant were carried through as AECL built the Bruce Heavy Water Plant (), which it later sold to Ontario Hydro, to ensure a reliable supply of heavy water for future power plants. The two Nova Scotia plants were shut down in 1985 when their production proved unnecessary.

The Bruce Heavy Water Plant (BHWP) in Ontario was the world&#x27;s largest heavy water production plant with a capacity of 1600 tonnes per year at its peak (800 tonnes per year per full plant, two fully operational plants at its peak). It used the Girdler sulfide process to produce heavy water, and required 340,000 tonnes of feed water to produce one tonne of heavy water. It was part of a complex that included eight CANDU reactors, which provided heat and power for the heavy water plant. The site was located at Douglas Point/Bruce Nuclear Generating Station near Tiverton, Ontario, on Lake Huron where it had access to the waters of the Great Lakes.

AECL issued the construction contract in 1969 for the first BHWP unit (BHWP A). Commissioning of BHWP A was done by Ontario Hydro from 1971 through 1973, with the plant entering service on 28 June 1973, and design production capacity being achieved in April 1974. Due to the success of BHWP A and the large amount of heavy water that would be required for the large numbers of upcoming planned CANDU nuclear power plant construction projects, Ontario Hydro commissioned three additional heavy water production plants for the Bruce site (BHWP B, C, and D). BHWP B was placed into service in 1979. These first two plants were significantly more efficient than planned, and the number of CANDU construction projects ended up being significantly lower than originally planned, which led to the cancellation of construction on BHWP C &amp; D. In 1984, BHWP A was shut down. By 1993 Ontario Hydro had produced enough heavy water to meet all of its anticipated domestic needs (which were lower than expected due to improved efficiency in the use and recycling of heavy water), so they shut down and demolished half of the capacity of BHWP B. The remaining capacity continued to operate in order to fulfil demand for heavy water exports until it was permanently shut down in 1997, after which the plant was gradually dismantled and the site cleared.

AECL is currently researching other more efficient and environmentally benign processes for creating heavy water. This is relevant for CANDU reactors since heavy water represented about 15–20% of the total capital cost of each CANDU plant in the 1970s and 1980s.

===Iran===
Since 1996 a plant for production of heavy water was being constructed at Khondab near Arak. On 26 August 2006, Iranian President Ahmadinejad inaugurated the expansion of the country&#x27;s heavy-water plant. Iran has indicated that the heavy-water production facility will operate in tandem with a 40 MW research reactor that had a scheduled completion date in 2009. Iran produced deuterated solvents in early 2011 for the first time. The core of the IR-40 is supposed to be re-designed based on the nuclear agreement in July 2015.

Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran is permitted to store only of heavy water. Iran exports excess production, making Iran the world&#x27;s third largest exporter of heavy water. In 2023, Iran sells heavy water; customers have proposed a price over 1,000 dollars per liter.

===Pakistan===

In Pakistan, there are two heavy water production sites that are based in Punjab. Commissioned in 1995–96, the Khushab Nuclear Complex is a central element of Pakistan&#x27;s stockpile program for production of weapon-grade plutonium, deuterium, and tritium for advanced compact warheads (i.e. thermonuclear weapons). Another heavy water facility for producing the heavy water is located in Multan, that it sells to nuclear power plants in Karachi and Chashma.

In early 1980s, Pakistan succeeded in acquiring a tritium purification and storage plant and deuterium and tritium precursor materials from two former East German firms. Unlike India and Iran, the heavy water produced by Pakistan is not exported nor available for purchase to any nation and is solely used for its weapons complex and energy generation at its local nuclear power plants.

===Other countries===
Romania produced heavy water at the now-decommissioned Drobeta Girdler sulfide plant for domestic and export purposes. France operated a small plant during the 1950s and 1960s.

==Applications==
===Nuclear magnetic resonance===
Deuterium oxide is used in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy when using water as a solvent if the nuclide of interest is hydrogen. This is because the signal from light-water (HO) solvent molecules would overwhelm the signal from the molecule of interest dissolved in it. Deuterium has a different magnetic moment and therefore does not contribute to the H-NMR signal at the hydrogen-1 resonance frequency.

For some experiments, it may be desirable to identify the labile hydrogens on a compound, that is hydrogens that can easily exchange away as H ions on some positions in a molecule. With addition of DO, sometimes referred to as a &quot;DO shake&quot;, labile hydrogens exchange between the compound of interest and the solvent, leading to replacement of those specific H atoms in the compound with H. These positions in the molecule then do not appear in the H-NMR spectrum.

===Organic chemistry===
Deuterium oxide is often used as the source of deuterium for preparing specifically labelled isotopologues of organic compounds. For example, C-H bonds adjacent to ketonic carbonyl groups can be replaced by C-D bonds, using acid or base catalysis. Trimethylsulfoxonium iodide, made from dimethyl sulfoxide and methyl iodide can be recrystallized from deuterium oxide, and then dissociated to regenerate methyl iodide and dimethyl sulfoxide, both deuterium labelled. In cases where specific double labelling by deuterium and tritium is contemplated, the researcher must be aware that deuterium oxide, depending upon age and origin, can contain some tritium.

===Infrared spectroscopy===
Deuterium oxide is often used instead of water when collecting FTIR spectra of proteins in solution. HO creates a strong band that overlaps with the amide I region of proteins. The band from DO is shifted away from the amide I region.

===Neutron moderator===
Heavy water is used in certain types of nuclear reactors, where it acts as a neutron moderator to slow down neutrons so that they are more likely to react with the fissile uranium-235 than with uranium-238, which captures neutrons without fissioning.
The CANDU reactor uses this design. Light water also acts as a moderator, but because light water absorbs more neutrons than heavy water, reactors using light water for a reactor moderator must use enriched uranium rather than natural uranium, otherwise criticality is impossible. A significant fraction of outdated power reactors, such as the RBMK reactors in the USSR, were constructed using normal water for cooling but graphite as a moderator. However, the danger of graphite in power reactors (graphite fires in part led to the Chernobyl disaster) has led to the discontinuation of graphite in standard reactor designs.

The breeding and extraction of plutonium can be a relatively rapid and cheap route to building a nuclear weapon, as chemical separation of plutonium from fuel is easier than isotopic separation of U-235 from natural uranium.
Among current and past nuclear weapons states, Israel, India, and North Korea first used plutonium from heavy water moderated reactors burning natural uranium, while China, South Africa and Pakistan first built weapons using highly enriched uranium.

The Nazi nuclear program, operating with more modest means than the contemporary Manhattan Project and hampered by many leading scientists having been driven into exile (many of them ending up working for the Manhattan Project), as well as continuous infighting, wrongly dismissed graphite as a moderator due to not recognizing the effect of impurities. Given that isotope separation of uranium was deemed too big a hurdle, this left heavy water as a potential moderator. Other problems were the ideological aversion regarding what propaganda dismissed as &quot;Jewish physics&quot; and the mistrust between those who had been enthusiastic Nazis even before 1933 and those who were &quot;Mitläufer&quot; or trying to keep a low profile. In part due to allied sabotage and commando raids on Norsk Hydro (then the world&#x27;s largest producer of heavy water) as well as the aforementioned infighting, the German nuclear program never managed to assemble enough uranium and heavy water in one place to achieve criticality despite possessing enough of both by the end of the war.

In the U.S., however, the first experimental atomic reactor (1942), as well as the Manhattan Project Hanford production reactors that produced the plutonium for the Trinity test and Fat Man bombs, all used pure carbon (graphite) neutron moderators combined with normal water cooling pipes. They functioned with neither enriched uranium nor heavy water. Russian and British plutonium production also used graphite-moderated reactors.

There is no evidence that civilian heavy water power reactors—such as the CANDU or Atucha designs—have been used to produce military fissile materials. In nations that do not already possess nuclear weapons, nuclear material at these facilities is under IAEA safeguards to discourage any diversion.

Due to its potential for use in nuclear weapons programs, the possession or import/export of large industrial quantities of heavy water are subject to government control in several countries. Suppliers of heavy water and heavy water production technology typically apply IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) administered safeguards and material accounting to heavy water. (In Australia, the &quot;Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987&quot;.) In the U.S. and Canada, non-industrial quantities of heavy water (i.e., in the gram to kg range) are routinely available without special license through chemical supply dealers and commercial companies such as the world&#x27;s former major producer Ontario Hydro.

===Neutrino detector===
The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) in Sudbury, Ontario uses 1,000 tonnes of heavy water on loan from Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. The neutrino detector is underground in a mine, to shield it from muons produced by cosmic rays. SNO was built to answer the question of whether or not electron-type neutrinos produced by fusion in the Sun (the only type the Sun should be producing directly, according to theory) might be able to turn into other types of neutrinos on the way to Earth. SNO detects the Cherenkov radiation in the water from high-energy electrons produced from electron-type neutrinos as they undergo charged current (CC) interactions with neutrons in deuterium, turning them into protons and electrons (however, only the electrons are fast enough to produce Cherenkov radiation for detection).

SNO also detects neutrino electron scattering (ES) events, where the neutrino transfers energy to the electron, which then proceeds to generate Cherenkov radiation distinguishable from that produced by CC events. The first of these two reactions is produced only by electron-type neutrinos, while the second can be caused by all of the neutrino flavors. The use of deuterium is critical to the SNO function, because all three &quot;flavours&quot; (types) of neutrinos may be detected in a third type of reaction as well, neutrino-disintegration, in which a neutrino of any type (electron, muon, or tau) scatters from a deuterium nucleus (deuteron), transferring enough energy to break up the loosely bound deuteron into a free neutron and proton via a neutral current (NC) interaction.

This event is detected when the free neutron is absorbed by 35Cl− present from NaCl deliberately dissolved in the heavy water, causing emission of characteristic capture gamma rays. Thus, in this experiment, heavy water not only provides the transparent medium necessary to produce and visualize Cherenkov radiation, but it also provides deuterium to detect exotic mu type (μ) and tau (τ) neutrinos, as well as a non-absorbent moderator medium to preserve free neutrons from this reaction, until they can be absorbed by an easily detected neutron-activated isotope.

===Metabolic rate and water turnover testing in physiology and biology===

Heavy water is employed as part of a mixture with HO for a common and safe test of mean metabolic rate in humans and animals undergoing their normal activities.The elimination rate of deuterium alone is a measure of body water turnover. This is highly variable between individuals and depends on environmental conditions as well as subject size, sex, age and physical activity.

===Tritium production===

Tritium is the active substance in self-powered lighting and controlled nuclear fusion, its other uses including autoradiography and radioactive labeling. It is also used in nuclear weapon design for boosted fission weapons and initiators. Tritium undergoes beta decay into helium-3, which is a stable, but rare, isotope of helium that is itself highly sought after. Some tritium is created in heavy water moderated reactors when deuterium captures a neutron. This reaction has a small cross-section (probability of a single neutron-capture event) and produces only small amounts of tritium, although enough to justify cleaning tritium from the moderator every few years to reduce the environmental risk of tritium escape. Given that helium-3 is a neutron poison with orders of magnitude higher capture cross section than any component of heavy or tritiated water, its accumulation in a heavy water neutron moderator or target for tritium production must be kept to a minimum.

Producing a lot of tritium in this way would require reactors with very high neutron fluxes, or with a very high proportion of heavy water to nuclear fuel and very low neutron absorption by other reactor material. The tritium would then have to be recovered by isotope separation from a much larger quantity of deuterium, unlike production from lithium-6 (the present method), where only chemical separation is needed.

Deuterium&#x27;s absorption cross section for thermal neutrons is 0.52 millibarn (5.2 × 10 m; 1 barn = 10 m), while those of oxygen-16 and oxygen-17 are 0.19 and 0.24 millibarn, respectively. O makes up 0.038% of natural oxygen, making the overall cross section 0.28 millibarns. Therefore, in DO with natural oxygen, 21% of neutron captures are on oxygen, rising higher as O builds up from neutron capture on O. Also, O may emit an alpha particle on neutron capture, producing radioactive carbon-14.

<text>The history of science and technology (HST) is a field of history that examines the development of the understanding of the natural world (science) and humans&#x27; ability to manipulate it (technology) at different points in time. This academic discipline also examines the cultural, economic, and political context and impacts of scientific practices; it likewise may study the consequences of new technologies on existing scientific fields.

==Academic study of history of science==

History of science is an academic discipline with an international community of specialists. Main professional organizations for this field include the History of Science Society, the British Society for the History of Science, and the European Society for the History of Science.

Much of the study of the history of science has been devoted to answering questions about what science &quot;is&quot;, how it &quot;functions&quot;, and whether it exhibits large-scale patterns and trends.

=== History of the academic study of history of science ===
Histories of science were originally written by practicing and retired scientists, starting primarily with William Whewell&#x27;s &quot;History of the Inductive Sciences&quot; (1837), as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public.

Auguste Comte proposed that there should be a specific discipline to deal with the history of science.

The development of the distinct academic discipline of the history of science and technology did not occur until the early 20th century. Historians have suggested that this was bound to the changing role of science during the same time period.

After World War I, extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline, with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both Science and Technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world.

In the decades since the end of World War II, history of science became an academic discipline, with graduate schools, research institutes, public and private patronage, peer-reviewed journals, and professional societies.

==== Formation of academic departments ====
In the United States, a more formal study of the history of science as an independent discipline was initiated by George Sarton&#x27;s publications, &quot;Introduction to the History of Science&quot; (1927) and the journal &quot;Isis&quot; (founded in 1912). Sarton exemplified the early 20th-century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress.

The study of the history of science continued to be a small effort until the rise of Big Science after World War II. With the work of I. Bernard Cohen at Harvard University, the history of science began to become an established subdiscipline of history in the United States.

In the United States, the influential bureaucrat Vannevar Bush, and the president of Harvard, James Conant, both encouraged the study of the history of science as a way of improving general knowledge about how science worked, and why it was essential to maintain a large scientific workforce.

Academic study of the history of science as an independent discipline was launched by George Sarton at Harvard with his book &quot;Introduction to the History of Science&quot; (1927) and the &quot;Isis&quot; journal (founded in 1912). Sarton exemplified the early 20th century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The History of Science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested Scientists and Physicians rather than professional Historians. With the work of I. Bernard Cohen at Harvard, the history of Science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945.

<doc id="14286" wikidata="Q911473" url="?curid=14286" title="Holographic principle">
<text>The holographic principle is a property of string theories and a supposed property of quantum gravity that states that the description of a volume of space can be thought of as encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary to the region – such as a light-like boundary like a gravitational horizon. First proposed by Gerard &#x27;t Hooft, it was given a precise string theoretic interpretation by Leonard Susskind, who combined his ideas with previous ones of &#x27;t Hooft and Charles Thorn. Susskind said, &quot;The three-dimensional world of ordinary experience—the universe filled with galaxies, stars, planets, houses, boulders, and people—is a hologram, an image of reality coded on a distant two-dimensional surface.&quot; As pointed out by Raphael Bousso, Thorn observed in 1978, that string theory admits a lower-dimensional description in which gravity emerges from it in what would now be called a holographic way. The prime example of holography is the AdS/CFT correspondence.

The holographic principle was inspired by the Bekenstein bound of black hole thermodynamics, which conjectures that the maximum entropy in any region scales with the radius , rather than cubed as might be expected. In the case of a black hole, the insight was that the information content of all the objects that have fallen into the hole might be entirely contained in surface fluctuations of the event horizon. The holographic principle resolves the black hole information paradox within the framework of string theory. However, there exist classical solutions to the Einstein equations that allow values of the entropy larger than those allowed by an area law (radius squared), hence in principle larger than those of a black hole. These are the so-called &quot;Wheeler&#x27;s bags of gold&quot;. The existence of such solutions conflicts with the holographic interpretation, and their effects in a quantum theory of gravity including the holographic principle are not yet fully understood.

==High-level summary==

The physical universe is widely seen to be composed of &quot;matter&quot; and &quot;energy&quot;. In his 2003 article published in Scientific American magazine, Jacob Bekenstein speculatively summarized a current trend started by John Archibald Wheeler, which suggests scientists may &quot;regard the physical world as made of information, with energy and matter as incidentals&quot;. Bekenstein asks &quot;Could we, as William Blake memorably penned, &#x27;see a world in a grain of sand&#x27;, or is that idea no more than &#x27;poetic license&#x27;?&quot;, referring to the holographic principle.

===Unexpected connection===

Bekenstein&#x27;s topical overview &quot;A Tale of Two Entropies&quot; describes potentially profound implications of Wheeler&#x27;s trend, in part by noting a previously unexpected connection between the world of information theory and classical physics. This connection was first described shortly after the seminal 1948 papers of American applied mathematician Claude Shannon introduced today&#x27;s most widely used measure of information content, now known as Shannon entropy. As an objective measure of the quantity of information, Shannon entropy has been enormously useful, as the design of all modern communications and data storage devices, from cellular phones to modems to hard disk drives and DVDs, rely on Shannon entropy.

In thermodynamics (the branch of physics dealing with heat), entropy is popularly described as a measure of the &quot;disorder&quot; in a physical system of matter and energy. In 1877, Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann described it more precisely in terms of the number of distinct microscopic states that the particles composing a macroscopic &quot;chunk&quot; of matter could be in, while still &quot;looking&quot; like the same macroscopic &quot;chunk&quot;. As an example, for the air in a room, its thermodynamic entropy would equal the logarithm of the count of all the ways that the individual gas molecules could be distributed in the room, and all the ways they could be moving.

===Energy, matter, and information equivalence===

Shannon&#x27;s efforts to find a way to quantify the information contained in, for example, a telegraph message, led him unexpectedly to a formula with the same form as Boltzmann&#x27;s. In an article in the August 2003 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot; titled &quot;Information in the Holographic Universe&quot;, Bekenstein summarizes that &quot;Thermodynamic entropy and Shannon entropy are conceptually equivalent: the number of arrangements that are counted by Boltzmann entropy reflects the amount of Shannon information one would need to implement any particular arrangement&quot; of matter and energy. The only salient difference between the thermodynamic entropy of physics and Shannon&#x27;s entropy of information is in the units of measure; the former is expressed in units of energy divided by temperature, the latter in essentially dimensionless &quot;bits&quot; of information.

The holographic principle states that the entropy of ordinary mass (not just black holes) is also proportional to surface area and not volume; that volume itself is illusory and the universe is really a hologram which is isomorphic to the information &quot;inscribed&quot; on the surface of its boundary.

==The AdS/CFT correspondence==

The anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence, sometimes called Maldacena duality (after ref.) or gauge/gravity duality, is a conjectured relationship between two kinds of physical theories. On one side are anti-de Sitter spaces (AdS) which are used in theories of quantum gravity, formulated in terms of string theory or M-theory. On the other side of the correspondence are conformal field theories (CFT) which are quantum field theories, including theories similar to the Yang–Mills theories that describe elementary particles.

The duality represents a major advance in understanding of string theory and quantum gravity. This is because it provides a non-perturbative formulation of string theory with certain boundary conditions and because it is the most successful realization of the holographic principle.

It also provides a powerful toolkit for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories. Much of the usefulness of the duality results from a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable. This fact has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.

The AdS/CFT correspondence was first proposed by Juan Maldacena in late 1997. Important aspects of the correspondence were elaborated in articles by Steven Gubser, Igor Klebanov, and Alexander Markovich Polyakov, and by Edward Witten. By 2015, Maldacena&#x27;s article had over 10,000 citations, becoming the most highly cited article in the field of high energy physics.

==Black hole entropy==

An object with relatively high entropy is microscopically random, like a hot gas. A known configuration of classical fields has zero entropy: there is nothing random about electric and magnetic fields, or gravitational waves. Since black holes are exact solutions of Einstein&#x27;s equations, they were thought not to have any entropy.

But Jacob Bekenstein noted that this leads to a violation of the second law of thermodynamics. If one throws a hot gas with entropy into a black hole, once it crosses the event horizon, the entropy would disappear. The random properties of the gas would no longer be seen once the black hole had absorbed the gas and settled down. One way of salvaging the second law is if black holes are in fact random objects with an entropy that increases by an amount greater than the entropy of the consumed gas.

Given a fixed volume, a black hole whose event horizon encompasses that volume should be the object with the highest amount of entropy. Otherwise, imagine something with a larger entropy, then by throwing more mass into that something, we obtain a black hole with less entropy, violating the second law.
In a sphere of radius &quot;R&quot;, the entropy in a relativistic gas increases as the energy increases. The only known limit is gravitational; when there is too much energy, the gas collapses into a black hole. Bekenstein used this to put an upper bound on the entropy in a region of space, and the bound was proportional to the area of the region. He concluded that the black hole entropy is directly proportional to the area of the event horizon. Gravitational time dilation causes time, from the perspective of a remote observer, to stop at the event horizon. Due to the natural limit on maximum speed of motion, this prevents falling objects from crossing the event horizon no matter how close they get to it. Since any change in quantum state requires time to flow, all objects and their quantum information state stay imprinted on the event horizon. Bekenstein concluded that from the perspective of any remote observer, the black hole entropy is directly proportional to the area of the event horizon.

Stephen Hawking had shown earlier that the total horizon area of a collection of black holes always increases with time. The horizon is a boundary defined by light-like geodesics; it is those light rays that are just barely unable to escape. If neighboring geodesics start moving toward each other they eventually collide, at which point their extension is inside the black hole. So the geodesics are always moving apart, and the number of geodesics which generate the boundary, the area of the horizon, always increases. Hawking&#x27;s result was called the second law of black hole thermodynamics, by analogy with the law of entropy increase.

At first, Hawking did not take the analogy too seriously. He argued that the black hole must have zero temperature, since black holes do not radiate and therefore cannot be in thermal equilibrium with any black body of positive temperature. Then he discovered that black holes do radiate. When heat is added to a thermal system, the change in entropy is the increase in mass–energy divided by temperature:
::formula_1
(Here the term &quot;δM c2&quot; is substituted for the thermal energy added to the system, generally by non-integrable random processes, in contrast to d&quot;S&quot;, which is a function of a few &quot;state variables&quot; only, i.e. in conventional thermodynamics only of the Kelvin temperature &quot;T&quot; and a few additional state variables, such as the pressure.)

If black holes have a finite entropy, they should also have a finite temperature. In particular, they would come to equilibrium with a thermal gas of photons. This means that black holes would not only absorb photons, but they would also have to emit them in the right amount to maintain detailed balance.

Time-independent solutions to field equations do not emit radiation, because a time-independent background conserves energy. Based on this principle, Hawking set out to show that black holes do not radiate. But, to his surprise, a careful analysis convinced him that they do, and in just the right way to come to equilibrium with a gas at a finite temperature. Hawking&#x27;s calculation fixed the constant of proportionality at 1/4; the entropy of a black hole is one quarter its horizon area in Planck units.

The entropy is proportional to the logarithm of the number of microstates, the enumerated ways a system can be configured microscopically while leaving the macroscopic description unchanged. Black hole entropy is deeply puzzling – it says that the logarithm of the number of states of a black hole is proportional to the area of the horizon, not the volume in the interior.

Later, Raphael Bousso came up with a covariant version of the bound based upon null sheets.

==Black hole information paradox==
{{Main|Black hole information paradox}}
Hawking&#x27;s calculation suggested that the radiation which black holes emit is not related in any way to the matter that they absorb. The outgoing light rays start exactly at the edge of the black hole and spend a long time near the horizon, while the infalling matter only reaches the horizon much later. The infalling and outgoing mass/energy interact only when they cross. It is implausible that the outgoing state would be completely determined by some tiny residual scattering.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Hawking interpreted this to mean that when black holes absorb some photons in a pure state described by a wave function, they re-emit new photons in a thermal mixed state described by a density matrix. This would mean that quantum mechanics would have to be modified because, in quantum mechanics, states which are superpositions with probability amplitudes never become states which are probabilistic mixtures of different possibilities.

Troubled by this paradox, Gerard &#x27;t Hooft analyzed the emission of Hawking radiation in more detail.{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} He noted that when Hawking radiation escapes, there is a way in which incoming particles can modify the outgoing particles. Their gravitational field would deform the horizon of the black hole, and the deformed horizon could produce different outgoing particles than the undeformed horizon. When a particle falls into a black hole, it is boosted relative to an outside observer, and its gravitational field assumes a universal form. &#x27;t Hooft showed that this field makes a logarithmic tent-pole shaped bump on the horizon of a black hole, and like a shadow, the bump is an alternative description of the particle&#x27;s location and mass. For a four-dimensional spherical uncharged black hole, the deformation of the horizon is similar to the type of deformation which describes the emission and absorption of particles on a string-theory world sheet. Since the deformations on the surface are the only imprint of the incoming particle, and since these deformations would have to completely determine the outgoing particles, &#x27;t Hooft believed that the correct description of the black hole would be by some form of string theory.

This idea was made more precise by Leonard Susskind, who had also been developing holography, largely independently. Susskind argued that the oscillation of the horizon of a black hole is a complete description{{refn|&quot;Complete description&quot; means all the &quot;primary&quot; qualities. For example, John Locke (and before him Robert Boyle) determined these to be &quot;size, shape, motion, number, &quot;and&quot; solidity&quot;. Such &quot;secondary quality&quot; information as &quot;color, aroma, taste &quot;and&quot; sound&quot;, or internal quantum state is not information that is implied to be preserved in the surface fluctuations of the event horizon. (See however &quot;path integral quantization&quot;)|group=note}} of both the infalling and outgoing matter, because the world-sheet theory of string theory was just such a holographic description. While short strings have zero entropy, he could identify long highly excited string states with ordinary black holes. This was a deep advance because it revealed that strings have a classical interpretation in terms of black holes.

This work showed that the black hole information paradox is resolved when quantum gravity is described in an unusual string-theoretic way assuming the string-theoretical description is complete, unambiguous and non-redundant. The space-time in quantum gravity would emerge as an effective description of the theory of oscillations of a lower-dimensional black-hole horizon, and suggest that any black hole with appropriate properties, not just strings, would serve as a basis for a description of string theory.

In 1995, Susskind, along with collaborators Tom Banks, Willy Fischler, and Stephen Shenker, presented a formulation of the new M-theory using a holographic description in terms of charged point black holes, the D0 branes of type IIA string theory. The matrix theory they proposed was first suggested as a description of two branes in eleven-dimensional supergravity by Bernard de Wit, Jens Hoppe, and Hermann Nicolai. The later authors reinterpreted the same matrix models as a description of the dynamics of point black holes in particular limits. Holography allowed them to conclude that the dynamics of these black holes give a complete non-perturbative formulation of M-theory. In 1997, Juan Maldacena gave the first holographic descriptions of a higher-dimensional object, the 3+1-dimensional type IIB membrane, which resolved a long-standing problem of finding a string description which describes a gauge theory. These developments simultaneously explained how string theory is related to some forms of supersymmetric quantum field theories.

==Limit on information density==

Information content is defined as the logarithm of the reciprocal of the probability that a system is in a specific microstate, and the information entropy of a system is the expected value of the system&#x27;s information content. This definition of entropy is equivalent to the standard Gibbs entropy used in classical physics. Applying this definition to a physical system leads to the conclusion that, for a given energy in a given volume, there is an upper limit to the density of information (the Bekenstein bound) about the whereabouts of all the particles which compose matter in that volume. In particular, a given volume has an upper limit of information it can contain, at which it will collapse into a black hole.

This suggests that matter itself cannot be subdivided infinitely many times and there must be an ultimate level of fundamental particles. As the degrees of freedom of a particle are the product of all the degrees of freedom of its sub-particles, were a particle to have infinite subdivisions into lower-level particles, the degrees of freedom of the original particle would be infinite, violating the maximal limit of entropy density. The holographic principle thus implies that the subdivisions must stop at some level.

The most rigorous realization of the holographic principle is the AdS/CFT correspondence by Juan Maldacena. However, J. David Brown and Marc Henneaux had rigorously proved in 1986, that the asymptotic symmetry of 2+1 dimensional gravity gives rise to a Virasoro algebra, whose corresponding quantum theory is a 2-dimensional conformal field theory.

==Experimental tests==

The Fermilab physicist Craig Hogan claims that the holographic principle would imply quantum fluctuations in spatial position that would lead to apparent background noise or &quot;holographic noise&quot; measurable at gravitational wave detectors, in particular GEO 600. However these claims have not been widely accepted, or cited, among quantum gravity researchers and appear to be in direct conflict with string theory calculations.

Analyses in 2011 of measurements of gamma ray burst GRB 041219A in 2004 by the INTEGRAL space observatory launched in 2002 by the European Space Agency, shows that Craig Hogan&#x27;s noise is absent down to a scale of 10−48 meters, as opposed to the scale of 10−35 meters predicted by Hogan, and the scale of 10−16 meters found in measurements of the GEO 600 instrument. Research continued at Fermilab under Hogan as of 2013.

Jacob Bekenstein claimed to have found a way to test the holographic principle with a tabletop photon experiment.

<text>Hamilton is a port city in the Canadian province of Ontario. Hamilton has a population of 569,353 (2021), and its census metropolitan area, which encompasses Burlington and Grimsby, has a population of 785,184. The city is situated approximately southwest of Toronto in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA).

Conceived by George Hamilton when he purchased the Durand farm shortly after the War of 1812, the town of Hamilton became the centre of a densely populated and industrialized region at the west end of Lake Ontario known as the Golden Horseshoe. On January 1, 2001, the current boundaries of Hamilton were created through the amalgamation of the original city with other municipalities of the Regional Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth. Residents of the city are known as Hamiltonians.

Traditionally, the local economy has been led by the steel and heavy manufacturing industries. During the 2010s, a shift toward the service sector occurred, such as health and sciences. Hamilton is home to the Royal Botanical Gardens, the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum, the Bruce Trail, McMaster University, Mohawk College, and Redeemer University. McMaster University is ranked 4th in Canada and 69th in the world by Times Higher Education Rankings 2021.

==History==

In pre-colonial times, the Neutral First Nation used much of the land. They were gradually driven out by the Five (later Six) Nations (Iroquois) who were allied with the British against the Huron and their French allies. The hamlet of Westover was built in an area that was originally a Seneca Iroquois tribal village, Tinawatawa, which was first visited by the French in September 1699.

After the American Revolutionary War, about 10,000 United Empire Loyalists left the United States to settle in Upper Canada, now southern Ontario. In 1792, the Crown purchased the land on which Hamilton now stands from the Mississaugas in Treaty 3, also known as the Between the Lakes Purchase. The Crown granted the Loyalists lands from this purchase to encourage settlement in the region. These new settlers were soon followed by many more Americans, attracted by the availability of inexpensive, arable land. At the same time, large numbers of Iroquois who had allied with Britain arrived from the United States and were settled on reserves west of Lake Ontario as compensation for lands they lost in what was now the United States. During the War of 1812, British regulars and local militia defeated invading American troops at the Battle of Stoney Creek, fought in what is now a park in eastern Hamilton.

The town of Hamilton was conceived by George Hamilton (a son of a Queenston entrepreneur and founder, Robert Hamilton), when he purchased farm holdings of James Durand, the local member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada, shortly after the War of 1812. Nathaniel Hughson, a property owner to the north, cooperated with George Hamilton to prepare a proposal for a courthouse and jail on Hamilton&#x27;s property. Hamilton offered the land to the crown for the future site. Durand was empowered by Hughson and Hamilton to sell property holdings which later became the site of the town. As he had been instructed, Durand circulated the offers at York during a session of the Legislative Assembly, which established a new Gore District, of which the Hamilton townsite was a member.

Initially, this town was not the most important centre of the Gore District. An early indication of Hamilton&#x27;s sudden prosperity occurred in 1816 when it was chosen over Ancaster, Ontario to be the new Gore District&#x27;s administrative centre. Another dramatic economic turnabout for Hamilton occurred in 1832 when a canal was finally cut through the outer sand bar that enabled Hamilton to become a major port. A permanent jail was not constructed until 1832, when a cut-stone design was completed on Prince&#x27;s Square, one of the two squares created in 1816. Subsequently, the first police board and the town limits were defined by statute on February 13, 1833. Official city status was achieved on June 9, 1846, by an act of Parliament of the Province of Canada.

By 1845, the population was 6,475. In 1846, there were useful roads to many communities as well as stagecoaches and steamboats to Toronto, Queenston, and Niagara. Eleven cargo schooners were owned in Hamilton. Eleven churches were in operation. A reading room provided access to newspapers from other cities and from England and the U.S. In addition to stores of all types, four banks, tradesmen of various types, and sixty-five taverns, industry in the community included three breweries, ten importers of dry goods and groceries, five importers of hardware, two tanneries, three coachmakers, and a marble and a stone works.
As the city grew, several prominent buildings were constructed in the late 19th century, including the Grand Lodge of Canada in 1855, West Flamboro Methodist Church in 1879 (later purchased by Dufferin Masonic Lodge in 1893), a public library in 1890, and the Right House department store in 1893. The first commercial telephone service in Canada, the first telephone exchange in the British Empire, and the second telephone exchange in all of North America were each established in the city between 1877 and 1878. The city had several interurban electric street railways and two inclines, all powered by the Cataract Power Co.

Though suffering through the Hamilton Street Railway strike of 1906, with industrial businesses expanding, Hamilton&#x27;s population doubled between 1900 and 1914. Two steel manufacturing companies, Stelco and Dofasco, were formed in 1910 and 1912, respectively. Procter &amp; Gamble and the Beech-Nut Packing Company opened manufacturing plants in 1914 and 1922, respectively, their first outside the US. In June and July 1916, the a strike of up to 2,000 machinists was caused by a failure of employers to improve working conditions or pay during a booming World War I economy. The strike disrupted production at many of the largest manufacturers and was the largest dispute in the city&#x27;s history. Population and economic growth continued until the 1960s. In 1929 the city&#x27;s first high-rise building, the Pigott Building, was constructed; in 1930 McMaster University moved from Toronto to Hamilton, in 1934 the second Canadian Tire store in Canada opened here; in 1940 the airport was completed; and in 1948, the Studebaker assembly line was constructed. Infrastructure and retail development continued, with the Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway opening in 1958, and the first Tim Hortons store in 1964.

Since then, many of the large industries have moved or shut down operations in a restructuring that also affected the United States. In 1997, there was a devastating fire at the Plastimet plastics plant. Approximately 300 firefighters battled the blaze, and many sustained severe chemical burns and inhaled volatile organic compounds when at least 400 tonnes of PVC plastic were consumed in the fire.

On January 1, 2001, the new city of Hamilton was formed from the amalgamation of Hamilton and its five neighbouring municipalities: Ancaster, Dundas, Flamborough, Glanbrook, and Stoney Creek. Before amalgamation, the &quot;old&quot; City of Hamilton had 331,121 residents and was divided into 100 neighbourhoods. The former region of Hamilton-Wentworth had a population of 490,268. The amalgamation created a single-tier municipal government ending subsidization of its suburbs. The new amalgamated city had 519,949 people in more than 100 neighbourhoods, and surrounding communities.

The city was impacted by a widespread blackout in 2003 and a tornado in 2005. In 2007, the Red Hill Valley Parkway opened after extensive delays. The Stelco mills were idled in 2010 and permanently closed in 2013. This closure capped a significant shift in the city&#x27;s economy: the percentage of the population employed in manufacturing declined from 22 to 12 percent between 2003 and 2013.

==Geography==

Hamilton is in Southern Ontario on the western end of the Niagara Peninsula and wraps around the westernmost part of Lake Ontario; most of the city, including the downtown section, is on the south shore. Hamilton is in the geographic centre of the Golden Horseshoe. Its major physical features are Hamilton Harbour, marking the northern limit of the city, and the Niagara Escarpment running through the middle of the city across its entire breadth, bisecting the city into &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; parts. The maximum high point is 250m (820&#x27;) above the level of Lake Ontario.

According to all records from local historians, this district was called &quot;Attiwandaronia&quot; by the native Neutral people. Hamilton is one of 11 cities showcased in the book, &quot;Green City: People, Nature &amp; Urban Places&quot; by Quebec author Mary Soderstrom, which examines the city as an example of an industrial powerhouse co-existing with nature. Soderstrom credits Thomas McQuesten and family in the 1930s who &quot;became champions of parks, greenspace and roads&quot; in Hamilton.

Hamilton Harbour is a natural harbour with a large sandbar called the Beachstrip. This sandbar was deposited during a period of higher lake levels during the last ice age and extends southeast through the central lower city to the escarpment. Hamilton&#x27;s deep sea port is accessed by ship canal through the beach strip into the harbour and is traversed by two bridges, the QEW&#x27;s Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway and the lower Canal Lift Bridge.

Between 1788 and 1793, the townships at the Head-of-the-Lake were surveyed and named. The area was first known as The Head-of-the-Lake for its location at the western end of Lake Ontario. John Ryckman, born in Barton township (where present day downtown Hamilton is), described the area in 1803 as he remembered it: &quot;The city in 1803 was all forest. The shores of the bay were difficult to reach or see because they were hidden by a thick, almost impenetrable mass of trees and undergrowth&quot;.

George Hamilton, a settler and local politician, established a town site in the northern portion of Barton Township in 1815. He kept several east–west roads which were originally Indian trails, but the north–south streets were on a regular grid pattern. Streets were designated &quot;East&quot; or &quot;West&quot; if they crossed James Street or Highway 6. Streets were designated &quot;North&quot; or &quot;South&quot; if they crossed King Street or Highway 8. The townsite&#x27;s design, likely conceived in 1816, was commonplace. George Hamilton employed a grid street pattern used in most towns in Upper Canada and throughout the American frontier. The eighty original lots had frontages of fifty feet; each lot faced a broad street and backed onto a twelve-foot lane. It took at least a decade to sell all the original lots, but the construction of the Burlington Canal in 1823, and a new court-house in 1827 encouraged Hamilton to add more blocks around 1828–9. At this time he included a market square in an effort to draw commercial activity onto his lands, but the town&#x27;s natural growth occurred to the north of Hamilton&#x27;s plot.

The Hamilton Conservation Authority owns, leases or manages about of land with the city operating of parkland at 310 locations. Many of the parks are along the Niagara Escarpment, which runs from Tobermory at the tip of the Bruce Peninsula in the north, to Queenston at the Niagara River in the south, and provides views of the cities and towns at Lake Ontario&#x27;s western end. The hiking path Bruce Trail runs the length of the escarpment. Hamilton is home to more than 100 waterfalls and cascades, most of which are on or near the Bruce Trail as it winds through the Niagara Escarpment. Visitors can often be seen swimming in the waterfalls during the summertime, although it is strongly recommended to stay away from the water: much of the watershed of the Chedoke and Red Hill creeks originates in storm sewers running beneath neighbourhoods atop the Niagara escarpment, and water quality in many of Hamilton&#x27;s waterfalls is seriously degraded. High &quot;e. coli&quot; counts are regularly observed through testing by McMaster University near many of Hamilton&#x27;s waterfalls, sometimes exceeding the provincial limits for recreational water use by as much as 400 times. The storm sewers in upstream neighbourhoods carry polluted runoff from streets and parking lots, as well as occasional raw sewage from sanitary lines that were improperly connected to the storm sewers instead of the separate sanitary sewer system. Notably, in March 2020, it was revealed that as much as 24 billion litres of untreated wastewater has been leaking into the Chedoke creek and Cootes&#x27; Paradise areas since at least 2014 due to insufficiencies in the city&#x27;s sewerage and storm water management systems.

===Climate===

Hamilton&#x27;s climate is humid-continental, characterized by changeable weather patterns. In the Köppen classification, Hamilton is on the Dfb/Dfa boundary, found in southern Ontario because the average temperature in July is . However, its climate is moderate compared with most of Canada. The airport&#x27;s open, rural location and higher altitude results in lower temperatures, generally windier conditions, and higher snowfall amounts than lower, built-up areas of the city. The highest temperature ever recorded in Hamilton was 41.1 °C (106 °F) on July 14, 1868. The coldest temperature ever recorded was −30.6 °C (−23 °F) on January 25, 1884. In 2023, it was found that the city has areas of poor air quality with a high concentration of benzo(a)pyrene, particularly in neighbourhoods near industrial sites.

==Economy==


Manufacturing is important to Ontario&#x27;s economy, and the Toronto–Hamilton region is Canada&#x27;s most industrialized area. The area from Oshawa, Ontario around the west end of Lake Ontario to Niagara Falls, with Hamilton at its centre, is known as the Golden Horseshoe and had a population of approximately 8.1 million people in 2006.

With sixty percent of Canada&#x27;s steel produced in Hamilton by Stelco and Dofasco, the city has become known as the Steel Capital of Canada. After nearly declaring bankruptcy, Stelco returned to profitability in 2004. On August 26, 2007 United States Steel Corporation acquired Stelco for C$38.50 in cash per share, owning more than 76 percent of Stelco&#x27;s outstanding shares. On September 17, 2014, US Steel Canada announced it was applying for bankruptcy protection and it would close its Hamilton operations.

A stand-alone subsidiary of ArcelorMittal, the world&#x27;s largest steel producer, Dofasco produces products for the automotive, construction, energy, manufacturing, pipe and tube, appliance, packaging, and steel distribution industries. It has approximately 7,300 employees at its Hamilton plant, and the four million tons of steel it produces each year is about 30% of Canada&#x27;s flat-rolled sheet steel shipments. Dofasco was North America&#x27;s most profitable steel producer in 1999, the most profitable in Canada in 2000, and a long-time member of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. Ordered by the U.S. Department of Justice to divest itself of the Canadian company, ArcelorMittal has been allowed to retain Dofasco provided it sells several of its American assets.

==Demographics==

Same-sex couples (married or in common-law relationships) constitute 0.8% (2,710 individuals) of the partnered population in Hamilton.

Environics Analytics, a geodemographic marketing firm that created 66 different &quot;clusters&quot; of people complete with profiles of how they live, what they think and what they consume, sees a future Hamilton with younger upscale Hamiltonians — who are tech-savvy and university-educated — choosing to live in the downtown and surrounding areas rather than just visiting intermittently. More two and three-storey townhouses and apartments will be built on downtown lots; small condos will be built on vacant spaces in areas such as Dundas, Ainslie Wood and Westdale to accommodate newly retired seniors. Furthermore, additional retail and commercial zones will be created.

=== Ethnicity ===
Hamilton maintains significant Italian, English, Scottish, German and Irish ancestry. 130,705 Hamiltonians claim English heritage, while 98,765 indicate their ancestors arrived from Scotland, 87,825 from Ireland, 62,335 from Italy, and 50,400 from Germany. The top countries of birth for the newcomers living in Hamilton in the 1990s were: former Yugoslavia, Poland, India, China, the Philippines, and Iraq.

Hamilton also has a notable French community for which provincial services are offered in French. In Ontario, urban centres where there are at least 5,000 Francophones are designated areas where bilingual provincial services have to be offered. As per the 2016 census, the Francophone community maintains a population of 6,760, while 30,530 residents, or 5.8% of the city&#x27;s population, have knowledge of both official languages. The Franco-Ontarian community of Hamilton boasts two school boards, the public &quot;Conseil scolaire Viamonde&quot; and the Catholic &quot;Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir&quot;, which operate five schools (2 secondary and 3 elementary). Additionally, the city maintains a Francophone community health centre that is part of the LHIN (Centre de santé communautaire Hamilton/Niagara), a cultural centre (Centre français Hamilton), three daycare centres, a provincially funded employment centre (Options Emploi), a community college site (Collège Boréal) and a community organization that supports the development of the francophone community in Hamilton (ACFO Régionale Hamilton).

The Hamilton Reserve Barracks on Pier Nine houses the naval reserve division , 23 Service Battalion and the 23 Field Ambulance.

===Crime===
The Criminal Code of Canada is the chief piece of legislation defining criminal conduct and penalty. The Hamilton Police Service is chiefly responsible for the enforcement of federal and provincial law. Although the Hamilton Police Service has authority to enforce, bylaws passed by the Hamilton City Council are mainly enforced by Provincial Offences Officers employed by the City of Hamilton.

The Hamilton Film Festival stages an annual program of over 100 independent feature and short films annually, many but not all with direct production connections to the city.

Growth in the arts and culture sector has garnered media attention for Hamilton. A 2006 article in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, entitled &quot;Go West, Young Artist&quot;, focused on Hamilton&#x27;s growing art scene. The Factory: Hamilton Media Arts Centre, opened a new home on James Street North in 2006. Art galleries have sprung up on streets across the city: James Street, King William Street, Locke Street and King Street.

===Sports===

Hamilton hosted Canada&#x27;s first major international athletic event, the first Commonwealth Games (then called the British Empire Games) in 1930. Hamilton bid for the Commonwealth Games in 2010 but lost to New Delhi. On November 7, 2009, in Guadalajara, Mexico, it was announced Toronto would host the 2015 Pan Am Games after beating out two rival South American cities, Lima, Peru, and Bogotá, Colombia. The city of Hamilton co-hosted the Games with Toronto. Hamilton Mayor Fred Eisenberger said &quot;the Pan Am Games will provide a &#x27;unique opportunity for Hamilton to renew major sport facilities giving Hamiltonians a multi-purpose stadium, a 50-metre swimming pool, and an international-calibre velodrome to enjoy for generations to come&#x27;.&quot; Hamilton&#x27;s major sports complexes include Tim Hortons Field and FirstOntario Centre.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

The primary highways serving Hamilton are Highway 403, the QEW, the Lincoln M. Alexander Parkway, and the Red Hill Valley Parkway. Other highways connecting Hamilton include Highway 5, Highway 6 and Highway 8. Public transportation is provided by the Hamilton Street Railway, which operates an extensive local bus system. Hamilton and Metrolinx will build a provincially-funded LRT line (Hamilton LRT) in the early 2020s. 
Intercity public transportation, including frequent service to Toronto, is provided by GO Transit. The Hamilton GO Centre (formerly the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway station), as well as West Harbour GO Station are two commuter rail stations on the Lakeshore West line of GO Transit that serve the city, with the latter having hourly service to Toronto. Regional bus services operated by GO Transit also run to Brantford, Kitchener, and cities along the Ontario Highway 407. Aldershot station in nearby Burlington, is the intercity (Via Rail) station for both Burlington and Hamilton.

In the 1940s, the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport was a wartime air force training station. Today, managed by TradePort International Corporation, passenger traffic at the Hamilton terminal has grown from 90,000 in 1996 to approximately 900,000 in 2002 with mostly domestic and vacation destinations in the United States, Mexico and Central America. The airport&#x27;s mid-term growth target for its passenger service is five million air travellers annually. The airport&#x27;s air cargo sector has 24–7 operational capability and strategic geographic location, allowing its capacity to increase by 50% since 1996; 91,000 metric tonnes (100,000 tons) of cargo passed through the airport in 2002. Courier companies with operations at the airport include United Parcel Service and Cargojet Canada. In 2003, the city began developing a 30-year growth management strategy which called, in part, for a massive aerotropolis industrial park centred on Hamilton Airport. Advocates of the aerotropolis proposal, now known as the &quot;Airport Employment Growth District&quot;, tout it as a solution to the city&#x27;s shortage of employment lands. The closest other international airport to Hamilton is Toronto Pearson International Airport, located northeast of the city in Mississauga.

A report by Hemson Consulting identified an opportunity to develop of greenfields (the size of the Royal Botanical Gardens) that could create an estimated 90,000 jobs by 2031. A proposed aerotropolis industrial park at Highway 6 and 403, has been debated at City Hall for years. Opponents feel the city needs to do more investigation about the cost to taxpayers.

Hamilton also plays a major role in Ontario&#x27;s marine shipping industry as the Port of Hamilton is Ontario&#x27;s busiest port handling between 9 and 12 million tonnes of cargo annually.

<text>The Hussites (Czech: &quot;Husité&quot; or &quot;Kališníci&quot;, &quot;Chalice People&quot;; Latin: &quot;Hussitae&quot;) were a Czech proto-Protestant Christian movement influenced by both the Byzantine Rite and John Wycliffe that followed the teachings of reformer Jan Hus (fl. 1401–1415), a part of the Bohemian Reformation.

The Czech lands had originally been Christianized by Byzantine Greek missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius, who introduced the Byzantine Rite in the Old Church Slavonic liturgical language and the Byzantine tradition of Communion in both kinds administered by the holy spoon. Over the centuries that followed, however, the Roman Rite in Ecclesiastical Latin, which is less easily understood than Slavonic by native speakers of Old Czech, was imposed upon the Czech people despite considerable public resistance, by German-speaking bishops, beginning with Wiching, from the Holy Roman Empire. (See also Sázava Monastery). As a cultural memory of both communion in both kinds and the Divine Liturgy in a language closer to the vernacular is believed to have survived well into the Renaissance, the ideas of Jan Hus and others like him swiftly gained a wide public following. After the trial and execution of Hus at the Council of Constance, a series of crusades, civil wars, victories and compromises between various factions with different theological agendas broke out. At the end of the Hussite Wars (1420–1434), the now Catholic-supported Utraquist side came out victorious from protracted conflict against Jan Žižka and the Taborites, who embraced the more radical theological teachings of John Wycliffe and the Lollards, and became the dominant Hussite group in Bohemia.

Catholics and Utraquists were given legal equality in Bohemia after the religious peace of Kutná Hora in 1485. Bohemia and Moravia, or what is now the territory of the Czech Republic, remained majority Hussite for two centuries. Roman Catholicism was only reimposed by the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II following the 1620 Battle of White Mountain and during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

The Hussite tradition continues in the Moravian Church, Unity of the Brethren and, since the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, by the re-founded Czechoslovak Hussite Church. The revived legacy of Sts Cyril and Methodius also continues in both the Orthodox Church in the Czech Lands and the Apostolic Exarchate of the Greek Catholic Church in the Czech Republic.

== History ==

The Hussite movement began in the Kingdom of Bohemia and quickly spread throughout the remaining Lands of the Bohemian Crown, including Moravia and Silesia. It also made inroads into the northern parts of the Kingdom of Hungary (now Slovakia), but was rejected and gained infamy for the plundering behaviour of the Hussite soldiers. There were also very small temporary communities in Poland-Lithuania and Transylvania which moved to Bohemia after being confronted with religious intolerance. It was a regional movement that failed to expand farther. Hussites emerged as a majority Utraquist movement with a significant Taborite faction, and smaller regional ones that included Adamites, Orebites and Orphans.

Major Hussite theologians included Petr Chelčický, Jerome of Prague. A number of Czech national heroes were Hussite, including Jan Žižka, who led a fierce resistance to five consecutive crusades proclaimed on Hussite Bohemia by the Papacy. Hussites were one of the most important forerunners of the Protestant Reformation. This predominantly religious movement was propelled by social issues and strengthened Czech national awareness.

=== Hus&#x27;s death === 

The Council of Constance lured Jan Hus in with a letter of indemnity, then tried him for heresy and put him to death at the stake on 6 July 1415.

The arrest of Hus in 1414 caused considerable resentment in Czech lands. The authorities of both countries appealed urgently and repeatedly to King Sigismund to release Jan Hus.

When news of his death at the Council of Constance arrived, disturbances broke out, directed primarily against the clergy and especially against the monks. Even the Archbishop narrowly escaped from the effects of this popular anger. The treatment of Hus was felt to be a disgrace inflicted upon the whole country and his death was seen as a criminal act. King Wenceslaus IV., prompted by his grudge against Sigismund, at first gave free vent to his indignation at the course of events in Constance. His wife openly favoured the friends of Hus. Avowed Hussites stood at the head of the government.

A league was formed by certain lords, who pledged themselves to protect the free preaching of the Gospel upon all their possessions and estates and to obey the power of the Bishops only where their orders accorded with the injunctions of the Bible. The university would arbitrate any disputed points. The entire Hussite nobility joined the league. Other than verbal protest of the council&#x27;s treatment of Hus, there was little evidence of any actions taken by the nobility until 1417. At that point several of the lesser nobility and some barons, signatories of the 1415 protest letter, removed Catholic priests from their parishes, replacing them with priests willing to give communion in both wine and bread. The chalice of wine became the central identifying symbol of the Hussite movement. If the king had joined, its resolutions would have received the sanction of the law; but he refused, and approached the newly formed Roman Catholic League of lords, whose members pledged themselves to support the king, the Catholic Church, and the council. The prospect of a civil war began to emerge.

Prior to becoming pope, Martin V, then known as Cardinal Otto of Colonna had attacked Hus with relentless severity. He energetically resumed the battle against Hus&#x27;s teaching after the enactments of the Council of Constance. He wished to eradicate completely the doctrine of Hus, for which purpose the co-operation of King Wenceslaus had to be obtained. In 1418, Sigismund succeeded in winning his brother over to the standpoint of the council by pointing out the inevitability of a religious war if the heretics in Bohemia found further protection. Hussite statesmen and army leaders had to leave the country and Roman Catholic priests were reinstated. These measures caused a general commotion which hastened the death of King Wenceslaus by a paralytic stroke in 1419. His heir was Sigismund.

=== Hussite Wars (1419–1434) ===

The news of the death of King Wenceslaus in 1419 produced a great commotion among the people of Prague. A revolution swept over the country: churches and monasteries were destroyed, and church property was seized by the Hussite nobility. It was then, and remained till much later, in question whether Bohemia was a hereditary or an elective monarchy, especially as the line through which Sigismund claimed the throne had accepted that the Kingdom of Bohemia was an elective monarchy elected by the nobles, and thus the regent of the kingdom (Čeněk of Wartenberg) also explicitly stated that Sigismund had not been elected as reason for Sigismund&#x27;s claim to not be accepted. Sigismund could get possession of &quot;his&quot; kingdom only by force of arms. Pope Martin V called upon Catholics of the West to take up arms against the Hussites, declaring a crusade, and twelve years of warfare followed.

The Hussites initially campaigned defensively, but after 1427 they assumed the offensive. Apart from their religious aims, they fought for the national interests of the Czechs. The moderate and radical parties were united, and they not only repelled the attacks of the army of crusaders but crossed the borders into neighboring countries. On March 23, 1430, Joan of Arc dictated a letter that threatened to lead a crusading army against the Hussites unless they returned to the Catholic faith, but her capture by English and Burgundian troops two months later would keep her from carrying out this threat.

=== Council of Basel and Compacta of Prague ===
Eventually, the opponents of the Hussites found themselves forced to consider an amicable settlement. The Hussites were sent an invitation to attend the ecumenical Council of Basel on October 15, 1431. The discussions began on 10 January 1432, focusing chiefly on the four articles of Prague. No agreement emerged. After repeated negotiations between the Basel Council and Bohemia, a Bohemian–Moravian state assembly in Prague accepted the &quot;Compactata&quot; of Prague on 30 November 1433. The agreement granted communion in both kinds to all who desired it, but with the understanding that Christ was entirely present in each kind, though on the condition that the rest of the Hussite reforms would no longer be emphasised. Free preaching was granted conditionally: the Church hierarchy had to approve and place priests, and the power of the bishop must be considered. The article which prohibited the secular power of the clergy was almost reversed.

The Taborites refused to conform. The Calixtines united with the Roman Catholics and destroyed the Taborites at the Battle of Lipany on 30 May 1434. From that time, the Taborites lost their importance, though the Hussite movement would continue in Poland for another five years, until the Royalist forces of Poland defeated the Polish Hussites at the Battle of Grotniki. The state assembly of Jihlava in 1436 confirmed the &quot;Compactata&quot; and gave them the sanction of law. This accomplished the reconciliation of Bohemia with Rome and the Western Church, and at last Sigismund obtained possession of the Bohemian crown. His reactionary measures caused a ferment in the whole country, but he died in 1437. The state assembly in Prague rejected Wyclif&#x27;s doctrine of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, which was obnoxious to the Utraquists, as heresy in 1444. Most of the Taborites now went over to the party of the Utraquists; the rest joined the &quot;Brothers of the Law of Christ&quot; () (see history of the Moravian Church).

=== Hussite Bohemia, Luther and the Reformation (1434–1618) ===

In 1462, Pope Pius II declared the &quot;Compacta&quot; null and void, prohibited communion in both kinds, and acknowledged King George of Podebrady as king on condition that he would promise an unconditional harmony with the Roman Church. This he refused, leading to the Bohemian–Hungarian War (1468–1478). His successor, King Vladislaus II, favored the Roman Catholics and proceeded against some zealous clergymen of the Calixtines. The troubles of the Utraquists increased from year to year. In 1485, at the Diet of Kutná Hora, an agreement was made between the Roman Catholics and Utraquists that lasted for thirty-one years. It was only later, at the Diet of 1512, that the equal rights of both religions were permanently established. The appearance of Martin Luther was hailed by the Utraquist clergy, and Luther himself was astonished to find so many points of agreement between the doctrines of Hus and his own. But not all Utraquists approved of the German Reformation; a schism arose among them, and many returned to the Roman doctrine, while other elements had organised the &quot;Unitas Fratrum&quot; already in 1457.

=== Bohemian Revolt and harsh persecution under the Habsburgs (1618–1918) ===
Under Emperor Maximilian II, the Bohemian state assembly established the Confessio Bohemica, upon which Lutherans, Reformed, and Bohemian Brethren agreed. From that time forward Hussitism began to die out. After the Battle of White Mountain on 8 November 1620 the Roman Catholic Faith was re-established with vigour, which fundamentally changed the religious conditions of the Czech lands.

Leaders and members of Unitas Fratrum were forced to choose to either leave the many and varied southeastern principalities of what was the Holy Roman Empire (mainly Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, Moravia and parts of Germany and its many states), or to practice their beliefs secretly. As a result, members were forced underground and dispersed across northwestern Europe. The largest remaining communities of the Brethren were located in Lissa (Leszno) in Poland, which had historically strong ties with the Czechs, and in small, isolated groups in Moravia. Some, among them Jan Amos Comenius, fled to western Europe, mainly the Low Countries. A settlement of Hussites in Herrnhut, Saxony, now Germany, in 1722 caused the emergence of the Moravian Church.

=== Post-Habsburg era and modern times (1918–present) ===

In 1918, as a result of World War I, the Czech lands regained independence from Austria-Hungary controlled by the Habsburg monarchy as Czechoslovakia (due to Masaryk and Czechoslovak legions with Hussite tradition, in the name of the troops).

Today, the Hussite tradition is represented in the Moravian Church, Unity of the Brethren, and Czechoslovak Hussite Church.

== Factions ==


Hussitism organised itself during the years 1415–1419. Hussites were not a unitary movement, but a diverse one with multiple factions that held different views and opposed each other in the Hussite Wars. From the beginning, there formed two parties, with a smaller number of people withdrawing from both parties around the pacifist Petr Chelčický, whose teachings would form the foundation of the Unitas Fratrum. Hussites can be divided into:

* Moderate Hussites
** Prague Hussites
** Bohemian Hussite nobility
** Hussites of Žatec and Louny
** Other Utraquists/Calixtines
* Radical Hussites
** Taborites
** Orebites
** Adamites
** Orphans
** Other Radical Hussites

===Moderates ===
The more conservative Hussites (the moderate party, or Utraquists), who followed Hus more closely, sought to conduct reform while leaving the whole hierarchical and liturgical order of the Church untouched.

Their programme is contained in the Four Articles of Prague, which were written by Jacob of Mies and agreed upon in July 1420, promulgated in the Latin, Czech, and German languages. They can be summarised as follows: 

* Free preaching of the Word of God throughout the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Margravate of Moravia.
* Celebration of the communion under both kinds (bread and wine to priests and laity alike)
* The removal of secular power from the clergy.
* Secular punishment for mortal sins among clergy and laity alike.

The views of the moderate Hussites were widely represented at the university and among the citizens of Prague; they were therefore called the Prague Party, but also Calixtines (Latin &quot;calix&quot; chalice) or Utraquists (Latin &quot;utraque&quot; both), because they emphasized the second article of Prague, and the chalice became their emblem.

===Radicals===
The more radical parties, the Taborites, Orebites and Orphans, identified itself more boldly with the doctrines of John Wycliffe, sharing his passionate hatred of the monastic clergy, and his desire to return the Church to its supposed condition during the time of the apostles. This required the removal of the existing hierarchy and the secularisation of ecclesiastical possessions. Above all they clung to Wycliffe&#x27;s doctrine of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, denying transubstantiation, and this is the principal point by which they are distinguished from the moderate party, the Utraquists.

The radicals preached the &quot;sufficientia legis Christi&quot;—the divine law (i.e. the Bible) is the sole rule and canon for human society, not only in the church, but also in political and civil matters. They rejected therefore, as early as 1416, everything that they believed had no basis in the Bible, such as the veneration of saints and images, fasts, superfluous holidays, the oath, intercession for the dead, auricular Confession, indulgences, the sacraments of Confirmation and the Anointing of the Sick, and chose their own priests.

The radicals had their gathering-places all around the country. Their first armed assault fell on the small town of Ústí, on the river Lužnice, south of Prague (today&#x27;s Sezimovo Ústí). However, as the place did not prove to be defensible, they settled in the remains of an older town upon a hill not far away and founded a new town, which they named Tábor (a play on words, as &quot;Tábor&quot; not only meant &quot;camp&quot; or &quot;encampment&quot; in Czech, but is also the traditional name of the mountain on which Jesus was expected to return; see Mark 13); hence they were called Táborité (Taborites). They comprised the essential force of the radical Hussites.

Their aim was to destroy the enemies of the law of God, and to defend his kingdom (which had been expected to come in a short time) by the sword. Their end-of-world visions did not come true. In order to preserve their settlement and spread their ideology, they waged bloody wars; in the beginning they observed a strict regime, inflicting the severest punishment equally for murder, as for less severe faults as adultery, perjury and usury, and also tried to apply rigid Biblical standards to the social order of the time. The Taborites usually had the support of the Orebites (later called Orphans), an eastern Bohemian sect of Hussitism based in Hradec Králové.

<text>Herman of Alaska (; 1756 – November 15, 1837) was a Russian Orthodox monk and missionary to Alaska, which was then part of Russian America. His gentle approach and ascetic life earned him the love and respect of both the native Alaskans and the Russian colonists. He is considered by many Orthodox Christians to be the patron saint of North America.

==Early life==
Biographers disagree about Herman&#x27;s early life. His official biography, which Valaam Monastery published in 1867, said that his pre-monastic name was unknown, but that Herman was born into a merchant&#x27;s family in Serpukhov, a city in Moscow Governorate. He was said to later become a novice at the Trinity-St. Sergius Hermitage near St. Petersburg before going to Valaam to complete his training and receive full tonsure as a monk. But, modern biographer Sergei Korsun found this account to be based on erroneous information provided by Semyon Yanovsky, an administrator from 1818 through part of 1820 of the Russian-American Company (RAC) in Alaska. He confused Herman&#x27;s biographical information with that of another monk, Joseph (Telepnev).

Another former RAC Chief Manager, Ferdinand von Wrangel, stated Herman was originally from a prosperous peasant family in the Voronezh Governorate and served in the military. He then entered monastic life as a novice at Sarov Monastery. This concurred with testimony of Archimandrite Theophan (Sokolov), and a letter written by Herman himself. These agree that Herman began his monastic life as a novice at Sarov, and later received the full tonsure at Valaam. A young military clerk named Egor Ivanovich Popov, from the Voronezh Governorate, was tonsured with the name &#x27;Herman&#x27; at Valaam in 1782.

All biographers agree that at Valaam, Herman studied under Abbot Nazarius, previously of Sarov Monastery. The abbot had been influenced by the hesychastic tradition of Paisius Velichkovsky. Herman undertook various obediences and was well-liked by the brethren, but wanted a more solitary life. He became a hermit with Abbot Nazarius&#x27; blessing. His hermitage, which later became known as &quot;Herman&#x27;s field&quot; or Germanovo, was two kilometers from the monastery. Metropolitan Gabriel of St. Petersburg offered to ordain Herman to the priesthood and twice offered to send him to lead the Russian Orthodox Mission in China, but he refused, preferring the solitary life and remaining a simple monk. Years after he left for North America, Herman continued to keep in touch with his spiritual home. In a letter to Abbot Nazarius, he wrote, &quot;in my mind I imagine my beloved Valaam, and constantly behold it across the great ocean.&quot;

==Mission in Alaska==
The Russian colonization of the Americas began when Vitus Bering and Aleksei Chirikov discovered Alaska on behalf of the Russian Empire in 1741. The expedition harvested 1,500 sea otter pelts, which Chinese merchants bought for 1,000 rubles each at their trading post near Lake Baikal. This spurred a &quot;fur rush&quot; from 1741 to 1798 in which frontiersmen known as &quot;promyshlenniki&quot; explored Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. They alternately fought with and intermarried the native peoples. 

Grigory Shelikhov, a fur-trader, subjugated the native population of Kodiak Island. With Ivan Golikov, he founded a fur-trading company that eventually received a monopoly from the Imperial government; it became known as the Russian-American Company. Shelikhov founded a school for the natives, and many were converted to Russian Orthodox Christianity.

The Shelikhov-Golikov Company appealed to the Most Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church to provide a priest for the natives. Catherine the Great decided instead to send an entire mission to America. She entrusted the task of recruiting missionaries to Metropolitan Gabriel of St. Petersburg, who sent ten monks from Valaam, including Herman. The missionaries arrived on Kodiak on September 24, 1794.

Herman and the other missionaries encountered a harsh reality at Kodiak that did not correspond to Shelikhov&#x27;s rosy descriptions. The native Kodiak population, called &quot;Americans&quot; by the Russian settlers, were subject to harsh treatment by the Russian-American Company, which was being overseen by Shelikhov&#x27;s manager Alexander Baranov, who later became the first governor of the colony. 

The men were forced to hunt for sea otter even during harsh weather, and women and children were abused. The monks were also shocked at the widespread alcoholism in the Russian population, and the fact that most of the settlers had taken native mistresses. The monks themselves were not given the supplies that Shelikhov promised them, and had to till the ground with wooden implements. 

Despite these difficulties, the monks baptized more than 7,000 natives in the Kodiak region, and set about building a church and monastery. Herman was assigned in the bakery and acted as the mission&#x27;s steward (&quot;ekonom&quot;).

The monks became the defenders of the native Kodiak population. Herman was especially noted for his zeal in protecting them from the excessive demands of the RAC, and Baranov disparaged him in a letter as a &quot;hack writer and chatterer.&quot; A contemporary historian compares him to Bartolomé de las Casas, the Roman Catholic friar who defended the rights of native South Americans against the Spanish colonists.

After over a decade spent in Alaska, Herman became the head of the mission in 1807, although he was not ordained to the priesthood. The local population loved and respected him, and he had established good relations with Baranov. Herman ran the mission school, where he taught church subjects such as singing and catechism, alongside reading and writing. He also taught agriculture on Spruce Island. But, because he still longed for the life of a hermit, he retired from active duty in the mission and moved to Spruce Island.

==Life on Spruce Island==
Herman moved to Spruce Island around 1811 to 1817. The island is separated from Kodiak by a mile-wide strait, making it ideal for eremitic life. Herman named his hermitage &quot;New Valaam.&quot; He wore simple clothes and slept on a bench covered with a deerskin. When asked how he could bear to be alone in the forest, he replied, &quot;I am not alone. God is here, as God is everywhere.&quot;

Despite his solitary life, he soon gained a following. He received many visitors—especially native Alutiiq —on Sundays and church feasts. Soon a chapel and guesthouse were built next to his hermitage, and then a school for orphans. Herman had a few disciples, including the Creole orphan Gerasim Ivanovich Zyrianov, a young Aleut woman named Sofia Vlasova, and others. 

Entire families moved to the island in order to be closer to the Elder, who helped to sort out their disputes. Herman had a deep love for the native Aleuts: he stood up for them against the excesses of the Russian-American Company, and once during an epidemic, he was the only Russian to visit them, working tirelessly to care for the sick and console the dying. Herman spent the rest of his life on Spruce Island, where he died on November 15, 1837.

==Sainthood==
On March 11, 1969, the bishops of the Orthodox Church in America (OCA) formally declared their intention to canonize Herman, &quot;as a sublime example of the Holy Life, for our spiritual benefit, inspiration, comfort, and the confirmation of our Faith.&quot; On August 9, 1970, Metropolitan Ireney (Bekish) of the OCA along with Archbishop Paul (Olmari) of Finland and other hierarchs and clergy presided over the canonization service, which was held at Holy Resurrection Cathedral on Kodiak Island. His relics were transferred from his grave underneath the Sts. Sergius and Herman of Valaam Chapel (i.e., the Saints Sergius and Herman of Valaam Chapel), on Spruce Island, to the Holy Resurrection Cathedral.

On the same date, the bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (ROCOR) also canonized Herman at the Holy Virgin Cathedral (&quot;Joy of All Who Sorrow&quot;) in San Francisco. At the all-night vigil, the canon to Herman was read for the first time by Gleb Podmoshensky, one of the founding brothers of the St. Herman of Alaska Serbian Orthodox Brotherhood in 1963. He, Eugene (Seraphim) Rose, and Lawrence Campbell gathered material for the Synod of Bishops in order to support the glorification of Herman, and also helped compose the liturgical service in his honor.

There are several feast days throughout the year on which Saint Herman of Alaska is commemorated. Since there are two different calendars currently in use among various Orthodox churches, two dates are listed: the first date is the date on both the Revised Julian Calendar and the traditional Julian Calendar, the second date, after the slash, is the same day on the date on the more contemporary Gregorian Calendar date for the Julian Calendar date.

*July 27/August 9—Glorification: This is the anniversary of the joint-glorification (canonization) of Herman of Alaska as a saint in 1970.
*November 15/28—Repose: This is the anniversary of the actual death of Herman.
*December 13/26—Repose: Due to an error in record keeping, this was originally thought to be the day of Herman&#x27;s death, and because of the long-established tradition of celebrating his memory on this day, it has remained a feast day. It is more likely that this is the day he was buried. For those Orthodox Christians who follow the Julian Calendar, this day falls on December 26 of the Gregorian Calendar.
*Second Sunday after Pentecost:, as one of the saints commemorated on the Synaxis of the Saints of North America—this is a moveable feast of the ecclesiastical year, and the date of its observance will change from year to year.

The major portion of his relics are preserved at Holy Resurrection Cathedral in Kodiak, Alaska, His burial site at the Sts. Sergius and Herman Chapel, Spruce Island, Alaska is an important pilgrimage site. The devout will often take soil from his grave and water from the spring named in his honour. 

A portion of his relics are enshrined at the St. Ignatius Chapel at the Antiochan Village in Pennsylvania, a conference and retreat center of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America. He is regarded as one of their patron saints.

In 1963, with the blessing of John Maximovitch, Archbishop of Shanghai and San Francisco, a community of Orthodox booksellers and publishers called the St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood was formed to publish Orthodox missionary information in English. 

One of the founders was Father Seraphim Rose. The Brotherhood did much to advance the cause of Herman&#x27;s glorification as a saint. Saint Herman&#x27;s Orthodox Theological Seminary in Kodiak, Alaska is named in his honor, as are numerous parish churches throughout the world.

On Tuesday, August 4, 1970, the 91st Congress of the United States acknowledged the glorification of Herman of Alaska with a speech in the Senate, and his biography was formally entered into the Congressional Record.

In 1993, Patriarch Alexis II visited Kodiak to venerate the relics of Saint Herman. He left as a gift an ornate &quot;lampada&quot; (oil lamp) which burns constantly over the reliquary. Pilgrims from all over the world are anointed with holy oil from this &quot;lampada&quot;.

In 2022, Herman was officially added to the Episcopal Church liturgical calendar with a feast day on 15 November.

Finnish Orthodox Espoo Church in Tapiola, Espoo, is dedicated to St. Herman of Alaska.

<text>In mathematics, Hausdorff dimension is a measure of &quot;roughness&quot;, or more specifically, fractal dimension, that was introduced in 1918 by mathematician Felix Hausdorff. For instance, the Hausdorff dimension of a single point is zero, of a line segment is 1, of a square is 2, and of a cube is 3. That is, for sets of points that define a smooth shape or a shape that has a small number of corners—the shapes of traditional geometry and science—the Hausdorff dimension is an integer agreeing with the usual sense of dimension, also known as the topological dimension. However, formulas have also been developed that allow calculation of the dimension of other less simple objects, where, solely on the basis of their properties of scaling and self-similarity, one is led to the conclusion that particular objects—including fractals—have non-integer Hausdorff dimensions. Because of the significant technical advances made by Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch allowing computation of dimensions for highly irregular or &quot;rough&quot; sets, this dimension is also commonly referred to as the &quot;Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimension.&quot;

More specifically, the Hausdorff dimension is a dimensional number associated with a metric space, i.e. a set where the distances between all members are defined. The dimension is drawn from the extended real numbers, formula_1, as opposed to the more intuitive notion of dimension, which is not associated to general metric spaces, and only takes values in the non-negative integers.

In mathematical terms, the Hausdorff dimension generalizes the notion of the dimension of a real vector space. That is, the Hausdorff dimension of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional inner product space equals &quot;n&quot;. This underlies the earlier statement that the Hausdorff dimension of a point is zero, of a line is one, etc., and that irregular sets can have noninteger Hausdorff dimensions. For instance, the Koch snowflake shown at right is constructed from an equilateral triangle; in each iteration, its component line segments are divided into 3 segments of unit length, the newly created middle segment is used as the base of a new equilateral triangle that points outward, and this base segment is then deleted to leave a final object from the iteration of unit length of 4. That is, after the first iteration, each original line segment has been replaced with N=4, where each self-similar copy is 1/S = 1/3 as long as the original. Stated another way, we have taken an object with Euclidean dimension, D, and reduced its linear scale by 1/3 in each direction, so that its length increases to N=SD. This equation is easily solved for D, yielding the ratio of logarithms (or natural logarithms) appearing in the figures, and giving—in the Koch and other fractal cases—non-integer dimensions for these objects.

The Hausdorff dimension is a successor to the simpler, but usually equivalent, box-counting or Minkowski–Bouligand dimension.

==Intuition==

The intuitive concept of dimension of a geometric object &quot;X&quot; is the number of independent parameters one needs to pick out a unique point inside. However, any point specified by two parameters can be instead specified by one, because the cardinality of the real plane is equal to the cardinality of the real line (this can be seen by an argument involving interweaving the digits of two numbers to yield a single number encoding the same information). The example of a space-filling curve shows that one can even map the real line to the real plane surjectively (taking one real number into a pair of real numbers in a way so that all pairs of numbers are covered) and &quot;continuously&quot;, so that a one-dimensional object completely fills up a higher-dimensional object.

Every space-filling curve hits some points multiple times and does not have a continuous inverse. It is impossible to map two dimensions onto one in a way that is continuous and continuously invertible. The topological dimension, also called Lebesgue covering dimension, explains why. This dimension is the greatest integer &quot;n&quot; such that in every covering of &quot;X&quot; by small open balls there is at least one point where &quot;n&quot; + 1 balls overlap. For example, when one covers a line with short open intervals, some points must be covered twice, giving dimension &quot;n&quot; = 1.

But topological dimension is a very crude measure of the local size of a space (size near a point). A curve that is almost space-filling can still have topological dimension one, even if it fills up most of the area of a region. A fractal has an integer topological dimension, but in terms of the amount of space it takes up, it behaves like a higher-dimensional space.

The Hausdorff dimension measures the local size of a space taking into account the distance between points, the metric. Consider the number &quot;N&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) of balls of radius at most &quot;r&quot; required to cover &quot;X&quot; completely. When &quot;r&quot; is very small, &quot;N&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) grows polynomially with 1/&quot;r&quot;. For a sufficiently well-behaved &quot;X&quot;, the Hausdorff dimension is the unique number &quot;d&quot; such that N(&quot;r&quot;) grows as 1/&quot;rd&quot; as &quot;r&quot; approaches zero. More precisely, this defines the box-counting dimension, which equals the Hausdorff dimension when the value &quot;d&quot; is a critical boundary between growth rates that are insufficient to cover the space, and growth rates that are overabundant.

For shapes that are smooth, or shapes with a small number of corners, the shapes of traditional geometry and science, the Hausdorff dimension is an integer agreeing with the topological dimension. But Benoit Mandelbrot observed that fractals, sets with noninteger Hausdorff dimensions, are found everywhere in nature. He observed that the proper idealization of most rough shapes one sees is not in terms of smooth idealized shapes, but in terms of fractal idealized shapes:

Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.

For fractals that occur in nature, the Hausdorff and box-counting dimension coincide. The packing dimension is yet another similar notion which gives the same value for many shapes, but there are well-documented exceptions where all these dimensions differ.

==Formal definition==

The formal definition of the Hausdorff dimension is arrived at by defining first the d-dimensional Hausdorff measure, a fractional-dimension analogue of the Lebesgue measure. First, an outer measure is constructed:
Let formula_2 be a metric space. If formula_3 and formula_4,

:formula_5

where the infimum is taken over all countable covers formula_6 of formula_7. The Hausdorff d-dimensional outer measure is then defined as formula_8, and the restriction of the mapping to measurable sets justifies it as a measure, called the formula_9-dimensional Hausdorff Measure.

===Hausdorff dimension===

The Hausdorff dimension formula_10 of formula_2 is defined by
:formula_12

This is the same as the supremum of the set of formula_4 such that the formula_9-dimensional Hausdorff measure of formula_2 is infinite (except that when this latter set of numbers formula_9 is empty the Hausdorff dimension is zero).

===Hausdorff content===
The formula_9-dimensional unlimited Hausdorff content of formula_7 is defined by
:formula_19

In other words, formula_20 has the construction of the Hausdorff measure where the covering sets are allowed to have arbitrarily large sizes. (Here we use the standard convention that formula_21.) The Hausdorff measure and the Hausdorff content can both be used to determine the dimension of a set, but if the measure of the set is non-zero, their actual values may disagree.

==Examples==

* Countable sets have Hausdorff dimension 0.
* The Euclidean space formula_22 has Hausdorff dimension formula_23, and the circle formula_24 has Hausdorff dimension 1.
* Fractals often are spaces whose Hausdorff dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension. For example, the Cantor set, a zero-dimensional topological space, is a union of two copies of itself, each copy shrunk by a factor 1/3; hence, it can be shown that its Hausdorff dimension is ln(2)/ln(3) ≈ 0.63. The Sierpinski triangle is a union of three copies of itself, each copy shrunk by a factor of 1/2; this yields a Hausdorff dimension of ln(3)/ln(2) ≈ 1.58. These Hausdorff dimensions are related to the &quot;critical exponent&quot; of the Master theorem for solving recurrence relations in the analysis of algorithms.
* Space-filling curves like the Peano curve have the same Hausdorff dimension as the space they fill.
* The trajectory of Brownian motion in dimension 2 and above is conjectured to be Hausdorff dimension 2.

* Lewis Fry Richardson performed detailed experiments to measure the approximate Hausdorff dimension for various coastlines. His results have varied from 1.02 for the coastline of South Africa to 1.25 for the west coast of Great Britain.

==Properties of Hausdorff dimension==
=== Hausdorff dimension and inductive dimension ===
Let &quot;X&quot; be an arbitrary separable metric space. There is a topological notion of inductive dimension for &quot;X&quot; which is defined recursively. It is always an integer (or +∞) and is denoted dimind(&quot;X&quot;).

Theorem. Suppose &quot;X&quot; is non-empty. Then 
:formula_25
Moreover,
:formula_26
where &quot;Y&quot; ranges over metric spaces homeomorphic to &quot;X&quot;. In other words, &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; have the same underlying set of points and the metric &quot;d&quot;&quot;Y&quot; of &quot;Y&quot; is topologically equivalent to &quot;d&quot;&quot;X&quot;.

These results were originally established by Edward Szpilrajn (1907–1976), e.g., see Hurewicz and Wallman, Chapter VII.

=== Hausdorff dimension and Minkowski dimension ===
The Minkowski dimension is similar to, and at least as large as, the Hausdorff dimension, and they are equal in many situations. However, the set of rational points in [0, 1] has Hausdorff dimension zero and Minkowski dimension one. There are also compact sets for which the Minkowski dimension is strictly larger than the Hausdorff dimension.

=== Hausdorff dimensions and Frostman measures ===
If there is a measure μ defined on Borel subsets of a metric space &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) &gt; 0 and &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;B&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;r&quot;)) ≤ &quot;rs&quot; holds for some constant &quot;s&quot; &gt; 0 and for every ball &quot;B&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) in &quot;X&quot;, then dimHaus(&quot;X&quot;) ≥ &quot;s&quot;. A partial converse is provided by Frostman&#x27;s lemma.

=== Behaviour under unions and products ===
If formula_27 is a finite or countable union, then

:formula_28

This can be verified directly from the definition.

If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are non-empty metric spaces, then the Hausdorff dimension of their product satisfies

:formula_29

This inequality can be strict. It is possible to find two sets of dimension 0 whose product has dimension 1. In the opposite direction, it is known that when &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are Borel subsets of R&quot;n&quot;, the Hausdorff dimension of &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot; is bounded from above by the Hausdorff dimension of &quot;X&quot; plus the upper packing dimension of &quot;Y&quot;. These facts are discussed in Mattila (1995).

==Self-similar sets==

Many sets defined by a self-similarity condition have dimensions which can be determined explicitly. Roughly, a set &quot;E&quot; is self-similar if it is the fixed point of a set-valued transformation ψ, that is ψ(&quot;E&quot;) = &quot;E&quot;, although the exact definition is given below.

Theorem. Suppose

:formula_30

are each a contraction mapping on R&quot;n&quot; with contraction constant &quot;ri&quot; &lt; 1. Then there is a unique &quot;non-empty&quot; compact set &quot;A&quot; such that

:formula_31
The theorem follows from Stefan Banach&#x27;s contractive mapping fixed point theorem applied to the complete metric space of non-empty compact subsets of R&quot;n&quot; with the Hausdorff distance.

===The open set condition===

To determine the dimension of the self-similar set &quot;A&quot; (in certain cases), we need a technical condition called the &quot;open set condition&quot; (OSC) on the sequence of contractions ψ&quot;i&quot;.

There is an open set &quot;V&quot; with compact closure, such that

:formula_32

where the sets in union on the left are pairwise disjoint.

The open set condition is a separation condition that ensures the images ψ&quot;i&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) do not overlap &quot;too much&quot;.

Theorem. Suppose the open set condition holds and each ψ&quot;i&quot; is a similitude, that is a composition of an isometry and a dilation around some point. Then the unique fixed point of ψ is a set whose Hausdorff dimension is &quot;s&quot; where &quot;s&quot; is the unique solution of

:formula_33

The contraction coefficient of a similitude is the magnitude of the dilation.

In general, a set &quot;E&quot; which is carried onto itself by a mapping

: formula_34

is self-similar if and only if the intersections satisfy the following condition:

:formula_35

where &quot;s&quot; is the Hausdorff dimension of &quot;E&quot; and &quot;Hs&quot; denotes s-dimensional Hausdorff measure. This is clear in the case of the Sierpinski gasket (the intersections are just points), but is also true more generally:

Theorem. Under the same conditions as the previous theorem, the unique fixed point of ψ is self-similar.

<text>Heckler &amp; Koch GmbH (HK or H&amp;K; ) is a German firearms manufacturer that produces handguns, rifles, submachine guns, and grenade launchers. The company is located in Oberndorf am Neckar, Baden-Württemberg and also has subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, France, and the United States.

Heckler &amp; Koch was founded in 1949 by former Mauser engineers Edmund Heckler, Theodor Koch, and Alex Seidel, who founded the company out of the shuttered Mauser factory in Oberndorf. The company initially produced machine tool and metal parts until 1956 when, in response to a contract for a new service rifle, HK developed the Heckler &amp; Koch G3. The success of the G3 rifle prompted HK to transition to the defense industry. HK was owned by Royal Ordnance from 1991 to 2002, and is currently part of the Heckler &amp; Koch Group, comprising Heckler &amp; Koch GmbH, Heckler &amp; Koch Defense, NSAF Ltd., and Heckler &amp; Koch France SAS. The company&#x27;s motto is &quot;Keine Kompromisse!&quot; (No Compromises!).

Nicolas Walewski&#x27;s financial holding company CDE has held a majority stake in Heckler &amp; Koch since July 2020.

==History==
With the fall of Nazi Germany and the following Allied occupation of Germany, Oberndorf came under French control, and the entire Waffenfabrik Mauser AG factory was dismantled by French occupying forces. All factory records were destroyed on orders of the local French Army commander. In 1948, three former Mauser engineers, Edmund Heckler, Theodor Koch, and Alex Seidel, saved what they could from the factory and used what they had salvaged to start a machine tool plant in the vacant factory that became known as the Engineering Office Heckler &amp; Co.

On 28 December 1949, the Engineering Office Heckler &amp; Co. changed its name and was registered officially as Heckler &amp; Koch GmbH. Initially the new company manufactured machine tools, bicycle and sewing machine parts, gauges, and other precision parts. In 1956, Heckler &amp; Koch responded to the West German government&#x27;s tender for a new infantry rifle for the with the proposal of the G3 battle rifle, based on the Spanish CETME Model 58 rifle and developed in cooperation with CETME. The German government awarded Heckler &amp; Koch the tender and in 1959 declared the G3 the standard rifle of the . Later in 1961, Heckler &amp; Koch developed the 7.62×51mm HK21 general-purpose machine gun, based on the G3.

In 1966, Heckler &amp; Koch introduced the HK54 machine pistol, which eventually launched in 1969 as the MP5 submachine gun. Two years later, the company introduced the HK33 assault rifle, a smaller version of the G3 chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO.

===Diversification===
In 1974, Heckler &amp; Koch diversified into two more areas, HK Defense and Law Enforcement Technology and HK Hunting and Sports Firearms. Since then, HK has designed and manufactured more than 100 different types of firearms and devices for the world&#x27;s military and law enforcement organizations as well as sports shooters and hunters. In 1990, Heckler &amp; Koch completed two decades of development of their caseless weapon system and produced prototypes of the G11 rifle. The company also produced prototypes of the G41 assault rifle intended for the . Due to the international political climate at the time (East and West Germany uniting and defense budget cuts) the company was unable to secure funded contracts from the German government to support production of either weapon system and became financially vulnerable. The following year, Heckler &amp; Koch was sold to British Aerospace&#x27;s Royal Ordnance division.

During 1994 and 1995, the German government awarded Heckler &amp; Koch contracts for producing an updated standard assault rifle and updated standard sidearm for the . Heckler &amp; Koch developed and produced the Project HK50, a lightweight carbon fiber assault rifle, which became the G36 assault rifle. In addition, Heckler &amp; Koch produced the P8 pistol, derived from its USP handguns produced since 1989. The USP was adopted as the standard sidearm of the in 1994, and the G36 was adopted as their standard-issue rifle in 1995.

As the result of a 1999 merger between British Aerospace and Marconi Electronic Systems, Heckler &amp; Koch was owned by the resulting BAE Systems; it was contracted to refurbish the British Army&#x27;s SA80 rifles (which had been manufactured by Royal Ordnance) This contract entailed a modification program to the SA80 series of rifles to address a number of reliability issues with the design. In 2002, BAE Systems restructured and sold Heckler &amp; Koch to a group of private investors, who created the German group holding company HK Beteiligungs GmbH.

In 2003, HK Beteiligungs GmbH&#x27;s business organization restructured as Heckler &amp; Koch Jagd und Sportwaffen GmbH (HKJS), and its business was separated into the two business areas similar to the 1974 business mission areas: Defense, and Law Enforcement and Sporting Firearms. In 2004, Heckler &amp; Koch was awarded a major handgun contract for the United States Department of Homeland Security, worth a potential $26.2 million for up to 65,000 handguns. This contract ranks as the single largest handgun procurement contract in U.S. law enforcement history.
HK was contracted by the United States Army to produce the kinetic energy subsystem (see: kinetic projectiles or kinetic energy penetrator) of the Objective Individual Combat Weapon, a planned replacement for the M16 rifle/M203 grenade launcher combination. The OICW was designed to fire 5.56 mm rounds and 25 mm grenades. The kinetic energy component was also developed separately as the XM8, though both the OICW and XM8 are now indefinitely suspended.

Heckler &amp; Koch developed an AR-15/M4 carbine variant, marketed as the HK416. HK replaced the direct impingement system used by the Stoner design on the original M16 with a short-stroke piston operating system. The civilian models are named the MR223 and, in the U.S., the MR556A1.

In 2007, United States Secretary of the Army Pete Geren agreed to hold a &quot;dust chamber&quot; test pitting the M4 against the Heckler &amp; Koch HK416 and XM8, as well as the rival FN SCAR design. The Heckler &amp; Koch XM8 and FN SCAR had the fewest failures in the test, closely followed by the HK416, while the M4 had by far the most. In 2007, the Norwegian Army became the first to field the HK416 as a standard-issue rifle. 

HK sells its pistols in the United States to both law enforcement and civilian markets, through its HK USA subsidiary. The company has locations in Virginia, New Hampshire, and Georgia.

== Products ==

Heckler &amp; Koch has produced a variety of firearms including the G3, HK21, MP5, HK4, HK33, HK69, VP70, PSG1, USP, G36, MG4, UMP, MP7, and HK416 which have become some of the most iconic and widely adopted firearms in the world, used by dozens of militaries, police forces, and paramilitaries worldwide. Many of its prototype weapons including the G11, HK CAWS, XM29 OICW, and XM8, have also become recognizable. HK firearms use blowback operation, short-recoil, roller-delayed blowback, gas-delayed blowback, and short-stroke piston gas operation. HK is responsible for several innovations in firearms, such as the use of polymers in weapon designs, modern polygonal rifling, the feasibility of high-velocity caseless ammunition in prototype service rifles, and integral rails for handgun attachments.

=== HK naming system ===
Heckler &amp; Koch products use an internal naming system, consisting of an abbreviation and a two- or three-digit &quot;Werknummern&quot; designation popularly referred to as the &quot;HK 3-digit system&quot;. Each letter and digit is assigned a specific meaning outlined in the convention to make them easier to identify and differentiate by name.

The HK naming convention is not a fixed convention, but rather a guideline, and not all HK products follow it; this is typically done for marketing purposes or quirks in the weapon&#x27;s development or intended role. For instance, the HK416 does not use a proper abbreviation (&quot;HK&quot; does not mean anything specific), nor does it use proper digits (the HK416 was originally two models, the &quot;HK M4&quot; and &quot;HK M16&quot;, that were later amalgamated into the HK416); using the 3-digit system, the standard HK416 would likely be referred to as the G333. Such products tend to have proper internal designations anyway; the HK416 is internally referred to as the HK333.

==== Abbreviations ====
Most HK products have a prefix of between one and three letters, corresponding to a word or term in German (though some refer to English terms instead, with no German equivalent). Several were only used for a single model, such as the &quot;Universal&quot; weapons (UMP, UCP, USC, and USP). Some abbreviations are used as a suffix to designate specific variants.

==== &quot;Werknummern&quot; designations ====
The &quot;Werknummern&quot; designation system assigns two or three digits which correspond to the product&#x27;s technical specifics. They are placed after (or if a suffix, before) the abbreviation and denote the generation, form factor, and caliber or munition of the weapon.

==== Date code ====
The date code is a two-letter combination used to specify the year a weapon was manufactured in. These are not part of the product&#x27;s name, but are printed for identification directly on the weapon itself. They are only used on handguns.
Heckler &amp; Koch handguns produced at HK&#x27;s German facilities are marked with &quot;DE&quot;, Germany&#x27;s ISO 3166-1 code. Handguns manufactured in HK facilities outside Germany, or those produced in Germany before 2008, do not have the DE marking.

=== Trigger group ===
Heckler &amp; Koch long arms mostly follow a set of shared trigger group standards for selective fire and safety, with corresponding markings and pictograms.


==Trafficking==
H&amp;K has been accused of shipping small arms to conflict regions such as Bosnia and Nepal, and has licensed its weapons for production by governments with poor human rights records such as Sudan, Thailand and Myanmar. It has been argued that the company effectively evaded EU export restrictions when these licensees sold HK weapons to conflict zones including Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Sierra Leone.

According to the newspaper &quot;Stuttgarter Nachrichten&quot; (31 August 2011), as well as the state broadcaster ARD, a large stockpile of G36 assault rifles fell into rebel hands during the August 2011 attack on Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s compound in Tripoli. It is unclear how many were exported to Libya and by whom.

=== Illegal arms sales to Mexico ===
On 11 December 2011, federal, state and local Mexican police officers used battle rifles to fire on Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers&#x27; College students and peasant organizations to disperse a blockade on Mexican Federal Highway 95D, resulting in the deaths of students Jorge Alexis Herrera and Gabriel Echeverría de Jesús. According to media reports, 7.62×51mm NATO round casings were found at the scene, matching those used by H&amp;K G3 rifles. In Iguala and Cocula, corrupt police officers and cartelmen are known to have used H&amp;K G36 rifles during the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping on 26–27 September 2013. At least six teaching students were murdered by cartelmen and corrupt local police, and 43 others are missing and presumed dead. Other than the six identified persons, no other bodies have been found, and they are believed to have been incinerated.

As a result of efforts by civil society and human rights organizations in Mexico and Germany, H&amp;K and two of its former employees were brought before the Provincial Court of Stuttgart. After ten months of trial, on 21 February 2019, the court convicted them of illegally selling arms to Mexican governmental institutions which failed to acknowledge their due observance of human rights. The two former employees (sales manager Sahlmann and administrative employee Beuter) had been found to have used fraudulent permits in the sale of 4,700 rifles and large quantities of ammunition. H&amp;K was issued a fine of 3.7 million euros, and the two men received suspended sentences of 17 and 22 months. The spokesman of the Presidency of the Republic of Mexico, Jesús Ramírez Cuevas, said that the amount of the fine should go to the victims and their families. 

On 30 March 2021, Germany&#x27;s Federal Court of Justice (BGH) upheld the lower court&#x27;s decision, finding that H&amp;K employees knowingly falsified information on the nature and destination of arms sold by the company in order to attain federal export licenses.

<text>The Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 (, ) is a submachine gun developed in the 1960s by German firearms manufacturer Heckler &amp; Koch. It uses a similar modular design to the Heckler &amp; Koch G3, and has over 100 variants and clones, including selective fire, semi-automatic, suppressed, compact, and even marksman variants. The MP5 is one of the most widely used submachine guns in the world, having been adopted by over forty nations and numerous militaries, police forces, intelligence agencies, security organizations, paramilitaries, and non-state actors.

Attempts at replacing the MP5 by Heckler &amp; Koch began in the 1980s, but despite functional prototype weapons having promising performance, a formal successor did not enter commercial production until 1999, when Heckler &amp; Koch developed the UMP. However, despite being more expensive the MP5 remained the more successful of the two designs, because of its preexisting widespread use, design familiarity, and lower recoil due to its roller-delayed action as opposed to the UMP&#x27;s straight blowback action.

==History==
Heckler &amp; Koch, encouraged by the success of the G3 battle rifle in 1959, developed a family of small arms consisting of four types of firearms all based on a common G3 design layout and operating principle. The first type was chambered for 7.62×51mm NATO, the second for 7.62×39mm M43, the third for 5.56×45mm NATO, and the fourth for 9×19mm Parabellum. The MP5 was created for the fourth type as the HK54; under the HK naming system, this categorizes it as a selective fire carbine chambered in a handgun cartridge.

Development began in 1964, and in 1966 the HK54 was adopted by the &quot;Bundesgrenzschutz&quot; and by &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; special forces, initially as the &quot;MP64&quot;, before being redesignated as the MP5. The MP5A1 was introduced in the late 1960s and was the first model to feature the front ring sight and &quot;Slimline&quot; handguard. In 1970, the MP5 and MP5A1 were superseded by the MP5A2 and MP5A3, improvements to the MP5A1 with a fixed stock and retracting stock respectively. In 1974, the MP5SD, an integrally-suppressed variant, was introduced, and in 1976, the MP5K, a redesigned compact variant, was developed per a request for a variant that suited close-quarters combat in South America. In 1977, the original straight magazines were replaced by curved steel magazines. In 1978, the &quot;Tropical&quot; handguard was introduced for the MP5.

In 1980, the MP5 achieved an iconic status during the Iranian Embassy siege, when British Army Special Air Service operatives used MP5s with top-mounted flashlights to assault the embassy and rescue the hostages held inside. Photos of the operation featuring MP5s were widely disseminated in the press and popular media, and drove other military and police units to purchase MP5s as well, quickly making the MP5 widely recognizable and associated with elite counterterrorist units. The MP5 has since become a mainstay in militaries, special forces, and police tactical units across the world, but has gradually been replaced since the late 1990s by rifles, carbines, and personal defense weapons due to changes in armament trends, including growing access to body armor that can stop handgun cartridges.

The MP5 is manufactured under license in several nations including Greece (formerly Hellenic Arms Industry, currently Hellenic Defence Systems), Iran (Defense Industries Organization), Mexico (SEDENA), Pakistan (Pakistan Ordnance Factories), Saudi Arabia, Sudan (Military Industry Corporation), Turkey (MKEK), and the United Kingdom (formerly Royal Ordnance, later moved to Heckler &amp; Koch Great Britain).

== Design ==

The primary version of the MP5 family is the &quot;MP5A2&quot;, which is a selective fire delayed blowback-operated 9×19mm Parabellum weapon. It fires from a closed bolt (bolt forward) position.

The fixed, free-floating, cold hammer-forged barrel has six right-hand grooves with a 1 in 250 mm (1:10 in) rifling twist rate and is pressed and pinned into the receiver.

=== Features ===

The first MP5 models used a double-column straight box magazine, but since 1977, slightly curved steel magazines have been used with a 15-round capacity (weighing 0.12 kg) or a 30-round capacity (0.17 kg empty).

The adjustable iron sights (closed type) consist of a rotating rear diopter drum and a front post installed in a hooded ring. The rear sight is mechanically adjustable for both windage and elevation with the use of a special tool, being adjusted at the factory for firing at with standard FMJ 9×19mm NATO ammunition. The rear sight drum provides four apertures of varying diameters used to adjust the diopter system, according to the user&#x27;s preference and tactical situation. Changing between apertures does not change the point of impact down range.

The MP5 has a hammer firing mechanism. The trigger group is housed inside an interchangeable polymer trigger module (with an integrated pistol grip) and equipped with a three-position fire mode selector that serves as the manual safety toggle. Per HK trigger group standards, most MP5 variants have the option of &quot;SEF&quot; or &quot;Navy&quot; trigger groups, with further alterations based on the availability and type of burst fire; the &quot;SE&quot; and &quot;0-1&quot; trigger groups are only available for semi-automatic and civilian variants. While the &quot;SEF&quot; trigger group&#x27;s fire selector lever is located on the left-hand side of the trigger, the SEF symbols themselves appear on both sides of the trigger grouping; the &quot;Navy&quot; trigger group, among others, are ambidextrous. The safety/selector is rotated into the various firing settings or safety position by depressing the tail end of the lever. Tactile clicks (stops) are present at each position to provide a positive stop and prevent inadvertent rotation. The &quot;safe&quot; setting disables the trigger by blocking the hammer release with a solid section of the safety axle located inside the trigger housing.

The non-reciprocating cocking handle is located above the handguard and protrudes from the cocking handle tube at approximately a 45° angle. This rigid control is attached to a tubular piece within the cocking lever housing called the cocking lever support, which in turn makes contact with the forward extension of the bolt group. It is not however connected to the bolt carrier and therefore cannot be used as a forward assist to fully seat the bolt group. The cocking handle is held in a forward position by a spring detent located in the front end of the cocking lever support which engages in the cocking lever housing. The lever is locked back by pulling it fully to the rear and rotating it slightly clockwise where it can be hooked into an indent in the cocking lever tube.

=== Operating mechanism ===

The bolt rigidly engages the barrel extension—a cylindrical component welded to the receiver into which the barrel is pinned. The delay mechanism is of the same design as that used in the G3 rifle. The two-part bolt consists of a bolt head with rollers and a bolt carrier. The heavier bolt carrier lies up against the bolt head when the weapon is ready to fire and inclined planes on the front locking piece lie between the rollers and force them out into recesses in the barrel extension.

When fired, expanding propellant gases produced from the burning powder in the cartridge exert rearward pressure on the bolt head transferred through the base of the cartridge case as it is propelled out of the chamber. A portion of this force is transmitted through the rollers projecting from the bolt head, which are cammed inward against the inclined flanks of the locking recesses in the barrel extension and to the angled shoulders of the locking piece. The selected angles of the recesses and the incline on the locking piece produce a velocity ratio of about 4:1 between the bolt carrier and the bolt head. This results in a calculated delay, allowing the projectile to exit the barrel and gas pressure to drop to a safe level before the case is extracted from the chamber.

The delay results from the amount of time it takes for enough recoil energy to be transferred through to the bolt carrier in a sufficient quantity for it to be driven to the rear against the force of inertia of the bolt carrier and the forward pressure exerted against the bolt by the recoil spring. As the rollers are forced inward they displace the locking piece and propel the bolt carrier to the rear. The bolt carrier&#x27;s rearward velocity is four times that of the bolt head since the cartridge remains in the chamber for a short period of time during the initial recoil impulse. After the bolt carrier has travelled rearward 4 mm, the locking piece is withdrawn fully from the bolt head and the rollers are compressed into the bolt head. Only once the locking rollers are fully cammed into the bolt head can the entire bolt group continue its rearward movement in the receiver, breaking the seal in the chamber and continuing the feeding cycle.

Since the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge is relatively low powered, the bolt does not have an anti-bounce device like the G3, but instead the bolt carrier contains of tungsten granules that prevent the bolt group from bouncing back after impacting the barrel extension. The weapon has a fluted chamber that enhances extraction reliability by bleeding gases backwards into the shallow flutes running along the length of the chamber to prevent the cartridge case from expanding and sticking to the chamber walls (since the bolt is opened under relatively high barrel pressure). A spring extractor is installed inside the bolt head and holds the case securely until it strikes the ejector arm and is thrown out of the ejection port to the right of the receiver. The lever-type ejector is located inside the trigger housing (activated by the movement of the recoiling bolt).

=== Accessories ===
====Barrel accessories====
Threading is provided at the muzzle to work with certain muzzle devices made by Heckler &amp; Koch, including a slotted flash suppressor, a blank-firing adapter (marked with a red-painted band denoting use with blank ammunition only), a rifle grenade adapter (for use with rifle-style grenades with an inside diameter of 22 mm using a special grenade launching cartridge), and cup-type tear gas rifle grenade adapter. An optional &quot;3-Lug&quot; barrel is also available on some variants for mounting a quick-detachable suppressor.

===== MP5SD suppressor =====

The MP5SD&#x27;s barrel has 30 ports drilled forward of the chamber through which escaping gases are diverted to the surrounding sealed tubular casing that is screwed onto threading on the barrel&#x27;s external surface just prior to the ported segment. The MP5SD&#x27;s integral suppressor itself is divided into two stages: the initial segment surrounding the ported barrel serves as an expansion chamber for the propellant gases, reducing gas pressure to slow down the acceleration of the projectile. The second decompression stage occupies the remaining length of the suppressor tube and contains a stamped metal helix separator with several compartments which increase the gas volume and decrease its temperature, deflecting the gases as they exit the muzzle, so muffling the exit report. The bullet leaves the muzzle at subsonic velocity, so it does not generate a sonic shock wave in flight. As a result of reducing the barrel&#x27;s length and venting propellant gases into the suppressor, the bullet&#x27;s muzzle velocity was lowered anywhere from 16% to 26% (depending on the ammunition used) while maintaining the weapon&#x27;s automation and reliability.

====Receiver====
The receiver housing has a proprietary claw-rail mounting system that permits the attachment of a standard Heckler &amp; Koch quick-detachable scope mount (also used with the G3, HK33, and G3SG/1). It can be used to mount daytime optical sights (telescopic 4×24), night sights, reflex sights, and laser sights. The mount features two spring-actuated bolts, positioned along the base of the mount, which exert pressure on the receiver to hold the mount in the same position at all times assuring zero retention. All versions of the quick-detachable scope mount provide a sighting tunnel through the mount so that the shooter can continue to use the fixed iron sights with the scope mount attached to the top of the receiver.

A Picatinny rail adapter can be placed on top that locks into the claw rails. This allows the mounting of STANAG scopes and has a lower profile than the claw-rail system.

====Handguard====

Standard MP5 variants have the option of two handguards: &quot;Slimline&quot;, the original slim checkered metal handguard; and &quot;Tropical&quot;, a wider and smoother polymer handguard introduced in 1978.

The MP5SD, MP5K, and SP89 have unique handguards owing to their design differences: the MP5SD handguard is similar to Slimline but larger to fit the integrated suppressor, the MP5K handguard has a built-in foregrip and handstop, and the SP89 handguard is similar to the MP5K&#x27;s but extended and without the foregrip.

Aftermarket handguards also exist, including newer vented handguards based on the &quot;Tropical&quot; handguard, &quot;dedicated forend&quot; handguards featuring a built-in underbarrel tactical light, and rail integration system-equipped handguards to fit attachments.

== Variants ==
=== MP5 ===

;HK54
:Original pre-designation model, introduced in 1964. It has a charcoal-gray phosphated finish rather than the matte-black lacquered finish used on later models. The handguard resembles the &quot;Slimline&quot; handguard but is narrower and has slots along it. Its bolt carrier is longer and heavier than that of the final MP5, and it uses a flip-up &quot;ladder&quot; rear sight similar to that used on early G3 models. It uses straight steel magazines with plastic followers and distinctive &quot;waffle&quot; rib imprints for reinforcement.
;MP5
:The basic MP5, based on a modified and improved HK54, introduced in 1966. When first released, it had a gray phosphated finish, &quot;Slimline&quot; handguard, 8.9-inch barrel with &quot;3-Lug&quot; muzzle, and straight waffle magazines. Modernized improvements were introduced in the 1970s: proprietary &quot;claw mount&quot; rails for scope, laser, and flashlight attachments were introduced in 1973; un-ribbed curved magazines with chrome followers were introduced in 1977; the matte-black lacquered finish was introduced for export models also in 1977; and the polymer &quot;Tropical&quot; handguard was introduced in 1978.
;MP5A1
:Standard MP5 with no stock and the &quot;SEF&quot; or &quot;Navy&quot; trigger group.
;MP5A2
:Standard MP5 with a fixed stock and the &quot;SEF&quot; or &quot;Navy&quot; trigger group.
;MP5A3
:Standard MP5 with a retractable stock and the &quot;SEF&quot; or &quot;Navy&quot; trigger group.
;MP5A4
:Standard MP5 with a fixed stock, the &quot;Navy 3-Round Burst&quot; trigger group, and a straight pistol grip.
;MP5A5
:Standard MP5 with a retractable stock, the &quot;Navy 3-Round Burst&quot; trigger group, and a straight pistol grip.
;MP5SF
:Semi-automatic variant of the MP5 intended for the law enforcement and military markets, introduced in 1986 to meet a Federal Bureau of Investigation request for a &quot;9mm semi-automatic carbine&quot;. Unlike the HK94, the semi-automatic MP5 variant for the civilian market, the MP5SF retains its standard 8.9-inch barrel. It has two variants: the MP5SFA2 with a fixed stock, and the MP5SFA3 with a retractable stock. It uses the &quot;0-1&quot; trigger group, but since 1991, it has been delivered with select-fire bolt carriers that make it capable of automatic fire if paired with an appropriate trigger group.
;MP5PT
:Training variants of the MP5A4 and MP5A5. They are designed to use a plastic 9×19mm round developed by Dynamit Nobel.
;MP5N
:Naval variant of the MP5, introduced in 1986 to meet a United States Navy request for a submachine gun effective aboard ships and in low-light conditions. It is essentially an MP5A3 with a retractable stock, &quot;Navy 2-Round Burst&quot; trigger group, tritium illuminated sights, and a custom &quot;3-Lug&quot; muzzle derivative for mounting a stainless steel suppressor produced by Knight&#x27;s Armament Company (KAC).
;MP5F
:Improved French variant of the MP5, introduced in 1999 to meet a French National Gendarmerie request for a suitable standard-issue submachine gun. It is essentially a modified and improved MP5A3, featuring a padded retractable stock, &quot;Navy&quot; trigger group, ambidextrous sling mounts, and internal improvements to handle high-pressure ammunition.
;MP5 Mid Life Improvement (MLI)
:Modernized refresh of the MP5, introduced in 2015. It is based on the MP5A5 and features the MP5F&#x27;s padded retractable stock, triple-rail &quot;Slimline&quot; handguard, &quot;Navy 3-Round Burst&quot; trigger group, quick-release sight mount or sight rail, and a RAL 8000 finish. Compatible components of the MP5 MLI can be switched out and retrofitted with other compatible MP5 variants.

=== MP5SD ===

The MP5SD (&quot;SD&quot; meaning &quot;Schalldämpfer&quot;, German for &quot;sound suppressor&quot;) is a variant of the MP5 with an integral suppressor, introduced in 1974. The integral suppressor, built around its 5.7-inch barrel, uses a unique two-stage design that allows it to operate silently in most environments, including when wet, while still remaining reliable. The distinctive size of the integral suppressor gives it a unique handguard design, with a modified charging handle to account for it. The MP5SD has a rate of fire of approximately 800 rounds per minute, and is intended for use with both standard and subsonic ammunition.
:Standard MP5SD with no stock and the &quot;SEF&quot; or &quot;Navy&quot; trigger group.
;MP5SD2
:Standard MP5SD with a fixed stock and the &quot;SEF&quot; or &quot;Navy&quot; trigger group.
;MP5SD3
:Standard MP5SD with a retractable stock and the &quot;SEF&quot; or &quot;Navy&quot; trigger group.
;MP5SD4
:Standard MP5SD with no stock and the &quot;SEF&quot; or &quot;Navy&quot; trigger group. It is largely similar to the MP5SD1.
;MP5SD5
:Standard MP5SD with a fixed stock and the &quot;Navy 3-Round Burst&quot; trigger group.
;MP5SD6
:Standard MP5SD with a retractable stock and the &quot;Navy 3-Round Burst&quot; trigger group.
;MP5SDN-1
:Naval variant of the MP5SD, with a retractable stock, the &quot;Navy 2-Round Burst&quot; trigger group, and the MP5N&#x27;s KAC stainless steel suppressor.
;MP5SDN-2
:Naval variant of the MP5SD, with a fixed stock, the &quot;Navy 2-Round Burst&quot; trigger group, and the MP5N&#x27;s KAC stainless steel suppressor.

=== MP5K ===

The MP5K (&quot;K&quot; meaning &quot;Kurz&quot;, German for &quot;short&quot;) is a redesigned compact variant of the MP5, introduced in 1976. Developed from the stockless MP5A1, it features a 4.5-inch barrel incompatible with muzzle attachments, an endcap with sling mount instead of a stock, and a unique handguard with a built-in foregrip. Most components of the MP5K are shortened on account of its compact design, including its bolt, receiver, charging handle, cover, and trigger group frame; the lighter bolt gives it a higher rate of fire, at approximately 900 rounds per minute (as opposed to 800 rounds per minute with the regular MP5). Different variants of the MP5K use either unique open iron sights or redesigned fixed iron sights.

;MP5K Prototype
:Stockless, cut-down MP5A2 with regular iron sights and an open vertical foregrip, developed in 1976.
;MP5KA1
:Standard MP5K with the &quot;SEF&quot; trigger group, smooth upper surface, and small low-profile iron sights.
;MP5KA4
:Standard MP5K with the &quot;Navy 3-Round Burst&quot; trigger group and regular iron sights.
;MP5KA5
:Standard MP5K with the &quot;Navy 3-Round Burst&quot; trigger group, smooth upper surface, and small low-profile iron sights.
;MP5K-N
:Naval variant of the MP5K, with the &quot;Navy&quot; trigger group and a custom &quot;3-Lug&quot; muzzle similar to that of the MP5N.
;MP5K-PDW
:&quot;Full-size&quot; variant of the MP5K, introduced in 1991. It is designed to provide the benefits of the MP5K with the size and handling of a regular MP5, and is essentially a regular MP5K with a custom folding stock, &quot;Navy&quot; trigger group, and 5.5-inch barrel with a custom &quot;3-Lug&quot; muzzle similar to that of the MP5N but for a Qual-A-Tec suppressor. Despite its name, the MP5K-PDW is not a personal defense weapon, as it uses a handgun cartridge and not the sub-intermediate cartridges used by actual PDWs; rather, its name is derived from its intended use as a self-protection firearm for vehicle and aircraft crews.
;MP5K Operational Briefcase
:Standard MP5K intended for use with the &quot;Spezialkoffer&quot; (&quot;Special Case&quot;), a custom briefcase built by Hofbauer GmbH with a modified claw mount for holding the MP5K, a firing port, and a trigger built into the briefcase handgrip, introduced in 1978. Intended for security details in close-range defense or suppressive fire situations, the MP5K Operational Briefcase uses a firing mechanism built into the briefcase to allow the MP5K to fire without taking time to remove it; however, it cannot be reloaded, cleared of obstructions, or emptied of spent shell casings without opening the briefcase and detaching the MP5K.
;MP5K Special Bag
:Variant of the MP5K Operational Briefcase introduced around 1978, using a leather suitcase called the &quot;Spezialtasche&quot; (&quot;Special Bag&quot;). Instead of using the handgrip as a trigger, the &quot;Spezialtasche&quot; features a hidden opening that allows the user to discreetly reach into the bag and fire the MP5K directly.
;MP5K Falling Case
:Variant of the MP5K Operational Briefcase introduced around 1978, using a detachable briefcase called the &quot;Zerfallkoffer&quot; (&quot;Falling Case&quot;). Instead of allowing the MP5K to fire within the case, the &quot;Zerfallkoffer&quot;″s handgrip and claw mount is designed to be quickly detached from the briefcase, &quot;shedding&quot; it and allowing the MP5K to be used as normal, albeit with a carryhandle. The &quot;Zerfallkoffer&quot; is also compatible with the MP7.

=== Rechambered variants ===

Though the MP5 is normally chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum, two variants and an unreleased kit existed that used different ammunition.

;MP5/10
:MP5 chambered in 10mm Auto, introduced in 1992. It features either a fixed or retractable stock, the &quot;Navy 2-Round Burst&quot; trigger group, and the MP5N&#x27;s custom &quot;3-Lug&quot; muzzle derivative and tritium illuminated sights. It includes a bolt hold-open device, which catches the bolt in its rear position when empty, and is released by pressing a lever on the left side of the receiver. It is fed by custom 30-round translucent straight magazines. The MP5/10 was discontinued in 2000, but HK still offers support and spare parts.
;MP5/40
:MP5 chambered in .40 S&amp;W, introduced in 1992. It has largely the same features and configuration options of the MP5/10, and is fed by similar 30-round translucent straight magazines, but uses the regular &quot;Navy&quot; trigger group (without the burst-fire selection). The MP5/40 was discontinued in 2000, but HK still offers support and spare parts.
;MP5 .22 LR
:MP5 chambered in .22 Long Rifle, introduced around 2021. It comes in two variants: the MP5 .22 LR Rifle, which resembles an MP5SD3 with a 16.1-inch barrel hidden by a faux &quot;integral suppressor&quot; barrel shroud; and the MP5 .22 LR Pistol, which resembles an MP5A1 or MP5A3 with an 8.5-inch barrel. Both variants use the &quot;Tropical&quot; handguard and the &quot;0-1&quot; trigger group. Like all civilian market MP5 variants, it is semi-automatic only.
;MP5 .22 Long Rifle Rechambering Kit
:Rechambering kit to convert an MP5 to .22 Long Rifle, introduced in the early 1970s and discontinued at an indeterminate point. The kit consisted of a barrel insert, a bolt group, and two 20-round magazines, and was mostly sold to law enforcement agencies for training purposes by easing trainees inexperienced with the MP5 into learning handling techniques and firing practice without the high recoil and cost of 9×19mm rounds. The conversion reduced the MP5&#x27;s rate of fire to 650 rounds per minute. It was ultimately replaced by the MP5 .22 LR in 2021.
;MP5 6.5×25mm Rechambering Kit
:Rechambering kit to convert an MP5 to 6.5×25mm CBJ, which was proposed in the 2000s but never released. It would have allowed an MP5 to be rechambered simply by switching its barrel.

=== Civilian variants ===

;HK94
:Civilian market variant of the MP5, imported from 1983 to 1989 (with a one-off final order for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation delivered in 1991). It has a 16.54-inch barrel, &quot;0-1&quot; trigger group, push-button magazine release (as opposed to the paddle magazine release on regular MP5s), and a straight pistol grip similar to that on the MP5A4 and MP5A5. It has two variants: the HK94A2 with a fixed stock, and the HK94A3 with a retractable stock. Optional accessories included a handguard-mounted foregrip and a ventilated barrel shroud. The HK94 was particularly popular as a prop in film and television productions of the era, and blank-firing HK94s with &quot;chopped&quot; 8.9-inch barrels and fake automatic conversions were often used as cost-effective MP5 stand-ins well into the 2010s.
;HK94/SG-1
:Accurized sharpshooting variant of the HK94, introduced in 1985. It was designed and intended for marksman fire in situations and environments where precise handgun cartridge fire may be needed, such as dense urban areas and indoor environments like prisons. It has a fixed match stock with a rubber buttpad and an adjustable cheekpiece, a folding bipod, a flash hider, and a Leupold 6x telescopic sight. A PSG1-inspired aftermarket trigger pack was also produced, featuring a target pistol grip and match trigger. The HK94/SG-1 did not sell very well due to its niche role and poor performance—it had poor range, penetration, and stopping power, and its Leupold scope was calibrated for .223 Remington and not 9×19mm—and only 50 units were imported to the U.S., primarily to target shooters and firearm collectors.
;SP89
:Civilian market variant of the MP5K, imported to the U.S. between 1989 and 1994. To comply with the National Firearms Act, the SP89 features a redesigned handguard that replaces the MP5K&#x27;s built-in foregrip with an extended barrel shroud. Like all civilian market MP5 variants, it is semi-automatic only.
;SP5K
:Modernized SP89 for the American civilian market, imported to the U.S. as a pistol in 2017. It largely resembles the SP89, with a redesigned extended barrel shroud and a top-mounted Picatinny rail for sights. Like all civilian market MP5 variants, it is semi-automatic only.
;SP5
:Modernized civilian market variant of the MP5 introduced in 2019, replacing the HK94. It resembles an MP5A2 with an 8.8-inch barrel, MP5K-style threaded adaptor, &quot;Tropical&quot; handguard, &quot;0-1&quot; trigger group, paddle magazine release, fluted chamber, and the buyer&#x27;s choice of fixed stock, retractable stock, or endcap.
;SP5K-PDW
:Modernized civilian market variant of the MP5K introduced in 2019, replacing the SP5K. It resembles an MP5K without its handguard foregrip. Like all civilian market MP5 variants, it is semi-automatic only.

=== Prototypes ===
Five prototype firearms based on the MP5 were developed by Heckler &amp; Koch in the 1980s and 1990s, mostly intended as improved variants or potential successors, but were not developed any further.

;HK54A1
:Prototype improvement of the HK54, designed for the U.S. Navy Naval Weapons Support Center Crane&#x27;s (NWSC) Joint Service Small Arms Program (JSSAP) in 1980. It was essentially a refreshed ambidextrous MP5SD with a redesigned retractable stock and compatibility with a 50-round drum magazine. It was designed to be suitable for frogmen and paratroopers in any environment, and was thus also designed to be reliably functional in extreme temperatures and while wearing bulky gloves. HK&#x27;s proposal for the HK54A1 noted it could be converted to .45 ACP if necessary. An unknown number were produced for testing purposes out of regular MP5 components. The HK54A1 was never properly developed for field use, but it met most JSSAP requirements, drawing the attention of the U.S. government and leading to the development of the SMG I and SMG II.
;SMG I
:Prototype derived from the HK54A1, first developed for the JSSAP between 1982 and 1983. It was intended to spawn a &quot;family&quot; of modular all-purpose submachine guns. Unique for HK, the SMG I used a simple blowback operation with separate lower and upper receivers and an easy-to-remove 5.8-inch barrel with an integral suppressor. It had a boxy body with a retractable stock and a diagonal foregrip. A mechanical and hydraulic buffer in the backplate and a timing device in the stock reduced its rate of fire to a manageable 500 rounds per minute, roughly half that of the HK54A1. The rear iron sight, resembling that of the HK21E, allowed for adjustments based on wind, ammunition type, and sight elevation, and also featured indents to assist with close-range point shooting. The trigger included an add-on to be used with bulkier gloves such as mittens. Only 20 handmade examples were produced. The SMG I was tested by NWSC Crane in 1984 and proved promising, but several minor issues prompted the development of the SMG II.
;SMG II
:Prototype derived from the SMG I, developed around 1985. It has a largely identical design but addresses the issues reported by NWSC Crane. Its combination of the MP5, MP5SD, and MP5K was made more clear: analogous to the MP5 by default, the addition of a custom suppressor made it akin to the MP5SD, and the removal of the suppressor and retractable stock converted it into an MP5K-like automatic pistol. The three-round burst fire setting returned from the HK54A1. Several components were made from plastic to reduce weight, while the over-engineered rear sight was abandoned for a simpler MP5-style sight. Uniquely, the SMG II had a gas cylinder in the handguard with a gas relief valve on the receiver, used to control round velocity and thus also sound: the &quot;L&quot; setting reduced the propellant gases to fire rounds below the speed of sound—and thus without the usual crack of supersonic projectiles—for almost silent suppressed fire, while the &quot;H&quot; setting used all available gas to fire rounds at full velocity for reliable unsuppressed fire. Other internal changes were made to reduce cost and simplify production and maintenance, but otherwise the SMG II was largely just an improvement of the SMG I. Like the SMG I, only 20 handmade examples were produced for testing by NWSC Crane. While the SMG II again proved promising, it was ultimately abandoned, not for budgetary or technical concerns, but simply due to the success of the regular MP5 and its derivatives, which were already popular enough with the U.S. Navy and all other potential customers to make a replacement unnecessary; HK ultimately developed the MP5N for the U.S. Navy instead. Allegedly, between 60 and 80 additional SMG IIs were secretly commissioned for an unidentified U.S. government agency, possibly a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community, where they were favored by their users, but the lack of spare parts and the gradual move to higher-caliber firearms for close-quarters combat led to all of them being retired and melted down for disposal some time around 1999. Technical knowledge from the SMG II and the concept of a universal submachine gun were later repurposed for the MP2000 prototype and the UMP.
;MP5 PIP
:Prototype developed around the late 1980s and early 1990s. Very little is known about the MP5 PIP or why it was developed, but it had a boxier body resembling the later UMP, a shorter diagonal magazine, and the &quot;flipper&quot; charging handle later used on the G36. Only one non-functional wooden mockup was produced.
;MP2000
:Prototype derived from the SMG II, developed in the 1990s. It somewhat resembled the SMG II and featured a propellant gas-based round velocity silencing system similar to that of the SMG II. It was presumably an attempted revival of the SMG II concept to replace the MP5 for the 21st century. It is an immediate predecessor of the UMP, which was ultimately marketed as such.

===Manufactured without license===

In the United States, PTR Industries, Zenith Firearms, Dakota Tactical, and Century International Arms manufacture semi-automatic clones of the MP5 that are legally classified as pistols. In 2007, Professional Arms demonstrated the MK5, an MP5 clone that could be rechambered between 9×19mm, .45 ACP, and .40 S&amp;W.

<doc id="14298" wikidata="Q143317" url="?curid=14298" title="Henry Middleton">
<text>Henry Middleton (1717 – June 13, 1784) was an American politician and planter from South Carolina. A member of the colonial legislature, during the American Revolution he attended the First Continental Congress and served as that body&#x27;s president for four days in 1774 after the passage of the Continental Association, which he signed. He left the Second Continental Congress before it declared independence. Back in South Carolina, he served as president of the provincial congress and senator in the newly created state government. After his capture by the British in 1780, he accepted defeat and returned to the status of a British subject until the end of the war.

==Early life==
Henry Middleton was born in 1717 on the family plantation, &quot;The Oaks&quot;, near Charleston, Province of South Carolina. He was the second son of Susan (née Amory) Middleton (1690-1722) and Arthur Middleton (1681–1737), a wealthy planter who had served as an acting governor of South Carolina. His grandfather, Edward Middleton, emigrated from England via Barbados. He was educated in England before returning to South Carolina to inherit his father&#x27;s plantation. He became one of the largest landowners in the colony, owning and about 800 slaves.

==Public career==
Middleton served in a variety of public offices in South Carolina. He was a justice of the peace and a member of the Commons House of Assembly, where he was elected speaker in 1747, 1754, and 1755. He was a member of provincial council but resigned in 1770 in opposition to British policy.

In 1774, at the outset of the American Revolution, Middleton was selected as a delegate to the Continental Congress. He served as that body&#x27;s president during the last few days of the First Continental Congress, following the departure of Peyton Randolph. Middleton opposed declaring independence from Great Britain and resigned from the Second Continental Congress in February 1776 when more radical delegates began pushing for independence. He was succeeded in Congress by his son Arthur who was more radical than his father and became a signer of the Declaration of Independence.

After Middleton&#x27;s return to South Carolina, he was elected president of the provincial congress and, beginning on November 16, 1775, served on the council of safety. In 1776, he and his son Arthur helped frame a temporary state constitution. In 1779, he became a state senator in the new government.

When Charleston was captured by the British at the Siege of Charleston in 1780, Middleton accepted defeat and status as a British subject. This reversal apparently did not damage his reputation in the long run, because of his previous support of the Revolution, and he did not suffer the fate of having his estates confiscated, as many Loyalists did after the war.

==Personal life==
In 1741, Middleton was married to Mary Baker Williams (1721–1761), the daughter of John Williams, an early South Carolina planter who began building what is today known as Middleton Place around 1730. Together, Henry and Mary were the parents of five sons and seven daughters, seven of whom survived to adulthood, including:

* Arthur Middleton (1742–1787), a signer of the Declaration of Independence who married Mary Izard (1747–1814).
* Henrietta Middleton (1750–1792), who married Governor Edward Rutledge.
* Thomas Middleton (1753–1797), who married Anne Manigault.
* Hester Middleton (1754–1789), who married Charles Drayton.
* Sarah Middleton (1756–1784), who married Charles Cotesworth Pinckney.
* Mary Middleton (1757-1825), who married Peter Smith.
* Susannah Middleton (1760–1834), who married Continental Congressman John Parker.

After his wife&#x27;s death in 1761, Middleton would go on to marry twice more. His second marriage was to Maria Henrietta Bull (1722–1772), daughter of William Bull Sr., the lieutenant governor of South Carolina, in 1762. His second wife&#x27;s sister, Charlotta (née Bull) Drayton, was the mother of Continental Congressman William Henry Drayton, and her brother, William Bull II, served as governor of South Carolina before leaving the colony in 1782 when British troops were evacuated at the end of the War.

After his second wife&#x27;s death in 1772, he married for the third time, although it was her fourth marriage, to Lady Mary McKenzie, the daughter of George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie, in 1776. Among Lady Mary&#x27;s brothers were John Mackenzie, Lord MacLeod and George Mackenzie. Her father was a Scottish nobleman who followed Charles Edward Stuart, the Jacobite Pretender. The Earl of Cromartie was tried and sentenced to death, but he obtained a conditional pardon although his peerage was forfeited.

Middleton died on June 13, 1784, in Charleston. He was buried at Goosecreek Churchyard, St. James Parish, Berkeley County, South Carolina.

===Descendants===
His grandson, also named Henry (1770–1846), had a long career in politics. He was governor of South Carolina (1810–1812), U.S. Representative (1815–1819), and the minister to Russia (1820–1830). Henry had fourteen children, including Williams Middleton and Edward Middleton.

<doc id="14299" wikidata="Q170486" url="?curid=14299" title="Ham">
<text>Ham is pork from a leg cut that has been preserved by wet or dry curing, with or without smoking. As a processed meat, the term &quot;ham&quot; includes both whole cuts of meat and ones that have been mechanically formed.

Ham is made around the world, including a number of regional specialties. In addition, numerous ham products have specific geographical naming protection.

== History ==
The preserving of pork leg as ham has a long history, with traces of production of cured ham among the Etruscan civilization known in the 6th and 5th century BC.

Cato the Elder wrote about the &quot;salting of hams&quot; in his &quot; tome around 160 BC.

There are claims that the Chinese were the first people to mention the production of cured ham. &quot; claims an origin from Gaul. It was certainly well established by the Roman period, as evidenced by an import trade from Gaul mentioned by Marcus Terentius Varro in his writings.

The modern word &quot;ham&quot; is derived from the Old English &#x27; or &#x27; meaning the hollow or bend of the knee, from a Germanic base where it meant &#x27;crooked&#x27;. It began to refer to the cut of pork derived from the hind leg of a pig around the 15th century.

Because of the preservation process, ham is a compound foodstuff or ingredient, being made up of the original meat, as well as the remnants of the preserving agent(s), such as salt, but it is still recognised as a food in its own right.

== Methods ==
Ham is produced by curing raw pork by salting, also known as dry curing, or brining, also known as wet curing. Additionally, smoking may be employed, and seasonings may be added.

=== Dry-cured ===

Traditional dry cure hams may use only salt as the curative agent, although this is comparatively rare. This process involves cleaning the raw meat, covering it in salt while it is gradually pressed to squeeze out fluid. Specific herbs and spices may be used to add flavour during this step. The hams are then washed and hung in a dark, temperature-regulated place until dry. It is then hung to air for another period of time.

The duration of the curing process varies by the type of ham. For example, Jinhua ham takes approximately 8 to 10 months to complete, jamón serrano cures in 9–12 months, prosciutto di Parma takes more than 12 months, and Iberian ham can take up to 2 years to reach the desired flavor characteristics. Many dry-cured hams, such as prosciutto, are eaten without being cooked.

Most modern dry cure hams also use nitrites (either sodium nitrite or potassium nitrite), which are added along with the salt. Nitrites are used because they prevent bacterial growth and, in a reaction with the meat&#x27;s myoglobin, give the product a desirable dark red color. The amount and mixture of salt and nitrites used have an effect on the shrinkage of the meat. Because of the toxicity of nitrite, some areas specify a maximum allowable content of nitrite in the final product. Under certain conditions, especially during cooking, nitrites in meat can react with degradation products of amino acids, forming nitrosamines, which are known carcinogens.

The dry curing of ham involves a number of enzymatic reactions. The enzymes involved are proteinases (cathepsins – B, D, H &amp; L, and calpains) and exopeptidases (peptidase and aminopeptidase). These enzymes cause proteolysis of muscle tissue, which creates large numbers of small peptides and free amino acids, while the adipose tissue undergoes lipolysis to create free fatty acids. Salt and phosphates act as strong inhibitors of proteolytic activity. Animal factors influencing enzymatic activity include age, weight, and breed. During the process itself, conditions such as temperature, duration, water content, redox potential, and salt content all have an effect on the meat.

The salt content in dry-cured ham varies throughout a piece of meat, with gradients determinable through sampling and testing or non-invasively through CT scanning.

=== Wet-cured ===
Wet-cured hams are brined, which involves the immersion of the meat in a brine, sometimes with other ingredients such as sugar also added for flavour. The meat is typically kept in the brine for around 3 to 14 days. Wet curing also has the effect of increasing volume and weight of the finished product, by about 4%.

The wet curing process can also be achieved by pumping the curing solution into the meat. This can be quicker, increase the weight of the finished product by more than immersion, and ensure a more even distribution of salt through the meat. This process is quicker than traditional brining, normally being completed in a few days.

Wet-cured ham is usually cooked, either during processing, or after ageing. A typical example of wet-cured ham made this way is Italian prosciutto cotto. It is first brined, then cooked in a container and finally surface pasteurized. Italian regulations allow it to contain salt, nitrites, sugar, dextrose, fructose, lactose, maltodextrin, milk protein, soy protein, natural or modified starches, spices, gelatin, and flavorings. 

=== Smoking ===
Ham can also be additionally preserved through smoking, in which the meat is placed in a smokehouse (or equivalent) to be cured by the action of smoke.

The main flavor compounds of smoked ham are guaiacol, and its 4-, 5-, and 6-methyl derivatives as well as 2,6-dimethylphenol. These compounds are produced by combustion of lignin, a major constituent of wood used in the smokehouse.

== Labeling ==

In many countries the term is now protected by statute, with a specific definition. For instance, in the United States, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) says that &quot;the word &#x27;ham&#x27;, without any prefix indicating the species of animal from which derived, shall be used in labeling only in connection with the hind legs of swine&quot;.

In addition to the main categories, some processing choices can affect legal labeling. For instance, in the United States, a &quot;smoked&quot; ham must have been smoked by hanging over burning wood chips in a smokehouse or an atomized spray of liquid smoke such that the product appearance is equivalent; a &quot;hickory-smoked&quot; ham must have been smoked using only hickory. However, injecting &quot;smoke flavor&quot; is not legal grounds for claiming the ham was &quot;smoked&quot;; these are labeled &quot;smoke flavor added&quot;. Hams can only be labeled &quot;honey-cured&quot; if honey was at least 50% of the sweetener used, is at least 3% of the formula, and has a discernible effect on flavor. So-called &quot;lean&quot; and &quot;extra lean&quot; hams must adhere to maximum levels of fat and cholesterol per 100 grams of product.

Whole fresh pork leg can be labeled as &quot;fresh ham&quot; in the United States. 

=== Protected designations ===
A number of hams worldwide have some level of protection of their unique characteristics, usually relating to their method of preservation or location of production or processing. Dependent on jurisdiction, rules may prevent any other product being sold with the particular appellation, such as through the European protected geographical indication.

== Uses ==
Ham is typically used in its sliced form, often as a filling for sandwiches and similar foods, such as in the ham sandwich and ham and cheese sandwich. Other variations include toasted sandwiches such as the croque-monsieur and the Cubano. It is also a popular topping for pizza in the United States.

In the United Kingdom, a pork leg cut, either whole or sliced, that has been cured but requires additional cooking is known as gammon. Gammons were traditionally cured before being cut from a side of pork along with bacon. When cooked, gammon is ham. Cooked ham joints are a popular dish around Christmas time, particularly in the Anglosphere and Northern Europe. Gammon can also served as gammon steaks, which are fried or grilled, and served in a similar manner to bacon.

<doc id="14300" wikidata="Q1606981" url="?curid=14300" title="Henry Laurens">
<text>Henry Laurens (December 8, 1792) was an American Founding Father, merchant, slave trader, and rice planter from South Carolina who became a political leader during the Revolutionary War. A delegate to the Second Continental Congress, Laurens succeeded John Hancock as its president. He was a signatory to the Articles of Confederation and, as president, presided over its passage.

Laurens had earned great wealth as a partner in the largest slave-trading house in North America, Austin and Laurens. In the 1750s alone, this Charleston firm oversaw the sale of more than 8,000 enslaved Africans. Laurens served for a time as vice president of South Carolina and as the United States minister to the Netherlands during the Revolutionary War. He was captured at sea by the British and imprisoned for a little more than a year in the Tower of London. His oldest son, John Laurens, was an &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to George Washington and a colonel in the Continental Army.

==Early life and education==
Laurens&#x27;s forebears were Huguenots who fled France after the Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685. His grandfather Andre Laurens left earlier, in 1682, and eventually made his way to America, settling first in New York City and then Charleston, South Carolina. Andre&#x27;s son John married Hester (or Esther) Grasset, also a Huguenot refugee. Henry was their third child and eldest son. John Laurens became a saddler, and his business eventually grew to be the largest of its kind in the colonies.

In 1744, Laurens was sent to London to augment his business training. This took place in the company of Richard Oswald. His father died in 1747, bequeathing a considerable estate to 23-year-old Henry.

==Marriage and family==
Laurens married Eleanor Ball, also of a South Carolina rice planter family, on June 25, 1750. They had thirteen children, many of whom died in infancy or childhood. Eleanor died in 1770, one month after giving birth to their last child. Laurens took their three sons to England for their education, encouraging their oldest, John Laurens, to study law. Instead of completing his studies, John Laurens returned to the United States in 1776 to serve in the American Revolutionary War.

==Political career==

Laurens served in the militia, as did most able-bodied men in his time. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the campaigns against the Cherokee Indians in 1757–1761, during the French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Years&#x27; War).
In 1757, he was elected to South Carolina&#x27;s colonial assembly. Laurens was elected again every year but one until the Revolution replaced the assembly with a state convention as an interim government. The year he missed was 1773, when he visited England to arrange for his sons&#x27; educations. He was named to the colony&#x27;s council in 1764 and 1768 but declined both times. In 1772, he joined the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia and carried on extensive correspondence with other members.

As the American Revolution neared, Laurens was at first inclined to support reconciliation with the British Crown. But as conditions deteriorated, he came to fully support the American position. When Carolina began to create a revolutionary government, Laurens was elected to the Provincial Congress, which first met on January 9, 1775. He was president of the Committee of Safety and presiding officer of that congress from June until March 1776. When South Carolina installed a fully independent government, he served as the vice president of South Carolina from March 1776 to June 27, 1777. Laurens was first named a delegate to the Continental Congress on January 10, 1777. He served in the Congress until 1780. He was the president of the Continental Congress from November 1, 1777, to December 9, 1778.

In the fall of 1779, the Congress named Laurens their minister to the Netherlands. In early 1780, he took up that post and successfully negotiated Dutch support for the war. But on his return voyage to Amsterdam that fall, the British frigate intercepted his ship, the continental packet &quot;Mercury&quot;, off the banks of Newfoundland. Although his dispatches were tossed in the water, they were retrieved by the British, who discovered the draft of a possible U.S.-Dutch treaty prepared in Aix-la-Chapelle in 1778 by William Lee and the Amsterdam banker Jean de Neufville. This prompted Britain to declare war on the Dutch Republic, becoming known as the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War.

The British charged Laurens with treason, transported him to England, and imprisoned him in the Tower of London (he is the only American to have been held prisoner in the tower). His imprisonment was protested by the Americans. In the field, most captives were regarded as prisoners of war, and while conditions were frequently appalling, prisoner exchanges and mail privileges were accepted practice. During his imprisonment, Laurens was assisted by Richard Oswald, his former business partner and the principal owner of Bunce Island, a slave-trading island base in the Sierra Leone River. Oswald argued on Laurens&#x27;s behalf to the British government. Finally, on December 31, 1781, he was released in exchange for General Lord Cornwallis and completed his voyage to Amsterdam. He helped raise funds for the American effort.

Laurens&#x27;s oldest son, Colonel John Laurens, was killed in 1782 in the Battle of the Combahee River, as one of the last casualties of the Revolutionary War. He had supported enlisting and freeing slaves for the war effort and suggested to his father that he begin with the 40 he stood to inherit. He had urged his father to free the family&#x27;s slaves, but although conflicted, Henry Laurens never manumitted his 260 slaves.

In 1783, Laurens was sent to Paris as one of the peace commissioners for the negotiations leading to the Treaty of Paris. While he was not a signatory of the primary treaty, he was instrumental in reaching the secondary accords that resolved issues related to the Netherlands and Spain. Richard Oswald, a former partner of Laurens in the slave trade, was the principal negotiator for the British during the Paris peace talks.

Laurens generally retired from public life in 1784. He was sought for a return to the Continental Congress, the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and the state assembly, but he declined all of these positions. He did serve in the state convention of 1788, where he voted to ratify the United States Constitution.

British forces, during their occupation of Charleston, had burned the Laurens home at Mepkin during the war. When Laurens and his family returned in 1784, they lived in an outbuilding while the great house was rebuilt. He lived on the estate the rest of his life, working to recover the estimated £40,000 that the revolution had cost him (equivalent to about $ in ).

==Death and legacy==
Laurens suffered from gout starting in his 40s and the affliction plagued him throughout the rest of his life. Laurens died on December 8, 1792, at his estate, Mepkin, in South Carolina. In his will he stated he wished to be cremated and his ashes be interred at his estate. It is reported that he was the first Caucasian cremation in the United States, which he chose because of a fear of being buried alive. Afterward, the estate passed through several hands. Large portions of the estate still exist. Part of the original estate was donated to the Roman Catholic Church in 1949 and is now the location of Mepkin Abbey, a monastery of the Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance (Trappist monks).

The city of Laurens, South Carolina, and its county are named for him. The town and the village of Laurens, New York, are named for him. Laurens County, Georgia, is named for his son John. General Lachlan McIntosh, who worked for Laurens as a clerk and became close friends with him, named Fort Laurens in Ohio after him.
