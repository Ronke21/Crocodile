<text>Geocaching (, ) is an outdoor recreational activity, in which participants use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver or mobile device and other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers, called &quot;geocaches&quot; or &quot;caches&quot;, at specific locations marked by coordinates all over the world. The first geocache was placed in 2000, and by 2023 there were over 3 million active caches worldwide.

Geocaching can be considered a real-world, outdoor treasure hunting game. A typical cache is a small waterproof container containing a logbook and sometimes a pen or pencil. The &quot;geocacher&quot; signs the log with their established code name/username and dates it, in order to prove that they found the cache. After signing the log, the cache must be placed back exactly where the person found it. Larger containers such as plastic storage containers (Tupperware or similar) or ammo boxes can also contain items for trading, such as toys or trinkets, usually of more sentimental worth than financial. Geocaching shares many aspects with benchmarking, trigpointing, orienteering, treasure hunting, letterboxing, trail blazing, and another type of location-based game called Munzee.

==History==
Geocaching is similar to the game letterboxing (originating in 1854), which uses clues and references to landmarks embedded in stories. Geocaching was conceived shortly after the removal of Selective Availability from the Global Positioning System on May 2, 2000 (Blue Switch Day), because the improved accuracy of the system allowed for a small container to be specifically placed and located.

The first documented placement of a GPS-located cache took place on May 3, 2000, by Dave Ulmer in Beavercreek, Oregon. The location was posted on the Usenet newsgroup sci.geo.satellite-nav at . Within three days, the cache had been found twice, first by Mike Teague. According to Dave Ulmer&#x27;s message, this cache was a black plastic bucket that was partially buried and contained various items, such as software, videos, books, money, a can of beans, and a slingshot. The geocache and most of its contents were eventually destroyed by a lawn mower, but the can of beans was the only item salvaged and was later turned into a trackable item known as the &quot;Original Can of Beans&quot;. Another geocache and plaque, called the Original Stash Tribute Plaque, now sits at the site.

Geocaching company Groundspeak allows extraterrestrial caches, e.g. the Moon or Mars, although presently, the website provides only earthbound coordinates. The first published extraterrestrial geocache was GC1BE91, which was placed on the International Space Station by Richard Garriott in 2008. It used the Baikonur launch area in Kazakhstan as its position. The original cache contained a Travel Bug (the first geocaching trackable item in space), which stayed on the station until it was brought back to earth in 2013. Due to fire restrictions on board the station, the geocache contained no official paper logbook. As of June 2024, only one confirmed geocacher (on November 17, 2013) has actually found the geocache, although others have claimed to have found it providing varying amounts of evidence. To commemorate the occasion, Groundspeak allowed specialized geocaching events to be published across the world, allowing attendees to obtain a virtual souvenir on their profile.

The second geocaching trackable in space is TB5EFXK which is attached to the SHERLOC calibration target on board the Mars Perseverance Rover, which landed on Mars on 18 February 2021. Geocachers were given the opportunity to virtually discover the trackable after the WATSON camera sent back its first photographs of the calibration target that contained the tracking code number. The code is printed on a prototype helmet visor material that will be used to test how well it can withstand the Martian environment. This will help scientists in creating a viable Martian spacesuit for future crewed missions to Mars. 

The activity was originally referred to as the &quot;GPS stash hunt&quot; or &quot;gpsstashing.&quot; This was changed shortly after the original hide when it was suggested in the gpsstash eGroup that &quot;stash&quot; could have negative connotations and the term &quot;geocaching&quot; was adopted.

Over time, a variety of different hide-and-seek-type activities have been created or abandoned, so that &quot;Geocaching&quot; may now refer to hiding and seeking containers, or locations or information without containers.

An independent accounting of the early history documents several controversial actions taken by Jeremy Irish and Grounded, Inc., a predecessor to Groundspeak, to increase &quot;commercialization and monopolistic control over the hobby&quot;. More recently, other similar hobbies such as Munzee have attracted some geocachers by rapidly adopting smart-phone technology, which has caused &quot;some resistance from geocaching organizers about placing caches along with Munzees&quot;.

==Geocaches==

For the traditional geocache, a geocacher will place a waterproof container containing a log book, often also a pen and/or pencil and trade items or trackables, then record the cache&#x27;s coordinates. These coordinates, along with other details of the location, are posted on a listing site (see list of some sites below). Other geocachers obtain the coordinates from that listing site and seek out the cache using their handheld GPS receivers. The finding geocachers record their exploits in the logbook and online, but then must return the cache to the same coordinates so that other geocachers may find it. Geocachers are free to take objects (except the logbook, pencil, or stamp) from the cache in exchange for leaving something of similar or higher value.

Typical cache &quot;treasures&quot;, also known in the geocaching world as SWAG (a backronym of &quot;stuff we all get&quot;), are not high in monetary value but may hold personal value to the finder. Aside from the logbook, common cache contents are unusual coins or currency, small toys, ornamental buttons, CDs, or books. Although not required, many geocachers decide to leave behind signature items, such as personal geocoins, pins, or craft items, to mark their presence at the cache location. Disposable cameras are popular as they allow for anyone who found the cache to take a picture which can be developed and uploaded to a geocaching web site listed below. Also common are objects that are moved from cache to cache called &quot;hitchhikers&quot;, such as Travel Bugs or geocoins, whose travels may be logged and followed online. Cachers who initially place a Travel Bug or Geocoin(s) often assign specific goals for their trackable items. Examples of goals are to be placed in a certain cache a long distance from home, or to travel to a certain country, or to travel faster and farther than other hitchhikers in a race. Less common trends are site-specific information pages about the historic significance of the site, types of trees, birds in the area or other such information. Higher-value items are occasionally included in geocaches as a reward for the First to Find (called &quot;FTF&quot;), or in locations which are harder to reach.

Dangerous or illegal items, including weapons and drugs, are not allowed and are specifically against the rules of most geocache listing sites. Food is also disallowed, even if sealed, as it is considered unhygienic and can attract animals.

If a geocache has been vandalized or stolen by a person who is not familiar with geocaching, it is said to have been &quot;muggled&quot;. The term plays off the fact that those not familiar with geocaching are called &quot;muggles&quot;, a word borrowed from the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series of books which were rising in popularity at the same time geocaching started.

===Variations===
Geocaches vary in size, difficulty, and location. Simple caches that are placed near a roadside are often called &quot;drive-bys&quot;, &quot;park &#x27;n grabs&quot; (PNGs), or &quot;cache and dash&quot;. Geocaches may also be complex, involving lengthy searches, significant travel, or use of specialist equipment such as SCUBA diving, kayaking, or abseiling. Different geocaching websites list different variations per their own policies.
Container sizes range from &quot;nano&quot;, particularly &quot;magnetic nanos&quot;, which can be smaller than the tip of a finger and have only enough room to store the log sheet, to 20-liter (5 gallon) buckets or even larger containers, such as entire trucks. The most common cache containers in rural areas are lunch-box-sized plastic storage containers or surplus military ammunition cans. Ammo cans are considered the gold standard of containers because they are very sturdy, waterproof, animal- and fire-resistant, and relatively cheap, and have plenty of room for trade items. Smaller containers are more common in urban areas because they can be more easily hidden.

===Geocache types===
Over time many variations of geocaches have developed. Different platforms often have their own rules on which types are allowed or how they are classified. The following cache types are supported by geocaching.com.

====Traditional cache====
The simplest form of a geocache. It consists of a container with a log sheet, and is located at the posted coordinates. Cache containers come in many different sizes.

=====Night cache=====
These caches are intended to be found at night, usually by use of a UV torch.

====Multi-cache====
These caches include at least one stage in addition to the physical final container with a log sheet. The posted coordinates for a multi-cache are the first stage. At each stage, the geocacher gathers information that leads them to the next stage or to the final container. Multi-caches can consist of physical stages (i.e. the first stage contains coordinates for the next stage and so forth) or virtual stages (i.e. the first stage is a historical marker where geocachers have to answer questions to calculate the coordinates to the final physical container).

====Mystery cache====
Also called a &#x27;puzzle cache&#x27;, players might need to solve a puzzle or bring a special tool to reveal the next waypoint or final coordinates. Most often, the final container is not at the posted coordinates which is noted in the cache description. Some puzzles can be easy and involve basic math operations or they can be quite difficult, with some of the more challenging ones requiring a firm understanding of computer programming. Geocaching Toolbox, a website dedicated to create and solve puzzle geocaches, provides a comprehensive list of common puzzle cache ciphers.

There are also some subcategories of the mystery cache, which are normally listed as a Mystery Type, which are listed below.

=====Challenge cache=====
This requires a geocacher to complete a reasonably attainable geocaching-related task before being able to log the cache as a find online. It does not restrict &quot;geocachers&quot; from finding the cache and signing the logbook at anytime. However a geocacher is not allowed to log a find on the geocaching website unless they qualify for the challenge specified in the cache description. Examples include finding a number of caches that meet a category, completing a number of cache finds within a period of time, or finding a cache for every calendar day.

Since 2017, Groundspeak has required new challenges to have a &quot;geochecker&quot; in which users can put their name into an algorithm to see if they qualify without the need of physically checking all of one&#x27;s previous finds. These &quot;geocheckers&quot; can be requested using the ProjectGC forums where volunteers can write and create scripts for specific challenges. Groundspeak also has been more strict into what types of challenges are published. For example, prior to 2017 it was possible to create a challenge cache to find 10 caches that have a food item in the title. Under current guidelines, this is no longer allowed because it restricts geocachers to find specific geocaches. Instead, Groundspeak has encouraged new challenges to be more creative. Acceptable challenges include finding caches in 10 states, finding 100 traditional geocaches, or finding 1000 geocaches with the &quot;wheelchair accessible&quot; attribute.

=====Bonus cache=====
A bonus cache requires the finder to have found an amount of caches, usually by the same hider, before finding the bonus cache. The cache can be any type, however a bonus cache cannot be required for a second bonus cache.

=====Moving or travelling cache=====
These were found at a listed set of coordinates. The finder hides the cache in a different location, and updates the listing, essentially becoming the hider, and the next finder continues the cycle. This cache has been discontinued at geocaching.com and those that have been grandfathered in are solely declining and are being archived.

=====Chirp cache=====
Also known as a wireless beacon cache. This is a Garmin-created innovative on multi-caches using wireless beacon technology. It is a physical game piece, about the size of a half dollar that can be hidden anywhere. Powered by a small battery, it is able to transmit a signal detectable on Garmin devices. The Chirp stores hints, multicache coordinates, counts visitors, and can confirm the cache is nearby. These caches caused considerable discussion and some controversy at Groundspeak, where they were ultimately given a new &quot;attribute&quot;. These types of geocaches can also be listed as a traditional, multi-cache, or letterbox. It is up to the cache owner to designated the cache type for wireless beacon caches.

====Geocaching HQ geocache (GCK25B)====
This is an official geocache located inside the Groundspeak headquarters office in Seattle, Washington. It is technically classified as a separate cache type under mystery caches, with its own unique icon both on the geocaching app and on one&#x27;s profile statistics tab. Since publication in 2004, it has over 20,000 finds as of June 2024.

====Wherigo cache====
A multi-stage cache hunt that uses a Wherigo &quot;cartridge&quot; to guide players to find a physical cache sometime during cartridge play, usually at the end. However, not all Wherigo cartridges incorporate geocaches into gameplay. Wherigo caches are unique to the geocaching.com website. Wherigo is a GPS location-aware software platform initially released in January 2008. Authors can develop self-enclosed story files (called &quot;cartridges&quot;) that are read by the Wherigo player software, installed on either a GPS unit or smartphone. The player and story take advantage of the location information provided by the GPS to trigger in-game events, such as using a virtual object or interacting with characters. Completing an adventure can require reaching different locations and solving puzzles. Cartridges are coded in Lua. Lua may be used directly, but a builder application is usually used. The Wherigo site offers a builder application and a database of adventures free for download, though the builder has remained in its Alpha version since its last release in May 2008. The official player is only available for Pocket PC. A built-in player is available on Garmin Colorado and Oregon GPS models. The Wherigo Foundation was organized in December 2012. The group is composed of all Wherigo application developers who, up until that time, had been acting and developing separately. Their goal is to provide a consistent Wherigo experience across platforms, connect Wherigo applications via an API, and add modern features to the Wherigo platform. While Groundspeak is aware of this project, the company has yet to take a position.

=====Reverse Wherigo=====
An RWIG provides three lines of code composed of 9 digits each that a player can type into the RWIG cartridge. Instead of following a story or interacting with characters, and RWIG gives you the distance to the final cache, but not direction. It requires geocachers to get closer to the final geocache by process of elimination. Once you are within 25 metres, the final coordinates are given to provide a more accurate location for the geocache.

====Letterbox hybrid====
This is a combination of a geocache and a letterbox in the same container. Letterboxes involve a rubber stamp and logbook that are not supposed to be traded and taken instead of tradable items, but letterbox hybrids may or may not include trade items. Letterboxers carry their own stamp with them, to stamp the letterbox&#x27;s logbook and inversely stamp their personal logbook with the letterbox stamp. The letterbox hybrid cache contains the important materials for this. Typically, letterbox hybrid caches are not found at the given coordinates which only act as a starting location. Instead, a series of clues are given as to where to find the cache such as &quot;take a left past the bridge&quot; or &quot;about 25 paces past the big oak tree&quot;.

====Project A.P.E. cache====
Also known as Ape caches, these are a special type of traditional cache that were hidden in conjunction with 20th Century Fox and Groundspeak to promote the 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes. There were 14 APE geocaches placed around the world and each one contained a prop from the film. As of 2023, only 2 APE caches are still active with one near Seattle, Washington (&#x27;Tunnel of Light&#x27;, GC1169) and the other in Brazil (&#x27;Southern Bowl&#x27;, GCC67). Of those two, the Brazil APE cache is the only surviving original APE cache because GC1169 was muggled in 2016. However, the original container was later found by a Groundspeak led survey in April of that year. What remains of &quot;Tunnel of Light&quot; is an &quot;official&quot; replacement of the original ammo can that was left in 2001.

====Virtual cache====
This cache type does not contain a physical logbook. They are normally hidden at a rather interesting or unique location, usually with a described object such as an art sculpture or a scenic lookout. Validation for finding a virtual cache generally requires one to email the cache hider with information such as a date or a name on a plaque, or to post a picture of oneself at the site with a GPS receiver in hand. As of 2005, new virtual caches are no longer allowed by Groundspeak as it is considered a legacy cache.

On August 24, 2017, Groundspeak announced &quot;Virtual Rewards&quot;, allowing 4000 new virtual caches to be placed during the following year. Each year, eligible geocachers can opt-in to a drawing and some selected with the opportunity to submit a virtual cache for publication. From 2005 to 2017, the geocaching website no longer listed new caches without a physical container, including virtual and webcam caches (with the exception of earthcaches and events); however, older caches of these types have been grandfathered.

====EarthCache====
Similar to virtual geocaches, an Earth cache is published not by a local reviewer, but by a volunteer regional reviewer associated with the Geological Society of America. The geocacher usually has to perform a task which teaches an education lesson about the geology of the cache area. Visitors must answer geological questions to complete the cache which can be as simple as describing the color and thickness of layers in an outcrop or can be as complicated as taking measurements of stream velocities or fault offsets. Earthcaches covers geologic topics such as: rock formation, mineralogy, earthquakes, fluvial processes, erosion, volcanology, and planetary science (among others).

====Locationless cache====
Otherwise known as a Reverse cache, a locationless cache is similar to a scavenger hunt. A description is given for something to find, such as a one-room schoolhouse, and the finder locates an example of this object. The finder records the location using their GPS receiver and often takes a picture at the location showing the named object with their GPS receiver. Typically others are not allowed to log that same location as a find.

Since 2005, all locationless caches have been archived and locked, meaning they are unable to be logged. However, with geocaching&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2020 Groundspeak decided to publish a special locationless cache for geocachers to &quot;find&quot; at various Mega- and Giga-Events around the world. The first locationless cache in 15 years (GC8FR0G) required finders to take a picture of themselves with the geocaching mascot, Signal the Frog, at Mega- and Giga-Events during 2020. The cache was made available to log starting 1 January 2020. However, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all planned Mega- and Giga-events were cancelled for the year, including the planned 20th anniversary celebration event in Seattle, Washington. Therefore, Groundspeak decided to extend the deadline to log this geocache through 1 January 2023. With 22,500 finds it is the second most logged geocache in history.

The second published locationless cache since 2005 (GC8NEAT) required visitors to take a photo of them picking up trash and cleaning up their local area. geocachers were able to log this cache from 6 February 2021 through 31 December 2022. It has been logged over 33,500 times and holds the title for the most &quot;found&quot; geocache. On 17 August 2022, Geocaching.com made available the third locationless cache to be logged since 2005 (GC9FAVE). Instead of finding Signal or picking up trash, this cache encouraged geocachers from around the world to share their favorite geocaching story. This geocache was archived and locked on 1 January 2024.

====Webcam cache====
A type of virtual cache whose coordinates provide the location to a public webcam. The finder is required to capture an image of themselves through the webcam for verification of the find. New webcam caches are no longer allowed by Groundspeak as it is a legacy cache. Webcam caches are a category at Waymarking.com.

====Adventure Lab====
A type of virtual cache that typically consists of a set of 5 waypoints, with each waypoint counting as a &quot;cache find&quot;. The waypoints usually have an overall theme such showcasing the history of a small town and are often created as a walking tour of a city or park. An example would be Route 66 or the Lincoln Highway, which are a nationwide series of Adventure Lab sets of 10 that stretch the entire route across the United States.

Adventure labs were first introduced in 2014 as a way to test market ideas through Groundspeak. Initially, geocachers would find a key word at a designated site where they could then enter it onto a website to claim &quot;credit&quot;. Soon after, they were made available to &quot;find&quot; at select Mega-Events. In 2020, Groundspeak released the &quot;Adventure Lab&quot; app, separate from the geocaching app. The app made it possible to enter a geo-fence when, once inside, a question will appear that can be answered either in the form of a written answer or a multiple choice answer. This question can be answered at anytime once activated, however, some Adventure Labs must be completed sequentially implying that one must answer the question to move on to the next waypoint.

Many Adventure Labs caches have a physical bonus cache associated with them that are listed as a &quot;mystery cache&quot;. Coordinates to the bonus cache, if applicable, can be seen in the journal entries once a user has correctly answered the question at a waypoint.

Geocachers can create their own Adventure Lab, but must first opt-in to receive an &quot;Adventure Lab credit&quot; which allows for the creation of 1 set of 5 waypoints, with each of the 5 waypoints counting towards a cache find. If selected, Adventure Labs can be created using the Adventure Lab builder. Adventure Labs, unlike all other geocaches, are not subject to review and are published at will by the creator. However, Adventure Labs can at anytime be archived by Groundspeak if they are in violation of terms of use. For example, placing an Adventure Lab in a place that requires people to pay a fee to visit such as airports or theme parks may get the Adventure permanently removed from the Adventure Lab app.

====Event caches====
There are several kinds of events geocaches. While encouraged, events do not require visitors to sign their name a logbook to prove they attended an event. Attendees of event caches can log that they &#x27;attended&#x27;, which will increment their number of found caches. Event caches can be of the following types:

*Event: An event cache is a gathering of local geocachers or geocaching organizations. The event cache page specifies a time for the event and provides coordinates to its location. Event caches have to be longer than 30 minutes, and can publish no less than 14 days away from the planned event date. Event caches typically last from 1 to 2 hours.
*Cache-In Trash-Out Event (CITO): is an environmental initiative to clean up and preserve the natural areas that geocachers frequent. These events are gatherings of the geocaching community that can focus on services like litter clean-up, removal of invasive species, planting trees and vegetation, and trail building. CITO events must be no less than 2 hours long. Just like event caches, CITOs have to be published no less than 14 days prior to the date of the CITO. CITO typically last from 2 to 4 hours.
*Mega-Event: Just like an event cache, however it has to consist of 500 or more geocachers. Mega events are typically organized by a local geocache organizations in conjunction with local municipalities and promotion from Groundspeak. Often, mega events last an entire day and have various activities planned in the days before, during, and after the main Mega-Event. These activities can range in raffles and silent auctions, of which funds help offset the costs of organizing such an event, photo ops with Signal the Frog, a plethora of new geocaches, and panels with local geocachers, lackeys (Groundspeak employees), and reviewers. Mega-Events often have vendors where people can purchase geocoins, cache containers, and food.
*Giga-Event: Just like an event cache, however it has to consist of 5,000 or more geocachers. Like a Mega-Event, Giga-Events offer a plethora of actives and are typically held in large areas to accommodate such crowds. Activities typically include a GPS Adventures Maze, panels, vendors, live music, and carnival rides. Usually the week before and after are filled with smaller gatherings which attracts geocachers from around the world who often make a vacation out of it. Only one can happen at a time in the world.
*GPS Adventures Maze Exhibit: The GPS Adventures Maze is a traveling exhibit designed to teach people of all ages about GPS technology and geocaching through interactive science experiences. It may accompany a Mega- or Giga-Event. These &quot;events&quot; have their own cache type on geocaching.com and often include many non-geocachers.
*Community Celebration Event (CCE): A type of event that is meant to celebrate the 10th and 20th anniversary of geocaching. First issued in 2010 as &quot;Lost and Found&quot; events, geocachers could host one to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of geocaching. In preparation for the 20th anniversary in 2020, Lost and Found events were rebranded as Community Celebration Events. Geocachers could opt-in to receive a CCE credit to host. Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, Groundspeak allowed CCEs to be hosted until 31 December 2022. Geocaching HQ will be allowing geocachers to host CCEs in 2025, assuming they meet specific criteria.
*Geocaching HQ Block Party: Hosted at Geocaching HQ, a Geocaching HQ Block party is hosted at significant milestones for Geocaching&#x27;s years of existence.

==Technology==

===Obtaining data===
GPX files containing information such as a cache description and information about recent visitors to the cache are available from various listing sites. Geocachers may upload geocache data (also known as waypoints) from various websites in various formats, most commonly in file-type GPX, which uses XML. Some websites allow geocachers to search (build queries) for multiple caches within a geographic area based on criteria such as ZIP code or coordinates, downloading the results as an email attachment on a schedule. In recent years, Android and iPhone users can download apps such as GeoBeagle that allow them to use their 3G and GPS-enabled devices to actively search for and download new caches.

===Converting and filtering data===
A variety of geocaching applications are available for geocache data management, file-type translation, and personalization. Geocaching software can assign special icons or search (filter) for caches based on certain criteria (e.g. distance from an assigned point, difficulty, date last found).

Paperless geocaching means hunting a geocache without a physical printout of the cache description. Traditionally, this means that the seeker has an electronic means of viewing the cache information in the field, such as pre-downloading the information to a PDA or other electronic device. Various applications can directly upload and read GPX files without further conversion. Newer GPS devices released by Garmin, DeLorme, and Magellan have the ability to read GPX files directly, thus eliminating the need for a PDA. Other methods include viewing real-time information on a portable computer with internet access or with an Internet-enabled smart phone. The latest advancement of this practice involves installing dedicated applications on a smart phone with a built-in GPS receiver. Seekers can search for and download caches in their immediate vicinity directly to the application and use the on-board GPS receiver to find the cache.

A more controversial version of paperless Caching involves mass-downloading only the coordinates and cache names (or waypoint IDs) for hundreds of caches into older receivers. This is a common practice of some cachers and has been used successfully for years. In many cases, however, the cache description and hint are never read by the seeker before hunting the cache. This means they are unaware of potential restrictions such as limited hunt times, park open/close times, off-limit areas, and suggested parking locations.

===Mobile devices===
The website geocaching.com now sells mobile applications which allow users to view caches through a variety of different devices. Currently, the Android, iOS, and Windows Phone mobile platforms have applications in their respective stores. The apps also allow for a trial version with limited functionality. The site promotes mobile applications, and lists over two dozen applications (both mobile and browser/desktop based) that are using their proprietary but royalty-free public application programming interface (API). Developers at c:geo have criticised Groundspeak for being incompatible with open-source development.

Additionally, &quot;c:geo - opensource&quot; is a free opensource full function application for Android phones that is very popular. This app includes similar features to the official Geocaching mobile application, such as: View caches on a live map (Google Maps or OpenStreetMap), navigation using a compass, map, or other applications, logging finds online and offline, etc.

Geocaching enthusiasts have also made their own hand-held GPS devices using a Lego Mindstorms NXT GPS sensor.

==Ethics==
Geocache listing websites have their own guidelines for acceptable geocache publications. Government agencies and others responsible for public use of land often publish guidelines for geocaching, and a &quot;Geocacher&#x27;s Creed&quot; posted on the Internet asks participants to &quot;avoid causing disruptions or public alarm&quot;. Generally accepted rules are to not endanger others, to minimize the impact on nature, to respect private property, and to avoid public alarm.

==Reception==
The reception from authorities and the general public outside geocache participants has been mixed.

Cachers have been approached by police and questioned when they were seen as acting suspiciously. Other times, investigation of a cache location after suspicious activity was reported has resulted in police and bomb squad discovery of the geocache, such as the evacuation of a busy street in Wetherby, Yorkshire, England in 2011, and a street in Alvaston, Derby in 2020.

Schools have been evacuated when a cache has been seen by teachers or police, such as the case of Fairview High School in Boulder, Colorado in 2009. A number of caches have been destroyed by bomb squads. Diverse locations, from rural cemeteries to Disneyland, have been locked down as a result of such scares.

The placement of geocaches has occasional critics among some government personnel and the public at large, who consider it littering. Some geocachers act to mitigate this perception by picking up litter while they search for geocaches, a practice referred to in the community as &quot;Cache In Trash Out&quot;. Events and caches are often organized revolving around this practice, with many areas seeing significant cleanup that would otherwise not take place, or would instead require federal, state, or local funds to accomplish. Geocachers are also encouraged to clean up after themselves by retrieving old containers once a cache has been removed from play.

Geocaching is legal in most countries and is usually positively received when explained to law enforcement officials. However, certain types of placements can be problematic. Although generally disallowed, hiders could place caches on private property without adequate permission (intentionally or otherwise), which encourages cache finders to trespass. Historic buildings and structures have also been damaged by geocachers, who have wrongly believed the geocache can be/has been placed within, or on the roof of, the buildings.
Caches might also be hidden in places where the act of searching can make a finder look suspicious (e.g., near schools, children&#x27;s playgrounds, banks, courthouses, or in residential neighborhoods), or where the container placement could be mistaken for a drug stash or a bomb (especially in urban settings, under bridges, near banks, courthouses, or embassies). As a result, geocachers are strongly advised to label their geocaches when possible, so that they are not mistaken for a harmful object if discovered by non-geocachers.
As well as concerns about littering and bomb threats, some geocachers have hidden their caches in inappropriate locations, such as electrical boxes, which may encourage risky behavior, especially by children. Hides in these areas are discouraged, and cache listing websites enforce guidelines that disallow certain types of placements. However, as cache reviewers typically cannot see exactly where and how every cache is hidden, problematic hides can slip through. Ultimately it is also up to cache finders to use discretion when attempting to search for a cache, and report any problems.

===Laws and legislation===
Regional rules for placement of caches have become complex. For example, in Virginia, the Virginia Department of Transportation and the Wildlife Management Agency now forbids the placement of geocaches on all land controlled by those agencies. Some cities, towns, and recreation areas allow geocaches with few or no restrictions, but others require compliance with lengthy permitting procedures.

The South Carolina House of Representatives passed Bill 3777 in 2005, stating, &quot;It is unlawful for a person to engage in the activity of Geocaching or letterboxing in a cemetery or in a historic or archaeological site or property publicly identified by a historical marker without the express written consent of the owner or entity which oversees that cemetery site or property.&quot; The bill was referred to committee on first reading in the Senate and has been there ever since.

The Illinois Department of Natural Resources requires geocachers who wish to place a geocache at any Illinois state park to submit the location on a USGS 7.5 minute topographical map, the name and contact information of the person(s) wishing to place the geocache, a list of the original items to be included in the geocache, and a picture of the container that is to be placed.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the township of Highlands East, Ontario, Canada temporarily banned geocaching, over concerns that geocache containers could not be properly disinfected between finds.

==Notable incidents==

Several deaths have occurred during the course of Caching.

The death of a 21-year-old experienced cacher in December 2011 &quot;while attempting a Groundspeak Cache that does not look all that dangerous&quot; led to discussions of whether changes should be made, and whether cache owners or Groundspeak could be held liable. Groundspeak has since updated their geocaching.com terms of use agreement to specify that geocachers find geocaches at their own risk.

In 2008, two lost hikers on Mount Hood in Oregon, U.S. stumbled across a geocache and phoned this information out to rescuers, allowing crews to locate and rescue them.

Three adult geocachers, a 24-year-old woman and her parents, were trapped in a cave and rescued by firefighters in Rochester, New York, U.S. while searching for a geocache in 2012. Rochester Fire Department spokesman Lt. Ted Kuppinger said, &quot;It&#x27;s difficult, because you&#x27;re invested in it, you want to find something like that, so people will probably try to push themselves more than they should, but you need to be prudent about what you&#x27;re capable of doing.&quot;

In 2015, members of the public called the British coastguard to check on a group of geocachers who were spotted walking into the Severn Estuary off the coast of Clevedon, England, in search of clues to locate a multi-cache. Although they felt they were safe and able to return to land, they were considered to be in danger and were airlifted back to the shore.

In October 2016, four people discovered a crashed car at the bottom of a ravine in Benton County, Washington, U.S., while out geocaching. They spotted the driver still trapped inside and alerted emergency services, who rescued the driver.

On 9 June 2018, four people in Prague, Czech Republic were searching for a cache in a 4 km long tunnel when a storm surge carried them through the tunnel to its terminus at the Vltava river. Two of the geocachers died, while two others were rescued from the river.

==Websites and data ownership==
Numerous websites list geocaches around the world. Geocaching websites vary in many ways, such as subscription options, activity levels, and volunteers available to check and ensure caches registered remain open for others.

===First page===
The first website to list geocaches was announced by Mike Teague on May 8, 2000. On September 2, 2000, Jeremy Irish emailed the gpsstash mailing list that he had registered the domain name geocaching.com and had set up his own Web site. He copied the caches from Mike Teague&#x27;s database into his own. On September 6, Mike Teague announced that Jeremy Irish was taking over cache listings. , Teague had logged only 5 caches.

===Geocaching.com===
The largest site is Geocaching.com, owned by Groundspeak Inc., which began operating in late 2000. With a worldwide membership and a freemium business model, the website claims millions of caches and members in over 190 countries and all seven continents including Antarctica. Hides and events are reviewed by volunteer regional cache reviewers before publication. Free membership allows users access to coordinates, descriptions, and logs for some caches; for a subscription fee, users are allowed additional search tools, the ability to download large amounts of cache information onto their GPS at once, instant email notifications about new caches, and access to premium-member-only caches (although, you can still access such caches on the website itself; the premium cache restriction only applies to the application). Geocaching Headquarters are located in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States.

===Opencaching Network===

The Opencaching Network provides independent, non-commercial listing sites based in the cacher&#x27;s country or region. The Opencaching Network lists the most types of caches, including traditional, virtual, moving, multi, quiz, webcam, BIT, guest book, USB, event, and MP3. The Opencaching Network is less restrictive than many sites, and does not charge for the use of the sites, the service being community-driven. Some (or all) listings may or may not be required to be reviewed by community volunteers before being published and although cross-listing is permitted, it is discouraged. Some listings are listed on other sites, but there are many that are unique to the Opencaching Network. Features include the ability to organize one&#x27;s favourite caches, build custom searches, be instantly notified of new caches in one&#x27;s area, seek and create caches of all types, export GPX queries, statpics, etc. Each Opencaching Node provides the same API for free (called &quot;OKAPI&quot;) for use by developers who want to create third-party applications which can use the Opencaching Network&#x27;s content.

Countries with associated opencaching websites include the United States at www.opencaching.us; Germany at www.opencaching.de; Sweden at www.opencaching.se; Poland at www.opencaching.pl; Czech Republic at www.opencaching.cz; The Netherlands at www.opencaching.nl; Romania at www.opencaching.ro; the United Kingdom at www.opencache.uk.

The main difference between opencaching and traditional listing sites is that all services are open to the users at no cost. Generally, most geocaching services or websites offer some basic information for free, but users may have to pay for premium membership that allows access to more information or advanced searching capabilities. This is not the case with opencaching; every geocache is listed and accessible to everyone for free.

Additionally, Opencaching sites allow users to rate and report on existing geocaches. This allows users to see what other cachers think of the cache and it encourages participants to place higher-quality caches. The rating system also greatly reduces the problem of abandoned or unsatisfactory caches still being listed after repeated negative comments or posts in the cache logs.

===OpenCaching.com===
OpenCaching.com (short: OX) was a site created and run by Garmin from 2010 to 2015, which had the stated aim of being as free and open as possible with no paid content. Caches were approved by a community process and coordinates were available without an account. The service closed on 14 August 2015.

===Other sites===
In many countries there are regional geocaching sites, but these mostly only compile lists of caches in the area from the three main sites. Many of them also accept unique listings of caches for their site; these listings tend to be less popular than the international sites, although occasionally the regional sites may have more caches than the international sites. There are some exceptions, such as how, in the territory of the former Soviet Union, the site Geocaching.su remains popular because it accepts listings in the Cyrillic script. Additional international sites include Geocaching.de, a German website, and Geocaching Australia, which accepts listings of cache types deprecated by geocaching.com, cache types such as TrigPoint and Moveable caches, as well as traditional geocache types.

====GPSgames====
GPSgames.org was an online community dedicated to all kinds of games involving Global Positioning System receivers. GPSgames.org allowed traditional geocaches along with virtual, locationless, and traveler geocaches. 
The site&#x27;s geodashing game generated a large number of randomly positioned &quot;dashpoints&quot;, requiring players to reach as many as possible, competing as individuals or teams.
Shutterspot, GeoVexilla, MinuteWar, GeoPoker, and GeoGolf were among the other GPS games available.

GPSgames.org was 100% free since 2001, through donations. The site was retired on 30 June 2021.

====NaviCache====
Navicache.com started as a regional listing service in 2001. While many of the website&#x27;s listings have been posted to other sites, it also offers unique listings. The website lists nearly any type of geocache and does not charge to access any of the caches listed in its database. All submissions are reviewed and approved. In 2012 it was announced that Navicache was under transition to new owners, who said they &quot;plan to develop a site that geocachers want, with rules that geocachers think are suitable. Geocaching.com and OX are both backed by large enterprises, and while that means they have more funding and people, we&#x27;re a much smaller team – so our advantage is the ability to be dynamic and listen to the users.&quot; However, as of 2021 the site is mostly dormant, and the most recent cache listing is from 2014.

====TerraCaching====
Terracaching.com aims to provide high-quality caches made so by the difficulty of the hide or from the quality of the location. Membership is managed through a sponsorship system, and each cache is under continual peer review from other members. Terracaching.com embraces virtual caches alongside traditional or multi-stage caches and includes many locationless caches among the thousands of caches in its database. It is increasingly attracting members who like the point system. In Europe, TerraCaching is supported by Terracaching.eu. This site is translated in different European languages, has an extended FAQ and extra supporting tools for TerraCaching. TerraCaching strongly discourages caches that are listed on other sites (so-called double-listing).

====Extremcaching====
Extremcaching is a German private database for alternative geocaches with a focus on T5 / climbing caches, night caches, and lost place caches.

====Geocaching Australia====
Geocaching Australia is a community website for geocachers in Australia and New Zealand. Geocaching Australia also has many unique cache types such as Burke And Wills, Moveable_cache &amp; Podcache geocaches.

<text>The geographical mile is an international unit of length determined by 1 minute of arc ( degree) along the Earth&#x27;s equator. For the international ellipsoid 1924 this equalled 1855.4 metres. &quot;The American Practical Navigator&quot; 2017 defines the geographical mile as . Greater precision depends more on the choice of the Earth&#x27;s radius of the used ellipsoid than on more careful measurement, since the radius of the geoid varies more than along the equator. In any ellipsoid, the length of a degree of longitude at the equator is exactly 60 geographical miles. The Earth&#x27;s radius at the equator in the GRS80 ellipsoid is , which makes the geographical mile 1,855.3248 m. The rounding of the Earth&#x27;s radius to metres in GRS80 has an effect of 0.0001 m.

The shape of the Earth is a slightly flattened sphere, which results in the Earth&#x27;s circumference being 0.168% larger when measured around the equator as compared to through the poles. The geographical mile is slightly larger than the nautical mile (which was historically linked to the circumference measured through both poles); one geographic mile is equivalent to approximately .

==Historical units==
Historically, certain nations used slightly different divisions to create their geographical miles.

The Portuguese system derived their miles () as one third of their league of three separate values. When each equatorial degree was divided into 18 leagues, the geographical mile was equal to degree or about ; when divided into 20 leagues, the geographical mile was equal to degree, approximating the values provided above; and when divided into 25 leagues, the geographical mile was equal to degree or about .

The geographical miles of the traditional Dutch (), German ( or ), and Danish systems () all approximated their much longer milesequivalent to English leaguesby using a larger division of the equatorial degree. Instead of using one minute of arc, they all used four degreeto produce a distance now notionally equal to but actually differing slightly depending on official measurements and computations. (For example, the Danish unit was computed as equivalent to about by the astronomer Ole Rømer.) 

==Relationship with the nautical mile==

The geographical mile is closely related to the nautical mile, which was originally determined as 1 minute of arc along a great circle of the Earth but is nowadays defined by treaty as exactly 1,852 m. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology notes that &quot;The international nautical mile of 1,852 meters (6,076.115 49... feet) was adopted effective July 1, 1954, for use in the United States. The value formerly used in the United States was 6,080.20 feet = 1 nautical (geographical or sea) mile.&quot; This deprecated value of 6,080.2 feet is equivalent to . A separate reference identifies the geographic mile as being identical to the international nautical mile of 1,852 m and slightly shorter than the British nautical mile of .

Scandinavians used their own version of the geographical mile as their nautical mile up to the beginning of the 20th century, causing it to be more well known as the sea mile in Danish (), Norwegian (), and Swedish ().

==Use==
The unit is not used much in English-speaking countries but is cited in some United States laws. For example, Section 1301(a) of the Submerged Lands Act defines state seaward boundaries in terms of geographic miles. While debating what became the Land Ordinance of 1785, Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s committee wanted to divide the public lands in the west into &quot;hundreds of ten geographical miles square, each mile containing 6,086 and 4-10ths of a foot&quot; and &quot;sub-divided into lots of one mile square each, or 850 and 4-10ths of an acre&quot;.

<text>Golden Heroes is a British superhero role-playing game that was originally written and published on an amateur basis in 1981, and then republished in a more complete and professional form by Games Workshop in 1984. 

==Description==
&quot;Golden Heroes&quot; is a superhero game not affiliated with any line of comic books (unlike &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot;, for example, which is based on the superheroes found in Marvel Comics.) Because of this, a player has to create their superhero from scratch, not based on a pre-existing superhero. 

The first step in character generation is to randomly determine via dice rolls the character&#x27;s basic attributes of Ego, Strength, Dexterity and Vigor. The dice rolls also determine the character&#x27;s superpowers. There is an opportunity for the player to modify abilities somewhat, but not to change the superpowers. A character can only keep their full set of powers if they can justify them all in a plausible origins story. 

During play, the player must keep track of the superhero&#x27;s private life, what happens during leisure time and the work done while using the hero&#x27;s secret identity. Characters are &quot;rated&quot; after each game and are more likely to succeed in future games if they behave in ways consistent with Comic Book tropes.
==Publication history==
&quot;Golden Heroes&quot; was developed at University of Birmingham by Simon Burley and Peter Haines in 1981, who self-published their manuscript as a 60-page mimeographed book. Burley and Haines shopped the book to Games Workshop, who expanded the material to include Marvel characters in the hopes of acquiring a role-playing game license from Marvel Comics. When Marvel awarded the license to TSR instead, Games Workshop expunged the Marvel content and published the result as &quot;Golden Heroes&quot; in 1984. The box cover art by Alan Craddock is meant look like the cover of an American comic book of the time, complete with a fake bar code and a fake Comics Code Authority approval badge. Interior art was by a plethora of British artists, including Brian Bolland, Kevin Bulmer, Mike Collins, Declan Considine, Alan Davis, Kirk Etienne, Brett Ewins, Jon Glentoran, David Hine, Gary Mayes, and Brendan McCarthy, several of whom were working for the British comic book &quot;2000 AD&quot; at the time.

The following year, Games Workshop published two adventures and one supplement for &quot;Golden Heroes&quot;: 
* &quot;Legacy of Eagles&quot; 
* &quot;Queen Victoria &amp; The Holy Grail&quot;
* &quot;Supervisor&#x27;s Kit&quot;
Games Workshop also published content for the game in their house magazine &quot;White Dwarf&quot;, and produced a line of metal miniatures. 

Twenty years after Games Workshop let the &quot;Golden Heroes&quot; line of products lapse, one of the original creators, Simon Burley, resurrected the game as &quot;Squadron UK&quot; in 2006.

==Reception==
Writing in Issue 62 of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (February 1985), Marcus L. Rowland noted &quot;As a late contender in the super RPG field, &quot;Golden Heroes&quot; faces severe opposition from established games. However, its quality, scope, and the fact that it is orientated towards British players are bound to make it successful, if there is a steady flow of supplements and scenarios.&quot; Rowland concluded by giving the game an overall rating of 10 out of 10.

Pete Tamlyn reviewed &quot;Golden Heroes&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;For younger players, and If you just want the Superhero game for light relief and one-off scenarios, then [&quot;Marvel Superheroes&quot;] is the best, but if you are planning to run an extended Superhero campaign then &quot;Golden Heroes&quot; wins hands down.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan was disappointed in the game, particularly the character generation system, pointing out &quot;basically [the player] is saddled with whatever powers the dice-rolls dictate, no matter how contradictory or silly. Because the random ability system freely mixes useless powers with god-like, there&#x27;s only a remote chance that players will receive [player characters] of comparable talents.&quot; Swan was likewise dismayed by the combat system, calling it &quot;a hodge-podge of weapon classes, target ranges and power grades bordering on the incomprehensible.&quot; Swan also didn&#x27;t like the extensive paperwork required to track a hero&#x27;s private life. Swan concluded by giving the game a below average rating of 2 out of 4, saying, &quot;The rulebooks boast some nice artwork, and the thoughtful referee&#x27;s tips are applicable to any comic-book RPG, but there&#x27;s just not enough substance in &quot;Golden Heroes&quot; to recommend it over the competition.&quot; However, Swan found the two adventures released for &quot;Golden Heroes&quot; to be &quot;surprisingly good, particularly &quot;Queen Victoria &amp; The Holy Grail&quot;, an exciting adventure with supernatural overtones.&quot; 

More than ten years after its publication, Tony Johnston did a retrospective review of &quot;Golden Heroes&quot; for the British games magazine &quot;Arcane&quot;, calling it &quot;A superb system, and one which some referees I know still use today, adapted for other games.&quot; That same year, &quot;Arcane&quot; held a reader poll to determine the fifty most popular role-playing games and &quot;Golden Heroes&quot; was ranked 41st. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: &quot;The gameplay reflects a refined approach to the superhero genre, and roleplaying tends to take priority over combat.&quot;

<text>Guangzhou, previously romanized as Canton or Kwangchow, is the capital and largest city of Guangdong province in southern China. Located on the Pearl River about northwest of Hong Kong and north of Macau, Guangzhou has a history of over 2,200 years and was a major terminus of the Silk Road.

The port of Guangzhou serves as a transportation hub for Guangzhou, one of China&#x27;s three largest cities. Guangzhou was captured by the British during the First Opium War and no longer enjoyed a monopoly after the war; consequently it lost trade to other ports such as Hong Kong and Shanghai, but continued to serve as a major entrepôt. Following the Second Battle of Chuenpi in 1841, the Treaty of Nanking was signed between Sir Robert Peel on behalf of Queen Victoria and Lin Zexu on behalf of Emperor Xuanzong and ceded Hong Kong to the United Kingdom on 26 January 1841 after the agreement of the Convention of Chuenpi.

Guangzhou is at the center of the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area, the most populous built-up metropolitan area in the world, which extends into the neighboring cities of Foshan, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Shenzhen and part of Jiangmen, Huizhou, Zhuhai and Macau, forming the largest urban agglomeration on Earth with approximately 70 million residents and part of the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Administratively, the city holds subprovincial status and is one of China&#x27;s nine National Central Cities. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, nationals of sub-Saharan Africa who had initially settled in the Middle East and Southeast Asia moved in unprecedented numbers to Guangzhou in response to the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis. The domestic migrant population from other provinces of China in Guangzhou was 40% of the city&#x27;s total population in 2008. Guangzhou has one of the most expensive real estate markets in China. As of the 2020 census, the registered population of the city&#x27;s expansive administrative area was 18,676,605 individuals (up 47 percent from the previous census in 2010), of whom 16,492,590 lived in 9 urban districts (all but Conghua and Zengcheng). Due to worldwide travel restrictions at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, the major airport of Guangzhou, briefly became the world&#x27;s busiest airport by passenger traffic in 2020. Guangzhou is the fifth most populous city by urban resident population in China after Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen and Chongqing.

In modern commerce, Guangzhou is best known for its annual Canton Fair, the oldest and largest trade fair in China. For three consecutive years (2013–2015), Forbes ranked Guangzhou as the best commercial city in mainland China. Guangzhou is highly ranked as an Alpha (global first-tier) city together with San Francisco and Stockholm. It is a major Asia-Pacific finance hub, ranking 21st globally in the 2020 Global Financial Centres Index. As an important international city, Guangzhou has hosted numerous international and national sporting events, the most notable being the 2010 Asian Games, the 2010 Asian Para Games, and the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. The city hosts 65 foreign representatives, making it the major city hosting the third most foreign representatives in China, after Beijing and Shanghai. As of 2020, Guangzhou ranked 10th in the world and 5th in China—after Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen—for the number of billionaire residents by the Hurun Global Rich List. Guangzhou is a research and development hub ranking 8th globally as well as 4th in the Asia-Pacific region, and is home to numerous Double First-Class Universities, including Sun Yat-sen University.

== Toponymy ==
 is the official romanization of the Chinese name . The name of the city is taken from the ancient Guǎng Prefecture after it had become the prefecture&#x27;s seat of government. The character or means &#x27;broad&#x27; or &#x27;expansive&#x27;.

Before acquiring its current name, the town was known as Panyu (Punyü; ), a name still borne by one of Guangzhou&#x27;s districts not far from the main city. The origin of the name is still uncertain, with 11 various explanations being offered, including that it may have referred to two local mountains. The city has also sometimes been known as Guangzhou Fu or Guangfu after its status as the capital of a prefecture. From this latter name, Guangzhou was known to medieval Persians such as Al-Masudi and Ibn Khordadbeh as Khanfu (). Under the Southern Han, the city was renamed Xingwang Fu ().

The Chinese abbreviation for Guangzhou is , pronounced in Cantonese and in Mandarin—although the abbreviation on car license plates, as with the rest of the province, is ), after its nickname &quot;City of Rice&quot; (). The city has long borne the nickname () or () from the five stones at the old Temple of the Five Immortals said to have been the sheep or goats ridden by the Taoist culture heroes credited with introducing rice cultivation to the area around the time of the city&#x27;s foundation. The former name &quot;City of the Immortals&quot; (/) came from the same story. The more recent () is usually taken as a simple reference to the area&#x27;s fine greenery.

The English name &quot;Canton&quot; derived from Portuguese , a blend of dialectal pronunciations of &quot;Guangdong&quot; (e.g., Cantonese &quot;Gwong2-dung1&quot;). Although it originally and chiefly applied to the walled city, it was occasionally conflated with Guangdong by some authors. It was adopted as the Postal Map Romanization of Guangzhou, and remained the official name until its name change to &quot;Guangzhou&quot;. As an adjective, it is still used in describing the people, language, cuisine and culture of Guangzhou and the surrounding Liangguang region. The 19th-century name was &quot;&quot;.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===

A settlement now known as Nanwucheng was present in the area by 1100 BC. Some traditional Chinese histories placed Nanwucheng&#x27;s founding during the reign of King Nan of Zhou, emperor of Zhou from 314 to 256 BC. It was said to have consisted of little more than a stockade of bamboo and mud.

=== Nanyue===
Guangzhou, then known as Panyu, was founded on the eastern bank of the Pearl River in 214 BC. Ships commanded by tradespersons arrived on the South China coast in the late antiquity. Surviving records from the Tang dynasty confirm, that the residents of Panyu observed a range of trade missions. Records on foreign trade ships reach upon til the late 20th century.

Panyu was the seat of Qin Empire&#x27;s Nanhai Commandery, and served as a base for the first invasion of the Baiyue lands in southern China. Legendary accounts claimed that the soldiers at Panyu were so vigilant that they did not remove their armor for three years. Upon the fall of the Qin, General Zhao Tuo established the kingdom of Nanyue and made Panyu its capital in 204 BC. It remained independent throughout the Chu-Han Contention, although Zhao negotiated recognition of his independence in exchange for his nominal submission to the Han in 196 BC. Archeological evidence shows that Panyu was an expansive commercial center: in addition to items from central China, archeologists have found remains originating from Southeast Asia, India, and even Africa. Zhao Tuo was succeeded by Zhao Mo and then Zhao Yingqi. Upon Zhao Yingqi&#x27;s death in 115 BC, his younger son Zhao Xing was named as his successor in violation of Chinese primogeniture. By 113 BC, his Chinese mother, the Empress Dowager Jiu () had prevailed upon him to submit Nanyue as a formal part of the Han Empire. The native prime minister Lü Jia () launched a coup, killing Han ambassadors along with the king, his mother, and their supporters. A successful ambush then annihilated a Han force which had been sent to arrest him. Emperor Wu of Han took offense and launched a massive riverine and seaborne war: six armies under Lu Bode and Yang Pu took Panyu and annexed Nanyue by the end of 111 BC.

=== Imperial China ===

Incorporated into the Han dynasty, Panyu became a provincial capital. In AD 226, it became the seat of Guang Prefecture, which gave it its modern name. The &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; described Guangzhou as an important port in southern China. Direct routes connected the Middle East and China, as shown in the records of a Chinese prisoner returning home from Iraq twelve years after his capture at Talas. Relations were often strained: while China was undergoing the An Lushan Rebellion, Arab and Persian pirates sacked the city on 30 October 758 and in revenge thousands of Arabs and Persians were killed by Chinese rebels in the Yangzhou massacre (760). In the Guangzhou massacre about 200,000 Arab, Persian and other foreigners were killed by Chinese rebel Huang Chao in 878, along with the city&#x27;s Jews, Christians, and Parsis. The port was closed for fifty years after its destruction.

Amid the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms that followed the collapse of the Tang dynasty, the Later Liang governor Liu Yan used his base at Panyu to establish a &quot;Great Yue&quot; or &quot;Southern Han&quot; empire, which lasted from 917 to 971. The region enjoyed considerable cultural and economic success in this period. From the 10th to 12th century, there are records that the large foreign communities were not exclusively men, but included &quot;Persian females&quot;. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Guangzhou was as large as three Venices in terms of area, and rivaled all of Italy in the amount of crafts produced. He also noted the large amount of ginger available as well as large geese and snakes. Guangzhou was visited by the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta during his journey around the world in the 14th century. He detailed the process by which the Chinese constructed their large ships in the port&#x27;s shipyards.

Shortly after the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s declaration of the Ming dynasty, he reversed his earlier support of foreign trade and imposed the first of a series of sea bans (). These banned private foreign trade upon penalty of death for the merchant and exile for his family and neighbors. Previous maritime intendancies of Guangzhou, Quanzhou, and Ningbo were closed in 1384 and legal trade became limited to the tribute delegations sent to or by official representatives of foreign governments.

Following the Portuguese conquest of the Melaka Sultanate, Rafael Perestrello traveled to Guangzhou as a passenger on a native junk in 1516. His report induced Fernão Pires de Andrade to sail to the city with eight ships the next year, but De Andrade&#x27;s exploration was understood as spying and his brother Simão and others began attempting to monopolize trade, enslaving Chinese women and children, engaging in piracy, and fortifying the island of Tamão. Rumors even circulated that Portuguese were eating the children. The Guangzhou administration was charged with driving them off: they bested the Portuguese at the Battle of Tunmen and in Xicao Bay; held a diplomatic mission hostage in a failed attempt to pressure the restoration of the sultan of Malacca, who had been accounted a Ming vassal; and, after placing them in cangues and keeping them for most of a year, ultimately executed 23 by lingchi. With the help of local pirates, the &quot;Folangji&quot; then carried out smuggling at Macao, Lampacau, and Island (now Shangchuan), until Leonel de Sousa legalized their trade with bribes to Admiral Wang Bo () and the 1554 Luso-Chinese Accord. The Portuguese undertook not to raise fortifications and to pay customs dues; three years later, after providing the Chinese with assistance suppressing their former pirate allies, the Portuguese were permitted to warehouse their goods at Macau instead of Guangzhou itself.

In October 1646, the Longwu Emperor&#x27;s brother, Zhu Yuyue fled by sea to Guangzhou, the last stronghold of the Ming empire. On December 11, he declared himself the Shaowu Emperor, borrowing his imperial regalia from local theater troupes. He led a successful offense against his cousin Zhu Youlang but was deposed and executed on January 20, 1647, when the Ming turncoat Li Chengdong () sacked the city on behalf of the Qing.

The Qing became somewhat more receptive to foreign trade after gaining control of Taiwan in 1683. The Portuguese from Macau and Spaniards from Manila returned, as did private Muslim, Armenian, and English traders. From 1699 to 1714, the French and British East India Companies sent a ship or two each year; the Austrian Ostend General India Co. arrived in 1717, the Dutch East India Co. in 1729, the Danish Asiatic Co. in 1731, and the Swedish East India Co. the next year. These were joined by the occasional Prussian or Trieste Company vessel. The first independent American ship arrived in 1784, and the first colonial Australian one in 1788. By that time, Guangzhou was one of the world&#x27;s greatest ports, organized under the Canton System. The main exports were tea and porcelain. As a meeting place of merchants from all over the world, Guangzhou became a major contributor to the rise of the modern global economy. Guangzhou is the site of the Thirteen Factories, which were the only legal place to conduct foreign trade with China from 1757 to 1842.

In the 19th century, most of the city&#x27;s buildings were still only one or two stories. However, there were notable exceptions such as the Flower Pagoda of the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees, and the guard tower known as the Five-Story Pagoda. The subsequently urbanized northern hills were bare and covered with traditional graves. The brick city walls were about in circumference, high, and wide. Its eight main gates and two water gates all held guards during the day and were closed at night. The wall rose to incorporate a hill on its northern side and was surrounded on the other three by a moat which, along with the canals, functioned as the city&#x27;s sewer, emptied daily by the river&#x27;s tides. A partition wall with four gates divided the northern &quot;old town&quot; from the southern &quot;new town&quot; closer to the river; the suburb of Xiguan (Saikwan; &quot;West Gate&quot;) stretched beyond and the boats of fishers, traders, and Tanka (&quot;boat people&quot;) almost entirely concealed the riverbank for about . It was common for homes to have a storefront facing the street and to treat their courtyards as a kind of warehouse. The city was part of a network of signal towers so effective that messages could be relayed to Beijing—about away—in less than 24 hours.

The Canton System was maintained until the outbreak of the First Opium War in 1839. Following a series of battles in the Pearl River Delta, the British captured Canton on March 18, 1841. The Second Battle of Canton was fought two months later. Following the Qing&#x27;s 1842 treaty with Great Britain, Guangzhou lost its privileged trade status as more and more treaty ports were opened to more and more countries, usually including extraterritorial enclaves. Amid the decline of Qing prestige and the chaos of the Red Turban Rebellion (1854–1856), the Punti and Hakka waged a series of clan wars from 1855 to 1867 in which one million people died. The foreign trade facilities were destroyed by local Chinese in the Arrow War (1856–1858). The international community relocated to the outskirts and most international trade moved through Shanghai.

The concession for the Guangdong–Hankou Railway was awarded to the American China Development Co. in 1898. It completed its branch line west to Foshan and Sanshui before being engulfed in a diplomatic crisis after a Belgian consortium bought a controlling interest and the Qing subsequently canceled its concession. J.P. Morgan was awarded millions in damages and the line to Wuchang was not completed until 1936 and the completion of a unified Beijing–Guangzhou Railway waited until the completion of Wuhan&#x27;s Yangtze River Bridge in 1957.

=== Modern China===
==== Revolutions====
During the late Qing dynasty, Guangzhou was the site of revolutionary attempts such as the Uprisings of 1895 and 1911 that were the predecessors of the successful Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew the Qing dynasty. The 72 revolutionaries whose bodies were found after the latter uprising are honored as the city&#x27;s 72 Martyrs at the Huanghuagang (&quot;Yellow Flower Mound&quot;) Mausoleum.

==== Republic of China====
After the assassination of Song Jiaoren and Yuan Shikai&#x27;s attempts to remove the Nationalist Party of China from power, the leader of Guangdong Hu Hanmin joined the 1913 Second Revolution against him but was forced to flee to Japan with Sun Yat-sen after its failure. The city came under national spotlight again in 1917, when Prime Minister Duan Qirui&#x27;s abrogation of the constitution triggered the Constitutional Protection Movement. Sun Yat-sen came to head the Guangzhou Military Government supported by the members of the dissolved parliament and the Southwestern warlords. The Guangzhou government fell apart as the warlords withdrew their support. Sun fled to Shanghai in November 1918 until the Guangdong warlord Chen Jiongming restored him in October 1920 during the Yuegui Wars. On June 16, 1922, Sun was ousted in a coup and fled on the warship &quot;Yongfeng&quot; after Chen sided with the Zhili Clique&#x27;s Beijing government. In the following months Sun mounted a counterattack into Guangdong by rallying supporters from Yunnan and Guangxi, and in January established a government in the city for the third time.

From 1923 to 1926, Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang (KMT) used the city as a base to prosecute a renewed revolution in China by conquering the warlords in the north. Although Sun was previously dependent on opportunistic warlords who hosted him in the city, with the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, the KMT developed its own military power to serve its ambition. The Canton years saw the evolution of the KMT into a revolutionary movement with a strong military focus and ideological commitment, setting the tone of the KMT rule of China beyond 1927.

In 1924, the KMT made the momentous decision to ally with the Communist Party and the USSR. With Soviet help, KMT reorganized itself along the Leninist line and adopted a pro-labor and pro-peasant stance. The Kuomintang-CCP cooperation was confirmed in the First Congress of the KMT and the communists were instructed to join the KMT. The allied government set up the Peasant Movement Training Institute in the city, of which Mao Zedong was a director for one term. Sun and his military commander Chiang used Soviet funds and weapons to build an armed force staffed by communist commissars, training its cadres in the Whampoa Military Academy. In August, the fledgling army suppressed the Canton Merchants&#x27; Corps Uprising. The next year the anti-imperialist May Thirtieth Movement swept the country, and the KMT government called for strikes in Canton and Hong Kong. The tensions of the massive strikes and protests led to the Shakee Massacre.

After the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925 the mood was changing in the party toward the communists. In August the left-wing KMT leader Liao Zhongkai was assassinated and the right-wing leader Hu Hanmin, the suspected mastermind, was exiled to the Soviet Union, leaving the pro-communist Wang Jingwei in charge. Opposing communist encroachment, the right-wing Western Hills Group vowed to expel the communists from the KMT. The &quot;Canton Coup&quot; on March 20, 1926, saw Chiang solidify his control over the Nationalists and their army against Wang Jingwei, the party&#x27;s left wing, its Communist allies, and its Soviet advisors. By May, he had ended civilian control of the military and begun his Northern Expedition against the warlords of the north. Its success led to the split of the KMT between Wuhan and Nanking and the purge of the communists in the April 12 Incident. Immediately afterwards Canton joined the purge under the auspice of Li Jishen, resulting in the arrest of communists and the suspension of left wing KMT apparatuses and labor groups. Later in 1927 when Zhang Fakui, a general supportive of the Wuhan faction, seized Canton and installed Wang Jingwei&#x27;s faction in the city, the communists saw an opening and launched the Guangzhou Uprising. Prominent communist military leaders Ye Ting and Ye Jianying led the failed defense of the city. Soon, control of the city reverted to Li Jishen.

Li Jishen was deposed during a war between Chiang and the New Guangxi Clique. By 1929, Chen Jitang had established himself as the powerholder of Guangdong. In 1931 he threw his weight behind the anti-Chiang schism by hosting a separate Nationalist government in Guangzhou. The opposition to Chiang included KMT leaders like Wang Jingwei, Sun Fo and others from diverse factions. The peace negotiations amid the armed standoff led to the 4th National Congress of Kuomintang being held separately by three factions in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Canton. Resigning all his posts, Chiang pulled off a political compromise that reunited all factions. While the intraparty division was resolved, Chen kept his power until he was defeated by Chiang in 1936. During the WW2, the &quot;Canton Operation&quot; subjected the city to Japanese occupation by the end of December 1938.

==== People&#x27;s Republic of China====
Amid the closing months before total Communist victory, Guangzhou briefly served as the capital of the Republican government. Guangzhou was captured on October 14, 1949. Amid a massive exodus to Hong Kong and Macau, defeated Nationalist forces blew up the Haizhu Bridge across the Pearl River in retreat. The Cultural Revolution had a large effect on the city, with many of its temples, churches and other monuments destroyed during this chaotic period.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China initiated building projects including new housing on the banks of the Pearl River to adjust the city&#x27;s boat people to life on land. Since the 1980s, the city&#x27;s close proximity to Hong Kong and Shenzhen and its ties to overseas Chinese made it one of the first beneficiaries of China&#x27;s opening up under Deng Xiaoping. Beneficial tax reforms in the 1990s also helped the city&#x27;s industrialization and economic development.

The municipality was expanded in the year 2000, with Huadu and Panyu joining the city as urban districts and Conghua and Zengcheng as more rural counties. The former districts of Dongshan and Fangcun were abolished in 2005, merged into Yuexiu and Liwan respectively. The city acquired Nansha and Luogang. The former was carved out of Panyu, the latter from parts of Baiyun, Tianhe, Zengcheng, and an exclave within Huangpu. The National People&#x27;s Congress approved a development plan for the Pearl River Delta in January 2009; on March 19 of the same year, the Guangzhou and Foshan municipal governments agreed to establish a framework to merge the two cities. In 2014, Luogang merged into Huangpu and both Conghua and Zengcheng counties were upgraded to districts.

On 16 June 2022 an EF2 tornado struck the city, causing major power outages and knocking out power to the city&#x27;s subway lines.

== Geography==
The old town of Guangzhou was near Baiyun Mountain on the east bank of the Pearl River (Zhujiang) about from its junction with the South China Sea and about below its head of navigation. It commanded the rich alluvial plain of the Pearl River Delta, with its connection to the sea protected at the Humen Strait. The present city spans on both sides of the river from to longitude and to latitude in south-central Guangdong. The Pearl is the 4th-largest river of China. Intertidal ecosystems exist on the tidal flat lining the river estuary, however, many of the tidal flats have been reclaimed for agriculture. Baiyun Mountain is now locally referred to as the city&#x27;s &quot;lung&quot; ().

The elevation of the prefecture generally increases from southwest to northeast, with mountains forming the backbone of the city and the ocean comprising the front. Tiantang Peak is the highest point of elevation at above sea level.

=== Natural resources===
There are 47 different types of minerals and also 820 ore fields in Guangzhou, including 18 large and medium-sized oil deposits. The major minerals are granite, cement limestone, ceramic clay, potassium, albite, salt mine, mirabilite, nepheline, syenite, fluorite, marble, mineral water, and geothermal mineral water. Since Guangzhou is located in the water-rich area of southern China, it has a wide water area with many rivers and water systems, accounting for 10% of the total land area. The rivers and streams improve the landscape and keep the ecological environment of the city stable.

==== Water resources====
The main characteristics of Guangzhou&#x27;s water resources are that there are relatively few local water resources and relatively abundant transit water resources. The city&#x27;s water area is 74,400 hectares, accounting for 10.05% of the city&#x27;s land area. The main rivers include Beijiang, Dongjiang North Mainstream, Zengjiang, Liuxi River, Baini River, Pearl River Guangzhou Reach, Shiqiao Waterway, and Shawan Waterway. Beijiang, The Dongjiang River flows through Guangzhou City and merges with the Pearl River to flow into the sea. The local average total water resources is 7.979 billion cubic meters, including 7.881 billion cubic meters of surface water and 1.487 billion cubic meters of groundwater. Calculated based on the amount of local water resources and the permanent population counted in the sixth census in 2010, there are 1.0601 million cubic meters of water resources per square kilometer, with an average of 628 cubic meters per capita, which is one-half of the country&#x27;s per capita water resources. The amount of water resources for transit passengers is 186.024 billion cubic meters, which is 23 times the total local water resources. The passenger water resources are mainly concentrated in the southern Wanghe District and Zengcheng District. The passenger water resources diverted from the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers into Guangzhou City are 159.15 billion cubic meters, and the passenger water resources diverted from the Dongjiang River into the north mainstream of the Dongjiang River are 14.203 billion cubic meters. meters and the water inflow from the upper reaches of the Zengjiang River is 2.828 billion cubic meters. The southern river network area is in the tidal influence area, with large runoff and a strong tidal effect. The three major entrances of the Pearl River, Humen, Jiaomen, and Hongqili, enter the Lingding Ocean and exit the South China Sea in the south of Guangzhou City. The annual high tide volume is 271 billion cubic meters and the annual ebb tide volume is 408.8 billion cubic meters. The annual runoff of the three major entrances is 137.7 billion cubic meters. Compared with meters, the annual tide can bring a large amount of water, part of which is freshwater resources that can be utilized.

====Biological Resources====
Cultivated crops in Guangzhou have the distinctive characteristics of the transition from the tropics to the subtropics, and it is one of the richest regions in China in terms of fruit tree resources, including three major categories of tropical, subtropical, and temperate zones, 41 families, 82 genera and 174 species, totaling more than 500 varieties (among which there are 55 major varieties of lychee). It is the center of origin and variety of lychee, longan, yellow skin, black (white) olive, and so on. Vegetables are known for their high quality and variety, with 15 major categories, 127 species, and more than 370 varieties. Flowers include fresh cut flowers (fresh cut flowers, fresh cut leaves, fresh cut branches), potted plants (potted flowers, bonsai, flower bed plants), ornamental seedlings, edible and medicinal flowers, industrial and other uses of flowers, lawns, seedlings, etc. More than 3,000 traditional varieties and in recent years the introduction of new varieties, development, and utilization. Grain, cash crops, livestock, poultry, aquatic products, wild animals, and a wide variety of famous and excellent varieties, including Zengcheng Simiao rice is the first protected variety in Guangzhou City to obtain geographical indications.

====Mineral Resources====
The geological structure of Guangzhou City is quite complex, with good conditions for mineralization. Forty-seven kinds of minerals (including subspecies) have been discovered, with 820 mineral sites and 25 large and medium-sized mining areas. The main minerals are granite for construction, limestone for cement, ceramic clay, potassium, sodium feldspar, salt mines, manganese, nepheline orthoclase, fluorite, marble, mineral water, and thermal mineral water. Energy minerals and non-ferrous minerals in the area are in short supply, sporadically distributed, small in scale, and unstable in grade.

=== Climate===
Despite being located just south of the Tropic of Cancer, Guangzhou has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;) influenced by the East Asian monsoon. Summers are wet with high temperatures, high humidity, and a high heat index. Winters are mild and comparatively dry. Guangzhou has a lengthy monsoon season, spanning from April through September. Monthly averages range from in January to in July, while the annual mean is . Autumn, from October to December, is very moderate, cool and windy, and is the best travel time. The relative humidity is approximately 76 percent, whereas annual rainfall in the metropolitan area is over . With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 17 percent in March to 51 percent in October, the city receives 1,559 hours of bright sunshine annually, considerably less than nearby Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Extreme temperatures since 1951 have ranged from on 11 February 1957 and 23 December 1999 to on 1 July 2004, though an unofficial record low of , in which modern meteorologists believe it to be was recorded on 18 January 1893 and for the station that begun records in 1912 located in Huangpu District, an unofficial record low of was recorded on 8 December 1934. The last recorded snowfall in the city was on January 24, 2016, 87 years after the second last recorded snowfall.

== Administrative divisions==

Guangzhou is a sub-provincial city. It has direct jurisdiction over eleven districts:

== Economy==
Guangzhou is the main manufacturing hub of the Pearl River Delta, one of mainland China&#x27;s leading commercial and manufacturing regions. In 2021, its GDP reached ¥2,823 billion (US$444.37 billion in nominal), making it the 2nd largest economy in the South-Central China region after Shenzhen. Guangzhou&#x27;s GDP (nominal) was $444.37 billion in 2021, exceeding that Guangzhou&#x27;s per capita was ¥151,162 ($23,794 in nominal). Guangzhou is considered one of the most prosperous cities in China. Guangzhou ranks 10th in the world and 5th in China (after Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen) in terms of the number of billionaires according to the Hurun Global Rich List 2020. Guangzhou is projected to be among the world top 10 largest cities in terms of nominal GDP in 2035 (together with Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen in China) according to a study by Oxford Economics, and its nominal GDP per capita will reach above $42,000 in 2030. Guangzhou also ranks 21st globally (between Washington, D.C., and Amsterdam) and 8th in the whole Asia &amp; Oceania region (behind Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, Shenzhen and Dubai) in the 2020 Global Financial Centers Index (GFCI). Owing to rapid industrialization, it was once also considered a rather polluted city. After green urban planning was implemented, it is now one of the most livable cities in China.

=== Zhujiang New Town ===

Zhujiang New Town is the central business district of Guangzhou in the 21st century. It covers 6.44 km2 in Tianhe District. Multiple financial institutions are headquartered in this area.
=== Canton Fair===
The Canton Fair, formally the &quot;China Import and Export Fair&quot;, is held every year in April and October by the Ministry of Trade. Inaugurated in the spring of 1957, the fair is a major event for the city. It is the trade fair with the longest history, highest level, and largest scale in China. From the 104th session onwards, the fair moved to the new Guangzhou International Convention and Exhibition Center () in Pazhou, from the older complex in Liuhua. The GICEC is served by two stations on Line 8, one station on Line 11 and three stations on Tram Line THZ1. Since the 104th session, the Canton Fair has been arranged in three phases instead of two phases.

===Business Environment===
Guangzhou is a hub for international businesses. According to an article by China Briefing, over 30,000 foreign-invested companies had settled in Guangzhou by 2018, including 297 Fortune Global 500 companies with projects and 120 Fortune Global 500 companies with headquarters or regional headquarters in the city.

== Demographics==

The 2010 census found Guangzhou&#x27;s population to be 12.78 million. , it was estimated at 13,080,500, with 11,264,800 urban residents. Its population density is thus around 1,800 people per km2. The built-up area of the Guangzhou proper connects directly to several other cities. The built-up area of the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone covers around and has been estimated to house 22 million people, including Guangzhou&#x27;s nine urban districts, Shenzhen (5.36m), Dongguan (3.22m), Zhongshan (3.12m), most of Foshan (2.2m), Jiangmen (1.82m), Zhuhai (890k), and Huizhou&#x27;s Huiyang District (760k). The total population of this agglomeration is over 28 million after including the population of the adjacent Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The area&#x27;s fast-growing economy and high demand for labor has produced a huge &quot;floating population&quot; of migrant workers; thus, up to 10 million migrants reside in the area least six months each year. In 2008, about five million of Guangzhou&#x27;s permanent residents were hukouless migrants.

=== Ethnicity and language===
Most of Guangzhou&#x27;s population is Han Chinese. Almost all Cantonese people speak Cantonese as their first language, while most migrants speak forms of Mandarin. In 2010, each language was the native tongue of roughly half of the city&#x27;s population, although minor but substantial numbers speak other varieties as well. In 2018, He Huifeng of the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; stated that younger residents have increasingly favored using Mandarin instead of Cantonese in their daily lives, causing their Cantonese-speaking grandparents and parents to use Mandarin to communicate with them. He Huifeng stated that factors included local authorities discouraging the use of Cantonese in schools and the rise in prestige of Mandarin-speaking Shenzhen. Jinan University released a survey result of the Guangzhou youths born in the year 2000 or after that were part of this educational study showed that 69% could still speak and understand Cantonese, 20% can understand Cantonese, but unable to speak it, and 11% completely had no knowledge of Cantonese. Jinan University&#x27;s study of these Guangzhou youths also indicated when it came to the daily recreational use of Cantonese, roughly 40%-50% of them participated in these recreational functions with the usage of Cantonese with 51.4% of them in mobile games, 47% in Social Platforms, 44.1% in TV shows, and 39.8% in Books and Newspapers. Despite some decline in the use of Cantonese, it is faring better in survival, popularity, and prestige than other Chinese languages due to the historical pride in the language and culture, as well as the wide popularity and availability of mainstream Cantonese entertainment, which encourages locals to retain the Cantonese language. As of the 2020s, additional renewed efforts were introduced to preserve the local Cantonese language and culture with some limited Cantonese language classes now being taught in some schools as well as hosting Cantonese appreciation cultural events along with hosting activities that cater to the local Cantonese culture and language as well as many local Cantonese speaking families are now placing much stronger emphasis on their children to speak Cantonese to preserve the culture and language. In a 2018 report study by Shan Yunming and Li Sheng, the report showed that 90% of people living in Guangzhou are bilingual in both Cantonese and Mandarin, though fluency will vary depending on if they are locally born to the city and the surrounding Guangdong province or migrants from other provinces, which shows how much importance the Cantonese language still has in the city despite the strict policy rules from the government to be using Mandarin as the country&#x27;s official language. Guangzhou has an even more unbalanced gender ratio than the rest of the country. While most areas of China have 112–120 boys per 100 girls, the Guangdong province that houses Guangzhou has more than 130 boys for every 100 girls.

Guangzhou also possesses a large resident population who are Hakka people. There are seven administrative districts in Guangzhou with a considerable Hakka population: Zengcheng District, Huadu District, Conghua District, Baiyun District, Tianhe District, Yuexiu District and Panyu District. It is estimated that in Zengcheng district and Huadu district of Guangzhou, Hakka speakers account for about 40 percent and a third of the district&#x27;s population.

Recent years have seen a huge influx of migrants, with up to 30 million additional migrants living in the Guangzhou area for at least six months out of every year with the majority being female migrants and many becoming local Guangzhou people. This huge influx of people from other areas, called the floating population, is due to the city&#x27;s fast-growing economy and high labor demands. Guangzhou Mayor Wan Qingliang told an urban planning seminar that Guangzhou is facing a very serious population problem stating that, while the city had 10.33 million registered residents at the time with targets and scales of land use based on this number, the city actually had a population with migrants of nearly 15 million. According to the Guangzhou Academy of Social Sciences researcher Peng Peng, the city is almost at its maximum capacity of just 15 million, which means the city is facing a great strain, mostly due to a high population of unregistered people.

According to the 2000 National Census, marriage is one of the top two reasons for permanent migration and is particularly important for women as 29.3% of the permanent female migrants migrate for marriage [Liang et al., 2004]. Many of the female economic migrants marry men from Guangzhou in hopes of a better life. but like elsewhere in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the household registration system (&quot;hukou&quot;) limits migrants&#x27; access to residences, educational institutions and other public benefits. It has been noted that many women end up in prostitution. In May 2014, legally employed migrants in Guangzhou were permitted to receive a &quot;hukou&quot; card allowing them to marry and obtain permission for their pregnancies in the city, rather than having to return to their official hometowns as previously.

Historically, the Cantonese people have made up a sizable part of the 19th- and 20th-century Chinese diaspora; in fact, many overseas Chinese have ties to Guangzhou. This is particularly true in the United States, Canada, and Australia.

Demographically, the only significant immigration into China has been by overseas Chinese, but Guangzhou sees many foreign tourists, workers, and residents from the usual locations such as the United States. Notably, it is also home to thousands of African immigrants, including people from Nigeria, Somalia, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

=== Metropolitan area===
The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, , a population of 25 million.

===Development of Guangzhou===
Gong et al. 2018 report on the development of Guangzhou from 1990 until 2020, showing how in 1990, the developed residential districts were almost exclusively concentrated in a small part of western Guangzhou whereas other parts of Guangzhou had a smaller limited amount of developed residential communities being overwhelmingly surrounded by agricultural and forest lands. However, from 2005 until 2020, other parts of the city eventually began to develop more so residential communities and in the 2020 map report, it showed fully developed residential communities going from west to east of the city whereas the very southern part and large portions of northern Guangzhou still remain mainly agricultural and forest lands with very limited developed residential communities.

== Transportation==

=== Urban mass transit===
When the first line of the Guangzhou Metro opened in 1997, Guangzhou was the fourth city in Mainland China to have an underground railway system, behind Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Currently the metro network is made up of sixteen lines, covering a total length of . A long-term plan is to make the city&#x27;s metro system expand to over by 2020 with 15 lines in operation. In addition to the metro system there is also the Haizhu Tram line which opened on December 31, 2014.

The Guangzhou Bus Rapid Transit (GBRT) system which was introduced in 2010 along Zhongshan Road. It has several connections to the metro and is the world&#x27;s 2nd-largest bus rapid transit system with 1,000,000 passenger trips daily. It handles 26,900 pphpd during the peak hour a capacity second only to the TransMilenio BRT system in Bogota. The system averages one bus every 10 seconds or 350 per hour in a single direction and contains the world&#x27;s longest BRT stations—around including bridges.

=== Motor transport===
In the 19th century, the city already had over 600 long, straight streets; these were mostly paved but still very narrow. In June 1919, work began on demolishing the city wall to make way for wider streets and the development of tramways. The demolition took three years in total.

In 2009, it was reported that all 9,424 buses and 17,695 taxis in Guangzhou would be operating on LPG-fuel by 2010 to promote clean energy for transport and improve the environment ahead of the 2010 Asian Games which were held in the city. At present, Guangzhou is the city that uses the most LPG-fueled vehicles in the world, and at the end of 2006, 6,500 buses and 16,000 taxis were using LPG, taking up 85 percent of all buses and taxis

Effective January 1, 2007, the municipal government banned motorcycles in Guangdong&#x27;s urban areas. Motorcycles found violating the ban are confiscated. The Guangzhou traffic bureau claimed to have reported reduced traffic problems and accidents in the downtown area since the ban.

=== Airports===

Guangzhou&#x27;s main airport is the Baiyun International Airport in Baiyun District; it opened on August 5, 2004. This airport is the second busiest airport in terms of traffic movements in China. It replaced the old Baiyun International Airport, which was very close to the city center but failed to meet the city&#x27;s rapidly growing air traffic demand. The old Baiyun International Airport was in operation for 72 years. Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport now has three runways, with two more planned. Terminal 2 opened on April 26, 2018. Another airport located in Zengcheng District is under planning.

Guangzhou is also served by Hong Kong International Airport; ticketed passengers can take ferries from the Lianhuashan Ferry Terminal and Nansha Ferry Port in Nansha District to the HKIA Skypier. There are also coach bus services connecting Guangzhou with HKIA.

=== Rail===
Guangzhou is the terminus of the Beijing–Guangzhou, Guangzhou–Shenzhen, Guangzhou–Maoming and Guangzhou–Meizhou–Shantou conventional speed railways. In late 2009, the Wuhan–Guangzhou high-speed railway started service, with multiple unit trains covering at a top speed of . In December 2014, the Guiyang–Guangzhou high-speed railway and Nanning-Guangzhou railway began service with trains running at top speeds of and , respectively. The Guangdong Through Train departs from the Guangzhou East railway station and arrives at the Hung Hom station in Kowloon, Hong Kong. The route is approximately in length and the ride takes less than two hours. Frequent coach services are also provided with coaches departing every day from different locations (mostly major hotels) around the city. A number of regional railways radiating from Guangzhou started operating such as the Guangzhou–Zhuhai intercity railway and the Guangzhou-Foshan-Zhaoqing intercity railway.

=== Water transport===
There are daily high-speed catamaran services between Nansha Ferry Terminal and Lianhua Shan Ferry Terminal in Guangzhou and the Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal, as well as between Nansha Ferry Terminal and Macau Ferry Pier in Hong Kong.
== Culture==

Guangzhou&#x27;s culture is mainly Cantonese culture, which is a subset of the larger &quot;Southern&quot; or the &quot;Lingnan&quot; culture, followed by Hakka culture. Notable aspects of Cantonese cultural heritage include:

*Cantonese language, the local and prestige variant of Yue Chinese.
*Cantonese cuisine, one of China&#x27;s eight major culinary traditions.
*Cantonese opera, usually divided into martial and literary performances.
*Xiguan (Saikwan), the area west of the former walled city.

The Guangzhou Opera House and Symphony Orchestra also perform classical Western music and Chinese compositions in their style. Cantonese music is a traditional style of Chinese instrumental music, while Cantopop is the local form of pop music and rock-and-roll which developed from neighboring Hong Kong.

Cantonese language, Cantonese cuisine and Cantonese opera are the shared culture of the whole Guangdong region, not just the important cultural components of Guangzhou city. With a population of diverse background, the culture of Guangzhou also includes other categories, such as Hakka culture and language.

In the Hakka people inhabited areas of Guangzhou, Hakka culture has been well developed and preserved, and in the long history, the integration of Canton culture and Hakka culture has derived new cultural characteristics. Zengcheng, Guangzhou is a district with a history of more than 1800 years, with the harmonious coexistence of Canton culture and Hakka culture, the derived food culture has not only the non-heritage food such as Zhengguo Wonton, Lanxi Rice Noodle, and Goose Soup, but also the special food such as Yuecun Dace Fish Skin, Paitan Roasted Chicken, and Shitan Whole Cattle Banquet.

=== Religions===
Before the postmodern era, Guangzhou had about 124 religious pavilions, halls, and temples. Today, in addition to the Buddhist Association, Guangzhou also has a Taoist Association, a Jewish community, as well as a history with Christianity, reintroduced to China by colonial powers.

==== Taoism====
Taoism and Chinese folk religion are still represented at a few of the city&#x27;s temples. Among the most important is the Temple of the Five Immortals, dedicated to the Five Immortals credited with introducing rice cultivation at the foundation of the city. The five rams they rode were supposed to have turned into stones upon their departure and gave the city several of its nicknames. However, the temple has not been restored as a Taoist temple status yet. Other famous temples include the City God Temple of Guangzhou and Sanyuan Palace. During the Cultural Revolution, all Taoist temples and shrines were practically destroyed or damaged by the red guards. Only a handful of them like Sanyuan Palace were restored during the 1980s. Guangzhou, like most of southern China, is also notably observant and continues the practice of Chinese ancestral worship during major festive occasions like the Qing Ming Festival and Zhong Yuan Festival.

==== Buddhism====
Buddhism is the most prominent religion in Guangzhou. The Zhizhi Temple was founded in AD 233 from the estate of a Wu official; it is said to comprise the residence of Zhao Jiande, the last of the Nanyue kings, and has been known as the Guangxiao Temple (&quot;Temple of Bright Filial Piety&quot;) since the Ming dynasty. The Buddhist missionary monk, Bodhidharma is traditionally said to have visited Panyu during the Liu Song or Liang dynasty (5th or 6th century). Around AD 520, Emperor Wu of the Liang ordered the construction of the Baozhuangyan Temple and the Xilai Monastery to store the relics of Cambodian Buddhist saints which had been brought to the city and to house the monks beginning to assemble there. The Baozhuangyan is now known as the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees, after a famous poem composed by Su Shi after a visit during the Northern Song. The Xilai Monastery was renamed as the Hualin Temple (&quot;Flowery Forest Temple&quot;) after its reconstruction during the Qing dynasty.

The temples were badly damaged by both the Republican campaign to &quot;Promote Education with Temple Property&quot; () and the PRC&#x27;s Cultural Revolution but have been renovated since the opening up that began in the 1980s. The Ocean Banner Temple on Henan Island, once famous in the west as the only tourist spot in Guangzhou accessible to foreigners, has been reopened as the Hoi Tong Monastery.

==== Christianity====
Nestorian Christians first arrived in China via the overland Silk Road, but suffered during Emperor Wuzong&#x27;s 845 persecution and were essentially extinct by the year 1000. The Qing-era ban on foreigners limited missionaries until it was abolished following the First Opium War, although the Protestant Robert Morrison was able to perform some work through his service with the British factory. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Guangzhou is housed at Guangzhou&#x27;s Sacred Heart Cathedral, known locally as the &quot;Stone House&quot;. A Gothic Revival edifice which was built by hand from 1861 to 1888 under French direction, its original Latin and French stained-glass windows were destroyed during the wars and amid the Cultural Revolution; they have since been replaced by English ones. The Canton Christian College (1888) and Hackett Medical College for Women (1902) were both founded by missionaries, they were known in Chinese as Lingnan University and later incorporated into Sun Yat-sen University. Since the opening up of China in the 1980s, there has been renewed interest in Christianity, but Guangzhou maintains pressure on underground churches which avoid registration with government officials. The Catholic archbishop Dominic Tang was imprisoned without trial for 22 years; however, his present successor is recognized by both the Vatican and China&#x27;s Patriotic Church.

==== Islam====
Guangzhou has had ties with the Islamic world since the Tang dynasty. Relations were often strained: Arab and Persian pirates sacked the city on October 30, 758; the port was subsequently closed for fifty years. Their presence came to an end under the revenge of Chinese rebel Huang Chao in 878, along with that of the Jews, Christians, and Parsis. Nowadays, the city is home to halal restaurants.

<doc id="12539" wikidata="Q146233" url="?curid=12539" title="Genitive case">
<text>In grammar, the genitive case (abbreviated ) is the grammatical case that marks a word, usually a noun, as modifying another word, also usually a noun—thus indicating an attributive relationship of one noun to the other noun. A genitive can also serve purposes indicating other relationships. For example, some verbs may feature arguments in the genitive case; and the genitive case may also have adverbial uses (see adverbial genitive).

The genitive construction includes the genitive case, but is a broader category. Placing a modifying noun in the genitive case is one way of indicating that it is related to a head noun, in a genitive construction. However, there are other ways to indicate a genitive construction. For example, many Afroasiatic languages place the head noun (rather than the modifying noun) in the construct state.

Possessive grammatical constructions, including the possessive case, may be regarded as subsets of the genitive construction. For example, the genitive construction &quot;pack of dogs” is similar, but not identical in meaning to the possessive case &quot;dogs&#x27; pack&quot; (and neither of these is entirely interchangeable with &quot;dog pack&quot;, which is neither genitive nor possessive). Modern English is an example of a language that has a possessive case rather than a &quot;conventional&quot; genitive case. That is, Modern English indicates a genitive construction with either the possessive clitic suffix &quot;-&quot;, or a prepositional genitive construction such as &quot;x of y&quot;. However, some irregular English pronouns do have possessive forms which may more commonly be described as genitive (see English possessive). The names of the astronomical constellations have genitive forms which are used in star names, for example the star Mintaka in the constellation Orion (genitive Orionis) is also known as Delta Orionis or 34 Orionis.

Many languages have a genitive case, including Albanian, Arabic, Armenian, Basque, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, Georgian, German, Greek, Gothic, Hungarian, Icelandic, Irish, Kannada, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malayalam, Nepali, Romanian, Sanskrit, Scottish Gaelic, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, all Slavic languages except Macedonian, and most of the Turkic languages.

==Functions==
Depending on the language, specific varieties of genitive-noun–main-noun relationships may include:
* possession (&quot;see&quot; possessive case, possessed case):
** inalienable possession (&quot;&quot;Janet&#x27;s&quot; height&quot;, &quot;&quot;Janet&#x27;s&quot; existence&quot;, &quot;&quot;Janet&#x27;s&quot; long fingers&quot;)
** alienable possession (&quot;&quot;Janet&#x27;s&quot; jacket&quot;, &quot;&quot;Janet&#x27;s&quot; drink&quot;)
** relationship indicated by the noun being modified (&quot;&quot;Janet&#x27;s&quot; husband&quot;)
* composition (&quot;see&quot; Partitive):
** substance (&quot;a wheel &quot;of cheese&quot;&quot;)
** elements (&quot;a group &quot;of men&quot;&quot;)
** source (&quot;a portion &quot;of the food&quot;&quot;)
* participation in an action:
** as an agent (&quot;She benefited from &quot;her father&#x27;s&quot; love&quot;) – this is called the &quot;subjective genitive&quot; (Compare &quot;Her father loved her&quot;, where &quot;Her father&quot; is the &quot;subject&quot;.)
** as a patient (&quot;the love &quot;of music&quot;&quot;)  – this is called the &quot;objective genitive&quot; (Compare &quot;She loves music&quot;, where &quot;music&quot; is the &quot;object&quot;.)
* origin (&quot;men &quot;of Rome&quot;&quot;)
* reference (&quot;the capital &quot;of the Republic&quot; or &quot;the Republic&#x27;s&quot; capital&quot;)
* description (&quot;man &quot;of honour&quot;&quot;, &quot;day &quot;of reckoning&quot;)
* compounds (&quot;dooms&quot;day&quot; (&quot;doom&#x27;s day&quot;), Scottish Gaelic &quot;ball coise&quot; = &quot;football&quot;, where &quot;&quot;coise&quot; = gen. of &quot;cas&quot;&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;)
* apposition (the city of Rome)
Depending on the language, some of the relationships mentioned above have their own distinct cases different from the genitive.

Possessive pronouns are distinct pronouns, found in Indo-European languages such as English, that function like pronouns inflected in the genitive. They are considered separate pronouns if contrasting to languages where pronouns are regularly inflected in the genitive. For example, English &quot;my&quot; is either a separate possessive adjective or an irregular genitive of &quot;I&quot;, while in Finnish, for example, &quot;minun&quot; is regularly agglutinated from &quot;minu-&quot; &quot;I&quot; and &quot;-n&quot; (genitive).

In some languages, nouns in the genitive case also agree in case with the nouns they modify (that is, it is marked for two cases). This phenomenon is called suffixaufnahme.

In some languages, nouns in the genitive case may be found in inclusio – that is, between the main noun&#x27;s article and the noun itself.

== English ==
Old English had a genitive case, which has left its mark in modern English in the form of the possessive ending &quot;&#x27;s&quot; (now sometimes referred to as the &quot;Saxon genitive&quot;), as well as possessive adjective forms such as &quot;his&quot;, &quot;their&quot;, etc., and in certain words derived from adverbial genitives such as &quot;once&quot; and &quot;afterwards&quot;. (Other Old English case markers have generally disappeared completely.) The modern English possessive forms are not normally considered to represent a grammatical case, although they are sometimes referred to as genitives or as belonging to a possessive case. One of the reasons that the status of &quot;″s&quot; as a case ending is often rejected is that it does not behave as such, but rather as a clitic marking that indicates that a dependency relationship exists between phrases. One can say &quot;the King&#x27;s war&quot;, but also &quot;the King of France&#x27;s war&quot;, where the genitive marker is attached to the full noun phrase &quot;the King of France&quot;, whereas case markers are normally attached to the head of a phrase.
In languages having a true genitive case, such as Old English, this example may be expressed as &quot;þes cynges wyrre of France&quot;, literally &quot;the King&#x27;s war of France&quot;, with the &quot;″s&quot; attaching to &quot;the King&quot;.

==Finnic genitives and accusatives==
Finnic languages (Finnish, Estonian, etc.) have genitive cases.

In Finnish, prototypically the genitive is marked with &quot;-n&quot;, e.g. &quot;maa – maan&quot; &quot;country – of the country&quot;. The stem may change, however, with consonant gradation and other reasons. For example, in certain words ending in consonants, &quot;-e-&quot; is added, e.g. &quot;mies – miehen&quot; &quot;man – of the man&quot;, and in some, but not all words ending in &quot;-i&quot;, the &quot;-i&quot; is changed to an &quot;-e-&quot;, to give &quot;-en&quot;, e.g. &quot;lumi – lumen&quot; &quot;snow – of the snow&quot;. The genitive is used extensively, with animate and inanimate possessors. In addition to the genitive, there is also a partitive case (marked &quot;-ta/-tä&quot; or &quot;-a/-ä&quot;) used for expressing that something is a part of a larger mass, e.g. &quot;joukko miehiä&quot; &quot;a group of men&quot;.

In Estonian, the genitive marker &quot;-n&quot; has elided with respect to Finnish. Thus, the genitive always ends with a vowel, and the singular genitive is sometimes (in a subset of words ending with a vocal in nominative) identical in form to nominative.

In Finnish, in addition to the uses mentioned above, there is a construct where the genitive is used to mark a surname. For example, &quot;Juhani Virtanen&quot; can be also expressed &quot;Virtasen Juhani&quot; (&quot;Juhani of the Virtanens&quot;).

A complication in Finnic languages is that the accusative case &quot;-(e)n&quot; is homophonic to the genitive case. This case does not indicate possession, but is a syntactic marker for the object, additionally indicating that the action is telic (completed). In Estonian, it is often said that only a &quot;genitive&quot; exists. However, the cases have completely different functions, and the form of the accusative has developed from *&quot;-(e)m&quot;. (The same sound change has developed into a synchronic mutation of a final &quot;m&quot; into &quot;n&quot; in Finnish, e.g. genitive &quot;sydämen&quot; vs. nominative &quot;sydän&quot;.) This homophony has exceptions in Finnish, where a separate accusative &quot;-(e)t&quot; is found in pronouns, e.g. &quot;kenet&quot; &quot;who (telic object)&quot;, vs. &quot;kenen&quot; &quot;whose&quot;.

A difference is also observed in some of the related Sámi languages, where the pronouns and the plural of nouns in the genitive and accusative are easily distinguishable from each other, e.g., &quot;kuä&#x27;cǩǩmi&quot; &quot;eagles&#x27; (genitive plural)&quot; and &quot;kuä&#x27;cǩǩmid&quot; &quot;eagles (accusative plural)&quot; in Skolt Sami.

==German==
=== Formation ===

==== Articles ====
The genitive singular definite article for masculine and neuter nouns is , while the feminine and plural definite article is . The indefinite articles are for masculine and neuter nouns, and for feminine and plural nouns (although the bare form cannot be used in the plural, it manifests in , , etc.)

==== Nouns ====
Singular masculine and neuter nouns of the strong declension in the genitive case are marked with . Generally, one-syllable nouns favour the ending, and it is obligatory with nouns ending with a sibilant such as or . Otherwise, a simple ending is usual. Feminine and plural nouns remain uninflected:
* (of the contribution) – masculine
* (of the flower) – feminine
* (of the country) – neuter
* (of the trees) – plural
Singular masculine nouns (and one neuter noun) of the weak declension are marked with an (or rarely ) ending in the genitive case:
* (of the raven) – masculine
* (of the heart) – neuter

==== Adjectives ====
The declension of adjectives in the genitive case is as follows:
==== Personal pronouns ====
The genitive personal pronouns are quite rare and either very formal, literary or outdated. They are as follows (with comparison to the nominative pronouns):

Some examples:
* (Would you go instead &quot;of me&quot;?)
* (We are not worthy &quot;of her/them&quot;)
* (I will commemorate &quot;you&quot;)

==== Relative pronouns ====
Unlike the personal ones, the genitive relative pronouns are in regular use and are as follows (with comparison to the nominative relative pronouns):

Some examples:
* (Do you know the student &quot;whose&quot; mother is a witch?) – masculine
* (She is the woman &quot;whose&quot; husband is a racer) – feminine

=== Usage ===

==== Nouns ====
The genitive case is often used to show possession or the relation between nouns:
* (the colour &quot;of the&quot; &quot;sky&quot;)
* (Germany lies in the heart &quot;of Europe&quot;)
* (the death &quot;of his wife&quot;)
* (the development &quot;of these countries&quot;)
A simple is added to the end of a name:
* (&quot;Claudia&#x27;s&quot; book)

==== Prepositions ====
The genitive case is also commonly found after certain prepositions:
* (within &quot;a day&quot;)
* (instead &quot;of the shirt&quot;)
* (during &quot;our absence&quot;)
* (beyond &quot;the mountains&quot;)

==== Adjectives ====
The genitive case can sometimes be found in connection with certain adjectives:
* (We are aware &quot;of that&quot;)
* (He is guilty &quot;of theft&quot;)
* (The child is in need &quot;of calmness&quot;)
* (I am growing weary &quot;of this life&quot;)

==== Verbs ====
The genitive case is occasionally found in connection with certain verbs (some of which require an accusative before the genitive); they are mostly either formal or legal:
* (The city enjoys &quot;a favourable climate&quot;)
* (Remember &quot;those who died&quot; in (the) war)
* (Who accused him &quot;of murder&quot;?)
* (Someone suspects you &quot;of (committing) fraud&quot;)

==Greek==
The ablative case of Indo-European was absorbed into the genitive in Classical Greek. This added to the usages of the &quot;genitive proper&quot;, the usages of the &quot;ablatival genitive&quot;. The genitive occurs with verbs, adjectives, adverbs and prepositions.
See also Genitive absolute.

==Hungarian==
The Hungarian genitive is constructed using the suffix &quot;-é&quot;.
*&quot;madár&quot; (&#x27;bird&#x27;); &quot;madáré&quot; (&#x27;bird&#x27;s&#x27;)

The genitive &quot;-é&quot; suffix is only used with the predicate of a sentence: it serves the role of mine, yours, hers, etc. The possessed object is left in the nominative case. For example:
*&quot;A csőr a madáré&quot; (&#x27;The beak is the bird&#x27;s&#x27;).

If the possessor is not the predicate of the sentence, the genitive is not used. Instead, the possessive suffixes (&quot;-(j)e&quot; or &quot;-(j)a&quot; in the third person singular, depending on vowel harmony) mark the possessed object. The possessor is left in the nominative if it directly precedes the possessed object (otherwise it takes a dative &quot;-nak/-nek&quot; suffix). For example: 
*&quot;csőr&quot; (&#x27;beak&#x27;); &quot;csőre&quot; (&#x27;its beak&#x27;)
*&quot;a madár csőre&quot;/&quot;csőre a madárnak&quot; (&#x27;the bird&#x27;s beak&#x27;)

In addition, the suffix &quot;-i&quot; (&#x27;of&#x27;) is also used. For example:
*&quot;madár&quot; (&#x27;bird&#x27;); &quot;madári&quot; (&#x27;avian&#x27;, &#x27;of bird(s)&#x27;)

==Japanese==
Japanese construes the genitive by using the grammatical particle &quot;no&quot; の. It can be used to show a number of relationships to the head noun. For example:
:猫の手 &quot;neko-no te&quot; (&quot;cat&#x27;s paw&quot;)
:学生の一人 &quot;gakusei-no hitori&quot; (&quot;one of the students)
:金の指輪 &quot;kin-no yubiwa&quot; (&quot;a ring of gold&quot;)
:京都のどこ &quot;Kyouto-no doko&quot; (&quot;where of (in) Kyoto&quot;)
:富士の山 &quot;Fuji-no yama&quot; (&quot;the mountain of Fuji&quot; [Mt. Fuji])
The archaic genitive case particle &quot;-ga&quot; ～が is still retained in certain expressions, place names, and dialects. Possessive &quot;ga&quot; can also be written as a small ke (), for example in .

Typically, languages have nominative case nouns converting into genitive case. It has been found, however, that the Kansai dialect of Japanese will in rare cases allow accusative case to convert to genitive, if specific conditions are met in the clause in which the conversion appears. This is referred to as &quot;Accusative-Genitive conversion.&quot;

==Latin==
The genitive is one of the cases of nouns and pronouns in Latin. Latin genitives still have certain modern scientific uses:
*Scientific names of living things sometimes contain genitives, as in the plant name &quot;Buddleja davidii&quot;, meaning &quot;David&#x27;s buddleia&quot;. Here &quot;davidii&quot; is the genitive of &quot;Davidius&quot;, a Latinized version of the Hebrew name. It is not capitalized because it is the second part of a binomial name.
*Names of astronomical constellations are Latin, and the genitives of their names are used in naming objects in those constellations, as in the Bayer designation of stars. For example, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo is called &quot;Alpha Virginis&quot;, which is to say &quot;Alpha of Virgo&quot;, as &quot;virginis&quot; is the genitive of &quot;virgō&quot;. Plural forms and adjectives also decline accordingly: plural &quot;Alpha Piscium&quot; (Pisces) and &quot;Alpha Canum Venaticorum&quot; (Canes Venatici) versus singular &quot;Alpha Piscis Austrini&quot; (Piscis Austrinus) and &quot;Alpha Canis Majoris&quot; (Canis Major). Astronomy manuals often list the genitive forms, as some are easy to get wrong even with a basic knowledge of Latin, e.g. Vela, which is a neuter plural not a feminine singular: &quot;Delta Velorum&quot; not *&quot;Delta Velae&quot;.
* &quot;Modus operandi&quot;, which can be translated to English as &quot;mode of operation&quot;, in which &quot;operandi&quot; is a singular genitive gerund (i.e. &quot;of operation&quot;), not a plural of &quot;operandus&quot; as is sometimes mistakenly assumed.

==Irish==

The Irish language also uses a genitive case (&quot;tuiseal ginideach&quot;). For example, in the phrase &quot;bean an tí&quot; (woman of the house), &quot;tí&quot; is the genitive case of &quot;teach&quot;, meaning &quot;house&quot;. Another example is &quot;barr an chnoic&quot;, &quot;top of the hill&quot;, where &quot;cnoc&quot; means &quot;hill&quot;, but is changed to &quot;chnoic&quot;, which also incorporates lenition.

==Mandarin==
In Mandarin Chinese, the genitive case is made by use of the particle 的 (de).

However, about persons in relation to oneself, 的 is often dropped when the context allows for it to be easily understood.

==Persian==

Old Persian had a true genitive case inherited from Proto-Indo-European. By the time of Middle Persian, the genitive case had been lost and replaced by an analytical construction which is now called Ezāfe. This construction was inherited by New Persian, and was also later borrowed into numerous other Iranic, Turkic and Indo-Aryan languages of Western and South Asia.

==Semitic languages==

Genitive case marking existed in Proto-Semitic, Akkadian, and Ugaritic. It indicated possession, and it is preserved today only in Arabic.

===Akkadian===
:Nominative: &quot;šarrum&quot; (king)
:Genitive: &quot;aššat šarrim&quot; (wife of king = king&#x27;s wife)

===Arabic===
Called المجرور &quot;al-majrūr&quot; (meaning &quot;dragged&quot;) or المخفوض &quot;al-makhfūḍ&quot; (meaning &quot;lowered&quot;) in Arabic, the genitive case functions both as an indication of ownership (ex. the door of the house) and for nouns following a preposition.

:Nominative: ٌبيت &quot;baytun&quot; (a house)
:Genitive: ٍبابُ بيت &quot;bābu baytin&quot; (door of a house) ِبابُ البيت &quot;bābu l-bayti&quot; (door of the house)

The Arabic genitive marking also appears after prepositions.
:e.g. ٍبابٌ لبيت &quot;bābun li-baytin&quot; (a door for a house)

The Semitic genitive should not be confused with the pronominal possessive suffixes that exist in all the Semitic languages

:e.g. Arabic بيتي &quot;bayt-ī&quot; (my house) َكتابُك &quot;kitābu-ka&quot; (your [masc.] book).

==Slavic languages==

With the exception of Bulgarian and Macedonian, all Slavic languages decline the nouns and adjectives in accordance with the genitive case using a variety of endings depending on the word&#x27;s lexical category, its gender, number (singular or plural) and in some cases meaning. For instance, in Russian Broutona (lit. Broughton&#x27;s) island name, its genitive/possessive case is created by adding &quot;a&quot; affix to the explorer&#x27;s name.

===Possessives===
To indicate possession the ending of the noun indicating the possessor changes depending on the word&#x27;s ending in the nominative case. 
For example, to &quot;a, u, i&quot;, or &quot;y&quot; in Polish, &quot;а, я, ы&quot;, or &quot;и&quot; in Russian, &quot;а, я, y, ю, і, и&quot; or &quot;ей&quot; in Ukrainian, and similar cases in other Slavic languages.

:Nominative: (pol.) &quot;Oto Anton&quot; / (rus.) &quot;Вот Антон&quot; / (ukr.) &quot;Ось Антон&quot; (&quot;Here is Anton&quot;).
:Genitive: (pol.) &quot;Oto obiad Antonа&quot; / (rus.) &quot;Вот обед Антона&quot; / (ukr.) &quot;Ось oбід Антона&quot; (&quot;Here is Anton&#x27;s lunch&quot;).

Possessives can also be formed by the construction (pol.) &quot;u [subject] jest [object]&quot; / (rus.) &quot;У [subject] есть [object]&quot;/ (ukr.) &quot;у(в) [subject] є [object]&quot;

:Nominative: (pol.) &quot;Oto Anton&quot; / (rus.) &quot;Вот Антон&quot; / (ukr.) &quot;Ось Антон&quot; (&quot;Here is Anton&quot;).
:Genitive: (pol.) &quot;u Antonа jest obiad / (rus.) &quot;У Антона есть обед&quot; / (ukr.) &quot;У(В) Антона є обід&quot; (&quot;Anton has a lunch&quot;, literally: &quot;(There) is a lunch at Anton&#x27;s&quot;).

In sentences where the possessor includes an associated pronoun, the pronoun also changes:

:Nominative: (pol.) Oto mój brat / (rus.) &quot;Вот мой брат&quot;/ (ukr.) &quot;От мій брат&quot; (&quot;Here is my brother&quot;).
:Genitive: (pol.) &quot;u mojego bratа jest obiad / (rus.) &quot;У моего брата есть обед&quot; / (ukr.) &quot;У мого брата є обід&quot; (&quot;My brother has a lunch&quot;, literally: &quot;(There) is a lunch at my_brother&#x27;s&quot;).

And in sentences denoting negative possession, the ending of the object noun also changes:

:Nominative: (pol.) &quot;Oto Irena/Kornelia&quot; / (rus.) &quot;Вот Ирена/Корнелия&quot; / (ukr.) &quot;От Ірена/Корнелія&quot; (&quot;Here is Irene/Kornelia&quot;).
:Genitive: (pol.) &quot;Irena/Kornelia nie ma obiadu (&quot;Irene/Kornelia does not have a lunch&quot;) or (pol.) &quot;u Ireny/Kornelii nie ma obiadu (&quot;(There) is no lunch at Irene&#x27;s/Kornelia&#x27;s&quot;) 
The Polish phrase &quot;nie ma [object]&quot; can work both as a negation of having [object] or a negation of an existence of [object], 
but the meaning of the two sentences and its structure is different. (In the first case [subject] is Irene, and in the second case [subject] is virtual, it is &quot;the space&quot; at Irene&#x27;s place, not Irene herself)
:Genitive: (rus.) &quot;У Ирены/Корнелии нет обеда&quot; (&quot;Irene/Kornelia does not have a lunch&quot;, literally: &quot;(There) is no lunch at Irene&#x27;s/Kornelia&#x27;s&quot;). 
The Russian word &quot;нет&quot; is a contraction of &quot;не&quot; + &quot;есть&quot;. 
In Russian there is no distinction between [subject] not having an [object] and [object] not being present at [subject]&#x27;s.
:Genitive: (ukr.) &quot;Ірена/Корнелія не має обіду (&quot;Irene does not have a lunch&quot;) or (ukr.) &quot;y Ірени/Корнелії нема(є) обіду (&quot;At Irene&#x27;s does not have a lunch&quot;) 
Note the difference between the spelling &quot;не має [object]&quot; and &quot;нема(є) [object]&quot; in both cases.

===To express negation===
The genitive case is also used in sentences expressing negation, even when no possessive relationship is involved. The ending of the subject noun changes just as it does in possessive sentences. The genitive, in this sense, can only be used to negate nominative, accusative and genitive sentences, and not other cases.

:Nominative: (pol.) &quot;(Czy) Maria jest w domu?&quot; / (rus.) &quot;Мария дома?&quot; / (Чи) Марія (є) вдома? (&quot;Is Maria at home?&quot;).
:Genitive: (pol.) &quot;Marii nie ma w domu&quot; (&quot;Maria is not at home&quot;, literally: &quot;[virtual subject] has no Maria at home&quot;)
:Genitive: (rus.) &quot;Марии нет дома&quot; (&quot;Maria is not at home&quot;, literally: &quot;Of Maria there is none at home.&quot;).
:Genitive: (ukr.) &quot;Марії нема(є) вдома&quot; (&quot;Maria is not at home&quot;, literally: &quot;[virtual subject] has no Maria at home.&quot;)

:Accusative: (pol.) &quot;Mogę rozczytać twoje pismo&quot; / (rus.) Могу (про)читать твой почерк / (ukr.) Можу (про)читати твій почерк (&quot;I can read your handwriting&quot;)
:Genitive: (pol.) &quot;Nie mogę rozczytać twojego pisma&quot; / (rus.) &quot;Не могу (про)читать твоего почерка&quot; / (ukr.) &quot;Не можу (про)читати твого почерку&quot; (&quot;I can&#x27;t read your handwriting&quot;)

Use of genitive for negation is obligatory in Slovene, Polish and Old Church Slavonic. Some East Slavic languages ( e.g. Russian and Belarusian) employ either the accusative or genitive for negation, although the genitive is more commonly used. In Czech, Slovak and Serbo-Croatian, negating with the genitive case is perceived as rather archaic and the accusative is preferred, but genitive negation in these languages is still not uncommon, especially in music and literature.

===Partial direct object===
The genitive case is used with some verbs and mass nouns to indicate that the action covers only a part of the direct object (having a function of non-existing partitive case), whereas similar constructions using the Accusative case denote full coverage. Compare the sentences:

:Genitive: (pol.) &quot;Napiłem się wody&quot; / (rus.) &quot;Я напился воды&quot; / (ukr.) &quot;Я напився води&quot; (&quot;I drank water,&quot; i.e. &quot;I drank some water, part of the water available&quot;)
:Accusative: (pol.) &quot;Wypiłem wodę&quot; / (rus.) &quot;Я выпил воду / (ukr.) &quot;Я випив воду (&quot;I drank the water,&quot; i.e. &quot;I drank all the water, all the water in question&quot;)

In Russian, special partitive case or sub-case is observed for some uncountable nouns which in some contexts have preferred alternative form on -у/ю instead of standard genitive on -а/я: выпил чаю (&#x27;drank some tea&#x27;), but сорта чая (&#x27;sorts of tea&#x27;).

===Prepositional constructions===
The genitive case is also used in many prepositional constructions. (Usually when some movement or change of state is involved, and when describing the source / destination of the movement. Sometimes also when describing the manner of acting.) 
*Czech prepositions using genitive case: od (from), z, ze (from), do (into), bez (without), kromě (excepting), místo (instead of), podle (after, according to), podél (along), okolo (around), u (near, by), vedle (beside), během (during), pomocí (using, by the help of), stran (as regards) etc.
*Polish prepositions using genitive case: od (from), z, ze (from), do, w (into), na (onto), bez (without), zamiast (instead of), wedle (after, according to), wzdłuż (along), około (around), u (near, by), koło (beside), podczas (during), etc.
*Russian prepositions using genitive case: от (from), с, со (from), до (before, up to), без (without), кроме (excepting), вместо (instead of), после (after), вдоль (along), около (around), у (near, by), во время (during), насчёт (regarding), etc.

==Turkish==

The Turkish genitive, formed with a genitive suffix for the possessor, is used in combination with a possessive for the possessed entity, formed with a possessive suffix. For example, in &quot;my mother&#x27;s mother&quot;, the possessor is &quot;my mother&quot;, and the possessed entity is &quot;[her] mother&quot;. In Turkish:
:Nominative: &quot;anne&quot; (&quot;mother&quot;);
:First-person possessive: &quot;annem&quot; (&quot;my mother&quot;);
:Third-person possessive: &quot;annesi&quot; (&quot;[someone]&#x27;s mother&quot;); 
:Genitive of &quot;annem&quot;: &quot;annemin&quot; (&quot;my mother&#x27;s&quot;);
:Genitive and possessive combined: &quot;annemin annesi&quot; (&quot;my mother&#x27;s mother&quot;, i.e., &quot;my maternal grandmother&quot;).

==Albanian==

The genitive in Albanian is formed with the help of clitics. For example:

:Nominative: &quot;libër&quot; (&#x27;book&#x27;); &quot;vajzë&quot; (&#x27;girl&#x27;); 
:Genitive: &quot;libri i vajzës&quot; (the girl&#x27;s book)

If the possessed object is masculine, the clitic is &quot;i&quot;. If the possessed object is feminine, the clitic is &quot;e&quot;. If the possessed object is plural, the clitic is &quot;e&quot; regardless of the gender.

The genitive is used with some prepositions: &quot;me anë&quot; (&#x27;by means of&#x27;), &quot;nga ana&quot; (&#x27;on behalf of&#x27;, &#x27;from the side of&#x27;), &quot;për arsye&quot; (&#x27;due to&#x27;), &quot;për shkak&quot; (&#x27;because of&#x27;), &quot;me përjashtim&quot; (&#x27;with the exception of&#x27;), &quot;në vend&quot; (&#x27;instead of&#x27;).

== Armenian ==
The genitive in Armenian is generally formed by adding &quot;-ի&quot;:

Nominative: աղջիկ (&#x27;girl&#x27;); գիրք (&#x27;book&#x27;);

Genitive: աղջիկի գիրքը (&quot;the girl&#x27;s book&quot;).

However, there are certain words that are not formed this way. For example, words with ուն change to ան:

Nominative: տուն (&#x27;house&#x27;), Genitive: տան (&quot;house&#x27;s&quot;).

==Dravidian languages==

===Kannada===

In Kannada, the genitive case-endings are:

for masculine or feminine nouns ending in &quot;ಅ&quot; (a): ನ (na)
* Examples: &quot;sūrya-na&quot; (&#x27;of the sun&#x27;)

for neuter nouns ending in &quot;ಅ&quot; (a): ದ (da)
* Examples: &quot;mara-da&quot; (&#x27;of the tree&#x27;)

for all nouns ending in &quot;ಇ&quot; (i), &quot;ಈ&quot; (ī), &quot;ಎ&quot; (e), or &quot;ಏ&quot; (ē): ಅ (a)
* Examples: &quot;mane-y-a&quot; (&#x27;of the house&#x27;; a linking &quot;y&quot; is added between the stem and the suffix)

for all nouns ending in &quot;ಉ&quot; (u), &quot;ಊ&quot; (ū), &quot;ಋ&quot; (r̥), or &quot;ೠ&quot; (r̥̄): ಇನ (ina)
* Examples; &quot;guru-v-ina&quot; (&#x27;of the teacher&#x27;; a linking &quot;v&quot; is added between the stem and the suffix)

Most postpositions in Kannada take the genitive case.

===Tamil===

In Tamil, the genitive case ending is the word உடைய or இன், which signifies possession. Depending on the last letter of the noun, the genitive case endings may vary.

If the last letter is a consonant (மெய் எழுத்து), like க், ங், ச், ஞ், ட், ண், த், ந், ப், ம், ய், ர், ல், வ், ழ், then the suffix உடைய/இன் gets added. *Examples: His: அவன் + உடைய = அவனுடைய, Doctor&#x27;s: மருத்துவர் + உடைய = மருத்துவருடைய, மருத்துவர் + இன் = மருத்துவரின் Kumar&#x27;s: குமார் + உடைய = குமாருடைய, குமார்+ இன் = குமாரின்

<text>In numerology, gematria (; or , plural or ) is the practice of assigning a numerical value to a name, word or phrase by reading it as a number, or sometimes by using an alphanumerical cipher. The letters of the alphabets involved have standard numerical values, but a word can yield several values if a cipher is used.

According to Aristotle (384–322 BCE), isopsephy, based on the Milesian numbering of the Greek alphabet developed in the Greek city of Miletus, was part of the Pythagorean tradition, which originated in the 6th century BCE. The first evidence of use of Hebrew letters as numbers dates to 78 BCE; gematria is still used in Jewish culture. Similar systems have been used in other languages and cultures, derived from or inspired by either Greek isopsephy or Hebrew gematria, and include Arabic abjad numerals and English gematria.

The most common form of Hebrew gematria is used in the Talmud and Midrash, and elaborately by many post-Talmudic commentators. It involves reading words and sentences as numbers and assigning numerical instead of phonetic values to each letter of the Hebrew alphabet. When read as numbers, they can be compared and contrasted with other words or phrases – cf. the Hebrew proverb (, , i.e. ). The gematric value of (&#x27;wine&#x27;) is 70 (=10; =10; =50) and this is also the gematric value of (&#x27;secret&#x27;, =60; =6; =4)‎.

Gematria sums can involve single words, or a string of lengthy calculations. A short example of Hebrew numerology that uses gematria is the word , which is composed of two letters that (using the assignments in the table shown below) add up to 18. This has made 18 a &quot;lucky number&quot; among Jews. In early Jewish sources, the term can also refer to other forms of calculation or letter manipulation, for example atbash.

==Etymology==
Classical scholars agree that the Hebrew word &quot;gematria&quot; was derived from the Greek word γεωμετρία &quot;geōmetriā&quot;, &quot;geometry&quot;, though some scholars believe it to derive from Greek γραμματεια &quot;grammateia&quot; &quot;knowledge of writing&quot;. It is likely that both Greek words had an influence on the formation of the Hebrew word. Some hold it to derive from the order of the Greek alphabet, gamma being the third letter of the Greek alphabet (&quot;gamma tria&quot;).

The word has been extant in English since at least the 17th century from translations of works by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. It is largely used in Jewish texts, notably in those associated with the Kabbalah. Neither the concept nor the term appears in the Hebrew Bible itself.

==History==

The first documented use of gematria is from an Assyrian inscription dating to the 8th century BCE, commissioned by Sargon II. In this inscription, Sargon II states: &quot;the king built the wall of Khorsabad 16,283 cubits long to correspond with the numerical value of his name.&quot;

The practice of using alphabetic letters to represent numbers developed in the Greek city of Miletus, and is thus known as the Milesian system. Early examples include vase graffiti dating to the 6th century BCE. Aristotle wrote that the Pythgoraean tradition, founded in the 6th century BCE by Pythagoras of Samos, practiced isopsephy, the Greek predecessor of gematria. Pythagoras was a contemporary of the philosophers Anaximander, Anaximenes, and the historian Hecataeus, all of whom lived in Miletus, across the sea from Samos. The Milesian system was in common use by the reign of Alexander the Great (336–323 BCE) and was adopted by other cultures during the subsequent Hellenistic period. It was officially adopted in Egypt during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (284–246 BCE).

In early biblical texts, numbers were written out in full using Hebrew number words. The first evidence of the use of Hebrew letters as numerals appears during the late Hellenistic period, in 78 BCE. Scholars have identified gematria in the Hebrew Bible, the canon of which was fixed during the Hasmonean dynasty (c. 140 BCE to 37 BCE), though some scholars argue it was not fixed until the second century CE or even later. The Hasmonean king of Judea, Alexander Jannaeus (died 76 BCE) had coins inscribed in Aramaic with the Phoenician alphabet, marking the 20th and 25th years of his reign using the letters K and KE ( and ).

Some old Mishnaic texts may preserve very early usage of this number system, but no surviving written documents exist, and some scholars believe these texts were passed down orally and during the early stages before the Bar Kochba rebellion were never written. Gematria is not known to be found in the Dead Sea scrolls, a vast body of texts from 100 BCE100 CE, or in any of the documents found from the Bar-Kochba revolt circa 150 CE.

According to Proclus in his commentary on the &quot;Timaeus&quot; of Plato written in the 5th century, the author Theodorus Asaeus from a century earlier interpreted the word &quot;soul&quot; (ψυχή) based on gematria and an inspection of the graphical aspects of the letters that make up the word. According to Proclus, Theodorus learned these methods from the writings of Numenius of Apamea and Amelius. Proclus rejects these methods by appealing to the arguments against them put forth by the Neoplatonic philosopher Iamblichus. The first argument was that some letters have the same numerical value but opposite meaning. His second argument was that the form of letters changes over the years, and so their graphical qualities cannot hold any deeper meaning. Finally, he puts forth the third argument that when one uses all sorts of methods as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and even ratios, the infinite ways in which these can be combined allow virtually any number to be produced to suit any purpose.

Some scholars propose that at least two cases of gematria appear in the New Testament. According to one theory, the reference to the miraculous &quot;catch of 153 fish&quot; in John 21:11 is an application of gematria derived from the name of the spring called &#x27;EGLaIM in Ezekiel 47:10. The appearance of this gematria in John 21:11 has been connected to one of the Dead Sea Scrolls, namely 4Q252, which also applies the same gematria of 153 derived from Ezekiel 47 to state that Noah arrived at Mount Ararat on the 153rd day after the beginning of the flood. Some historians see gematria behind the reference to the number of the name of the Beast in Revelation as 666, which corresponds to the numerical value of the Hebrew transliteration of the Greek name &quot;Neron Kaisar&quot;, referring to the 1st century Roman emperor who persecuted the early Christians. Another possible influence on the use of 666 in Revelation goes back to reference to Solomon&#x27;s intake of 666 talents of gold in 1 Kings 10:14.

Gematria makes several appearances in various Christian and Jewish texts written in the first centuries of the common era. One appearance of gematria in the early Christian period is in the Epistle of Barnabas 9:6–7, which dates to sometime between 70 and 132 CE. There, the 318 servants of Abraham in Genesis 14:14 is used to indicate that Abraham looked forward to the coming of Jesus as the numerical value of some of the letters in the Greek name for Jesus and the &#x27;t&#x27; representing a symbol for the cross also equaled 318. Another example is a Christian interpolation in the Sibylline Oracles, where the symbolic significance of the value of 888 (equal to the numerical value of &quot;Iesous&quot;, the Latinized rendering of the Greek version of Jesus&#x27; name) is asserted. Irenaeus also heavily criticized the interpretation of letters by the Gnostic Marcus. Because of their association with Gnosticism and the criticisms of Irenaeus and Hippolytus of Rome and Epiphanius of Salamis, this form of interpretation never became popular in Christianity—though it does appear in at least some texts. Another two examples can be found in 3 Baruch, a text that may have either been composed by a Jew or a Christian sometime between the 1st and 3rd centuries. In the first example, a snake is stated to consume a cubit of ocean every day, but is unable to ever finish consuming it, because the oceans are also refilled by 360 rivers. The number 360 is given because the numerical value of the Greek word for snake, &quot;δράκων&quot;, when transliterated to Hebrew () is 360. In a second example, the number of giants stated to have died during the Deluge is 409,000. The Greek word for &#x27;deluge&#x27;, &quot;κατακλυσμός&quot;, has a numerical value of 409 when transliterated in Hebrew characters, thus leading the author of 3 Baruch to use it for the number of perished giants.

Gematria is often used in Rabbinic literature. One example is that the numerical value of &quot;The Satan&quot; () in Hebrew is 364, and so it was said that the Satan had authority to prosecute Israel for 364 days before his reign ended on the Day of Atonement, an idea which appears in Yoma 20a and Peskita 7a. Yoma 20a states: &quot;Rami bar Ḥama said: The numerological value of the letters that constitute the word HaSatan is three hundred and sixty four: Heh has a value of five, sin has a value of three hundred, tet has a value of nine, and nun has a value of fifty. Three hundred and sixty-four days of the solar year, which is three hundred and sixty-five days long, Satan has license to prosecute.&quot; Genesis 14:14 states that Abraham took 318 of his servants to help him rescue some of his kinsmen, which was taken in Peskita 70b to be a reference to Eleazar, whose name has a numerical value of 318.

The total value of the letters of the Islamic Basmala, i.e. the phrase &quot;Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim&quot; (&quot;In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful&quot;), according to the standard Abjadi system of numerology, is 786. This number has therefore acquired a significance in folk Islam and Near Eastern folk magic and also appears in many instances of pop-culture, such as its appearance in the 2006 song &#x27;786 All is War&#x27; by the band Fun-Da-Mental. A recommendation of reciting the basmala 786 times in sequence is recorded in Al-Buni. Sündermann (2006) reports that a contemporary &quot;spiritual healer&quot; from Syria recommends the recitation of the basmala 786 times over a cup of water, which is then to be ingested as medicine. The use of gematria is still pervasive in many parts of Asia and Africa.

==Methods of Hebrew gematria==
===Standard encoding===
In standard gematria (&quot;mispar hechrechi&quot;), each letter is given a numerical value between 1 and 400, as shown in the following table. In &quot;mispar gadol&quot;, the five final letters are given their own values, ranging from 500 to 900. It is possible that this well-known cipher was used to conceal other more hidden ciphers in Jewish texts. For instance, a scribe may discuss a sum using the &#x27;standard gematria&#x27; cipher, but may intend the sum to be checked with a different secret cipher.

A mathematical formula for finding a letter&#x27;s corresponding number in &quot;mispar gadol&quot; is:

:formula_1

where &quot;x&quot; is the position of the letter in the language letters index (regular order of letters), and the floor and modulo functions are used.

===Vowels===
The value of the Hebrew vowels is not usually counted, but some lesser-known methods include the vowels as well. The most common vowel values are as follows (a less common alternative value, based on the digit sum, is given in parentheses):

Sometimes, the names of the vowels are spelled out and their gematria is calculated using standard methods.

===Other methods===
There are many different methods used to calculate the numerical value for the individual Hebrew/Aramaic words, phrases or whole sentences. Gematria is the 29th of 32 hermeneutical rules countenanced by the Rabbis of the Talmud for valid aggadic interpretation of the Torah. More advanced methods are usually used for the most significant Biblical verses, prayers, names of God, etc. These methods include:
* &quot;Mispar hechrachi&quot; (absolute value) is the standard method. It assigns the values 1–9, 10–90, 100–400 to the 22 Hebrew letters in order. Sometimes it is also called &quot;mispar ha-panim&quot; (face number), as opposed to the more complicated &quot;mispar ha-akhor&quot; (back number).
* &quot;Mispar gadol&quot; (large value) counts the final forms (sofit) of the Hebrew letters as a continuation of the numerical sequence for the alphabet, with the final letters assigned values from 500 to 900. The name &quot;mispar gadol&quot; is sometimes used for a different method, &quot;Otiyot beMilui&quot;.
* The same name, &quot;mispar gadol&quot;, is also used for another method, which spells the name of each letter and adds the standard values of the resulting string. For example, the letter &quot;aleph&quot; is spelled &quot;aleph lamed peh&quot;, giving it a value of formula_2.
* &quot;Mispar katan&quot; (small value) calculates the value of each letter, but truncates all of the zeros. It is also sometimes called &quot;mispar me&#x27;ugal&quot;.
* &quot;Mispar siduri&quot; (ordinal value) with each of the 22 letters given a value from 1 to 22.
* &quot;Mispar bone&#x27;eh&quot; (building value, also &quot;revu&#x27;a&quot;, square) is calculated by walking over each letter from the beginning to the end, adding the value of all previous letters and the value of the current letter to the running total. Therefore, the value of the word &quot;achad&quot; (one) is formula_3.
* &quot;Mispar kidmi&quot; (preceding value) uses each letter as the sum of all the standard gematria letter values preceding it. Therefore, the value of &quot;aleph&quot; is 1, the value of &quot;bet&quot; is 1+2=3, the value of &quot;gimel&quot; is 1+2+3=6, etc. It is also known as &quot;mispar meshulash&quot; (triangular or tripled number).
* &quot;Mispar p&#x27;rati&quot; calculates the value of each letter as the square of its standard gematria value. Therefore, the value of &quot;aleph&quot; is 1 × 1 = 1, the value of &quot;bet&quot; is 2 × 2 = 4, the value of &quot;gimel&quot; is 3 × 3 = 9, etc. It is also known as &quot;mispar ha-merubah ha-prati&quot;.
* &quot;Mispar ha-merubah ha-klali&quot; is the square of the standard absolute value of each word.
* &quot;Mispar meshulash&quot; calculates the value of each letter as the cube of their standard value. The same term is more often used for &quot;mispar kidmi&quot;.
* &quot;Mispar ha-akhor&quot; – The value of each letter is its standard value multiplied by the position of the letter in a word or a phrase in either ascending or descending order. This method is particularly interesting, because the result is sensitive to the order of letters. It is also sometimes called &quot;mispar meshulash&quot; (triangular number).
* &quot;Mispar mispari&quot; spells out the standard values of each letter by their Hebrew names (&quot;achad&quot; (one) is formula_4 etc.), and then adds up the standard values of the resulting string.
* &quot;Otiyot be-milui&quot; (&quot;filled letters&quot;, also known as &quot;mispar gadol&quot; or &quot;mispar shemi&quot;), uses the value of each letter as equal to the value of its name. For example, the value of the letter &quot;aleph&quot; is formula_5, &quot;bet&quot; is formula_6, etc. Sometimes the same operation is applied two or more times recursively. In a variation known as &quot;otiyot pnimiyot&quot; (inner letters), the initial letter in the spelled-out name is omitted, thus the value of &quot;aleph&quot; becomes 30+80=110.
* &quot;Mispar ne&#x27;elam&quot; (hidden number) spells out the name of each letter without the letter itself (e.g., &quot;leph&quot; for &quot;aleph&quot;) and adds up the value of the resulting string.
* &quot;Mispar katan mispari&quot; (integral reduced value) is used where the total numerical value of a word is reduced to a single digit. If the sum of the value exceeds 9, the integer values of the total are repeatedly added to produce a single-digit number. The same value will be arrived at regardless of whether it is the absolute values, the ordinal values, or the reduced values that are being counted by methods above. For example, the value of word &quot;emet&quot; (truth - אֶמֶת) is &quot;aleph&quot; + &quot;mem&quot; + &quot;tav&quot;: formula_7 &quot;Emet - Emet&quot; is formula_8 &quot;emet - emet - emet&quot; is formula_9 etc.
* &quot;Mispar musafi&quot; adds the number of the letters in the word or phrase to their gematria.
* &quot;Kolel&quot; is the number of words, which is often added to the gematria. In case of one word, the standard value is incremented by one.

===Related transformations===
Within the wider topic of gematria are included the various alphabet transformations, where one letter is substituted by another based on a logical scheme:
* &quot;Atbash&quot; exchanges each letter in a word or a phrase by &quot;opposite&quot; letters. Opposite letters are determined by substituting the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet (&quot;aleph&quot;) with the last letter (&quot;tav&quot;), the second letter (&quot;bet&quot;) with the next to last (&quot;shin&quot;), etc. The result can be interpreted as a secret message or calculated by the standard gematria methods. A few instances of &quot;atbash&quot; are found already in the Hebrew Bible. For example, see Jeremiah 25:26, and 51:41, with Targum and Rashi, in which the name ששך (&quot;Sheshek&quot;) is thought to represent בבל (Babylon).
* &quot;Albam&quot; – the alphabet is divided in half, eleven letters in each section. The first letter of the first series is exchanged for the first letter of the second series, the second letter of the first series for the second letter of the second series, and so forth.
* &quot;Achbi&quot; divides the alphabet into two equal groups of 11 letters. Within each group, the first letter is replaced by the last, the second by the 10th, etc.
* &quot;Ayak bakar&quot; replaces each letter by another one that has a 10-times-greater value. The final letters usually signify the numbers from 500 to 900. Thousands is reduced to ones (1,000 becomes 1, 2,000 becomes 2, etc.)
* &quot;Ofanim&quot; replaces each letter by the last letter of its name (e.g. &quot;peh&quot; for &quot;aleph&quot;).
* &quot;Akhas beta&quot; divides the alphabet into three groups of 7, 7 and 8 letters. Each letter is replaced cyclically by the corresponding letter of the next group. The letter Tav remains the same.
* &quot;Avgad&quot; replaces each letter by the next one. &quot;Tav&quot; becomes &quot;aleph&quot;. The opposite operation is also used.
Most of the above-mentioned methods and ciphers are listed by Rabbi Moshe Cordevero.

Some authors provide lists of as many as 231 various replacement ciphers, related to the 231 mystical Gates of the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;.

Dozens of other far more advanced methods are used in Kabbalistic literature, without any particular names. In Ms. Oxford 1,822, one article lists 75 different forms of gematria. Some known methods are recursive in nature and are reminiscent of graph theory or make a lot of use of combinatorics. Rabbi Elazar Rokeach (born c. 1176 – died 1238) often used multiplication, instead of addition, for the above-mentioned methods. For example, spelling out the letters of a word and then multiplying the squares of each letter value in the resulting string produces very large numbers, in orders of trillions. The spelling process can be applied recursively, until a certain pattern (e.g., all the letters of the word &quot;Talmud&quot;) is found; the gematria of the resulting string is then calculated. The same author also used the sums of all possible unique letter combinations, which add up to the value of a given letter. For example, the letter Hei, which has the standard value of 5, can be produced by combining formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, formula_13, formula_14, or formula_15, which adds up to formula_16. Sometimes combinations of repeating letters are not allowed (e.g., formula_15 is valid, but formula_12 is not). The original letter itself can also be viewed as a valid combination.

Variant spellings of some letters can be used to produce sets of different numbers, which can be added up or analyzed separately. Many various complex formal systems and recursive algorithms, based on graph-like structural analysis of the letter names and their relations to each other, modular arithmetic, pattern search and other highly advanced techniques, are found in the &quot;Sefer ha-Malchut&quot; by Rabbi David ha-Levi of the Draa Valley, a Spanish-Moroccan Kabbalist of the 15th–16th century. Rabbi David ha-Levi&#x27;s methods also consider the numerical values and other properties of the vowels.

Kabbalistic astrology uses some specific methods to determine the astrological influences on a particular person. According to one method, the gematria of the person&#x27;s name is added to the gematria of his or her mother&#x27;s name; the result is then divided by 7 and 12. The remainders signify a particular planet and Zodiac sign.

===Transliterated Hebrew===
Historically, hermetic and esoteric groups of the 19th and 20th centuries in the UK and in France used a transliterated Hebrew cipher with the Latin alphabet. In particular, the transliterated cipher was taught to members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. In 1887, S.L. MacGregor Mathers, who was one of the order&#x27;s founders, published the transliterated cipher in &quot;The Kabbalah Unveiled&quot; in the Mathers table.

As a former member of the Golden Dawn, Aleister Crowley used the transliterated cipher extensively in his writings for his two magical orders the A∴A∴ and Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O). Many other occult authors belonging to various esoteric groups have either mentioned the cipher or published it in their books, including Paul Foster Case of the Builders of the Adytum (B.O.T.A).

==Use in non-Semitic languages==
===Greek===

According to Aristotle (384–322 BCE), isopsephy, an early Milesian system using the Greek alphabet, was part of the Pythagorean tradition, which originated in the 6th century BCE.

Plato (c. 427–347 BCE) offers a discussion in the &quot;Cratylus&quot;, involving a view of words and names as referring (more or less accurately) to the &quot;essential nature&quot; of a person or object and that this view may have influenced—and is central to—isopsephy.

A sample of graffiti at Pompeii (destroyed under volcanic ash in 79 CE) reads &quot;I love the girl whose name is phi mu epsilon (545)&quot;.

Other examples of use in Greek come primarily from the Christian literature. Davies and Allison state that, unlike rabbinic sources, isopsephy is always explicitly stated as being used.

===Latin===

During the Renaissance, systems of gematria were devised for the Classical Latin alphabet. There were a number of variations of these which were popular in Europe.

In 1525, Christoph Rudolff included a Classical Latin gematria in his work &quot;Nimble and beautiful calculation via the artful rules of algebra [which] are so commonly called &quot;coss&quot;&quot;:

 A=1 B=2 C=3 D=4 E=5 F=6 G=7 H=8 I=9 K=10 L=11 M=12
 N=13 O=14 P=15 Q=16 R=17 S=18 T=19 U=20 W=21 X=22 Y=23 Z=24

At the beginning of the &quot;Apocalypisis in Apocalypsin&quot; (1532), the German monk Michael Stifel (also known as Steifel) describes the natural order and trigonal number alphabets, claiming to have invented the latter. He used the trigonal alphabet to interpret the prophecy in the Biblical Book of Revelation, and predicted the world would end at 8am on October 19, 1533. The official Lutheran reaction to Steifel&#x27;s prophecy shows that this type of activity was not welcome. Belief in the power of numbers was unacceptable in reformed circles, and gematria was not part of the reformation agenda.

An analogue of the Greek system of isopsephy using the Latin alphabet appeared in 1583, in the works of the French poet Étienne Tabourot. This cipher and variations of it were published or referred to in the major work of Italian Pietro Bongo &quot;Numerorum Mysteria,&quot; and a 1651 work by Georg Philipp Harsdörffer, and by Athanasius Kircher in 1665, and in a 1683 volume of &quot;Cabbalologia&quot; by Johann Henning, where it was simply referred to as the &quot;1683 alphabet&quot;. It was mentioned in the work of &quot;The European Helicon or Muse Mountain&quot;, in 1704, and it was also called the &quot;Alphabetum Cabbalisticum Vulgare&quot; in &quot;Die verliebte und galante Welt&quot; by Christian Friedrich Hunold in 1707. It was used by Leo Tolstoy in his 1865 work &quot;War and Peace&quot; to identify Napoleon with the number of the Beast.

===English===

English Qabalah refers to several different systems of mysticism related to Hermetic Qabalah that interpret the letters of the English alphabet via an assigned set of numerological significances. The first system of English gematria was used by the poet John Skelton in 1523 in his poem &quot;The Garland of Laurel&quot;.

The Agrippa code was used with English and Latin. It was defined by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa in 1532, in his work &quot;De Occulta Philosopha&quot;. Agrippa based his system on the order of the Classical Latin alphabet using a ranked valuation as in isopsephy, appending the four additional letters in use at the time after Z, including J (600) and U (700), which were still considered letter variants. Agrippa was the mentor of English magician John Dee, who makes reference to the Agrippa code in Theorem XVI of his 1564 book, &quot;Monas Hieroglyphica&quot;.

Although Aleister Crowley, as a former Adept of the Golden Dawn, used a transliterated approach to gematria in his works, since Crowley&#x27;s death a number of people have proposed numerical correspondences for English gematria in order to achieve a deeper understanding of Crowley&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; (1904). One such system, the English Qaballa, was discovered by English magician James Lees on November 26, 1976. The founding of Lees&#x27; magical order in 1974 and his discovery of EQ are chronicled in &quot;All This and a Book&quot; by Cath Thompson.

<text>The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in Palo Alto, California, in 1965. Known for their eclectic style that fused elements of rock, blues, jazz, folk, country, bluegrass, rock and roll, gospel, reggae, and world music with psychedelia, the band is famous for improvisation during their live performances, and for their devoted fan base, known as &quot;Deadheads&quot;. According to the musician and writer Lenny Kaye, the music of the Grateful Dead &quot;touches on ground that most other groups don&#x27;t even know exists.&quot; For the range of their influences and the structure of their live performances, the Grateful Dead are considered &quot;the pioneering godfathers of the jam band world&quot;.

The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area during the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The band&#x27;s founding members were Jerry Garcia (lead guitar and vocals), Bob Weir (rhythm guitar and vocals), Ron &quot;Pigpen&quot; McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, and vocals), Phil Lesh (bass guitar and vocals), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead, originally known as the Warlocks, had played together in various Bay Area ensembles, including the traditional jug band Mother McCree&#x27;s Uptown Jug Champions. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they changed their name to Grateful Dead, replacing Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and non-performing lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who left the band from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history. Other official members of the band included Tom Constanten (keyboards from 1968 to 1970), John Perry Barlow (non-performing lyricist from 1971 to 1995), Keith Godchaux (keyboards and occasional vocals from 1971 to 1979), Donna Godchaux (vocals from 1972 to 1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards and vocals from 1979 to 1990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards and vocals from 1990 to 1995). Bruce Hornsby (accordion, piano, vocals) was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as a guest with the band on occasion before and after the tours.

After Garcia&#x27;s death in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as The Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and as The Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009. In 2015, the four surviving core members marked the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary in a series of concerts in Santa Clara, California, and Chicago that were billed as their last performances together. There have also been several spin-offs featuring one or more core members, such as Dead &amp; Company, Furthur, the Rhythm Devils, Phil Lesh and Friends, RatDog, and Billy &amp; the Kids.

Despite having only one Top-40 single in their 30-year career, &quot;Touch of Grey&quot; (1987), the Grateful Dead remained among the highest-grossing American touring acts for decades. They gained a committed fanbase by word of mouth and through the free exchange of their live recordings, encouraged by the band&#x27;s allowance of taping. In 2024, they broke the record for most Top-40 albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the Grateful Dead number 57 on its 2011 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, and a recording of their May 8, 1977 performance at Cornell University&#x27;s Barton Hall was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2012 for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2024, Weir, Lesh, Kreutzmann, and Hart were recognized as part of the Kennedy Center Honors.

==Formation (1965–1966)==

The Grateful Dead began their career as the Warlocks, a group formed in early 1965 from the remnants of a Palo Alto, California jug band called Mother McCree&#x27;s Uptown Jug Champions and members of The Wildwood Boys (Jerry Garcia, Ron &quot;Pigpen&quot; McKernan, David Nelson, Robert Hunter, and Norm Van Maastricht). As The Wildwood Boys they played regularly at The Tangent, a folk music coffeehouse operated by Stanford Medical Center doctors Stuart &quot;Stu&quot; Goldstein and David &quot;Dave&quot; Shoenstadt on University Avenue in Palo Alto (1963). As the Warlocks, the band&#x27;s first show was at Magoo&#x27;s Pizza Parlor, at 639 Santa Cruz Avenue in suburban Menlo Park, on May 5, 1965, now a Harvest furniture store. The band continued playing bar shows, like Frenchy&#x27;s Bikini-A-Go-Go in Hayward and, importantly, five sets a night, five nights a week, for six weeks, at the &quot;In Room&quot; in Belmont as the Warlocks, but quickly changed the band&#x27;s name after finding out that a different band known as the Warlocks had put out a record under that name. (The Velvet Underground also had to change its name from the Warlocks.) 

The name &quot;Grateful Dead&quot; was chosen from a dictionary. According to Lesh, Garcia &quot;picked up an old &quot;Britannica World Language Dictionary&quot; ... [and] ... In that silvery elf-voice he said to me, &#x27;Hey, man, how about the Grateful Dead?&#x27;&quot; The definition there was &quot;the soul of a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial.&quot; According to Alan Trist, director of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s music publisher company Ice Nine, Garcia found the name in the Funk &amp; Wagnalls &quot;Folklore Dictionary&quot;, when his finger landed on that phrase while playing a game of Fictionary. In the Garcia biography &quot;Captain Trips&quot;, author Sandy Troy states that the band was smoking the psychedelic DMT at the time. The motif of the &quot;grateful dead&quot; appears in folktales from a variety of cultures.

The first show under the name Grateful Dead was in San Jose on December 4, 1965, at one of Ken Kesey&#x27;s Acid Tests. Scholar Michael Kaler has written that the Dead&#x27;s participation in the Acid Tests was crucial both to the development of their improvisational vocabulary and to their bonding as a band, with the group having set out to foster an intra-band musical telepathy. Kaler has further pointed out that the Dead&#x27;s pursuit of a new improvisatory rock language in 1965 chronologically coincided with that same goal&#x27;s adoption by Jefferson Airplane, Pink Floyd and the Velvet Underground.

Earlier demo tapes have survived, but the first of over 2,000 concerts known to have been recorded by the band&#x27;s fans was a show at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco on January 8, 1966. Later that month, the Grateful Dead played at the Trips Festival, a three-day psychedelic rock weekend party and event produced by Ken Kesey, Stewart Brand, and Ramon Sender, that, in conjunction with the Merry Pranksters, brought the nascent hippie movement together for the first time.

Other supporting personnel who joined early included Rock Scully, who heard of the band from Kesey and signed on as manager after meeting them at the Big Beat Acid Test; Stewart Brand, &quot;with his side show of taped music and slides of Indian life, a multimedia presentation&quot; at the Big Beat and then, expanded, at the Trips Festival; and Owsley Stanley, the &quot;Acid King&quot; whose LSD supplied the Acid Tests and who, in early 1966, became the band&#x27;s financial backer, renting them a house on the fringes of Watts, Los Angeles, and buying them sound equipment. &quot;We were living solely off of Owsley&#x27;s good graces at that time. ... [His] trip was he wanted to design equipment for us, and we were going to have to be in sort of a lab situation for him to do it&quot;, said Garcia.

==Main career (1967–1995)==
===Pigpen era (1967–1972)===

One of the group&#x27;s earliest major performances in 1967 was the Mantra-Rock Dance, a musical event held on January 29, 1967, at the Avalon Ballroom by the San Francisco Hare Krishna temple. The Grateful Dead performed at the event along with the Hare Krishna founder Bhaktivedanta Swami, poet Allen Ginsberg, bands Moby Grape and Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin, donating proceeds to the temple. The band&#x27;s first LP, &quot;The Grateful Dead&quot;, was released on Warner Brothers in 1967.

On May 3, 1968, the band played a free concert at Columbia University during the anti–Vietnam War student protests during which students occupied several campus buildings. In order to play, the band, equipment and all, had to be “smuggled” on campus in the back of a bread delivery truck. “We were already jamming away before the security and police could stop us.”

Classically trained trumpeter Phil Lesh performed on bass guitar. Bob Weir, the youngest original member of the group, played rhythm guitar. Ron &quot;Pigpen&quot; McKernan played keyboards, percussion, and harmonica until shortly before his death in 1973 at the age of 27. Garcia, Weir, and McKernan shared the lead vocal duties more or less equally; Lesh sang only a few leads, but his tenor was a key part of the band&#x27;s three-part vocal harmonies. Bill Kreutzmann played drums, and in September 1967 was joined by a second drummer, New York City native Mickey Hart, who also played a wide variety of other percussion instruments.

1970 included tour dates in New Orleans, where the band performed at The Warehouse for two nights. On January 31, 1970, the local police raided their hotel on Bourbon Street and arrested and charged 19 people with possession of various drugs. The second night&#x27;s concert was performed as scheduled after bail was posted. Eventually, the charges were dismissed, except those against sound engineer Owsley Stanley, who was already facing charges in California for manufacturing LSD. This event was later memorialized in the lyrics of “Truckin&#x27;&quot;, a single from &quot;American Beauty&quot; that reached number 64 on the charts.

Hart took time off from the band in February 1971, after his father, an accountant, absconded with much of the band&#x27;s money; Kreutzmann was once again as the sole percussionist. Hart rejoined the Grateful Dead for good in October 1974. Tom &quot;TC&quot; Constanten was added as a second keyboardist from 1968 to 1970, to help Pigpen keep up with an increasingly psychedelic sound, while Pigpen transitioned into playing various percussion instruments and vocals.

After Constanten&#x27;s departure, Pigpen reclaimed his position as sole keyboardist. Less than two years later, in late 1971, Pigpen was joined by another keyboardist, Keith Godchaux, who played grand piano alongside Pigpen&#x27;s Hammond B-3 organ. In early 1972, Keith&#x27;s wife, Donna Jean Godchaux, joined the Grateful Dead as a backing vocalist.

Following the Grateful Dead&#x27;s &quot;Europe &#x27;72&quot; tour, Pigpen&#x27;s health had deteriorated to the point that he could no longer tour with the band. His final concert appearance was June 17, 1972, at the Hollywood Bowl, in Los Angeles; he died on March 8, 1973, of complications from liver damage.

=== Godchaux era (1972–1979) ===

Pigpen&#x27;s death did not slow down the Grateful Dead. With the help of manager Ron Rakow, the band soon formed its own record label, Grateful Dead Records. Later that year, it released its next studio album, the jazz-influenced &quot;Wake of the Flood,&quot; which became their biggest commercial success thus far. Meanwhile, capitalizing on the album&#x27;s success, the band soon went back to the studio, and in June 1974 released another album, &quot;From the Mars Hotel&quot;. Not long after, the Dead decided to take a hiatus from live touring. The band travelled to Europe for a string of shows in September 1974, before performing a series of five concerts at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco in October 1974, and delved into various other projects. The Winterland concerts were filmed, and Garcia compiled the footage into &quot;The Grateful Dead Movie&quot;, a feature-length concert film released in 1977.

In September 1975, the Dead released their eighth studio album, &quot;Blues for Allah&quot;. The band resumed touring in June 1976, playing multiple dates in small theaters, rather than the stadium shows that had become common, and had exhausted them, in 1974. That same year, they signed with Arista Records, and the new contract produced &quot;Terrapin Station&quot; in July 1977. The band&#x27;s tour in the spring of that year is held in high regard by its fans, and its concert of May 8 at Cornell University is often considered one of the best performances of its career. Their September 1977 concert at Raceway Park in Old Bridge Township, New Jersey was attended by 107,019 people and held the record for largest-ticketed concert in the United States by a single act for 47 years.

Keith and Donna Jean Godchaux left the band in February 1979, citing artistic differences.

=== Mydland/Welnick era (1979–1995) ===

Following the Godchauxs&#x27; departure, Brent Mydland joined as keyboardist and vocalist and was considered &quot;the perfect fit.&quot; The Godchauxs then formed the Heart of Gold Band, before Keith died in a car accident in July 1980. Mydland was the keyboardist for the Grateful Dead for 11 years until his death by narcotics overdose in July 1990, becoming the third keyboardist to die.

Shortly after Mydland found his place in the early 1980s, Garcia&#x27;s health began to decline. He became a frequent smoker of &quot;Persian,&quot; a type of heroin, and he gained weight at a rapid pace. He lost his liveliness on stage, his voice was strained, and Deadheads worried for his health. After he began to curtail his opiate usage gradually in 1985, Garcia slipped into a diabetic coma for several days in July 1986, leading to the cancelation of all concerts in the fall of that year. Garcia recovered, the band released &quot;In the Dark&quot; in July 1987, which became its best-selling studio album and produced its only top-40 single, &quot;Touch of Grey,&quot; Also, that year, the group toured with Bob Dylan, as heard on the album &quot;Dylan &amp; the Dead&quot;.

Mydland died in July 1990 and Vince Welnick, former keyboardist for the Tubes, joined as a band member, while Bruce Hornsby, who had a successful career with his band the Range, joined temporarily as a bridge to help Welnick learn songs. Both performed on keyboards and vocals—Welnick until the band&#x27;s end, and Hornsby mainly from 1990 to 1992.

Saxophonist Branford Marsalis played five concerts with the band between 1990 and 1994. 

The Grateful Dead performed its final concert on July 9, 1995, at Soldier Field in Chicago.

==Aftermath (1995–present)==


Jerry Garcia died on August 9, 1995. A few months after Garcia&#x27;s death, the remaining members of the Grateful Dead decided to disband. Since that time, there have been a number of reunions by the surviving members involving various combinations of musicians. Additionally, the former members have also begun or continued individual projects.

In 1998, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, and Mickey Hart, along with several other musicians, formed a band called the Other Ones, and performed a number of concerts that year, releasing a live album, &quot;The Strange Remain&quot;, the following year. In 2000, the Other Ones toured again, this time with Kreutzmann but without Lesh. After taking another year off, the band toured again in 2002 with Lesh. That year, the Other Ones then included all four living former Grateful Dead members who had been in the band for most or all of its history. At different times the shifting lineup of the Other Ones also included guitarists Mark Karan, Steve Kimock, and Jimmy Herring, keyboardists Bruce Hornsby, Jeff Chimenti, and Rob Barraco, saxophonist Dave Ellis, drummer John Molo, bassist Alphonso Johnson, and vocalist Susan Tedeschi.

In 2003, the Other Ones, still including Weir, Lesh, Hart, and Kreutzmann, changed their name to the Dead. The Dead toured the United States in 2003, 2004 and 2009. The band&#x27;s lineups included Jimmy Herring and Warren Haynes on guitar, Jeff Chimenti and Rob Barraco on keyboards, and Joan Osborne on vocals. In 2008, members of the Dead played two concerts, called &quot;Deadheads for Obama&quot; and &quot;Change Rocks&quot;.

Following the 2009 Dead tour, Lesh and Weir formed the band Furthur, which debuted in September 2009. Joining Lesh and Weir in Furthur were Chimenti (keyboards), John Kadlecik (guitar), Joe Russo (drums), Jay Lane (drums), Sunshine Becker (vocals), and Zoe Ellis (vocals). Lane and Ellis left the band in 2010, and vocalist Jeff Pehrson joined later that year. Furthur disbanded in 2014.

In 2010, Hart and Kreutzmann re-formed the Rhythm Devils, and played a summer concert tour. In the fall of 2015, Hart, Kreutzmann and Weir teamed up with Chimenti, guitarist John Mayer, and bassist Oteil Burbridge to form a band called Dead &amp; Company. Mayer recounted that in 2011 he was listening to Pandora and happened upon the Grateful Dead song &quot;Althea&quot;, and that soon Grateful Dead music was all he would listen to. Dead &amp; Company toured every year (except 2020), until announcing that their summer 2023 tour, which saw Kreutzmann replaced by Lane, would be their last. However, they later clarified that it was only their last &quot;tour&quot;, and they continue to perform concerts.

Since 1995, the former members of the Grateful Dead have also pursued solo music careers. Both Bob Weir &amp; RatDog and Phil Lesh and Friends have performed many concerts and released several albums. Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann have also each released a few albums. Hart has toured with his world music percussion ensemble Planet Drum as well as the Mickey Hart Band. Kreutzmann has led several different bands, including BK3, 7 Walkers (with Papa Mali), and Billy &amp; the Kids. Donna Godchaux has returned to the music scene, with the Donna Jean Godchaux Band, and Tom Constanten also continues to write and perform music. All of these groups continue to play Grateful Dead music.

In October 2014, it was announced that Martin Scorsese would produce a documentary film about the Grateful Dead, to be directed by Amir Bar-Lev. David Lemieux supervised the musical selection, and Weir, Hart, Kreutzmann, and Lesh agreed to new interviews for the film. Bar-Lev&#x27;s four-hour documentary, titled &quot;Long Strange Trip&quot;, was released in 2017.

Barlow died in 2018 and Hunter in 2019. Lesh died in 2024.

===&quot;Fare Thee Well&quot;===

In 2015, Weir, Lesh, Kreutzmann, and Hart reunited for five concerts called &quot;Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead&quot;. The shows were performed on June 27 and 28 at Levi&#x27;s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, and on July 3, 4 and 5 at Soldier Field in Chicago. The band stated that this would be the final time that Weir, Lesh, Hart, and Kreutzmann would perform together. They were joined by Trey Anastasio of Phish on guitar, Jeff Chimenti on keyboards, and Bruce Hornsby on piano. Demand for tickets was very high. The concerts were simulcast via various media. The Chicago shows have been released as a box set of CDs and DVDs.

==Musical style==

The Grateful Dead formed during the era when bands such as the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones were dominating the airwaves. &quot;The Beatles were why we turned from a jug band into a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band&quot;, said Bob Weir. &quot;What we saw them doing was impossibly attractive. I couldn&#x27;t think of anything else more worth doing.&quot; Former folk-scene star Bob Dylan had recently put out a couple of records featuring electric instrumentation. Grateful Dead members have said that it was after attending a concert by the touring New York City band the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful that they decided to &quot;go electric&quot; and look for a &quot;dirtier&quot; sound. Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir (both of whom had been immersed in the American folk music revival of the late 1950s and early 1960s), were open-minded about the use of electric guitars.

The Grateful Dead&#x27;s early music (in the mid-1960s) was part of the process of establishing what &quot;psychedelic music&quot; was, but theirs was essentially a &quot;street party&quot; form of it. They developed their &quot;psychedelic&quot; playing as a result of meeting Ken Kesey in Palo Alto, California, and subsequently becoming the house band for the Acid Tests he staged. They did not fit their music to an established category such as pop rock, blues, folk rock, or country &amp; western. Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew on all of these genres and, more frequently, melded several of them. Bill Graham said of the Grateful Dead, &quot;They&#x27;re not the best at what they do, they&#x27;re the only ones that do what they do.&quot; Academics Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell argued that the Grateful Dead were &quot;not merely as precursors of prog but as essential developments of progressiveness in its early days&quot;. Often (both in performance and on recording) the Dead left room for exploratory, spacey soundscapes.

Their live shows, fed by an improvisational approach to music, were different from most touring bands. While rock and roll bands often rehearse a standard set, played with minor variations, the Grateful Dead did not prepare in this way. Garcia stated in a 1966 interview, &quot;We don&#x27;t make up our sets beforehand. We&#x27;d rather work off the tops of our heads than off a piece of paper.&quot; They maintained this approach throughout their career. For each performance, the band drew material from an active list of a hundred or so songs.

The 1969 live album &quot;Live/Dead&quot; did capture the band in-form, but commercial success did not come until &quot;Workingman&#x27;s Dead&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot;, both released in 1970. These records largely featured the band&#x27;s laid-back acoustic musicianship and more traditional song structures. With their rootsy, eclectic stylings, particularly evident on the latter two albums, the band pioneered the hybrid Americana genre.

=== Instrumentation and musicianship ===

As the band and its sound matured over thirty years of touring, playing, and recording, each member&#x27;s stylistic contribution became more defined, consistent, and identifiable. Garcia&#x27;s lead lines were fluid, supple and spare, owing a great deal of their character to his experience playing Scruggs style banjo, an approach which often makes use of note syncopation, accenting, arpeggios, staccato chromatic runs, and the anticipation of the downbeat. 

Garcia had a distinctive sense of timing, often weaving in and out of the groove established by the rest of the band as if he were pushing the beat. His lead lines were also immensely influenced by jazz soloists: Garcia cited Miles Davis, Ornette Coleman, Bill Evans, Pat Martino, George Benson, Al Di Meola, Art Tatum, Duke Ellington, and Django Reinhardt as primary influences, and frequently utilized techniques common to country and blues music in songs that called back to those traditions. 

Garcia often switched scales in the midst of a solo depending upon the chord changes played underneath, though he nearly always finished phrases by landing on the chord-tones. Jerry most frequently played in the Mixolydian mode, though his solos and phrases often incorporated notes from the Dorian and major/minor pentatonic scales. Particularly in the late 1960s, Garcia occasionally incorporated melodic lines derived from Indian ragas into the band&#x27;s extended, psychedelic improvisation, likely inspired by John Coltrane and other jazz artists&#x27; interest in the sitar music of Ravi Shankar.

Lesh was originally a classically trained trumpet player with an extensive background in music theory, but did not tend to play traditional blues-based bass forms. He often played more melodic, symphonic and complex lines, often sounding like a second lead guitar. In contrast to most bassists in popular music, Lesh often avoids playing the root of a chord on the downbeat, instead withholding as a means to build tension. Lesh also rarely repeats the same bassline, even from performance to performance of the same song, and often plays off of or around the other instruments with a syncopated, staccato bounce that contributes to the Dead&#x27;s unique rhythmic character.

Weir, too, was not a traditional rhythm guitarist, but tended to play unique inversions at the upper end of the Dead&#x27;s sound. Weir modeled his style of playing after jazz pianist McCoy Tyner and attempted to replicate the interplay between John Coltrane and Tyner in his support, and occasional subversion, of the harmonic structure of Garcia&#x27;s voice leadings. This would often influence the direction the band&#x27;s improvisation would take on a given night. Weir and Garcia&#x27;s respective positions as rhythm and lead guitarist were not always strictly adhered to, as Weir would often incorporate short melodic phrases into his playing to support Garcia and occasionally took solos, often played with a slide. Weir&#x27;s playing is characterized by a &quot;spiky, staccato&quot; sound.

The band&#x27;s two drummers, Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, developed a unique, complex interplay, balancing Kreutzmann&#x27;s steady shuffle beat with Hart&#x27;s interest in percussion styles outside the rock tradition. Kreuzmann has said, &quot;I like to establish a feeling and then add radical or oblique juxtapositions to that feeling.&quot; Hart incorporated an 11-count measure to his drumming, bringing a dimension to the band&#x27;s sound that became an important part of its style. He had studied tabla drumming and incorporated rhythms and instruments from world music, and later electronic music, into the band&#x27;s live performances.

The Dead&#x27;s live performances featured multiple types of improvisation derived from a vast array of musical traditions. Not unlike many rock bands of their time, the majority of the Dead&#x27;s songs feature a designated section in which an instrumental break occurs over the chord changes. These sections typically feature solos by Garcia that often originate as variations on the song&#x27;s melody, but go on to create dynamic phrases that resolve by returning to the chord-tones. Not unlike traditional improvisational jazz, they may occasionally feature several solos by multiple instruments within an undecided number of bars, such as a keyboardist, before returning to the melody. At the same time, Dead shows almost always feature a more collective, modal approach to improvisation that typically occurs during segues between songs before the band modulates to a new tonal center. Some of the Dead&#x27;s more extended jam vehicles, such as &quot;The Other One&quot;, &quot;Dark Star&quot;, and &quot;Playing in the Band&quot; almost exclusively make use of modulation between modes to accompany simple two-chord progressions.

=== Lyrical themes ===
Following the songwriting renaissance that defined the band&#x27;s early 1970s period, as reflected in the albums &quot;Workingman&#x27;s Dead&quot; and &quot;American Beauty,&quot; Robert Hunter, Jerry Garcia&#x27;s primary lyrical partner, frequently made use of motifs common to American folklore including trains, guns, elements, traditional musical instruments, gambling, murder, animals, alcohol, descriptions of American geography, and religious symbolism to illustrate themes involving love and loss, life and death, beauty and horror, and chaos and order. Following in the footsteps of several American musical traditions, these songs are often confessional and feature narration from the perspective of an antihero. Critic Robert Christgau described them as &quot;American myths&quot; that later gave way to &quot;the old karma-go-round&quot;. 

An extremely common feature in both Robert Hunter&#x27;s lyrics, as well as the band&#x27;s visual iconography, is the presence of dualistic and opposing imagery illustrating the dynamic range of the human experience (Heaven and hell, law and crime, dark and light, etc.). Hunter and Garcia&#x27;s earlier, more directly psychedelic-influenced compositions often make use of surreal imagery, nonsense, and whimsey reflective of traditions in English poetry. In a retrospective, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described Hunter&#x27;s verses as &quot;elliptical, by turns vivid and gnomic&quot;, which were often &quot;hippie poetry about roses and bells and dew&quot;. Grateful Dead biographer Dennis McNally has described Hunter&#x27;s lyrics as creating &quot;a non-literal hyper-Americana&quot; weaving a psychedelic, kaleidoscopic tapestry in the hopes of elucidating America&#x27;s national character. At least one of Hunter and Bob Weir&#x27;s collaborations, &quot;Jack Straw&quot;, was inspired by the work of John Steinbeck.

==Influence and legacy==
Grateful Dead have been called a &quot;symbol of the counterculture movement of the sixties&quot;. Beginning in the early 1990s, a new generation of bands became inspired by the Grateful Dead&#x27;s improvisational ethos and marketing strategy, and began to incorporate elements of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s live performances into their own shows. These include the nightly alteration of setlists, frequent improvisation, the blending of genres, and the allowance of taping, which would often contribute to the development of a dedicated fanbase. Bands associated with the expansion of the &quot;jam scene&quot; include Phish, The String Cheese Incident, Widespread Panic, Blues Traveler, moe., and the Disco Biscuits. Many of these groups began to look past the American roots music that the Grateful Dead drew inspiration from, and incorporated elements of progressive rock, hard rock, and electronica. At the same time, the Internet gained popularity and provided a medium for fans to discuss these bands and their performances and download MP3s. The Grateful Dead, as well as Phish, were one of the first bands to have a Usenet newsgroup.

==Merchandising and representation==
Hal Kant was an entertainment industry attorney who specialized in representing musical groups. He spent 35 years as principal lawyer and general counsel for the Grateful Dead, a position in the group that was so strong that his business cards with the band identified his role as &quot;Czar&quot;.

Kant brought the band millions of dollars in revenue through his management of the band&#x27;s intellectual property and merchandising rights. At Kant&#x27;s recommendation, the group was one of the few rock &#x27;n roll pioneers to retain ownership of their music masters and publishing rights.

In 2006, the Grateful Dead signed a ten-year licensing agreement with Rhino Entertainment to manage the band&#x27;s business interests including the release of musical recordings, merchandising, and marketing. The band retained creative control and kept ownership of its music catalog.

A Grateful Dead video game titled &quot;Grateful Dead Game – The Epic Tour&quot; was released in April 2012 and was created by Curious Sense.

In November 2022, the children&#x27;s book &quot;The ABCs of The Grateful Dead&quot; was released. Authorized by the group, it was written by Howie Abrams, illustrated by Michael &quot;Kaves&quot; McLeer, and published by Simon &amp; Schuster.

===Sponsorship of 1992 Lithuanian Olympic basketball team===

After Lithuania gained its independence from the USSR, the country announced its withdrawal from the 1992 Olympics due to the lack of any money to sponsor participants. But NBA star Šarūnas Marčiulionis, a native Lithuanian basketball star, wanted to help his native team to compete. His efforts resulted in a call from representatives of the Grateful Dead who set up a meeting with the band members. The band agreed to fund transportation costs for the team (about $5,000) along with Grateful Dead designs for the team&#x27;s jerseys and shorts. The Lithuanian basketball team won the bronze medal and the Lithuanian basketball/Grateful Dead T-shirts became part of pop culture, especially in Lithuania. The incident was covered by the documentary &quot;The Other Dream Team&quot;.

==Live performances==
The Grateful Dead toured constantly throughout their career, playing more than 2,300 concerts. They promoted a sense of community among their fans, who became known as &quot;Deadheads&quot;, many of whom followed their tours for months or years on end. Around concert venues, an impromptu communal marketplace known as &#x27;Shakedown Street&#x27; was created by Deadheads to serve as centers of activity where fans could buy and sell anything from grilled cheese sandwiches to home-made t-shirts and recordings of Grateful Dead concerts.

In their early career, the band also dedicated their time and talents to their community, the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco, making available free food, lodging, music, and health care to all. It has been said that the band performed &quot;more free concerts than any band in the history of music&quot;.

With the exception of 1975, when the band was on hiatus and played only four concerts, Grateful Dead performed many concerts every year, from their formation in April 1965, until July 9, 1995. Initially all their shows were in California, principally in the San Francisco Bay Area and in or near Los Angeles. They also performed, in 1965 and 1966, with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, as the house band for the Acid Tests. 

In 1967, they toured nationally, including their first performance in New York City. They appeared at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Festival Express train tour across Canada in 1970. They were scheduled to appear as the final act at the infamous Altamont Free Concert on December 6, 1969, after the Rolling Stones but withdrew after security concerns. &quot;That&#x27;s the way things went at Altamont—so badly that the Grateful Dead, prime organizers and movers of the festival, didn&#x27;t even get to play&quot;, staff at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine wrote in a detailed narrative on the event.

Their first UK performance was at the Hollywood Music Festival in 1970. Their largest concert audience came in 1973 when they played, along with the Allman Brothers Band and the Band, before an estimated 600,000 people at the Summer Jam at Watkins Glen. They played to an estimated total of 25 million people, more than any other band, with audiences of up to 80,000 attending a single show. Many of these concerts were preserved in the band&#x27;s tape vault, and several dozen have since been released on CD and as downloads. The Dead were known for the tremendous variation in their setlists from night to night—the list of songs documented to have been played by the band exceeds 500. The band has released four concert videos under the name &quot;View from the Vault&quot;. In 1978, they played three nights at the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. 

In the 1990s, the Grateful Dead earned a total of $285 million in revenue from their concert tours, the second-highest during the 1990s, with the Rolling Stones earning the most. This figure is representative of tour revenue through 1995, as touring stopped after the death of Jerry Garcia. 

In a 1991 PBS documentary, segment host Buck Henry attended an August 1991 concert at Shoreline Amphitheatre and gleaned some information from some band members about the Grateful Dead phenomenon and its success. At the time, Jerry Garcia stated, &quot;We didn&#x27;t really invent the Grateful Dead, the crowd invented the Grateful Dead, you know what I mean? We were sort of standing in line, and uh, it&#x27;s gone way past our expectations, way past, so it&#x27;s, we&#x27;ve been going along with it to see what it&#x27;s gonna do next.&quot; Mickey Hart said, &quot;This is one of the last places in America that you can really have this kind of fun, you know, considering the political climate and so forth.&quot; Hart also stated that &quot;the transformative power of the Grateful Dead is really the essence of it; it&#x27;s what it can do to your consciousness. We&#x27;re more into &quot;transportation&quot; than we are into music, &quot;per se&quot;, I mean, the business of the Grateful Dead is transportation.&quot; One of the band&#x27;s largest concerts took place just months before Garcia&#x27;s death — at their outdoor show with Bob Dylan in Highgate, Vermont, on June 15, 1995. The crowd was estimated to be over 90,000; overnight camping was allowed and about a third of the audience got in without having purchased a ticket.

Their numerous studio albums were generally collections of new songs that they had first played in concert. The band was also famous for its extended musical improvisations, having been described as having never played the same song the same way twice. Their concert sets often blended songs, one into the next, often for more than three songs at a time.

===Concert sound systems===
The Wall of Sound was a large sound system designed specifically for the band. The band was never satisfied with the house system anywhere they played. After the Monterey Pop Festival, the band&#x27;s crew &#x27;borrowed&#x27; some of the other performers&#x27; sound equipment and used it to host some free shows in San Francisco. In their early days, soundman Owsley &quot;Bear&quot; Stanley designed a public address (PA) and monitor system for them. Stanley was the Grateful Dead&#x27;s soundman for many years; he was also one of the largest suppliers of LSD. 

Stanley&#x27;s sound systems were delicate and finicky, and frequently brought shows to a halt with technical breakdowns. After Stanley went to jail for manufacturing LSD in 1970, the group briefly used house PAs, but found them to be even less reliable than those built by their former soundman. On February 2, 1970, the group contacted Bob Heil to use his system. In 1971, the band purchased their first solid-state sound system from Alembic Studios. Because of this, Alembic would play an integral role in the research, development, and production of the Wall of Sound. The band also welcomed Dan Healy into the fold on a permanent basis that year. Healy would mix the Grateful Dead&#x27;s live sound until 1993.

Following Jerry Garcia&#x27;s death and the band&#x27;s breakup in 1995, their current sound system was inherited by Dave Matthews Band. Dave Matthews Band debuted the sound system April 30, 1996, at the first show of their 1996 tour in Richmond, Virginia.

===Tapes===
Like several other bands at the time, the Grateful Dead allowed their fans to record their shows. For many years the tapers set up their microphones wherever they could, and the eventual forest of microphones became a problem for the sound crew. Eventually, this was solved by having a dedicated taping section located behind the soundboard, which required a special &quot;tapers&quot; ticket. The band allowed sharing of their shows, as long as no profits were made on the sale of the tapes.

Of the approximately 2,350 shows the Grateful Dead played, almost 2,200 were taped, and most of these are available online. The band began collecting and cataloging tapes early on and Dick Latvala was their keeper. &quot;Dick&#x27;s Picks&quot; is named after Latvala. After his death in 1999, David Lemieux gradually took the post. Concert set lists from a subset of 1,590 Grateful Dead shows were used to perform a comparative analysis between how songs were played in concert and how they are listened online by Last.fm members. In their book &quot;Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead: What Every Business Can Learn From the Most Iconic Band in History&quot;, David Meerman Scott and Brian Halligan identify the taper section as a crucial contributor to increasing the Grateful Dead&#x27;s fan base.

==Iconography==

Over the years, a number of iconic images have come to be associated with the Grateful Dead. Many of these images originated as artwork for concert posters or album covers.

;Skull and Roses
:The skull and roses design was composed by Alton Kelley and Stanley Mouse, who added lettering and color, respectively, to a black and white drawing by Edmund Joseph Sullivan. Sullivan&#x27;s drawing was an illustration for a 1913 edition of the &quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot;. Earlier antecedents include the custom of exhibiting the relic skulls of Christian martyrs decorated with roses on their feast days. The rose is an attribute of Saint Valentine, who according to one legend, was martyred by decapitation. Accordingly, in Rome, at the church dedicated to him, the observance of his feast day included the display of his skull surrounded by roses. Kelley and Mouse&#x27;s design originally appeared on a poster for the September 16 and 17, 1966, Dead shows at the Avalon Ballroom. Later, it was used as the cover for the album &quot;Grateful Dead&quot; (1971). The album is sometimes referred to as &quot;Skull and Roses&quot;.

;Jester
:Another icon of the Dead is a skeleton dressed as a jester and holding a lute. This image was an airbrush painting, created by Stanley Mouse in 1972. It was originally used for the cover of &quot;The Grateful Dead Songbook&quot;.

;&quot;Dancing&quot; Bears
:A series of stylized bears who appear to be dancing was drawn by Bob Thomas as part of the back cover for the album &quot;History of the Grateful Dead, Volume One (Bear&#x27;s Choice)&quot; (1973). Thomas reported that he based the bears on a lead sort from an unknown font. The bear is a reference to Owsley &quot;Bear&quot; Stanley, who recorded and produced the album. Bear himself wrote, &quot;the bears on the album cover are not really &#x27;dancing&#x27;. I don&#x27;t know why people think they are; their positions are quite obviously those of a high-stepping march.&quot;

;&quot;Steal Your Face&quot; Skull
:Perhaps the best-known Grateful Dead art icon is a red, white, and blue skull with a lightning bolt through it. The lightning bolt skull can be found on the cover of the album &quot;Steal Your Face&quot; (1976), and the image is sometimes known by that name. It was designed by Owsley Stanley and artist Bob Thomas, and was originally used as a logo to mark the band&#x27;s equipment.

;Dancing Terrapins
:The two dancing terrapins first appeared on the cover of the album &quot;Terrapin Station&quot; (1977). They were drawn by Kelley and Mouse, based on a drawing by Heinrich Kley. Since then these turtles have become one of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s most recognizable logos.

;Uncle Sam Skeleton
:The Uncle Sam skeleton was devised by Gary Gutierrez as part of the animation for &quot;The Grateful Dead Movie&quot; (1977). The image combines the Grateful Dead skeleton motif with the character of Uncle Sam, a reference to the then-recently written song &quot;U.S. Blues&quot;, which plays during the animation.

==Deadheads==
Fans and enthusiasts of the band are commonly referred to as Deadheads. While the origin of the term may be unclear, &quot;Dead Heads&quot; were made canon by the notice placed inside the &quot;Skull and Roses&quot; (1971) album by manager Jon McIntire:
As each show featured a new setlist and a great deal of improvisation, Deadheads would often follow the band from city to city, attending many shows on a given tour. Many Deadheads speak of being drawn to the culture due to the sense of community that the band&#x27;s shows tended to foster. Though Deadheads came from a wide array of demographics, many attempted to reproduce the aesthetics and values of the 1960s counterculture and were often stigmatized in the media. Because of the stereotyping of Deadheads as hippies, the band&#x27;s shows became a common target for officials in the DEA and arrests at shows became common. 

As a group, the Deadheads were considered very mellow. &quot;I&#x27;d rather work nine Grateful Dead concerts than one Oregon football game,&quot; Police Det. Rick Raynor said. &quot;They don&#x27;t get belligerent like they do at the games.&quot; Despite this reputation, in the mid-1990s, as the band&#x27;s popularity grew, there were a series of minor scuffles occurring at shows that peaked with a large scale riot at the Deer Creek Music Center near Indianapolis in July 1995. This gate crashing incident caused the band to cancel the following night&#x27;s show. Deadheads who appeared on the scene after the band&#x27;s 1987 hit single &quot;Touch of Grey&quot;, were often disparagingly referred to by older fans as &quot;Touchheads&quot;. Beginning in the 1980s, a number of definable sects of Deadheads began to appear on the scene. These included the Wharf Rats, as well as the &quot;spinners&quot;, named for whirling-style of dancing and their use of the band&#x27;s music to facilitate mystical experiences.

Deadheads, particularly those who collected tapes, were known for keeping close records of the band&#x27;s setlists and for comparing various live versions of the band&#x27;s songs, as reflected in publications such as the various editions of &quot;Deadbase&quot; and &quot;The Deadhead&#x27;s Taping Compendium&quot;. This practice continues into the 21st century on digital forums and websites such as the Internet Archive, which features live recordings of nearly every available Grateful Dead show and allows users to discuss and review the site&#x27;s shows.

The band has a number of influential and celebrity fans, including politicians, businesspeople, journalists, and other musicians.

==Donation of archives to UC Santa Cruz==
On April 24, 2008, members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, along with Nion McEvoy, CEO of Chronicle Books, UC Santa Cruz chancellor George Blumenthal, and UC Santa Cruz librarian Virginia Steel, held a press conference announcing UCSC&#x27;s McHenry Library would be the permanent home of the Grateful Dead Archive, which includes a complete archival history from 1965 to the present. The archive includes correspondence, photographs, fliers, posters, and several other forms of memorabilia and records of the band. Also included are unreleased videos of interviews and TV appearances that will be installed for visitors to view, as well as stage backdrops and other props from the band&#x27;s concerts.

Blumenthal stated at the event, &quot;The Grateful Dead Archive represents one of the most significant popular cultural collections of the 20th century; UC Santa Cruz is honored to receive this invaluable gift. The Grateful Dead and UC Santa Cruz are both highly innovative institutions—born the same year—that continue to make a major, positive impact on the world.&quot; Guitarist Bob Weir stated &quot;We looked around, and UC Santa Cruz seems the best possible home. If you ever wrote the Grateful Dead a letter, you&#x27;ll probably find it there!&quot;

Professor of music Fredric Lieberman was the key contact between the band and the university, who let the university know about the search for a home for the archive, and who had collaborated with Mickey Hart on three books in the past, &quot;Planet Drum&quot; (1990), &quot;Drumming at the Edge of Magic&quot; (1991), and &quot;Spirit into Sound&quot; (2006).

The first large-scale exhibition of materials from the Grateful Dead Archive was mounted at the New-York Historical Society in 2010.

==Awards==
In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the Grateful Dead No. 57 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

On February 10, 2007, the Grateful Dead received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. The award was accepted on behalf of the band by Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann.

In 2011, a recording of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s May 8, 1977, concert at Cornell University&#x27;s Barton Hall was selected for induction into the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress.

Twelve members of the Grateful Dead (the eleven official performing members plus Robert Hunter) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, and Bruce Hornsby was their presenter.

In 2024 the band was named as one of the recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors. The three living core members (Weir, Hart and Kreutzmann) received the award. As he was named a recipient prior to his death, Lesh received the award posthumously.

Lead guitarist Jerry Garcia was often viewed both by the public and the media as the leader or primary spokesperson for the Grateful Dead, but was reluctant to be perceived that way, especially since he and the other group members saw themselves as equal participants and contributors to their collective musical and creative output. Garcia, a native of San Francisco, grew up in the Excelsior District. One of his main influences was bluegrass music, and he also performed—on banjo, one of his other great instrumental loves, along with the pedal steel guitar—in bluegrass bands, notably Old &amp; In the Way with mandolinist David Grisman.

Ned Lagin, a young MIT student and friend of the band, guested with them many times from 1970 through 1975, providing a second keyboard as well as synthesizers. Upon graduating from MIT, he began touring with the band fulltime in 1974, performing sets of electronic music with Phil Lesh, occasionally with Garcia and Kreutzmann, during the band&#x27;s intermission. The &quot;Ned and Phil&quot; set became a regular fixture of that era, and was featured nearly every night during their Summer &#x27;74 and Europe &#x27;74 tours, as well as their five-night residency at the Winterland Ballroom during October 1974. Lagin is also featured in &quot;The Grateful Dead Movie&quot;. During 1974 and 1975, he would also occasionally play entire sets with the band, usually on Garcia&#x27;s side of the stage, before ending his touring relationship with the band and focusing on his solo music projects, such as his album &quot;Seastones&quot;, which features several members of the Dead.

Bruce Hornsby never officially joined the band full-time because of his other commitments, but he did play keyboards at most Dead shows between September 1990 and March 1992, and sat in with the band over 100 times in all between 1988 and 1995. He added several Dead songs to his own live shows and Jerry Garcia referred to him as a &quot;floating member&quot; who could come and go as he pleased.

Robert Hunter and John Perry Barlow were the band&#x27;s primary lyricists, starting in 1967 and 1971, respectively, and continuing until the band&#x27;s dissolution. Hunter collaborated mostly with Garcia and Barlow mostly with Weir, though each wrote with other band members as well. Both are listed as official members at Dead.net, the band&#x27;s website, alongside the performing members. Barlow was the only member not inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

<text>In mathematics, especially in category theory and homotopy theory, a groupoid (less often Brandt groupoid or virtual group) generalises the notion of group in several equivalent ways. A groupoid can be seen as a:
* &quot;Group&quot; with a partial function replacing the binary operation;
* &quot;Category&quot; in which every morphism is invertible. A category of this sort can be viewed as augmented with a unary operation on the morphisms, called &quot;inverse&quot; by analogy with group theory. A groupoid where there is only one object is a usual group.

In the presence of dependent typing, a category in general can be viewed as a typed monoid, and similarly, a groupoid can be viewed as simply a typed group. The morphisms take one from one object to another, and form a dependent family of types, thus morphisms might be typed , , say. Composition is then a total function: , so that .

Special cases include:
* &quot;Setoids&quot;: sets that come with an equivalence relation,
* &quot;G-sets&quot;: sets equipped with an action of a group .

Groupoids are often used to reason about geometrical objects such as manifolds. introduced groupoids implicitly via Brandt semigroups.

== Definitions ==

=== Algebraic ===

A groupoid can be viewed as an algebraic structure consisting of a set with a binary partial function .
Precisely, it is a non-empty set formula_1 with a unary operation , and a partial function . Here formula_2 is not a binary operation because it is not necessarily defined for all pairs of elements of . The precise conditions under which formula_2 is defined are not articulated here and vary by situation.

The operations formula_4 and −1 have the following axiomatic properties: For all , , and formula_5 in ,
# &quot;Associativity&quot;: If formula_6 and formula_7 are defined, then formula_8 and formula_9 are defined and are equal. Conversely, if one of formula_8 or formula_9 is defined, then they are both defined (and they are equal to each other), and formula_6 and formula_13 are also defined.
# &quot;Inverse&quot;: formula_14 and formula_15 are always defined.
# &quot;Identity&quot;: If formula_16 is defined, then , and . (The previous two axioms already show that these expressions are defined and unambiguous.)

Two easy and convenient properties follow from these axioms:
* If formula_16 is defined, then .

=== Category-theoretic ===
A groupoid is a small category in which every morphism is an isomorphism, i.e., invertible. More explicitly, a groupoid formula_1 is a set formula_19 of &quot;objects&quot; with
* for each pair of objects &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, a (possibly empty) set &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) of &quot;morphisms&quot; (or &quot;arrows&quot;) from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot;; we write &quot;f&quot; : &quot;x&quot; → &quot;y&quot; to indicate that &quot;f&quot; is an element of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;);
* for every object &quot;x&quot;, a designated element formula_20 of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;);
* for each triple of objects &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot;, a function ;
* for each pair of objects &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, a function formula_21 satisfying, for any &quot;f&quot; : &quot;x&quot; → &quot;y&quot;, &quot;g&quot; : &quot;y&quot; → &quot;z&quot;, and &quot;h&quot; : &quot;z&quot; → &quot;w&quot;:
** and ;
** formula_22 and .

If &quot;f&quot; is an element of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;), then &quot;x&quot; is called the source of &quot;f&quot;, written &quot;s&quot;(&quot;f&quot;), and &quot;y&quot; is called the target of &quot;f&quot;, written &quot;t&quot;(&quot;f&quot;).

A groupoid &quot;G&quot; is sometimes denoted as , where formula_23 is the set of all morphisms, and the two arrows formula_24 represent the source and the target.

More generally, one can consider a groupoid object in an arbitrary category admitting finite fiber products.

=== Comparing the definitions ===
The algebraic and category-theoretic definitions are equivalent, as we now show. Given a groupoid in the category-theoretic sense, let &quot;G&quot; be the disjoint union of all of the sets &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) (i.e. the sets of morphisms from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot;). Then formula_25 and formula_26 become partial operations on &quot;G&quot;, and formula_26 will in fact be defined everywhere. We define ∗ to be formula_25 and −1 to be , which gives a groupoid in the algebraic sense. Explicit reference to &quot;G&quot;0 (and hence to ) can be dropped.

Conversely, given a groupoid &quot;G&quot; in the algebraic sense, define an equivalence relation formula_29 on its elements by
formula_30 iff &quot;a&quot; ∗ &quot;a&quot;−1 = &quot;b&quot; ∗ &quot;b&quot;−1. Let &quot;G&quot;0 be the set of equivalence classes of , i.e. . Denote &quot;a&quot; ∗ &quot;a&quot;−1 by formula_31 if formula_32 with .

Now define formula_33 as the set of all elements &quot;f&quot; such that formula_34 exists. Given formula_35 and , their composite is defined as . To see that this is well defined, observe that since formula_36 and formula_37 exist, so does . The identity morphism on &quot;x&quot; is then , and the category-theoretic inverse of &quot;f&quot; is &quot;f&quot;−1.

Sets in the definitions above may be replaced with classes, as is generally the case in category theory.

=== Vertex groups and orbits ===
Given a groupoid &quot;G&quot;, the vertex groups or isotropy groups or object groups in &quot;G&quot; are the subsets of the form &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;x&quot;), where &quot;x&quot; is any object of &quot;G&quot;. It follows easily from the axioms above that these are indeed groups, as every pair of elements is composable and inverses are in the same vertex group.

The orbit of a groupoid &quot;G&quot; at a point formula_38 is given by the set formula_39 containing every point that can be joined to x by a morphism in G. If two points formula_40 and formula_41 are in the same orbits, their vertex groups formula_42 and formula_43 are isomorphic: if formula_44 is any morphism from formula_40 to , then the isomorphism is given by the mapping .

Orbits form a partition of the set X, and a groupoid is called transitive if it has only one orbit (equivalently, if it is connected as a category). In that case, all the vertex groups are isomorphic (on the other hand, this is not a sufficient condition for transitivity; see the section below for counterexamples).

=== Subgroupoids and morphisms ===
A subgroupoid of formula_46 is a subcategory formula_47 that is itself a groupoid. It is called wide or full if it is wide or full as a subcategory, i.e., respectively, if formula_48 or formula_49 for every .

A groupoid morphism is simply a functor between two (category-theoretic) groupoids.

Particular kinds of morphisms of groupoids are of interest. A morphism formula_50 of groupoids is called a fibration if for each object formula_40 of formula_52 and each morphism formula_53 of formula_54 starting at formula_55 there is a morphism formula_56 of formula_52 starting at formula_40 such that . A fibration is called a covering morphism or covering of groupoids if further such an formula_56 is unique. The covering morphisms of groupoids are especially useful because they can be used to model covering maps of spaces.

It is also true that the category of covering morphisms of a given groupoid formula_54 is equivalent to the category of actions of the groupoid formula_54 on sets.

== Examples ==

=== Topology ===

Given a topological space , let formula_19 be the set . The morphisms from the point formula_63 to the point formula_64 are equivalence classes of continuous paths from formula_63 to , with two paths being equivalent if they are homotopic.
Two such morphisms are composed by first following the first path, then the second; the homotopy equivalence guarantees that this composition is associative. This groupoid is called the fundamental groupoid of , denoted formula_66 (or sometimes, ). The usual fundamental group formula_67 is then the vertex group for the point .

The orbits of the fundamental groupoid formula_66 are the path-connected components of . Accordingly, the fundamental groupoid of a path-connected space is transitive, and we recover the known fact that the fundamental groups at any base point are isomorphic. Moreover, in this case, the fundamental groupoid and the fundamental groups are equivalent as categories (see the section below for the general theory).

An important extension of this idea is to consider the fundamental groupoid formula_69 where formula_70 is a chosen set of &quot;base points&quot;. Here formula_69 is a (full) subgroupoid of , where one considers only paths whose endpoints belong to . The set formula_72 may be chosen according to the geometry of the situation at hand.

=== Equivalence relation ===
If formula_73 is a setoid, i.e. a set with an equivalence relation , then a groupoid &quot;representing&quot; this equivalence relation can be formed as follows:
* The objects of the groupoid are the elements of ;
*For any two elements formula_40 and formula_41 in , there is a single morphism from formula_40 to formula_41 (denote by ) if and only if ;
*The composition of formula_78 and formula_79 is .
The vertex groups of this groupoid are always trivial; moreover, this groupoid is in general not transitive and its orbits are precisely the equivalence classes. There are two extreme examples:

* If every element of formula_73 is in relation with every other element of , we obtain the pair groupoid of , which has the entire formula_81 as set of arrows, and which is transitive.
* If every element of formula_73 is only in relation with itself, one obtains the unit groupoid, which has formula_73 as set of arrows, , and which is completely intransitive (every singleton formula_84 is an orbit).

==== Examples ====
* If formula_85 is a smooth surjective submersion of smooth manifolds, then formula_86 is an equivalence relation since formula_87 has a topology isomorphic to the quotient topology of formula_88 under the surjective map of topological spaces. If we write, formula_89 then we get a groupoid formula_90 which is sometimes called the banal groupoid of a surjective submersion of smooth manifolds.
* If we relax the reflexivity requirement and consider &quot;partial equivalence relations&quot;, then it becomes possible to consider semidecidable notions of equivalence on computable realisers for sets. This allows groupoids to be used as a computable approximation to set theory, called &quot;PER models&quot;. Considered as a category, PER models are a cartesian closed category with natural numbers object and subobject classifier, giving rise to the effective topos introduced by Martin Hyland.

=== Čech groupoid ===

A Čech groupoidp. 5 is a special kind of groupoid associated to an equivalence relation given by an open cover formula_91 of some manifold . Its objects are given by the disjoint union
formula_92
and its arrows are the intersections formula_93
The source and target maps are then given by the induced mapsformula_94and the inclusion mapformula_95giving the structure of a groupoid. In fact, this can be further extended by settingformula_96as the formula_97-iterated fiber product where the formula_98 represents formula_97-tuples of composable arrows. The structure map of the fiber product is implicitly the target map, sinceformula_100is a cartesian diagram where the maps to formula_101 are the target maps. This construction can be seen as a model for some ∞-groupoids. Also, another artifact of this construction is k-cocyclesformula_102for some constant sheaf of abelian groups can be represented as a functionformula_103giving an explicit representation of cohomology classes.

=== Group action ===
If the group formula_1 acts on the set , then we can form the action groupoid (or transformation groupoid) representing this group action as follows:
* The objects are the elements of ;
* For any two elements formula_40 and formula_41 in , the morphisms from formula_40 to formula_41 correspond to the elements formula_109 of formula_1 such that ;
* Composition of morphisms interprets the binary operation of .

More explicitly, the &quot;action groupoid&quot; is a small category with formula_111 and formula_112 and with source and target maps formula_113 and . It is often denoted formula_114 (or formula_115 for a right action). Multiplication (or composition) in the groupoid is then , which is defined provided .

For formula_40 in , the vertex group consists of those formula_117 with , which is just the isotropy subgroup at formula_40 for the given action (which is why vertex groups are also called isotropy groups). Similarly, the orbits of the action groupoid are the orbit of the group action, and the groupoid is transitive if and only if the group action is transitive.

Another way to describe formula_1-sets is the functor category , where formula_120 is the groupoid (category) with one element and isomorphic to the group . Indeed, every functor formula_121 of this category defines a set formula_122 and for every formula_109 in formula_1 (i.e. for every morphism in ) induces a bijection formula_125 : . The categorical structure of the functor formula_121 assures us that formula_121 defines a formula_1-action on the set . The (unique) representable functor formula_129 is the Cayley representation of . In fact, this functor is isomorphic to formula_130 and so sends formula_131 to the set formula_132 which is by definition the &quot;set&quot; formula_1 and the morphism formula_109 of formula_120 (i.e. the element formula_109 of ) to the permutation formula_125 of the set . We deduce from the Yoneda embedding that the group formula_1 is isomorphic to the group , a subgroup of the group of permutations of .

==== Finite set ====
Consider the group action of formula_139 on the finite set formula_140 where 1 acts by taking each number to its negative, so formula_141 and . The quotient groupoid formula_142 is the set of equivalence classes from this group action , and formula_143 has a group action of formula_139 on it.

==== Quotient variety ====
Any finite group formula_145 that maps to formula_146 gives a group action on the affine space formula_147 (since this is the group of automorphisms). Then, a quotient groupoid can be of the form , which has one point with stabilizer formula_148 at the origin. Examples like these form the basis for the theory of orbifolds. Another commonly studied family of orbifolds are weighted projective spaces formula_149 and subspaces of them, such as Calabi–Yau orbifolds.

=== Fiber product of groupoids ===
Given a diagram of groupoids with groupoid morphisms
: formula_150
where formula_151 and , we can form the groupoid formula_152 whose objects are triples , where , , and formula_153 in . Morphisms can be defined as a pair of morphisms formula_154 where formula_155 and 
formula_156 such that for triples , there is a commutative diagram in formula_157 of , formula_158 and the .

=== Homological algebra ===
A two term complex
: formula_159
of objects in a concrete Abelian category can be used to form a groupoid. It has as objects the set formula_160 and as arrows the set ; the source morphism is just the projection onto formula_160 while the target morphism is the addition of projection onto formula_162 composed with formula_163 and projection onto . That is, given , we have
: formula_164
Of course, if the abelian category is the category of coherent sheaves on a scheme, then this construction can be used to form a presheaf of groupoids.

=== Puzzles ===

While puzzles such as the Rubik&#x27;s Cube can be modeled using group theory (see Rubik&#x27;s Cube group), certain puzzles are better modeled as groupoids.

The transformations of the fifteen puzzle form a groupoid (not a group, as not all moves can be composed). This groupoid acts on configurations.

=== Mathieu groupoid ===

The Mathieu groupoid is a groupoid introduced by John Horton Conway acting on 13 points such that the elements fixing a point form a copy of the Mathieu group M12.

== Relation to groups ==

If a groupoid has only one object, then the set of its morphisms forms a group. Using the algebraic definition, such a groupoid is literally just a group. Many concepts of group theory generalize to groupoids, with the notion of functor replacing that of group homomorphism.

Every transitive/connected groupoid - that is, as explained above, one in which any two objects are connected by at least one morphism - is isomorphic to an action groupoid (as defined above) . By transitivity, there will only be one orbit under the action.

Note that the isomorphism just mentioned is not unique, and there is no natural choice. Choosing such an isomorphism for a transitive groupoid essentially amounts to picking one object , a group isomorphism formula_165 from formula_166 to , and for each formula_40 other than , a morphism in formula_1 from formula_169 to .

If a groupoid is not transitive, then it is isomorphic to a disjoint union of groupoids of the above type, also called its connected components (possibly with different groups formula_1 and sets formula_73 for each connected component).

In category-theoretic terms, each connected component of a groupoid is equivalent (but not isomorphic) to a groupoid with a single object, that is, a single group. Thus any groupoid is equivalent to a multiset of unrelated groups. In other words, for equivalence instead of isomorphism, one does not need to specify the sets , but only the groups . For example,

*The fundamental groupoid of formula_73 is equivalent to the collection of the fundamental groups of each path-connected component of , but an isomorphism requires specifying the set of points in each component;
*The set formula_73 with the equivalence relation formula_29 is equivalent (as a groupoid) to one copy of the trivial group for each equivalence class, but an isomorphism requires specifying what each equivalence class is;
*The set formula_73 equipped with an action of the group formula_1 is equivalent (as a groupoid) to one copy of formula_1 for each orbit of the action, but an isomorphism requires specifying what set each orbit is.

The collapse of a groupoid into a mere collection of groups loses some information, even from a category-theoretic point of view, because it is not natural. Thus when groupoids arise in terms of other structures, as in the above examples, it can be helpful to maintain the entire groupoid. Otherwise, one must choose a way to view each formula_42 in terms of a single group, and this choice can be arbitrary. In the example from topology, one would have to make a coherent choice of paths (or equivalence classes of paths) from each point formula_63 to each point formula_64 in the same path-connected component.

As a more illuminating example, the classification of groupoids with one endomorphism does not reduce to purely group theoretic considerations. This is analogous to the fact that the classification of vector spaces with one endomorphism is nontrivial.

Morphisms of groupoids come in more kinds than those of groups: we have, for example, fibrations, covering morphisms, universal morphisms, and quotient morphisms. Thus a subgroup formula_181 of a group formula_1 yields an action of formula_1 on the set of cosets of formula_181 in formula_1 and hence a covering morphism formula_63 from, say, formula_187 to , where formula_187 is a groupoid with vertex groups isomorphic to . In this way, presentations of the group formula_1 can be &quot;lifted&quot; to presentations of the groupoid , and this is a useful way of obtaining information about presentations of the subgroup . For further information, see the books by Higgins and by Brown in the References.

== Category of groupoids ==
The category whose objects are groupoids and whose morphisms are groupoid morphisms is called the groupoid category, or the category of groupoids, and is denoted by Grpd.

The category Grpd is, like the category of small categories, Cartesian closed: for any groupoids formula_190 we can construct a groupoid formula_191 whose objects are the morphisms formula_192 and whose arrows are the natural equivalences of morphisms. Thus if formula_193 are just groups, then such arrows are the conjugacies of morphisms. The main result is that for any groupoids formula_194 there is a natural bijection
: formula_195

This result is of interest even if all the groupoids formula_194 are just groups.

Another important property of Grpd is that it is both complete and cocomplete.

=== Relation to Cat ===

The inclusion formula_197 has both a left and a right adjoint:
: formula_198
: formula_199

Here, formula_200 denotes the localization of a category that inverts every morphism, and formula_201 denotes the subcategory of all isomorphisms.

=== Relation to sSet ===

The nerve functor formula_202 embeds Grpd as a full subcategory of the category of simplicial sets. The nerve of a groupoid is always a Kan complex.

The nerve has a left adjoint
: formula_203
Here, formula_66 denotes the fundamental groupoid of the simplicial set .

=== Groupoids in Grpd ===

There is an additional structure which can be derived from groupoids internal to the category of groupoids, double-groupoids. Because Grpd is a 2-category, these objects form a 2-category instead of a 1-category since there is extra structure. Essentially, these are groupoids formula_205 with functorsformula_206and an embedding given by an identity functorformula_207One way to think about these 2-groupoids is they contain objects, morphisms, and squares which can compose together vertically and horizontally. For example, given squaresformula_208 and formula_209with formula_210 the same morphism, they can be vertically conjoined giving a diagramformula_211which can be converted into another square by composing the vertical arrows. There is a similar composition law for horizontal attachments of squares.

== Groupoids with geometric structures ==

When studying geometrical objects, the arising groupoids often carry a topology, turning them into topological groupoids, or even some differentiable structure, turning them into Lie groupoids. These last objects can be also studied in terms of their associated Lie algebroids, in analogy to the relation between Lie groups and Lie algebras.

Groupoids arising from geometry often possess further structures which interact with the groupoid multiplication. For instance, in Poisson geometry one has the notion of a symplectic groupoid, which is a Lie groupoid endowed with a compatible symplectic form. Similarly, one can have groupoids with a compatible Riemannian metric, or complex structure, etc.

<doc id="12544" wikidata="Q288824" url="?curid=12544" title="Galliard">
<text>The galliard (; ; ) was a form of Renaissance dance and music popular all over Europe in the 16th century. It is mentioned in dance manuals from England, Portugal, France, Spain, Germany, and Italy.

==Dance form==
The &quot;galliard&quot; is not an improvised dance, but rather, it consists of choreographed patterns of steps, which occupy one or more measures of music. In one measure, a galliard typically has five steps; in French such a basic step is called a &quot;cinq pas&quot; and in Italy, &quot;cinque passi&quot;. This is sometimes written in English sources as &quot;sinkapace&quot;. These steps are: right, left, right, left, cadence.

The galliard is an athletic dance, characterised by leaps, jumps, hops and other similar figures. The main feature that defines a galliard step is a large jump, after which the dancer lands with one leg ahead of the other. This jump is called a &quot;cadence,&quot; and the final landing is called the &quot;posture.&quot; The cadence is typically preceded by three quick hops with alternating feet. The sources generally describe movement patterns starting on the left foot, then repeating it starting with the right foot. A galliard pattern may also last twice as long, or more, which would involve 11 steps, or 17 steps.
The galliard was a favourite dance of Queen Elizabeth I of England, and although it is a relatively vigorous dance, in 1589 when the Queen was aged in her mid-fifties, John Stanhope of the Privy Chamber reported, &quot;the Queen is so well as I assure you, six or seven galliards in a morning, besides music and singing, is her ordinary exercise.&quot;

While most commonly being an entire dance, the galliard&#x27;s steps are used within many other forms of dance. For example, 16th-century Italian dances in Fabritio Caroso&#x27;s (1581) and Cesare Negri&#x27;s (1602) dance manuals often have a galliard section.

One special step used during a galliard is lavolta, a step which involves an intimate, close hold between a couple, with the woman being lifted into the air and the couple turning 270 degrees, within one six-beat measure. Lavolta was considered by some dancing masters as an inappropriate dance.

Another special step used during a galliard is the tassel kick (&quot;salto del fiocco&quot;). These steps are found in Negri&#x27;s manual and involve a galliard step usually (though not always) ending with a spin. The easier steps involve single spins of 180 or 360 degrees; later, more difficult steps involve multiple sequential spins and spins of up to at least 540 degrees. During the spin, the dancer kicks out to touch a tassel suspended between knee and waist height.

==Musical form==
Musical compositions in the galliard form appear to have been written and performed after the dance fell out of popular use. In musical compositions, the galliard often filled the role of an &quot;after dance&quot; written in 6, which followed and mimicked another piece (sometimes a pavane) written in 4. The distinctive 6 beats to the phrase can still be heard today in songs such as &quot;God Save the King&quot;.

<doc id="12545" wikidata="Q932510" url="?curid=12545" title="General surgery">
<text>Generalsurgery is a surgical specialty that focuses on alimentary canal and abdominal contents including the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, pancreas, gallbladder, appendix and bile ducts, and often the thyroid gland. General surgeons also deal with diseases involving the skin, breast, soft tissue, trauma, peripheral artery disease and hernias and perform endoscopic as such as gastroscopy, colonoscopy and laparoscopic procedures.

==Scope==

General surgeons may sub-specialise into one or more of the following disciplines:

===Trauma surgery===
In many parts of the world including North America, Australia and the United Kingdom, the overall responsibility for trauma care falls under the auspices of general surgery. Some general surgeons obtain advanced training in this field (most commonly surgical critical care) and specialty certification surgical critical care. General surgeons must be able to deal initially with almost any surgical emergency. Often, they are the first port of call to critically ill or gravely injured patients, and must perform a variety of procedures to stabilize such patients, such as thoracostomy, cricothyroidotomy, compartment fasciotomies and emergency laparotomy or thoracotomy to bleeding. They are also called upon to staff surgical intensive care units or trauma intensive care units.

All general surgeons are trained in emergency surgery. Bleeding, infections, bowel obstructions and organ perforations are the main problems they deal with. Cholecystectomy, the surgical removal of the gallbladder, is one of the most common surgical procedures done worldwide. This is most often done electively, but the gallbladder can become acutely inflamed and require an emergency operation. Infections and rupture of the appendix and small bowel obstructions are other common emergencies.

===Laparoscopic surgery===

This is a relatively new specialty dealing with minimal access techniques using cameras and small instruments inserted through 3- to 15-mm incisions. Robotic surgery is now evolving from this concept (see below). Gallbladders, appendices, and colons can all be removed with this technique. Hernias are also able to be repaired laparoscopically. Bariatric surgery can be performed laparoscopically and there a benefits of doing so to reduce wound complications in obese patients. General surgeons that are trained today are expected to be proficient in laparoscopic procedures.

===Colorectal surgery===

General surgeons treat a wide variety of major and minor colon and rectal diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn&#x27;s disease), diverticulitis, colon and rectal cancer, gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhoids.

=== Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery ===
General surgeons can specialise in Upper Gastro-intestinal (or foregut) surgery, which includes the surgical treatment of diseases of the stomach and oesophagus, liver, pancreas and gallbladder. In the UK, Upper GI surgeons can subspecialise further as benign surgeons, dealing with hiatus hernias and gallbladder diseases, bariatric surgeons, providing surgical care for weight management and metabolic diseases, or oesophago-gastric surgeons, dealing with complex problems related to the upper gastrointestinal tract (the foregut), including cancer. Surgical care of complex liver and pancreatic problems (including liver cancer and pancreatic cancer) is undertaken by Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery sub-specialists.

===Breast surgery===

General surgeons perform a majority of all non-cosmetic breast surgery from lumpectomy to mastectomy, especially pertaining to the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.

===Vascular surgery===

General surgeons can perform vascular surgery if they receive special training and certification in vascular surgery. Otherwise, these procedures are typically performed by vascular surgery specialists. However, general surgeons are capable of treating minor vascular disorders.

===Endocrine surgery===

General surgeons are trained to remove all or part of the thyroid and parathyroid glands in the neck and the adrenal glands just above each kidney in the abdomen. In many communities, they are the only surgeon trained to do this. In communities that have a number of subspecialists, other subspecialty surgeons may assume responsibility for these procedures.

===Transplant surgery===
Responsible for all aspects of pre-operative, operative, and post-operative care of abdominal organ transplant patients. Transplanted organs include liver, kidney, pancreas, and more rarely small bowel.

===Surgical oncology===
Surgical oncologist refers to a general surgical oncologist (a specialty of a general surgeon), but thoracic surgical oncologists, gynecologist and so forth can all be considered surgeons who specialize in treating cancer patients. The importance of training surgeons who sub-specialize in cancer surgery lies in evidence, supported by a number of clinical trials, that outcomes in surgical cancer care are positively associated to surgeon volume (i.e., the more cancer cases a surgeon treats, the more proficient he or she becomes, and his or her patients experience improved survival rates as a result). This is another controversial point, but it is generally accepted, even as common sense, that a surgeon who performs a given operation more often, will achieve superior results when compared with a surgeon who rarely performs the same procedure. This is particularly true of complex cancer resections such as pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer, and gastrectomy with extended (D2) lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer. Surgical oncology is generally a 2-year fellowship following completion of a general surgery residency (5–7 years).

===Cardiothoracic surgery===
Most cardiothoracic surgeons in the U.S. (D.O. or M.D.) first complete a general surgery residency (typically 5–7 years), followed by a cardiothoracic surgery fellowship (typically 2–3 years). However, new programmes are currently offering cardiothoracic surgery as a residency (6–8 years).

===Pediatric surgery=== 
Pediatric surgery is a subspecialty of general surgery. Pediatric surgeons do surgery on patients under age 18. Pediatric surgery is 5–7 years of residency and a 2-3 year fellowship.

==Trends==
In the 2000s, minimally invasive surgery became more prevalent. Considerable enthusiasm has been built around robot-assisted surgery (also known as &quot;robotic surgery&quot;), despite a lack of data suggesting it has significant benefits that justify its cost.

==Training==
In Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States general surgery is a five to seven year residency and follows completion of medical school, either MD, MBBS, MBChB, or DO degrees. In Australia and New Zealand, a residency leads to eligibility for Fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. In Canada, residency leads to eligibility for certification by and Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, while in the United States, completion of a residency in general surgery leads to eligibility for board certification by the American Board of Surgery or the American Osteopathic Board of Surgery which is also required upon completion of training for a general surgeon to have operating privileges at most hospitals in the United States.

In the United Kingdom, surgical trainees may apply to enter training after five years of medical school and two years of the Foundation Programme. During the two year core surgical training programme (&quot;phase 1&quot;), doctors are required to sit the Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) examination. On award of the MRCS by one of the four surgical colleges, surgeons may hold the title &#x27;Mister&#x27; or &#x27;Miss/Ms./Mrs&#x27; rather than doctor. This tradition dates back hundreds of years in the United Kingdom from when only physicians attended medical school and surgeons did not, but were rather associated with barbers in the Barber Surgeon&#x27;s Guild. The tradition is also present in many Commonwealth countries including New Zealand and some states of Australia. After completion of phase 1 training, trainees may apply for a nationally awarded Higher Surgical Training (HST) programme, which lasts six years and is now divided into two further phases (phases 2 and 3). Trainees are expected to declare a sub-specialty before the end of phase 2, and training during phase 3 focuses on that sub-specialty. Before the end of HST, the examination for Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS) must be taken in general surgery plus the subspeciality. Upon completion of training, the surgeon will be eligible for entry on the GMC Specialist Register. They may then apply to work both in the NHS and independent sector as a consultant surgeon, although many trainees complete further fellowships. The implementation of the European Working Time Directive limited UK surgical residents to an average 48-hour working week.

<text>Gorillas are herbivorous, predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees.

Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between , weights between , and arm spans up to , depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. The eastern gorilla is distinguished from the western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35–40 years in the wild. 

Gorillas&#x27; natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from . Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.

There are thought to be around 316,000 western gorillas in the wild, and 5,000 eastern gorillas. Both species are classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN; all subspecies are classified as Critically Endangered with the exception of the mountain gorilla, which is classified as Endangered. There are many threats to their survival, such as poaching, habitat destruction, and disease, which threaten the survival of the species. However, conservation efforts have been successful in some areas where they live.

== History and etymology ==

The word &quot;gorilla&quot; comes from the history of Hanno the Navigator ( 500 BC), a Carthaginian explorer on an expedition to the west African coast to the area that later became Sierra Leone. Members of the expedition encountered &quot;savage people, the greater part of whom were women, whose bodies were hairy, and whom our interpreters called Gorillae&quot;. It is unknown whether what the explorers encountered were what we now call gorillas, another species of ape or monkeys, or humans. Skins of gorillai women, brought back by Hanno, are reputed to have been kept at Carthage until Rome destroyed the city 350 years later at the end of the Punic Wars, 146 BC.

In 1625 Andrew Battel mentioned the existence of the animal, under the name Pongo:

A century and a half after Battel&#x27;s story was published, one writer called Radermacher wrote that &quot;the large species, described by Buffon and other authors as of the size of a man, is held by many to be a Chimera.&quot;

The American physician and missionary Thomas Staughton Savage and naturalist Jeffries Wyman first described the western gorilla in 1847 from specimens obtained in Liberia. They called it &quot;Troglodytes gorilla&quot;, using the then-current name of the chimpanzee genus. The species name was derived , as described by Hanno.

== Evolution and classification ==

The closest relatives of gorillas are the other two Homininae genera, chimpanzees and humans, all of them having diverged from a common ancestor about 7 million years ago. Human gene sequences differ only 1.6% on average from the sequences of corresponding gorilla genes, but there is further difference in how many copies each gene has. 

Until recently, gorillas were considered to be a single species, with three subspecies: the western lowland gorilla, the eastern lowland gorilla and the mountain gorilla. There is now agreement that there are two species, each with two subspecies. More recently, a third subspecies has been claimed to exist in one of the species. The separate species and subspecies developed from a single type of gorilla during the Ice Age, when their forest habitats shrank and became isolated from each other. Primatologists continue to explore the relationships between various gorilla populations. The species and subspecies listed here are the ones upon which most scientists agree.


The proposed third subspecies of &quot;Gorilla beringei&quot;, which has not yet received a trinomen, is the Bwindi population of the mountain gorilla, sometimes called the Bwindi gorilla.

Some variations that distinguish the classifications of gorilla include varying density, size, hair colour, length, culture, and facial widths. Population genetics of the lowland gorillas suggest that the western and eastern lowland populations diverged around 261 thousand years ago.

==Characteristics==
Wild male gorillas weigh , while adult females weigh . Adult males are tall, with an arm span that stretches from . Female gorillas are shorter at , with smaller arm spans. Colin Groves (1970) calculated the average weight of 42 wild adult male gorillas at 144 kg, while Smith and Jungers (1997) found the average weight of 19 wild adult male gorillas to be 169 kg. Adult male gorillas are known as silverbacks due to the characteristic silver hair on their backs reaching to the hips. The tallest gorilla recorded was a silverback with an arm span of , a chest of , and a weight of , shot in Alimbongo, northern Kivu in May 1938. The heaviest gorilla recorded was a silverback shot in Ambam, Cameroon, which weighed . Males in captivity can be overweight and reach weights up to .
The eastern gorilla is more darkly coloured than the western gorilla, with the mountain gorilla being the darkest of all. The mountain gorilla also has the thickest hair. The western lowland gorilla can be brown or greyish with a reddish forehead. In addition, gorillas that live in lowland forest are more slender and agile than the more bulky mountain gorillas. The eastern gorilla also has a longer face and broader chest than the western gorilla. Like humans, gorillas have individual fingerprints.
Their eye colour is dark brown, framed by a black ring around the iris. Gorilla facial structure is described as mandibular prognathism, that is, the mandible protrudes farther out than the maxilla. Adult males also have a prominent sagittal crest.

Gorillas move around by knuckle-walking, although they sometimes walk upright for short distances, typically while carrying food or in defensive situations. A 2018 study investigating the hand posture of 77 mountain gorillas at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (8% of the population) found that knuckle walking was done only 60% of the time, and they also supported their weight on their fists, the backs of their hands/feet, and on their palms/soles (with the digits flexed). Such a range of hand postures was previously thought to have been used by only orangutans. Studies of gorilla handedness have yielded varying results, with some arguing for no preference for either hand, and others right-hand dominance for the general population.

Studies have shown gorilla blood is not reactive to anti-A and anti-B monoclonal antibodies, which would, in humans, indicate type O blood. Due to novel sequences, though, it is different enough to not conform with the human ABO blood group system, into which the other great apes fit.

A gorilla&#x27;s lifespan is normally between 35 and 40 years, although zoo gorillas may live for 50 years or more in rare circumstances. At , Fatou is the oldest gorilla ever; oldest female gorilla ever; oldest living gorilla and oldest living female gorilla. The oldest male gorilla ever was Ozoum, who reached to the final age of 61 years, 24 days. The oldest living male gorilla is Guhonda, aged .

== Distribution and habitat ==

Gorillas have a patchy distribution. The range of the two species is separated by the Congo River and its tributaries. The western gorilla lives in west central Africa, while the eastern gorilla lives in east central Africa. Between the species, and even within the species, gorillas live in a variety of habitats and elevations. Gorilla habitat ranges from montane forest to swampland. Eastern gorillas inhabit montane and submontane forests between above sea level.

Mountain gorillas live in montane forests at the higher end of the elevation range, while eastern lowland gorillas live in submontane forests at the lower end. In addition, eastern lowland gorillas live in montane bamboo forests, as well as lowland forests ranging from in elevation. Western gorillas live in both lowland swamp forests and montane forests, at elevations ranging from sea level to . Western lowland gorillas live in swamp and lowland forests ranging up to , and Cross River gorillas live in low-lying and submontane forests ranging from .

==Ecology==
===Diet and foraging===

A gorilla&#x27;s day is divided between rest periods and travel or feeding periods. Diets differ between and within species. Mountain gorillas mostly eat foliage, such as leaves, stems, pith, and shoots, while fruit makes up a very small part of their diets. Mountain gorilla food is widely distributed and neither individuals nor groups have to compete with one another. Their home ranges vary from , and their movements range around or less on an average day. Despite eating a few species in each habitat, mountain gorillas have flexible diets and can live in a variety of habitats.
Eastern lowland gorillas have more diverse diets, which vary seasonally. Leaves and pith are commonly eaten, but fruits can make up as much as 25% of their diets. Since fruit is less available, lowland gorillas must travel farther each day, and their home ranges vary from , with day ranges . Eastern lowland gorillas will also eat insects, preferably ants. Western lowland gorillas depend on fruits more than the others and they are more dispersed across their range. They travel even farther than the other gorilla subspecies, at per day on average, and have larger home ranges of . Western lowland gorillas have less access to terrestrial herbs, although they can access aquatic herbs in some areas. Termites and ants are also eaten.

Gorillas rarely drink water &quot;because they consume succulent vegetation that is almost half water as well as morning dew&quot;, although both mountain and lowland gorillas have been observed drinking.

=== Nesting ===
Gorillas construct nests for daytime and night use. Nests tend to be simple aggregations of branches and leaves about in diameter and are constructed by individuals. Gorillas, unlike chimpanzees or orangutans, tend to sleep in nests on the ground. The young nest with their mothers, but construct nests after three years of age, initially close to those of their mothers. Gorilla nests are distributed arbitrarily and use of tree species for site and construction appears to be opportunistic. Nest-building by great apes is now considered to be not just animal architecture, but as an important instance of tool use.

Gorillas make a new nest to sleep on each day; even if remaining in the same place, they do not use the previous one. Usually, they are made an hour before dusk, to be ready to sleep when night falls. Gorillas sleep longer than humans, an average of 12 hours per day.

=== Interspecies interactions ===
One possible predator of gorillas is the leopard. Gorilla remains have been found in leopard scat, but this may be the result of scavenging. When the group is attacked by humans, leopards, or other gorillas, an individual silverback will protect the group, even at the cost of his own life. Gorillas do not appear to directly compete with chimpanzees in areas where they overlap. When fruit is abundant, gorilla and chimpanzee diets converge, but when fruit is scarce gorillas resort to vegetation. The two apes may also feed on different species, whether fruit or insects. Gorillas and chimpanzees may ignore or avoid each other when feeding on the same tree, but they have also been documented to form social bonds. Conversely, coalitions of chimpanzees have been observed attacking families of gorillas including silverbacks and killing infants.

== Behaviour ==

=== Social structure ===
Gorillas live in groups called troops. Troops tend to be made of one adult male or silverback, with a harem of multiple adult females and their offspring. However, multiple-male troops also exist. A silverback is typically more than 12 years of age, and is named for the distinctive patch of silver hair on his back, which comes with maturity. Silverbacks have large canine teeth that also come with maturity. Both males and females tend to emigrate from their natal groups. For mountain gorillas, females disperse from their natal troops more than males. Mountain gorillas and western lowland gorillas also commonly transfer to second new groups.

Mature males also tend to leave their groups and establish their own troops by attracting emigrating females. However, male mountain gorillas sometimes stay in their natal troops and become subordinate to the silverback. If the silverback dies, these males may be able to become dominant or mate with the females. This behaviour has not been observed in eastern lowland gorillas. In a single male group, when the silverback dies, the females and their offspring disperse and find a new troop. Without a silverback to protect them, the infants will likely fall victim to infanticide. Joining a new group is likely to be a tactic against this. However, while gorilla troops usually disband after the silverback dies, female eastern lowlands gorillas and their offspring have been recorded staying together until a new silverback transfers into the group. This likely serves as protection from leopards.

The silverback is the centre of the troop&#x27;s attention, making all the decisions, mediating conflicts, determining the movements of the group, leading the others to feeding sites, and taking responsibility for the safety and well-being of the troop. Younger males subordinate to the silverback, known as blackbacks, may serve as backup protection. Blackbacks are aged between 8 and 12 years and lack the silver back hair. The bond that a silverback has with his females forms the core of gorilla social life. Bonds between them are maintained by grooming and staying close together. Females form strong relationships with males to gain mating opportunities and protection from predators and infanticidal outside males. However, aggressive behaviours between males and females do occur, but rarely lead to serious injury. Relationships between females may vary. Maternally related females in a troop tend to be friendly towards each other and associate closely. Otherwise, females have few friendly encounters and commonly act aggressively towards each other.

Females may fight for social access to males and a male may intervene. Male gorillas have weak social bonds, particularly in multiple-male groups with apparent dominance hierarchies and strong competition for mates. Males in all-male groups, though, tend to have friendly interactions and socialise through play, grooming, and staying together, and occasionally they even engage in homosexual interactions. Severe aggression is rare in stable groups, but when two mountain gorilla groups meet the two silverbacks can sometimes engage in a fight to the death, using their canines to cause deep, gaping injuries.

=== Reproduction and parenting ===

Females mature at 10–12 years (earlier in captivity), and males at 11–13 years. A female&#x27;s first ovulatory cycle occurs when she is six years of age, and is followed by a two-year period of adolescent infertility. The estrous cycle lasts 30–33 days, with outward ovulation signs subtle compared to those of chimpanzees. The gestation period lasts 8.5 months. Female mountain gorillas first give birth at 10 years of age and have four-year interbirth intervals. Males can be fertile before reaching adulthood. Gorillas mate year round.

Females will purse their lips and slowly approach a male while making eye contact. This serves to urge the male to mount her. If the male does not respond, then she will try to attract his attention by reaching towards him or slapping the ground. In multiple-male groups, solicitation indicates female preference, but females can be forced to mate with multiple males. Males incite copulation by approaching a female and displaying at her or touching her and giving a &quot;train grunt&quot;. Recently, gorillas have been observed engaging in face-to-face sex, a trait once considered unique to humans and bonobos.

Gorilla infants are vulnerable and dependent, thus mothers, their primary caregivers, are important to their survival. Male gorillas are not active in caring for the young, but they do play a role in socialising them to other youngsters. The silverback has a largely supportive relationship with the infants in his troop and shields them from aggression within the group. Infants remain in contact with their mothers for the first five months and mothers stay near the silverback for protection. Infants suckle at least once per hour and sleep with their mothers in the same nest.

Infants begin to break contact with their mothers after five months, but only for a brief period each time. By 12 months old, infants move up to from their mothers. At around 18–21 months, the distance between mother and offspring increases and they regularly spend time away from each other. In addition, nursing decreases to once every two hours. Infants spend only half of their time with their mothers by 30 months. They enter their juvenile period at their third year, and this lasts until their sixth year. At this time, gorillas are weaned and they sleep in a separate nest from their mothers. After their offspring are weaned, females begin to ovulate and soon become pregnant again. The presence of play partners, including the silverback, minimizes conflicts in weaning between mother and offspring.

=== Communication ===

Twenty-five distinct vocalisations are recognised, many of which are used primarily for group communication within dense vegetation. Sounds classified as grunts and barks are heard most frequently while traveling, and indicate the whereabouts of individual group members. They may also be used during social interactions when discipline is required. Screams and roars signal alarm or warning, and are produced most often by silverbacks. Deep, rumbling belches suggest contentment and are heard frequently during feeding and resting periods. They are the most common form of intragroup communication.

For this reason, conflicts are most often resolved by displays and other threat behaviours that are intended to intimidate without becoming physical. As a result, fights do not occur very frequently. The ritualized charge display is unique to gorillas. The entire sequence has nine steps: (1) progressively quickening hooting, (2) symbolic feeding, (3) rising bipedally, (4) throwing vegetation, (5) chest-beating with cupped hands, (6) one leg kick, (7) sideways running, two-legged to four-legged, (8) slapping and tearing vegetation, and (9) thumping the ground with palms to end display.

A gorilla&#x27;s chest-beat may vary in frequency depending on its size. Smaller ones tend to have higher frequencies, while larger ones tend to be lower. They also do it the most when females are ready to mate.

==Intelligence==


Gorillas are considered highly intelligent. A few individuals in captivity, such as Koko, have been taught a subset of sign language. Like the other great apes, gorillas can laugh, grieve, have &quot;rich emotional lives&quot;, develop strong family bonds, make and use tools, and think about the past and future. Some researchers believe gorillas have spiritual feelings or religious sentiments. They have been shown to have cultures in different areas revolving around different methods of food preparation, and will show individual colour preferences.

===Tool use===

The following observations were made by a team led by Thomas Breuer of the Wildlife Conservation Society in September 2005. Gorillas are now known to use tools in the wild. A female gorilla in the Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park in the Republic of Congo was recorded using a stick as if to gauge the depth of water whilst crossing a swamp. A second female was seen using a tree stump as a bridge and also as a support whilst fishing in the swamp. This means all of the great apes are now known to use tools.

In September 2005, a two-and-a-half-year-old gorilla in the Republic of Congo was discovered using rocks to smash open palm nuts inside a game sanctuary. While this was the first such observation for a gorilla, over 40 years previously, chimpanzees had been seen using tools in the wild &#x27;fishing&#x27; for termites. Nonhuman great apes are endowed with semiprecision grips, and have been able to use both simple tools and even weapons, such as improvising a club from a convenient fallen branch.

==Scientific study==
American physician and missionary Thomas Staughton Savage obtained the first specimens (the skull and other bones) during his time in Liberia. The first scientific description of gorillas dates back to an article by Savage and the naturalist Jeffries Wyman in 1847 in &quot;Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History&quot;, where &quot;Troglodytes gorilla&quot; is described, now known as the western gorilla. Other species of gorilla were described in the next few years.

The explorer Paul Du Chaillu was the first westerner to see a live gorilla during his travel through western equatorial Africa from 1856 to 1859. He brought dead specimens to the UK in 1861.

The first systematic study was not conducted until the 1920s, when Carl Akeley of the American Museum of Natural History traveled to Africa to hunt for an animal to be shot and stuffed. On his first trip, he was accompanied by his friends Mary Bradley, a mystery writer, her husband, and their young daughter Alice, who would later write science fiction under the pseudonym James Tiptree Jr. After their trip, Mary Bradley wrote &quot;On the Gorilla Trail&quot;. She later became an advocate for the conservation of gorillas, and wrote several more books (mainly for children). In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Robert Yerkes and his wife Ava helped further the study of gorillas when they sent Harold Bigham to Africa. Yerkes also wrote a book in 1929 about the great apes.

After World War II, George Schaller was one of the first researchers to go into the field and study primates. In 1959, he conducted a systematic study of the mountain gorilla in the wild and published his work. Years later, at the behest of Louis Leakey and the &quot;National Geographic&quot;, Dian Fossey conducted a much longer and more comprehensive study of the mountain gorilla. When she published her work, many misconceptions and myths about gorillas were finally disproved, including the myth that gorillas are violent.

Western lowland gorillas (&quot;G. g. gorilla&quot;) are believed to be one of the zoonotic origins of HIV/AIDS. The SIVgor Simian immunodeficiency virus that infects them is similar to a certain strain of HIV-1.

=== Genome sequencing ===
The gorilla became the next-to-last great ape genus to have its genome sequenced. The first gorilla genome was generated with short read and Sanger sequencing using DNA from a female western lowland gorilla named Kamilah. This gave scientists further insight into the evolution and origin of humans. Despite the chimpanzees being the closest extant relatives of humans, 15% of the human genome was found to be more like that of the gorilla. In addition, 30% of the gorilla genome &quot;is closer to human or chimpanzee than the latter are to each other; this is rarer around coding genes, indicating pervasive selection throughout great ape evolution, and has functional consequences in gene expression.&quot; Analysis of the gorilla genome has cast doubt on the idea that the rapid evolution of hearing genes gave rise to language in humans, as it also occurred in gorillas.

==Captivity==

Gorillas became highly prized by western zoos since the 19th century, though the earliest attempts to keep them in captive facilities ended in their early death. In the late 1920s, the care of captive gorillas significantly improved. Colo (December 22, 1956 – January 17, 2017) of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium was the first gorilla to be born in captivity.

Captive gorillas exhibit stereotypic behaviors, including eating such as regurgitation, reingestion and self-injurious or conspecific aggression, pacing, rocking, sucking of fingers or lip smacking, and overgrooming. Negative vigilance of visitor behaviors have been identified as starting, posturing and charging at visitors. Groups of bachelor gorillas containing young silverbacks have significantly higher levels of aggression and wounding rates than mixed age and sex groups.

The use of both internal and external privacy screens on exhibit windows has been shown to alleviate stresses from visual effects of high crowd densities, leading to decreased stereotypic behaviors in the gorillas. Playing naturalistic auditory stimuli as opposed to classical music, rock music, or no auditory enrichment (which allows for crowd noise, machinery, etc. to be heard) has been noted to reduce stress behavior as well. Enrichment modifications to feed and foraging, where clover-hay is added to an exhibit floor, decrease stereotypic activities while simultaneously increasing positive food-related behaviors.

Recent research on captive gorilla welfare emphasizes a need to shift to individual assessments instead of a one-size-fits-all group approach to understanding how welfare increases or decreases based on a variety of factors. Individual characteristics such as age, sex, personality and individual histories are essential in understanding that stressors will affect each individual gorilla and their welfare differently.

== Conservation status ==

All species (and subspecies) of gorilla are listed as endangered or critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. All gorillas are listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), meaning that international export/import of the species, including in parts and derivatives, is regulated. Around 316,000 western lowland gorillas are thought to exist in the wild, 4,000 in zoos, thanks to conservation; eastern lowland gorillas have a population of under 5,000 in the wild and 24 in zoos. Mountain gorillas are the most severely endangered, with an estimated population of about 880 left in the wild and none in zoos. Threats to gorilla survival include habitat destruction and poaching for the bushmeat trade. Gorillas are closely related to humans, and are susceptible to diseases that humans also get infected by. In 2004, a population of several hundred gorillas in the Odzala National Park, Republic of Congo was essentially wiped out by the Ebola virus. A 2006 study published in &quot;Science&quot; concluded more than 5,000 gorillas may have died in recent outbreaks of the Ebola virus in central Africa. The researchers indicated in conjunction with commercial hunting of these apes, the virus creates &quot;a recipe for rapid ecological extinction&quot;. In captivity, it has also been observed that gorillas can also be infected with COVID-19.

Conservation efforts include the Great Apes Survival Project, a partnership between the United Nations Environment Programme and the UNESCO, and also an international treaty, the Agreement on the Conservation of Gorillas and Their Habitats, concluded under UNEP-administered Convention on Migratory Species. The Gorilla Agreement is the first legally binding instrument exclusively targeting gorilla conservation; it came into effect on 1 June 2008. Governments of countries where gorillas live placed a ban on their killing and trading, but weak law enforcement still poses a threat to them, since the governments rarely apprehend poachers, traders and consumers that rely on gorillas for profit.

== Cultural significance ==
In Cameroon&#x27;s Lebialem highlands, folk stories connect people and gorillas via totems; a gorilla&#x27;s death means the connected person will die also. This creates a local conservation ethic. Many different indigenous peoples interact with wild gorillas. Some have detailed knowledge; the Baka have words to distinguish at least ten types of gorilla individuals, by sex, age, and relationships. In 1861, alongside tales of hunting enormous gorillas, the traveller and anthropologist Paul Du Chaillu reported the Cameroonian story that a pregnant woman who sees a gorilla will give birth to one.

In 1911, the anthropologist Albert Jenks noted the Bulu people&#x27;s knowledge of gorilla behaviour and ecology, and their gorilla stories. In one such story, &quot;The Gorilla and the Child&quot;, a gorilla speaks to people, seeking help and trust, and stealing a baby; a man accidentally kills the baby while attacking the gorilla. Even far from where gorillas live, savannah tribes pursue &quot;cult-like worship&quot; of the apes. Some beliefs are widespread among indigenous peoples. The Fang name for gorilla is &quot;ngi&quot; while the Bulu name is &quot;njamong&quot;; the root &quot;ngi&quot; means fire, denoting a positive energy. From the Central African Republic to Cameroon and Gabon, stories of reincarnations as gorillas, totems, and transformations similar to those recorded by Du Chaillu are still told in the 21st century.

Since gaining international attention, gorillas have been a recurring element of many aspects of popular culture and media. They were usually portrayed as murderous and aggressive. Inspired by Emmanuel Frémiet&#x27;s &quot;Gorilla Carrying off a Woman&quot;, gorillas have been depicted kidnapping human women. This theme was used in films such as &quot;Ingagi&quot; (1930) and most notably &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933). The comedic play &quot;The Gorilla&quot;, which debuted in 1925, featured an escaped gorilla taking a woman from her house. Several films would use the &quot;escaped gorilla&quot; trope including &quot;The Strange Case of Doctor Rx&quot; (1942), &quot;The Gorilla Man&quot; (1943), &quot;Gorilla at Large&quot; (1954) and the Disney cartoons &quot;The Gorilla Mystery&quot; (1930) and &quot;Donald Duck and the Gorilla&quot; (1944).

Gorillas have been used as opponents to jungle-themed heroes such as Tarzan and Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, as well as superheroes. The DC Comics supervillain Gorilla Grodd is an enemy of the Flash. Gorillas also serve as antagonists in the 1968 film &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. More positive and sympathetic portrayals of gorillas include the films &quot;Son of Kong&quot; (1933), &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; (1949), &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot; (1988) and &quot;Instinct&quot; (1999) and the 1992 novel &quot;Ishmael&quot;. Gorillas have been featured in video games as well, notably &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;.

<text>GURPS Supers is a superhero roleplaying game written by Loyd Blankenship and published by Steve Jackson Games. The first edition was published in 1989.

==Contents==
&quot;GURPS Supers&quot; is a supplement of rules for comic-book superhero characters and campaigns for &quot;GURPS&quot;. The first edition book includes new combat rules, 24 superpowers, bionic superlimbs, gadgets and equipment, and rules for creating new powers, sample heroes and villains, and a briefly described campaign world. The second edition book is revised and corrected.

&quot;GURPS Supers&quot; deals with super-powered characters in a modern-day setting, and contains all the necessary rules to create superheroes for the &quot;GURPS&quot; basic system. The book also contains suggestions for running a superhero campaign, and a detailed background setting with the UN controlling most superheroes.

==Setting==
The official &quot;house setting&quot; for &quot;GURPS Supers&quot; is the &quot;IST World&quot;, described briefly in chapter 7 of &quot;GURPS Supers&quot; and later appearing in its own full-length supplement, &quot;GURPS International Super Teams&quot;.

==System==
&quot;GURPS Supers&quot; is a supplement for the GURPS roleplaying game and uses that basic rule system. The supplement offers additional rules and options for characters with superpowers.

Players can choose from several different basic types of superhero characters that influence how the character&#x27;s powers are selected. Players can select from a wide variety of powers and their modifications given in &quot;GURPS Supers&quot;, augmented by those in the &quot;GURPS Basic&quot;, plus any other GURPS book included by the campaign. The rules book included advice on creating superhero campaigns, and ways for the game master to customize the style of the campaign.

As part of the GURPS system, &quot;GURPS Supers&quot; allows the exchange of a player&#x27;s characters between any of the numerous other genres supported by GURPS. &quot;GURPS Supers&quot; favors lower-powered heroes over higher-powered ones. Many of the superpowers unique to &quot;GURPS Supers&quot; appear as Advantages and Disadvantages in the GURPS 4e Basic Set.

==History==
&quot;GURPS Supers&quot; was written by Loyd Blankenship, with a cover by Alan Gutierrez and Charlie Weidman, and was first published by Steve Jackson Games in 1988 as a 112-page book. &quot;GURPS Space&quot; was one of the broad genre books that was published after the &quot;GURPS Basic Set&quot;.

The 2nd edition of &quot;GURPS Supers&quot; was published in 1990 and featured a cover by John Zeleznik.

===Earlier editions and supplements===
The first edition of &quot;GURPS Supers&quot; was printed in 1989, and the second edition was published in 1990. The first edition had groupings of character powers that were not used in the second edition. Both were based on the Third Edition of &quot;GURPS Basic&quot;.

There were various aids, supplements and ready-made adventures available, including:
* &quot;GURPS Supers Adventures&quot;
* &quot;GURPS Supers: Death Wish&quot;
* &quot;GURPS Supers: Mixed Doubles&quot;
* &quot;GURPS Supers: School of Hard Knocks&quot;

===4th Edition===
&quot;GURPS Supers&quot; for 4e was published in 2007, one of several genre books published by Steve Jackson Games for the new edition.

For the 4th edition of GURPS, the majority of rules governing the creation of superhero characters are covered in the more generic &quot;GURPS Powers&quot;. A PDF release by William H. Stoddard covers the genre specific information in a similar style to &quot;GURPS Fantasy&quot; and &quot;GURPS Space&quot; books for the fourth edition of GURPS.

==Reception==
In the August 1989 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (Issue #8), James Wallis liked the design and layout of the book, but pointed out that &quot;the rewriting of a large number of rules [...] shows that &quot;GURPS&quot; is not a truly generic rolegame and makes &quot;GURPS Supers&quot; substantially harder to learn&quot;. He disliked the additional complexities around character generation, and was disturbed that the book did not spend much time on the creation of character background, saying this was a failure of the system to properly engage with the nature of comic books. He also commented that &quot;GURPS&quot; combat was frequently deadly, whereas in comic books combat is not usually lethal. Wallis concluded by giving this book a below average rating of only 2 out of 5: &quot;For my money, &quot;GURPS Supers&quot; is flawed [...] There is too much emphasis on rules changes; it fails as a superhero rolegame because of the overrealism of the &quot;GURPS&quot; rules, and it fails as a generic sourcebook because it is not generic&quot;. 

In the September 1996 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue #233), Rick Swan compared the second edition of &quot;GURPS Supers&quot; to &quot;Champions&quot;, and commented that &quot;&quot;GURPS Super&quot; takes a more realistic route, stressing personality over punch-outs. That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s stodgy; a typical chapter is titled &#x27;Unnatural Multiple Limbs from Another World&#x27;. The Second Edition streamlines the occasionally awkward mechanics of the First Edition and adds some nifty new powers&quot;. 

In the May 1996 edition of &quot;Arcane&quot; (issue #6), Steve Faragher gave the second edition of &quot;GURPS Supers&quot; a below-average rating of only 6 out of 10, and called the background setting &quot;rather dull&quot;, saying it is &quot;fine if you want to recreate a Saturday afternoon TV show, but not so great for a more fantastic, underground campaign of the &quot;Watchmen&quot; variety&quot;. Faragher concluded that &quot;it&#x27;s a competent enough set of rules - and one that&#x27;s well presented - but &quot;GURPS Supers&quot; is not exactly compulsive playing material&quot;.

<text>Gymnastics is a type of sport that includes physical exercises requiring balance, strength, flexibility, agility, coordination, artistry and endurance. The movements involved in gymnastics contribute to the development of the arms, legs, shoulders, back, chest, and abdominal muscle groups. Gymnastics evolved from exercises used by the ancient Greeks that included skills for mounting and dismounting a horse, and from circus performance skills.

The most common form of competitive gymnastics is artistic gymnastics (AG); for women, the events include floor, vault, uneven bars, and balance beam; for men, besides floor and vault, it includes rings, pommel horse, parallel bars, and horizontal bar.

The governing body for competition in gymnastics throughout the world is the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG). Eight sports are governed by the FIG, including gymnastics for all, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics, trampolining (including double mini-trampoline), tumbling, acrobatic, aerobic, and parkour. Disciplines not recognized by FIG include wheel gymnastics, aesthetic group gymnastics, TeamGym, and mallakhamba.

Participants in gymnastics-related sports include young children, recreational-level athletes, and competitive athletes at all skill levels.

==Etymology==
The word gymnastics derives from the common Greek adjective γυμνός (), by way of the related verb γυμνάζω (&quot;gymnazo&quot;), whose meaning is to &quot;train naked&quot;, &quot;train in gymnastic exercise&quot;, generally &quot;to train, to exercise&quot;. The verb had this meaning because athletes in ancient times exercised and competed without clothing.

==History==

Gymnastics can be traced to exercises performed in Ancient Greece, specifically in Sparta and Athens. Exercise of that time was documented by Philostratus&#x27; work &quot;Gymnastics: The Ethics of an Athletic Aesthetic&quot;. The original term for the practice of gymnastics is from the related Greek verb γυμνάζω (&quot;gumnázō&quot;), which translates as &quot;to train naked or nude,&quot; because young men exercised without clothing. In ancient Greece, physical fitness was highly valued among both men and women. It was not until after the Romans conquered Greece in 146 BC that gymnastics became more formalized and was used to train men in warfare. On Philostratus&#x27; claim that gymnastics is a form of wisdom, comparable to philosophy, poetry, music, geometry, and astronomy, the people of Athens combined this more physical training with the education of the mind. At the Palestra, a physical education training center, the disciplines of educating the body and the mind were combined, allowing for a form of gymnastics that was more aesthetic and individual and that left behind the focus on strictness, discipline, the emphasis on defeating records, and a focus on strength.
Don Francisco Amorós y Ondeano—a Spanish colonel born on 19 February 1770, in Valencia, who died on 8 August 1848, in Paris—was the first person to introduce educative gymnastics in France. The German Friedrich Ludwig Jahn began the German gymnastics movement in 1811 in Berlin, which led to the invention of the parallel bars, rings, the horizontal bar, the pommel horse and the vault horse.

Germans Charles Beck and Charles Follen and American John Neal brought the first wave of gymnastics to the United States in the 1820s. Beck opened the first gymnasium in the US in 1825 at the Round Hill School in Northampton, Massachusetts. Follen opened the first college gymnasium and the first public gymnasium in the US in 1826 at Harvard College and in Boston, Massachusetts, respectively. Neal was the first American to open a public gymnasium in the US, in Portland, Maine, in 1827. He also documented and promoted these early efforts in the &quot;American Journal of Education&quot; and &quot;The Yankee&quot;, helping to establish the American branch of the movement.
The Federation of International Gymnastics (FIG) was founded in Liege in 1881. By the end of the nineteenth century, men&#x27;s gymnastics competition was popular enough to be included in the first modern Olympic Games, in 1896. From then until the early 1950s, both national and international competitions involved a changing variety of exercises gathered under the rubric, &quot;gymnastics,&quot; which included, for example, synchronized team floor calisthenics, rope climbing, high jumping, running, and horizontal ladder. During the 1920s, women organized and participated in gymnastics events. Elin Falk revolutionized how gymnastics was taught in Swedish schools between 1910 and 1932. The first women&#x27;s Olympic competition was limited, involving only synchronized calisthenics and track and field. These games were held in 1928 in Amsterdam.

By 1954, Olympic Games apparatus and events for men and women had been standardized in a modern format, and uniform grading structures (including a point system from 1 to 15) had been agreed upon. In 1930, the first UK mass movement organization of women in gymnastics, the Women&#x27;s League of Health and Beauty, was founded by Mary Bagot Stack in London. At this time, Soviet gymnasts astounded the world with highly disciplined and difficult performances, setting a precedent that continues. Television has helped publicize and initiate a modern age of gymnastics. Both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s gymnastics now attract considerable international interest, and excellent gymnasts can be found on every continent.

In 2006, a new points system for Artistic gymnastics was put into play. An A Score (or D score) is the difficulty score, which as of 2009 derives from the eight highest-scoring elements in a routine (excluding Vault), in addition to the points awarded for composition requirements; each vault has a difficulty score assigned by the FIG. The B Score (or E Score), is the score for execution and is given for how well the skills are performed.

==FIG-recognized disciplines==

The following disciplines are governed by FIG.

===Artistic gymnastics===

Artistic gymnastics is usually divided into men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s gymnastics. Men compete on six events: floor exercise, pommel horse, still rings, vault, parallel bars, and horizontal bar, while women compete on four: vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise. In some countries, women at one time competed on the rings, horizontal bar, and parallel bars (for example, in the 1950s in the USSR).

In 2006, FIG introduced a new point system for artistic gymnastics. Unlike the old code of points, in which there was a maximum 10.0 score, there are two separate scores that are added to produce the final score. The first is the execution score, which starts at 10 and has deductions taken for execution mistakes, and the second is the difficulty score, which is open-ended and based on what elements the gymnasts perform. It may be lower than the intended difficulty score if the gymnast does not perform or complete all the skills, or they do not connect a skill meant to be connected to another. Scoring for national developmental levels or outside of the FIG competition system may continue to use the 10.0 system; for example, US women&#x27;s collegiate gymnastics still uses the 10.0 system.

====Competitive events for women in artistic gymnastics====
=====Vault=====

In the vaulting events, gymnasts sprint down a runway, to take off onto a vault board (or perform a roundoff or handspring entry onto a vault board). They then land momentarily inverted on the hands-on the vaulting horse or vaulting table (pre-flight segment) and propel themselves forward or backward off that platform to a two-footed landing (post-flight segment). The post-flight segment may include one or more saltos, or twisting movements. A round-off entry vault, called a Yurchenko, is a commonly performed vault in the higher levels of women&#x27;s gymnastics. Other vaults include taking off from the vault board with both feet at the same time and either doing a front handspring or round-off onto the vaulting table.

In 2001, the traditional vaulting horse was replaced with a new apparatus, sometimes known as a tongue, horse, or vaulting table. The new apparatus is more stable, wider, and longer than the older vaulting horse, approximately in length and in width, giving gymnasts a larger blocking surface. This apparatus is thus considered safer than the vaulting horse used in the past. With the addition of this new, safer vaulting table, gymnasts are attempting more difficult vaults.

=====Uneven bars=====

On the uneven bars, gymnasts perform a timed routine on two parallel horizontal bars set at different heights. These bars are made of fiberglass covered in wood laminate to prevent them from breaking. In the past, bars were made of wood, but the bars were prone to breaking, providing an incentive to switch to newer technologies. The height of the bars may be adjusted by to the size needed by individual gymnasts, although the distance between bars cannot be changed for individual gymnasts in elite competition. 

In the past, the uneven parallel bars were closer together. The bars have been moved increasingly further apart, allowing gymnasts to perform swinging, circling, transitional, and release moves that may pass over, under, and between the two bars. At the elite level, movements must pass through the handstand. Gymnasts often mount the uneven bars using a springboard or a small mat, and they may use chalk (MgCO3) and grips (a leather strip with holes for fingers to protect hands and improve performance) when performing this event. The chalk helps take the moisture out of gymnasts&#x27; hands to decrease friction and prevent rips (tears to the skin of the hands); dowel grips help gymnasts grip the bar.

=====Balance beam=====
The gymnast performs a choreographed routine of up to 90 seconds in length consisting of leaps, acrobatic skills, somersaults, turns, and dance elements on a padded beam. The beam is above the ground, long, and wide. It can also be adjusted, to be raised higher or lower.

=====Floor=====
The event in gymnastics performed on the floor is called floor exercise. In the past, the floor exercise event was executed on the bare floor or mats such as wrestling mats. The floor event now occurs on a carpeted x square, usually consisting of hard foam over a layer of plywood, which is supported by springs generally called a spring floor. This provides a firm surface that provides extra bounce or spring when compressed, allowing gymnasts to achieve greater height and a softer landing after the composed skill. Gymnasts perform a choreographed routine to music (without words) for up to 90 seconds. The routine should consist of tumbling passes, series of jumps, leaps, dance elements, acrobatic skills, and turns, or pivots, on one foot. A gymnast can perform up to four tumbling passes, each of which usually includes at least one flight element without hand support.

====Competitive events for men in artistic gymnastics====
=====Floor=====

Male gymnasts also perform on a x spring floor. A series of tumbling passes are performed to demonstrate flexibility, strength, and balance. Strength skills include circles, scales, and press handstands. Men&#x27;s floor routines usually have multiple passes that have to total between 60 and 70 seconds and are performed without music, unlike the women&#x27;s event. Rules require that male gymnasts touch each corner of the floor at least once during their routine.

=====Pommel horse=====

The pommel horse consists of a horizontal body with two pommels, or handles. Gymnasts perform by using their hands to support themselves on the horse. A typical pommel horse exercise involves both single-leg and double-leg work. Single-leg skills are generally found in the form of scissors, an element often done on the pommels. Double leg work, however, is the main staple of this event. The gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise depending on preference) and performs such skills on all parts of the apparatus. To make the exercise more challenging, gymnasts often include variations on a typical circling skill by turning (moores and spindles) or by straddling their legs (flares). Routines end when the gymnast performs a dismount, either by swinging his body over the horse or landing after a handstand variation.

=====Still rings=====
The rings are suspended on wire cable from a point from the floor. The gymnast grips the rings and must perform a routine demonstrating balance, strength, power, and dynamic motion while preventing the rings themselves from swinging. At least one static strength move is required, but some gymnasts may include two or three. A routine ends with a dismount.

=====Vault=====

Gymnasts sprint down a runway, which is a maximum of runway in length, before hurdling onto a springboard. They then land momentarily inverted on the hands-on the vaulting horse or vaulting table (pre-flight segment) and propel themselves forward or backward off that platform to a two-footed landing (post-flight segment). In advanced gymnastics, multiple twists and somersaults may be added in the post-flight segment before landing. Successful vaults depend on the speed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle, the kinesthetic awareness in the air, how well they stuck the landing, and the speed of rotation in the case of more difficult and complex vaults.

=====Parallel bars=====

Men perform on two bars set in parallel by executing a series of swings, balances, and releases that require great strength and coordination. The width between the bars is adjustable depending upon the actual needs of the gymnasts, and the bars are usually high.

=====Horizontal bar=====

A thick steel bar raised is raised the landing area. The gymnast holds on to the bar and performs giant swings or &quot;giants&quot; (forward or backward revolutions around the bar in the handstand position), release skills, twists, and changes of direction. By using the momentum from giants and then releasing at the proper point, enough height can be achieved for spectacular dismounts, such as a triple-back salto. Leather grips are usually used to help maintain a grip on the bar, and to prevent rips. While training for this event, straps are often used to ensure that the gymnasts do not fall off the bar as they are learning new skills.

===Rhythmic gymnastics===
According to FIG rules, only women compete in rhythmic gymnastics. This is a sport that combines elements of ballet, gymnastics, dance, and apparatus manipulation, with a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather than the acrobatic. Gymnasts compete either as individuals or in groups. Individuals perform four separate routines, each using one of the four apparatuses—ball, ribbon, hoop, clubs, and formerly, rope—on a floor area. Groups consist of five gymnasts who perform two routines together, one with five of the same apparatus and one with three of one apparatus and two of another; the FIG defines which apparatuses groups use each year.

Routines are given three sub-scores: difficulty, execution, and artistry. Difficulty is open-ended and based on the value given to the elements performed in the routine, and execution and artistry start at ten points and are lowered for specific mistakes made by the gymnasts. The three sub-scores are added together for the final score for each routine.

International competitions are split between Juniors, under sixteen by their year of birth, and Seniors, for women sixteen and over. Gymnasts in Russia and Europe typically start training at a very young age and those at their peak are typically in their late teens (15–19) or early twenties. The largest events in the sport are the Olympic Games, World Championships, European Championships, World Cup and Grand Prix series. The first World Championships were held in 1963, and rhythmic gymnastics made its first appearance at the Olympics in 1984.

====Rhythmic gymnastics apparatus====

; Ball:The ball may be made of rubber or a similar synthetic material, and it can be of any color. It should rest in the gymnast&#x27;s hand and not be pressed against the wrist or grasped with the fingers, which incurs a penalty. Fundamental elements of a ball routine include bouncing or rolling the ball.
; Hoop: The hoop comes up to about the gymnast&#x27;s hip. It may be made of plastic or wood, and it may be covered with adhesive tape either of the same or different color as the hoop, which may be in decorative patterns. Fundamental requirements of a hoop routine include rotation of the hoop around the hand or body, rolling the hoop on the body or floor, and the gymnast passing through the hoop.
; Ribbon: The ribbon consists of a handle, which may be made of wood, bamboo, or synthetic materials such as fiberglass, and the ribbon itself, which is made of satin. The ribbon is six meters long, and due to its length, it can easily become tangled or knotted; knots must be undone or the gymnast will be penalized. Fundamental elements of a ribbon routine consist of making continuous shapes with the length of the fabric, such as tight circles (spirals) or waves (snakes), and elements called boomerangs, in which the gymnast tosses the handle, then pulls it back by the end of the ribbon and catches it.
; Clubs: The clubs may be made of wood or synthetic materials, and they are always used in a pair. They may be connected together by inserting the end of one club into the head of the other. The handles and bodies are typically wrapped with decorative tapes. Fundamental elements of a clubs routine including swinging the heads of the clubs in circles, small throws in which the clubs rotate in the air, and asymmetrical movements.
; Rope: The rope is made from hemp or a similar synthetic material; it can be knotted and have anti-slip material at the ends, but it does not have handles. The fundamental requirements of a rope routine include leaping and skipping. In 2011, the FIG decided to eliminate the use of rope in senior individual rhythmic gymnastics competitions. It is still sometimes seen in junior group competition.

====Men&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics====
There are two versions of rhythmic gymnastics for men, neither of which is currently recognized by the FIG. One was developed in Japan in the 1940s and was originally practiced by both boys and girls for fitness, with women still occasionally participating on the club level today. Gymnasts either perform in groups with no apparatus, or individually with apparatus (stick, clubs, rope, or double rings). Unlike women&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics, it is performed on a sprung floor, and the gymnasts perform acrobatic moves and flips. The other version was developed in Europe and uses generally the same rules as the women and the same set of apparatus. It is most prominent in Spain, which has held national men&#x27;s competitions since 2009 and mixed-gender group competitions since 2021, and France.

===Trampolining===

====Trampolining====
Trampolining and tumbling consists of four events, individual and synchronized trampoline, double mini trampoline, and tumbling (also known as power tumbling or rod floor). Since 2000, individual trampoline has been included in the Olympic Games. The first World Championships were held in 1964.

=====Individual trampoline=====
Individual routines in trampolining involve a build-up phase, during which the gymnast jumps repeatedly to achieve height, followed by a sequence of ten bounces without pause during which the gymnast performs a sequence of aerial skills. Routines are marked out of a maximum score of 10 points. Additional points (with no maximum at the highest levels of competition) can be earned depending on the difficulty of the moves and the length of time taken to complete the ten skills which is an indication of the average height of the jumps. In high level competitions, there are two preliminary routines, one which has only two moves scored for difficulty and one where the athlete is free to perform any routine. This is followed by a final routine, which is again optional (that is, the gymnast is allowed to perform whichever skills they choose). Some competitions restart the score from zero for the finals, while others add the final score to the preliminary results.

=====Synchronized trampoline=====
Synchronized trampoline is similar except that both competitors must perform the routine together and marks are awarded for synchronization as well as the form and difficulty of the moves.

=====Double-mini trampoline=====

Double mini trampoline involves a smaller trampoline with a run-up; two scoring moves are performed per routine. Moves cannot be repeated in the same order on the double-mini during a competition. Skills can be repeated if a skill is competed as a mounter in one routine and a dismount in another. The scores are marked in a similar manner to individual trampoline.

===Tumbling===
In tumbling, athletes perform an explosive series of flips and twists down a sprung tumbling track. Scoring is similar to trampolining. Tumbling was originally contested as one of the events in Men&#x27;s Artistic Gymnastics at the 1932 Summer Olympics, and in 1955 and 1959 at the Pan American Games. From 1974 to 1998 it was included as an event for both genders at the Acrobatic Gymnastics World Championships. The event has also been contested since 1976 at the Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships.

Tumbling is competed along a 25-metre sprung tack with a 10-metre run up. A tumbling pass or run is a combination of 8 skills, with an entry skill, normally a round-off, to whips (similar to a handspring without hand support) and into an end skill. Usually the end skill is the hardest skill of the pass. At the highest level, gymnasts perform transitional skills. These are skills which are not whips, but are double or triple somersaults (usually competed at the end of the run), but now competed in the middle of the run connected before and after by either a whip or a flick.

Competition is made up of a qualifying round and a finals round. There are two different types of competition in tumbling, individual and team. In the team event three gymnasts out of a team of four compete one run each, if one run fails the final member of the team is allowed to compete with the three highest scores being counted. In the individual event qualification, the competitor will compete two runs, one a straight pass (including double and triple somersaults) and a twisting pass (including full twisting whips and combination skills such as a full twisting double straight &#x27;full in back&#x27;). In the final of the individual event, the competitor must compete two different runs which can be either twisting or straight but each run normally uses both types (using transition skills).

===Acrobatic gymnastics===
Acrobatic gymnastics (formerly sport acrobatics), often referred to as acro, acrobatic sports or simply sports acro, is a group gymnastic discipline for both men and women. Acrobats perform to music in groups of two, three and four.

There are four international age categories: 11–16, 12–18, 13–19, and Senior (15+), which are used in the World Championships and many other events around the world, including the European Championships and the World Games.

All levels require a balance routine, which focuses on held balance skills, and a dynamic routine, which focuses on flipping elements; 12–18, 13–19, and Seniors are also required to perform a final (combined) routine.

Currently, acrobatic gymnastics scores are marked out of 30.00 for juniors, and they can be higher at the Senior FIG level based on difficulty:
* Difficulty – An open score, which is the sum of the difficulty values of elements (valued from the tables of difficulties) successfully performed in an exercise, divided by 100. This score is unlimited in senior competitions. 
* Execution – Judges give a score out of 10.00 for technical performance (how well the skills are executed), which is then doubled to emphasize its importance.
* Artistic – Judges give a score out of 10.00 for artistry (the overall performance of the routine, namely choreography).

There are five competitive event categories:
* Women&#x27;s Pairs
* Mixed Pairs
* Men&#x27;s Pairs
* Women&#x27;s Groups (3 women)
* Men&#x27;s Groups (4 men)

The World Championships have been held since 1974.

===Aerobic gymnastics===
Aerobic gymnastics (formally sport aerobics) involves the performance of routines by individuals, pairs, trios, groups with 5 people, and aerobic dance and aerobic step (8 people). Strength, flexibility, and aerobic fitness rather than acrobatic or balance skills are emphasized. Seniors perform routines on a x floor, with a smaller x floor used for younger participants. Routines last 70–90 seconds depending on the age of the participants and the routine category. The World Championships have been held since 1995.

The events consist of:
*Individual Women
*Individual Men
*Mixed Pairs
*Trios
*Groups
*Dance
*Step

===Parkour===

On 28 January 2018, parkour, also known as freerunning, was given the go-ahead to begin development as a FIG sport. The FIG was planning to run World Cup competitions from 2018 onwards. The first Parkour World Championships were planned for 2020, but were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and instead took place from 15 to 16 October 2022 in Tokyo, Japan.

The events consist of:
*Speedrun
*Freestyle

=== Para-gymnastics ===

Para-gymnastics, gymnastics for disabled athletes with para-athletics classifications, was recognized as a new FIG discipline in October 2024. As an FIG discipline, it currently only covers artistic gymnastics.

==Other disciplines==
The following disciplines are not currently recognized by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique.

===Aesthetic group gymnastics===
Aesthetic Group Gymnastics (AGG) was developed from the Finnish &quot;naisvoimistelu&quot;. It differs from rhythmic gymnastics in that body movement is large and continuous and teams are larger, and athletes do not use apparatus in international AGG competitions. The sport requires physical qualities such as flexibility, balance, speed, strength, coordination and sense of rhythm where movements of the body are emphasized through the flow, expression and aesthetic appeal. A good performance is characterized by uniformity and simultaneity. The competition program consists of versatile and varied body movements, such as body waves, swings, balances, pivots, jumps and leaps, dance steps, and lifts. The International Federation of Aesthetic Group Gymnastics (IFAGG) was established in 2003. The first Aesthetic Group Gymnastics World Championships was held in 2000.

===TeamGym===
TeamGym is a form of competition created by the European Union of Gymnastics, originally named EuroTeam. The first official competition was held in Finland in 1996. TeamGym events consist of three sections: women, men and mixed teams. Athletes compete in three different disciplines: floor, tumbling and trampette. Teams require effective teamwork and tumbling technique. There is no World Championships; however, there has been a European Championships held since 2010.

===Wheel gymnastics===
Wheel gymnasts do exercises in a large wheel known as the Rhönrad, gymnastics wheel, gym wheel, or German wheel. It has also been known as the ayro wheel, aero wheel, and Rhon rod.

There are four core categories of exercise: straight line, spiral, vault and cyr wheel. The first World Championships was held in 1995.

===Mallakhamba===
Mallakhamba (Marathi: मल्लखम्ब) is a traditional Indian sport in which a gymnast performs feats and poses in concert with a vertical wooden pole or rope. The word also refers to the pole used in the sport.

Mallakhamba derives from the terms &quot;malla&quot; which denotes a wrestler and &quot;khamba&quot; which means a pole. Mallakhamba can therefore be translated to English as &quot;pole gymnastics&quot;. On 9 April 2013, the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh declared mallakhamba as the state sport. In February 2019 the first Mallahkhamb World Championship was held in Mumbai

==Non-competitive gymnastics==
General gymnastics, also known as &quot;gymnastics for all&quot;, enables people of all ages and abilities to participate in performance groups of 6 to more than 150 athletes. They can perform synchronized, choreographed routines. Troupes may consist of both genders and are separated into age divisions. The largest general gymnastics exhibition is the quadrennial World Gymnaestrada, which was first held in 1939. In 1984 gymnastics for all was officially recognized first as a sport program by the FIG (International Gymnastic Federation), and subsequently by national gymnastic federations worldwide with participants that now number 30 million. Non-competitive gymnastics is considered useful for its health benefits.

==Scoring (code of points)==
An artistic gymnast&#x27;s score comes from deductions taken from the start value of a routine&#x27;s elements. The start value of a routine is based on the difficulty of the elements the gymnast attempts and whether or not the gymnast meets composition requirements. The composition requirements are different for each apparatus. This score is called the D score. Deductions in execution and artistry are taken from a maximum of 10.0. This score is called the E score. The final score is calculated by adding the D and E score.

The current method of scoring, by adding D and E score to give the final score has been in place since 2006. The current method is called &quot;open-end&quot; scoring because there is no theoretical cap (although there is practical cap) to the D-score and hence the total possible score for a routine. Before 2006, a gymnast&#x27;s final score is deducted from a possible maximum of 10 for a routine.

A Code of Points or guidelines of scoring a routine&#x27;s difficulty and execution is slightly revised for each quadrennium, or period of four years culminating in the Olympics year.

==Former apparatus and events==

===Rope climbing===
Generally, competitors climbed either a or an long, diameter natural fiber rope for speed, starting from a seated position on the floor and using only the hands and arms. Kicking the legs was normally permitted. Many gymnasts can do this in the straddle or pike position, which eliminates the help generated from the legs, though it can be done with legs as well.

===Flying rings===
Flying rings was an event similar to still rings, but with the performer executing a series of stunts while swinging. It was a gymnastic event sanctioned by both the NCAA and the AAU until the early 1960s.

===Club swinging===
Club swinging, a.k.a. Indian clubs, was an event in men&#x27;s artistic gymnastics sometime up until the 1950s. It was similar to the clubs in both women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics, but much simpler, with few throws allowed. It was included in the 1904 and 1932 Summer Olympic Games.

===Other (men&#x27;s artistic)===
*Team horizontal bar and parallel bar in the 1896 Summer Olympics
*Team free and Swedish system in the 1912 and 1920 Summer Olympics
*Combined and triathlon in the 1904 Summer Olympics
*Side horse vault in 1924 Summer Olympics
*Tumbling in the 1932 Summer Olympics

===Other (women&#x27;s artistic)===
*Team exercise at the 1928, 1936, and 1948 Summer Olympics
*Parallel bars at the 1938 World Championships
*Team portable apparatus at the 1952 and 1956 Summer Olympics

==Health and safety==

Gymnastics is one of the most dangerous sports, with a very high injury rate seen in girls age 11 to 18. 

Some gymnastic movements which were allowed in past competitions are now banned for safety reasons; for example, the Thomas salto, a twisting salto landed with a forward roll on the floor, was banned after several injuries. Elena Mukhina, the 1978 World all-around champion, broke her neck while practicing the skill in an exhausted state and became quadriplegic. The vaulting table replaced the old vaulting horse in the early 2000s and an additional mat was added around the springboard for safety reasons after several female gymnasts, such as Julissa Gomez, became paralyzed during vaulting attempts.

=== Landing ===
In a tumbling pass, dismount, or vault, landing is the final phase, following take-off and flight This is a critical skill in terms of execution in competition scores, general performance, and injury occurrence. Without the necessary magnitude of energy dissipation during impact, the risk of sustaining injuries during somersaulting increases. These injuries commonly occur at the lower extremities such as cartilage lesions, ligament tears, and bone bruises/fractures. To avoid such injuries, and to receive a high-performance score, proper technique must be used by the gymnast. &quot;The subsequent ground contact or impact landing phase must be achieved using a safe, aesthetic, and well-executed double foot landing.&quot; A successful landing in gymnastics is classified as soft, meaning the knee and hip joints are at greater than 63 degrees of flexion.

A higher flight phase results in a higher vertical ground reaction force. Vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) represents an external force which the gymnasts have to overcome with their muscle force and affects the gymnasts&#x27; linear and angular momentum. Another important variable that affects linear and angular momentum is the time the landing takes. Gymnasts can decrease the impact force by increasing the time taken to perform the landing. Gymnasts can achieve this by increasing hip, knee and ankle amplitude.

===Podium training===
Podium training refers to the official practice session before a gymnastics competition begins. The purpose of this is to enable competing gymnasts to get a feel for the competition equipment inside the arena in which they will be competing, primarily for reasons of safety.

===Physical injuries===
Compared to athletes who play other sports, gymnasts are at higher than average risk of overuse injuries and injuries caused by early sports specialization among children and young adults. Gymnasts are at particular risk of foot and wrist injuries. Strength training can help prevent injuries.

===Abuse===
There have been recorded cases of emotional and sexual abuse in gymnastics in many different countries. The USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal is considered one of the largest abuse scandals in sports history. In 2022, the Whyte Review was published, criticizing extensive abusive practices by British Gymnastics that included sexual and emotional abuse and excessive weight management of athletes.

===Height concerns===
Gymnasts tend to have short stature, but it is unlikely that the sport affects their growth. Parents of gymnasts tend also to be shorter than average.

<doc id="12552" wikidata="Q189193" url="?curid=12552" title="Great auk">
<text>The great auk (Pinguinus impennis), also known as the penguin or garefowl, is an extinct species of flightless alcid that first appeared around 400,000 years ago and became extinct in the mid-19th century. It was the only modern species in the genus Pinguinus. It was unrelated to the penguins of the Southern Hemisphere, which were named for their resemblance to this species.

It bred on rocky, remote islands with easy access to the ocean and a plentiful food supply, a rarity in nature that provided only a few breeding sites for the great auks. During the non-breeding season, the auk foraged in the waters of the North Atlantic, ranging as far south as northern Spain and along the coastlines of Canada, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway, Ireland, and Great Britain.

The bird was tall and weighed about , making it the largest alcid to survive into the modern era, and the second-largest member of the alcid family overall (the prehistoric &quot;Miomancalla&quot; was larger). It had a black back and a white belly. The black beak was heavy and hooked, with grooves on its surface. During summer, great auk plumage showed a white patch over each eye. During winter, the great auk lost these patches, instead developing a white band stretching between the eyes. The wings were only long, rendering the bird flightless. Instead, the great auk was a powerful swimmer, a trait that it used in hunting. Its favourite prey were fish, including Atlantic menhaden and capelin, and crustaceans. Although agile in the water, it was clumsy on land. Great auk pairs mated for life. They nested in extremely dense and social colonies, laying one egg on bare rock. The egg was white with variable brown marbling. Both parents participated in the incubation of the egg for around six weeks before the young hatched. The young left the nest site after two to three weeks, although the parents continued to care for it.

The great auk was an important part of many Native American cultures, both as a food source and as a symbolic item. Many Maritime Archaic people were buried with great auk bones. One burial discovered included someone covered by more than 200 great auk beaks, which are presumed to be the remnants of a cloak made of great auks&#x27; skins. Early European explorers to the Americas used the great auk as a convenient food source or as fishing bait, reducing its numbers. The bird&#x27;s down was in high demand in Europe, a factor that largely eliminated the European populations by the mid-16th century. Around the same time, nations such as Great Britain began to realize that the great auk was disappearing and it became the beneficiary of many early environmental laws, but despite that the great auk were still hunted.

Its growing rarity increased interest from European museums and private collectors in obtaining skins and eggs of the bird. On 3 June 1844, the last two confirmed specimens were killed on Eldey, off the coast of Iceland, ending the last known breeding attempt. Later reports of roaming individuals being seen or caught are unconfirmed. A report of one great auk in 1852 is considered by some to be the last sighting of a member of the species. The great auk is mentioned in several novels, and the scientific journal of the American Ornithological Society was named &quot;The Auk&quot; (now &quot;Ornithology&quot;) in honour of the bird until 2021.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

Analysis of mtDNA sequences has confirmed morphological and biogeographical studies suggesting that the razorbill is the closest living relative of the great auk. The great auk also was related closely to the little auk or dovekie, which underwent a radically different evolution compared to &quot;Pinguinus&quot;. Due to its outward similarity to the razorbill (apart from flightlessness and size), the great auk often was placed in the genus &quot;Alca&quot;, following Linnaeus.

The oldest known fossil records of the modern great auk are from the Boxgrove Palaeolithic site of England and Lower Town Hill Formation of Bermuda, both of which are dated to the Middle Pleistocene at least 400,000 years BP. The Pliocene sister species, &quot;Pinguinus alfrednewtoni&quot;, and molecular evidence show that the three closely related genera diverged soon after their common ancestor, a bird probably similar to a stout Xantus&#x27;s murrelet, had spread to the coasts of the Atlantic. Apparently, by that time, the murres, or Atlantic guillemots, already had split from the other Atlantic alcids. Razorbill-like birds were common in the Atlantic during the Pliocene, but the evolution of the little auk is sparsely documented. The molecular data are compatible with either possibility, but the weight of evidence suggests placing the great auk in a distinct genus. Some ornithologists still believe it is more appropriate to retain the species in the genus &quot;Alca&quot;. It is the only recorded British bird made extinct in historic times.

The following cladogram shows the placement of the great auk among its closest relatives, based on a 2004 genetic study:

&quot;Pinguinus alfrednewtoni&quot; was a larger, and also flightless, member of the genus &quot;Pinguinus&quot; that lived during the Early Pliocene. Known from bones found in the Yorktown Formation of the Lee Creek Mine in North Carolina, it is believed to have split, along with the great auk, from a common ancestor. &quot;Pinguinus alfrednewtoni&quot; lived in the western Atlantic, while the great auk lived in the eastern Atlantic. After the former died out following the Pliocene, the great auk took over its territory. The great auk was not related closely to the other extinct genera of flightless alcids, &quot;Mancalla&quot;, &quot;Praemancalla&quot;, and &quot;Alcodes&quot;.

===Etymology===

The great auk was one of the 4,400 animal species formally described by Carl Linnaeus in his eighteenth-century work &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, in which it was given the binomial &quot;Alca impennis&quot;. The name &quot;Alca&quot; is a Latin derivative of the Scandinavian word for razorbills and their relatives. The bird was known in literature even before this and was described by Charles d&#x27;Ecluse in 1605 as &quot;Mergus Americanus.&quot; This also included a woodcut which represents the oldest unambiguous visual depictions of the bird.

The species was not placed in its own scientific genus, &quot;Pinguinus&quot;, until 1791. The generic name is derived from the Spanish, Portuguese and French name for the species, in turn from Latin meaning &quot;plump&quot;, and the specific name, &quot;impennis&quot;, is from Latin and refers to the lack of flight feathers, or &quot;pennae&quot;.

The Irish name for the great auk is , meaning &quot;big seabird/auk&quot;. The Basque name is &#x27;, meaning &quot;spearbill&quot;. Its early French name was &quot;apponatz&quot;, while modern French uses &#x27;. The Norse called the great auk &quot;geirfugl&quot;, which means &quot;spearbird&quot;. This has led to an alternative English common name for the bird, &quot;garefowl&quot; or &quot;gairfowl&quot;. The Inuit name for the great auk was &quot;isarukitsok&quot;, which meant &quot;little wing&quot;.

The word &quot;penguin&quot; first appears in the sixteenth century as a synonym for &quot;great auk&quot;. Although the etymology is debated, the generic name &quot;penguin&quot; may be derived from the Welsh &quot;pen gwyn&quot; &quot;white head&quot;, either because the birds lived in New Brunswick on White Head Island (Pen Gwyn in Welsh) or because the great auk had such large white circles on its head. When European explorers discovered what today are known as penguins in the Southern Hemisphere, they noticed their similar appearance to the great auk and named them after this bird, although biologically, they are not closely related. Whalers also lumped the northern and southern birds together under the common name &quot;woggins&quot;.

==Description==

Standing about tall and weighing approximately as adult birds, the flightless great auk was the second-largest member of both its family and the order Charadriiformes overall, surpassed only by the mancalline &quot;Miomancalla&quot;. It is, however, the largest species to survive into modern times. The great auks that lived farther north averaged larger in size than the more southerly members of the species. Males and females were similar in plumage, although there is evidence for differences in size, particularly in the bill and femur length. The back was primarily a glossy black, and the belly was white. The neck and legs were short, and the head and wings small. During summer, it developed a wide white eye patch over each eye, which had a hazel or chestnut iris. Auks are known for their close resemblance to penguins, their webbed feet and countershading are a result of convergent evolution in the water. During winter the great auk moulted and lost this eye patch, which was replaced with a wide white band and a grey line of feathers that stretched from the eye to the ear. During the summer, its chin and throat were blackish-brown and the inside of the mouth was yellow. In winter, the throat became white. Some individuals reportedly had grey plumage on their flanks, but the purpose, seasonal duration, and frequency of this variation is unknown. The bill was large at long and curved downward at the top; the bill also had deep white grooves in both the upper and lower mandibles, up to seven on the upper mandible and twelve on the lower mandible in summer, although there were fewer in winter. The wings were only in length and the longest wing feathers were only long. Its feet and short claws were black, while the webbed skin between the toes was brownish black. The legs were far back on the bird&#x27;s body, which gave it powerful swimming and diving abilities.

Hatchlings were described as grey and downy, but their exact appearance is unknown, since no skins exist today. Juvenile birds had fewer prominent grooves in their beaks than adults and they had mottled white and black necks, while the eye spot found in adults was not present; instead, a grey line ran through the eyes (which still had white eye rings) to just below the ears.

Great Auk calls included low croaking and a hoarse scream. A captive great auk was observed making a gurgling noise when anxious. It is not known what its other vocalizations were, but it is believed that they were similar to those of the razorbill, only louder and deeper.

==Distribution and habitat==

The great auk was found in the cold North Atlantic coastal waters along the coasts of Canada, the northeastern United States, Norway, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Ireland, Great Britain, France, and the Iberian Peninsula. Pleistocene fossils indicate the great auk also inhabited Southern France, Italy, and other coasts of the Mediterranean basin. It was common on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. In recorded history, the great auk typically did not go farther south than Massachusetts Bay in the winter. Great auk bones have been found as far south as Florida, where it may have been present during four periods: approximately 1000 BC and 1000 AD, as well as during the fifteenth century and the seventeenth century. It has been suggested that some of the bones discovered in Florida may be the result of aboriginal trading. In the eastern Atlantic, the southernmost records of this species are two isolated bones, one from Madeira and another from the Neolithic site of El Harhoura 2 in Morocco.

The great auk left the North Atlantic waters for land only to breed, even roosting at sea when not breeding. The rookeries of the great auk were found from Baffin Bay to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, across the far northern Atlantic, including Iceland, and in Norway and the British Isles in Europe. For their nesting colonies the great auks required rocky islands with sloping shorelines that provided access to the sea. These were very limiting requirements and it is believed that the great auk never had more than 20 breeding colonies. The nesting sites also needed to be close to rich feeding areas and to be far enough from the mainland to discourage visitation by predators such as humans and polar bears. The localities of only seven former breeding colonies are known: Papa Westray in the Orkney Islands, St. Kilda off Scotland, Grimsey Island, Eldey Island, Geirfuglasker near Iceland, Funk Island near Newfoundland, and the Bird Rocks (Rochers-aux-Oiseaux) in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Records suggest that this species may have bred on Cape Cod in Massachusetts. By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the breeding range of the great auk was restricted to Funk Island, Grimsey Island, Eldey Island, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the St. Kilda islands. Funk Island was the largest known breeding colony. After the chicks fledged, the great auk migrated north and south away from the breeding colonies and they tended to go southward during late autumn and winter.

==Ecology and behaviour==

The great auk was never observed and described by modern scientists during its existence and is only known from the accounts of laymen, such as sailors, so its behaviour is not well known and difficult to reconstruct. Much may be inferred from its close, living relative, the razorbill, as well as from remaining soft tissue.

Great auks walked slowly and sometimes used their wings to help them traverse rough terrain. When they did run, it was awkwardly and with short steps in a straight line. They had few natural predators, mainly large marine mammals, such as the orca, and white-tailed eagles. Polar bears preyed on nesting colonies of the great auk. Based on observations by the Naturalist Otto Fabricius (the only scientist to make primary observations on the great auk), some auks were &quot;stupid and tame&quot; whilst others were difficult to approach which he suggested was related to the bird&#x27;s age. Humans preyed upon them as food, for feathers, and as specimens for museums and private collections. Great auks reacted to noises, but were rarely frightened by the sight of something. They used their bills aggressively both in the dense nesting sites and when threatened or captured by humans. These birds are believed to have had a life span of approximately 20 to 25 years. During the winter, the great auk migrated south, either in pairs or in small groups, but never with the entire nesting colony.

The great auk was generally an excellent swimmer, using its wings to propel itself underwater. While swimming, the head was held up but the neck was drawn in. This species was capable of banking, veering, and turning underwater. The great auk was known to dive to depths of and it has been claimed that the species was able to dive to depths of . To conserve energy, most dives were shallow. It also could hold its breath for 15 minutes, longer than a seal. Its ability to dive so deeply reduced competition with other alcid species. The great auk was capable of accelerating underwater, then shooting out of the water to land on a rocky ledge above the ocean&#x27;s surface.

===Diet===

This alcid typically fed in shoaling waters that were shallower than those frequented by other alcids, although after the breeding season, they had been sighted as far as from land. They are believed to have fed cooperatively in flocks. Their main food was fish, usually in length and weighing , but occasionally their prey was up to half the bird&#x27;s own length. Based on remains associated with great auk bones found on Funk Island and on ecological and morphological considerations, it seems that Atlantic menhaden and capelin were their favoured prey. Other fish suggested as potential prey include lumpsuckers, shorthorn sculpins, cod, sand lance, as well as crustaceans. The young of the great auk are believed to have eaten plankton and, possibly, fish and crustaceans regurgitated by adults.

===Reproduction===

Historical descriptions of the great auk breeding behaviour are somewhat unreliable. Great Auks began pairing in early and mid-May. They are believed to have mated for life (although some theorize that great auks could have mated outside their pair, a trait seen in the razorbill). Once paired, they nested at the base of cliffs in colonies, likely where they copulated. Mated pairs had a social display in which they bobbed their heads and displayed their white eye patch, bill markings, and yellow mouth. These colonies were extremely crowded and dense, with some estimates stating that there was a nesting great auk for every of land. These colonies were very social. When the colonies included other species of alcid, the great auks were dominant due to their size.
Female great auks would lay only one egg each year, between late May and early June, although they could lay a replacement egg if the first one was lost. In years when there was a shortage of food, the great auks did not breed. A single egg was laid on bare ground up to from shore. The egg was ovate and elongate in shape, and it averaged in length and across at the widest point. The egg was yellowish white to light ochre with a varying pattern of black, brown, or greyish spots and lines that often were congregated on the large end. It is believed that the variation in the egg streaks enabled the parents to recognize their egg among those in the vast colony. The pair took turns incubating the egg in an upright position for the 39 to 44 days before the egg hatched, typically in June, although eggs could be present at the colonies as late as August.

The parents also took turns feeding their chick. According to one account, the chick was covered with grey down. The young bird took only two or three weeks to mature enough to abandon the nest and land for the water, typically around the middle of July. The parents cared for their young after they fledged, and adults would be seen swimming with their young perched on their backs. Great auks matured sexually when they were four to seven years old.

==Relationship with humans==
The great auk was a food source for Neanderthals more than 100,000 years ago, as evidenced by well-cleaned bones found by their campfires. Images believed to depict the great auk also were carved into the walls of the El Pendo Cave in Camargo, Spain, and Paglicci, Italy, more than 35,000 years ago, and cave paintings 20,000 years old have been found in France&#x27;s Grotte Cosquer.

Native Americans valued the great auk as a food source during the winter and as an important cultural symbol. Images of the great auk have been found in bone necklaces. A person buried at the Maritime Archaic site at Port au Choix, Newfoundland, dating to about 2000 BC, was found surrounded by more than 200 great auk beaks, which are believed to have been part of a suit made from their skins, with the heads left attached as decoration. Nearly half of the bird bones found in graves at this site were of the great auk, suggesting that it had great cultural significance for the Maritime Archaic people. The extinct Beothuks of Newfoundland made pudding out of the eggs of the great auk. The Dorset Eskimos also hunted it. The Saqqaq in Greenland overhunted the species, causing a local reduction in range.

Later, European sailors used the great auks as a navigational beacon, as the presence of these birds signalled that the Grand Banks of Newfoundland were near.

This species is estimated to have had a maximum population in the millions. The great auk was hunted on a significant scale for food, eggs, and its down feathers from at least the eighth century. Prior to that, hunting by local natives may be documented from Late Stone Age Scandinavia and eastern North America, as well as from early fifth century Labrador, where the bird seems to have occurred only as stragglers. Early explorers, including Jacques Cartier, and numerous ships attempting to find gold on Baffin Island were not provisioned with food for the journey home, and therefore, used great auks as both a convenient food source and bait for fishing. Reportedly, some of the later vessels anchored next to a colony and ran out planks to the land. The sailors then herded hundreds of great auks onto the ships, where they were slaughtered. Some authors have questioned the reports of this hunting method and whether it was successful. Great auk eggs were also a valued food source, as the eggs were three times the size of a murre&#x27;s and had a large yolk. These sailors also introduced rats onto the islands which preyed upon nests.

===Extinction===
The Little Ice Age may have reduced the population of the great auk by exposing more of their breeding islands to predation by polar bears, but massive exploitation by humans for their down drastically reduced the population, with recent evidence indicating the latter alone is likely the primary driver of its extinction. By the mid-sixteenth century, the nesting colonies along the European side of the Atlantic were nearly all eliminated by humans killing this bird for its down, which was used to make pillows. In 1553, the great auk received its first official protection. In 1794, Great Britain banned the killing of this species for its feathers. In St. John&#x27;s, those violating a 1775 law banning hunting the great auk for its feathers or eggs were publicly flogged, though hunting for use as fishing bait was still permitted. On the North American side, eider down initially was preferred, but once the eiders were nearly driven to extinction in the 1770s, down collectors switched to the great auk at the same time that hunting for food, fishing bait, and oil decreased.

The great auk had disappeared from Funk Island by 1800. An account by Aaron Thomas of HMS &quot;Boston&quot; from 1794 described how the bird had been slaughtered systematically until then:

With its increasing rarity, specimens of the great auk and its eggs became collectible and highly prized by rich Europeans, and the loss of a large number of its eggs to collection contributed to the demise of the species. Eggers, individuals who visited the nesting sites of the great auk to collect their eggs, quickly realized that the birds did not all lay their eggs on the same day, so they could make return visits to the same breeding colony. Eggers only collected the eggs without embryos and typically, discarded the eggs with embryos growing inside them.

On the islet of Stac an Armin, St. Kilda, Scotland, in July 1840, the last great auk seen in Britain was caught and killed. Three men from St. Kilda caught a single &quot;garefowl&quot;, noticing its little wings and the large white spot on its head. They tied it up and kept it alive for three days, until a large storm arose. Believing that the bird was a witch and was causing the storm, they then killed it by beating it with a stick.

The last colony of great auks lived on Geirfuglasker (the &quot;Great Auk Rock&quot;) off Iceland. This islet was a volcanic rock surrounded by cliffs that made it inaccessible to humans, but in 1830, the islet submerged after a volcanic eruption, and the birds moved to the nearby island of Eldey, which was accessible from a single side. When the colony was discovered in 1835, nearly fifty birds were present. Museums, desiring the skins of the great auk for preservation and display, quickly began collecting birds from the colony. The last pair, found incubating an egg, was killed there on 3 June 1844, on request from a merchant who wanted specimens.

Jón Brandsson and Sigurður Ísleifsson, the men who had killed the last birds, were interviewed by great auk specialist John Wolley, and Sigurður described the act as follows:

A later claim of a live individual sighted in 1852 on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland has been accepted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. 

Alleged sightings of the auk continued for decades after it was believed extinct. The last alleged sighting occurred in the Lofotens in 1927. Errol Fuller noted that several of the later sightings were hoaxes or misidentifications of penguins that had been released near Norway.

There is an ongoing discussion about the possibilities for reviving the great auk using its DNA from specimens collected. This possibility is controversial.

===Preserved specimens===
Today, 78 skins of the great auk remain, mostly in museum collections, along with approximately 75 eggs and 24 complete skeletons. All but four of the surviving skins are in summer plumage, and only two of these are immature. No hatchling specimens exist. Each egg and skin has been assigned a number by specialists. Although thousands of isolated bones were collected from nineteenth century Funk Island to Neolithic middens, only a few complete skeletons exist. Natural mummies also are known from Funk Island, and the eyes and internal organs of the last two birds from 1844 are stored in the Zoological Museum, Copenhagen. The whereabouts of the skins from the last two individuals has been unknown for more than a hundred years, but that mystery has been partly resolved using DNA extracted from the organs of the last individuals and the skins of the candidate specimens suggested by Errol Fuller (those in Übersee-Museum Bremen, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Zoological Museum of Kiel University, Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, and Landesmuseum Natur und Mensch Oldenburg). A positive match was found between the organs from the male individual and the skin now in the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels. No match was found between the female organs and a specimen from Fuller&#x27;s list, but authors speculate that the skin in Cincinnati Museum of Natural History and Science may be a potential candidate due to a common history with the Los Angeles specimen.
Following the bird&#x27;s extinction, remains of the great auk increased dramatically in value, and auctions of specimens created intense interest in Victorian Britain, where 15 specimens are now located, the largest number of any country. A specimen was bought in 1971 by the Icelandic Museum of National History for £9000, which placed it in the Guinness Book of Records as the most expensive stuffed bird ever sold. The price of its eggs sometimes reached up to 11 times the amount earned by a skilled worker in a year. The present whereabouts of six of the eggs are unknown. Several other eggs have been destroyed accidentally. Two mounted skins were destroyed in the twentieth century, one in the Mainz Museum during the Second World War, and one in the Museu Bocage, Lisbon that was destroyed by a fire in 1978.

===Cultural depictions===
====Children&#x27;s books====
Charles Kingsley&#x27;s &quot;The Water-Babies: A Fairy Tale for a Land-Baby&quot; (1863) features the last great auk (referred to in the book as a &quot;gairfowl&quot;) telling the tale of the demise of her species. Different illustrations of the auk are included in the original 1863 version, the 1889 version illustrated by Linley Sambourne, 1916 by Frank A. Nankivell, and 1916 by Jessie Willcox Smith. Kinglsey&#x27;s auk implicates the &quot;nasty fellows&quot; who &quot;shot us so, and knocked us on the head, and took our eggs.&quot; While Kingsley portrays the extinction as sad, he provides his opinion that &quot;there are better things come in her place,&quot; namely human colonization of the islands for the cod fishing industry, which would serve to feed the poor. He concludes the discussion with a quote from Tennyson: &quot;The old order changeth, giving place to the new; And God fulfils Himself in many ways.&quot;

Enid Blyton&#x27;s &quot;The Island of Adventure&quot; (1944) sends one of the protagonists on a failed search for what he believes is a lost colony of the species.

====Literature and journalism====
The great auk is also present in a wide variety of other works of fiction.

In the short story &quot;The Harbor-Master&quot; by Robert W. Chambers, the discovery and attempted recovery of the last known pair of great auks is central to the plot (which also involves a proto-Lovecraftian element of suspense). The story first appeared in &quot;Ainslee&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (August 1898) and was slightly revised to become the first five chapters of Chambers&#x27; episodic novel &quot;In Search of the Unknown&quot;, (Harper and Brothers Publishers, New York, 1904).

&quot;Penguin Island&quot;, a 1908 French satirical novel by the Nobel Prize winning author Anatole France, narrates the fictional history of a great auk population that is mistakenly baptized by a nearsighted missionary.

In his novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922), James Joyce mentions the bird while the novel&#x27;s main character is drifting into sleep. He associates the great auk with the mythical roc as a method of formally returning the main character to a sleepy land of fantasy and memory.

W. S. Merwin mentions the great auk in a short litany of extinct animals in his poem &quot;For a Coming Extinction&quot;, one of the poems from his 1967 collection, &quot;The Lice&quot;.

&quot;Night of the Auk&quot;, a 1956 Broadway drama by Arch Oboler, depicts a group of astronauts returning from the Moon to discover that a full-blown nuclear war has broken out. Obeler draws a parallel between the anthropogenic extinction of the great auk and of the story&#x27;s nuclear extinction of humankind.

A great auk is collected by fictional naturalist Stephen Maturin in the Patrick O&#x27;Brian historical novel &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate&quot; (1980). This work also details the harvesting of a colony of auks.

Farley Mowat devotes the first section, &quot;Spearbill&quot;, of his book &quot;Sea of Slaughter&quot; (1984) to the history of the great auk.

Elizabeth Kolbert&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning book, &quot;The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History&quot; (2014), includes a chapter on the great auk.

====Performing arts====
The great auk is the subject of a ballet, &quot;Still Life at the Penguin Café&quot; (1988), and a song, &quot;A Dream Too Far&quot;, in the ecological musical &quot;Rockford&#x27;s Rock Opera&quot; (2010).

====Mascots====
The great auk is the mascot of the Archmere Academy in Claymont, Delaware, and the Adelaide University Choral Society (AUCS) in Australia.

The great auk was formerly the mascot of the Lindsay Frost campus of Sir Sandford Fleming College in Ontario. In 2012, the two separate sports programs of Fleming College were combined and the great auk mascot went extinct. The Lindsay Frost campus student owned bar, student centre, and lounge is still known as the Auk&#x27;s Lodge.

It was also the mascot of the now ended Knowledge Masters educational competition.

====Names====
The scientific journal of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union, &quot;Ornithology&quot;, was named &quot;The Auk&quot; until 2021 in honour of this bird.

According to Homer Hickam&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Rocket Boys&quot;, and its film production, &quot;October Sky&quot;, the early rockets he and his friends built, were named &quot;Auk&quot;.

A cigarette company, the British Great Auk Cigarettes, was named after this bird.

====Fine arts====
Walton Ford, the American painter, has featured great auks in two paintings: &quot;The Witch of St. Kilda&quot; and &quot;Funk Island&quot;. Replica skins and eggs were made and sold in the 1920s for collectors.

The English painter and writer Errol Fuller produced &quot;Last Stand&quot; for his monograph on the species.

The great auk also appeared on one stamp in a set of five depicting extinct birds issued by Cuba in 1974.

<text>Glorantha is a fantasy world created by Greg Stafford.

==Overview==
It was first introduced in the board game &quot;White Bear and Red Moon&quot; (1975) by Chaosium and then in a number of other board, roleplaying and computer games, including &quot;RuneQuest&quot; and &quot;HeroQuest&quot;, as well as several works of fiction and the computer strategy game &quot;King of Dragon Pass&quot;. The Gloranthan world is characterised by its complex use of mythology, heavily influenced by the universalist approaches of Joseph Campbell and Mircea Eliade, its sword and sorcery ethos, its long and distinctive history as a setting for role-playing games, its community development and expansion, and its relative lack of Tolkienesque influence, which is uncommon among early American fantasy role-playing games.

Stafford first wrote about in Glorantha in 1966 as a way to deepen his own understanding of mythology. He founded the company Chaosium to publish the board wargame &quot;White Bear and Red Moon&quot; in 1975, which was set in Glorantha. Chaosium later published other games in the setting, including the critically acclaimed &quot;RuneQuest&quot;. Various later editions of &quot;RuneQuest&quot;, the narrative role-playing game &quot;HeroQuest&quot; (the first edition of which was published as &quot;Hero Wars&quot;), and the video game &quot;King of Dragon Pass&quot; were also set in Glorantha, as were several prominent fan efforts. Stafford has also explored the Gloranthan setting in the fantasy novel &quot;King of Sartar&quot; and a number of unfinished works published under the collective name of &quot;the Stafford Library&quot;.

In Glorantha, magic operates from the everyday level of prayers and charms to the creation and maintenance of the world. Heroes make their way in the world, and may also venture into metaphysical realms to gain knowledge and power, at the risk of body and soul. In the more recent material, competing magical outlooks (such as theism, shamanism and mysticism) exist to explain the world. Within each metaphysical system, adherents may also compete, such as when theistic worshipers of rival gods battle each other. The world is flat, with a dome-like sky, and it has been shaped in large and small ways by the mythic actions of the gods. The &#x27;historical&#x27; world of Glorantha is in a more or less fallen state, having recovered only partially from a universal battle against Chaos in the mythic Godtime.

Humans are the dominant race, but other sentient beings abound. Some, such as the mystic dragonewts, are unique to Glorantha. Familiar nonhuman races, such as elves and dwarves, are distinct from their common, Tolkienesque portrayals.

==History of the Gloranthan game world==
===Early development (1960s–1970s)===
Glorantha&#x27;s origins lie in experiments with mythology, storytelling, recreation, and the blending of ancient societies. It is unlike its contemporary, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; which has its roots in wargaming.

Stafford&#x27;s first imaginings of Glorantha date back to 1966, when he began his studies at Beloit College, as a vehicle for him to deepen his own understanding of mythology by creating his own mythology. Stafford was greatly influenced by the ideas on the mythology of Joseph Campbell, and echoes of Campbell&#x27;s work are to be found in many aspects of Glorantha; for instance, the story of the &quot;God Learners&quot; can be seen as an exercise on the implications of Campbell&#x27;s idea of a unifying monomyth, and the story of Prince Argrath an exploration of Campbell&#x27;s &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; (1949). More abstractly, Campbell&#x27;s idea that myths are how we shape our lives deeply informs the picture of life in Glorantha throughout the game world&#x27;s publication history.

The first game set in Glorantha was the board game &quot;White Bear and Red Moon&quot;. The game details a time of constant war between the land of Sartar and the Lunar Empire during the reign of Argrath Dragontooth. Its board details an area called Dragon Pass, while the rulebook provides details of the warring factions, their lands, and leaders. In addition, it provides a large-scale map titled the Greater Lunar Empire, showing a larger world in which Dragon Pass is placed. The &quot;White Bear and Red Moon&quot; does not disclose the name of the world.

&quot;Nomad Gods&quot;, a second board game, published by Chaosium in 1978, and based on the raids and wars between the beast-riding, spirit-worshiping tribes of Prax, a cursed land located east of Dragon Pass. It also did not mention the world by name.

In 1978, after the publication of &quot;Nomad Gods&quot;, and prior to the publication of RuneQuest, the name Glorantha appeared in print for the first time. &quot;Wyrm&#x27;s Footnotes&quot; #4 contained three articles on Glorantha and a map of the world itself.

===In role-playing games (late 1970s – 1990s)===
The first edition of the role-playing game &quot;RuneQuest&quot; was released in 1978. Here, the world was referred to as &quot;Glorontha&quot;. Several later editions were made; the second edition (&quot;RuneQuest 2&quot;) in 1979 introduced many sophisticated game aids, such as &quot;Cults of Prax&quot; and &quot;Cults of Terror&quot;, and polished campaign packs such as &quot;Griffin Mountain&quot;. Using materials such as &quot;Cults of Prax&quot;, players aligned their characters with any of a number of religions, grounding those characters in the political, cultural, and metaphysical conflicts of the setting. Each religion offered a distinct worldview and cultural outlook, none of which considered objectively correct out-of-character. This approach of offering competing mythical histories and value systems continues in current Glorantha material. &quot;Cults of Terror&quot; focused on the worship of evil gods and adversaries, such as Vivamort, a vampire cult, and Lunar and Chaos cults.

In 1993, Stafford published his first major expansion of Gloranthan mythology, the novel &quot;King of Sartar&quot;. This was a departure from previous Gloranthan material, which had all been targeted at a tabletop role-playing game audience.

In an attempt to leverage the power of a much bigger gaming company, a third edition of &quot;RuneQuest&quot;, was published with Avalon Hill in 1984. The default setting for this edition was given as the &quot;Dark Ages of fantasy Europe&quot;, but it also included a booklet allowing use in Glorantha. Later supplements such as &quot;Gods of Glorantha&quot; expanded religious aspects, while &quot;&quot; did the same for culture and geography.

In the mid-1990s, Avalon Hill began work on a fourth edition of &quot;RuneQuest&quot;, subtitled &quot;Adventures in Glorantha&quot;. Stafford did not approve of the project and it was canceled. &quot;RuneQuest&quot; did not prosper with its association with Avalon Hill, and the relationship between Chaosium, who held the rights to Glorantha, and Avalon Hill, who held the rights to &quot;RuneQuest&quot;, broke down completely in 1995. Following the break with Chaosium, Avalon Hill began to assert their trademark to the RuneQuest name, began work on &quot;&quot;. This was unrelated to Glorantha and the third edition rules. The project was canceled just before printing in 1998.

During this period of breakdown, Glorantha continued to evolve. The advent of the Internet caused a boom in fan creations for Glorantha. This was supported by several unofficial business ventures, such as Reaching Moon Megacorp, and a lively convention scene. Loren Miller proposed his Maximum Game Fun principle as a basis for gaming in Glorantha; this soon became a game system in its own right. David Dunham proposed his &quot;PenDragon Pass&quot; system, a nearly freeform game system, and several ambitious freeform games were played at conventions. One such game, &quot;Home of the Bold&quot;, hosted up to eighty participants.

The video game &quot;King of Dragon Pass&quot; was released by A Sharp in 1999. The player assumes the role of an Orlanthi hero who seeks to unite the clans and tribes of Dragon Pass into a single kingdom. The game features exceptional depth of coverage of the area of Dragon Pass, and featured the first compelling public view of Stafford&#x27;s ideas about the hero&#x27;s quest. Stafford was also self publishing additional material at this time about the history and mythology of Glorantha in non-game form in &quot;The Glorious (Re)Ascent of Yelm&quot;.

===21st century===
In 2000, Issaries, Inc. published &quot;Hero Wars&quot;, a new Gloranthan role-playing game unrelated to RuneQuest. Its next iteration in 2003 was named &quot;HeroQuest&quot; and later in 2008, Moon Design Publications published an updated second edition. 2016 saw Moon Design publish &quot;HeroQuest Glorantha&quot;, completely integrating Glorantha into the rules. 2006 saw &quot;RuneQuest&quot; licensed from Issaries by Mongoose Publishing with a second edition in 2010. In 2012, The Design Mechanism published the sixth edition of RuneQuest, with no Gloranthan content. Glorantha returned in 2018 with Chaosium publishing &quot;RuneQuest - Roleplaying in Glorantha&quot;.

====&quot;Hero Wars&quot; and &quot;HeroQuest&quot;====
The &quot;HeroQuest&quot; game system, written by Robin Laws in collaboration with Greg Stafford, is a complete departure from &quot;RuneQuest&quot;. The former leverages quick contests and open, almost free-form style of skills and abilities to emulate a mythic structure of play, with rising and falling tensions that contrast with the more naturalistic focus taken by &quot;RuneQuest&quot;. Owing to this approach, in approach some &quot;RuneQuest&quot; fans found it difficult to adjust to &quot;HeroQuest&quot;. A rewritten second edition was published in Spring 2009 by Moon Design Publications. It was supported with comprehensive Gloranthan sourcebooks &quot;Sartar: Kingdom of Heroes&quot; (2009), &quot;Sartar Companion&quot; (2010) and &quot;Pavis: Gateway to Adventure&quot; (2012).

====RuneQuest====
In 2006, &quot;RuneQuest&quot; was licensed to Mongoose Publishing by Issaries. Their new edition of the rules, were not set in Glorantha, and required a further supplemement, &quot;Glorantha – The Second Age&quot; to play. Written by Robin Laws, it was set in the Second Age of Gloratha&#x27;s history against the backdrop of The God Learner empire and the Empire of Wyrm&#x27;s Friend. In this edition, Mongoose produced 17 supplements and adventures based in Glorantha, alongside their generic fantasy background.

A second edition &quot;Mongoose RuneQuest II&quot; was published in January 2010, but Mongoose Publishing&#x27;s licence for Gloranthan material lapsed in May 2011. The &quot;RuneQuest II&quot; game system has been retitled &quot;Legend&quot;, and contains no Gloranthan material. A new company, The Design Mechanism, was formed by the authors of &quot;RuneQuest II&quot;, and ownership of the Gloranthan supplements produced for the &quot;RuneQuest II&quot; line was transferred to them (PDF versions continued to be sold). There are close links between The Design Mechanism and Moon Design Publications, with The Design Mechanism founders writing material for both companies. Their new edition of the RuneQuest rules, &quot;RuneQuest: Sixth Edition&quot;, did not have a Gloranthan setting.

In 2018 Chaosium published RuneQuest - Roleplaying in Glorantha. Wholly set in Glorantha, it advanced the in-game date to 1625, and focuses once again on Dragon Pass. Along with its two slipcase companions, it provides a complete overview of this region. Again the village of Apple Lane in the homeland of Sartar is used as a starting adventure setting, but updated to the year 1625. Two further supplements concentrate on specific areas within Dragon Pass.

==The World of Glorantha==

The Glorantha website introduces Glorantha as follows:
Glorantha is an action-packed world of adventure. Gods and Goddesses struggle here, with nations of people nothing but their pawns. The stormy barbarians with their brutal but honest Storm God struggle against the Lunar Empire, led by the imperial Sun God and devious Moon Goddess.

Glorantha is an exciting world of heroes. Legends are being made by great individuals, many who are not even human beings. Some work with the deities, other heroes and heroines fight against them.

Glorantha is colorful and full of magic. Supernatural animals are found, ranging from unicorns to seven types of merfolk and the Goddess of Lions.

Glorantha is immense. If explored, it has different worlds and dimensions, whole realms where Gods, spirits and sorcerous powers come from. Unlike many fantasy settings, Glorantha emphasises religion, myth and belief to a level rarely seen in role-playing or fantasy fiction elsewhere.

Glorantha shares some fantasy tropes such as dwarves, elves, trolls, giants, but has developed them differently to the more conventional versions based on the work of Tolkien. Dwarves are literally made of stone and exist as manifest rigid inflexible laws of creation, while elves are intelligent, mobile plants. Glorantha is full of surprises.

Glorantha is as deep as you want it to be, or not. Hackers and choppers have what they want, while scholars and mythologists have a vast playground of new stories, legends and myths to enjoy.
It has various cultures analogous to Earth spread over two major landmasses and a wide archipelago. The northern continent of Genertela has a caste society of roughly Vedic type to the west, an autocratic Oriental society to the east and a classical-style Bronze Age culture in the center. The southern continent of Pamaltela is analogous to Africa.

==Creatures of Glorantha==
Broos are creatures of chaos. As they can fruitfully mate with anything, they have the body of a man and features of their animal parent, often deer, goats, antelope, cattle, and sheep. The animal parent normally dies when the child eats its way out of the host at full gestation. They worship Malia, the Mother of Disease, and Thed, the goddess of rape and mother of Chaos.

Scorpionmen are belligerent and resemble scorpion-human centaur. They are stupid, vicious and live in violent matriarchies with a religious emphasis on devouring. They are chaotic in nature.

Ducks or &quot;Durulz&quot; are flightless humanoid duck-like creatures who have arms rather than wings (or men cursed with feathers and webbed feet). They have unknown ancestry and may descend from cursed humans or cursed ducks. They reside around rivers, mainly in Sartar, and have an unexplained mystical affinity with Death.

Aldryami or Gloranthan elves, are plant people. They worship nature and the sun and Aldrya, deity of plants, specifically. In contrast to Tolkienesque elves, they are alien, physically plant-like and unfriendly to &quot;meat men&quot; (humans). Like many other fantasy fictional elf races, they are excellent archers.

Mostali are machine-like dwarves. They are xenophobic, orthodox and insular. They have invented iron, which has many extraordinary magical properties in Glorantha, contrasting to the primary metal used bronze.

Uz, the trolls, are the race of darkness, large, intelligent, astoundingly omnivorous, with a very developed sonar-like sense (&quot;darksense&quot;). Their societies are matriarchal, and they worship, among others, a goddess of darkness called Kyger Litor, mother of the Trolls, and the more violent and sinister Zorak Zoran.

Dragonewts are a magical race made up of forms of neotenic dragons. They are engaged in a cycle of self-improving reincarnation. They are alien, with an incomprehensible mindset. They must have oral surgery in order to speak human languages.

==Multimedia Glorantha==
Glorantha has been the background for a number of different media, and numerous pieces of myth and fiction created by the Glorantha community, featured in magazines such as &quot;Tales of the Reaching Moon&quot;. Several hundred gaming miniatures by various licensees and about a dozen plush toys have also been produced at various times.

<text>Garnet Edward&quot;Ace&quot;Bailey (June 13, 1948 – September 11, 2001) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player and scout who was a member of Stanley Cup and Memorial Cup-winning teams. He died at the age of 53 while aboard United Airlines Flight 175, which was deliberately crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City during the September 11 attacks.

==Career==
At the time of his death, Bailey was the Los Angeles Kings&#x27; director of pro scouting.

==Death and legacy==
Bailey died when the plane in which he was travelling, United Airlines Flight 175, was hijacked and deliberately crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City during the September 11 attacks. Bailey and amateur scout Mark Bavis were travelling from Boston to Los Angeles when the flight was hijacked. They had been in Manchester visiting the Los Angeles Kings&#x27; AHL affiliate, the Monarchs.

Bailey and Bavis are mentioned in the Boston-based Dropkick Murphys song &quot;Your Spirit&#x27;s Alive.&quot; Denis Leary wore a Bailey memorial T-shirt as the character Tommy Gavin in the season 1 episode &quot;Immortal&quot; and the fourth-season episode &quot;Pussified&quot; in the TV series &quot;Rescue Me&quot;. In his memory, the Los Angeles Kings named their new mascot &quot;Bailey&quot;.

Bailey&#x27;s family founded the Ace Bailey Children&#x27;s Foundation in his memory. The foundation raises funds to benefit hospitalized children, infants and their families.

At the National September 11 Memorial, Bailey and Bavis are memorialized at the South Pool, on Panel S-3. On October 14, 2012, the Kings brought the Stanley Cup, which the team had just won in June, to the memorial and placed it on panels featuring Bailey and Bavis&#x27;s names so that the families of Bailey and Bavis could &quot;[have] their day with the Stanley Cup&quot;, continuing a hockey tradition whereby players and personnel of the reigning Cup champion team each get a personal day with the trophy. The Kings&#x27; general manager Dean Lombardi was also in attendance.

<doc id="12557" wikidata="Q184226" url="?curid=12557" title="Gilles Deleuze">
<text>Gilles Louis René Deleuze ( ; ; 18 January 1925 – 4 November 1995) was a French philosopher who, from the early 1950s until his death in 1995, wrote on philosophy, literature, film, and fine art. His most popular works were the two volumes of &quot;Capitalism and Schizophrenia&quot;: &quot;Anti-Oedipus&quot; (1972) and &quot;A Thousand Plateaus&quot; (1980), both co-written with psychoanalyst Félix Guattari. His metaphysical treatise &quot;Difference and Repetition&quot; (1968) is considered by many scholars to be his magnum opus.

An important part of Deleuze&#x27;s oeuvre is devoted to the reading of other philosophers: the , Leibniz, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche, Spinoza, and Bergson. A. W. Moore, citing Bernard Williams&#x27;s criteria for a great thinker, ranks Deleuze among the &quot;greatest philosophers&quot;. Although he once characterized himself as a &quot;pure metaphysician&quot;, his work has influenced a variety of disciplines across the humanities, including philosophy, art, and literary theory, as well as movements such as post-structuralism and postmodernism.

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Gilles Deleuze was born into a middle-class family in Paris and lived there for most of his life. His mother was Odette Camaüer and his father, Louis, was an engineer. His initial schooling was undertaken during World War II, during which time he attended the Lycée Carnot. He also spent a year in &quot;khâgne&quot; at the Lycée Henri IV. During the Nazi occupation of France, Deleuze&#x27;s brother, three years his senior, Georges, was arrested for his participation in the French Resistance, and died while in transit to a concentration camp. In 1944, Deleuze went to study at the Sorbonne. His teachers there included several noted specialists in the history of philosophy, such as Georges Canguilhem, Jean Hyppolite, Ferdinand Alquié, and Maurice de Gandillac. Deleuze&#x27;s lifelong interest in the canonical figures of modern philosophy owed much to these teachers.

=== Career ===
Deleuze passed the agrégation in philosophy in 1948, and taught at various lycées (Amiens, Orléans, Louis le Grand) until 1957, when he took up a position at the University of Paris. In 1953, he published his first monograph, &quot;Empiricism and Subjectivity&quot;, on David Hume. This monograph was based on his 1947 DES (&quot;&quot;) thesis, roughly equivalent to an M.A. thesis, which was conducted under the direction of Jean Hyppolite and Georges Canguilhem. From 1960 to 1964, he held a position at the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique. During this time he published the seminal &quot;Nietzsche and Philosophy&quot; (1962) and befriended Michel Foucault. From 1964 to 1969, he was a professor at the University of Lyon. In 1968, Deleuze defended his two DrE dissertations amid the ongoing May 68 demonstrations; he later published his two dissertations under the titles &quot;Difference and Repetition&quot; (supervised by Gandillac) and &quot;Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza&quot; (supervised by Alquié).

In 1969, he was appointed to the University of Paris VIII, an experimental school organized to implement educational reform. This new university drew a number of well-known academics, including Foucault (who suggested Deleuze&#x27;s hiring) and the psychoanalyst Félix Guattari. Deleuze taught at Paris VIII until his retirement in 1987.

===Personal life===
Deleuze&#x27;s outlook on life was sympathetic to transcendental ideas, &quot;nature as god&quot; ethics, and the monist experience. Some of the important ideas he advocated for and found inspiration in include his personally coined expression pluralism = monism, as well as the concepts of Being and Univocity.

He married Denise Paul &quot;Fanny&quot; Grandjouan in 1956 and they had two children.

According to James Miller, Deleuze portrayed little visible interest in actually &quot;doing&quot; many of the risky things he so vividly conjured up in his lectures and writing. Married, with two children, he outwardly lived the life of a conventional French professor. He kept his fingernails untrimmed because, as he once explained, he lacked &quot;normal protective fingerprints&quot;, and therefore could not &quot;touch an object, particularly a piece of cloth, with the pads of my fingers without sharp pain&quot;.

When once asked to talk about his life, he replied: &quot;Academics&#x27; lives are seldom interesting.&quot; Deleuze concludes his reply to this critic thus:

===Death===
Deleuze, who had suffered from respiratory ailments from a young age, developed tuberculosis in 1968 and underwent lung removal. He suffered increasingly severe respiratory symptoms for the rest of his life. In the last years of his life, simple tasks such as writing required laborious effort. Overwhelmed by his respiratory problems, he died by suicide on 4 November 1995, throwing himself from the window of his apartment.

Before his death, Deleuze had announced his intention to write a book entitled &quot;La Grandeur de Marx&quot; (&quot;The Greatness of Marx&quot;), and left behind two chapters of an unfinished project entitled &quot;Ensembles and Multiplicities&quot; (these chapters have been published as the essays &quot;Immanence: A Life&quot; and &quot;The Actual and the Virtual&quot;). He is buried in the cemetery of the village of Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat.

== Philosophy ==
Deleuze&#x27;s works fall into two groups: on the one hand, monographs interpreting the work of other philosophers (Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche, Henri Bergson, Michel Foucault) and artists (Marcel Proust, Franz Kafka, Francis Bacon); on the other, eclectic philosophical tomes organized by concept (e.g., difference, sense, event, economy, cinema, desire, philosophy). However, both of these aspects are seen by his critics and analysts as often overlapping, in particular, due to his prose and the unique mapping of his books that allow for multifaceted readings.

=== Metaphysics ===
Deleuze&#x27;s main philosophical project in the works he wrote prior to his collaborations with Guattari can be summarized as an inversion of the traditional metaphysical relationship between identity and difference. Traditionally, difference is seen as derivative from identity: e.g., to say that &quot;X is different from Y&quot; assumes some X and Y with at least relatively stable identities (as in Plato&#x27;s forms). On the contrary, Deleuze claims that all identities are effects of difference. Identities are neither logically nor metaphysically prior to difference, Deleuze argues, &quot;given that there exist differences of nature between things of the same genus.&quot; That is, not only are no two things ever the same, the categories used to identify individuals in the first place derive from differences. Apparent identities such as &quot;X&quot; are composed of endless series of differences, where &quot;X&quot; = &quot;the difference between x and xformula_1&quot;, and &quot;xformula_1&quot; = &quot;the difference between...&quot;, and so forth. Difference, in other words, goes all the way down. To confront reality honestly, Deleuze argues, beings must be grasped exactly as they are, and concepts of identity (forms, categories, resemblances, unities of apperception, predicates, etc.) fail to attain what he calls &quot;difference in itself.&quot; &quot;If philosophy has a positive and direct relation to things, it is only insofar as philosophy claims to grasp the thing itself, according to what it is, in its difference from everything it is not, in other words, in its &quot;internal difference&quot;.&quot;

Like Kant, Deleuze considers traditional notions of space and time as unifying forms imposed by the subject. He, therefore, concludes that pure difference is non-spatiotemporal; it is an idea, what Deleuze calls &quot;the virtual&quot;. (The coinage refers to Proust&#x27;s definition of what is constant in both the past and the present: &quot;real without being actual, ideal without being abstract.&quot;) While Deleuze&#x27;s virtual ideas superficially resemble Plato&#x27;s forms and Kant&#x27;s ideas of pure reason, they are not originals or models, nor do they transcend possible experience; instead they are the conditions of actual experience, the internal difference in itself. &quot;The concept they [the conditions] form is identical to its object.&quot; A Deleuzean idea or concept of difference is therefore not a wraith-like abstraction of an experienced thing, it is a real system of differential relations that creates actual spaces, times, and sensations.

Thus, Deleuze at times refers to his philosophy as a transcendental empiricism (), alluding to Kant. In Kant&#x27;s transcendental idealism, experience only makes sense when organized by intuitions (namely, space and time) and concepts (such as causality). Assuming the content of these intuitions and concepts to be qualities of the world as it exists independently of human perceptual access, according to Kant, spawns seductive but senseless metaphysical beliefs (for example, extending the concept of causality beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause). Deleuze inverts the Kantian arrangement: experience exceeds human concepts by presenting novelty, and this raw experience of difference actualizes an idea, unfettered by prior categories, forcing the invention of new ways of thinking (see &quot;Epistemology&quot;).

Simultaneously, Deleuze claims that being is univocal, i.e., that all of its senses are affirmed in one voice. Deleuze borrows the doctrine of &quot;ontological univocity&quot; from the medieval philosopher John Duns Scotus. In medieval disputes over the nature of God, many eminent theologians and philosophers (such as Thomas Aquinas) held that when one says that &quot;God is good&quot;, God&#x27;s goodness is only analogous to human goodness. Scotus argued to the contrary that when one says that &quot;God is good&quot;, the goodness in question is exactly the same sort of goodness that is meant when one says &quot;Jane is good&quot;. That is, God only differs from humans in degree, and properties such as goodness, power, reason, and so forth are univocally applied, regardless of whether one is talking about God, a person, or a flea.

Deleuze adapts the doctrine of univocity to claim that being is, univocally, difference. &quot;With univocity, however, it is not the differences which are and must be: it is being which is Difference, in the sense that it is said of difference. Moreover, it is not we who are univocal in a Being which is not; it is we and our individuality which remains equivocal in and for a univocal Being.&quot; Here Deleuze at once echoes and inverts Spinoza, who maintained that everything that exists is a modification of the one substance, God or Nature. For Deleuze, there is no one substance, only an always-differentiating process, an origami cosmos, always folding, unfolding, refolding. Deleuze summarizes this ontology in the paradoxical formula &quot;pluralism = monism&quot;.

&quot;Difference and Repetition&quot; (1968) is Deleuze&#x27;s most sustained and systematic attempt to work out the details of such a metaphysics, but his other works develop similar ideas. In &quot;Nietzsche and Philosophy&quot; (1962), for example, reality is a play of forces; in &quot;Anti-Oedipus&quot; (1972), a &quot;body without organs&quot;; in &quot;What is Philosophy?&quot; (1991), a &quot;plane of immanence&quot; or &quot;chaosmos&quot;.

=== Epistemology ===
Deleuze&#x27;s unusual metaphysics entails an equally atypical epistemology, or what he calls a transformation of &quot;the image of thought&quot;. According to Deleuze, the traditional image of thought, found in philosophers such as Aristotle, René Descartes, and Edmund Husserl, misconceives thinking as a mostly unproblematic business. Truth may be hard to discover—it may require a life of pure theorizing, or rigorous computation, or systematic doubt—but thinking is able, at least in principle, to correctly grasp facts, forms, ideas, etc. It may be practically impossible to attain a God&#x27;s-eye, neutral point of view, but that is the ideal to approximate: a disinterested pursuit that results in a determinate, fixed truth; an orderly extension of common sense. Deleuze rejects this view as papering over the metaphysical flux, instead claiming that genuine thinking is a violent confrontation with reality, an involuntary rupture of established categories. Truth changes thought; it alters what people think is possible. By setting aside the assumption that thinking has a natural ability to recognize the truth, Deleuze says, people attain a &quot;thought without image&quot;, a thought always determined by problems rather than solving them. &quot;All this, however, presupposes codes or axioms which do not result by chance, but which do not have an intrinsic rationality either. It&#x27;s just like theology: everything about it is quite rational if you accept sin, the immaculate conception, and the incarnation. Reason is always a region carved out of the irrational—not sheltered from the irrational at all, but traversed by it and only defined by a particular kind of relationship among irrational factors. Underneath all reason lies delirium, and drift.&quot;

&quot;The Logic of Sense&quot;, published in 1969, is one of Deleuze&#x27;s most peculiar works in the field of epistemology. Michel Foucault, in his essay &quot;Theatrum Philosophicum&quot; about the book, attributed this to how he begins with his metaphysics but approaches it through language and truth; the book is focused on &quot;the simple condition that instead of denouncing metaphysics as the neglect of being, we force it to speak of extrabeing&quot;. In it, he refers to epistemological paradoxes: in the first series, as he analyzes Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, he remarks that &quot;the personal self requires God and the world in general. But when substantives and adjectives begin to dissolve, when the names of pause and rest are carried away by the verbs of pure becoming and slide into the language of events, all identity disappears from the self, the world, and God.&quot;

Deleuze&#x27;s peculiar readings of the history of philosophy stem from this unusual epistemological perspective. To read a philosopher is no longer to aim at finding a single, correct interpretation, but is instead to present a philosopher&#x27;s attempt to grapple with the problematic nature of reality. &quot;Philosophers introduce new concepts, they explain them, but they don&#x27;t tell us, not completely anyway, the problems to which those concepts are a response. [...] The history of philosophy, rather than repeating what a philosopher says, has to say what he must have taken for granted, what he didn&#x27;t say but is nonetheless present in what he did say.&quot;

Likewise, rather than seeing philosophy as a timeless pursuit of truth, reason, or universals, Deleuze defines philosophy as the creation of concepts. For Deleuze, concepts are not identity conditions or propositions, but metaphysical constructions that define a range of thinking, such as Plato&#x27;s ideas, Descartes&#x27;s &quot;cogito&quot;, or Kant&#x27;s doctrine of the faculties. A philosophical concept &quot;posits itself and its object at the same time as it is created.&quot; In Deleuze&#x27;s view, then, philosophy more closely resembles practical or artistic production than it does an adjunct to a definitive scientific description of a pre-existing world (as in the tradition of John Locke or Willard Van Orman Quine).

In his later work (from roughly 1981 onward), Deleuze sharply distinguishes art, philosophy, and science as three distinct disciplines, each relating to reality in different ways. While philosophy creates concepts, the arts create novel qualitative combinations of sensation and feeling (what Deleuze calls &quot;percepts&quot; and &quot;affects&quot;), and the sciences create quantitative theories based on fixed points of reference such as the speed of light or absolute zero (which Deleuze calls &quot;functives&quot;). According to Deleuze, none of these disciplines enjoy primacy over the others: they are different ways of organizing the metaphysical flux, &quot;separate melodic lines in constant interplay with one another.&quot; For example, Deleuze does not treat cinema as an art representing an external reality, but as an ontological practice that creates different ways of organizing movement and time. Philosophy, science, and art are equally, and essentially, creative and practical. Hence, instead of asking traditional questions of identity such as &quot;is it true?&quot; or &quot;what is it?&quot;, Deleuze proposes that inquiries should be functional or practical: &quot;what does it do?&quot; or &quot;how does it work?&quot;

=== Values ===

In ethics and politics Deleuze again echoes Spinoza, albeit in a sharply Nietzschean key. Following his rejection of any metaphysics based on identity, Deleuze criticizes the notion of an individual as an arresting or halting of differentiation (as the etymology of the word &quot;individual&quot; suggests). Guided by the naturalistic ethics of Spinoza and Nietzsche, Deleuze instead seeks to understand individuals and their moralities as products of the organization of pre-individual desires and powers. 

In the two volumes of &quot;Capitalism and Schizophrenia&quot;, &quot;Anti-Oedipus&quot; (1972) and &quot;A Thousand Plateaus&quot; (1980), Deleuze and Guattari describe history as a congealing and regimentation of &quot;desiring-production&quot; (a concept combining features of Freudian drives and Marxist labor) into the modern individual (typically neurotic and repressed), the nation-state (a society of continuous control), and capitalism (an anarchy domesticated into infantilizing commodification). Deleuze, following Karl Marx, welcomes capitalism&#x27;s destruction of traditional social hierarchies as liberating but inveighs against its homogenization of all values to the aims of the market.

The first part of &quot;Capitalism and Schizophrenia&quot; undertakes a universal history and posits the existence of a separate socius (the social body that takes credit for production) for each mode of production: the earth for the tribe, the body of the despot for the empire, and capital for capitalism.&quot;

In his 1990 essay &quot;Postscript on the Societies of Control&quot; (&quot;Post-scriptum sur les sociétés de contrôle&quot;), Deleuze builds on Foucault&#x27;s notion of the society of discipline to argue that society is undergoing a shift in structure and control. Where societies of discipline were characterized by discrete physical enclosures (such as schools, factories, prisons, office buildings, etc.), institutions and technologies introduced since World War II have dissolved the boundaries between these enclosures. As a result, social coercion and discipline have moved into the lives of individuals considered as &quot;masses, samples, data, markets, or &#x27;banks&#x27;.&quot; The mechanisms of modern societies of control are described as continuous, following and tracking individuals throughout their existence via transaction records, mobile location tracking, and other personally identifiable information.

But how does Deleuze square his pessimistic diagnoses with his ethical naturalism? Deleuze claims that standards of value are internal or immanent: to live well is to fully express one&#x27;s power, to go to the limits of one&#x27;s potential, rather than to judge what exists by non-empirical, transcendent standards. Modern society still suppresses difference and alienates people from what they can do. To affirm reality, which is a flux of change and difference, established identities must be overturned and so become all that they can become—though exactly what cannot be known in advance. The pinnacle of Deleuzean practice, then, is creativity. &quot;Herein, perhaps, lies the secret: to bring into existence and not to judge. If it is so disgusting to judge, it is not because everything is of equal value, but on the contrary, because what has value can be made or distinguished only by defying judgment. What expert judgment, in art, could ever bear on the work to come?&quot;

=== Deleuze&#x27;s interpretations ===
Deleuze&#x27;s studies of individual philosophers and artists are purposely heterodox. Deleuze once famously described his method of interpreting philosophers as &quot;buggery (&quot;enculage&quot;)&quot;, as sneaking behind an author and producing an offspring which is recognizably his, yet also monstrous and different.

The various monographs thus are not attempts to present what Nietzsche or Spinoza strictly intended, but re-stagings of their ideas in different and unexpected ways. Deleuze&#x27;s peculiar readings aim to enact the creativity he believes is the acme of philosophical practice. A parallel in painting Deleuze points to is Francis Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Study after Velázquez&quot;—it is quite beside the point to say that Bacon &quot;gets Velasquez wrong&quot;. Similar considerations apply, in Deleuze&#x27;s view, to his own uses of mathematical and scientific terms, &quot;pace&quot; critics such as Alan Sokal: &quot;I&#x27;m not saying that Resnais and Prigogine, or Godard and Thom, are doing the same thing. I&#x27;m pointing out, rather, that there are remarkable similarities between scientific creators of functions and cinematic creators of images. And the same goes for philosophical concepts, since there are distinct concepts of these spaces.&quot;

=== Similarities with Heidegger ===
From the 1930s onward, German philosopher Martin Heidegger wrote in a series of manuscripts and books on concepts of Difference, Identity, Representation, and Event; notably among these the &quot;Beiträge zur Philosophie&quot; &quot;(Vom Ereignis)&quot; (Written 1936-38; published posthumously 1989); none of the relevant texts were translated into French by Deleuze&#x27;s death in 1995, excluding any strong possibility of appropriation. However, Heidegger&#x27;s early work can be traced through mathematician Albert Lautman, who drew heavily from Heidegger&#x27;s &quot;Sein und Zeit&quot; and &quot;Vom Wesen des Grundes&quot; (1928), which James Bahoh describes as having &quot;...decisive influence on the twentieth century mathematician and philosopher [...] whose theory of dialectical Ideas Deleuze appropriated and modified for his own use.&quot; The similarities between Heidegger&#x27;s later, post-turn, 1930-1976 thought and Deleuze&#x27;s early works in the 60s and 70s are generally described by Deleuze-scholar Daniel W. Smith in the following way: &quot;&quot;Difference and Repetition&quot; could be read as a response to &quot;Being and Time&quot; (for Deleuze, Being is difference, and time is repetition).&quot;Bahoh continues in saying that: &quot;...then &quot;Beiträge&quot; could be read as &quot;Difference and Repetition&quot;&#x27;s unknowing and anachronistic doppelgänger.&quot; Deleuze and Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy is considered to converge on the topics of Difference and the Event. Where, for Heidegger, an evental being is constituted in part by difference as &quot;...an essential dimension of the concept of event&quot;; for Deleuze, being is difference, and difference &quot;differentiates by way of events.&quot; In contrast to this, however, Jussi Backman argues that, for Heidegger, being is united only insofar as it consists of and &quot;is&quot; difference, or rather as the movement of difference, not too dissimilar to Deleuze&#x27;s later claims:&quot;...the unity and univocity of being (in the sense of being), its &#x27;selfsameness,&#x27; paradoxically consists exclusively in difference.&quot;This mutual apprehension of a differential, Evental ontology lead both thinkers into an extended critique of the representation characteristic to Platonic, Aristotelian, and Cartesian thought; as Joe Hughes states: &quot;&quot;Difference and Repetition&quot; is a detective novel. It tells the story of what some readers of Deleuze might consider a horrendous crime [...]: the birth of representation.&quot; Heidegger formed his critiques most decisively in the concept of the fourfold [&quot;German: das Geviert&quot;], a non-metaphysical grounding for the thing (as opposed to &quot;object&quot;) as &quot;ungrounded, mediated, meaningful, and shared&quot; united in an &quot;event of appropriation&quot; [&quot;Ereignis&quot;]. This evental ontology continues in &quot;Identität und Differenz&quot;, where the fundamental concept expressed in &quot;Difference and Repetition&quot;, of dethroning the primacy of identity, can be seen throughout the text. Even in earlier Heideggerian texts such as &quot;Sein und Zeit&quot;, however, the critique of representation is &quot;...cast in terms of the being of truth, or the processes of uncovering and covering (grounded in Dasein&#x27;s existence) whereby beings come into and withdraw from phenomenal presence.&quot; In parallel, Deleuze&#x27;s extended critique of representation (in the sense of detailing a &quot;genealogy&quot; of the antiquated beliefs as well) is given &quot;...in terms of being or becoming as difference and repetition, together with genetic processes of individuation whereby beings come to exist and pass out of existence.&quot; 

Time and space, for both thinkers, is also constituted in nearly identical ways. Time-space in the &quot;Beiträge&quot; and the three syntheses in &quot;Difference and Repetition&quot; both apprehend time as grounded in difference, whilst the distinction between the time-space of the world [Welt] and the time-space as the eventual production of such a time-space is mirrored by Deleuze&#x27;s categorization between the temporality of what is actual and temporality of the virtual in the first and the second/third syntheses respectively. 

Another parallel can be found in their utilization of so-called &quot;generative paradoxes,&quot; or rather problems whose fundamental problematic element is constantly outside the categorical grasp fond of formal, natural, and human sciences. For Heidegger, this is the Earth in the fourfold, something which has as one of its traits the behaviour of &quot;resisting articulation,&quot; what he characterizes as a &quot;strife&quot;; for Deleuze, a similar example can be spotted in the paradox of regress, or of indefinite proliferation in the &quot;Logic of Sense&quot;.

== Reception ==
In the 1960s, Deleuze&#x27;s portrayal of Nietzsche as a metaphysician of difference rather than a reactionary mystic contributed greatly to the plausibility and popularity of &quot;left-wing Nietzscheanism&quot; as an intellectual stance. His books &quot;Difference and Repetition&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Logic of Sense&quot; (1969) led Michel Foucault to declare that &quot;one day, perhaps, this century will be called Deleuzian.&quot; (Deleuze, for his part, said Foucault&#x27;s comment was &quot;a joke meant to make people who like us laugh, and make everyone else livid.&quot;) In the 1970s, the &quot;Anti-Oedipus&quot;, written in a style by turns vulgar and esoteric, offering a sweeping analysis of the family, language, capitalism, and history via eclectic borrowings from primarily Marx, Freud, Lacan, and Nietzsche, but also featuring insights from dozens of other writers, was received as a theoretical embodiment of the anarchic spirit of May 1968. In 1994 and 1995, &quot;L&#x27;Abécédaire de Gilles Deleuze&quot;, an eight-hour series of interviews between Deleuze and Claire Parnet, aired on France&#x27;s Arte Channel.

In the 1980s and 1990s, almost all of Deleuze&#x27;s books were translated into English. Deleuze&#x27;s work is frequently cited in English-speaking academia (in 2007, e.g., he was the 11th most frequently cited author in English-speaking publications in the humanities, between Freud and Kant). In the English-speaking academy, Deleuze&#x27;s work is typically classified as continental philosophy.

However, some French and some Anglophone philosophers criticised Deleuze&#x27;s work.

According to Pascal Engel, Deleuze&#x27;s metaphilosophical approach makes it impossible to reasonably disagree with a philosophical system, and so destroys meaning, truth, and philosophy itself. Engel summarizes Deleuze&#x27;s metaphilosophy thus: &quot;When faced with a beautiful philosophical concept you should just sit back and admire it. You should not question it.&quot;

American philosopher Stanley Rosen objects to Deleuze&#x27;s interpretation of Nietzsche&#x27;s eternal return.

Vincent Descombes argues that Deleuze&#x27;s account of a difference that is not derived from identity (in &quot;Nietzsche and Philosophy&quot;) is incoherent.

Slavoj Žižek states that the Deleuze of &quot;Anti-Oedipus&quot; (&quot;arguably Deleuze&#x27;s worst book&quot;), the &quot;political&quot; Deleuze under the &quot;&#x27;bad&#x27; influence&quot; of Guattari, ends up, despite protestations to the contrary, as &quot;the ideologist of late capitalism&quot;.

=== Allegations of idealism and negligence of material conditions ===
Peter Hallward argues that Deleuze&#x27;s insistence that being is necessarily creative and always-differentiating entails that his philosophy can offer no insight into, and is supremely indifferent to, the material conditions of existence. Thus Hallward claims that Deleuze&#x27;s thought is literally other-worldly, aiming only at a passive contemplation of the dissolution of all identity into the theophanic self-creation of nature.

Descombes argues that his analysis of history in &quot;Anti-Oedipus&quot; is &#x27;utter idealism&#x27;, criticizing reality for falling short of a non-existent ideal of schizophrenic becoming. 

Žižek claims that Deleuze&#x27;s ontology oscillates between materialism and idealism.

=== Relation with monism ===
Alain Badiou claims that Deleuze&#x27;s metaphysics only apparently embraces plurality and diversity, remaining at bottom monist. Badiou further argues that, in practical matters, Deleuze&#x27;s monism entails an ascetic, aristocratic fatalism akin to ancient Stoicism.

American philosopher Todd May argues that Deleuze&#x27;s claim that difference is ontologically primary ultimately contradicts his embrace of immanence, i.e., his monism. However, May believes that Deleuze can discard the primacy-of-difference thesis, and accept a Wittgensteinian holism without significantly altering his practical philosophy.

It has more recently been argued by the Swedish philosopher that Deleuze&#x27;s criticism of the history of philosophy as the metaphysical priority of identity over difference is a false distinction, and that Deleuze inadvertently reaches conclusions akin to such idealist philosophers of identity as Schelling.

=== Subjectivity and individuality ===
Other European philosophers have criticized Deleuze&#x27;s theory of subjectivity. For example, Manfred Frank claims that Deleuze&#x27;s theory of individuation as a process of bottomless differentiation fails to explain the unity of consciousness. 

Žižek also calls Deleuze to task for allegedly reducing the subject to &quot;just another&quot; substance and thereby failing to grasp the nothingness that, according to Lacan and Žižek, defines subjectivity. What remains worthwhile in Deleuze&#x27;s oeuvre, Žižek finds, are precisely Deleuze&#x27;s engagements with virtuality as the product of negativity.

=== Science wars ===

In &quot;Fashionable Nonsense&quot; (1997), physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont accuse Deleuze of abusing mathematical and scientific terms, particularly by sliding between accepted technical meanings and his own idiosyncratic use of those terms in his works. Sokal and Bricmont state that they don&#x27;t object to metaphorical reasoning, including with mathematical concepts, but mathematical and scientific terms are useful only insofar as they are precise. They give examples of mathematical concepts being &quot;abused&quot; by taking them out of their intended meaning, rendering the idea into normal language reduces it to truism or nonsense. In their opinion, Deleuze used mathematical concepts about which the typical reader might be not knowledgeable, and thus served to display erudition rather than enlightening the reader. Sokal and Bricmont state that they only deal with the &quot;abuse&quot; of mathematical and scientific concepts and explicitly suspend judgment about Deleuze&#x27;s wider contributions.

== Influence ==

Other scholars in continental philosophy, feminist studies and sexuality studies have taken Deleuze&#x27;s analysis of the sexual dynamics of sadism and masochism with a level of uncritical celebration following the 1989 Zone Books translation of the 1967 booklet on Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, &quot;Le froid et le cruel&quot; (Coldness and Cruelty). As sexuality historian Alison M. Moore notes, Deleuze&#x27;s own value placed on difference is poorly reflected in this booklet which fails to differentiate between Masoch&#x27;s own view of his desire and that imposed upon him by the pathologizing forms of psychiatric thought prevailing in the late nineteenth century which produced the concept of &#x27;masochism&#x27; (a term Masoch himself emphatically rejected).

Smith, Protevi and Voss note &quot;Sokal and Bricmont’s 1999 intimations&quot; underestimated Deleuze&#x27;s awareness of mathematics and pointed out several &quot;positive views of Deleuze’s use of mathematics as provocations for [...] his philosophical concepts&quot;, and that Deleuze&#x27;s epistemology and ontology can be &quot;brought together&quot; with dynamical systems theory, chaos theory, biology, and geography.

<text>A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity. The word is derived from the Greek &quot;&quot; (), literally &#x27;milky&#x27;, a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars, range in size from dwarfs with less than a thousand stars, to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy&#x27;s centre of mass. Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, with only a few per cent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae. Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies.

Galaxies are categorised according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. The Milky Way is an example of a spiral galaxy. It is estimated that there are between 200 billion () to 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe. Most galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 parsecs in diameter (approximately 3,000 to 300,000 light years) and are separated by distances in the order of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs). For comparison, the Milky Way has a diameter of at least 26,800 parsecs (87,400 ly) and is separated from the Andromeda Galaxy, its nearest large neighbour, by just over 750,000 parsecs (2.5 million ly).

The space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas (the intergalactic medium) with an average density of less than one atom per cubic metre. Most galaxies are gravitationally organised into groups, clusters and superclusters. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, which it dominates along with the Andromeda Galaxy. The group is part of the Virgo Supercluster. At the largest scale, these associations are generally arranged into sheets and filaments surrounded by immense voids. Both the Local Group and the Virgo Supercluster are contained in a much larger cosmic structure named Laniakea.
== Etymology ==
The word &quot;galaxy&quot; was borrowed via French and Medieval Latin from the Greek term for the Milky Way, &quot;&quot; () &#x27;milky (circle)&#x27;, named after its appearance as a milky band of light in the sky. In Greek mythology, Zeus places his son, born by a mortal woman, the infant Heracles, on Hera&#x27;s breast while she is asleep so the baby will drink her divine milk and thus become immortal. Hera wakes up while breastfeeding and then realises she is nursing an unknown baby: she pushes the baby away, some of her milk spills, and it produces the band of light known as the Milky Way.

In the astronomical literature, the capitalised word &quot;Galaxy&quot; is often used to refer to the Milky Way galaxy, to distinguish it from the other galaxies in the observable universe. The English term &quot;Milky Way&quot; can be traced back to a story by Geoffrey Chaucer :

Galaxies were initially discovered telescopically and were known as &quot;spiral nebulae&quot;. Most 18th- to 19th-century astronomers considered them as either unresolved star clusters or extragalactic nebulae, and were just thought of as a part of the Milky Way, but their true composition and natures remained a mystery. Observations using larger telescopes of a few nearby bright galaxies, like the Andromeda Galaxy, began resolving them into huge conglomerations of stars, but based simply on the apparent faintness and sheer population of stars, the true distances of these objects placed them well beyond the Milky Way. For this reason they were popularly called &quot;island universes&quot;, but this term quickly fell into disuse, as the word &quot;universe&quot; implied the entirety of existence. Instead, they became known simply as galaxies.

== Nomenclature ==
Millions of galaxies have been catalogued, but only a few have well-established names, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, the Whirlpool Galaxy, and the Sombrero Galaxy. Astronomers work with numbers from certain catalogues, such as the Messier catalogue, the NGC (New General Catalogue), the IC (Index Catalogue), the CGCG (Catalogue of Galaxies and of Clusters of Galaxies), the MCG (Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies), the UGC (Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies), and the PGC (Catalogue of Principal Galaxies, also known as LEDA). All the well-known galaxies appear in one or more of these catalogues but each time under a different number. For example, Messier 109 (or &quot;M109&quot;) is a spiral galaxy having the number 109 in the catalogue of Messier. It also has the designations NGC 3992, UGC 6937, CGCG 269–023, MCG +09-20-044, and PGC 37617 (or LEDA 37617), among others. Millions of fainter galaxies are known by their identifiers in sky surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

== Observation history ==

=== Milky Way ===
Greek philosopher Democritus (450–370 BCE) proposed that the bright band on the night sky known as the Milky Way might consist of distant stars.
Aristotle (384–322 BCE), however, believed the Milky Way was caused by &quot;the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars that were large, numerous and close together&quot; and that the &quot;ignition takes place in the upper part of the atmosphere, in the region of the World that is continuous with the heavenly motions.&quot; Neoplatonist philosopher Olympiodorus the Younger (–570 CE) was critical of this view, arguing that if the Milky Way was sublunary (situated between Earth and the Moon) it should appear different at different times and places on Earth, and that it should have parallax, which it did not. In his view, the Milky Way was celestial.

According to Mohani Mohamed, Arabian astronomer Ibn al-Haytham (965–1037) made the first attempt at observing and measuring the Milky Way&#x27;s parallax, and he thus &quot;determined that because the Milky Way had no parallax, it must be remote from the Earth, not belonging to the atmosphere.&quot; Persian astronomer al-Biruni (973–1048) proposed the Milky Way galaxy was &quot;a collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous stars.&quot; Andalusian astronomer Avempace ( 1138) proposed that it was composed of many stars that almost touched one another, and appeared to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction from sublunary material, citing his observation of the conjunction of Jupiter and Mars as evidence of this occurring when two objects were near. In the 14th century, Syrian-born Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya proposed the Milky Way galaxy was &quot;a myriad of tiny stars packed together in the sphere of the fixed stars.&quot;

Actual proof of the Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study it and discovered it was composed of a huge number of faint stars. In 1750, English astronomer Thomas Wright, in his &quot;An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe&quot;, correctly speculated that it might be a rotating body of a huge number of stars held together by gravitational forces, akin to the Solar System but on a much larger scale, and that the resulting disk of stars could be seen as a band on the sky from a perspective inside it. In his 1755 treatise, Immanuel Kant elaborated on Wright&#x27;s idea about the Milky Way&#x27;s structure. 

The first project to describe the shape of the Milky Way and the position of the Sun was undertaken by William Herschel in 1785 by counting the number of stars in different regions of the sky. He produced a diagram of the shape of the galaxy with the Solar System close to the center. Using a refined approach, Kapteyn in 1920 arrived at the picture of a small (diameter about 15 kiloparsecs) ellipsoid galaxy with the Sun close to the center. A different method by Harlow Shapley based on the cataloguing of globular clusters led to a radically different picture: a flat disk with diameter approximately 70 kiloparsecs and the Sun far from the centre. Both analyses failed to take into account the absorption of light by interstellar dust present in the galactic plane; but after Robert Julius Trumpler quantified this effect in 1930 by studying open clusters, the present picture of the Milky Way galaxy emerged.

=== Distinction from other nebulae ===
A few galaxies outside the Milky Way are visible on a dark night to the unaided eye, including the Andromeda Galaxy, Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud, and the Triangulum Galaxy. In the 10th century, Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi made the earliest recorded identification of the Andromeda Galaxy, describing it as a &quot;small cloud&quot;. In 964, he probably mentioned the Large Magellanic Cloud in his &quot;Book of Fixed Stars&quot;, referring to &quot;Al Bakr of the southern Arabs&quot;, since at a declination of about 70° south it was not visible where he lived. It was not well known to Europeans until Magellan&#x27;s voyage in the 16th century. The Andromeda Galaxy was later independently noted by Simon Marius in 1612.

In 1734, philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg in his &quot;Principia&quot; speculated that there might be other galaxies outside that were formed into galactic clusters that were minuscule parts of the universe that extended far beyond what could be seen. These views &quot;are remarkably close to the present-day views of the cosmos.&quot;
In 1745, Pierre Louis Maupertuis conjectured that some nebula-like objects were collections of stars with unique properties, including a glow exceeding the light its stars produced on their own, and repeated Johannes Hevelius&#x27;s view that the bright spots were massive and flattened due to their rotation.
In 1750, Thomas Wright correctly speculated that the Milky Way was a flattened disk of stars, and that some of the nebulae visible in the night sky might be separate Milky Ways.
Toward the end of the 18th century, Charles Messier compiled a catalog containing the 109 brightest celestial objects having nebulous appearance. Subsequently, William Herschel assembled a catalog of 5,000 nebulae. In 1845, Lord Rosse examined the nebulae catalogued by Herschel and observed the spiral structure of Messier object M51, now known as the Whirlpool Galaxy.

In 1912, Vesto M. Slipher made spectrographic studies of the brightest spiral nebulae to determine their composition. Slipher discovered that the spiral nebulae have high Doppler shifts, indicating that they are moving at a rate exceeding the velocity of the stars he had measured. He found that the majority of these nebulae are moving away from us.

In 1917, Heber Doust Curtis observed nova S Andromedae within the &quot;Great Andromeda Nebula&quot;, as the Andromeda Galaxy, Messier object M31, was then known. Searching the photographic record, he found 11 more novae. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than those that occurred within this galaxy. As a result, he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 150,000 parsecs. He became a proponent of the so-called &quot;island universes&quot; hypothesis, which holds that spiral nebulae are actually independent galaxies.

In 1920 a debate took place between Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, the Great Debate, concerning the nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula is an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in the Milky Way, as well as the significant Doppler shift.

In 1922, the Estonian astronomer Ernst Öpik gave a distance determination that supported the theory that the Andromeda Nebula is indeed a distant extra-galactic object. Using the new 100-inch Mt. Wilson telescope, Edwin Hubble was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some Cepheid variables, thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the nebulae: they were far too distant to be part of the Milky Way. In 1926 Hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology that is used to this day.

=== Multi-wavelength observation ===
Advances in astronomy have always been driven by technology. After centuries of success in optical astronomy, recent decades have seen major progress in other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

The dust present in the interstellar medium is opaque to visual light. It is more transparent to far-infrared, which can be used to observe the interior regions of giant molecular clouds and galactic cores in great detail. Infrared is also used to observe distant, red-shifted galaxies that were formed much earlier. Water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb a number of useful portions of the infrared spectrum, so high-altitude or space-based telescopes are used for infrared astronomy.

The first non-visual study of galaxies, particularly active galaxies, was made using radio frequencies. The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is nearly transparent to radio between 5 MHz and 30 GHz. The ionosphere blocks signals below this range. Large radio interferometers have been used to map the active jets emitted from active nuclei.

Ultraviolet and X-ray telescopes can observe highly energetic galactic phenomena. Ultraviolet flares are sometimes observed when a star in a distant galaxy is torn apart from the tidal forces of a nearby black hole. The distribution of hot gas in galactic clusters can be mapped by X-rays. The existence of supermassive black holes at the cores of galaxies was confirmed through X-ray astronomy.

=== Modern research ===

In 1944, Hendrik van de Hulst predicted that microwave radiation with wavelength of 21 cm would be detectable from interstellar atomic hydrogen gas; and in 1951 it was observed. This radiation is not affected by dust absorption, and so its Doppler shift can be used to map the motion of the gas in this galaxy. These observations led to the hypothesis of a rotating bar structure in the center of this galaxy. With improved radio telescopes, hydrogen gas could also be traced in other galaxies.
In the 1970s, Vera Rubin uncovered a discrepancy between observed galactic rotation speed and that predicted by the visible mass of stars and gas. Today, the galaxy rotation problem is thought to be explained by the presence of large quantities of unseen dark matter.

Beginning in the 1990s, the Hubble Space Telescope yielded improved observations. Among other things, its data helped establish that the missing dark matter in this galaxy could not consist solely of inherently faint and small stars. The Hubble Deep Field, an extremely long exposure of a relatively empty part of the sky, provided evidence that there are about 125 billion () galaxies in the observable universe. Improved technology in detecting the spectra invisible to humans (radio telescopes, infrared cameras, and x-ray telescopes) allows detection of other galaxies that are not detected by Hubble. Particularly, surveys in the Zone of Avoidance (the region of sky blocked at visible-light wavelengths by the Milky Way) have revealed a number of new galaxies.

A 2016 study published in &quot;The Astrophysical Journal,&quot; led by Christopher Conselice of the University of Nottingham, used 20 years of Hubble images to estimate that the observable universe contained at least two trillion () galaxies. However, later observations with the New Horizons space probe from outside the zodiacal light reduced this to roughly 200 billion ().

== Types and morphology ==

Galaxies come in three main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. A slightly more extensive description of galaxy types based on their appearance is given by the Hubble sequence. Since the Hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual morphological type (shape), it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as star formation rate in starburst galaxies and activity in the cores of active galaxies.

Many galaxies are thought to contain a supermassive black hole at their center. This includes the Milky Way, whose core region is called the Galactic Center.

=== Ellipticals ===
The Hubble classification system rates elliptical galaxies on the basis of their ellipticity, ranging from E0, being nearly spherical, up to E7, which is highly elongated. These galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar matter. Consequently, these galaxies also have a low portion of open clusters and a reduced rate of new star formation. Instead, they are dominated by generally older, more evolved stars that are orbiting the common center of gravity in random directions. The stars contain low abundances of heavy elements because star formation ceases after the initial burst. In this sense they have some similarity to the much smaller globular clusters.

====Type-cD galaxies====

The largest galaxies are the type-cD galaxies.
First described in 1964 by a paper by Thomas A. Matthews and others, they are a subtype of the more general class of D galaxies, which are giant elliptical galaxies, except that they are much larger. They are popularly known as the supergiant elliptical galaxies and constitute the largest and most luminous galaxies known. These galaxies feature a central elliptical nucleus with an extensive, faint halo of stars extending to megaparsec scales. The profile of their surface brightnesses as a function of their radius (or distance from their cores) falls off more slowly than their smaller counterparts.

The formation of these cD galaxies remains an active area of research, but the leading model is that they are the result of the mergers of smaller galaxies in the environments of dense clusters, or even those outside of clusters with random overdensities. These processes are the mechanisms that drive the formation of fossil groups or fossil clusters, where a large, relatively isolated, supergiant elliptical resides in the middle of the cluster and are surrounded by an extensive cloud of X-rays as the residue of these galactic collisions. Another older model posits the phenomenon of cooling flow, where the heated gases in clusters collapses towards their centers as they cool, forming stars in the process, a phenomenon observed in clusters such as Perseus, and more recently in the Phoenix Cluster.

==== Shell galaxy ====
A shell galaxy is a type of elliptical galaxy where the stars in its halo are arranged in concentric shells. About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. These structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy—that as the two galaxy centers approach, they start to oscillate around a center point, and the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water. For example, galaxy NGC 3923 has over 20 shells.

=== Spirals ===

Spiral galaxies resemble spiraling pinwheels. Though the stars and other visible material contained in such a galaxy lie mostly on a plane, the majority of mass in spiral galaxies exists in a roughly spherical halo of dark matter which extends beyond the visible component, as demonstrated by the universal rotation curve concept.

Spiral galaxies consist of a rotating disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as type &quot;S&quot;, followed by a letter (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, or &quot;c&quot;) which indicates the degree of tightness of the spiral arms and the size of the central bulge. An &quot;Sa&quot; galaxy has tightly wound, poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region. At the other extreme, an &quot;Sc&quot; galaxy has open, well-defined arms and a small core region. A galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a flocculent spiral galaxy; in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and well-defined spiral arms. The speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with the flatness of the disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges, while others are thin and dense.
In spiral galaxies, the spiral arms do have the shape of approximate logarithmic spirals, a pattern that can be theoretically shown to result from a disturbance in a uniformly rotating mass of stars. Like the stars, the spiral arms rotate around the center, but they do so with constant angular velocity. The spiral arms are thought to be areas of high-density matter, or &quot;density waves&quot;. As stars move through an arm, the space velocity of each stellar system is modified by the gravitational force of the higher density. (The velocity returns to normal after the stars depart on the other side of the arm.) This effect is akin to a &quot;wave&quot; of slowdowns moving along a highway full of moving cars. The arms are visible because the high density facilitates star formation, and therefore they harbor many bright and young stars.
==== Barred spiral galaxy ====
A majority of spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way galaxy, have a linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward to either side of the core, then merges into the spiral arm structure. In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an &quot;SB&quot;, followed by a lower-case letter (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; or &quot;c&quot;) which indicates the form of the spiral arms (in the same manner as the categorization of normal spiral galaxies). Bars are thought to be temporary structures that can occur as a result of a density wave radiating outward from the core, or else due to a tidal interaction with another galaxy. Many barred spiral galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.

Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is a large disk-shaped barred-spiral galaxy about 30 kiloparsecs in diameter and a kiloparsec thick. It contains about two hundred billion (2×1011) stars and has a total mass of about six hundred billion (6×1011) times the mass of the Sun.

==== Super-luminous spiral ====
Recently, researchers described galaxies called super-luminous spirals. They are very large with an upward diameter of 437,000 light-years (compared to the Milky Way&#x27;s 87,400 light-year diameter). With a mass of 340 billion solar masses, they generate a significant amount of ultraviolet and mid-infrared light. They are thought to have an increased star formation rate around 30 times faster than the Milky Way.

=== Other morphologies ===
* Peculiar galaxies are galactic formations that develop unusual properties due to tidal interactions with other galaxies.
** A ring galaxy has a ring-like structure of stars and interstellar medium surrounding a bare core. A ring galaxy is thought to occur when a smaller galaxy passes through the core of a spiral galaxy. Such an event may have affected the Andromeda Galaxy, as it displays a multi-ring-like structure when viewed in infrared radiation.
* A lenticular galaxy is an intermediate form that has properties of both elliptical and spiral galaxies. These are categorized as Hubble type S0, and they possess ill-defined spiral arms with an elliptical halo of stars (barred lenticular galaxies receive Hubble classification SB0).
* Irregular galaxies are galaxies that can not be readily classified into an elliptical or spiral morphology.
** An Irr-I galaxy has some structure but does not align cleanly with the Hubble classification scheme.
** Irr-II galaxies do not possess any structure that resembles a Hubble classification, and may have been disrupted. Nearby examples of (dwarf) irregular galaxies include the Magellanic Clouds.

* A dark or &quot;ultra diffuse&quot; galaxy is an extremely-low-luminosity galaxy. It may be the same size as the Milky Way, but have a visible star count only one percent of the Milky Way&#x27;s. Multiple mechanisms for producing this type of galaxy have been proposed, and it is possible that different dark galaxies formed by different means. One candidate explanation for the low luminosity is that the galaxy lost its star-forming gas at an early stage, resulting in old stellar populations.

=== Dwarfs ===
Despite the prominence of large elliptical and spiral galaxies, most galaxies are dwarf galaxies. They are relatively small when compared with other galactic formations, being about one hundredth the size of the Milky Way, with only a few billion stars. Blue compact dwarf galaxies contains large clusters of young, hot, massive stars. Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies have been discovered that are only 100 parsecs across.

Many dwarf galaxies may orbit a single larger galaxy; the Milky Way has at least a dozen such satellites, with an estimated 300–500 yet to be discovered.
Most of the information we have about dwarf galaxies come from observations of the local group, containing two spiral galaxies, the Milky Way and Andromeda, and many dwarf galaxies. These dwarf galaxies are classified as either irregular or dwarf elliptical/dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

A study of 27 Milky Way neighbors found that in all dwarf galaxies, the central mass is approximately 10 million solar masses, regardless of whether it has thousands or millions of stars. This suggests that galaxies are largely formed by dark matter, and that the minimum size may indicate a form of warm dark matter incapable of gravitational coalescence on a smaller scale.

== Variants ==
=== Interacting ===

Interactions between galaxies are relatively frequent, and they can play an important role in galactic evolution. Near misses between galaxies result in warping distortions due to tidal interactions, and may cause some exchange of gas and dust.
Collisions occur when two galaxies pass directly through each other and have sufficient relative momentum not to merge. The stars of interacting galaxies usually do not collide, but the gas and dust within the two forms interacts, sometimes triggering star formation. A collision can severely distort the galaxies&#x27; shapes, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.

At the extreme of interactions are galactic mergers, where the galaxies&#x27; relative momentums are insufficient to allow them to pass through each other. Instead, they gradually merge to form a single, larger galaxy. Mergers can result in significant changes to the galaxies&#x27; original morphology. If one of the galaxies is much more massive than the other, the result is known as cannibalism, where the more massive larger galaxy remains relatively undisturbed, and the smaller one is torn apart. The Milky Way galaxy is currently in the process of cannibalizing the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy and the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy.

=== Starburst ===

Stars are created within galaxies from a reserve of cold gas that forms giant molecular clouds. Some galaxies have been observed to form stars at an exceptional rate, which is known as a &quot;starburst&quot;. If they continue to do so, they would consume their reserve of gas in a time span less than the galaxy&#x27;s lifespan. Hence starburst activity usually lasts only about ten million years, a relatively brief period in a galaxy&#x27;s history. Starburst galaxies were more common during the universe&#x27;s early history, but still contribute an estimated 15% to total star production.

Starburst galaxies are characterized by dusty concentrations of gas and the appearance of newly formed stars, including massive stars that ionize the surrounding clouds to create H II regions. These stars produce supernova explosions, creating expanding remnants that interact powerfully with the surrounding gas. These outbursts trigger a chain reaction of star-building that spreads throughout the gaseous region. Only when the available gas is nearly consumed or dispersed does the activity end.

Starbursts are often associated with merging or interacting galaxies. The prototype example of such a starburst-forming interaction is M82, which experienced a close encounter with the larger M81. Irregular galaxies often exhibit spaced knots of starburst activity.

=== Radio galaxy ===
A radio galaxy is a galaxy with giant regions of radio emission extending well beyond its visible structure. These energetic radio lobes are powered by jets from its active galactic nucleus. Radio galaxies are classified according to their Fanaroff–Riley classification. The FR I class have lower radio luminosity and exhibit structures which are more elongated; the FR II class are higher radio luminosity. The correlation of radio luminosity and structure suggests that the sources in these two types of galaxies may differ.

Radio galaxies can also be classified as giant radio galaxies (GRGs), whose radio emissions can extend to scales of megaparsecs (3.26 million light-years). Alcyoneus is an FR II class low-excitation radio galaxy which has the largest observed radio emission, with lobed structures spanning 5 megaparsecs (16×106 ly). For comparison, another similarly sized giant radio galaxy is 3C 236, with lobes 15 million light-years across. It should however be noted that radio emissions are &quot;not&quot; always considered part of the main galaxy itself.

A giant radio galaxy is a special class of objects characterized by the presence of radio lobes generated by relativistic jets powered by the central galaxy&#x27;s supermassive black hole. Giant radio galaxies are different from ordinary radio galaxies in that they can extend to much larger scales, reaching upwards to several megaparsecs across, far larger than the diameters of their host galaxies.

A &quot;normal&quot; radio galaxy do not have a source that is a supermassive black hole or monster neutron star; instead the source is synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons accelerated by supernova. These sources are comparatively short lived, making the radio spectrum from normal radio galaxies an especially good way to study star formation.

=== Active galaxy ===

Some observable galaxies are classified as &quot;active&quot; if they contain an active galactic nucleus (AGN). A significant portion of the galaxy&#x27;s total energy output is emitted by the active nucleus instead of its stars, dust and interstellar medium. There are multiple classification and naming schemes for AGNs, but those in the lower ranges of luminosity are called Seyfert galaxies, while those with luminosities much greater than that of the host galaxy are known as quasi-stellar objects or quasars. Models of AGNs suggest that a significant fraction of their light is shifted to far-infrared frequencies because optical and UV emission in the nucleus is absorbed and remitted by dust and gas surrounding it.

The standard model for an active galactic nucleus is based on an accretion disc that forms around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the galaxy&#x27;s core region. The radiation from an active galactic nucleus results from the gravitational energy of matter as it falls toward the black hole from the disc. The AGN&#x27;s luminosity depends on the SMBH&#x27;s mass and the rate at which matter falls onto it.
In about 10% of these galaxies, a diametrically opposed pair of energetic jets ejects particles from the galaxy core at velocities close to the speed of light. The mechanism for producing these jets is not well understood.

==== Seyfert galaxy ====
Seyfert galaxies are one of the two largest groups of active galaxies, along with quasars. They have quasar-like nuclei (very luminous, distant and bright sources of electromagnetic radiation) with very high surface brightnesses; but unlike quasars, their host galaxies are clearly detectable. Seen through a telescope, a Seyfert galaxy appears like an ordinary galaxy with a bright star superimposed atop the core. Seyfert galaxies are divided into two principal subtypes based on the frequencies observed in their spectra.

==== Quasar ====
Quasars are the most energetic and distant members of active galactic nuclei. Extremely luminous, they were first identified as high redshift sources of electromagnetic energy, including radio waves and visible light, that appeared more similar to stars than to extended sources similar to galaxies. Their luminosity can be 100 times that of the Milky Way. The nearest known quasar, Markarian 231, is about 581 million light-years from Earth, while others have been discovered as far away as UHZ1, roughly 13.2 billion light-years distant. Quasars are noteworthy for providing the first demonstration of the phenomenon that gravity can act as a lens for light.

==== Other AGNs ====
Blazars are believed to be active galaxies with a relativistic jet pointed in the direction of Earth. A radio galaxy emits radio frequencies from relativistic jets. A unified model of these types of active galaxies explains their differences based on the observer&#x27;s position.

Possibly related to active galactic nuclei (as well as starburst regions) are low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). The emission from LINER-type galaxies is dominated by weakly ionized elements. The excitation sources for the weakly ionized lines include post-AGB stars, AGN, and shocks. Approximately one-third of nearby galaxies are classified as containing LINER nuclei.

=== Luminous infrared galaxy ===
Luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) are galaxies with luminosities—the measurement of electromagnetic power output—above 1011 L☉ (solar luminosities). In most cases, most of their energy comes from large numbers of young stars which heat surrounding dust, which reradiates the energy in the infrared. Luminosity high enough to be a LIRG requires a star formation rate of at least 18 M☉ yr−1. Ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) are at least ten times more luminous still and form stars at rates &gt;180 M☉ yr−1. Many LIRGs also emit radiation from an AGN. Infrared galaxies emit more energy in the infrared than all other wavelengths combined, with peak emission typically at wavelengths of 60 to 100 microns. LIRGs are believed to be created from the strong interaction and merger of spiral galaxies. While uncommon in the local universe, LIRGs and ULIRGS were more prevalent when the universe was younger.

==Physical diameters==

Galaxies do not have a definite boundary by their nature, and are characterized by a gradually decreasing stellar density as a function of increasing distance from their center, making measurements of their true extents difficult. Nevertheless, astronomers over the past few decades have made several criteria in defining the sizes of galaxies.

===Angular diameter===

As early as the time of Edwin Hubble in 1936, there have been attempts to characterize the diameters of galaxies. The earliest efforts were based on the observed angle subtended by the galaxy and its estimated distance, leading to an &quot;angular diameter&quot; (also called &quot;metric diameter&quot;).

===Isophotal diameter===

The &quot;isophotal diameter&quot; is introduced as a conventional way of measuring a galaxy&#x27;s size based on its apparent surface brightness. Isophotes are curves in a diagram - such as a picture of a galaxy - that adjoins points of equal brightnesses, and are useful in defining the extent of the galaxy. The apparent brightness flux of a galaxy is measured in units of magnitudes per square arcsecond (mag/arcsec2; sometimes expressed as &quot;mag arcsec−2&quot;), which defines the brightness depth of the isophote. To illustrate how this unit works, a typical galaxy has a brightness flux of 18 mag/arcsec2 at its central region. This brightness is equivalent to the light of an 18th magnitude hypothetical point object (like a star) being spread out evenly in a one square arcsecond area of the sky. The isophotal diameter is typically defined as the region enclosing all the light down to 25 mag/arcsec2 in the blue B-band, which is then referred to as the D25 standard.

===Effective radius (half-light) and its variations===
The half-light radius (also known as &quot;effective radius&quot;; R&quot;e&quot;) is a measure that is based on the galaxy&#x27;s overall brightness flux. This is the radius upon which half, or 50%, of the total brightness flux of the galaxy was emitted. This was first proposed by Gérard de Vaucouleurs in 1948. The choice of using 50% was arbitrary, but proved to be useful in further works by R. A. Fish in 1963, where he established a luminosity concentration law that relates the brightnesses of elliptical galaxies and their respective R&quot;e&quot;, and by José Luis Sérsic in 1968 that defined a mass-radius relation in galaxies.

In defining R&quot;e&quot;, it is necessary that the overall brightness flux galaxy should be captured, with a method employed by Bershady in 2000 suggesting to measure twice the size where the brightness flux of an arbitrarily chosen radius, defined as the local flux, divided by the overall average flux equals to 0.2. Using half-light radius allows a rough estimate of a galaxy&#x27;s size, but is not particularly helpful in determining its morphology.

Variations of this method exist. In particular, in the ESO-Uppsala Catalogue of Galaxies values of 50%, 70%, and 90% of the total blue light (the light detected through a B-band specific filter) had been used to calculate a galaxy&#x27;s diameter.

=== Petrosian magnitude ===
First described by Vahe Petrosian in 1976, a modified version of this method has been used by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This method employs a mathematical model on a galaxy whose radius is determined by the azimuthally (horizontal) averaged profile of its brightness flux. In particular, the SDSS employed the Petrosian magnitude in the R-band (658 nm, in the red part of the visible spectrum) to ensure that the brightness flux of a galaxy would be captured as much as possible while counteracting the effects of background noise. For a galaxy whose brightness profile is exponential, it is expected to capture all of its brightness flux, and 80% for galaxies that follow a profile that follows de Vaucouleurs&#x27;s law.

Petrosian magnitudes have the advantage of being redshift and distance independent, allowing the measurement of the galaxy&#x27;s apparent size since the Petrosian radius is defined in terms of the galaxy&#x27;s overall luminous flux.

A critique of an earlier version of this method has been issued by the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, with the method causing a magnitude of error (upwards to 10%) of the values than using isophotal diameter. The use of Petrosian magnitudes also have the disadvantage of missing most of the light outside the Petrosian aperture, which is defined relative to the galaxy&#x27;s overall brightness profile, especially for elliptical galaxies, with higher signal-to-noise ratios on higher distances and redshifts. A correction for this method has been issued by Graham &quot;et al.&quot; in 2005, based on the assumption that galaxies follow Sérsic&#x27;s law.

===Near-infrared method===
This method has been used by 2MASS as an adaptation from the previously used methods of isophotal measurement. Since 2MASS operates in the near infrared, which has the advantage of being able to recognize dimmer, cooler, and older stars, it has a different form of approach compared to other methods that normally use B-filter. The detail of the method used by 2MASS has been described thoroughly in a document by Jarrett &quot;et al.&quot;, with the survey measuring several parameters.

The standard aperture ellipse (area of detection) is defined by the infrared isophote at the Ks band (roughly 2.2 μm wavelength) of 20 mag/arcsec2. Gathering the overall luminous flux of the galaxy has been employed by at least four methods: the first being a circular aperture extending 7 arcseconds from the center, an isophote at 20 mag/arcsec2, a &quot;total&quot; aperture defined by the radial light distribution that covers the supposed extent of the galaxy, and the Kron aperture (defined as 2.5 times the first-moment radius, an integration of the flux of the &quot;total&quot; aperture).

== Larger-scale structures ==

Deep-sky surveys show that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not significantly interacted with other galaxies of comparable mass in the past few billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed are isolated in this sense. However, they may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller satellite galaxies.

On the largest scale, the universe is continually expanding, resulting in an average increase in the separation between individual galaxies (see Hubble&#x27;s law). Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction. These associations formed early, as clumps of dark matter pulled their respective galaxies together. Nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters. This ongoing merging process, as well as an influx of infalling gas, heats the intergalactic gas in a cluster to very high temperatures of 30–100 megakelvins. About 70–80% of a cluster&#x27;s mass is in the form of dark matter, with 10–30% consisting of this heated gas and the remaining few percent in the form of galaxies.

Most galaxies are gravitationally bound to a number of other galaxies. These form a fractal-like hierarchical distribution of clustered structures, with the smallest such associations being termed groups. A group of galaxies is the most common type of galactic cluster; these formations contain the majority of galaxies (as well as most of the baryonic mass) in the universe. To remain gravitationally bound to such a group, each member galaxy must have a sufficiently low velocity to prevent it from escaping (see Virial theorem). If there is insufficient kinetic energy, however, the group may evolve into a smaller number of galaxies through mergers.
Clusters of galaxies consist of hundreds to thousands of galaxies bound together by gravity. Clusters of galaxies are often dominated by a single giant elliptical galaxy, known as the brightest cluster galaxy, which, over time, tidally destroys its satellite galaxies and adds their mass to its own.

Superclusters contain tens of thousands of galaxies, which are found in clusters, groups and sometimes individually. At the supercluster scale, galaxies are arranged into sheets and filaments surrounding vast empty voids. Above this scale, the universe appears to be the same in all directions (isotropic and ), though this notion has been challenged in recent years by numerous findings of large-scale structures that appear to be exceeding this scale. The Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall, currently the largest structure in the universe found so far, is 10 billion light-years (three gigaparsecs) in length.

The Milky Way galaxy is a member of an association named the Local Group, a relatively small group of galaxies that has a diameter of approximately one megaparsec. The Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are the two brightest galaxies within the group; many of the other member galaxies are dwarf companions of these two. The Local Group itself is a part of a cloud-like structure within the Virgo Supercluster, a large, extended structure of groups and clusters of galaxies centered on the Virgo Cluster. In turn, the Virgo Supercluster is a portion of the Laniakea Supercluster.

==Magnetic fields==
Galaxies have magnetic fields of their own. A galaxy&#x27;s magnetic field influences its dynamics in multiple ways, including affecting the formation of spiral arms and transporting angular momentum in gas clouds. The latter effect is particularly important, as it is a necessary factor for the gravitational collapse of those clouds, and thus for star formation.

The typical average equipartition strength for spiral galaxies is about 10 μG (microgauss) or 1nT (nanotesla). By comparison, the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field has an average strength of about 0.3 G (Gauss) or 30 μT (microtesla). Radio-faint galaxies like M 31 and M33, the Milky Way&#x27;s neighbors, have weaker fields (about 5μG), while gas-rich galaxies with high star-formation rates, like M 51, M 83 and NGC 6946, have 15 μG on average. In prominent spiral arms, the field strength can be up to 25 μG, in regions where cold gas and dust are also concentrated. The strongest total equipartition fields (50–100 μG) were found in starburst galaxies—for example, in M 82 and the Antennae; and in nuclear starburst regions, such as the centers of NGC 1097 and other barred galaxies.

== Formation and evolution ==
=== Formation ===
Current models of the formation of galaxies in the early universe are based on the ΛCDM model. About 300,000 years after the Big Bang, atoms of hydrogen and helium began to form, in an event called recombination. Nearly all the hydrogen was neutral (non-ionized) and readily absorbed light, and no stars had yet formed. As a result, this period has been called the &quot;dark ages&quot;. It was from density fluctuations (or anisotropic irregularities) in this primordial matter that larger structures began to appear. As a result, masses of baryonic matter started to condense within cold dark matter halos. These primordial structures allowed gasses to condense in to protogalaxies, large scale gas clouds that were precursors to the first galaxies.

As gas falls in to the gravity of the dark matter halos, its pressure and temperature rise. To condense further, the gas must radiate energy. This process was slow in the early universe dominated by hydrogen atoms and molecules which are inefficient radiators compared to heavier elements. As clumps of gas aggregate forming rotating disks, temperatures and pressures continue to increase. Some places within the disk reach high enough density to form stars.

Once protogalaxies began to form and contract, the first halo stars, called Population III stars, appeared within them. These were composed of primordial gas, almost entirely of hydrogen and helium.
Emission from the first stars heats the remaining gas helping to trigger additional star formation; the ultraviolet light emission from the first generation of stars re-ionized the surrounding neutral hydrogen in expanding spheres eventually reaching the entire universe, an event called reionization. The most massive stars collapse in violent supernova explosions releasing heavy elements (&quot;metals&quot;) into the interstellar medium. This metal content is incorporated into population II stars.

Theoretical models for early galaxy formation have been verified and informed by a large number and variety of sophisticated astronomical observations. The photometric observations generally need spectroscopic confirmation due the large number mechanisms that can introduce systematic errors. For example, a high redshift (z ~ 16) photometric observation by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) was later corrected to be closer to z ~ 5.
Nevertheless, confirmed observations from the JWST and other observatories are accumulating, allowing systematic comparison of early galaxies to predictions of theory.

Evidence for individual Population III stars in early galaxies is even more challenging. Even seemingly confirmed spectroscopic evidence may turn out to have other origins. For example, astronomers reported HeII emission evidence for Population III stars in the Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy, with a redshift value of 6.60. Subsequent observations found metallic emission lines, OIII, inconsistent with an early-galaxy star.

=== Evolution ===
Once stars begin to form, emit radiation, and in some cases explode, the process of galaxy formation becomes very complex, involving interactions between the forces of gravity, radiation, and thermal energy. Many details are still poorly understood.

Within a billion years of a galaxy&#x27;s formation, key structures begin to appear. Globular clusters, the central supermassive black hole, and a galactic bulge of metal-poor Population II stars form. The creation of a supermassive black hole appears to play a key role in actively regulating the growth of galaxies by limiting the total amount of additional matter added. During this early epoch, galaxies undergo a major burst of star formation.

During the following two billion years, the accumulated matter settles into a galactic disc. A galaxy will continue to absorb infalling material from high-velocity clouds and dwarf galaxies throughout its life. This matter is mostly hydrogen and helium. The cycle of stellar birth and death slowly increases the abundance of heavy elements, eventually allowing the formation of planets.
Star formation rates in galaxies depend upon their local environment. Isolated &#x27;void&#x27; galaxies have highest rate per stellar mass, with &#x27;field&#x27; galaxies associated with spiral galaxies having lower rates and galaxies in dense cluster having the lowest rates.

The evolution of galaxies can be significantly affected by interactions and collisions. Mergers of galaxies were common during the early epoch, and the majority of galaxies were peculiar in morphology. Given the distances between the stars, the great majority of stellar systems in colliding galaxies will be unaffected. However, gravitational stripping of the interstellar gas and dust that makes up the spiral arms produces a long train of stars known as tidal tails. Examples of these formations can be seen in NGC 4676 or the Antennae Galaxies.

The Milky Way galaxy and the nearby Andromeda Galaxy are moving toward each other at about 130 km/s, and—depending upon the lateral movements—the two might collide in about five to six billion years. Although the Milky Way has never collided with a galaxy as large as Andromeda before, it has collided and merged with other galaxies in the past. Cosmological simulations indicate that, 11 billion years ago, it merged with a particularly large galaxy that has been labeled the Kraken.

Such large-scale interactions are rare. As time passes, mergers of two systems of equal size become less common. Most bright galaxies have remained fundamentally unchanged for the last few billion years, and the net rate of star formation probably also peaked about ten billion years ago.

=== Future trends ===
Spiral galaxies, like the Milky Way, produce new generations of stars as long as they have dense molecular clouds of interstellar hydrogen in their spiral arms. Elliptical galaxies are largely devoid of this gas, and so form few new stars. The supply of star-forming material is finite; once stars have converted the available supply of hydrogen into heavier elements, new star formation will come to an end.

The current era of star formation is expected to continue for up to one hundred billion years, and then the &quot;stellar age&quot; will wind down after about ten trillion to one hundred trillion years (1013–1014 years), as the smallest, longest-lived stars in the visible universe, tiny red dwarfs, begin to fade. At the end of the stellar age, galaxies will be composed of compact objects: brown dwarfs, white dwarfs that are cooling or cold (&quot;black dwarfs&quot;), neutron stars, and black holes. Eventually, as a result of gravitational relaxation, all stars will either fall into central supermassive black holes or be flung into intergalactic space as a result of collisions.

<text>Eugene Allen Hackman (January 30, 1930 February 17, 2025) was an American actor. In a career that spanned over four decades, he received two Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards.

Hackman&#x27;s two Academy Award wins were for Best Actor for his role as Jimmy &quot;Popeye&quot; Doyle in William Friedkin&#x27;s action thriller &quot;The French Connection&quot; (1971) and for Best Supporting Actor for his role as a villainous Sheriff in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s Western film &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (1992). He was also Oscar-nominated for three other roles: that of Buck Barrow in the crime drama &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967); a college professor in the drama &quot;I Never Sang for My Father&quot; (1970); and an FBI agent in the historical drama &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; (1988).

Hackman gained further fame for his portrayal of Lex Luthor in three of the &quot;Superman&quot; films from 1978 to 1987. He also acted in: &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972), &quot;Scarecrow&quot; (1973), &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974), &quot;Night Moves&quot; (1975), &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977), &quot;Under Fire&quot; (1983), &quot;Hoosiers&quot; (1986), &quot;Power&quot; (1986), &quot;Another Woman&quot; (1988), &quot;The Firm&quot; (1993), &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; (1995), &quot;Get Shorty&quot; (1995), &quot;The Birdcage&quot; (1996), &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; (1998), &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; (2001) and &quot;Runaway Jury&quot; (2003). He mostly retired from acting after his final film role in &quot;Welcome to Mooseport&quot; (2004), occasionally providing narration for television documentaries until 2017.

==Early life and military service==
Eugene Allen Hackman was born on January 30, 1930, in San Bernardino, California, to Anna Lyda Elizabeth () and Eugene Ezra Hackman. He had a brother named Richard. His mother was born in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. Hackman&#x27;s family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. His father operated the printing press for the &quot;Commercial-News&quot;, a local newspaper. Hackman said he had decided at age ten that he wanted to become an actor. His parents divorced when he was 13, and his father later left the family.

Hackman spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School. He left home at age 16, lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps, and served four and a half years as a field-radio operator. Hackman was stationed in China (Qingdao and later in Shanghai). When Communist revolutionaries conquered the mainland in 1949, he was reassigned to Hawaii and Japan. After his discharge in 1951, Hackman moved to New York City, where he worked at various jobs. In 1962, his mother died in a fire she had accidentally started while smoking. He began a study of journalism and television production at the University of Illinois under the G.I. Bill, but left without graduating and moved back to California.

==Career==
===1956–1969: Career beginnings ===

In 1956, Hackman began pursuing an acting career. He joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California, where he befriended another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, Hackman and Hoffman were voted &quot;the least likely to succeed&quot;, and Hackman got the lowest score the Pasadena Playhouse had yet given. Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; described Hackman, Hoffman, and Robert Duvall as struggling California-born actors and close friends, sharing New York apartments in various two-person combinations in the 1960s. 

To support himself between acting jobs, Hackman was working at a Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant when he encountered an instructor from the Pasadena Playhouse, who said that his job proved that Hackman &quot;wouldn&#x27;t amount to anything&quot;. A Marine officer who saw him as a doorman said &quot;Hackman, you&#x27;re a sorry son of a bitch.&quot; Rejection motivated Hackman, who said:

Hackman got various bit roles, for example in the film &quot;Mad Dog Coll&quot; and on multiple television series, &quot;Tallahassee 7000&quot;, &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, &quot;The DuPont Show of the Week&quot;, &quot;East Side/West Side&quot;, and &quot;Brenner&quot;. Hackman began performing in several Off-Broadway plays, starting with &quot;The Saintliness of Margery Kempe&quot; in 1959 and including &quot;Come to the Palace of Sin&quot; in 1963. In 1963 he made his Broadway debut in &quot;Children From Their Games&quot; which had only a short run, as did &quot;A Rainy Day in Newark&quot;. However, &quot;Any Wednesday&quot; with actress Sandy Dennis was a huge Broadway success in 1964. This opened the door to film work. His first credited role was in &quot;Lilith&quot;, with Jean Seberg and Warren Beatty in the leading roles.
Hackman returned to Broadway in &quot;Poor Richard&quot; (1964–65) by Jean Kerr, which ran for over a hundred performances. He continued to do television – &quot;The Trials of O&#x27;Brien&quot;, &quot;Hawk&quot;, &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; – and had a small part as Dr. John Whipple in the epic film &quot;Hawaii.&quot; He had small roles in features like &quot;First to Fight&quot; (1967), &quot;A Covenant with Death&quot; (1967), and &quot;Banning&quot; (1967). Hackman was originally cast as Mr. Robinson in the 1967 Mike Nichols film &quot;The Graduate&quot;, but Nichols fired him three weeks into rehearsal for being &quot;too young&quot; for the role; he was replaced by Murray Hamilton. Also in 1967 he appeared in an episode of the television series &quot;The Invaders&quot; entitled &quot;The Spores&quot;; and as Buck Barrow in 1967&#x27;s &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

A return to Broadway that same year, &quot;The Natural Look&quot;, ran for just one performance. Additionally he performed Off-Broadway in &quot;Fragments and The Basement&quot;. Hackman was in episodes of &quot;Iron Horse&quot; (&quot;Leopards Try, But Leopards Can&#x27;t&quot;) and &quot;Insight&quot; (&quot;Confrontation&quot;). In 1968, he appeared in an episode of &quot;I Spy&quot;, in the role of &quot;Hunter&quot;, in the episode &quot;Happy Birthday... Everybody&quot;. That same year he starred in the &quot;CBS Playhouse&quot; episode &quot;My Father and My Mother&quot; and the dystopian television film &quot;Shadow on the Land&quot;.

In 1969, he played a ski coach in &quot;Downhill Racer&quot; and an astronaut in &quot;Marooned&quot;. Also that year, he played a member of a barnstorming skydiving team that entertained mostly at county fairs, a film which also inspired many to pursue skydiving and has a cult-like status amongst skydivers as a result: &quot;The Gypsy Moths&quot;. Hackman supported Jim Brown in two films, &quot;The Split&quot; (1968) and &quot;Riot&quot; (1969), Hackman nearly accepted the role of Mike Brady for the TV series &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, but his agent advised that he decline it in exchange for a more promising role, which he did, but this story is said to have been exaggerated.

===1970–1979: Breakthrough and stardom ===

Hackman was nominated for a second Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his role in &quot;I Never Sang for My Father&quot; (1970). He starred in &quot;Doctors&#x27; Wives&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; (1971) then won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as New York City Detective Jimmy &quot;Popeye&quot; Doyle in &quot;The French Connection&quot; (1971), marking his graduation to stardom.

After &quot;The French Connection&quot;, Hackman starred in ten films (not including his cameo in &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;) over the next three years, making him the most prolific actor in Hollywood during that time frame. He followed &quot;The French Connection&quot; with leading roles in &quot;Cisco Pike&quot; (1972), &quot;Prime Cut&quot; (1972), &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972), &quot;Scarecrow&quot; (1973) alongside Al Pacino, which was Hackman&#x27;s favorite role of his career and won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974), which was nominated for several Oscars and also won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes. That same year, Hackman appeared in what would become one of his most famous comedic roles, as Harold the Blind Man in &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;. Hackman also appeared in &quot;Zandy&#x27;s Bride&quot; (1974) and &quot;Night Moves&quot; (1975) for director Arthur Penn.

Hackman played one of Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s former Rough Riders in the Western horse-race saga &quot;Bite the Bullet&quot; (1975). He reprised his Oscar-winning role as Doyle in the sequel &quot;French Connection II&quot; (1975), and co-starred with Burt Reynolds and Liza Minnelli in &quot;Lucky Lady&quot; (1975), a notorious flop. After making &quot;The Domino Principle&quot; (1977) for Stanley Kramer, Hackman was part of an all-star cast in the war film &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977), playing Polish General Stanisław Sosabowski, and was an officer in the French Foreign Legion in &quot;March or Die&quot; (1977).

Hackman showed a talent for both comedy and the &quot;slow burn&quot; as criminal mastermind Lex Luthor in &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; (1978), a role he would reprise in its 1980 and 1987 sequels.

===1980–1999: Established career and acclaim ===
Hackman alternated between leading and supporting roles during the 1980s. He appeared opposite Barbra Streisand in &quot;All Night Long&quot; (1981) and supported Warren Beatty in &quot;Reds&quot; (1981). He played the lead in &quot;Eureka&quot; (1983) and a supporting role in &quot;Under Fire&quot; (1983). Hackman provided the voice of God in &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; (1983) and starred in &quot;Uncommon Valor&quot; (1983), &quot;Misunderstood&quot; (1984), &quot;Twice in a Lifetime&quot; (1985), &quot;Target&quot; (1985) for Arthur Penn, and &quot;Power&quot; (1986). Between 1985 and 1988, he starred in nine films, making him the busiest actor, alongside Steve Guttenberg. Hackman played a high school basketball coach in &quot;Hoosiers&quot; (1986), which a 2008 American Film Institute poll named the fourth-greatest sports film of all time. After &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; (1987), he also voiced Nuclear Man (who was portrayed by Mark Pillow), and was in &quot;No Way Out&quot; (1987), &quot;Split Decisions&quot; (1988), &quot;Bat*21&quot; (1988), and &quot;Full Moon in Blue Water&quot; (1988). 

He acted opposite Gena Rowlands in the Woody Allen drama &quot;Another Woman&quot; (1988). Hackman starred in the Alan Parker directed crime drama &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; (1988) where he acted opposite Willem Dafoe where they played an FBI agents investigating a murder of a civil rights leader. He earned acclaim for the role with Roger Ebert praising his performance for his &quot;subtlety&quot;. He was nominated for a second Academy Award for Best Actor losing to Dustin Hoffman for &quot;Rain Man&quot;. After this he appeared in &quot;The Package&quot; (1989). Hackman starred in &quot;Loose Cannons&quot; (1990) with Dan Aykroyd, and he had a supporting role in &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot; (1990). He appeared with Anne Archer in &quot;Narrow Margin&quot; (1990), a remake of the 1952 film &quot;The Narrow Margin&quot;. After &quot;Class Action&quot; (1991) and &quot;Company Business&quot; (1991) Hackman played the sadistic sheriff &quot;Little Bill&quot; Daggett in the Western &quot;Unforgiven&quot; directed by Clint Eastwood and written by David Webb Peoples. Hackman had pledged to avoid violent roles, but Eastwood convinced him to take the part, which earned him a second Oscar, this time for Best Supporting Actor. The film also won Best Picture. 

Hackman returned to Broadway starring in the 1992 Ariel Dorfman play &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; acting opposite Glenn Close and Richard Dreyfus at the Brooks Atkinson Theater. In 1993, he appeared in &quot;&quot; as Brigadier General George Crook, and co-starred with Tom Cruise as a corrupt lawyer in &quot;The Firm&quot;, a legal thriller based on the John Grisham novel of the same name. Hackman would appear in two other films based on John Grisham novels, playing convict Sam Cayhall on death row in &quot;The Chamber&quot; (1996), and jury consultant Rankin Fitch in &quot;Runaway Jury&quot; (2003). Other notable films Hackman appeared in during the 1990s include &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; (1994) (as Nicholas Porter Earp, &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;″s father), &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; (1995) opposite Sharon Stone, Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, and as submarine Captain Frank Ramsey alongside Denzel Washington in &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; (1995).

Hackman played film producer Harry Zimm with John Travolta in the comedy-drama &quot;Get Shorty&quot; (1995). In 1996, he took a comedic turn as conservative Senator Kevin Keeley in &quot;The Birdcage&quot; with Robin Williams and Nathan Lane. He co-starred with Hugh Grant in &quot;Extreme Measures&quot; (1996) and reunited with Clint Eastwood in &quot;Absolute Power&quot; (1997). Hackman did &quot;Twilight&quot; (1998) with Paul Newman for director Robert Benton, did one of the voices for &quot;Antz&quot; (1998), and co-starred with Will Smith in &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; (1998), his character reminiscent of the one he had portrayed in &quot;The Conversation&quot;.

===2000–2004: Final films and retirement ===

Hackman co-starred with Morgan Freeman in &quot;Under Suspicion&quot; (2000), Keanu Reeves in &quot;The Replacements&quot; (2000), Owen Wilson in &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; (2001), Sigourney Weaver in &quot;Heartbreakers&quot; (2001), and appeared in the David Mamet crime thriller &quot;Heist&quot; (2001), as an aging professional thief of considerable skill who is forced into one final job. He made a cameo in &quot;The Mexican&quot; (2001). Hackman gained much critical acclaim playing against type as the head of an eccentric family in Wes Anderson&#x27;s comedy film &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; (2001).
Frank Scheck of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote, &quot;Hackman is utter perfection as the misbegotten paterfamilias, conveying beautifully Royal’s underlying decency and love for his family as well as his con-man slickness&quot;. For his performance, he received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. 

In 2003, he also starred in another John Grisham legal drama, &quot;Runaway Jury&quot;, at long last getting to make a picture with his long-time friend Dustin Hoffman. In 2004, Hackman appeared alongside Ray Romano in the comedy &quot;Welcome to Mooseport&quot;, his final film acting role. Hackman was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award from the Golden Globe Awards for his &quot;outstanding contribution to the entertainment field&quot; in 2003. Michael Caine and Robin Williams presented him with the award. On July 7, 2004, Hackman gave a rare interview to Larry King, where he announced that he had no future film projects lined up and believed his acting career was over. He narrated four episodes of the NFL Films sports documentary series &quot;America&#x27;s Game: The Super Bowl Champions&quot; in 2007. In 2008, while promoting his third novel, he confirmed that he had retired from acting. That same year, Hackman made his last televised appearance in &quot;Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives&quot;, as Guy Fieri went to a Santa Fe diner where Hackman was eating.

Speaking on his retirement in 2009, Hackman said, &quot;The straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back was actually a stress test that I took in New York. The doctor advised me that my heart wasn&#x27;t in the kind of shape that I should be putting it under any stress&quot;. When asked during a &quot;GQ&quot; magazine interview in 2011 if he would ever come out of retirement to do one more film, he said he might consider it &quot;if I could do it in my own house, maybe, without them disturbing anything and just one or two people.&quot; He briefly came out of retirement to narrate two documentaries related to the United States Marine Corps: &quot;The Unknown Flag Raiser of Iwo Jima&quot; (2016)&quot;&quot; and &quot;We, the Marines&quot; (2017)&quot;.&quot;

== Writing ==

Together with undersea archaeologist Daniel Lenihan, Hackman wrote three historical fiction novels: &quot;Wake of the Perdido Star&quot; (1999), a sea adventure of the 19th century; &quot;Justice for None&quot; (2004), a Depression-era tale of murder based on a real-life crime in his boyhood town of Danville; and &quot;Escape from Andersonville&quot; (2008), about a prison escape during the American Civil War. His first solo effort, a story of love and revenge set in the Old West titled &quot;Payback at Morning Peak&quot;, was released in 2011. His final novel &quot;Pursuit&quot;, a police thriller, followed in 2013.

== Personal life ==

=== Marriages and family ===
In 1956, Hackman married Faye Maltese, with whom he had one son and two daughters: Christopher Allen, Elizabeth Jean, and Leslie Anne Hackman. He was often out on location making films while the children were growing up. The couple divorced in 1986, after three decades of marriage.

In 1991, Hackman married classical pianist Betsy Arakawa (1959–2025). They shared a Santa Fe, New Mexico, home, which &quot;Architectural Digest&quot; featured in 1990. At the time, the home blended Southwestern styles and was at the crest of a twelve-acre hilltop, with a 360-degree view that stretched to the Jemez, Sangre de Cristo and Sandia mountains. , Hackman continued to attend Santa Fe cultural events.

=== Views and interests ===

Hackman was a supporter of the Democratic Party, and said he was &quot;proud&quot; to be included on Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List. However, he spoke fondly about Republican president Ronald Reagan.

In the late 1970s, Hackman competed in Sports Car Club of America races, driving an open-wheeled Formula Ford. In 1980, he won the Long Beach Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race. He also drove a Dan Gurney Team Toyota in the 24 Hours of Daytona Endurance Race in 1983.

Hackman was a fan of the Jacksonville Jaguars, an NFL football team based in Jacksonville, Florida and regularly attended Jaguars games as a guest of former head coach Jack Del Rio. Their friendship went back to Del Rio&#x27;s playing days at the University of Southern California.

Hackman was also interested in architecture and design. As of 1990, he had created ten homes, two of which were featured in &quot;Architectural Digest&quot;. After a period of time, he moved on to another house restoration. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with me,&quot; he remarked, &quot;I guess I like the process, and when it&#x27;s over, it&#x27;s over.&quot;

As of 2018, Hackman was an active cyclist.

=== Health ===
In 1990, Hackman underwent an angioplasty. In 2012, the 82-year-old Hackman was struck by a pickup truck while he was cycling in the Florida Keys. It was initially reported that he had suffered serious head trauma; however, his publicist stated that his injury was nothing more than &quot;bumps and bruises&quot;.

== Death ==
On February 26, 2025, Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa, and one of their three dogs were found dead at their residence in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Hackman was 95 years old. The discovery was made by a maintenance worker who, upon discovering the bodies, contacted emergency services, prompting the arrival of Sheriff&#x27;s deputies. The maintenance workers reported that they had last communicated with the couple two weeks prior to the discovery.

Deputies found Hackman&#x27;s body in an advanced state of decomposition in the mudroom and Arakawa&#x27;s body in a similar condition in a bathroom, with prescription medications scattered nearby. The medications identified included those for high blood pressure and thyroid conditions. One of their dogs, a German Shepherd, was found dead near Arakawa in the bathroom closet, while the couple&#x27;s two other dogs were discovered alive on the property. A deputy noted that it appeared Hackman had &quot;suddenly fallen&quot;, with evidence suggesting a similar scenario for Arakawa. The deputy also stated that the couple may have been dead for &quot;several days, possibly even up to a couple [of] weeks.&quot; 

On February 27, the Santa Fe County Sheriff&#x27;s Department indicated that there were no significant indications of foul play, though they did not initially specify a time or cause of death. The fire department found no signs of a carbon monoxide leak. The sheriff&#x27;s department has launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deaths. Initial autopsy reports revealed no evidence of external trauma on either body. The bodies had begun to undergo natural mummification by the time they were discovered. On February 28, it was confirmed that the couple tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning. Data retrieved from Hackman&#x27;s pacemaker suggested that he likely died on February 17.

== Tributes and legacy ==
Numerous members of the film industry have paid tribute to Hackman since his death. Clint Eastwood wrote in a statement, &quot;There was no finer actor than Gene. Intense and instinctive. Never a false note. He was also a dear friend whom I will miss very much&quot;. Francis Ford Coppola wrote, &quot;Gene Hackman [was] a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity... I mourn his loss, and celebrate his existence and contribution.&quot; British Academy of Film and Television Arts President Prince William also released a statement, which read in part, &quot;Hackman was a true genius of film who brought each and every character to life with power, authenticity and star quality&quot;.

Others who paid tribute include Morgan Freeman, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Close, Tom Hanks, Viola Davis, Bill Murray, Mel Brooks, Alec Baldwin, Gwyneth Paltrow, Josh Brolin, John Cusack, Nathan Lane, James Woods, Antonio Banderas, Dan Aykroyd, and Hank Azaria. Also Michael Chiklis and Superman co-star Valerie Perrine&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote that Hackman&#x27;s death &quot;marks the end of one of the greatest periods of U.S. cinema: the American New Wave ... He was the character actor who was really a star; in fact the star of every scene he was in – that tough, wised-up, intelligent, but unhandsome face perpetually on the verge of coolly unconcerned derision, or creased in a heartbreakingly fatherly, pained smile.&quot;

<text>Gregor Johann Mendel  (; ; 20 July 1822 – 6 January 1884) was an Austrian biologist, meteorologist, mathematician, Augustinian friar and abbot of St. Thomas&#x27; Abbey in Brno (Brünn), Margraviate of Moravia. Mendel was born in a German-speaking family in the Silesian part of the Austrian Empire (today&#x27;s Czech Republic) and gained posthumous recognition as the founder of the modern science of genetics. Though farmers had known for millennia that crossbreeding of animals and plants could favor certain desirable traits, Mendel&#x27;s pea plant experiments conducted between 1856 and 1863 established many of the rules of heredity, now referred to as the laws of Mendelian inheritance.

Mendel worked with seven characteristics of pea plants: plant height, pod shape and color, seed shape and color, and flower position and color. Taking seed color as an example, Mendel showed that when a true-breeding yellow pea and a true-breeding green pea were cross-bred, their offspring always produced yellow seeds. However, in the next generation, the green peas reappeared at a ratio of 1 green to 3 yellow. To explain this phenomenon, Mendel coined the terms &quot;recessive&quot; and &quot;dominant&quot; in reference to certain traits. In the preceding example, the green trait, which seems to have vanished in the first filial generation, is recessive, and the yellow is dominant. He published his work in 1866, demonstrating the actions of invisible &quot;factors&quot;—now called genes—in predictably determining the traits of an organism.

The profound significance of Mendel&#x27;s work was not recognized until the turn of the 20th century (more than three decades later) with the rediscovery of his laws. Erich von Tschermak, Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns independently verified several of Mendel&#x27;s experimental findings in 1900, ushering in the modern age of genetics.

== Early life and education ==
Mendel was born into a German-speaking family in Heinzendorf bei Odrau, in Silesia, Austrian Empire (now Hynčice in the Czech Republic). He was the son of Anton and Rosine (Schwirtlich) Mendel and had one older sister, Veronika, and one younger, Theresia. They lived and worked on a farm which had been owned by the Mendel family for at least 130 years (the house where Mendel was born is now a museum devoted to Mendel). During his childhood, Mendel worked as a gardener and studied beekeeping. As a young man, he attended gymnasium in Troppau (). Due to illness, he had to take four months off during his gymnasium studies. From 1840 to 1843, he studied practical and theoretical philosophy and physics at the Philosophical Institute of the University of Olomouc (), taking another year off because of illness. He also struggled financially to pay for his studies, and Theresia gave him her dowry. Later he helped support her three sons, two of whom became doctors.

He became a monk partly because it enabled him to obtain an education without paying for it himself. As the son of a struggling farmer, the monastic life, in his words, spared him the &quot;perpetual anxiety about a means of livelihood.&quot; Born Johann Mendel, he was given the name &quot;Gregor&quot; ( in Czech) when he joined the Order of Saint Augustine.

== Academic career ==

When Mendel entered the Faculty of Philosophy, the Department of Natural History and Agriculture was headed by Johann Karl Nestler, who conducted extensive research on hereditary traits of plants and animals, especially sheep. Upon recommendation of his physics teacher Friedrich Franz, Mendel entered the Augustinian St Thomas&#x27;s Abbey in Brno and began his training as a priest. Mendel worked as a substitute high school teacher. In 1850, he failed his exams&#x27; oral part, the last of three parts, to become a certified high school teacher. In 1851, he was sent to the University of Vienna to study under the sponsorship of Abbot Cyril František Napp so that he could get a more formal education. At Vienna, his professor of physics was Christian Doppler. Mendel returned to his abbey in 1853 as a teacher, principally of physics. In 1854 he met Aleksander Zawadzki who encouraged his research in Brno. In 1856, he took the exam to become a certified teacher and again failed the oral part. In 1867, he replaced Napp as abbot of the monastery.

After he was elevated as abbot in 1868, his scientific work largely ended, as Mendel became overburdened with administrative responsibilities, especially a dispute with the civil government over its attempt to impose special taxes on religious institutions. Mendel died on 6 January 1884, at the age of 61, in Brno, from chronic nephritis. Czech composer Leoš Janáček played the organ at his funeral. After his death, the succeeding abbot burned all papers in Mendel&#x27;s collection, to mark an end to the disputes over taxation. The exhumation of Mendel&#x27;s corpse in 2021 delivered some physiognomic details like body height (). His genome was analysed, revealing that Mendel was predisposed to heart problems.

== Contributions ==
=== Experiments on plant hybridization ===
Mendel, known as the &quot;father of modern genetics,&quot; chose to study variation in plants in his monastery&#x27;s experimental garden. Mendel was assisted in his experimental design by Aleksander Zawadzki while his superior abbot Napp wrote to discourage him, saying that the Bishop giggled when informed of the detailed genealogies of peas.

After initial experiments with pea plants, Mendel settled on studying seven traits that seemed to be inherited independently of other traits: seed shape, flower color, seed coat tint, pod shape, unripe pod color, flower location, and plant height. He first focused on seed shape, which was either angular or round. Between 1856 and 1863 Mendel cultivated and tested some 28,000 plants, the majority of which were pea plants (&quot;Pisum sativum&quot;). This study showed that, when true-breeding different varieties were crossed to each other (e.g., tall plants fertilized by short plants), in the second generation, one in four pea plants had purebred recessive traits, two out of four were hybrids, and one out of four were purebred dominant. His experiments led him to make two generalizations, the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment, which later came to be known as Mendel&#x27;s Laws of Inheritance.

==== Initial reception of Mendel&#x27;s work ====
Mendel presented his paper, (&quot;Experiments on Plant Hybridization&quot;), at two meetings of the Natural History Society of Brno in Moravia on 8 February and 8 March 1865. It generated a few favorable reports in local newspapers, but was ignored by the scientific community. When Mendel&#x27;s paper was published in 1866 in , it was seen as essentially about hybridization rather than inheritance, had little impact, and was cited only about three times over the next thirty-five years. His paper was criticized then but is now considered a seminal work. Notably, Charles Darwin was not aware of Mendel&#x27;s paper, and it is envisaged that if he had been aware of it, genetics as it exists now might have taken hold much earlier. Mendel&#x27;s scientific biography thus provides an example of the failure of obscure, highly original innovators to receive the attention they deserve.

==== Rediscovery of Mendel&#x27;s work ====
About forty scientists listened to Mendel&#x27;s two groundbreaking lectures, but it would appear that they failed to understand the implications of his work. Later, he also carried on a correspondence with Carl Nägeli, one of the leading biologists of the time, but Nägeli also failed to appreciate Mendel&#x27;s discoveries. At times, Mendel must have entertained doubts about his work, but not always: &quot;My time will come,&quot; he reportedly told a friend, Gustav von Niessl.

During Mendel&#x27;s lifetime, most biologists held the idea that all characteristics were passed to the next generation through blending inheritance (indeed, many effectively are), in which the traits from each parent are averaged. Instances of this phenomenon are now explained by the action of multiple genes with quantitative effects. Charles Darwin tried unsuccessfully to explain inheritance through a theory of pangenesis. It was not until the early 20th century that the importance of Mendel&#x27;s ideas was realized.

By 1900, research aimed at finding a successful theory of discontinuous inheritance rather than blending inheritance led to independent duplication of his work by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns and the rediscovery of Mendel&#x27;s writings and laws. Both acknowledged Mendel&#x27;s priority, and it is thought probable that de Vries did not understand the results he had found until after reading Mendel. Though Erich von Tschermak was originally also credited with rediscovery, this is no longer accepted because he did not understand Mendel&#x27;s laws. Though de Vries later lost interest in Mendelism, other biologists started to establish modern genetics as a science. All three of these researchers, each from a different country, published their rediscovery of Mendel&#x27;s work within a two-month span in the spring of 1900.

Mendel&#x27;s results were quickly replicated, and genetic linkage quickly worked out. Biologists flocked to the theory; even though it was not yet applicable to many phenomena, it sought to give a genotypic understanding of heredity, which they felt was lacking in previous studies of heredity, which had focused on phenotypic approaches. Most prominent of these previous approaches was the biometric school of Karl Pearson and W. F. R. Weldon, which was based heavily on statistical studies of phenotype variation. The strongest opposition to this school came from William Bateson, who perhaps did the most in the early days of publicising the benefits of Mendel&#x27;s theory (the word &quot;genetics&quot;, and much of the discipline&#x27;s other terminology, originated with Bateson). This debate between the biometricians and the Mendelians was extremely vigorous in the first two decades of the 20th century, with the biometricians claiming statistical and mathematical rigor, whereas the Mendelians claimed a better understanding of biology. Modern genetics shows that Mendelian heredity is, in fact, an inherently biological process, though not all genes of Mendel&#x27;s experiments are yet understood.

Ultimately, the two approaches were combined, especially by work conducted by R. A. Fisher as early as 1918. The combination, in the 1930s and 1940s, of Mendelian genetics with Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection resulted in the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology.

In the Soviet Union and China, Mendelian genetics was rejected in favor of Lamarckism, leading to imprisonment and even execution of Mendelian geneticists (see Lysenkoism).

=== Other experiments ===
Mendel also experimented with hawkweed (&quot;Hieracium&quot;). He published a report on his work with hawkweed, a group of plants of great interest to scientists at the time because of their diversity. However, the results of Mendel&#x27;s inheritance study in hawkweeds were unlike those for peas; the first generation was very variable, and many of their offspring were identical to the maternal parent. In his correspondence with Carl Nägeli he discussed his results but was unable to explain them. It was not appreciated until the end of the nineteenth century that many hawkweed species were apomictic, producing most of their seeds through an asexual process.

Mendel appears to have kept animals at the monastery, breeding bees in custom-designed bee hives. None of his results on bees survived, except for a passing mention in the reports of the Moravian Apiculture Society. All that is known definitely is that he used Cyprian and Carniolan bees, which were particularly aggressive, to the annoyance of other monks and visitors of the monastery, such that he was asked to get rid of them. Mendel, on the other hand, was fond of his bees and referred to them as &quot;my dearest little animals&quot;.

After his death, Mendel&#x27;s colleagues remembered that he bred mice, crossing varieties of different size, although Mendel has left no record of any such work. A persistent myth has developed that Mendel turned his attention to plants only after Napp declared it unseemly for a celibate priest to closely observe rodent sex. In a 2022 biography, Daniel Fairbanks argued that Napp could hardly have given such a pronouncement, as Napp personally oversaw sheep breeding on the monastery&#x27;s extensive agricultural estate. 

Mendel also studied astronomy and meteorology, founding the &#x27;Austrian Meteorological Society&#x27; in 1865. The majority of his published works were related to meteorology.

He also described novel plant species, and these are denoted with the botanical author abbreviation &quot;Mendel&quot;.

== Mendelian paradox ==
In 1936, Ronald Fisher, a prominent statistician and population geneticist, reconstructed Mendel&#x27;s experiments, analyzed results from the F2 (second filial) generation, and found the ratio of dominant to recessive phenotypes (e.g., yellow versus green peas; round versus wrinkled peas) to be implausibly and consistently too close to the expected ratio of 3 to 1. Fisher asserted that &quot;the data of most, if not all, of the experiments have been falsified to agree closely with Mendel&#x27;s expectations&quot;. Mendel&#x27;s alleged observations, according to Fisher, were &quot;abominable,&quot; &quot;shocking,&quot; and &quot;cooked.&quot;

Other scholars agree with Fisher that Mendel&#x27;s various observations come uncomfortably close to Mendel&#x27;s expectations. A. W. F. Edwards, for instance, remarks: &quot;One can applaud the lucky gambler; but when he is lucky again tomorrow, and the next day, and the following day, one is entitled to become a little suspicious&quot;. Three other lines of evidence likewise lend support to the assertion that Mendel&#x27;s results are indeed too good to be true.

Fisher&#x27;s analysis gave rise to the Mendelian paradox: Mendel&#x27;s reported data are, statistically speaking, too good to be true, yet &quot;everything we know about Mendel suggests that he was unlikely to engage in either deliberate fraud or in an unconscious adjustment of his observations&quot;. Several writers have attempted to resolve this paradox.

One attempted explanation invokes confirmation bias. Fisher accused Mendel&#x27;s experiments as &quot;biased strongly in the direction of agreement with expectation[...] to give the theory the benefit of the doubt&quot;. In a 2004 article, J.W. Porteous concluded that Mendel&#x27;s observations were indeed implausible. An explanation for Mendel&#x27;s results based on tetrad pollen has been proposed, but reproduction of the experiments showed no evidence that the tetrad-pollen model explains any of the bias.

Another attempt to resolve the Mendelian paradox notes that a conflict may sometimes arise between the moral imperative of a bias-free recounting of one&#x27;s factual observations and the even more important imperative of advancing scientific knowledge. Mendel might have felt compelled &quot;to simplify his data to meet real, or feared editorial objections.&quot; Such an action could be justified on moral grounds (and hence provide a resolution to the Mendelian paradox) since the alternative—refusing to comply—might have hindered the growth of scientific knowledge. Similarly, like so many other obscure innovators of science, Mendel, a little-known innovator of working-class background, had to &quot;break through the cognitive paradigms and social prejudices&quot; of his audience. If such a breakthrough &quot;could be best achieved by deliberately omitting some observations from his report and adjusting others to make them more palatable to his audience, such actions could be justified on moral grounds.&quot;

Daniel L. Hartl and Daniel J. Fairbanks reject outright Fisher&#x27;s statistical argument, suggesting that Fisher incorrectly interpreted Mendel&#x27;s experiments. They find it likely that Mendel scored more than ten progeny and that the results matched the expectation. They conclude: &quot;Fisher&#x27;s allegation of deliberate falsification can finally be put to rest, because on closer analysis it has proved to be unsupported by convincing evidence&quot;. In 2008 Hartl and Fairbanks (with Allan Franklin and AWF Edwards) wrote a comprehensive book in which they concluded that there were no reasons to assert Mendel fabricated his results, nor that Fisher deliberately tried to diminish Mendel&#x27;s legacy. Reassessment of Fisher&#x27;s statistical analysis, according to these authors, also disproves the notion of confirmation bias in Mendel&#x27;s results.

==Commemoration==
Mount Mendel in New Zealand&#x27;s Paparoa Range was named after him in 1970 by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In celebration of his 200th birthday, Mendel&#x27;s body was exhumed and his DNA sequenced.

<text>Grappling is a fighting technique based on throws, trips, sweeps, clinch fighting, ground fighting and submission holds.

Grappling contests often involve takedowns and ground control, and may end when a contestant concedes defeat. Should there be no winner after the match time-limit has lapsed, competition judges will determine the winner based on who exerted more control.

Grappling most commonly does not include striking or the use of weapons. However, some fighting styles or martial arts known especially for their grappling techniques teach tactics that include strikes and weapons either alongside grappling or combined with it.

== Types of technique ==

Grappling techniques can be broadly subdivided into clinch fighting; takedowns and throws; submission holds and pinning or controlling techniques; and sweeps, reversals, turnovers, and escapes.
* Clinching: or clinch work, takes place with both competitors on their feet using various clinch holds applied to the upper body of the opponent. Clinch work is generally used to set up or defend against throws or takedowns.
* Takedowns : A takedown is used by one grappler to manipulate their opponent from a standing position to a position on the ground. The grappler completing the takedown aims to end in a dominant position.
* Throws: A throw is a technique in which one grappler lifts or off-balances their opponent and maneuvers them forcefully through the air or to the ground. The purpose of throws varies among the different disciplines of grappling with some emphasizing throws with the potential to incapacitate the opponent, while leaving the thrower standing, or to gain a takedown or controlling position.
* Sprawling : A sprawl is a defensive technique usually used when the opponent attempts a takedown. It is performed by shifting the legs backwards and spread out in one fast motion. If done correctly one will land on their opponent&#x27;s back and gain control.
* Submission holds: There are generally two types of submission holds: those that would potentially strangle or suffocate an opponent (chokes), and those that would potentially cause injury to a joint or other body part (locks ). In sport grappling, a competitor is expected to submit, either verbally or by tapping the opponent, to admit defeat when they are caught in a submission hold they cannot escape. Competitors who refuse to &quot;tap out&quot; risk unconsciousness or serious injury.
* Securing or controlling techniques: A pin involves holding an opponent on their back in a position where they are unable to attack. In some styles of competitive grappling a pin is an instant victory, and in other styles it is considered a dominant position that is awarded with points. Other controlling techniques are used to hold an opponent face down on the ground or on all fours in order to prevent an escape or attack. Either of these types of technique may also be used as a prelude to a submission hold.
* Escapes: In a general sense, an escape is accomplished by maneuvering out of danger or from an inferior position; for example when a grappler who is underneath side control moves to guard or gets back to a neutral standing position, or when a grappler is able to maneuver out of a submission attempt and back to a position where they are no longer in immediate danger of being submitted.
* Turnovers: used to maneuver an opponent who is on all fours or flat on their stomach to their back, in order to score points, prepare for a pin or in order to gain a more dominant position.
* Reversals or sweeps: These occur when a grappler who was underneath their opponent on the ground is able to maneuver so that they gain a top position over their opponent.

== Use ==
The degree to which grappling is utilized in different fighting systems varies. Some systems, such as amateur wrestling, pehlwani, judo and Brazilian jiu-jitsu are exclusively grappling arts and do not allow striking. Some other grappling arts allow some limited forms of striking, for example in sumo and in combat jiu jitsu it is possible to strike with open hands (slapping). Many combat sports, such as shooto and mixed martial arts competitions, use both grappling and striking extensively as part of the sport.
Grappling is not allowed in some martial arts and combat sports, usually for the sake of focusing on other aspects of combat such as punching, kicking or mêlée weapons. Opponents in these types of matches, however, still grapple with each other occasionally when fatigued or in pain; when either occurs, the referee will step in and restart the match, sometimes giving a warning to one or both of the fighters. Examples of these include boxing, kickboxing, taekwondo, karate, and fencing. While prolonged grappling in Muay Thai will result in a separation of the competitors, the art extensively uses the clinch hold known as a double collar tie.

Grappling techniques and defenses to grappling techniques are also considered important in self-defense applications and in law enforcement. The most common grappling techniques taught for self-defense are escapes from holds and application of pain compliance techniques.

Grappling can be trained for self-defense, sport, and mixed martial arts (MMA) competition.

==Stand-up grappling==
Stand-up grappling is arguably an integral part of all grappling and clinch fighting arts, considering that two combatants generally start fighting from a stand-up position. The aim of stand-up grappling varies according to the martial arts or combat sports in question. Defensive stand-up grappling concerns itself with pain-compliance holds and escapes from possible grappling holds applied by an opponent, while offensive grappling techniques include submission holds, trapping, takedowns and throws, all of which can be used to inflict serious damage, or to move the fight to the ground. Stand-up grappling can also be used both offensively and defensively simultaneously with striking, either to trap an opponent&#x27;s arms while striking, prevent the opponent from obtaining sufficient distance to strike effectively, or to bring the opponent close to apply, for instance, knee strikes.

In combat sports, stand-up grappling usually revolves around successful takedowns and throws. Grappling is a major part of combat glima and Løse-tak sport glima, and the fight continues on the ground if both combatants end up there. In other martial sports such as MMA, the fight may continue on the ground.

==Ground grappling==

Ground grappling refers to all the grappling techniques that are applied while the grapplers are no longer in a standing position. A large part of most martial arts and combat sports which feature ground grappling is positioning and obtaining a dominant position. A dominant position (usually on top) allows the dominant grappler a variety of options, including: attempting to escape by standing up, obtaining a pin or hold-down to control and exhaust the opponent, executing a submission hold, or striking the opponent. The bottom grappler is, on the other hand, concerned with escaping the situation and improving their position, typically by using a sweep or reversal. In some disciplines, especially those where the guard is used, the bottom grappler may also be able to finish the fight from the bottom by a submission hold. Some people feel more confident on the bottom because of the large number of submissions that can be accomplished from having the opponent in full-guard.

== Applications ==
When unskilled fighters get embroiled in combat, a common reaction is to grab the opponent in an attempt to slow the situation down by holding them still, resulting in an unsystematic struggle that relies on brute force. A skilled fighter, in contrast, can perform takedowns as a way of progressing to a superior position such as a Mount (grappling) or side control, or using clinch holds and ground positions to set up strikes, choke holds, and joint locks. A grappler who has been taken down to the ground can use defensive positions such as the Guard (grappling), which protects against being mounted or attacked. If a grappler is strong and can utilize leverage well, a takedown or throw itself can be a fight-ending maneuver; the impact can render an opponent unconscious. On the other hand, grappling also offers the possibility of controlling an opponent without injuring them. For this reason, most police staff receive some training in grappling. Likewise, grappling sports have been devised so that their participants can compete using full physical effort without injuring their opponents.

Grappling is called &quot;dumog&quot; in Eskrima. The term &quot;chin na&quot; in Chinese martial arts deals with the use of grappling to achieve submission or incapacitation of the opponent (these may involve the use of acupressure points). Some Chinese martial arts, aikido, some eskrima systems, the Viking martial art of glima, as well as medieval and Renaissance European martial arts, practice grappling while one or both participants is armed. Their practice is significantly more dangerous than unarmed grappling and generally requires a great deal of training.

== Types of grappling ==

There are many different regional styles of grappling around the world that are practiced within a limited geographic area or country. Several martial arts and fighting disciplines employ grappling techniques, such as judo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Cornish wrestling, catch wrestling, shoot wrestling, submission grappling, sambo, hapkido and several types of wrestling including freestyle and Greco-Roman have gained global popularity. Judo, Freestyle Wrestling, and Greco-Roman Wrestling are Olympic Sports while Grappling, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and Sambo have their own World Championship Competitions. Other known grappling-oriented systems are sumo, shuai jiao, malla-yuddha and aikido.

In these arts, the object is either to take down and pin the opponent, or to catch the adversary in a specialized chokehold or joint lock which forces them to submit and admit defeat or be rendered helpless (unconscious or broken limbs). There are two forms of dress for grappling that dictate pace and style of action: with a jacket, such as a &quot;gi&quot; or kurtka, and without (No-Gi). The jacket, or &quot;gi&quot;, form most often utilizes grips on the cloth to control the opponent&#x27;s body, while the &quot;no-&quot;gi&quot;&quot; form emphasizes body control of the torso and head using only the natural holds provided by the body. The use of a jacket is compulsory in judo competition, sambo competition, and most Brazilian jiu-jitsu competition, as well as a variety of folk wrestling styles around the world. Jackets are not used in many forms of wrestling, such as Olympic Freestyle, Greco-Roman wrestling and Grappling.

Grappling techniques are also used in mixed martial arts along with striking techniques. Strikes can be used to set up grappling techniques and vice versa.

===ADCC===
The ADCC Submission Fighting World Championship is the most prestigious submission grappling tournament in the world and is held biannually.

===Mundials===
The World Jiu-Jitsu Championship, also commonly called the Mundials (Portuguese for &quot;Worlds&quot;), is the most prestigious jacketed full range (takedown, position, and submission inclusive) grappling tournament in the world. The event also hosts a non-jacketed division (no gi), but that sub-event is not as prestigious as ADCC in terms of pure non-jacketed competition.

===United World Wrestling===
United World Wrestling (UWW) is the international governing body for the sport of wrestling. It presides over international competitions for various forms of wrestling, including Grappling for men and women. The flagship Grappling&#x27;s event of UWW is the Grappling World Championships.

===NAGA===
The North American Grappling Association (NAGA) is an organization started in 1995 that holds submission grappling and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu tournaments throughout North America and Europe. NAGA is the largest submission grappling association in the world with over 175,000 participants worldwide, including some of the top submission grapplers and MMA fighters in the world. NAGA grappling tournaments consist of gi and no-gi divisions. No-Gi competitors compete under rules drafted by NAGA. Gi competitors compete under standardized Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu rules. Notable Champions Frank Mir, Joe Fiorentino, Jon Jones, Khabib Nurmagomedov, Anthony Porcelli and Antonio Bustorff.

<text>George Mason University (GMU) is a public research university in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. Located in Northern Virginia near Washington, D.C., the university is named in honor of George Mason, a Founding Father of the United States.

The university was founded in 1949 as a northern branch of the University of Virginia. It became an independent university in 1972, and it has since grown into the largest public university by student enrollment in Virginia. It has expanded into a residential college for traditional students while maintaining its historic commuter student-inclusive environment at both undergraduate and post-graduate levels, with an emphasis on combining modern professional education with a traditional liberal arts curriculum.

The university operates four campuses; the flagship campus is in Fairfax, Virginia. Its other three campuses are in Arlington, Front Royal, and Prince William County. It also operates a retreat and conference center in Lorton and an international campus in Incheon, South Korea. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. Since the university&#x27;s founding, two of its economics professors have received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics: James M. Buchanan in 1986 and Vernon L. Smith in 2002.

==History==

===20th century===
In 1949, the University of Virginia created an extension center to serve mid-career working professionals and non-traditional students near urban centers in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. The extension center offered both for credit and non-credit informal classes in the evenings at various pre-existing venues. The first for credit classes offered were: &quot;Government in the Far East, Introduction to International Politics, English Composition, Principles of Economics, Mathematical Analysis, Introduction to Mathematical Statistics, and Principles of Lip Reading.&quot; By the end of 1952, enrollment was 1,192 students.
A resolution of the Virginia General Assembly in January 1956 changed the extension center into University College, the Northern Virginia branch of the University of Virginia. John Norville Gibson Finley served as director. Seventeen freshmen students attended classes at University College in a small renovated elementary school building in Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads starting in September 1957. In 1958 University College became George Mason College.

The City of Fairfax purchased and donated of land just south of the city limits to the University of Virginia for the college&#x27;s new site, which is now referred to as the Fairfax Campus. In 1959, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia selected a permanent name for the college: George Mason College of the University of Virginia. The Fairfax campus construction planning that began in early 1960 showed visible results when the development of the first of Fairfax Campus began in 1962. In the Fall of 1964 the new campus welcomed 356 students.

In 1966, in the Virginia General Assembly, Alexandria delegate James M. Thomson, with the backing of the University of Virginia, introduced a bill in the General Assembly to make George Mason College a four-year institution under the University of Virginia&#x27;s direction. The measure, known as H 33, passed the Assembly easily and was approved on March 1, 1966, making George Mason College a degree-granting institution. During that same year, the local jurisdictions of Fairfax County, Arlington County, and the cities of Alexandria and Falls Church agreed to appropriate $3 million to purchase land adjacent to Mason to provide for a Fairfax Campus with the intention that the institution would expand into a regional university of major proportions, including the granting of graduate degrees.

In 1972, Virginia separated George Mason College from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville and renamed it George Mason University.
In 1978, George W. Johnson was appointed to serve as the fourth president. Under his eighteen-year tenure, the university expanded both its physical size and program offerings at a tremendous rate. Shortly before Johnson&#x27;s inauguration in April 1979, Mason acquired the School of Law and the new Arlington Campus. The university also became a doctoral institution. Toward the end of Johnson&#x27;s term, Mason would be deep in planning for a third campus in Prince William County at Manassas. Major campus facilities, such as Student Union Building II, EagleBank Arena, Center for the Arts, and the Johnson Learning Center, were all constructed over the course of Johnson&#x27;s eighteen years as University President. Enrollment once again more than doubled from 10,767 during the fall of 1978 to 24,368 in the spring of 1996.

In 1996, Alan Merten, dean of the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University was appointed the university&#x27;s president. He believed that the university&#x27;s location made it responsible for both contributing to and drawing from its surrounding communities—local, national, and global. George Mason was becoming recognized and acclaimed in all of these spheres. During Merten&#x27;s tenure, the university hosted the World Congress of Information Technology in 1998, celebrated a second Nobel Memorial Prize-winning faculty member in 2002, and cheered the Men&#x27;s basketball team in their NCAA Final Four appearance in 2006. Enrollment increased from just over 24,000 students in 1996 to approximately 33,000 during the spring semester of 2012, making Mason Virginia&#x27;s largest public university.

===21st century===
Following Merten&#x27;s retirement in 2012, Ángel Cabrera was appointed the university&#x27;s sixth president on July 1, 2012.

In a resolution on August 17, 2012, the board asked Cabrera to create a new strategic vision that would help Mason remain relevant and competitive in the future. The drafting of the Vision for Mason, from conception to official outline, created a new mission statement that defines the university.

On March 25, 2013, Cabrera held a press conference to announce the university&#x27;s decision to leave the Colonial Athletic Association to join the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10). The announcement came just days after the Board of Visitors&#x27; approval of the university&#x27;s vision document that Cabrera had overseen. Mason began competition in the A-10 during the 2013–2014 academic year. &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; listed Mason as one of the &quot;Great Colleges to Work For&quot; from 2010 to 2014. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; listed Mason as one of the &quot;Top Workplaces&quot; in 2014.

The WorldatWork Alliance for Work-Life Progress awarded Mason the Seal of Distinction in 2015. The AARP listed Mason as one of the Best Employers for Workers Over 50 in 2013. Phi Beta Kappa established a chapter at the university in 2013.

In 2018, a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit revealed that conservative donors, including the Charles Koch Foundation and Federalist Society, were given direct influence over faculty hiring decisions at the university&#x27;s law and economics schools. GMU President Ángel Cabrera acknowledged that the revelations raised questions about the university&#x27;s academic integrity and pledged to prohibit donors from sitting on faculty selection committees in the future.

Cabrera resigned his position on July 31, 2019, to become president of Georgia Tech. Following Cabrera&#x27;s resignation, Anne B. Holton served as interim president until June 30, 2020.

On February 24, 2020, the Board of Visitors appointed Gregory Washington as the university&#x27;s eighth president, and he assumed that role on July 1, 2020. Washington is the university&#x27;s first African-American president.

On March 23, 2020, George Mason shifted to exclusively online instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hybrid instruction occurred during the Fall 2020, Spring 2021, and Fall 2021 semesters during which the university offered a combination of online and in-person instruction.

Mild unrest occurred on George Mason&#x27;s campus in the aftermath of the October 7, 2023 attack of Hamas on Israel and the resulting war. Statements denouncing antisemitism and Islamophobia were made by the Office of the President. An encampment on nearby George Washington University&#x27;s campus was organized in part by George Mason students.

==Campuses==

George Mason University has four campuses in the United States, each of which is located in Virginia. Three are in the Northern Virginia suburbs of the Washington metropolitan area, and one is in Virginia&#x27;s Blue Ridge Mountains. The university also has one campus in South Korea, in the Songdo International Business District of Incheon. Between 2005 and 2009 the university had a campus at Ras al-Khaimah, United Arab Emirates. The Blue Ridge campus, just outside Front Royal, is run in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution.

<text>In linguistics, grammar is the set of rules for how a natural language is structured, as demonstrated by its speakers or writers. Grammar rules may concern the use of clauses, phrases, and words. The term may also refer to the study of such rules, a subject that includes phonology, morphology, and syntax, together with phonetics, semantics, and pragmatics. There are, broadly speaking, two different ways to study grammar: traditional grammar and theoretical grammar.

Fluency in a particular language variety involves a speaker internalizing these rules, many or most of which are acquired by observing other speakers, as opposed to intentional study or instruction. Much of this internalization occurs during early childhood; learning a language later in life usually involves more direct instruction. The term &quot;grammar&quot; can also describe the linguistic behaviour of groups of speakers and writers rather than individuals. Differences in scale are important to this meaning: for example, English grammar could describe those rules followed by every one of the language&#x27;s speakers. At smaller scales, it may refer to rules shared by smaller groups of speakers.

A description, study, or analysis of such rules may also be known as a grammar, or as a grammar book. A reference work describing the grammar of a language is called a &quot;reference grammar&quot; or simply a &quot;grammar&quot;. A fully revealed grammar, which describes the grammatical constructions of a particular speech type in great detail is called descriptive grammar. This kind of linguistic description contrasts with linguistic prescription, a plan to marginalize some constructions while codifying others, either absolutely or in the framework of a standard language. The word &quot;grammar&quot; often has divergent meanings when used in contexts outside linguistics. It may be used more broadly to include orthographic conventions of written language, such as spelling and punctuation, which are not typically considered part of grammar by linguists; that is, the conventions used for writing a language. It may also be used more narrowly to refer to a set of prescriptive norms only, excluding the aspects of a language&#x27;s grammar which do not change or are clearly acceptable (or not) without the need for discussions.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;grammar&quot; is derived from Greek (&quot;grammatikḕ téchnē&quot;), which means &quot;art of letters&quot;, from (&quot;grámma&quot;), &quot;letter&quot;, itself from (&quot;gráphein&quot;), &quot;to draw, to write&quot;. The same Greek root also appears in the words &quot;graphics&quot;, &quot;grapheme&quot;, and &quot;photograph&quot;.

== History ==
The first systematic grammar of Sanskrit originated in Iron Age India, with Yaska (6th century BC), Pāṇini (6th–5th century BC) and his commentators Pingala (), Katyayana, and Patanjali (2nd century BC). Tolkāppiyam, the earliest Tamil grammar, is mostly dated to before the 5th century AD. The Babylonians also made some early attempts at language description.

Grammar appeared as a discipline in Hellenism from the 3rd century BC forward with authors such as Rhyanus and Aristarchus of Samothrace. The oldest known grammar handbook is the &quot;Art of Grammar&quot; (), a succinct guide to speaking and writing clearly and effectively, written by the ancient Greek scholar Dionysius Thrax (), a student of Aristarchus of Samothrace who founded a school on the Greek island of Rhodes. Dionysius Thrax&#x27;s grammar book remained the primary grammar textbook for Greek schoolboys until as late as the twelfth century AD. The Romans based their grammatical writings on it and its basic format remains the basis for grammar guides in many languages even today. Latin grammar developed by following Greek models from the 1st century BC, due to the work of authors such as Orbilius Pupillus, Remmius Palaemon, Marcus Valerius Probus, Verrius Flaccus, and Aemilius Asper.

The grammar of Irish originated in the 7th century with Auraicept na n-Éces. Arabic grammar emerged with Abu al-Aswad al-Du&#x27;ali in the 7th century. The first treatises on Hebrew grammar appeared in the High Middle Ages, in the context of Midrash (exegesis of the Hebrew Bible). The Karaite tradition originated in Abbasid Baghdad. The &quot;Diqduq&quot; (10th century) is one of the earliest grammatical commentaries on the Hebrew Bible. Ibn Barun in the 12th century, compares the Hebrew language with Arabic in the Islamic grammatical tradition.

Belonging to the &quot;trivium&quot; of the seven liberal arts, grammar was taught as a core discipline throughout the Middle Ages, following the influence of authors from Late Antiquity, such as Priscian. Treatment of vernaculars began gradually during the High Middle Ages, with isolated works such as the First Grammatical Treatise, but became influential only in the Renaissance and Baroque periods. In 1486, Antonio de Nebrija published &quot;Las introduciones Latinas contrapuesto el romance al Latin&quot;, and the first Spanish grammar, &quot;Gramática de la lengua castellana&quot;, in 1492. During the 16th-century Italian Renaissance, the &quot;Questione della lingua&quot; was the discussion on the status and ideal form of the Italian language, initiated by Dante&#x27;s &quot;de vulgari eloquentia&quot; (Pietro Bembo, &quot;Prose della volgar lingua&quot; Venice 1525). The first grammar of Slovene was written in 1583 by Adam Bohorič, and &quot;Grammatica Germanicae Linguae&quot;, the first grammar of German, was published in 1578.

Grammars of some languages began to be compiled for the purposes of evangelism and Bible translation from the 16th century onward, such as &quot;Grammatica o Arte de la Lengua General de Los Indios de Los Reynos del Perú&quot; (1560), a Quechua grammar by Fray Domingo de Santo Tomás.

From the latter part of the 18th century, grammar came to be understood as a subfield of the emerging discipline of modern linguistics. The &quot;Deutsche Grammatik&quot; of Jacob Grimm was first published in the 1810s. The &quot;Comparative Grammar&quot; of Franz Bopp, the starting point of modern comparative linguistics, came out in 1833.

== Theoretical frameworks ==
Frameworks of grammar which seek to give a precise scientific theory of the syntactic rules of grammar and their function have been developed in theoretical linguistics.
* Dependency grammar: dependency relation (Lucien Tesnière 1959)
** Link grammar
* Functional grammar (structural–functional analysis):
** Danish Functionalism
** Functional Discourse Grammar
** Role and reference grammar
** Systemic functional grammar
* Montague grammar

Other frameworks are based on an innate &quot;universal grammar&quot;, an idea developed by Noam Chomsky. In such models, the object is placed into the verb phrase. The most prominent biologically oriented theories are:

* Cognitive grammar / Cognitive linguistics
** Construction grammar
*** Fluid Construction Grammar
** Word grammar
* Generative grammar:
** Transformational grammar (1960s)
** Generative semantics (1970s) and Semantic Syntax (1990s)
** Phrase structure grammar (late 1970s)
*** Generalized phrase structure grammar (late 1970s)
**** Head-driven phrase structure grammar (1985)
**** Principles and parameters grammar (Government and binding theory) (1980s)
** Lexical functional grammar
** Categorial grammar (lambda calculus)
** Minimalist program-based grammar (1993)
* Stochastic grammar: probabilistic
** Operator grammar

Parse trees are commonly used by such frameworks to depict their rules. There are various alternative schemes for some grammar:
* Affix grammar over a finite lattice
* Backus–Naur form
* Constraint grammar
* Lambda calculus
* Tree-adjoining grammar
* X-bar theory

== Development ==
Grammars evolve through usage. Historically, with the advent of written representations, formal rules about language usage tend to appear also, although such rules tend to describe writing conventions more accurately than conventions of speech. Formal grammars are codifications of usage which are developed by repeated documentation and observation over time. As rules are established and developed, the prescriptive concept of grammatical correctness can arise. This often produces a discrepancy between contemporary usage and that which has been accepted, over time, as being standard or &quot;correct&quot;. Linguists tend to view prescriptive grammar as having little justification beyond their authors&#x27; aesthetic tastes, although style guides may give useful advice about &quot;standard language employment&quot; based on descriptions of usage in contemporary writings of the same language. Linguistic prescriptions also form part of the explanation for variation in speech, particularly variation in the speech of an individual speaker (for example, why some speakers say &quot;I didn&#x27;t do nothing&quot;, some say &quot;I didn&#x27;t do anything&quot;, and some say one or the other depending on social context).

The formal study of grammar is an important part of children&#x27;s schooling from a young age through advanced learning, though the rules taught in schools are not a &quot;grammar&quot; in the sense that most linguists use, particularly as they are prescriptive in intent rather than descriptive.

Constructed languages (also called &quot;planned languages&quot; or &quot;conlangs&quot;) are more common in the modern day, although still extremely uncommon compared to natural languages. Many have been designed to aid human communication (for example, naturalistic Interlingua, schematic Esperanto, and the highly logical Lojban). Each of these languages has its own grammar.

Syntax refers to the linguistic structure above the word level (for example, how sentences are formed)though without taking into account intonation, which is the domain of phonology. Morphology, by contrast, refers to the structure at and below the word level (for example, how compound words are formed), but above the level of individual sounds, which, like intonation, are in the domain of phonology. However, no clear line can be drawn between syntax and morphology. Analytic languages use syntax to convey information that is encoded by inflection in synthetic languages. In other words, word order is not significant, and morphology is highly significant in a purely synthetic language, whereas morphology is not significant and syntax is highly significant in an analytic language. For example, Chinese and Afrikaans are highly analytic, thus meaning is very context-dependent. (Both have some inflections, and both have had more in the past; thus, they are becoming even less synthetic and more &quot;purely&quot; analytic over time.) Latin, which is highly synthetic, uses affixes and inflections to convey the same information that Chinese does with syntax. Because Latin words are quite (though not totally) self-contained, an intelligible Latin sentence can be made from elements that are arranged almost arbitrarily. Latin has a complex affixation and simple syntax, whereas Chinese has the opposite.

== Education ==

Prescriptive grammar is taught in primary and secondary school. The term &quot;grammar school&quot; historically referred to a school (attached to a cathedral or monastery) that teaches Latin grammar to future priests and monks. It originally referred to a school that taught students how to read, scan, interpret, and declaim Greek and Latin poets (including Homer, Virgil, Euripides, and others). These should not be mistaken for the related, albeit distinct, modern British grammar schools.
A standard language is a dialect that is promoted above other dialects in writing, education, and, broadly speaking, in the public sphere; it contrasts with vernacular dialects, which may be the objects of study in academic, descriptive linguistics but which are rarely taught prescriptively. The standardized &quot;first language&quot; taught in primary education may be subject to political controversy because it may sometimes establish a standard defining nationality or ethnicity.
Recently, efforts have begun to update grammar instruction in primary and secondary education. The main focus has been to prevent the use of outdated prescriptive rules in favor of setting norms based on earlier descriptive research and to change perceptions about the relative &quot;correctness&quot; of prescribed standard forms in comparison to non-standard dialects. A series of metastudies have found that the explicit teaching of grammatical parts of speech and syntax has little or no effect on the improvement of student writing quality in elementary school, middle school or high school; other methods of writing instruction had far greater positive effect, including strategy instruction, collaborative writing, summary writing, process instruction, sentence combining and inquiry projects.

The preeminence of Parisian French has reigned largely unchallenged throughout the history of modern French literature. Standard Italian is based on the speech of Florence rather than the capital because of its influence on early literature. Likewise, standard Spanish is not based on the speech of Madrid but on that of educated speakers from more northern areas such as Castile and León (see &quot;Gramática de la lengua castellana&quot;). In Argentina and Uruguay the Spanish standard is based on the local dialects of Buenos Aires and Montevideo (Rioplatense Spanish). Portuguese has, for now, two official standards, Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese.

The Serbian variant of Serbo-Croatian is likewise divided; Serbia and the Republika Srpska of Bosnia and Herzegovina use their own distinct normative subvarieties, with differences in yat reflexes. The existence and codification of a distinct Montenegrin standard is a matter of controversy, some treat Montenegrin as a separate standard lect, and some think that it should be considered another form of Serbian.

Norwegian has two standards, &quot;Bokmål&quot; and &quot;Nynorsk&quot;, the choice between which is subject to controversy: Each Norwegian municipality can either declare one as its official language or it can remain &quot;language neutral&quot;. Nynorsk is backed by 27 percent of municipalities. The main language used in primary schools, chosen by referendum within the local school district, normally follows the official language of its municipality. Standard German emerged from the standardized chancellery use of High German in the 16th and 17th centuries. Until about 1800, it was almost exclusively a written language, but now it is so widely spoken that most of the former German dialects are nearly extinct.

Standard Chinese has official status as the standard spoken form of the Chinese language in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), the Republic of China (ROC), and the Republic of Singapore. Pronunciation of Standard Chinese is based on the local accent of Mandarin Chinese from Luanping, Chengde in Hebei Province near Beijing, while grammar and syntax are based on modern vernacular written Chinese.

Modern Standard Arabic is directly based on Classical Arabic, the language of the Qur&#x27;an. The Hindustani language has two standards, Hindi and Urdu.

In the United States, the Society for the Promotion of Good Grammar designated 4 March as National Grammar Day in 2008.

<text>The gigabyte () is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. The prefix &quot;giga&quot; means 109 in the International System of Units (SI). Therefore, one gigabyte is one billion bytes. The unit symbol for the gigabyte is GB.

This definition is used in all contexts of science (especially data science), engineering, business, and many areas of computing, including storage capacities of hard drives, solid-state drives, and tapes, as well as data transmission speeds. The term is also used in some fields of computer science and information technology to denote (10243 or 230) bytes, however, particularly for sizes of RAM. Thus, some usage of &quot;gigabyte&quot; has been ambiguous. To resolve this difficulty, IEC 80000-13 clarifies that a &quot;gigabyte&quot; (GB) is 109 bytes and specifies the term &quot;gibibyte&quot; (GiB) to denote 230 bytes. These differences are still readily seen, for example, when a 400 GB drive&#x27;s capacity is displayed by Microsoft Windows as 372 GB instead of 372 GiB. Analogously, a memory module that is labeled as having the size &quot;&quot; has one gibibyte () of storage capacity.

In response to litigation over whether the makers of electronic storage devices must conform to Microsoft Windows&#x27; use of a binary definition of &quot;GB&quot; instead of the metric/decimal definition, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California rejected that argument, ruling that &quot;the U.S. Congress has deemed the decimal definition of gigabyte to be the &#x27;preferred&#x27; one for the purposes of &#x27;U.S. trade and commerce.

==Definition==
The term &quot;gigabyte&quot; has a standard definition of 10003 bytes, as well as a discouraged meaning of 10243 bytes. The latter binary usage originated as compromise technical jargon for byte multiples that needed to be expressed in a power of 2, but lacked a convenient name. As 1024 (210) is approximately 1000 (103), roughly corresponding to SI multiples, it was used for binary multiples as well.

In 1998 the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) published standards for binary prefixes, requiring that the gigabyte strictly denote 10003 bytes and gibibyte denote 10243 bytes. By the end of 2007, the IEC Standard had been adopted by the IEEE, EU, and NIST, and in 2009 it was incorporated in the International System of Quantities. Nevertheless, the term gigabyte continues to be widely used with the following two different meanings:

===Base 10 (decimal)===
* 1 GB = bytes (= 10003 B = 109 B)
Based on powers of 10, this definition uses the prefix giga- as defined in the International System of Units (SI). This is the recommended definition by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). This definition is used in networking contexts and most storage media, particularly hard drives, flash-based storage, and DVDs, and is also consistent with the other uses of the SI prefix in computing, such as CPU clock speeds or measures of performance. The file manager of Mac OS X version 10.6 and later versions are a notable example of this usage in software, which report files sizes in decimal units.

===Base 2 (binary)===
* 1 GiB = bytes (= 10243 B = 230 B).
The binary definition uses powers of the base 2, as does the architectural principle of binary computers.
This usage is widely promulgated by some operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows in reference to computer memory (e.g., RAM). This definition is synonymous with the unambiguous unit gibibyte.

==Consumer confusion==
Since the first disk drive, the IBM 350, disk drive manufacturers expressed hard drive capacities using decimal prefixes. With the advent of gigabyte-range drive capacities, manufacturers labelled many consumer hard drive, solid-state drive and USB flash drive capacities in certain size classes expressed in decimal gigabytes, such as &quot;500 GB&quot;. The exact capacity of a given drive model is usually slightly larger than the class designation. Practically all manufacturers of hard disk drives and flash-memory disk devices continue to define one gigabyte as , which is displayed on the packaging. Some operating systems such as Mac OS X and Ubuntu, and Debian express hard drive capacity or file size using decimal multipliers, while others such as Microsoft Windows report size using binary multipliers. This discrepancy causes confusion, as a disk with an advertised capacity of, for example, (meaning , equal to 372 GiB) might be reported by the operating system as &quot;&quot;.

For RAM, the JEDEC memory standards use IEEE 100 nomenclature which quote the gigabyte as (230 bytes).

The difference between units based on decimal and binary prefixes increases as a semi-logarithmic (linear-log) function—for example, the decimal kilobyte value is nearly 98% of the kibibyte, a megabyte is under 96% of a mebibyte, and a gigabyte is just over 93% of a gibibyte value. This means that a 300 GB (279 GiB) hard disk might be indicated variously as &quot;300 GB&quot;, &quot;279 GB&quot; or &quot;279 GiB&quot;, depending on the operating system. As storage sizes increase and larger units are used, these differences become more pronounced.

===US lawsuits===
A lawsuit decided in 2019 that arose from alleged breach of contract and other claims over the binary and decimal definitions used for &quot;gigabyte&quot; have ended in favour of the manufacturers, with courts holding that the legal definition of gigabyte or GB is 1 GB = 1,000,000,000 (109) bytes (the decimal definition). Specifically, the courts held that &quot;the U.S. Congress has deemed the decimal definition of gigabyte to be the &#x27;preferred&#x27; one for the purposes of &#x27;U.S. trade and commerce&#x27; ... The California Legislature has likewise adopted the decimal system for all &#x27;transactions in this state&#x27;.&quot;

Earlier lawsuits had ended in settlement with no court ruling on the question, such as a lawsuit against drive manufacturer Western Digital. Western Digital settled the challenge and added explicit disclaimers to products that the usable capacity may differ from the advertised capacity.
Seagate was sued on similar grounds and also settled.

===Other contexts===
Because of their physical design, the capacity of modern computer random-access memory devices, such as DIMM modules, is always a multiple of a power of 1024. It is thus convenient to use prefixes denoting powers of 1024, known as binary prefixes, in describing them. For example, a memory capacity of (10243 B) is conveniently expressed as 1 GiB rather than as 1.074 GB. The former specification is, however, often quoted as &quot;1 GB&quot; when applied to random-access memory.

Software allocates memory in varying degrees of granularity as needed to fulfill data structure requirements and binary multiples are usually not required. Other computer capacities and rates, like storage hardware size, data transfer rates, clock speeds, operations per second, etc. are usually presented in decimal units. For example, the manufacturer of a &quot;300 GB&quot; hard drive is claiming a capacity of , not 300 × 10243 (which would be ) bytes.

==Examples of gigabyte-sized storage==

* One hour of SDTV video at 2.2 Mbit/s is approximately 1 GB.
* Seven minutes of HDTV video at 19.39 Mbit/s is approximately 1 GB.
* 114 minutes of uncompressed CD-quality audio at 1.4 Mbit/s is approximately 1 GB.
* A single-layer DVD+R disc can hold about 4.7 GB.
* A dual-layered DVD+R disc can hold about 8.5 GB.
* A single-layer Blu-ray can hold about 25 GB.
* The largest Nintendo Switch cartridge available on the market holds about 32 GB.
* A dual-layered Blu-ray can hold about 50 GB.
* A triple-layered Ultra HD Blu-ray can hold about 100 GB.
