<doc id="10338" wikidata="Q49822" url="?curid=10338" title="Excommunication">
<text>Excommunication is an institutional act of religious censure used to deprive, suspend, or limit membership in a religious community or to restrict certain rights within it, in particular those of being in communion with other members of the congregation, and of receiving the sacraments.

It is practiced by all of the ancient churches (such as the Catholic Church, Oriental Orthodox churches and the Eastern Orthodox churches) as well as by other Christian denominations; however, it is also used more generally to refer to similar types of institutional religious exclusionary practices and shunning among other religious groups. The Amish have also been known to excommunicate members that were either seen or known for breaking rules, or questioning the church, a practice known as shunning. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses use the term disfellowship to refer to their form of excommunication.

The word &quot;excommunication&quot; means putting a specific individual or group out of communion. In some denominations, excommunication includes spiritual condemnation of the member or group. Excommunication may involve banishment, shunning, and shaming, depending on the group, the offense that caused excommunication, or the rules or norms of the religious community. The grave act is often revoked in response to manifest repentance.

== Bahá&#x27;í Faith ==

Excommunication among Bahá&#x27;ís is rare and generally not used for transgressions of community standards, intellectual dissent, or conversion to other religions. Instead, it is the most severe punishment, reserved for suppressing organized dissent that threatens the unity of believers. &quot;Covenant-breaker&quot; is a term used by Bahá&#x27;ís to refer to a person who has been excommunicated from the Bahá&#x27;í community for breaking the &#x27;Covenant&#x27;: actively promoting schism in the religion or otherwise opposing the legitimacy of the chain of succession of leadership.

Currently, the Universal House of Justice has the sole authority to declare a person a Covenant-breaker, and once identified, all Bahá&#x27;ís are expected to shun them, even if they are family members. According to &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l Baha Covenant-breaking is a contagious disease. The Bahá&#x27;í writings forbid association with Covenant-breakers and Bahá&#x27;ís are urged to avoid their literature, thus providing an exception to the Bahá&#x27;í principle of &quot;independent investigation of truth&quot;. Most Bahá&#x27;ís are unaware of the small Bahá&#x27;í divisions that exist.

== Christianity ==
The purpose of excommunication is to exclude from the church those members who have behaviors or teachings contrary to the beliefs of a Christian community (heresy). It aims to protect members of the church from abuses and allow the offender to recognize their error and repent.

=== Catholic Church ===

Within the Catholic Church, there are differences between the discipline of the majority Latin Church regarding excommunication and that of the Eastern Catholic Churches.

==== Latin Church ====

Excommunication can be either (automatic, incurred at the moment of committing the offense for which canon law imposes that penalty) or (incurred only when imposed by a legitimate superior or declared as the sentence of an ecclesiastical court).
The Catholic Church teaches in the Council of Trent that &quot;excommunicated persons are not members of the Church, because they have been cut off by her sentence from the number of her children and belong not to her communion until they repent&quot;.

In the papal bull (May 16, 1520), Pope Leo X condemned Luther&#x27;s twenty-third proposition according to which &quot;excommunications are merely external punishments, nor do they deprive a man of the common spiritual prayers of the Church&quot;. Pope Pius VI in (August 28, 1794) condemned the notion which maintained that the effect of excommunication is only exterior because of its own nature it excludes only from exterior communion with the Church, as if, said the pope, excommunication were not a spiritual penalty binding in heaven and affecting souls. The excommunicated person, being excluded from the society of the Church, still bears the indelible mark of Baptism and is subject to the jurisdiction of the Church. They are excluded from engaging in certain activities. These activities are listed in Canon 1331 §1, and prohibit the individual from any ministerial participation in celebrating the sacrifice of the Eucharist or any other ceremonies of worship; celebrating or receiving the sacraments; or exercising any ecclesiastical offices, ministries, or functions.
Under current Catholic canon law, excommunicates remain bound by ecclesiastical obligations such as attending Mass, even though they are barred from receiving the Eucharist and from taking an active part in the liturgy (reading, bringing the offerings, etc.). &quot;Excommunicates lose rights, such as the right to the sacraments, but they are still bound to the obligations of the law; their rights are restored when they are reconciled through the remission of the penalty.&quot;

These are the only effects for those who have incurred a excommunication. For instance, a priest may not refuse Communion publicly to those who are under an automatic excommunication, as long as it has not been officially declared to have been incurred by them, even if the priest knows that they have incurred it—although if the person&#x27;s offence was a &quot;manifest grave sin&quot;, then the priest is obliged to refuse their communion by canon 915. On the other hand, if the priest knows that excommunication has been imposed on someone or that an automatic excommunication has been declared (and is no longer merely an undeclared automatic excommunication), he is forbidden to administer Holy Communion to that person.

In the Catholic Church, excommunication is normally resolved by a declaration of repentance, profession of the Creed (if the offense involved heresy) and an Act of Faith, or renewal of obedience (if that was a relevant part of the offending act, i.e., an act of schism) by the excommunicated person and the lifting of the censure (absolution) by a priest or bishop empowered to do this. &quot;The absolution can be in the internal (private) forum only, or also in the external (public) forum, depending on whether scandal would be given if a person were privately absolved and yet publicly considered unrepentant.&quot;

==== Eastern Catholic Churches ====

In the Eastern Catholic Churches, excommunication is imposed only by decree, never incurred automatically by excommunication. A distinction is made between minor and major excommunication. Those on whom minor excommunication has been imposed are excluded from receiving the Eucharist and can also be excluded from participating in the Divine Liturgy. They can even be excluded from entering a church when divine worship is being celebrated there. The decree of excommunication must indicate the precise effect of the excommunication and, if required, its duration.

Those under major excommunication are in addition forbidden to receive not only the Eucharist but also the other sacraments, to administer sacraments or sacramentals, to exercise any ecclesiastical offices, ministries, or functions whatsoever, and any such exercise by them is null and void. They are to be removed from participation in the Divine Liturgy and any public celebrations of divine worship. They are forbidden to make use of any privileges granted to them and cannot be given any dignity, office, ministry, or function in the church, they cannot receive any pension or emoluments associated with these dignities etc., and they are deprived of the right to vote or to be elected.

=== Eastern Orthodox Church ===
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, excommunication is the exclusion of a member from the Eucharist. It is not expulsion from the churches. This can happen for such reasons as not having confessed within that year; excommunication can also be imposed as part of a penitential period. It is generally done with the goal of restoring the member to full communion. Before an excommunication of significant duration is imposed, the bishop is usually consulted. The Eastern Orthodox do have a means of expulsion, by pronouncing anathema, but this is reserved only for acts of serious and unrepentant heresy. As an example of this, the Second Council of Constantinople in 553, in its eleventh capitula, declared: &quot;If anyone does not anathematize Arius, Eunomius, Macedonius, Apollinaris, Nestorius, Eutyches and Origen, as well as their impious writings, as also all other heretics already condemned and anathematized by the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, and by the aforesaid four Holy Synods and [if anyone does not equally anathematize] all those who have held and hold or who in their impiety persist in holding to the end the same opinion as those heretics just mentioned: let him be anathema.&quot;

=== Lutheran churches ===
Although Lutheranism technically has an excommunication process, some denominations and congregations do not use it. In the Smalcald Articles Luther differentiates between the &quot;great&quot; and &quot;small&quot; excommunication. The &quot;small&quot; excommunication is simply barring an individual from the Lord&#x27;s Supper and &quot;other fellowship in the church&quot;. While the &quot;great&quot; excommunication excluded a person from both the church and political communities which he considered to be outside the authority of the church and only for civil leaders. A modern Lutheran practice is laid out in the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod&#x27;s 1986 explanation to the Small Catechism, defined beginning at Questions No. 277–284, in &quot;The Office of Keys&quot;.

Many Lutheran denominations operate under the premise that the entire congregation (as opposed to the pastor alone) must take appropriate steps for excommunication, and there are not always precise rules, to the point where individual congregations often set out rules for excommunicating laymen (as opposed to clergy). For example, churches may sometimes require that a vote must be taken at Sunday services; some congregations require that this vote be unanimous.

In the Church of Sweden and the Church of Denmark, excommunicated individuals are turned out from their parish in front of their congregation. They are not forbidden, however, to attend church and participate in other acts of devotion, although they are to sit in a place appointed by the priest (which was at a distance from others).

The Lutheran process, though rarely used, has created unusual situations in recent years due to its somewhat democratic excommunication process. One example was an effort to get serial killer Dennis Rader excommunicated from his denomination (the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America) by individuals who tried to &quot;lobby&quot; Rader&#x27;s fellow church members into voting for his excommunication.

=== Anglican Communion ===

==== Church of England ====
The Church of England does not have any specific canons regarding how or why a member can be excommunicated, although it has a canon according to which ecclesiastical burial may be refused to someone &quot;declared excommunicate for some grievous and notorious crime and no man to testify to his repentance&quot;.

The punishment of imprisonment for being excommunicated from the Church of England was removed from English law in 1963.

Historian Christopher Hill found that, in pre-revolutionary England, excommunication was common but fell into disrepute because it was applied unevenly and could be avoided on payment of fines.

==== Episcopal Church of the United States of America ====
The ECUSA is in the Anglican Communion, and shares many canons with the Church of England which would determine its policy on excommunication.

=== Reformed churches ===
In the Reformed Churches, excommunication has generally been seen as the culmination of church discipline, which is one of the three marks of the Church. The Westminster Confession of Faith sees it as the third step after &quot;admonition&quot; and &quot;suspension from the sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper for a season.&quot; Yet, John Calvin argues in his &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot; that church censures do not &quot;consign those who are excommunicated to perpetual ruin and damnation&quot;, but are designed to induce repentance, reconciliation and restoration to communion. Calvin notes, &quot;though ecclesiastical discipline does not allow us to be on familiar and intimate terms with excommunicated persons, still we ought to strive by all possible means to bring them to a better mind, and recover them to the fellowship and unity of the Church.&quot;

At least one modern Reformed theologian argues that excommunication is not the final step in the disciplinary process. Jay E. Adams argues that in excommunication, the offender is still seen as a brother, but in the final step they become &quot;as the heathen and tax collector&quot; (Matthew 18:17). Adams writes, &quot;Nowhere in the Bible is excommunication (removal from the fellowship of the Lord&#x27;s Table, according to Adams) equated with what happens in step 5; rather, step 5 is called &#x27;removing from the midst, handing over to Satan,&#x27; and the like.&quot;

Former Princeton president and theologian, Jonathan Edwards, addresses the notion of excommunication as &quot;removal from the fellowship of the Lord&#x27;s Table&quot; in his treatise entitled &quot;The Nature and End of Excommunication&quot;. Edwards argues:
&quot;Particularly, we are forbidden such a degree of associating ourselves with (excommunicants), as there is in making them our guests at our tables, or in being their guests at their tables; as is manifest in the text, where we are commanded to have no company with them, no not to eat [...] That this respects not eating with them at the Lord&#x27;s supper, but a common eating, is evident by the words, that the eating here forbidden, is one of the lowest degrees of keeping company, which are forbidden. Keep no company with such a one, saith the apostle, no not to eat – as much as to say, no not in so low a degree as to eat with him. But eating with him at the Lord&#x27;s supper, is the very highest degree of visible Christian communion. Who can suppose that the apostle meant this: Take heed and have no company with a man, no not so much as in the highest degree of communion that you can have? Besides, the apostle mentions this eating as a way of keeping company which, however, they might hold with the heathen. He tells them, not to keep company with fornicators. Then he informs them, he means not with fornicators of this world, that is, the heathens; but, saith he, &#x27;if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, etc. with such a one keep no company, no not to eat.&#x27; This makes it most apparent, that the apostle doth not mean eating at the Lord&#x27;s table; for so, they might not keep company with the heathens, any more than with an excommunicated person&quot;.

===Methodism===
In the Methodist Episcopal Church, individuals were able to be excommunicated following &quot;trial before a jury of his peers, and after having had the privilege of an appeal to a higher court&quot;. Nevertheless, an excommunication could be lifted after sufficient penance.

John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Churches, excommunicated sixty-four members from the Newcastle Methodist society alone for the following reasons:
The Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection, in its 2014 &quot;Discipline&quot;, includes &quot;homosexuality, lesbianism, bi-sexuality, bestiality, incest, fornication, adultery, and any attempt to alter one&#x27;s gender by surgery&quot;, as well as remarriage after divorce among its excommunicable offences.

The Evangelical Wesleyan Church, in its 2015 &quot;Discipline&quot;, states that &quot;Any member of our church who is accused of neglect of the means of grace or other duties required by the Word of God, the indulgence of sinful tempers, words or actions, the sowing of dissension, or any other violation of the order and discipline of the church, may, after proper labor and admonition, be censured, placed on probation, or expelled by the official board of the circuit of which he is a member. If he request a trial, however, within thirty dates of the final action of the official board, it shall be granted.&quot;

===Anabaptist tradition===

====Amish====
Amish communities practice variations of excommunication known as &quot;shunning&quot;. This practice may include isolation from community events or the cessation of all communication.

====Mennonites====
Mennonite communities use the &quot;ban&quot;, separation and correction on baptized members that fall into sin. Separated members must be avoided or &quot;shunned&quot; until they repent and reform. Shunning must be done in the spirit of moderation and Christian charity; the aim is not to destroy but to reform the person.

====Hutterites====
Hutterite communities use a form of excommunication called &quot;the ban&quot; on baptized members that fall into sin repeatedly.

===Baptists===
For Baptists, excommunication is used as a last resort by denominations and churches for members who do not want to repent of beliefs or behavior at odds with the confession of faith of the community. The vote of community members, however, can restore a person who has been excluded.

=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) practices excommunication as a penalty for those who commit serious sins, &quot;i.e.&quot;, actions that significantly impair the name or moral influence of the church or pose a threat to other people. In 2020, the church ceased using the term &quot;excommunication&quot; and instead refers to &quot;withdrawal of membership&quot;. According to the church leadership &quot;General Handbook&quot;, the purposes of withdrawing membership or imposing membership restrictions are, (1) to help protect others; (2) to help a person access the redeeming power of Jesus Christ through repentance; and (3) to protect the integrity of the Church. The origins of LDS disciplinary procedures and excommunications are traced to a revelation Joseph Smith dictated on 9 February 1831, later canonized as Doctrine and Covenants, section 42 and codified in the &quot;General Handbook&quot;.

The LDS Church also practices the lesser sanctions of private counsel and caution and informal and formal membership restrictions. (Informal membership restrictions was formerly known as &quot;probation&quot;; formal membership restrictions was formerly known as &quot;disfellowshipment&quot;.)

Formal membership restrictions are used for serious sins that do not rise to the level of membership withdrawal. Formal membership restriction denies some privileges but does not include a loss of church membership. Once formal membership restrictions are in place, persons may not take the sacrament or enter church temples, nor may they offer public prayers or sermons. Such persons may continue to attend most church functions and are allowed to wear temple garments, pay tithes and offerings, and participate in church classes if their conduct is orderly. Formal membership restrictions typically lasts for one year, after which one may be reinstated as a member in good standing.

In the more grievous or recalcitrant cases, withdrawal of membership becomes a disciplinary option. Such an action is generally reserved for what are seen as the most serious sins, including committing serious crimes such as murder, child abuse, and incest; committing adultery; involvement in or teaching of polygamy; involvement in homosexual conduct; apostasy; participation in an abortion; teaching false doctrine; or openly criticizing church leaders. The &quot;General Handbook&quot; states that formally joining another church constitutes apostasy and is worthy of membership withdrawal; however, merely attending another church does not constitute apostasy.

A withdrawal of membership can occur only after a formal church membership council. Formerly called a &quot;disciplinary council&quot; or a &quot;church court&quot;, the councils were renamed to avoid focusing on guilt and instead to emphasize the availability of repentance.

The decision to withdraw the membership of a Melchizedek priesthood holder is generally the province of the leadership of a stake. In such a disciplinary council, the stake presidency and, sometimes in more difficult cases, the stake high council attend. It is possible to appeal a decision of a stake membership council to the church&#x27;s First Presidency.

For females and for male members not initiated into the Melchizedek priesthood, a ward membership council is held. In such cases, a bishop determines whether withdrawal of membership or a lesser sanction is warranted. He does this in consultation with his two counselors, with the bishop making the final determination after prayer. The decision of a ward membership council can be appealed to the stake president.

The following list of variables serves as a general set of guidelines for when membership withdrawal or lesser action may be warranted, beginning with those more likely to result in severe sanction:

#Violation of covenants: Covenants are made in conjunction with specific ordinances in the LDS Church. Violated covenants that might result in excommunication are usually those surrounding marriage covenants, temple covenants, and priesthood covenants.
#Position of trust or authority: The person&#x27;s position in the church hierarchy factors into the decision. It is considered more serious when a sin is committed by an area seventy; a stake, mission, or temple president; a bishop; a patriarch; or a full-time missionary.
#Repetition: Repetition of a sin is more serious than a single instance.
#Magnitude: How often, how many individuals were impacted, and who is aware of the sin factor into the decision.
#Age, maturity, and experience: Those who are young in age, or immature in their understanding, are typically afforded leniency.
#Interests of the innocent: How the discipline will impact innocent family members may be considered.
#Time between transgression and confession: If the sin was committed in the distant past, and there has not been repetition, leniency may be considered.
#Voluntary confession: If a person voluntarily confesses the sin, leniency is suggested.
#Evidence of repentance: Sorrow for sin, and demonstrated commitment to repentance, as well as faith in Jesus Christ all play a role in determining the severity of discipline.

Notices of withdrawal of membership may be made public, especially in cases of apostasy, where members could be misled. However, the specific reasons for individual withdrawal of membership are typically kept confidential and are seldom made public by church leadership.

Those who have their membership withdrawn lose the right to partake of the sacrament. Such persons are permitted to attend church meetings but participation is limited: they cannot offer public prayers, preach sermons, and cannot enter temples. Such individuals are also prohibited from wearing or purchasing temple garments and from paying tithes. A person whose membership has been withdrawn may be re-baptized after a waiting period of at least one year and sincere repentance, as judged by a series of interviews with church leaders.

Some critics have charged that LDS Church leaders have used the threat of membership withdrawal to silence or punish church members and researchers who disagree with established policy and doctrine, who study or discuss controversial subjects, or who may be involved in disputes with local, stake leaders or general authorities; see, e.g., Brian Evenson, a former BYU professor and writer whose fiction came under criticism from BYU officials and LDS Leadership. Another notable case of excommunication from the LDS Church was the &quot;September Six&quot;, a group of intellectuals and professors, five of whom were excommunicated and the sixth disfellowshipped. However, church policy dictates that local leaders are responsible for membership withdrawal, without influence from church headquarters. The church thus argues that this policy is evidence against any systematic persecution of scholars or dissenters. Data shows per-capita excommunication rates among the LDS Church have varied dramatically over the years, from a low of about 1 in 6,400 members in the early 1900s to one in 640 by the 1970s, an increase which has been speculatively attributed to &quot;informal guidance from above&quot; in enforcing the growing list of possible transgressions added to &quot;General Handbook&quot; editions over time.

=== Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses ===

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses practice a form of excommunication, using the term &quot;disfellowshipping&quot;, in cases where a member is believed to have unrepentantly committed one or more of several documented &quot;serious sins&quot;.

When a member confesses to, or is accused of, a &quot;serious sin&quot;, a &quot;judicial committee&quot; of at least three elders is formed. This committee investigates the case and determines the magnitude of the sin committed. If the person is deemed guilty of a disfellowshipping offense, the committee then decides, on the basis of the person&#x27;s attitude and &quot;works befitting repentance&quot;.

Disfellowshipping is a severing of friendly relationships between all Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and the disfellowshipped person. Interaction with extended family is typically restricted to a minimum, such as presence at the reading of wills and providing essential care for the elderly. Within a household, typical family contact may continue, but without spiritual fellowship such as family Bible study and religious discussions. Parents of disfellowshipped minors living in the family home may continue to attempt to convince the child about the group&#x27;s teachings. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that this form of discipline encourages the disfellowshipped individual to conform to biblical standards and prevents the person from influencing other members of the congregation.

Along with breaches of the Witnesses&#x27; moral code, openly disagreeing with the teachings of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses is considered grounds for shunning. These persons are labeled as &quot;apostates&quot; and are described in Watch Tower Society literature as &quot;mentally diseased&quot;. Descriptions of &quot;apostates&quot; appearing in the Witnesses literature have been the subject of investigation in the UK to determine if they violate religious hatred laws. Sociologist Andrew Holden claims many Witnesses who would otherwise defect because of disillusionment with the organization and its teachings, remain affiliated out of fear of being shunned and losing contact with friends and family members. Shunning employs what is known &quot;as relational aggression&quot; in psychological literature. When used by church members and member-spouse parents against excommunicant parents it contains elements of what psychologists call &quot;parental alienation&quot;. Extreme shunning may cause trauma to the shunned (and to their dependents) similar to what is studied in the psychology of torture.

Disassociation is a form of shunning where a member expresses verbally or in writing that they do not wish to be associated with Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, rather than for having committed any specific &#x27;sin&#x27;. Elders may also decide that an individual has disassociated, without any formal statement by the individual, by actions such as accepting a blood transfusion, or for joining another religious or military organization. Individuals who are deemed by the elders to have disassociated are given no right of appeal.

Each year, congregation elders are instructed to consider meeting with disfellowshipped individuals to determine changed circumstances and encourage them to pursue reinstatement. Reinstatement is not automatic after a certain time period, nor is there a minimum duration; disfellowshipped persons may talk to elders at any time but must apply in writing to be considered for reinstatement into the congregation. Elders consider each case individually, and are instructed to ensure &quot;that sufficient time has passed for the disfellowshipped person to prove that his profession of repentance is genuine&quot;. A judicial committee meets with the individual to determine their repentance, and if this is established, the person is reinstated into the congregation and may participate with the congregation in their formal ministry (such as house-to-house preaching).

A Witness who has been formally reproved or reinstated cannot be appointed to any &quot;special privilege of service&quot; for at least one year. Serious sins involving child sex abuse permanently disqualify the sinner from appointment to any congregational &quot;privilege of service&quot;, regardless of whether the sinner was convicted of any secular crime.

===Christadelphians===
Similarly to many groups having their origins in the 1830s Restoration Movement, Christadelphians call their form of excommunication &quot;disfellowshipping&quot;, though they do not practice &quot;shunning&quot;. Disfellowshipping can occur for moral reasons, changing beliefs, or (in some ecclesias) for not attending communion (referred to as &quot;the emblems&quot; or &quot;the breaking of bread&quot;).

In such cases, the person involved is usually required to discuss the issues. If they do not conform, the church (&#x27;meeting&#x27; or &#x27;ecclesia&#x27;) is recommended by the management committee (&quot;Arranging Brethren&quot;) to vote on disfellowshipping the person. These procedures were formulated 1863 onwards by early Christadelphians, and then in 1883 codified by Robert Roberts in &quot;A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias&quot; (colloquially &quot;The Ecclesial Guide&quot;). However Christadelphians justify and apply their practice not only from this document but also from passages such as the exclusion in 1Co.5 and recovery in 2Co.2.

Christadelphians typically avoid the term &quot;excommunication&quot; which many associate with the Catholic Church; and may feel the word carries implications they do not agree with, such as undue condemnation and punishment, as well as failing to recognise the remedial intention of the measure.

* Behavioural cases. Many cases regarding moral issues tend to involve relational matters such as marriage outside the faith, divorce and remarriage (which is considered adultery in some circumstances by some ecclesias), or homosexuality. Reinstatement for moral issues is determined by the ecclesia&#x27;s assessment of whether the individual has &quot;turned away&quot; from (ceased) the course of action considered immoral by the church. This can be complex when dealing with cases of divorce and subsequent remarriage, with different positions adopted by different ecclesias, but generally within the main &quot;Central&quot; grouping, such cases can be accommodated.
* Doctrinal cases. Changes of belief on what Christadelphians call &quot;first principle&quot; doctrines are difficult to accommodate unless the individual agrees to not teach or spread them, since the body has a documented Statement of Faith which informally serves as a basis of ecclesial membership and interecclesial fellowship. Those who are disfellowshipped for reasons of differing belief rarely return, because they are expected to conform to an understanding with which they do not agree. Holding differing beliefs on fundamental matters is considered as error and apostasy, which can limit a person&#x27;s salvation. However, in practice disfellowship for doctrinal reasons is now unusual.

In the case of adultery and divorce, the passage of time usually means a member can be restored if he or she wants to be. In the case of ongoing behaviour, cohabitation, homosexual activity, then the terms of the suspension have not been met.

The mechanics of &quot;refellowship&quot; follow the reverse of the original process; the individual makes an application to the &quot;ecclesia&quot;, and the &quot;Arranging Brethren&quot; give a recommendation to the members who vote. If the &quot;Arranging Brethren&quot; judge that a vote may divide the ecclesia, or personally upset some members, they may seek to find a third party ecclesia which is willing to &quot;refellowship&quot; the member instead. According to the Ecclesial Guide a third party ecclesia may also take the initiative to &quot;refellowship&quot; another meeting&#x27;s member. However this cannot be done unilaterally, as this would constitute heteronomy over the autonomy of the original ecclesia&#x27;s members.

===Society of Friends (Quakers)===
Among many of the Society of Friends (Quakers) groups one is &quot;read out of meeting&quot; for behaviour inconsistent with the sense of the meeting. In Britain a meeting may record a minute of disunity. However it is the responsibility of each meeting, quarterly meeting, and yearly meeting, to act with respect to their own members. For example, during the Vietnam War many Friends were concerned about Friend Richard Nixon&#x27;s position on war which seemed at odds with their beliefs; however, it was the responsibility of Nixon&#x27;s own meeting, the East Whittier Meeting of Whittier, California, to act if indeed that meeting felt the leading. They did not.

In 17th- and 18th-Century North America, before the founding of abolitionist societies, Friends who too forcefully tried to convince their coreligionists of the evils of slavery were read out of meeting. Benjamin Lay was read out of the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting for this. During the American Revolution over 400 Friends were read out of meeting for their military participation or support.

===Iglesia ni Cristo===
 practices expulsion of members it deems to have gravely sinned or gone against the teachings and doctrines of the church. The Sanggunian, the church&#x27;s council, has jurisdiction to expel members from the church. People expelled by the church are referred to as &quot;dismissed&quot; (). Offenses that may be grounds for expulsion include marrying a non-member, having a romantic relationship with a non-member, becoming pregnant out of wedlock (unless the couple marries before the child is born) and most especially disagreeing with the church administration. An expelled member can be re-admitted by pledging obedience to the church administration and its rules, values and teachings.

== Unitarian Universalism ==
Unitarian Universalism, being a liberal religious group and a congregational denomination, has a wide diversity of opinions and sentiments. Nonetheless, Unitarian Universalists have had to deal with disruptive individuals. Congregations which had no policies on disruptive individuals have sometimes found themselves having to create such policies, up to (and including) expulsion.

By the late 1990s, several churches were using the West Shore UU Church&#x27;s policy as a model. If someone is threatening, disruptive, or distracting from the appeal of the church to its membership, a church using this model has three recommended levels of response to the offending individual. While the first level involves dialogue between a committee or clergy member and the offender, the second and third levels involve expulsion, either from the church itself or a church activity.

== Buddhism ==

There is no direct equivalent to excommunication in Buddhism. However, in the Theravadan monastic community monks can be expelled from monasteries for heresy or other acts. In addition, monks have four vows, called the four defeats, which are abstaining from sexual intercourse, stealing, murder, and lying about spiritual gains (e.g., having special power or ability to perform miracles). If any one is broken, the monk is automatically a layman again and can never become a monk in his or her current life.

Most Japanese Buddhist sects hold ecclesiastical authority over their followers and have their own rules for expelling members of the sangha, lay or bishopric. The lay Japanese Buddhist organization Sōka Gakkai was expelled from the Nichiren Shoshu sect in 1991.

== Hinduism ==
Hinduism is too diverse to be seen as a homogenous and monolithic religion. It is often described an unorganised and syncretist religion with a conspicuous absence of any listed doctrines. There are multiple religious institutions (equivalent to Christian ecclesia) within Hinduism that teach slight variations of Dharma and Karma, hence Hinduism has no concept of excommunication and hence no Hindu may be ousted from the Hindu religion, though a person may easily lose caste status through gramanya for a very wide variety of infringements of caste prohibitions. This may or may not be recoverable. However, some of the modern organised sects within Hinduism may practice something equivalent to excommunication today, by ousting a person from their own sect.

In medieval and early-modern times (and sometimes even now) in South Asia, excommunication from one&#x27;s &quot;caste&quot; (&quot;jāti&quot; or &quot;varna&quot;) used to be practiced (by the caste-councils) and was often with serious consequences, such as abasement of the person&#x27;s caste status and even throwing him into the sphere of the untouchables or bhangi. In the 19th century, a Hindu faced excommunication for going abroad, since it was presumed he/she would be forced to break caste restrictions and, as a result, become polluted.

After excommunication, it would depend upon the caste-council whether they would accept any form of repentance (ritual or otherwise) or not. Such current examples of excommunication in Hinduism are often more political or social rather than religious, for example the excommunication of lower castes for refusing to work as scavengers in Tamil Nadu.

Another example of caste-related violence and discrimination occurred in the case of the Gupti Ismailis from the Hindu Kachhiya caste. Interestingly, Hindu members of this caste began prayers with the inclusion of the mantra “OM, by the command, in the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful” (&quot;om farmānjī bi’smi’l-lāh al-raḥmān al-raḥīm&quot;), but never found it objectionable or Islamic. However, in the early 1930s, after some conflict with caste members due to their profession of allegiance to the Ismaili Imam, this group, known as the Guptis, were excommunicated from the caste completely as they appeared to be breaking caste solidarity. This was also significant for the Gupti community as, for the first time, they could be identified as a distinct group based on their religious persuasion. Some of the more daring Guptis also abandoned their former practice of pious circumspection (&quot;taqiyya&quot;) as Hindus, claiming that since they had been excommunicated, the caste no longer had any jurisdiction over their actions.

An earlier example of excommunication in Hinduism is that of Shastri Yagnapurushdas, who voluntarily left and was later expelled from the Vadtal Gadi of the Swaminarayan Sampraday by the then Vadtal acharya in 1906. He went on to form his own institution, &quot;Bochasanwasi Swaminarayan Sanstha&quot; or &quot;BSS&quot; (now BAPS) claiming Gunatitanand Swami was the rightful spiritual successor to Swaminarayan.

== Sikhism ==
&quot;Patit&quot; is a Sikh term which is sometimes translated into English as apostate. It refers to a person who initiated into Sikh religion, but violated the religious rules of Sikhi. The Sikh Rehat Maryada (Code of Conduct), Section Six states the transgressions which cause a person to become a &quot;patit&quot;:

* Dishonouring the hair;
* Eating the meat of an animal slaughtered the Kutha way;
* Cohabiting with a person other than one&#x27;s spouse;
* Using an intoxicant (such as smoking, drinking alcohol, using recreational drugs or tobacco)

These four kurahit causes of apostasy were first listed by Guru Gobind Singh in his 52 hukams (commandments).

== Islam ==

Since there has been no universally and univocally recognized religious authority among the many Islamic denominations that have emerged throughout history, papal excommunication has no exact equivalent in Islam, at least insofar as the attitudes of any conflicting religious authorities with regard to an individual or another sect are judged to be coordinate, not subordinate to one another. Nonetheless, condemning heterodoxy and punishing heretics through shunning and ostracism is comparable with the practice in non-Catholic Christian faiths.

Islamic theologians commonly employ two terms when describing measurements to be taken against schismatics and heresy: (&quot;hajr&quot;, &quot;abandoning&quot;) and (&quot;takfīr&quot;, &quot;making or declaring to be a nonbeliever&quot;). The former (هَجْر, &quot;hajr&quot;) signifies the act of abandoning somewhere (such as migration, as in the Islamic prophet&#x27;s journey out of Mecca, which is called al-Hijra (&quot;the (e)migration&quot;)) or someone (used in the Qur&#x27;an in the case of disciplining a dissonant or disobedient wife or avoiding a harmful person). The latter (تَكْفِير, &quot;takfīr&quot;) means a definitive declaration that denounces a person as a kāfir (&quot;infidel&quot;). However, because such a charge would entail serious consequences for the accused, who would then be deemed to be a (&quot;murtadd&quot;, &quot;a backslider; an apostate), less extreme denunciations, such as an accusation of (&quot;bidʽah&quot;, &quot;[deviant] innovation; heresy&quot;) followed by shunning and excommunication have historically preponderated over apostasy trials.

&quot;Takfīr&quot; has often been practiced through the courts. More recently, cases have taken place where individuals have been considered nonbelievers. These decisions followed lawsuits against individuals, mainly in response to their writings that some have viewed as anti-Islamic. The most famous cases are of Salman Rushdie, Nasr Abu Zayd, Nawal El-Saadawi, and of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. The repercussions of such cases have included divorce, since under traditional interpretations of Islamic law, Muslim women are not permitted to marry non-Muslim men.

== Judaism ==
&quot;Herem&quot; is the highest ecclesiastical censure in Judaism. It is the total exclusion of a person from the Jewish community. Except for cases in the Charedi community, &quot;cherem&quot; stopped existing after The Enlightenment, when local Jewish communities lost their political autonomy, and Jews were integrated into the gentile nations in which they lived. A &quot;siruv&quot; order, equivalent to a contempt of court, issued by a Rabbinical court may also limit religious participation.

Rabbinical conferences of movements do expel members from time to time, but sometimes choose the lesser penalty of censuring the offending rabbi. Between 2010 and 2015, the Reform Jewish Central Conference of American Rabbis expelled six rabbis, the Orthodox Jewish Rabbinical Council of America expelled three, and the Conservative Jewish Rabbinical Assembly expelled one, suspended three, and caused one to resign without eligibility for reinstatement. While the CCAR and RCA were relatively shy about their reasons for expelling rabbis, the RA was more open about its reasons for kicking rabbis out. Reasons for expulsion from the three conferences include sexual misconduct, failure to comply with ethics investigations, setting up conversion groups without the conference&#x27;s approval, stealing money from congregations, other financial misconduct, and getting arrested.

Judaism, like Unitarian Universalism, tends towards congregationalism, and so decisions to exclude from a community of worship often depend on the congregation. Congregational bylaws sometimes enable the board of a synagogue to ask individuals to leave or not to enter.

<text>An electrochemical cell is a device that generates electrical energy from chemical reactions. Electrical energy can also be applied to these cells to cause chemical reactions to occur. Electrochemical cells that generate an electric current are called voltaic or galvanic cells and those that generate chemical reactions, via electrolysis for example, are called electrolytic cells.

Both galvanic and electrolytic cells can be thought of as having two half-cells: consisting of separate oxidation and reduction reactions.

When one or more electrochemical cells are connected in parallel or series they make a battery. Primary cells are single use batteries.

== Types of electrochemical cells ==

=== Galvanic cell ===

A galvanic cell (voltaic cell), named after Luigi Galvani (Alessandro Volta), is an electrochemical cell that generates electrical energy from spontaneous redox reactions.

A wire connects two different metals (e.g. zinc and copper). Each metal is in a separate solution; often the aqueous sulphate or nitrate forms of the metal, however more generally metal salts and water which conduct current. A salt bridge or porous membrane connects the two solutions, keeping electric neutrality and the avoidance of charge accumulation. The metal&#x27;s differences in oxidation/reduction potential drive the reaction until equilibrium.

Key features:
* spontaneous reaction
* generates electric current
* current flows through a wire, and ions flow through a salt bridge
* anode (negative), cathode (positive)

==== Half cells ====
Galvanic cells consists of two half-cells. Each half-cell consists of an electrode and an electrolyte (both half-cells may use the same or different electrolytes).

The chemical reactions in the cell involve the electrolyte, electrodes, and/or an external substance (fuel cells may use hydrogen gas as a reactant). In a full electrochemical cell, species from one half-cell lose electrons (oxidation) to their electrode while species from the other half-cell gain electrons (reduction) from their electrode.

A &quot;salt bridge&quot; (e.g., filter paper soaked in KNO3, NaCl, or some other electrolyte) is used to ionically connect two half-cells with different electrolytes, but it prevents the solutions from mixing and unwanted side reactions. An alternative to a salt bridge is to allow direct contact (and mixing) between the two half-cells, for example in simple electrolysis of water.

As electrons flow from one half-cell to the other through an external circuit, a difference in charge is established. If no ionic contact were provided, this charge difference would quickly prevent the further flow of electrons. A salt bridge allows the flow of negative or positive ions to maintain a steady-state charge distribution between the oxidation and reduction vessels, while keeping the contents otherwise separate. Other devices for achieving separation of solutions are porous pots and gelled solutions. A porous pot is used in the Bunsen cell.

==== Equilibrium reaction ====
Each half-cell has a characteristic voltage (depending on the metal and its characteristic reduction potential). Each reaction is undergoing an equilibrium reaction between different oxidation states of the ions: when equilibrium is reached, the cell cannot provide further voltage. In the half-cell performing oxidation, the closer the equilibrium lies to the ion/atom with the more positive oxidation state the more potential this reaction will provide. Likewise, in the reduction reaction, the closer the equilibrium lies to the ion/atom with the more &quot;negative&quot; oxidation state the higher the potential.

==== Cell potential ====
The cell potential can be predicted through the use of electrode potentials (the voltages of each half-cell). These half-cell potentials are defined relative to the assignment of 0 volts to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). (See table of standard electrode potentials). The difference in voltage between electrode potentials gives a prediction for the potential measured. When calculating the difference in voltage, one must first rewrite the half-cell reaction equations to obtain a balanced oxidation-reduction equation.

# Reverse the reduction reaction with the smallest potential (to create an oxidation reaction/overall positive cell potential)
# Half-reactions must be multiplied by integers to achieve electron balance.

Cell potentials have a possible range of roughly zero to 6 volts. Cells using water-based electrolytes are usually limited to cell potentials less than about 2.5 volts due to high reactivity of the powerful oxidizing and reducing agents with water which is needed to produce a higher voltage. Higher cell potentials are possible with cells using other solvents instead of water. For instance, lithium cells with a voltage of 3 volts are commonly available.

The cell potential depends on the concentration of the reactants, as well as their type. As the cell is discharged, the concentration of the reactants decreases and the cell potential also decreases.

=== Electrolytic cell ===

An electrolytic cell is an electrochemical cell in which applied electrical energy drives a non-spontaneous redox reaction.

They are often used to decompose chemical compounds, in a process called electrolysis. (The Greek word &quot;&quot; (λύσις) means &quot;loosing&quot; or &quot;setting free&quot;.)

Important examples of electrolysis are the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen, and of bauxite into aluminium and other chemicals. Electroplating (e.g. of Copper, Silver, Nickel or Chromium) is done using an electrolytic cell. Electrolysis is a technique that uses a direct electric current (DC).

The components of an electrolytic cell are:
* an electrolyte: usually a solution of water or other solvents in which ions are dissolved. Molten salts such as sodium chloride are also electrolytes.
* two electrodes (a cathode and an anode) which are electrical terminals consisting of a suitable substance at which oxidation or reduction can take place, and maintained at two different electric potentials.

When driven by an external voltage (potential difference) applied to the electrodes, the ions in the electrolyte are attracted to the electrode with the opposite potential, where charge-transferring (also called faradaic or redox) reactions can take place. Only with a sufficient external voltage can an electrolytic cell decompose a normally stable, or inert chemical compound in the solution. Thus the electrical energy provided produces a chemical reaction which would not occur spontaneously otherwise.Key features:
* non-spontaneous reaction
* generates current
* current flows through a wire, and ions flow through salt bridge
* anode (positive), cathode (negative)

=== Primary cell ===

A primary cell produces current by irreversible chemical reactions (ex. small disposable batteries) and is not rechargeable.

They are used for their portability, low cost, and short lifetime.

Primary cells are made in a range of standard sizes to power small household appliances such as flashlights and portable radios.

As chemical reactions proceed in a primary cell, the battery uses up the chemicals that generate the power; when they are gone, the battery stops producing electricity.
Primary batteries make up about 90% of the $50 billion battery market, but secondary batteries have been gaining market share. About 15 billion primary batteries are thrown away worldwide every year, virtually all ending up in landfills. Due to the toxic heavy metals and strong acids or alkalis they contain, batteries are hazardous waste. Most municipalities classify them as such and require separate disposal. The energy needed to manufacture a battery is about 50 times greater than the energy it contains. Due to their high pollutant content compared to their small energy content, the primary battery is considered a wasteful, environmentally unfriendly technology. Mainly due to the increasing sales of wireless devices and cordless tools, which cannot be economically powered by primary batteries and come with integral rechargeable batteries, the secondary battery industry has high growth and has slowly been replacing the primary battery in high end products.

=== Secondary cell ===

A secondary cell produces current by reversible chemical reactions (ex. lead-acid battery car battery) and is rechargeable.

Lead-acid batteries are used in an automobile to start an engine and to operate the car&#x27;s electrical accessories when the engine is not running. The alternator, once the car is running, recharges the battery.

It can perform as a galvanic cell and an electrolytic cell. It is a convenient way to store electricity: when current flows one way, the levels of one or more chemicals build up (charging); while it is discharging, they reduce and the resulting electromotive force can do work.

They are used for their high voltage, low costs, reliability, and long lifetime.

=== Fuel cell ===
A fuel cell is an electrochemical cell that reacts hydrogen fuel with oxygen or another oxidizing agent, to convert chemical energy to electricity.

Fuel cells are different from batteries in requiring a continuous source of fuel and oxygen (usually from air) to sustain the chemical reaction, whereas in a battery the chemical energy comes from chemicals already present in the battery.

Fuel cells can produce electricity continuously for as long as fuel and oxygen are supplied.

They are used for primary and backup power for commercial, industrial and residential buildings and in remote or inaccessible areas. They are also used to power fuel cell vehicles, including forklifts, automobiles, buses, boats, motorcycles and submarines.

Fuel cells are classified by the type of electrolyte they use and by the difference in startup time, which ranges from 1 second for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEM fuel cells, or PEMFC) to 10 minutes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).

There are many types of fuel cells, but they all consist of:

;anode: At the anode a catalyst causes the fuel to undergo oxidation reactions that generate protons (positively charged hydrogen ions) and electrons. The protons flow from the anode to the cathode through the electrolyte after the reaction. At the same time, electrons are drawn from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit, producing direct current electricity.
;cathode: At the cathode, another catalyst causes hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen to react, forming water.
;electrolyte: Allows positively charged hydrogen ions (protons) to move between the two sides of the fuel cell.

A related technology are flow batteries, in which the fuel can be regenerated by recharging. Individual fuel cells produce relatively small electrical potentials, about 0.7 volts, so cells are &quot;stacked&quot;, or placed in series, to create sufficient voltage to meet an application&#x27;s requirements. In addition to electricity, fuel cells produce water, heat and, depending on the fuel source, very small amounts of nitrogen dioxide and other emissions. The energy efficiency of a fuel cell is generally between 40 and 60%; however, if waste heat is captured in a cogeneration scheme, efficiencies up to 85% can be obtained.

In 2022, the global fuel cell market was estimated to be $6.3 billion, and is expected to increase by 19.9% by 2030. Many countries are attempting to enter the market by setting renewable energy GW goals.

<doc id="10340" wikidata="Q13389887" url="?curid=10340" title="Ecdysis">
<text>Ecdysis is the moulting of the cuticle in many invertebrates of the clade Ecdysozoa. Since the cuticle of these animals typically forms a largely inelastic exoskeleton, it is shed during growth and a new, larger covering is formed. The remnants of the old, empty exoskeleton are called exuviae.

After moulting, an arthropod is described as &quot;teneral&quot;, a &quot;callow&quot;; it is &quot;fresh&quot;, pale and soft-bodied. Within one or two hours, the cuticle hardens and darkens following a tanning process analogous to the production of leather. During this short phase the animal expands, since growth is otherwise constrained by the rigidity of the exoskeleton. Growth of the limbs and other parts normally covered by the hard exoskeleton is achieved by transfer of body fluids from soft parts before the new skin hardens. A spider with a small abdomen may be undernourished but more probably has recently undergone ecdysis. Some arthropods, especially large insects with tracheal respiration, expand their new exoskeleton by swallowing or otherwise taking in air. The maturation of the structure and colouration of the new exoskeleton might take days or weeks in a long-lived insect; this can make it difficult to identify an individual if it has recently undergone ecdysis.

Ecdysis allows damaged tissue and missing limbs to be regenerated or substantially re-formed. Complete regeneration may require a series of moults, the stump becoming a little larger with each moult until the limb is a normal, or near normal, size.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;ecdysis&quot; comes from Ancient Greek () &#x27;to take off, strip off&#x27;.

==Process==

In preparation for ecdysis, the arthropod becomes inactive for a period of time, undergoing apolysis or separation of the old exoskeleton from the underlying epidermal cells. For most organisms, the resting period is a stage of preparation during which the secretion of fluid from the moulting glands of the epidermal layer and the loosening of the underpart of the cuticle occurs.
Once the old cuticle has separated from the epidermis, a digesting fluid is secreted into the space between them. However, this fluid remains inactive until the upper part of the new cuticle has been formed. Then, by crawling movements, the organism pushes forward in the old integumentary shell, which splits down the back allowing the animal to emerge. Often, this initial crack is caused by a combination of movement and increase in pressure of hemolymph within the body, forcing an expansion across its exoskeleton, leading to an eventual crack that allows for certain organisms such as spiders to extricate themselves.
While the old cuticle is being digested, the new layer is secreted. All cuticular structures are shed at ecdysis, including the inner parts of the exoskeleton, which includes terminal linings of the alimentary tract and of the tracheae if they are present.
==Insects==
Each stage of development between moults for insects in the taxon Endopterygota is called an instar, or stadium, and each stage between moults of insects in the Exopterygota is called a nymph: there may be up to 15 nymphal stages. Endopterygota tend to have only four or five instars. Endopterygotes have more alternatives to moulting, such as expansion of the cuticle and collapse of air sacs to allow growth of internal organs.

The process of moulting in insects begins with the separation of the cuticle from the underlying epidermal cells (apolysis) and ends with the shedding of the old cuticle (ecdysis). In many species it is initiated by an increase in the hormone ecdysone. This hormone causes:
* apolysis – the separation of the cuticle from the epidermis
* secretion of new cuticle materials beneath the old
* degradation of the old cuticle

After apolysis the insect is known as a pharate. Moulting fluid is then secreted into the exuvial space between the old cuticle and the epidermis, this contains inactive enzymes which are activated only after the new epicuticle is secreted. This prevents the new procuticle from getting digested as it is laid down. The lower regions of the old cuticle, the endocuticle and mesocuticle, are then digested by the enzymes and subsequently absorbed. The exocuticle and epicuticle resist digestion and are hence shed at ecdysis.

==Spiders==

Spiders generally change their skin for the first time while still inside the egg sac, and the spiderling that emerges broadly resembles the adult. The number of moults varies, both between species and sexes, but generally will be between five times and nine times before the spider reaches maturity. Not surprisingly, since males are generally smaller than females, the males of many species mature faster and do not undergo ecdysis as many times as the females before maturing.
Members of the Mygalomorphae are very long-lived, sometimes 20 years or more; they moult annually even after they mature.

Spiders stop feeding at some time before moulting, usually for several days. The physiological processes of releasing the old exoskeleton from the tissues beneath typically cause various colour changes, such as darkening. If the old exoskeleton is not too thick it may be possible to see new structures, such as setae, from the outside. However, contact between the nerves and the old exoskeleton is maintained until a very late stage in the process.

The new, teneral exoskeleton has to accommodate a larger frame than the previous instar, while the spider has had to fit into the previous exoskeleton until it has been shed. This means the spider does not fill out the new exoskeleton completely, so it commonly appears somewhat wrinkled.
Most species of spiders hang from silk during the entire process, either dangling from a drop line, or fastening their claws into webbed fibres attached to a suitable base. The discarded, dried exoskeleton typically remains hanging where it was abandoned once the spider has left.
To open the old exoskeleton, the spider generally contracts its abdomen (opisthosoma) to supply enough fluid to pump into the prosoma with sufficient pressure to crack it open along its lines of weakness. The carapace lifts off from the front, like a helmet, as its surrounding skin ruptures, but it remains attached at the back. Now the spider works its limbs free and typically winds up dangling by a new thread of silk attached to its own exuviae, which in turn hang from the original silk attachment.
At this point the spider is a callow; it is teneral and vulnerable. As it dangles, its exoskeleton hardens and takes shape. The process may take minutes in small spiders, or some hours in the larger Mygalomorphs. Some spiders, such as some &quot;Synema&quot; species, members of the Thomisidae (crab spiders), mate while the female is still callow, during which time she is unable to eat the male.

==Eurypterids==
Eurypterids are a group of chelicerates that became extinct in the Late Permian. They underwent ecdysis similarly to extant chelicerates, and most fossils are thought to be of exuviae, rather than cadavers.

<text>Ebor is a village on Waterfall Way on the Northern Tablelands in New South Wales, Australia. It is situated about east of Armidale and about a third of the way between Armidale and the coast. Dorrigo to the east is away with the Coffs Coast away along Waterfall Way. In the , Ebor&#x27;s zone had a population of 149.

==History==
The village is situated in the traditional lands of the Gumbaynggirr peoples.

Ebor shares its name with a nearby set of waterfalls, Ebor Falls, which is a local tourist attraction. Gumbaynggirr people traditionally called the falls &quot;Martiam&quot; (meaning &#x27;the great falls&#x27;).

The village&#x27;s wooden Catholic church burned down in October 1946.

At the , Ebor had a population of 149 people.

==Borderlands==
Although &quot;The Heart of Waterfall Way&quot;, Ebor is on the eastern edge of Armidale Regional Council, and close to the border of Clarence Valley Council and Bellingen Shire Council. Until the amalgamation of Guyra and Armidale councils, one side of Ebor was under Armidale council, and the other under Guyra shire. Likewise, Ebor is close to three state electoral districts (Northern Tablelands, Oxley and Clarence) and three federal electoral boundaries (New England, Cowper and Page).

==Facilities==
Amenities in the area include a cafe, a combined post office, fuel station and general store, a pub/motel with camp ground, and a NSW DEC primary school. The local sports ground is home of the Ebor Campdraft.

There are also Rural Fire Service and National Parks and Wildlife Service depots in the area, but no police or ambulance services based in Ebor. The nearest hospital and 24h emergency department is in Dorrigo.

== Features==
Due to its central position on Waterfall Way, Ebor offers easy access for residents and tourists to Guy Fawkes River National Park, Cathedral Rock National Park, Cunnawarra National Park, New England National Park, part of Oxley Wild Rivers National Park, Nymboi-Binderay National Park and Mount Hyland Nature Reserve.

The natural environment of the surrounding district includes several areas which have been cleared for pastoralism and forestry. Nonetheless, the national parks around Ebor have been described as a bush walking &quot;Mecca&quot;. The main tourist attraction is the twin Ebor Falls.

In 1930 Sydney Smith Jr. wrote that: &quot;During a recent visit to Ebor I was much impressed with the possibilities of this part of the State as a tourist resort... Around Ebor and Guy Fawkes can be seen some of the most magnificent scenery in this State if not Australia. ...The two falls are scenes of beauty, and in winter time are sometimes frozen, making a beautiful spectacle as they hang in huge icicles. The water from the Ebor eventually finds an outlet in the Clarence River. ...The view, ...as regards expansiveness, ruggedness, and beauty, must compare more than favourably with views of a similar nature in any part of the Commonwealth. It reminded me of the Valley of a Thousand Hills, outside Durban, in South Africa&quot;.

In 1976, local historian Eric Fahey also wrote: &quot;I believe the future of Dorrigo will depend largely on tourism. The area has a lot to offer, both in peerless scenery and because of the native fauna which can be seen in large numbers in their natural state.&quot;

Wagyu beef specialists Stone Axe have a large holding, &quot;Glen Alvie&quot;, on the northern boundary of the village. Stone Axe also acquired &quot;Alfreda&quot; in the nearby locality of Wongwibinda.

Black truffles (tuber melanosporum) are grown at the Guy Fawkes Truffle Company outside of Ebor on the Guyra Rd.

Trout are another local product. The Dutton Trout Hatchery on Point Lookout Road was established in 1950 and is one of the largest hatcheries in the state. Visitors can see the various stages of trout development prior to their release in the mountain streams. The release of trout into local streams is believed to have led to decline of the endangered Tusked frog.

There are two short walks close to the village. One takes walkers through the recreation reserve. This walk follows the Guy Fawkes River upstream for about half of the walk. Some bird life can be seen. The second walk is accessed by crossing the Guy Fawkes River bridge, and following the pedestrian path that winds downstream under the bridge. This path follows the Guy Fawkes River north and meets the national park&#x27;s Upper and Lower Falls paths. Wallabies, kangaroos, bird life and fire-flies can be seen depending on the season. Platypus have also been sighted in August in the pool above the falls.

The Bicentennial National Trail (BNT) passes through Ebor, which sits on the boundary of sections 7 and 8 of the BNT.

The Ebor Falls area is sometimes used for rock climbing, and is described as &quot;holding a rather special place in the History of New England climbing&quot;.

==Speeding and traffic==
Ebor has a noted problem with speeding vehicles. Both passenger cars and heavy vehicles regularly exceed the posted speed limit of 50 km/h. Traffic noise is also a problem. Waterfall Way has an entry on the Dangerous Roads website.

==Post office==
Ebor&#x27;s Post Office opened on 2 March 1868, closed in 1869 and reopened in 1910. It is currently located at the Ebor petrol station/store having moved from Fusspots Cafe.

== Cultural heritage==
Ebor has a number of cultural heritage sites, including several Aboriginal meeting places, and massacre sites.

&quot;Gwenda Gardens&quot; is an abandoned homestead on the Guyra-Ebor Road.

Other sites include:
* Waterfall Way: Yooroonah Tank Barrier
* Former Cottage Hospital at 5 Parke Street
* Ebor Cemetery off Waterfall Way
* Deconsecrated Union Church at 11608 Waterfall Way
* Former Ebor Soldiers Hall at 11626 Waterfall Way
* Former Australian Bank of Commerce (formerly City Bank of Sydney) at 27 Ebor Street
* Homestead, &quot;Milamba&quot; (including original Guy Fawkes Post Office and sheep dip) at 7122 Grafton Road
* House, &quot;Kotupna&quot; at 7314 Grafton Road
* Cement weir at 337 Point Lookout Road

==Climate==
The village of Ebor is at high altitude by Australian standards. It has cold winters with frequent overnight frost and occasional light snow falls. The average rain fall is about .

<text>The ancient history of Afghanistan, also referred to as the pre-Islamic period of Afghanistan, dates back to the prehistoric era and the [[Helmand culture|Helmand civilization]] around 3300–2350 BCE. Archaeological exploration began in Afghanistan in earnest after World War II and proceeded until the late 1970s during the Soviet–Afghan War. Archaeologists and historians suggest that humans were living in Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities of the region were among the earliest in the world. Urbanized culture has existed in the land from between 3000 and 2000 BC. Artifacts typical of the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron ages have been found inside Afghanistan.

After the Indus Valley civilization stretched up to northeast Afghanistan, it was inhabited by the Iranic tribes and controlled by the Medes until about 500 BC when Darius the Great (Darius I) marched with his Persian army to make it part of the Achaemenid Empire. In 330 BC, Alexander the Great of Macedonia invaded the land after defeating Darius III of Persia in the Battle of Gaugamela. Much of Afghanistan became part of the Seleucid Empire followed by the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. Seleucus I Nicator was defeated by Chandragupta Maurya and gave his daughter in a peace treaty. The land was inhabited by various tribes and ruled by many different kingdoms for the next two millenniums. Before the arrival of Islam in the 7th century, there were a number of religions practiced in modern-day Afghanistan. Zoroastrianism and Ancient Iranian religions were practiced is western Afganistan (Khorasan and Herat). Hinduism and Buddhism was primarily practiced in regions of Eastern (Kabul) and South-Eastern Afganistan (Kandahar).The Kafiristan (present-day Nuristan) region, in the Hindu Kush mountain range, was not converted until the 19th century. They still follow the ancient Vedic religion (related to modern day Hinduism).

==Prehistoric era==
Louis Dupree, the University of Pennsylvania, the Smithsonian Institution and others suggest that humans were living in Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities of the region were among the earliest in the world.
Afghanistan seems in prehistory, as well as in ancient and modern times, to have been connected by culture and trade with the neighbouring regions. Urban civilization may have begun as early as 3000 to 2000 BC. Archaeological finds indicate the possible beginnings of the Bronze Age, which would ultimately spread throughout the ancient world from Afghanistan. It is also believed that the region had early trade contacts with Mesopotamia.

===Indus Valley civilization===

The Indus Valley civilization (IVC) was a Bronze Age civilization (3300–1300 BCE; mature period 2600–1900 BCE) extending from what today is northwest Pakistan to northwest India and northeast Afghanistan. An Indus Valley site has been found on the Oxus River at Shortugai in northern Afghanistan. Apart from Shortughai is Mundigak, another notable site. There are several smaller IVC colonies to be found in Afghanistan.

==Aryan expansion into Mesopotamia and the Medean rule (1500 BC–551 BC)==

Between 2000–1200 BC, a branch of Indo-European-speaking tribes known as the Aryans began migrating into the region. This is part of a dispute in regards to the Indo-Aryan migration. They split into Iranic peoples, Nuristani, and Indo-Aryan groups at an early stage, possibly between 1500 and 1000 BC in what is today Afghanistan or much earlier as eastern remnants of the Indo-Aryans drifted much further west as with the Mitanni. The Iranians dominated the modern day plateau, while the Indo-Aryans ultimately headed towards the Indian subcontinent. The Avesta is believed to have been composed possibly as early as 1800 BC and written in ancient Ariana (Aryana), the earliest name of Afghanistan which indicates an early link with today&#x27;s Iranian tribes to the west, or adjacent regions in Central Asia or northeastern Iran in the 6th century BC. Due to the similarity between early Avestan and Sanskrit (and other related early Indo-European languages such as Latin and Ancient Greek), it is believed that the split between the old Persians and Indo-Aryan tribes had taken place at least by 1000 BC. There are striking similarities between Avestan and Sanskrit, which may support the notion that the split was contemporary with the Indo-Aryans living in Afghanistan at a very early stage. Also, the Avesta itself divides into Old and New sections and neither mention the Medes who are known to have ruled Afghanistan starting around 700 BC. This suggests an early time-frame for the Avesta that has yet to be exactly determined as most academics believe it was written over the course of centuries if not millennia. Much of the archaeological data comes from the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC and Indus Valley civilization) that probably played a key role in early Aryanic civilization in Afghanistan.
The Indo-Aryan inhabitants of the region- mainly in the southern and eastern parts of the country were adherents of Hinduism. Notable among these were the Gandharis
The Pashayi and Nuristanis are present day examples of these Indo-Iranian people.

The Medes, a Western Iranian people, arrived from what is today Kurdistan sometime around the 700s BC and came to dominate most of ancient Afghanistan. They were an early tribe that forged the first empire on the present Iranian plateau and sister-nations with the Persians whom they initially dominated in the province of Fars to the south. Median control of parts of far off Afghanistan would last until Cyrus the Great, prince of the Persians, assassinated and ultimately replaced his Median emperor father-in-law from rule.

==Achaemenid invasion and Zoroastrianism (550 BC–331 BC)==
The city of Bactra (which later became Balkh), is believed to have been the home of Zarathustra, who founded the Zoroastrian religion. The Avesta refers to eastern Bactria as being the home of the Zoroastrian faith. Regardless of the debate as to where Zoroaster was from, Zoroastrianism spread to become one of the world&#x27;s most influential religions and became the main faith of the old Aryan people for centuries. It also remained the official religion of Persia until the defeat of the Sassanian ruler Yazdegerd III—over a thousand years after its founding—by Muslim Arabs. In what is today southern Iran, the Persians emerged to challenge Median supremacy on the Iranian plateau. By 550 BC, the Persians had replaced Median rule with their own dominion and even began to expand past previous Median imperial borders. Both Gandhara and Kamboja Mahajanapadas of the Buddhist texts soon fell a prey to the Achaemenian Dynasty during the reign of Achaemenid, Cyrus the Great (558–530 BC), or in the first year of Darius I, marking the region or of the easternmost provinces of the empire, located partly in nowadays Afghanistan. According to Pliny&#x27;s evidence, Cyrus the Great (Cyrus II) had destroyed Kapisa in Capiscene which was a Kamboja city. The former region of Gandhara and Kamboja (upper Indus) had constituted seventh satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire and annually contributed 170 talents of gold dust as a tribute to the Achaemenids.

Bactria had a special position in old Afghanistan, being the capital of a vice-kingdom. By the 4th century BC, Persian control of outlying areas and the internal cohesion of the empire had become somewhat tenuous. Although distant provinces like Bactriana had often been restless under Achaemenid rule, Bactrian troops nevertheless fought in the decisive Battle of Gaugamela in 330 BC against the advancing armies of Alexander the Great. The Achaemenids were decisively defeated by Alexander and retreated from his advancing army of Greco-Macedonians and their allies. Darius III, the last Achaemenid ruler, tried to flee to Bactria but was assassinated by a subordinate lord, the Bactrian-born Bessus, who proclaimed himself the new ruler of Persia as Artaxerxes (V). Bessus was unable to mount a successful resistance to the growing military might of Alexander&#x27;s army so he fled to his native Bactria, where he attempted to rally local tribes to his side but was instead turned over to Alexander who proceeded to have him tortured and executed for having committed regicide.

==Alexander the Great to Greco-Bactrian rule (330 BC – 150 BC)==
Moving thousands of kilometers eastward from recently subdued Persia, the Macedonian leader Alexander the Great, encountered fierce resistance from the local tribes of Aria, Drangiana, Arachosia (South and Eastern Afghanistan, North-West Pakistan) and Bactria (North and Central Afghanistan). One of the fiercest battles that he faced was in Herat. One of his top commanding officers was killed by the rebels and he had to go there himself. He couldn&#x27;t defeat them in time and he ended up burning down the forest to finish the rebellion.

Upon Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC, his empire, which had never been politically consolidated, broke apart as his companions began to divide it amongst themselves. Alexander&#x27;s cavalry commander, Seleucus, took nominal control of the eastern lands and founded the Seleucid dynasty. Under the Seleucids, as under Alexander, Greek colonists and soldiers colonized Bactria, roughly corresponding to modern Afghanistan&#x27;s borders. However, the majority of Macedonian soldiers of Alexander the Great wanted to leave the east and return home to Greece. Later, Seleucus sought to guard his eastern frontier and moved Ionian Greeks (also known as Yavanas to many local groups) to Bactria in the 3rd century BC.

Greece had one of the most advanced civilizations at that period. Wherever they went, they left and gained something from cultures and ultimately, they had a civilization that was compromised from other top civilizations of the time. Greek men were marrying with other women and this helped the process of mixing the cultures a lot.

===Maurya Empire===


While the Diadochi were warring amongst themselves, the Mauryan Empire was developing in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. The founder of the empire, Chandragupta Maurya, confronted a Macedonian invasion force led by Seleucus I in 305 BC and following a brief conflict, an agreement was reached as Seleucus ceded Gandhara and Arachosia (centered around ancient Kandahar) and areas south of Bagram (corresponding to the extreme south-east of modern Afghanistan) to the Mauryans. During the 120 years of the Mauryans in southern Afghanistan, Buddhism was introduced and eventually become a major religion alongside Zoroastrianism and local pagan beliefs. The ancient Grand Trunk Road was built linking what is now Kabul to various cities in the Punjab and the Gangetic Plain. Commerce, art, and architecture (seen especially in the construction of stupas) developed during this period. It reached its high point under Emperor Ashoka whose edicts, roads, and rest stops were found throughout the subcontinent. Although the vast majority of them throughout the subcontinent were written in Prakrit, Afghanistan is notable for the inclusion of 2 Greek and Aramaic ones alongside the court language of the Mauryans.

Inscriptions made by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, a fragment of Edict 13 in Greek, as well as a full Edict, written in both Greek and Aramaic has been discovered in Old Kandahar. It is said to be written in excellent Classical Greek, using sophisticated philosophical terms. In this Edict, Ashoka uses the word Eusebeia (&quot;Piety&quot;) as the Greek translation for the ubiquitous &quot;Dharma&quot; of his other Edicts written in Prakrit:

:&quot;Ten years (of reign) having been completed, King Piodasses (Ashoka) made known (the doctrine of) Piety (&quot;εὐσέβεια&quot;, Eusebeia) to men; and from this moment he has made men more pious, and everything thrives throughout the whole world. And the king abstains from (killing) living beings, and other men and those who (are) huntsmen and fishermen of the king have desisted from hunting. And if some (were) intemperate, they have ceased from their intemperance as was in their power; and obedient to their father and mother and to the elders, in opposition to the past also in the future, by so acting on every occasion, they will live better and more happily.&quot; (Trans. by G.P. Carratelli)

The last ruler in the region was probably Subhagasena (Sophagasenus of Polybius), who, in all probability, belonged to the Ashvaka (q.v.) background.

===Greco-Bactrians===

In the middle of the 3rd century BC, an independent, Hellenistic state was declared in Bactria and eventually the control of the Seleucids and Mauryans was overthrown in western and southern Afghanistan. Graeco-Bactrian rule spread until it included a large territory which stretched from Turkmenistan in the west to the Punjab in India in the east by about 170 BC. Graeco-Bactrian rule was eventually defeated by a combination of internecine disputes that plagued Greek and Hellenized rulers to the west, continual conflict with Indian kingdoms, as well as the pressure of two groups of nomadic invaders from Central Asia—the Parthians and Sakas.

==Kushan Empire (150 BC–300 AD)==
In the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, the Parthians, a nomadic Iranian peoples, arrived in Western Asia. While they made large inroads into the modern-day territory of Afghanistan, about 100 years later another Indo-European group from the north—the Kushans (a subgroup of the tribe called the Yuezhi by the Chinese)—entered the region of Afghanistan and established an empire lasting almost four centuries, which would dominate most of the Afghanistan region.

The Kushan Empire spread from the Kabul River valley to defeat other Central Asian tribes that had previously conquered parts of the northern central Iranian Plateau once ruled by the Parthians. By the middle of the 1st century BC, the Kushans&#x27; base of control became Afghanistan and their empire spanned from the north of the Pamir mountains to the Ganges river valley in India. During rule of Kanishka, they had 2 seasonal capital cities which were Kabul in Spring and Summer then moving to Peshawr for Fall and Winter. Early in the 2nd century under Kanishka, the most powerful of the Kushan rulers, the empire reached its greatest geographic and cultural breadth to become a center of literature and art. Kanishka extended Kushan control to the mouth of the Indus River on the Arabian Sea, into Kashmir, and into what is today the Chinese-controlled area north of Tibet. Kanishka was a patron of religion and the arts. It was during his reign that Buddhism, which was promoted in northern India earlier by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka (c. 260 BC–232 BC), reached its zenith in Central Asia. Though the Kushanas supported local Buddhists and Hindus as well as the worship of various local deities.

== Sasanian &amp; Hephthalite invasions (300–650) ==
In the 3rd century, Kushan control fragmented into semi-independent kingdoms that became easy targets for conquest by the rising Iranian dynasty, the Sasanians (c. 224–561) which annexed Afghanistan by 300 AD. In these far off easternmost territories, they established vassal kings as rulers, known as the Kushanshahs. Sasanian control was tenuous at times as numerous challenges from Central Asian tribes led to instability and constant warfare in the region.

The disunited Kushan and Sasanian kingdoms were in a poor position to meet the threat several waves of Xionite/Huna invaders from the north from the 4th century onwards. In particular, the Hephthalites (or &quot;Ebodalo&quot;; Bactrian script ηβοδαλο) swept out of Central Asia during the 5th century into Bactria and Iran, overwhelming the last of the Kushan kingdoms. Historians believe that Hephthalite control continued for a century and was marked by constant warfare with the Sassanians to the west who exerted nominal control over the region.
By the middle of the 6th century the Hephthalites were defeated in the territories north of the Amu Darya (the Oxus River of antiquity) by another group of Central Asian nomads, the Göktürks, and by the resurgent Sassanians in the lands south of the Amu Darya. It was the ruler of western Göktürks, Sijin (a.k.a. Sinjibu, Silzibul and Yandu Muchu Khan) who led the forces against the Hepthalites who were defeated at the Battle of Chach (Tashkent) and at the Battle of Bukhara.

==Kabul Shahi==

The Shahi dynasties ruled portions of the Kabul Valley (in eastern Afghanistan) and the old province of Gandhara (northern Pakistan and Kashmir) from the decline of the Kushan Empire in the 3rd century to the early 9th century. They are split into two eras the Buddhist Turk Shahis and the later Hindu Shahis with the change-over occurring around 870, and ruled up until the Islamic conquest of Afghanistan.

When Xuanzang visited the region early in the 7th century, the Kabul region was ruled by a Kshatriya king, who is identified as the &quot;Shahi Khingal&quot;, and whose name has been found in an inscription found in Gardez. The Turkic Shahi regency was overthrown and replaced by a Mohyal Shahi dynasty of Brahmins who began the first phase of the Hindu Shahi dynasty.

These Hindu kings of Kabul and Gandhara may have had links to some ruling families in neighboring Kashmir and other areas to the east. The Shahis were rulers of predominantly Buddhist, Zoroastrian, Hindu and Muslim populations and were thus patrons of numerous faiths, and various artifacts and coins from their rule have been found that display their multicultural domain. In 964 AD, the last Mohyal Shahi was succeeded by the Janjua overlord, Jayapala, of the Panduvanshi dynasty. The last Shahi emperors Jayapala, Anandapala and Tirlochanpala fought the Muslim Ghaznavids of Ghazna and were gradually defeated. Their remaining army were eventually exiled into northern India.

==Archaeological remnants==
Most of the Zoroastrian, Greek, Hellenistic, Buddhist, Hindu and other indigenous cultures were replaced by the coming of Islam and little influence remains in Afghanistan today. Along ancient trade routes, however, stone monuments of the once flourishing Buddhist culture did exist as reminders of the past. The two massive sandstone Buddhas of Bamyan, 35 and 53 meters high, overlooked the ancient route through Bamyan to Balkh and dated from the 3rd and 5th centuries. They survived until 2001, when they were destroyed by the Taliban. In this and other key places in Afghanistan, archaeologists have located frescoes, stucco decorations, statuary, and rare objects from as far away as China, Phoenicia, and Rome, which were crafted as early as the 2nd century and bear witness to the influence of these ancient civilizations upon Afghanistan.

One of the early Buddhist schools, the Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda, were known to be prominent in the area of Bamiyan. The Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang visited a Lokottaravāda monastery in the 7th century CE, at Bamiyan, Afghanistan, and this monastery site has since been rediscovered by archaeologists. Birchbark and palm leaf manuscripts of texts in this monastery&#x27;s collection, including Mahāyāna sūtras, have been discovered at the site, and these are now located in the Schøyen Collection. Some manuscripts are in the Gāndhārī language and Kharoṣṭhī script, while others are in Sanskrit and written in forms of the Gupta script. Manuscripts and fragments that have survived from this monastery&#x27;s collection include well-known Buddhist texts such as the &quot;Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; (from the &quot;Āgamas&quot;), the &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā&quot;), the &quot;Medicine Buddha Sūtra&quot;, and the &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot;.

In 2010, reports stated that about 42 Buddhist relics have been discovered in the Logar Province of Afghanistan, which is south of Kabul. Some of these items date back to the 2nd century according to Archaeologists. The items included two Buddhist temples (Stupas), Buddha statues, frescos, silver and gold coins and precious beads.

<text>In physics and general relativity, gravitational redshift (known as Einstein shift in older literature) is the phenomenon that electromagnetic waves or photons travelling out of a gravitational well lose energy. This loss of energy corresponds to a decrease in the wave frequency and increase in the wavelength, known more generally as a &quot;redshift&quot;. The opposite effect, in which photons gain energy when travelling into a gravitational well, is known as a gravitational blueshift (a type of &quot;blueshift&quot;). The effect was first described by Einstein in 1907, eight years before his publication of the full theory of relativity.

Gravitational redshift can be interpreted as a consequence of the equivalence principle (that gravitational effects are locally equivalent to inertial effects and the redshift is caused by the Doppler effect) or as a consequence of the mass–energy equivalence and conservation of energy (&#x27;falling&#x27; photons gain energy), though there are numerous subtleties that complicate a rigorous derivation. A gravitational redshift can also equivalently be interpreted as gravitational time dilation at the source of the radiation: if two oscillators (attached to transmitters producing electromagnetic radiation) are operating at different gravitational potentials, the oscillator at the higher gravitational potential (farther from the attracting body) will tick faster; that is, when observed from the same location, it will have a higher measured frequency than the oscillator at the lower gravitational potential (closer to the attracting body).

To first approximation, gravitational redshift is proportional to the difference in gravitational potential divided by the speed of light squared, formula_1, thus resulting in a very small effect. Light escaping from the surface of the Sun was predicted by Einstein in 1911 to be redshifted by roughly 2 ppm or 2 × 10−6. Navigational signals from GPS satellites orbiting at altitude are perceived blueshifted by approximately 0.5 ppb or 5 × 10−10, corresponding to a (negligible) increase of less than 1 Hz in the frequency of a 1.5 GHz GPS radio signal (however, the accompanying gravitational time dilation affecting the atomic clock in the satellite &quot;is&quot; crucially important for accurate navigation). On the surface of the Earth the gravitational potential is proportional to height, formula_2, and the corresponding redshift is roughly 10−16 (0.1 parts per quadrillion) per meter of change in elevation and/or altitude.

In astronomy, the magnitude of a gravitational redshift is often expressed as the velocity that would create an equivalent shift through the relativistic Doppler effect. In such units, the 2 ppm sunlight redshift corresponds to a 633 m/s receding velocity, roughly of the same magnitude as convective motions in the Sun, thus complicating the measurement. The GPS satellite gravitational blueshift velocity equivalent is less than 0.2 m/s, which is negligible compared to the actual Doppler shift resulting from its orbital velocity. In astronomical objects with strong gravitational fields the redshift can be much greater; for example, light from the surface of a white dwarf is gravitationally redshifted on average by around (50 km/s)/&quot;c&quot; (around 170 ppm).

Observing the gravitational redshift in the Solar System is one of the classical tests of general relativity. Measuring the gravitational redshift to high precision with atomic clocks can serve as a test of Lorentz symmetry and guide searches for dark matter.

== Prediction by the equivalence principle and general relativity ==
=== Uniform gravitational field or acceleration ===
Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity incorporates the equivalence principle, which can be stated in various different ways. One such statement is that gravitational effects are locally undetectable for a free-falling observer. Therefore, in a laboratory experiment at the surface of the Earth, all gravitational effects should be equivalent to the effects that would have been observed if the laboratory had been accelerating through outer space at &quot;g&quot;. One consequence is a gravitational Doppler effect. If a light pulse is emitted at the floor of the laboratory, then a free-falling observer says that by the time it reaches the ceiling, the ceiling has accelerated away from it, and therefore when observed by a detector fixed to the ceiling, it will be observed to have been Doppler shifted toward the red end of the spectrum. This shift, which the free-falling observer considers to be a kinematical Doppler shift, is thought of by the laboratory observer as a gravitational redshift. Such an effect was verified in the 1959 Pound–Rebka experiment. In a case such as this, where the gravitational field is uniform, the change in wavelength is given by
: formula_3
where formula_4 is the change in height. Since this prediction arises directly from the equivalence principle, it does not require any of the mathematical apparatus of general relativity, and its verification does not specifically support general relativity over any other theory that incorporates the equivalence principle.

On Earth&#x27;s surface (or in a spaceship accelerating at 1 &quot;g&quot;), the gravitational redshift is approximately , the equivalent of a Doppler shift for every 1 m of altitude.

=== Spherically symmetric gravitational field ===
When the field is not uniform, the simplest and most useful case to consider is that of a spherically symmetric field. By Birkhoff&#x27;s theorem, such a field is described in general relativity by the Schwarzschild metric, formula_5, where formula_6 is the clock time of an observer at distance &quot;R&quot; from the center, formula_7 is the time measured by an observer at infinity, formula_8 is the Schwarzschild radius formula_9, &quot;...&quot; represents terms that vanish if the observer is at rest, formula_10 is the Newtonian constant of gravitation, formula_11 the mass of the gravitating body, and formula_12 the speed of light. The result is that frequencies and wavelengths are shifted according to the ratio
: formula_13
where
* formula_14is the wavelength of the light as measured by the observer at infinity,
* formula_15 is the wavelength measured at the source of emission, and
* formula_16 is the radius at which the photon is emitted.

This can be related to the redshift parameter conventionally defined as formula_17.

In the case where neither the emitter nor the observer is at infinity, the transitivity of Doppler shifts allows us to generalize the result to formula_18. The redshift formula for the frequency formula_19 is formula_20. When formula_21 is small, these results are consistent with the equation given above based on the equivalence principle.

The redshift ratio may also be expressed in terms of a (Newtonian) escape velocity formula_22 at formula_23, resulting in the corresponding Lorentz factor:
: formula_24.

For an object compact enough to have an event horizon, the redshift is not defined for photons emitted inside the Schwarzschild radius, both because signals cannot escape from inside the horizon and because an object such as the emitter cannot be stationary inside the horizon, as was assumed above. Therefore, this formula only applies when formula_16 is larger than formula_8. When the photon is emitted at a distance equal to the Schwarzschild radius, the redshift will be &quot;infinitely&quot; large, and it will not escape to &quot;any&quot; finite distance from the Schwarzschild sphere. When the photon is emitted at an infinitely large distance, there is no redshift.

==== Newtonian limit ====
In the Newtonian limit, i.e. when formula_16 is sufficiently large compared to the Schwarzschild radius formula_8, the redshift can be approximated as
: formula_29
where formula_30 is the gravitational acceleration at formula_16. For Earth&#x27;s surface with respect to infinity, &quot;z&quot; is approximately (the equivalent of a 0.2 m/s radial Doppler shift); for the Moon it is approximately (about 1 cm/s). The value for the surface of the Sun is about , corresponding to 0.64 km/s. (For non-relativistic velocities, the radial Doppler equivalent velocity can be approximated by multiplying &quot;z&quot; with the speed of light.)

The z-value can be expressed succinctly in terms of the escape velocity at formula_16, since the gravitational potential is equal to half the square of the escape velocity, thus:
: formula_33
where formula_22 is the escape velocity at formula_16.

It can also be related to the circular orbit velocity formula_36 at formula_16, which equals formula_38, thus
: formula_39.

For example, the gravitational blueshift of distant starlight due to the Sun&#x27;s gravity, which the Earth is orbiting at about 30 km/s, would be approximately 1 × 10−8 or the equivalent of a 3 m/s radial Doppler shift.

For an object in a (circular) orbit, the gravitational redshift is of comparable magnitude as the transverse Doppler effect, formula_40 where , while both are much smaller than the radial Doppler effect, for which formula_41.

==== Prediction of the Newtonian limit using the properties of photons ====
The formula for the gravitational red shift in the Newtonian limit can also be derived using the properties of a photon:

In a gravitational field formula_42 a particle of mass formula_43 and velocity formula_44 changes it&#x27;s energy formula_45 according to:
: formula_46.

For a massless photon described by its energy formula_47 and momentum formula_48 this equation becomes after dividing by the Planck constant formula_49:
: formula_50

Inserting the gravitational field of a spherical body of mass formula_11 within the distance formula_52
: formula_53
and the wave vector of a photon leaving the gravitational field in radial direction
: formula_54
the energy equation becomes
: formula_55
Using formula_56 an ordinary differential equation which is only dependent on the radial distance formula_57 is obtained:
: formula_58

For a photon starting at the surface of a spherical body with a Radius formula_59 with a frequency formula_60 the analytical solution is:
: formula_61

In a large distance from the body formula_62 an observer measures the frequency :
: formula_63

Therefore, the red shift is:
: formula_64

In the linear approximation 
: formula_65

the Newtonian limit for the gravitational red shift of General Relativity is obtained.

== Experimental verification ==
=== Astronomical observations ===
A number of experimenters initially claimed to have identified the effect using astronomical measurements, and the effect was considered to have been finally identified in the spectral lines of the star Sirius B by W.S. Adams in 1925. However, measurements by Adams have been criticized as being too low and these observations are now considered to be measurements of spectra that are unusable because of scattered light from the primary, Sirius A. The first accurate measurement of the gravitational redshift of a white dwarf was done by Popper in 1954, measuring a 21 km/s gravitational redshift of 40 Eridani B. The redshift of Sirius B was finally measured by Greenstein &quot;et al.&quot; in 1971, obtaining the value for the gravitational redshift of 89±16 km/s, with more accurate measurements by the Hubble Space Telescope, showing 80.4±4.8 km/s.

James W. Brault, a graduate student of Robert Dicke at Princeton University, measured the gravitational redshift of the sun using optical methods in 1962. In 2020, a team of scientists published the most accurate measurement of the solar gravitational redshift so far, made by analyzing Fe spectral lines in sunlight reflected by the Moon; their measurement of a mean global 638 ± 6 m/s lineshift is in agreement with the theoretical value of 633.1 m/s. Measuring the solar redshift is complicated by the Doppler shift caused by the motion of the Sun&#x27;s surface, which is of similar magnitude as the gravitational effect.

In 2011, the group of Radek Wojtak of the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen collected data from 8000 galaxy clusters and found that the light coming from the cluster centers tended to be red-shifted compared to the cluster edges, confirming the energy loss due to gravity.

In 2018, the star S2 made its closest approach to Sgr A*, the 4-million solar mass supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, reaching 7650 km/s or about 2.5% of the speed of light while passing the black hole at a distance of just 120 AU, or 1400 Schwarzschild radii. Independent analyses by the GRAVITY collaboration (led by Reinhard Genzel) and the KECK/UCLA Galactic Center Group (led by Andrea Ghez) revealed a combined transverse Doppler and gravitational redshift up to 200 km/s/c, in agreement with general relativity predictions.

In 2021, Mediavilla (IAC, Spain) &amp; Jiménez-Vicente (UGR, Spain) were able to use measurements of the gravitational redshift in quasars up to cosmological redshift of to confirm the predictions of Einstein&#x27;s equivalence principle and the lack of cosmological evolution within 13%.

In 2024, Padilla et al. have estimated the gravitational redshifts of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in eight thousand quasars and one hundred Seyfert type 1 galaxies from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of their emission lines, finding , compatible with SMBHs of ~ 1 billion solar masses and broadline regions of ~ 1 parsec radius. This same gravitational redshift was directly measured by these authors in the SAMI sample of LINER galaxies, using the redshift differences between lines emitted in central and outer regions.

=== Terrestrial tests ===

The effect is now considered to have been definitively verified by the experiments of Pound, Rebka and Snider between 1959 and 1965. The Pound–Rebka experiment of 1959 measured the gravitational redshift in spectral lines using a terrestrial 57Fe gamma source over a vertical height of 22.5 metres. This paper was the first determination of the gravitational redshift which used measurements of the change in wavelength of gamma-ray photons generated with the Mössbauer effect, which generates radiation with a very narrow line width. The accuracy of the gamma-ray measurements was typically 1%.

An improved experiment was done by Pound and Snider in 1965, with an accuracy better than the 1% level.

A very accurate gravitational redshift experiment was performed in 1976, where a hydrogen maser clock on a rocket was launched to a height of , and its rate compared with an identical clock on the ground. It tested the gravitational redshift to 0.007%.

Later tests can be done with the Global Positioning System (GPS), which must account for the gravitational redshift in its timing system, and physicists have analyzed timing data from the GPS to confirm other tests. When the first satellite was launched, it showed the predicted shift of 38 microseconds per day. This rate of the discrepancy is sufficient to substantially impair the function of GPS within hours if not accounted for. An excellent account of the role played by general relativity in the design of GPS can be found in Ashby 2003.

In 2010, an experiment placed two aluminum-ion quantum clocks close to each other, but with the second elevated 33 cm compared to the first, making the gravitational red shift effect visible in everyday lab scales.

In 2020, a group at the University of Tokyo measured the gravitational redshift of two strontium-87 optical lattice clocks. The measurement took place at Tokyo Skytree where the clocks were separated by approximately 450 m and connected by telecom fibers. The gravitational redshift can be expressed as
: formula_66,
where formula_67 is the gravitational redshift, formula_68 is the optical clock transition frequency, formula_69 is the difference in gravitational potential, and formula_70 denotes the violation from general relativity. By Ramsey spectroscopy of the strontium-87 optical clock transition (429 THz, 698 nm) the group determined the gravitational redshift between the two optical clocks to be 21.18 Hz, corresponding to a &quot;z&quot;-value of approximately 5 × 10−14. Their measured value of formula_70, formula_72, is an agreement with recent measurements made with hydrogen masers in elliptical orbits.

In October 2021, a group at JILA led by physicist Jun Ye reported a measurement of gravitational redshift in the submillimeter scale. The measurement is done on the 87Sr clock transition between the top and the bottom of a millimeter-tall ultracold cloud of 100,000 strontium atoms in an optical lattice.

== Early historical development of the theory ==
The gravitational weakening of light from high-gravity stars was predicted by John Michell in 1783 and Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1796, using Isaac Newton&#x27;s concept of light corpuscles (see: emission theory) and who predicted that some stars would have a gravity so strong that light would not be able to escape. The effect of gravity on light was then explored by Johann Georg von Soldner (1801), who calculated the amount of deflection of a light ray by the Sun, arriving at the Newtonian answer which is half the value predicted by general relativity. All of this early work assumed that light could slow down and fall, which is inconsistent with the modern understanding of light waves.

Once it became accepted that light was an electromagnetic wave, it was clear that the frequency of light should not change from place to place, since waves from a source with a fixed frequency keep the same frequency everywhere. One way around this conclusion would be if time itself were altered if clocks at different points had different rates. This was precisely Einstein&#x27;s conclusion in 1911. He considered an accelerating box, and noted that according to the special theory of relativity, the clock rate at the &quot;bottom&quot; of the box (the side away from the direction of acceleration) was slower than the clock rate at the &quot;top&quot; (the side toward the direction of acceleration). Indeed, in a frame moving (in formula_73 direction) with velocity formula_74 relative to the rest frame, the clocks at a nearby position formula_75 are ahead by formula_76 (to the first order); so an acceleration formula_30 (that changes speed by formula_78 per time formula_7) makes clocks at the position formula_75 to be ahead by formula_81, that is, tick at a rate 
: formula_82

The equivalence principle implies that this change in clock rate is the same whether the acceleration formula_30 is that of an accelerated frame without gravitational effects, or caused by a gravitational field in a stationary frame. Since acceleration due to gravitational potential formula_84 is formula_85, we get
: formula_86
so – in weak fields – the change formula_87 in the clock rate is equal to formula_88.

Since the light would be slowed down by gravitational time dilation (as seen by outside observer), the regions with lower gravitational potential would act like a medium with higher refractive index causing light to deflect. This reasoning allowed Einstein in 1911 to reproduce the incorrect Newtonian value for the deflection of light. At the time he only considered the time-dilating manifestation of gravity, which is the dominating contribution at non-relativistic speeds; however relativistic objects travel through space a comparable amount as they do though time, so purely spatial curvature becomes just as important. After constructing the full theory of general relativity, Einstein solved in 1915 the full post-Newtonian approximation for the Sun&#x27;s gravity and calculated the correct amount of light deflection – double the Newtonian value. Einstein&#x27;s prediction was confirmed by many experiments, starting with Arthur Eddington&#x27;s 1919 solar eclipse expedition.

The changing rates of clocks allowed Einstein to conclude that light waves change frequency as they move, and the frequency/energy relationship for photons allowed him to see that this was best interpreted as the effect of the gravitational field on the mass–energy of the photon. To calculate the changes in frequency in a nearly static gravitational field, only the time component of the metric tensor is important, and the lowest order approximation is accurate enough for ordinary stars and planets, which are much bigger than their Schwarzschild radius.

<doc id="10350" wikidata="Q193689" url="?curid=10350" title="Easter Rising">
<text>The Easter Rising (), also known as the Easter Rebellion, was an armed insurrection in Ireland during Easter Week in April 1916. The Rising was launched by Irish republicans against British rule in Ireland with the aim of establishing an independent Irish Republic while the United Kingdom was fighting the First World War. It was the most significant uprising in Ireland since the rebellion of 1798 and the first armed conflict of the Irish revolutionary period. Sixteen of the Rising&#x27;s leaders were executed starting in May 1916. The nature of the executions, and subsequent political developments, ultimately contributed to an increase in popular support for Irish independence.

Organised by a seven-man Military Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the Rising began on Easter Monday, 24 April 1916 and lasted for six days. Members of the Irish Volunteers, led by schoolmaster and Irish language activist Patrick Pearse, joined by the smaller Irish Citizen Army of James Connolly and 200 women of Cumann na mBan seized strategically important buildings in Dublin and proclaimed the Irish Republic. The British Army brought in thousands of reinforcements as well as artillery and a gunboat. There was street fighting on the routes into the city centre, where the rebels slowed the British advance and inflicted many casualties. Elsewhere in Dublin, the fighting mainly consisted of sniping and long-range gun battles. The main rebel positions were gradually surrounded and bombarded with artillery. There were isolated actions in other parts of Ireland; Volunteer leader Eoin MacNeill had issued a countermand in a bid to halt the Rising, which greatly reduced the extent of the rebel actions.

With much greater numbers and heavier weapons, the British Army suppressed the Rising. Pearse agreed to an unconditional surrender on Saturday 29 April, although sporadic fighting continued briefly. After the surrender, the country remained under martial law. About 3,500 people were taken prisoner by the British and 1,800 of them were sent to internment camps or prisons in Britain. Most of the leaders of the Rising were executed following courts martial. The Rising brought physical force republicanism back to the forefront of Irish politics, which for nearly fifty years had been dominated by constitutional nationalism. Opposition to the British reaction to the Rising contributed to changes in public opinion and the move toward independence, as shown in the December 1918 election in Ireland which was won by the Sinn Féin party, which convened the First Dáil and declared independence.

Of the 485 people killed, 260 were civilians, 143 were British military and police personnel, and 82 were Irish rebels, including 16 rebels executed for their roles in the Rising. More than 2,600 people were wounded. Many of the civilians were killed or wounded by British artillery fire or were mistaken for rebels. Others were caught in the crossfire during firefights between the British and the rebels. The shelling and resulting fires left parts of central Dublin in ruins.

== Background ==
The Acts of Union 1800 united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, abolishing the Irish Parliament and giving Ireland representation in the British Parliament. From early on, many Irish nationalists opposed the union and the continued lack of adequate political representation, along with the British government&#x27;s handling of Ireland and Irish people, particularly the Great Famine. The union was closely preceded by and formed partly in response to an Irish uprising – whose centenary would prove an influence on the Easter Rising. Three more rebellions ensued: one in 1803, another in 1848 and one in 1867. All were failures.

Opposition took other forms: constitutional (the Repeal Association; the Home Rule League) and social (disestablishment of the Church of Ireland; the Land League). The Irish Home Rule movement sought to achieve self-government for Ireland, within the United Kingdom. In 1886, the Irish Parliamentary Party under Charles Stewart Parnell succeeded in having the First Home Rule Bill introduced in the British parliament, but it was defeated. The Second Home Rule Bill of 1893 was passed by the House of Commons but rejected by the House of Lords.

After the death of Parnell, younger and more radical nationalists became disillusioned with parliamentary politics and turned toward more extreme forms of separatism. The Gaelic Athletic Association, the Gaelic League, and the cultural revival under W. B. Yeats and Augusta, Lady Gregory, together with the new political thinking of Arthur Griffith expressed in his newspaper &quot;Sinn Féin&quot; and organisations such as the National Council and the Sinn Féin League, led many Irish people to identify with the idea of an independent Gaelic Ireland.

The Third Home Rule Bill was introduced by British Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith in 1912. Irish Unionists, who were overwhelmingly Protestants, opposed it, as they did not want to be ruled by a Catholic-dominated Irish government. Led by Sir Edward Carson and James Craig, they formed the Ulster Volunteers (UVF) in January 1913. The UVF&#x27;s opposition included arming themselves, in the event that they had to resist by force.

Seeking to defend Home Rule, the Irish Volunteers was formed in November 1913. Although sporting broadly open membership and without avowed support for separatism, the executive branch of the Irish Volunteers – excluding leadership – was dominated by the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) who rose to prominence via the organisation, having had restarted recruitment in 1909. These members feared that Home Rule&#x27;s enactment would result in a broad, seemingly perpetual, contentment with the British Empire. Another militant group, the Irish Citizen Army, was formed by trade unionists as a result of the Dublin Lock-out of that year. The issue of Home Rule, appeared to some, as the basis of an &quot;imminent civil war&quot;.

Although the Third Home Rule Bill was eventually enacted, the outbreak of the First World War resulted in its implementation being postponed for the war&#x27;s duration. It was widely believed at the time that the war would not last more than a few months. The Irish Volunteers split. The vast majority – thereafter known as the National Volunteers – enlisted in the British Army. The minority that objected – retaining the name – did so in accordance with separatist principles, official policy thus becoming &quot;the abolition of the system of governing Ireland through Dublin Castle and the British military power and the establishment of a National Government in its place&quot;; the Volunteers believed that &quot;England&#x27;s difficulty&quot; was &quot;Ireland&#x27;s opportunity&quot;.

== Planning the Rising ==

The Supreme Council of the IRB met on 5 September 1914, just over a month after the British government had declared war on Germany. At this meeting, they elected to stage an uprising before the war ended and to secure help from Germany. Responsibility for the planning of the rising was given to Tom Clarke and Seán Mac Diarmada. Patrick Pearse, Michael Joseph O&#x27;Rahilly, Joseph Plunkett and Bulmer Hobson would assume general control of the Volunteers by March 1915.

In May 1915, Clarke and Mac Diarmada established a Military Council within the IRB, consisting of Pearse, Plunkett and Éamonn Ceannt – and soon themselves – to devise plans for a rising. The Military Council functioned independently and in opposition to those who considered a possible uprising inopportune. Volunteer Chief-of-Staff Eoin MacNeill supported a rising only if the British government attempted to suppress the Volunteers or introduce conscription in Ireland, and if such a rising had some chance of success. Hobson and IRB President Denis McCullough held similar views as did much of the executive branches of both organisations.

The Military Council kept its plans secret, so as to prevent the British authorities from learning of the plans, and to thwart those within the organisation who might try to stop the rising. The secrecy of the plans was such that the Military Council largely superseded the IRB&#x27;s Supreme Council with even McCullough being unaware of some of the plans, whereas the likes of MacNeill were only informed as the Rising rapidly approached. Although most Volunteers were oblivious to any plans their training increased in the preceding year. The public nature of their training heightened tensions with authorities, which, come the next year, manifested in rumours of the Rising. Public displays likewise existed in the espousal of anti-recruitment. The number of Volunteers also increased: between December 1914 and February 1916 the rank and file rose from 9,700 to 12,215. Although the likes of the civil servants were discouraged from joining the Volunteers, the organisation was permitted by law.

Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, Roger Casement and John Devoy went to Germany and began negotiations with the German government and military. Casement – later accompanied by Plunkett – persuaded the Germans to announce their support for Irish independence in November 1914. Casement envisioned the recruitment of Irish prisoners of war, to be known as the Irish Brigade, aided by a German expeditionary force who would secure the line of the River Shannon, before advancing on the capital. Neither intention came to fruition, but the German military did agree to ship arms and ammunition to the Volunteers, gunrunning having become difficult and dangerous on account of the war.

In late 1915 and early 1916 Devoy had trusted couriers deliver approximately $100,000 from the American-based Irish Republican organization Clan na Gael to the IRB. In January 1916 the Supreme Council of the IRB decided that he rising would begin on Easter Sunday, 23 April 1916. On 5 February 1916 Devoy received a coded message from the Supreme Council of the IRB informing him of their decision to start a rebellion at Easter 1916: &quot;We have decided to begin action on Easter Sunday. We must have your arms and munitions in Limerick between Good Friday and Easter Sunday. We expect German help immediately after beginning action. We might have to begin earlier.&quot;

Head of the Irish Citizen Army, James Connolly, was unaware of the IRB&#x27;s plans, and threatened to start a rebellion on his own if other parties failed to act. The IRB leaders met with Connolly in Dolphin&#x27;s Barn in January 1916 and convinced him to join forces with them. They agreed that they would launch a rising together at Easter and made Connolly the sixth member of the Military Council. Thomas MacDonagh would later become the seventh and final member.

The death of the old Fenian leader Jeremiah O&#x27;Donovan Rossa in New York City in August 1915 was an opportunity to mount a spectacular demonstration. His body was sent to Ireland for burial in Glasnevin Cemetery, with the Volunteers in charge of arrangements. Huge crowds lined the route and gathered at the graveside. Pearse (wearing the uniform of the Irish Volunteers) made a dramatic funeral oration, a rallying call to republicans, which ended with the words &quot;Ireland unfree shall never be at peace&quot;.

== Build-up to Easter Week ==

In early April, Pearse issued orders to the Irish Volunteers for three days of &quot;parades and manoeuvres&quot; beginning on Easter Sunday. He had the authority to do this, as the Volunteers&#x27; Director of Organisation. The idea was that IRB members within the organisation would know these were orders to begin the rising, while men such as MacNeill and the British authorities would take it at face value.

On 9 April, the German Navy dispatched the SS &quot;Libau&quot; for County Kerry, disguised as the Norwegian ship &quot;Aud&quot;. It was loaded with 20,000 rifles, one million rounds of ammunition, and explosives. Casement also left for Ireland aboard the German submarine &quot;U-19&quot;. He was disappointed with the level of support offered by the Germans and he intended to stop or at least postpone the rising. During this time, the Volunteers amassed ammunition from various sources, including the adolescent Michael McCabe.

On Wednesday 19 April, Alderman Tom Kelly, a Sinn Féin member of Dublin Corporation, read out at a meeting of the corporation a document purportedly leaked from Dublin Castle, detailing plans by the British authorities to shortly arrest leaders of the Irish Volunteers, Sinn Féin and the Gaelic League, and occupy their premises. Although the British authorities said the &quot;Castle Document&quot; was fake, MacNeill ordered the Volunteers to prepare to resist. Unbeknownst to MacNeill, the document had been forged by the Military Council to persuade moderates of the need for their planned uprising. It was an edited version of a real document outlining British plans in the event of conscription. That same day, the Military Council informed senior Volunteer officers that the rising would begin on Easter Sunday. However, it chose not to inform the , or moderates such as MacNeill, until the last minute.

The following day, MacNeill got wind that a rising was about to be launched and threatened to do everything he could to prevent it, short of informing the British. He and Hobson confronted Pearse, but refrained from decisive action as to avoiding instigating a rebellion of any kind; Hobson would be detained by Volunteers until the Rising occurred.

The &quot;SS Libau&quot; (disguised as the &quot;Aud&quot;) and the &quot;U-19&quot; reached the coast of Kerry on Good Friday, 21 April. This was earlier than the Volunteers expected and so none were there to meet the vessels. The Royal Navy had known about the arms shipment and intercepted the &quot;SS Libau&quot;, prompting the captain to scuttle the ship. Furthermore, Casement was captured shortly after he landed at Banna Strand.

When MacNeill learned that the arms shipment had been lost, he reverted to his original position. With the support of other leaders of like mind, notably Bulmer Hobson and The O&#x27;Rahilly, he issued a countermand to all Volunteers, cancelling all actions for Sunday. This countermanding order was relayed to Volunteer officers and printed in the Sunday morning newspapers. The order resulted in a delay to the rising by a day, and some confusion over strategy for those who took part.

British Naval Intelligence had been aware of the arms shipment, Casement&#x27;s return, and the Easter date for the rising through radio messages between Germany and its embassy in the United States that were intercepted by the Royal Navy and deciphered in Room 40 of the Admiralty. It is unclear how extensive Room 40&#x27;s decryptions preceding the Rising were. On the eve of the Rising, John Dillon wrote to Redmond of Dublin being &quot;full of most extraordinary rumours. And I have no doubt in my mind that the Clan men – are planning some devilish business – what it is I cannot make out. It may not come off – But you must not be surprised if something very unpleasant and mischievous happens this week&quot;.

The information was passed to the Under-Secretary for Ireland, Sir Matthew Nathan, on 17 April, but without revealing its source; Nathan was doubtful about its accuracy. When news reached Dublin of the capture of the &quot;SS Libau&quot; and the arrest of Casement, Nathan conferred with the Lord Lieutenant, Lord Wimborne. Nathan proposed to raid Liberty Hall, headquarters of the Citizen Army, and Volunteer properties at Father Matthew Park and at Kimmage, but Wimborne insisted on wholesale arrests of the leaders. It was decided to postpone action until after Easter Monday, and in the meantime, Nathan telegraphed the Chief Secretary, Augustine Birrell, in London seeking his approval. By the time Birrell cabled his reply authorising the action, at noon on Monday 24 April 1916, the Rising had already begun.

On the morning of Easter Sunday, 23 April, the Military Council met at Liberty Hall to discuss what to do in light of MacNeill&#x27;s countermanding order. They decided that the Rising would go ahead the following day, Easter Monday, and that the Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army would go into action as the &#x27;Army of the Irish Republic&#x27;. They elected Pearse as president of the Irish Republic, and also as Commander-in-Chief of the army; Connolly became Commandant of the Dublin Brigade. That weekend was largely spent preparing rations and manufacturing ammunition and bombs. Messengers were then sent to all units informing them of the new orders.

== The Rising in Dublin ==

=== Easter Monday ===

On the morning of Monday 24 April, about 1,200 members of the Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army mustered at several locations in central Dublin. Among them were members of the all-female Cumann na mBan. Some wore Irish Volunteer and Citizen Army uniforms, while others wore civilian clothes with a yellow Irish Volunteer armband, military hats, and bandoliers. They were armed mostly with rifles (especially 1871 Mausers), but also with shotguns, revolvers, a few Mauser C96 semi-automatic pistols, and grenades. The number of Volunteers who mobilised was much smaller than expected. This was due to MacNeill&#x27;s countermanding order, and the fact that the new orders had been sent so soon beforehand. However, several hundred Volunteers joined the Rising after it began.

Shortly before midday, the rebels began to seize important sites in central Dublin. The rebels&#x27; plan was to hold Dublin city centre. This was a large, oval-shaped area bounded by two canals: the Grand to the south and the Royal to the north, with the River Liffey running through the middle. On the southern and western edges of this district were five British Army barracks. Most of the rebels&#x27; positions had been chosen to defend against counter-attacks from these barracks. The rebels took the positions with ease. Civilians were evacuated and policemen were ejected or taken prisoner. Windows and doors were barricaded, food and supplies were secured, and first aid posts were set up. Barricades were erected on the streets to hinder British Army movement.

A joint force of about 400 Volunteers and the Citizen Army gathered at Liberty Hall under the command of Commandant James Connolly. This was the headquarters battalion, and it also included Commander-in-Chief Patrick Pearse, as well as Tom Clarke, Seán Mac Diarmada and Joseph Plunkett. They marched to the General Post Office (GPO) on O&#x27;Connell Street, Dublin&#x27;s main thoroughfare, occupied the building and hoisted two republican flags. Pearse stood outside and read the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. Copies of the Proclamation were also pasted on walls and handed out to bystanders by Volunteers and newsboys. The GPO would be the rebels&#x27; headquarters for most of the Rising. Volunteers from the GPO also occupied other buildings on the street, including buildings overlooking O&#x27;Connell Bridge. They took over a wireless telegraph station and sent out a radio broadcast in Morse code, announcing that an Irish Republic had been declared. This was the first radio broadcast in Ireland.

Elsewhere, some of the headquarters battalion under Michael Mallin occupied St Stephen&#x27;s Green, where they dug trenches and barricaded the surrounding roads. The 1st battalion, under Edward &#x27;Ned&#x27; Daly, occupied the Four Courts and surrounding buildings, while a company under Seán Heuston occupied the Mendicity Institution, across the River Liffey from the Four Courts. The 2nd battalion, under Thomas MacDonagh, occupied Jacob&#x27;s biscuit factory. The 3rd battalion, under Éamon de Valera, occupied Boland&#x27;s Mill and surrounding buildings (uniquely, without the presence of Cumann na mBan women whom de Valera expressly excluded). The 4th battalion, under Éamonn Ceannt, occupied the South Dublin Union and the distillery on Marrowbone Lane. From each of these garrisons, small units of rebels established outposts in the surrounding area.

The rebels also attempted to cut transport and communication links. As well as erecting roadblocks, they took control of various bridges and cut telephone and telegraph wires. Westland Row and Harcourt Street railway stations were occupied, though the latter only briefly. The railway line was cut at Fairview and the line was damaged by bombs at Amiens Street, Broadstone, Kingsbridge and Lansdowne Road.

Around midday, a small team of Volunteers and Fianna Éireann members swiftly captured the Magazine Fort in the Phoenix Park and disarmed the guards. The goal was to seize weapons and blow up the ammunition store to signal that the Rising had begun. They seized weapons and planted explosives, but the blast was not loud enough to be heard across the city. The 23-year-old son of the fort&#x27;s commander was fatally shot when he ran to raise the alarm.

A contingent under Seán Connolly occupied Dublin City Hall and adjacent buildings. They attempted to seize neighbouring Dublin Castle, the heart of British rule in Ireland. As they approached the gate a lone and unarmed police sentry, James O&#x27;Brien, attempted to stop them and was shot dead by Connolly. According to some accounts, he was the first casualty of the Rising. The rebels overpowered the soldiers in the guardroom but failed to press further. The British Army&#x27;s chief intelligence officer, Major Ivon Price, fired on the rebels while the Under-Secretary for Ireland, Sir Matthew Nathan, helped shut the castle gates. Unbeknownst to the rebels, the Castle was lightly guarded and could have been taken with ease. The rebels instead laid siege to the Castle from City Hall. Fierce fighting erupted there after British reinforcements arrived. The rebels on the roof exchanged fire with soldiers on the street. Seán Connolly was shot dead by a sniper, becoming the first rebel casualty. By the following morning, British forces had re-captured City Hall and taken the rebels prisoner.

The rebels did not attempt to take some other key locations, notably Trinity College, in the heart of the city centre and defended by only a handful of armed unionist students. Failure to capture the telephone exchange in Crown Alley left communications in the hands of the Government with GPO staff quickly repairing telephone wires that had been cut by the rebels. The failure to occupy strategic locations was attributed to lack of manpower. In at least two incidents, at Jacob&#x27;s and Stephen&#x27;s Green, the Volunteers and Citizen Army shot dead civilians trying to attack them or dismantle their barricades. Elsewhere, they hit civilians with their rifle butts to drive them off.

The British military were caught totally unprepared by the Rising and their response of the first day was generally un-coordinated. Two squadrons of British cavalry were sent to investigate what was happening. They took fire and casualties from rebel forces at the GPO and at the Four Courts. As one troop passed Nelson&#x27;s Pillar, the rebels opened fire from the GPO, killing three cavalrymen and two horses and fatally wounding a fourth man. The cavalrymen retreated and were withdrawn to barracks. On Mount Street, a group of Volunteer Training Corps men stumbled upon the rebel position and four were killed before they reached Beggars Bush Barracks. Although ransacked, the barracks were never seized.

The only substantial combat of the first day of the Rising took place at the South Dublin Union where a piquet from the Royal Irish Regiment encountered an outpost of Éamonn Ceannt&#x27;s force at the northwestern corner of the South Dublin Union. The British troops, after taking some casualties, managed to regroup and launch several assaults on the position before they forced their way inside and the small rebel force in the tin huts at the eastern end of the Union surrendered. However, the Union complex as a whole remained in rebel hands. A nurse in uniform, Margaret Keogh, was shot dead by British soldiers at the Union. She is believed to have been the first civilian killed in the Rising.

Three unarmed Dublin Metropolitan Police were shot dead on the first day of the Rising and their Commissioner pulled them off the streets. Partly as a result of the police withdrawal, a wave of looting broke out in the city centre, especially in the area of O&#x27;Connell Street (still officially called &quot;Sackville Street&quot; at the time).

=== Tuesday and Wednesday ===
Lord Wimborne, the Lord Lieutenant, declared martial law on Tuesday evening and handed over civil power to Brigadier-General William Lowe. British forces initially put their efforts into securing the approaches to Dublin Castle and isolating the rebel headquarters, which they believed was in Liberty Hall. The British commander, Lowe, worked slowly, unsure of the size of the force he was up against, and with only 1,269 troops in the city when he arrived from the Curragh Camp in the early hours of Tuesday 25 April. City Hall was taken from the rebel unit that had attacked Dublin Castle on Tuesday morning.

In the early hours of Tuesday, 120 British soldiers, with machine guns, occupied two buildings overlooking St Stephen&#x27;s Green: the Shelbourne Hotel and United Services Club. At dawn they opened fire on the Citizen Army occupying the green. The rebels returned fire but were forced to retreat to the Royal College of Surgeons building. They remained there for the rest of the week, exchanging fire with British forces.

Fighting erupted along the northern edge of the city centre on Tuesday afternoon. In the northeast, British troops left Amiens Street railway station in an armoured train, to secure and repair a section of damaged tracks. They were attacked by rebels who had taken up position at Annesley Bridge. After a two-hour battle, the British were forced to retreat and several soldiers were captured. At Phibsborough, in the northwest, rebels had occupied buildings and erected barricades at junctions on the North Circular Road. The British summoned 18-pounder field artillery from Athlone and shelled the rebel positions, destroying the barricades. After a fierce firefight, the rebels withdrew.

That afternoon Pearse walked out into O&#x27;Connell Street with a small escort and stood in front of Nelson&#x27;s Pillar. As a large crowd gathered, he read out a &#x27;,&#x27; calling on them to support the Rising.

The rebels had failed to take either of Dublin&#x27;s two main railway stations or either of its ports, at Dublin Port and Kingstown. As a result, during the following week, the British were able to bring in thousands of reinforcements from Britain and from their garrisons at the Curragh and Belfast. By the end of the week, British strength stood at over 16,000 men. Their firepower was provided by field artillery which they positioned on the Northside of the city at Phibsborough and at Trinity College, and by the patrol vessel &quot;Helga&quot;, which sailed up the Liffey, having been summoned from the port at Kingstown. On Wednesday, 26 April, the guns at Trinity College and &quot;Helga&quot; shelled Liberty Hall, and the Trinity College guns then began firing at rebel positions, first at Boland&#x27;s Mill and then in O&#x27;Connell Street. Some rebel commanders, particularly James Connolly, did not believe that the British would shell the &#x27;second city&#x27; of the British Empire.

The principal rebel positions at the GPO, the Four Courts, Jacob&#x27;s Factory and Boland&#x27;s Mill saw little action. The British surrounded and bombarded them rather than assault them directly. One Volunteer in the GPO recalled, &quot;we did practically no shooting as there was no target&quot;. Entertainment ensued within the factory, &quot;everybody merry &amp; cheerful&quot;, bar the &quot;occasional sniping&quot;, noted one Volunteer. However, where the rebels dominated the routes by which the British tried to funnel reinforcements into the city, there was fierce fighting.

At 5:25 PM a dozen Volunteers, including Eamon Martin, Garry Holohan, Robert Beggs, Sean Cody, Dinny O&#x27;Callaghan, Charles Shelley, and Peadar Breslin, attempted to occupy Broadstone railway station on Church Street. The attack was unsuccessful and Martin was injured.

On Wednesday morning, hundreds of British troops encircled the Mendicity Institution, which was occupied by 26 Volunteers under Seán Heuston. British troops advanced on the building, supported by snipers and machine-gun fire, but the Volunteers put up stiff resistance. Eventually, the troops got close enough to hurl grenades into the building, some of which the rebels threw back. Exhausted and almost out of ammunition, Heuston&#x27;s men became the first rebel position to surrender. Heuston had been ordered to hold his position for a few hours, to delay the British, but had held on for three days.

Reinforcements were sent to Dublin from Britain and disembarked at Kingstown on the morning of Wednesday 26 April. Heavy fighting occurred at the rebel-held positions around the Grand Canal as these troops advanced towards Dublin. More than 1,000 Sherwood Foresters were repeatedly caught in a crossfire trying to cross the canal at Mount Street Bridge. Seventeen Volunteers were able to severely disrupt the British advance, killing or wounding 240 men. Despite there being alternative routes across the canal nearby, General Lowe ordered repeated frontal assaults on the Mount Street position. The British eventually took the position, which had not been reinforced by the nearby rebel garrison at Boland&#x27;s Mills, on Thursday, but the fighting there inflicted up to two-thirds of their casualties for the entire week for a cost of just four dead Volunteers. It had taken nearly nine hours for the British to advance .

On Wednesday Linenhall Barracks on Constitution Hill was burnt down under the orders of Commandant Edward Daly to prevent its reoccupation by the British.

=== Thursday to Saturday ===
The rebel position at the South Dublin Union (site of the present-day St. James&#x27;s Hospital) and Marrowbone Lane, further west along the canal, also inflicted heavy losses on British troops. The South Dublin Union was a large complex of buildings and there was vicious fighting around and inside the buildings. Cathal Brugha, a rebel officer, distinguished himself in this action and was badly wounded. By the end of the week, the British had taken some of the buildings in the Union, but others remained in rebel hands. British troops also took casualties in unsuccessful frontal assaults on the Marrowbone Lane Distillery.

The third major scene of fighting during the week was in the area of North King Street, north of the Four Courts. The rebels had established strong outposts in the area, occupying numerous small buildings and barricading the streets. From Thursday to Saturday, the British made repeated attempts to capture the area, in what was some of the fiercest fighting of the Rising. As the troops moved in, the rebels continually opened fire from windows and behind chimneys and barricades. At one point, a platoon led by Major Sheppard made a bayonet charge on one of the barricades but was cut down by rebel fire. The British employed machine guns and attempted to avoid direct fire by using makeshift armoured trucks, and by mouse-holing through the inside walls of terraced houses to get near the rebel positions. By the time of the rebel headquarters&#x27; surrender on Saturday, the South Staffordshire Regiment under Colonel Taylor had advanced only down the street at a cost of 11 dead and 28 wounded. The enraged troops broke into the houses along the street and shot or bayoneted fifteen unarmed male civilians whom they accused of being rebel fighters.

Elsewhere, at Portobello Barracks, an officer named Bowen Colthurst summarily executed six civilians, including the pacifist nationalist activist, Francis Sheehy-Skeffington. These instances of British troops killing Irish civilians would later be highly controversial in Ireland.

=== Surrender ===
The headquarters garrison at the GPO was forced to evacuate after days of shelling when a fire caused by the shells spread to the GPO. Connolly had been incapacitated by a bullet wound to the ankle and had passed command on to Pearse. The O&#x27;Rahilly was killed in a sortie from the GPO. They tunnelled through the walls of the neighbouring buildings in order to evacuate the Post Office without coming under fire and took up a new position in 16 Moore Street. The young Seán McLoughlin was given military command and planned a breakout, but Pearse realised this plan would lead to further loss of civilian life.

On the eve of the surrender, there had been about 35 Cumann na mBan women remaining in the GPO. In the final group that left with Pearse and Connolly, there were three: Connolly&#x27;s aide de camp, Winifred Carney, who had entered with the original ICA contingent, and the dispatchers and nurses Elizabeth O&#x27;Farrell, and Julia Grenan.

On Saturday 29 April, from this new headquarters, Pearse issued an order for all companies to surrender. Pearse surrendered unconditionally to Brigadier-General Lowe. The surrender document read:

The other posts surrendered only after Pearse&#x27;s surrender order, carried by O&#x27;Farrell, reached them. Sporadic fighting, therefore, continued until Sunday, when word of the surrender was got to the other rebel garrisons. Command of British forces had passed from Lowe to General John Maxwell, who arrived in Dublin just in time to take the surrender. Maxwell was made temporary military governor of Ireland.

== The Rising outside Dublin ==

The Rising was planned to occur across the nation, but MacNeill&#x27;s countermanding order coupled with the failure to secure German arms hindered this objective significantly. Charles Townshend contended that serious intentions for a national Rising were meagre, being diminished by a focus upon Dublin – although this is an increasingly contentious notion.

In the south, around 1,200 Volunteers commanded by Tomás Mac Curtain mustered on the Sunday in Cork, but they dispersed on Wednesday after receiving nine contradictory orders by dispatch from the Volunteer leadership in Dublin. At their Sheares Street headquarters, some of the Volunteers engaged in a standoff with British forces. Much to the anger of many Volunteers, MacCurtain, under pressure from Catholic clergy, agreed to surrender his men&#x27;s arms to the British. The only violence in County Cork occurred when the RIC attempted to raid the home of the Kent family. The Kent brothers, who were Volunteers, engaged in a three-hour firefight with the RIC. An RIC officer and one of the brothers were killed, while another brother was later executed. Virtually all rebel family homes were raided, either during or after the Rising.

In the north, Volunteer companies were mobilised in County Tyrone at Coalisland (including 132 men from Belfast led by IRB President Dennis McCullough) and Carrickmore, under the leadership of Patrick McCartan. They also mobilised at Creeslough, County Donegal under Daniel Kelly and James McNulty. However, in part because of the confusion caused by the countermanding order, the Volunteers in these locations dispersed without fighting.

=== Ashbourne ===
In north County Dublin, about 60 Volunteers mobilised near Swords. They belonged to the 5th Battalion of the Dublin Brigade (also known as the Fingal Battalion), and were led by Thomas Ashe and his second in command, Richard Mulcahy. Unlike the rebels elsewhere, the Fingal Battalion successfully employed guerrilla tactics. They set up camp and Ashe split the battalion into four sections: three would undertake operations while the fourth was kept in reserve, guarding camp and foraging for food. The Volunteers moved against the RIC barracks in Swords, Donabate and Garristown, forcing the RIC to surrender and seizing all the weapons. They also damaged railway lines and cut telegraph wires. The railway line at Blanchardstown was bombed to prevent a troop train from reaching Dublin. This derailed a cattle train, which had been sent ahead of the troop train.

The only large-scale engagement of the Rising, outside Dublin city, was at Ashbourne, County Meath. On Friday, about 35 Fingal Volunteers surrounded the Ashbourne RIC barracks and called on it to surrender, but the RIC responded with a volley of gunfire. A firefight followed, and the RIC surrendered after the Volunteers attacked the building with a homemade grenade. Before the surrender could be taken, up to sixty RIC men arrived in a convoy, sparking a five-hour gun battle, in which eight RIC men were killed and 18 wounded. Two Volunteers were also killed and five wounded, and a civilian was fatally shot. The RIC surrendered and were disarmed. Ashe let them go after warning them not to fight against the Irish Republic again. Ashe&#x27;s men camped at Kilsalaghan near Dublin until they received orders to surrender on Saturday. The Fingal Battalion&#x27;s tactics during the Rising foreshadowed those of the IRA during the War of Independence that followed.

Volunteer contingents also mobilised nearby in counties Meath and Louth but proved unable to link up with the North Dublin unit until after it had surrendered. In County Louth, Volunteers shot dead an RIC man near the village of Castlebellingham on 24 April, in an incident in which 15 RIC men were also taken prisoner.

=== Enniscorthy ===

In County Wexford, 100–200 Volunteers—led by Robert Brennan, Séamus Doyle and Seán Etchingham—took over the town of Enniscorthy on Thursday 27 April until Sunday. Volunteer officer Paul Galligan had cycled 200 km from rebel headquarters in Dublin with orders to mobilise. They blocked all roads into the town and made a brief attack on the RIC barracks, but chose to blockade it rather than attempt to capture it. They flew the tricolour over the Athenaeum building, which they had made their headquarters, and paraded uniformed in the streets. They also occupied Vinegar Hill, where the United Irishmen had made a last stand in the 1798 rebellion. The public largely supported the rebels and many local men offered to join them.

By Saturday, up to 1,000 rebels had been mobilised, and a detachment was sent to occupy the nearby village of Ferns. In Wexford, the British assembled a column of 1,000 soldiers (including the Connaught Rangers), two field guns and a 4.7 inch naval gun on a makeshift armoured train. On Sunday, the British sent messengers to Enniscorthy, informing the rebels of Pearse&#x27;s surrender order. However, the Volunteer officers were sceptical. Two of them were escorted by the British to Arbour Hill Prison, where Pearse confirmed the surrender order.

=== Galway ===
In County Galway, 600–700 Volunteers mobilised on Tuesday under Liam Mellows. His plan was to &quot;bottle up the British garrison and divert the British from concentrating on Dublin&quot;. However, his men were poorly armed, with only 25 rifles, 60 revolvers, 300 shotguns and some homemade grenades – many of them only had pikes. Most of the action took place in a rural area to the east of Galway city. They made unsuccessful attacks on the RIC barracks at Clarinbridge and Oranmore, captured several officers, and bombed a bridge and railway line, before taking up position near Athenry. There was also a skirmish between rebels and an RIC mobile patrol at Carnmore crossroads. A constable, Patrick Whelan, was shot dead after he had called to the rebels: &quot;Surrender, boys, I know ye all&quot;.

On Wednesday, arrived in Galway Bay and shelled the countryside on the northeastern edge of Galway. The rebels retreated southeast to Moyode, an abandoned country house and estate. From here they set up lookout posts and sent out scouting parties. On Friday, landed 200 Royal Marines and began shelling the countryside near the rebel position. The rebels retreated further south to Limepark, another abandoned country house. Deeming the situation to be hopeless, they dispersed on Saturday morning. Many went home and were arrested following the Rising, while others, including Mellows, went &quot;on the run&quot;. By the time British reinforcements arrived in the west, the Rising there had already disintegrated.

=== Limerick and Clare ===
In County Limerick, 300 Irish Volunteers assembled at Glenquin Castle near Killeedy, but they did not take any military action.

In County Clare, Micheal Brennan marched with 100 Volunteers (from Meelick, Oatfield, and Cratloe) to the River Shannon on Easter Monday to await orders from the Rising leaders in Dublin, and weapons from the expected Casement shipment. However, neither arrived and no actions were taken.

== Casualties ==

The Easter Rising resulted in at least 485 deaths, according to the Glasnevin Trust.
Of those killed:
* 260 (about 54%) were civilians
* 126 (about 26%) were U.K. forces (120 U.K. military personnel, 5 Volunteer Training Corps members, and one Canadian soldier)
** 35 – Irish Regiments:-
*** 11 – Royal Dublin Fusiliers
*** 10 – Royal Irish Rifles
*** 9 – Royal Irish Regiment
*** 2 – Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers
*** 2 – Royal Irish Fusiliers
*** 1 – Leinster Regiment
** 74 – British Regiments:-
*** 29 – Sherwood Foresters
*** 15 – South Staffordshire
*** 2 – North Staffordshire
*** 1 – Royal Field Artillery
*** 4 – Royal Engineers
*** 5 – Army Service Corps
*** 10 – Lancers
*** 7 – 8th Hussars
*** 2 – 2nd King Edwards Horse
*** 3 – Yeomanry
** 1 – Royal Navy
* 82 (about 16%) were Irish rebel forces (64 Irish Volunteers, 15 Irish Citizen Army and 3 Fianna Éireann)
* 17 (about 4%) were police
** 14 – Royal Irish Constabulary
** 3 – Dublin Metropolitan Police

More than 2,600 were wounded; including at least 2,200 civilians and rebels, at least 370 British soldiers and 29 policemen. All 16 police fatalities and 22 of the British soldiers killed were Irishmen. About 40 of those killed were children (under 17 years old), four of whom were members of the rebel forces.

The number of casualties each day steadily rose, with 55 killed on Monday and 78 killed on Saturday. The British Army suffered their biggest losses in the Battle of Mount Street Bridge on Wednesday when at least 30 soldiers were killed. The rebels also suffered their biggest losses on that day. The RIC suffered most of their casualties in the Battle of Ashbourne on Friday.

The majority of the casualties, both killed and wounded, were civilians. Most of the civilian casualties and most of the casualties overall were caused by the British Army. This was due to the British using artillery, incendiary shells and heavy machine guns in built-up areas, as well as their &quot;inability to discern rebels from civilians&quot;. One Royal Irish Regiment officer recalled, &quot;they regarded, not unreasonably, every one they saw as an enemy, and fired at anything that moved&quot;. Many other civilians were killed when caught in the crossfire. Both sides, British and rebel, also shot civilians deliberately on occasion; for not obeying orders (such as to stop at checkpoints), for assaulting or attempting to hinder them, and for looting. There were also instances of British troops killing unarmed civilians out of revenge or frustration: notably in the North King Street Massacre, where fifteen were killed, and at Portobello Barracks, where six were shot. Furthermore, there were incidents of friendly fire. On 29 April, the Royal Dublin Fusiliers under Company Quartermaster Sergeant Robert Flood shot dead two British officers and two Irish civilian employees of the Guinness Brewery after he decided they were rebels. Flood was court-martialled for murder but acquitted.

According to the historian Fearghal McGarry, the rebels attempted to avoid needless bloodshed. Desmond Ryan stated that Volunteers were told &quot;no firing was to take place except under orders or to repel attack&quot;. Aside from the engagement at Ashbourne, policemen and unarmed soldiers were not systematically targeted, and a large group of policemen was allowed to stand at Nelson&#x27;s Pillar throughout Monday. McGarry writes that the Irish Citizen Army &quot;were more ruthless than Volunteers when it came to shooting policemen&quot; and attributes this to the &quot;acrimonious legacy&quot; of the Dublin Lock-out.

The vast majority of the Irish casualties were buried in Glasnevin Cemetery in the aftermath of the fighting. British families came to Dublin Castle in May 1916 to reclaim the bodies of British soldiers, and funerals were arranged. Soldiers whose bodies were not claimed were given military funerals in Grangegorman Military Cemetery.

== Aftermath ==


=== Arrests and executions ===
In the immediate aftermath, the Rising was commonly described as the &quot;Sinn Féin Rebellion&quot;, reflecting a popular belief that Sinn Féin, a separatist organisation that was neither militant nor republican, was behind it. General Maxwell, for example, signalled his intention &quot;to arrest all dangerous Sinn Feiners&quot;, including &quot;those who have taken an active part in the movement although not in the present rebellion&quot;.

A total of 3,430 men and 79 women were arrested, including 425 people for looting – roughly, 1,500 of these arrests accounted for the rebels. Detainees were overwhelmingly young, Catholic and religious. 1,424 men and 73 women were released after a few weeks of imprisonment; those interned without trial in England and Wales (see below) were released on Christmas Eve, 1916; the remaining majority of convicts were held until June 1917.

A series of courts martial began on 2 May, in which 187 people were tried. Controversially, Maxwell decided that the courts martial would be held in secret and without a defence, which Crown law officers later ruled to have been illegal. Some of those who conducted the trials had commanded British troops involved in suppressing the Rising, a conflict of interest that the Military Manual prohibited. Only one of those tried by courts martial was a woman, Constance Markievicz, who was also the only woman to be kept in solitary confinement. Ninety were sentenced to death. Fifteen of those (including all seven signatories of the Proclamation) had their sentences confirmed by Maxwell and fourteen were executed by firing squad at Kilmainham Gaol between 3 and 12 May.

Maxwell stated that only the &quot;ringleaders&quot; and those proven to have committed &quot;cold-blooded murder&quot; would be executed. However, some of those executed were not leaders and did not kill anyone, such as Willie Pearse and John MacBride; Thomas Kent did not come out at all—he was executed for the killing of a police officer during the raid on his house the week after the Rising. The most prominent leader to escape execution was Éamon de Valera, Commandant of the 3rd Battalion, who did so partly because of his American birth. Hobson went into hiding, re-emerging after the June amnesty, largely to scorn.

Most of the executions took place over a ten-day period:
* 3 May: Patrick Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh and Thomas Clarke
* 4 May: Joseph Plunkett, William Pearse, Edward Daly and Michael O&#x27;Hanrahan
* 5 May: John MacBride
* 8 May: Éamonn Ceannt, Michael Mallin, Seán Heuston and Con Colbert
* 12 May: James Connolly and Seán Mac Diarmada

The arrests greatly affected hundreds of families and communities; anti-English sentiment developed among the public, as separatists declared the arrests as indicative of a draconian approach. The public, at large, feared that the response was &quot;an assault on the entirety of the Irish national cause&quot;. This radical transformation was recognised in the moment and had become a point of concern among British authorities; after Connolly&#x27;s execution, the remaining death sentences were commuted to penal servitude. Growing support for republicanism can be found as early as June 1916; imprisonment largely failed to deter militants – interned rebels would proceed to fight at higher rates than those who weren&#x27;t – who thereafter quickly reorganised the movement.

==== Frongoch prison camp ====

Under Regulation 14B of the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 1,836 men were interned at internment camps and prisons in England and Wales. As urban areas were becoming the nexus for republicanism, Internees were largely from such areas. Many Internees had not taken part in the Rising; many thereafter became sympathetic to the nationalist cause.

Internees occupied themselves with the likes of lectures, craftwork, music and sports. These activities – which included games of Gaelic football, crafting of Gaelic symbols, and lessons in Irish – regularly had a nationalist character and the cause itself developed a sense of cohesion within the camps. The military studies included discussion of the Rising. Internment lasted until December of that year with releases having started in July. Martial law had ceased by the end of November.

Casement was tried in London for high treason and hanged at Pentonville Prison on 3 August.

=== British atrocities ===
On Tuesday 25 April, Dubliner Francis Sheehy Skeffington, a pacifist nationalist activist, was arrested and then taken as hostage and human shield by Captain John Bowen-Colthurst; that night Bowen-Colthurst shot dead a teenage boy. Skeffington was executed the next day – alongside two journalists. Two hours later, Bowen-Colthurst captured the Labour Party councillor and IRB lieutenant, Richard O&#x27;Carroll and had him shot in the street. Major Sir Francis Vane raised concerns over Bowen-Colthurst&#x27;s actions and saw to him being court martialled. Bowen-Colthurst was found guilty but insane and was sentenced to an insane asylum. Owing to political pressure, an inquiry soon transpired, revealing the murders and their cover-up. The killing of Skeffington and others provoked outrage among citizens.

The other incident was the &quot;North King Street Massacre&quot;. On the night of 28–29 April, British soldiers of the South Staffordshire Regiment, under Colonel Henry Taylor, had burst into houses on North King Street and killed fifteen male civilians whom they accused of being rebels. The soldiers shot or bayoneted the victims, and then secretly buried some of them in cellars or backyards after robbing them. The area saw some of the fiercest fighting of the Rising and the British had taken heavy casualties for little gain. Maxwell attempted to excuse the killings and argued that the rebels were ultimately responsible. He claimed that &quot;the rebels wore no uniform&quot; and that the people of North King Street were rebel sympathisers. Maxwell concluded that such incidents &quot;are absolutely unavoidable in such a business as this&quot; and that &quot;under the circumstance the troops [...] behaved with the greatest restraint&quot;. A private brief, prepared for the Prime Minister, said the soldiers &quot;had orders not to take any prisoners&quot; but took it to mean they were to shoot any suspected rebel. The City Coroner&#x27;s inquest found that soldiers had killed &quot;unarmed and unoffending&quot; residents. The military court of inquiry ruled that no specific soldiers could be held responsible, and no action was taken.

=== Inquiry ===
A Royal Commission was set up to enquire into the causes of the Rising. It began hearings on 18 May under the chairmanship of Lord Hardinge of Penshurst. The Commission heard evidence from Sir Matthew Nathan, Augustine Birrell, Lord Wimborne, Sir Neville Chamberlain (Inspector-General of the Royal Irish Constabulary), General Lovick Friend, Major Ivor Price of Military Intelligence and others. The report, published on 26 June, was critical of the Dublin administration, saying that &quot;Ireland for several years had been administered on the principle that it was safer and more expedient to leave the law in abeyance if collision with any faction of the Irish people could thereby be avoided.&quot; Birrell and Nathan had resigned immediately after the Rising. Wimborne resisted the pressure to resign, but was recalled to London by Asquith. He was re-appointed in July 1916. Chamberlain also resigned.

=== Reaction of the Dublin public ===
At first, many Dubliners were bewildered by the outbreak of the Rising. James Stephens, who was in Dublin during the week, thought, &quot;None of these people were prepared for Insurrection. The thing had been sprung on them so suddenly they were unable to take sides.&quot; Eyewitnesses compared the ruin of Dublin with the destruction of towns in Europe in the war: the physical damage, which included over ninety fires, was largely confined to Sackville Street. In the immediate aftermath, the Irish government was in disarray.

There was great hostility towards the Volunteers in some parts of the city which escalated to physical violence in some instances. Historian Keith Jeffery noted that most of the opposition came from the dependents of British Army personnel. The death and destruction, which resulted in disrupted trade, considerable looting and unemployment, contributed to the antagonism of the Volunteers, who were denounced as &quot;murderers&quot; and &quot;starvers of the people&quot; – the monetary consequences of the Rising were estimated to be at £2,500,000. International aid was supplied to residents – nationalists aided the dependents of Volunteers. The British Government compensated the consequences to the sum of £2,500,000.

Support for the rebels did exist among Dubliners, expressed through both crowds cheering at prisoners and reverent silence. With martial law seeing this expression prosecuted, many would-be supporters elected to remain silent although &quot;a strong undercurrent of disloyalty&quot; was still felt. Drawing upon this support, and amidst the deluge of nationalist ephemera, the significantly popular &quot;Catholic Bulletin&quot; eulogised Volunteers killed in action and implored readers to donate; entertainment was offered as an extension of those intentions, targeting local sectors to great success. The &quot;Bulletin&quot;&#x27;s Catholic character allowed it to evade the widespread censorship of press and seizure of republican propaganda; it therefore exposed many unaware readers to such propaganda.

=== Rise of Sinn Féin ===
A meeting called by Count Plunkett on 19 April 1917 led to the formation of a broad political movement under the banner of Sinn Féin which was formalised at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis of 25 October 1917. The Conscription Crisis of 1918 further intensified public support for Sinn Féin before the general elections to the British Parliament on 14 December 1918, which resulted in a landslide victory for Sinn Féin, winning 73 seats out of 105, whose Members of Parliament (MPs) gathered in Dublin on 21 January 1919 to form Dáil Éireann and adopt the Declaration of Independence.

During that election, they drew directly upon the Rising and their popularity was significantly accreditable to that association, one that accrued political prestige until the end of the century. Many participants of the Rising would soon assume electoral positions. Sinn Féin served as an alternative to the Irish Parliamentary Party whose support for British establishments alienated voters.

Sinn Féin would become closely aligned with the Irish Republican Army, who sought to continue the IRB&#x27;s ideals and waged armed conflict against British forces.

== Legacy ==

1916 – containing both the Rising and the Battle of the Somme, events paramount to the memory of Irish Republicans and Ulster Unionists, respectively – had a profound effect on Ireland and is remembered accordingly. The Rising was among the events that ended colonial rule in Ireland, succeeded by the Irish War of Independence. The legacy of the Rising possess many dimensions although the declaration of the Republic and the ensuing executions remain focal points.

Annual parades in celebration of the Rising occurred for many years, however, ceased after The Troubles in Northern Ireland began, being seen as supportive of republican paramilitary violence – the Rising is a common feature of republican murals in Northern Ireland. These commemorations celebrated the Rising as the origin of the Irish state, a stance reiterated through extensive analysis. Unionists contend that the Rising was an illegal attack on the British State that should not be celebrated. Revivalism of the parades has inspired significant public debate, although the centenary of the Rising, which featured the likes of ceremonies and memorials, was largely successful and praised for its sensitivity.

The leaders of the Rising were &quot;instantly apotheosized&quot; and remembrance was situated within a larger republican tradition of claimed martyrdom – the Catholic Church would contend this narrative as the foundational myth of the Irish Free State, assuming a place within the remembrance as an association between republicanism and Catholicism grew. The &quot;Pearsean combination of Catholicism, Gaelicism, and spiritual nationalism&quot; would become dominant within republicanism, the ideas gaining a quasi-religiosity, whilst helping unify later strands thereof. Within the Free State, the Rising was sanctified by officials, positioned as a &quot;highly disciplined military operation&quot;. Historians largely agree that the Rising succeeded by offering a symbolic display of sacrifice, while the military action was a considerable failure. As Monk Gibbon remarked, the &quot;shots from khaki-uniformed firing parties did more to create the Republic of Ireland than any shot fired by a Volunteer in the course of Easter week&quot;.

Literature surrounding the Rising was significant: MacDonagh, Plunkett, and Pearse were themselves poets, whose ideals were granted a spiritual dimension in their work; Arnold Bax, Francis Ledwidge, George William Russell and W. B. Yeats responded through verse that ranged from endorsement to elegies. Although James Joyce was ambivalent to the insurgence, metaphors of and imagery consistent with the Rising appear in his later work. Hugh Leonard, Denis Johnston, Tom Murphy, Roddy Doyle and Sorley MacLean are among writers would later invoke the Rising. Now extensively dramatised, its theatricality was identified in the moment and has been stressed in its remembrance. Literary and political evocation position the Rising as a &quot;watershed moment&quot; central to Irish history.

Black, Basque, Breton, Catalan and Indian nationalists have drawn upon the Rising and its consequences. For the latter, Jawaharlal Nehru noted, the symbolic display was the appeal, that of the transcendent, &quot;invincible spirit of a nation&quot;; such was broadly appealing in America, where diasporic, occasionally socialist, nationalism occurred. Vladimir Lenin was effusive, ascribing its anti-imperialism a singular significance within geopolitics – his only misgiving was its estrangement from the broader wave of revolution occurring.

During the Troubles, significant revisionism of the Rising occurred. Revisionists contended that it was not a &quot;heroic drama&quot; as thought but rather informed the violence transpiring, by having legitimised a &quot;cult of &#x27;blood sacrifice&#x27;&quot;. With the advent of a Provisional IRA ceasefire and the beginning of what became known as the Peace Process during the 1990s, the government&#x27;s view of the Rising grew more positive and in 1996 an 80th anniversary commemoration at the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin was attended by the Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael, John Bruton.

<text>Eschrichtiidae or the gray whales is a family of baleen whale (Parvorder Mysticeti) with a single extant species, the gray whale (&quot;Eschrichtius robustus&quot;), as well as four described fossil genera: &quot;Archaeschrichtius&quot; (Miocene), &quot;Glaucobalaena&quot; and &quot;Eschrichtioides&quot; (Pliocene) from Italy, and &quot;Gricetoides&quot; from the Pliocene of North Carolina. Some phylogenetic studies have found this family to be invalid, with its members nesting inside of the clade Balaenopteridae. The names of the extant genus and the family honours Danish zoologist Daniel Eschricht.

==Taxonomy==
In his morphological analysis, found that eschrichtiids and Cetotheriidae (&quot;Cetotherium&quot;, &quot;Mixocetus&quot; and &quot;Metopocetus&quot;) form a monophyletic sister group of Balaenopteridae.

A specimen from the Late Pliocene of Northern Italy, named &quot;&quot;Cetotherium&quot; gastaldii&quot; by and renamed &quot;&quot;Balaenoptera&quot; gastaldii&quot; by , was identified as a basal eschrichtiid by who recombined it to &quot;Eschrichtioides gastaldii&quot;.

 found that the gray whale is phylogenetically distinct from rorquals and that previous morphological studies were correct in the conclusion that the evolution of gulp feeding was a single event in the rorqual lineage. In contrast, multiple later studies found the gray whale to fall within the family Balaenopteridae, being more derived than the minke whales but basal to all other members in the family, and reclassified it in Balaenopteridae; the American Society of Mammalogists has followed this classification.

==Evolution==
Fossils of Eschrichtiidae have been found in all major oceanic basins in the Northern Hemisphere, and the family is believed το date back to the Late Miocene. Today, gray whales are only present in the northern Pacific, but a population was also present in the northern Atlantic before being driven to extinction by European whalers three centuries ago.

Fossil eschrichtiids from before the Holocene are rare compared to other fossil mysticetes. The only Pleistocene fossil from the Pacific referred to &quot;E. eschrichtius&quot; is a partial skeleton and an associated skull from California, estimated to be about 200 thousand years old. However, a late Pliocene fossil from Hokkaido, Japan, referred to &quot;Eschrichtius&quot; sp. is estimated to be and a similar unnamed fossil has been reported from California.

In their description of &quot;Archaeschrichtius ruggieroi&quot; from the late Miocene of Italy, argued that eschrichtiids most likely originated in the Mediterranean Basin about and remained there, either permanently or intermittently, at least until the Early Pliocene (5–3 Mya), (but see Messinian salinity crisis.)

<text>Edmund I or Eadmund I (920/921 – 26 May 946) was King of the English from 27 October 939 until his death in 946. He was the elder son of King Edward the Elder and his third wife, Queen Eadgifu, and a grandson of King Alfred the Great. After Edward died in 924, he was succeeded by his eldest son, Edmund&#x27;s half-brother Æthelstan. Edmund was crowned after Æthelstan died childless in 939. He had two sons, Eadwig and Edgar, by his first wife Ælfgifu, and none by his second wife Æthelflæd. His sons were young children when he was killed in a brawl with an outlaw at Pucklechurch in Gloucestershire, and he was succeeded by his younger brother Eadred, who died in 955 and was followed by Edmund&#x27;s sons in succession.

Æthelstan had succeeded as the king of England south of the Humber and he became the first king of all England when he conquered Viking-ruled York in 927, but after his death Anlaf Guthfrithson was accepted as King of York and extended Viking rule to the Five Boroughs of north-east Mercia. Edmund was initially forced to accept the reverse, the first major setback for the West Saxon dynasty since Alfred&#x27;s reign, but he was able to recover his position following Anlaf&#x27;s death in 941. In 942, Edmund took back control of the Five Boroughs and in 944 he regained control over the whole of England when he expelled the Viking kings of York. Eadred had to deal with further revolts when he became king, and York was not finally conquered until 954. Æthelstan had achieved a dominant position over other British kings and Edmund maintained this, perhaps apart from Scotland. The north Welsh king Idwal Foel may have allied with the Vikings as he was killed by the English in 942. The British kingdom of Strathclyde may also have sided with the Vikings as Edmund ravaged it in 945 and then ceded it to Malcolm I of Scotland. Edmund also continued his brother&#x27;s friendly relations with Continental rulers, several of whom were married to his half-sisters.

Edmund inherited his brother&#x27;s interests and leading advisers, such as Oda, whom he appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 941, Æthelstan Half-King, ealdorman of East Anglia, and Ælfheah the Bald, Bishop of Winchester. Government at the local level was mainly carried on by ealdormen, and Edmund made substantial changes in personnel during his reign, with a move from Æthelstan&#x27;s main reliance on West Saxons to a greater prominence of men with Mercian connections. Unlike the close relatives of previous kings, his mother and brother attested many of Edmund&#x27;s charters, suggesting a high degree of family cooperation. Edmund was also an active legislator, and three of his codes survive. Provisions include ones which attempt to regulate feuds and emphasise the sanctity of the royal person.

The major religious movement of the tenth century, the English Benedictine Reform, reached its peak under Edgar, but Edmund&#x27;s reign was important in its early stages. He appointed Dunstan abbot of Glastonbury, where he was joined by Æthelwold. They were to be two of the leaders of the reform and they made the abbey the first important centre for disseminating it. Unlike the circle of his son Edgar, Edmund did not take the view that Benedictine monasticism was the only worthwhile religious life, and he also patronised unreformed (non-Benedictine) establishments.

== Background ==
In the ninth century the four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria and East Anglia came under increasing attack from Vikings, culminating in invasion by the Great Heathen Army in 865. By 878, the Vikings had overrun East Anglia, Northumbria, and Mercia, and nearly conquered Wessex, but in that year the West Saxons fought back under Alfred the Great and achieved a decisive victory at the Battle of Edington. In the 880s and 890s, the Anglo-Saxons ruled Wessex and western Mercia, but the rest of England was under Viking kings. Alfred constructed a network of fortresses, and these helped him to frustrate renewed Viking attacks in the 890s with the assistance of his son-in-law, Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, and his elder son Edward, who became king when Alfred died in 899. In 909, Edward sent a force of West Saxons and Mercians to attack the Northumbrian Danes, and the following year the Danes retaliated with a raid on Mercia. While they were marching back to Northumbria, they were caught by an Anglo-Saxon army and decisively defeated at the Battle of Tettenhall, ending the threat from the Northumbrian Vikings for a generation. In the 910s, Edward and Æthelflæd, his sister and Æthelred&#x27;s widow, extended Alfred&#x27;s network of fortresses and conquered Viking-ruled eastern Mercia and East Anglia. When Edward died in 924, he controlled all England south of the Humber.

Edward was succeeded by his eldest son Æthelstan, who seized control of Northumbria in 927, thus becoming the first king of all England. He then styled himself in charters as king of the English, and soon afterwards Welsh kings and the kings of Scotland and Strathclyde acknowledged his overlordship. After this, he adopted more grandiose titles such as (king of the whole of Britain). In 934 he invaded Scotland and in 937 an alliance of armies of Scotland, Strathclyde and the Vikings invaded England. Æthelstan secured a decisive victory at the Battle of Brunanburh, cementing his dominant position in Britain.

Benedictine monasticism had flourished in England in the seventh and eighth centuries, but it severely declined in the late eighth and ninth centuries. By the time Alfred came to the throne in 871, monasteries and knowledge of Latin were at a low ebb, but there was a gradual revival from Alfred&#x27;s time onwards. This accelerated during Æthelstan&#x27;s reign, and two leaders of the later tenth-century English Benedictine Reform, Dunstan and Æthelwold, reached maturity in Æthelstan&#x27;s cosmopolitan, intellectual court of the 930s.

== Family and early life ==
Edmund&#x27;s father, Edward the Elder, had three wives, eight or nine daughters, several of whom married Continental royalty, and five sons. Æthelstan was the only known son of Edward&#x27;s first wife, Ecgwynn. His second wife, Ælfflæd, had two sons: Ælfweard, who may have been acknowledged in Wessex as king when his father died in 924 but who died less than a month later, and Edwin, who drowned in 933. In about 919, Edward married Eadgifu, the daughter of Sigehelm, ealdorman of Kent. Edmund, who was born in 920 or 921, was Eadgifu&#x27;s elder son. Her younger son Eadred succeeded him as king. Edmund had one or two full sisters. Eadburh was a nun at Winchester who was later venerated as a saint. The twelfth-century historian William of Malmesbury gives Edmund a second full sister who married Louis, prince of Aquitaine; she was called Eadgifu, the same name as her mother. William&#x27;s account is accepted by the historians Ann Williams and Sean Miller, but Æthelstan&#x27;s biographer Sarah Foot argues that she did not exist, and that William confused her with Ælfgifu, a daughter of Ælfflæd.

Edmund was a young child when his half-brother Æthelstan became king in 924. He grew up at Æthelstan&#x27;s court, probably with two important Continental exiles, his nephew Louis, future King of the West Franks, and Alain, future Duke of Brittany. According to William of Malmesbury, Æthelstan showed great affection towards Edmund and Eadred: &quot;mere infants at his father&#x27;s death, he brought them up lovingly in childhood, and when they grew up gave them a share in his kingdom&quot;. Edmund may have been a member of the expedition to Scotland in 934 as, according to the (History of Saint Cuthbert), Æthelstan instructed that in the event of his death Edmund was to take his body to Cuthbert&#x27;s shrine at Chester-le-Street. Edmund fought at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937, and in a poem commemorating the victory in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (&quot;ASC&quot;), Edmund (prince of the royal house) is given such a prominent role – and praised for his heroism alongside Æthelstan – that the historian Simon Walker has suggested that the poem was written during Edmund&#x27;s reign. At a royal assembly shortly before Æthelstan&#x27;s death in 939, Edmund and Eadred attested a grant to their full sister, Eadburh, both as (king&#x27;s brother). Their attestations may have been because of the family connection, but they also may have been intended to display the throneworthiness of the king&#x27;s half-brothers when it was known that he did not have long to live. This is the only charter of Æthelstan attested by Edmund, the authenticity of which has not been questioned. Æthelstan died childless on 27 October 939 and Edmund&#x27;s succession to the throne was undisputed. He was the first king to succeed to the throne of all England, and was probably crowned at Kingston-upon-Thames, perhaps on Advent Sunday, 1 December 939.

== Reign ==
=== The loss and recovery of the north ===
Brunanburh saved England from destruction as a united kingdom, and it helped to ensure that Edmund would succeed smoothly to the throne, but it did not preserve him from challenges to his rule once he became king. The chronology of the Viking challenge is disputed, but according to the most widely accepted version, Æthelstan&#x27;s death encouraged the York Vikings to accept the kingship of Anlaf Guthfrithson, the King of Dublin who had led the Viking forces defeated at Brunanburh. According to &quot;ASC D&quot;: &quot;Here the Northumbrians belied their pledges and chose Anlaf from Ireland as their king.&quot; Anlaf was in York by the end of 939 and the following year he invaded north-east Mercia, aiming to recover the southern territories of the York kingdom which had been conquered by Edward and Æthelflæd. He marched on Northampton, where he was repulsed, and then stormed the ancient Mercian royal centre of Tamworth, with considerable loss of life on both sides. On his way back north he was caught at Leicester by an army under Edmund, but battle was averted by the mediation of Archbishop Wulfstan of York, on behalf of the Vikings, and probably the Archbishop of Canterbury acting for the English. They arranged a treaty at Leicester which surrendered the Five Boroughs of Lincoln, Leicester, Nottingham, Stamford and Derby, to Guthfrithson. This was the first serious setback for the English since Edward the Elder began to roll back Viking conquests in the early tenth century, and it was described by the historian Frank Stenton as &quot;an ignominious surrender&quot;. Guthfrithson had coins struck at York with the lower Viking weight than the English standard.

Guthfrithson died in 941, allowing Edmund to reverse his losses. In 942, he recovered the Five Boroughs, and his victory was considered so significant that it was commemorated by a poem in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;:

Like other tenth century poems in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, this one shows a concern with English nationalism and the West Saxon royal dynasty, and in this case displays the Christian English and Danes as united under Edmund in their victorious opposition to Norse (Norwegian) pagans. Stenton commented that the poem brings out the highly significant fact that the Danes of eastern Mercia, after fifteen years of Æthelstan&#x27;s government, had come to regard themselves as the rightful subjects of the English king. Above all, it emphasises the antagonism between Danes and Norsemen, which is often ignored by modern writers, but underlies the whole history of England in this period. It is the first political poem in the English language, and its author understood political realities.

However, Williams is sceptical, arguing that the poem is not contemporary, and that it is doubtful whether contemporaries saw their situation in those terms. In the same year, Edmund granted large estates in northern Mercia to a leading nobleman, Wulfsige the Black, continuing the policy of his father of granting land in the Danelaw to supporters in order to give them an interest in resisting the Vikings.

Guthfrithson was succeeded as king of York by his cousin, Anlaf Sihtricson, who was baptised in 943 with Edmund as his godfather, suggesting that he accepted West Saxon overlordship. Sihtricson issued his own coinage, but he clearly had rivals in York as coins were also issued there in two other names: Ragnall, a brother of Anlaf Guthfrithson who also accepted baptism under Edmund&#x27;s sponsorship, and an otherwise unknown Sihtric. The coins of all three men were issued with the same design, which may suggest joint authority. In 944, Edmund expelled the Viking rulers of York and seized control of the city with the assistance of Archbishop Wulfstan, who had previously supported the Vikings, and an ealdorman in Mercia, probably Æthelmund, who had been appointed by Edmund in 940.

When Edmund died, his successor Eadred faced further revolts in Northumbria, which were not finally defeated until 954. In Miller&#x27;s view, Edmund&#x27;s reign &quot;shows clearly that although Æthelstan had conquered Northumbria, it was still not really part of a united England, nor would it be until the end of Eadred&#x27;s reign&quot;. The Northumbrians&#x27; repeated revolts show that they retained separatist ambitions, which they only abandoned under pressure from successive southern kings. Unlike Æthelstan, Edmund and Eadred rarely claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Britain, although each did sometimes describe himself as &#x27;king of the English&#x27; even at times when he did not control Northumbria. In charters, Edmund sometimes even called himself by the lesser title of &quot;king of the Anglo-Saxons&quot; in 940 and 942, and only claimed to be king of all Britain once he had gained full control over Northumbria in 945. He never described himself as on his coinage.

=== Relations with other British kingdoms ===
Edmund inherited overlordship over the kings of Wales from Æthelstan, but Idwal Foel, king of Gwynedd in north Wales, apparently took advantage of Edmund&#x27;s early weakness to withhold fealty and may have supported Anlaf Guthfrithson, as according to the , he was killed by the English in 942. Between 942 and 950 his kingdom was conquered by Hywel Dda, the king of Deheubarth in south Wales, who is described by the historian of Wales Thomas Charles-Edwards as &quot;the firmest ally of the English &quot;emperors of Britain&quot; among all the kings of his day&quot;. Attestations of Welsh kings to English charters appear to have been rare compared with those in Æthelstan&#x27;s reign, but in the historian David Dumville&#x27;s view there is no reason to doubt that Edmund retained his overlordship over the Welsh kings. In a charter of 944 disposing of land in Devon, Edmund is styled &quot;King of the English and ruler of this British province&quot;, suggesting that the former British kingdom of Dumnonia was still not regarded as fully integrated into England, although the historian Simon Keynes &quot;suspects some &#x27;local&#x27; interference&quot; in the wording of Edmund&#x27;s title.

By 945, both Scotland and Strathclyde had kings who had assumed the throne since Brunanburh, and it is likely that whereas Scotland allied with England, Strathclyde held to its alliance with the Vikings. In that year Edmund ravaged Strathclyde. According to the thirteenth century chronicler Roger of Wendover, the invasion was supported by Hywel Dda, and Edmund had two sons of the king of Strathclyde blinded, perhaps to deprive their father of throneworthy heirs. Edmund then gave the kingdom to Malcolm I of Scotland in return for a pledge to defend it on land and on sea, a decision variously interpreted by historians. Dumville and Charles-Edwards regard it as granting Strathclyde to the Scottish king in return for an acknowledgement of Edmund&#x27;s overlordship, whereas Williams thinks it probably means that he agreed to Malcolm&#x27;s overlordship of the area in return for an alliance against the Dublin Vikings, and Stenton and Miller see it as recognition by Edmund that Northumbria was the northern limit of Anglo-Saxon England.

According to the hagiography of a Gaelic monk called Cathróe, he travelled through England on his journey from Scotland to the Continent; Edmund summoned him to court and Oda, Archbishop of Canterbury, then ceremonially conducted him to his ship at Lympne. Travelling clerics played an important part in the circulation of manuscripts and ideas in this period, and Cathróe is unlikely to have been the only Celtic cleric at Edmund&#x27;s court.

Edmund inherited strong Continental contacts from Æthelstan&#x27;s cosmopolitan court, and these were enhanced by their sisters&#x27; marriages to foreign kings and princes. Edmund carried on his brother&#x27;s Continental policies and maintained his alliances, especially with his nephew King Louis IV of West Francia and Otto I, King of East Francia and future Holy Roman Emperor. Louis was both nephew and brother-in-law of Otto, while Otto and Edmund were brothers-in-law. There were almost certainly extensive diplomatic contacts between Edmund and Continental rulers which have not been recorded, but it is known that Otto sent delegations to Edmund&#x27;s court. In the early 940s, some Norman lords sought the help of the Danish prince Harald against Louis, and in 945 Harald captured Louis and handed him to Hugh the Great, Duke of the Franks, who kept him prisoner. Edmund and Otto both protested and demanded his immediate release, but this only took place in exchange for the surrender of the town of Laon to Hugh.

Edmund&#x27;s name is in the confraternity book of Pfäfers Abbey in Switzerland, perhaps at the request of Archbishop Oda when staying there on his way to or from Rome to collect his pallium. As with the diplomatic delegations, this probably represents rare surviving evidence of extensive contacts between English and Continental churchmen which continued from Æthelstan&#x27;s reign.

=== Administration ===
Edmund inherited his brother&#x27;s interests and leading advisers, such as Æthelstan Half-King, ealdorman of East Anglia, Ælfheah the Bald, bishop of Winchester, and Oda, bishop of Ramsbury, who was appointed as Archbishop of Canterbury by Edmund in 941. Æthelstan Half-King first witnessed a charter as an ealdorman in 932, and within three years of Edmund&#x27;s accession he had been joined by two of his brothers as ealdormen; their territories covered more than half of England and his wife fostered the future King Edgar. The historian Cyril Hart compares the brothers&#x27; power during Edmund&#x27;s reign to that of the Godwins a century later. Edmund&#x27;s mother, Eadgifu, who had been in eclipse during her step-son&#x27;s reign, was also very influential.

For the first half of 940, there were no changes in the attestations of ealdormen compared with the end of Æthelstan&#x27;s reign, but later in the year the number of ealdormen was doubled from four to eight, with three of the new ealdormen covering Mercian districts. There was an increased reliance on the family of Æthelstan Half-King, which was enriched by grants in 942. The appointments may have been part of Edmund&#x27;s measures to deal with Anlaf&#x27;s incursion.

Eadgifu and Eadred attested many of Edmund&#x27;s charters, showing a high degree of family cooperation; initially Eadgifu attested first, but from sometime in late 943 or early 944 Eadred took precedence, perhaps reflecting his growing authority. Eadgifu attested around one third, always as (king&#x27;s mother), including all grants to religious institutions and individuals. Eadred attested over half of his brother&#x27;s charters. Eadgifu&#x27;s and Eadred&#x27;s prominence in charter attestations is unparalleled by any other West Saxon king&#x27;s mother and male relative.

=== Charters ===
The period from around 925 to 975 was the golden age of Anglo-Saxon royal charters, when they were at their peak as instruments of royal government, and the scribes who drew up most of Edmund&#x27;s charters constituted a royal secretariat which he inherited from his brother. From 928 until 935, charters were produced by the very learned scribe designated by scholars as Æthelstan A in a highly elaborate style. Keynes comments: &quot;It is only by dwelling on the glories and complexities of the diplomas drafted and written by Æthelstan A that one can appreciate the elegant simplicity of the diplomas that followed.&quot; A scribe known as Edmund C wrote an inscription in a gospel book (BL Cotton Tiberius A. ii folio 15v) during Æthelstan&#x27;s reign and wrote charters for Edmund and Eadred between 944 and 949.

Most of Edmund&#x27;s charters belong to the diplomatic &quot;mainstream&quot;, including those of Edmund C, but four are part of a group, dating mainly to Eadred&#x27;s reign, called the &#x27;alliterative charters&#x27;. They were drafted by a very learned scholar, almost certainly someone in the circle of Cenwald, Bishop of Worcester, or perhaps the bishop himself. These charters are characterised both by a high proportion of words starting with the same letter and by the use of unusual words. Ben Snook describes the charters as &quot;impressive literary works&quot;, and like much of the writing of the period their style displays the influence of Aldhelm, a leading scholar and early eighth century bishop of Sherborne.

=== Coinage ===
The only coin in common use in the tenth century was the penny. The main coin designs in Edmund&#x27;s reign were H (Horizontal) types, with a cross or other decoration on the obverse surrounded by a circular inscription including the king&#x27;s name, and the moneyer&#x27;s name horizontally on the reverse. There were also substantial numbers of BC (Bust Crowned) types in East Anglia and the Danish shires; these had a portrait of the king, often crudely drawn, on the obverse. For a period in Æthelstan&#x27;s reign many coins showed the mint town, but this had become rare by the time of Edmund&#x27;s accession, except in Norwich, where it continued during the 940s for BC types.

After the reign of Edward the Elder there was a slight decline in the weight of coins under Æthelstan, and the deterioration increased after around 940, continuing until Edgar&#x27;s reform of the coinage in around 973. However, based on a very small sample, there is no evidence of a decline in the silver content under Edmund. His reign saw an increase in regional diversity of the coinage which lasted for twenty years until a return to relative unity of design early in Edgar&#x27;s reign.

=== Legislation ===
Three law codes of Edmund survive, carrying on Æthelstan&#x27;s tradition of legal reform. They are called I Edmund, II Edmund and III Edmund. The order in which they were issued is clear, but not the dates of issue. I Edmund is concerned with ecclesiastical matters, while the other codes deal with public order.

I Edmund was promulgated at a council in London convened by Edmund and attended by archbishops Oda and Wulfstan. The code is very similar to &quot;Constitutions&quot; previously promulgated by Oda. Uncelibate clerics were threatened with the loss of property and forbidden burial in consecrated ground, and there were also provisions regarding church dues and the restoration of church property. A clause forbidding a murderer from coming into the neighbourhood of the king, unless he had done penance for his crime, reflected an increasing emphasis on the sanctity of kingship. Edmund was one of the few Anglo-Saxon kings to promulgate laws concerned with sorcery and idolatry, and the code condemns false witness and the use of magical drugs. The association between perjury and the use of drugs in magic was traditional, probably because they both involved the breaking of a religious oath.

In II Edmund, the king and his counsellors are stated to be &quot;greatly distressed by the manifold illegal deeds of violence which are in our midst&quot;, and aimed to promote &quot;peace and concord&quot;. The main focus is on regulating and controlling blood feuds. The authorities () are required to put a stop to vendettas following murders: the killer should instead pay (compensation) to the relatives of the victim. If no wergeld is paid, the killer has to bear the feud, but attacks on him are forbidden in churches and royal manor houses. If the killer&#x27;s kin abandon him and refuse to contribute to a wergeld and to protect him, then it is the king&#x27;s will that they are to be exempt from the feud: any of the victim&#x27;s kin taking vengeance on them shall incur the hostility of the king and his friends and shall lose all their possessions. In the view of the historian Dorothy Whitelock the need for legislation to control the feud was partly due to the influx of Danish settlers who believed that it was more manly to pursue a vendetta than to settle a dispute by accepting compensation. Several Scandinavian loan words are first recorded in this code, such as , the crime of attacking a homestead; the penalty is loss of all the offender&#x27;s property, while the king decides whether he also loses his life. Scandinavian loan words are not found in Edmund&#x27;s other codes, and this one may have been particularly aimed at his Danish subjects. In contrast to Edmund&#x27;s concern about the level of violence, he congratulated his people on their success in suppressing thefts. The code encourages greater local initiative in upholding the law, while emphasising Edmund&#x27;s royal dignity and authority.

The relationship between Anglo-Saxon kings and their leading men was personal; kings were lords and protectors in return for pledges of loyalty and obedience, and this is spelled out in terms based on Carolingian legislation for the first time in III Edmund, issued at Colyton in Devon. This requires that &quot;all shall swear in the name of the Lord, before whom that holy thing is holy, that they will be faithful to King Edmund, even as it behooves a man to be faithful to his lord, without any dispute or dissension, openly or in secret, favouring what he favours and discountenancing what he discountenances.&quot; The threat of divine retribution was important in a society which had limited coercive power to punish law breaking and disloyalty. The military historian Richard Abels argues that &quot;all&quot; () shall swear does not mean literally all, but should be understood to mean those men qualified to take oaths administered by royal reeves at shire courts, that is the middling and great landholders, and that Edmund&#x27;s oath united his diverse peoples by binding them all to him personally. The emphasis on lordship is further seen in provisions setting out the duties of lords to take responsibility for their followers and stand surety for them.

III Edmund was also concerned to prevent theft, especially cattle rustling. The local community is required to cooperate in catching thieves, dead or alive, and to assist in tracking down stolen cattle, while trading had to be witnessed by a high reeve, priest, treasurer or port reeve. According to a provision described by the legal historian Patrick Wormald as gruesome: &quot;we have declared with regard to slaves that, if a number of them commit theft, their leader shall be captured and slain, or hanged, and each of the others shall be scourged three times and have his scalp removed and his little finger mutilated as a token of his guilt&quot;. The code has the first reference to the hundred as an administrative unit of local government in a provision requiring anyone who refuses to assist in the apprehension of a thief to pay 120 shillings to the king and 30 shillings to the hundred.

Williams comments &quot;In both the second code and the Colyton legislation, the functions of the four pillars of medieval society, kingship, lordship, family and neighbourhood, are clearly evident.&quot; Wormald describes the codes as &quot;an object-lesson in the variety of Anglo-Saxon legal texts&quot;, but he sees what they have in common as more important, especially a heightened rhetorical tone which extends to treating murder as an affront to the royal person. The historian Alaric Trousdale sees &quot;explicit funding of local administrative institutions and the greater empowerment of local officials in the application of the law&quot; as original contributions of Edmund&#x27;s legislation. Edmund is listed in laws of his grandson Æthelred the Unready as one of the wise law-givers of the past.

=== Religion ===
The major religious movement of the tenth century, the English Benedictine Reform, reached its peak under Edgar, but Edmund&#x27;s reign was important in the early stages, which were led by Oda and Ælfheah, both of whom were monks. Oda had strong connections with Continental centres of reform, especially Fleury Abbey. He had been a leading counsellor of Æthelstan and had helped to negotiate the return of Louis to France as king of the Franks in 936. Dunstan was to be a key figure in the reform and Archbishop of Canterbury, and according to his first biographer he was a leading figure at Edmund&#x27;s court until his enemies persuaded Edmund to expel him, only for the king to have a change of heart after a narrow escape from death and give him a royal estate at Glastonbury, including its abbey. Williams rejects the story because there is no evidence that he was influential in this period; his brother attested charters, but he did not. Edmund may have given Dunstan the abbey to keep him at a distance because he was too much of a disruptive influence at court. He was joined by Æthelwold, another future reform leader, and they spent much of the next decade studying Benedictine texts at Glastonbury, which became the first centre for disseminating monastic reform.

Edmund visited the shrine of St Cuthbert in Chester-le-Street church, probably on his way to Scotland in 945. He prayed at the shrine and commended himself and his army to the saint. His men gave 60 pounds to the shrine, and Edmund placed two gold bracelets on the saint&#x27;s body and wrapped two costly (lengths of Greek cloth) around it. One of the was probably an excellent Byzantine silk found in Cuthbert&#x27;s tomb known as the &quot;Nature Goddess silk&quot;. He also &quot;granted peace and law better than any it ever had to the whole territory of St Cuthbert&quot;. Edmund&#x27;s show of respect and support for the shrine reflected both the political power of the community of St Cuthbert in the north and southern reverence for him. According to William of Malmesbury, Edmund brought the relics of important Northumbrian saints such as Aidan south to Glastonbury Abbey.

Another sign of the religious revival was the number of aristocratic women who adopted a religious life. Several received grants from Edmund, including a nun called Ælfgyth, who was a patron of Wilton Abbey, and Wynflæd, the mother of Edmund&#x27;s first wife. Æthelstan had granted two estates to religious women, Edmund made seven such grants and Eadred four. After this the practice ceased abruptly, apart from one further donation. The significance of the donations is uncertain, but the most likely explanation is that in the mid-tenth century some religious aristocratic women were granted the estates so that they could choose how to pursue their vocation, whether by establishing a nunnery or living a religious life in their own homes.

In the reign of Edmund&#x27;s son Edgar, Æthelwold and his circle insisted that Benedictine monasticism was the only worthwhile form of religious life, but this was not the view of earlier kings such as Edmund. He was concerned to support religion, but was not committed to a particular ideology of religious development. In his grants, he continued Æthelstan&#x27;s policies. When Gérard of Brogne reformed the Abbey of Saint Bertin by imposing the Benedictine rule in 944, monks who rejected the changes fled to England and Edmund gave them a church owned by the crown at Bath. He may have had personal motives for his assistance, as the monks had given burial to his half-brother, Edwin, who had drowned at sea in 933, but the incident shows that Edmund did not see only one monastic rule as valid. He may also have granted privileges to the unreformed (non-Benedictine) Bury St Edmunds Abbey, but the charter&#x27;s authenticity is disputed.

=== Learning ===
Latin learning revived in Æthelstan&#x27;s reign, influenced by Continental models and by the hermeneutic style of the leading seventh century scholar and Bishop of Sherborne, Aldhelm. The revival continued in Edmund&#x27;s reign, and Welsh book production became increasingly influential. Welsh manuscripts were studied and copied, and they influenced the early use of Carolingian minuscule script in England, although Continental sources are also important. Edmund&#x27;s reign also saw the development of a new style of the native square minuscule script, which was used in mid-century royal diplomas. Oda&#x27;s school at Canterbury was praised by post-Conquest chroniclers, especially for the presence there of Frithegod, a brilliant Continental scholar and the most skilful poet in mid-tenth century England. The &quot;Vatican&quot; recension of the was produced in England in Edmund&#x27;s reign, probably in 944.

== Marriages and children ==
Edmund probably married his first wife Ælfgifu around the time of his accession to the throne, as their second son was born in 943. Their sons Eadwig and Edgar both became kings of England. Ælfgifu&#x27;s father is not known, but her mother is identified by a charter of Edgar which confirms a grant by his grandmother Wynflæd of land to Shaftesbury Abbey. Ælfgifu was also a benefactor of Shaftesbury Abbey; when she died in 944 she was buried there and venerated as a saint. Edmund had no known children by his second wife, Æthelflæd, who died after 991. Her father Ælfgar became ealdorman of Essex in 946. Edmund presented him with a sword lavishly decorated with gold and silver, which Ælfgar later presented to King Eadred. Æthelflæd&#x27;s second husband was Æthelstan Rota, a south-east Mercian ealdorman, and her will survives.

== Death and succession ==
On 26 May 946, Edmund was killed in a brawl at Pucklechurch in Gloucestershire. According to the post-Conquest chronicler, John of Worcester:

The historians Clare Downham and Kevin Halloran dismiss John of Worcester&#x27;s account and suggest that the king was the victim of a political assassination, but this view has not been accepted by other historians.

Like his son Edgar thirty years later, Edmund was buried at Glastonbury Abbey. The location may have reflected its spiritual prestige and royal endorsement of the monastic reform movement, but as his death was unexpected it is more likely that Dunstan was successful in claiming the body. His sons were still young children, so he was succeeded as king by his brother Eadred, who was in turn succeeded by Edmund&#x27;s elder son Eadwig in 955.

== Assessment ==
Historians&#x27; views of Edmund&#x27;s character and record differ widely. The historian Barbara Yorke comments that when substantial powers were delegated there was a danger that subjects would become over-powerful: the kings following Æthelstan came to the throne young and had short reigns, and the families of Æthelstan &#x27;Half-King&#x27; and Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia, developed unassailable positions. In the view of Cyril Hart: &quot;For the whole of his brief reign, the young king Edmund remained strongly under the influence of his mother Eadgifu and the &quot;Half King&quot;, who between them must have decided much of the national policy.&quot; In contrast, Williams describes Edmund as &quot;an energetic and forceful ruler&quot; and Stenton commented that &quot;he proved himself to be both warlike and politically effective&quot;, while in Dumville&#x27;s view, but for his early death &quot;he might yet have been remembered as one of the more remarkable of Anglo-Saxon kings&quot;.

The historian Ryan Lavelle comments that &quot;a case can be made, as Alaric Trousdale has recently done [in his PhD thesis on Edmund&#x27;s reign], for assigning Edmund a central role to the achievements of the tenth century English state&quot;. Trousdale comments that the period between the reigns of Æthelstan and Edgar has been comparatively neglected by historians: the reigns of Edmund, Eadred and Eadwig &quot;are often lumped together as a sort of interim period between the much more interesting reigns of Æthelstan and Edgar&quot;. He argues that &quot;King Edmund&#x27;s legislation shows an ambition towards tighter control of the localities through increased cooperation between all levels of government, and that king and archbishop were working closely together in restructuring the English administrative framework&quot;. Trousdale sees a transition which &quot;was marked in part by a small yet significant shift away from a reliance on traditional West Saxon administrative structures and the power blocs that had enjoyed influence under King Æthelstan, towards increased cooperation with interests and families from Mercia and East Anglia&quot;. He also sees Edmund as moving away from Æthelstan&#x27;s centralisation of power to a more collegial relationship with local secular and ecclesiastical authorities. Trousdale&#x27;s picture contrasts with that of other historians such as Sarah Foot, who emphasises the achievements of Æthelstan, and George Molyneaux in his study of the formation of the late Anglo-Saxon state in the reign of Edgar.

<doc id="10356" wikidata="Q12571883" url="?curid=10356" title="Endothermic process">
<text>An endothermic process is a chemical or physical process that absorbs heat from its surroundings. In terms of thermodynamics, it is a thermodynamic process with an increase in the enthalpy (or internal energy ) of the system. In an endothermic process, the heat that a system absorbs is thermal energy transfer into the system. Thus, an endothermic reaction generally leads to an increase in the temperature of the system and a decrease in that of the surroundings.

The term was coined by 19th-century French chemist Marcellin Berthelot. The term &quot;endothermic&quot; comes from the Greek ἔνδον (&quot;endon&quot;) meaning &#x27;within&#x27; and θερμ- (&quot;therm&quot;) meaning &#x27;hot&#x27; or &#x27;warm&#x27;.

An endothermic process may be a chemical process, such as dissolving ammonium nitrate () in water (), or a physical process, such as the melting of ice cubes.

The opposite of an endothermic process is an exothermic process, one that releases or &quot;gives out&quot; energy, usually in the form of heat and sometimes as electrical energy. Thus, &quot;endo&quot; in endothermic refers to energy or heat going in, and &quot;exo&quot; in exothermic refers to energy or heat going out. In each term (endothermic and exothermic) the prefix refers to where heat (or electrical energy) goes as the process occurs.

==In chemistry==

Due to bonds breaking and forming during various processes (changes in state, chemical reactions), there is usually a change in energy. If the energy of the forming bonds is greater than the energy of the breaking bonds, then energy is released. This is known as an exothermic reaction. However, if more energy is needed to break the bonds than the energy being released, energy is taken up. Therefore, it is an endothermic reaction.

==Details==
Whether a process can occur spontaneously depends not only on the enthalpy change but also on the entropy change () and absolute temperature . If a process is a spontaneous process at a certain temperature, the products have a lower Gibbs free energy than the reactants (an exergonic process), even if the enthalpy of the products is higher. Thus, an endothermic process usually requires a favorable entropy increase () in the system that overcomes the unfavorable increase in enthalpy so that still . While endothermic phase transitions into more disordered states of higher entropy, e.g. melting and vaporization, are common, spontaneous chemical processes at moderate temperatures are rarely endothermic. The enthalpy increase in a hypothetical strongly endothermic process usually results in , which means that the process will not occur (unless driven by electrical or photon energy). An example of an endothermic and exergonic process is

:&lt;chem&gt;C6H12O6 + 6 H2O -&gt; 12 H2 + 6 CO2&lt;/chem&gt;
:formula_1.

==Examples==
* Evaporation
* Sublimation
* Cracking of alkanes
* Thermal decomposition
* Hydrolysis
* Nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than nickel in stellar cores
* High-energy neutrons can produce tritium from lithium-7 in an endothermic process, consuming 2.466 MeV. This was discovered when the 1954 Castle Bravo nuclear test produced an unexpectedly high yield.
* Nuclear fusion of elements heavier than iron in supernovae
* Dissolving together barium hydroxide and ammonium chloride

==Distinction between endothermic and endotherm==
The terms &quot;endothermic&quot; and &quot;endotherm&quot; are both derived from Greek &#x27; &quot;within&quot; and &#x27; &quot;heat&quot;, but depending on context, they can have very different meanings.

In physics, thermodynamics applies to processes involving a system and its surroundings, and the term &quot;endothermic&quot; is used to describe a reaction where energy is taken &quot;(with)in&quot; by the system (vs. an &quot;exothermic&quot; reaction, which releases energy &quot;outwards&quot;).

In biology, thermoregulation is the ability of an organism to maintain its body temperature, and the term &quot;endotherm&quot; refers to an organism that can do so from &quot;within&quot; by using the heat released by its internal bodily functions (vs. an &quot;ectotherm&quot;, which relies on external, environmental heat sources) to maintain an adequate temperature.

<text>Sir Earle Christmas Grafton Page (8 August 188020 December 1961) was an Australian politician and surgeon who served as the 11th prime minister of Australia from 7 to 26 April 1939, in a caretaker capacity following the death of Joseph Lyons. He was the leader of the Country Party from 1921 to 1939, and was the most influential figure in its later years.

Page was born in Grafton, New South Wales. He entered the University of Sydney at the age of 15, and completed a degree in medicine at the age of 21. After completing his medical residency at Sydney&#x27;s Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, he moved back to Grafton and opened a private hospital. He soon became involved in local politics, and in 1915 purchased a part-share in &quot;The Daily Examiner&quot;, a local newspaper. He also briefly was a military surgeon during World War I. Page gained prominence as an advocate of various development schemes for the Northern Rivers region, especially those involving hydroelectricity. He also helped found a movement for New England statehood.

In 1919, Page was elected to Federal Parliament representing the Division of Cowper. He joined the new Country Party the following year as its inaugural whip, and then replaced William McWilliams as party leader in 1921. Page opposed the economic policies of Prime Minister Billy Hughes, and when the Country Party gained the balance of power at the 1922 election, he demanded Hughes&#x27; resignation as the price for a coalition with the Nationalist Party. He was subsequently made Treasurer of Australia under the new prime minister, Stanley Bruce, serving in that role from 1923 to 1929. He had a significant degree of influence on domestic policy, with Bruce concentrating on international issues.

Page returned to cabinet after the 1934 election, when the Country Party entered a new coalition with Joseph Lyons&#x27; United Australia Party (UAP). He was appointed Minister for Commerce, and concentrated on agricultural issues. When Lyons died in office in April 1939, Page was commissioned as his successor in a caretaker capacity while the UAP elected a new leader, Robert Menzies. Page subsequently denounced Menzies and refused to serve in his cabinet, withdrawing the Country Party from the coalition, but this proved unpopular and he resigned the party leadership after a few months. The coalition was eventually reconstituted, and Page served again as Minister for Commerce under Menzies and Arthur Fadden until the government&#x27;s defeat in October 1941.

Page&#x27;s last major role was as Minister for Health (1949–1956) in the post-war Menzies Government. He retired from cabinet at the age of 76, and died a short time after losing his seat at the 1961 election. Page served in parliament for almost 42 years, the third longest-serving Australian parliamentarian of all time; only Menzies lasted longer as the leader of a major Australian political party. He secured his party&#x27;s independence by refusing overtures to merge with the Nationalists and the UAP, and the policies that he favoured – decentralisation, agrarianism, and government support of primary industry – have remained the basis of its platform up to the present day. The coalitions that he established and maintained with Bruce and Lyons have served as a model for all subsequent coalition governments.

==Early life==
===Birth and family background===
Earle Christmas Grafton Page was born in Grafton, New South Wales, on 8 August 1880. His first middle name, which he disliked, was given to him to carry on the surname of a childless relative, while his second middle name was in honour of his birthplace. Page was the fifth of eleven children born to Charles Page and Mary Johanna Haddon (Annie) Cox. His older brother Rodger was chaplain to the royal family of Tonga and his younger brother Harold was the deputy administrator of the Territory of New Guinea and a Japanese prisoner of war. Page&#x27;s parents had both lived in Grafton since they were children. His mother was born in Tasmania to an English father and a Scottish mother. His father, born in London, was a successful businessman and a member of the Grafton City Council, serving a single term as mayor in 1908. The family business was a hardware manufacturing firm, which had its origins in a coachbuilding firm established in 1858 by Page&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Edwin Cox. His other grandfather, James Page, arrived in Grafton in 1855, serving as the town&#x27;s first schoolmaster and first town clerk.

===Education===
Page began his schooling at Grafton Public School, where he excelled academically. His family could not afford to send him to boarding school, as a result of financial difficulties caused by the banking crisis of 1893. Page consequently had to rely on scholarships to advance his education. He won a bursary to attend Sydney Boys High School in 1895, where he passed the university entrance exams, and the following year – aged 15 – began studying a liberal arts course at the University of Sydney. He was equal top in mathematics in his first year, and was also awarded the lucrative Struth Exhibition for &quot;general proficiency in the arts&quot;, which allowed him to switch to medicine and covered his first four years of medical school. His role model was Grafton Smith, who had followed a similar path from Grafton Public School to university. At Sydney Medical School, Page&#x27;s lecturers included William Haswell (biology), James Hill (biology), Charles Martin (physiology), Anderson Stuart (physiology), and James Wilson (anatomy). He graduated at the top of his class in 1901, with the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine (M.B.) and Master of Surgery (Ch.M.).

==Medical career==
Page&#x27;s first professional posting came before he had even been registered as a medical practitioner. Due to a shortage of doctors, he was acting superintendent of the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children for one month. In 1902, he took up a position as a resident at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, serving in a variety of roles including as house surgeon under Robert Scot Skirving. During that time he contracted a near-fatal infection from a postmortem examination. He also met his future wife, nurse Ethel Blunt. Page returned to his home town in 1903, taking over a practice in South Grafton. He and two partners subsequently established a new private hospital, Clarence House Hospital, which opened in 1904 and served both Grafton and the surrounding region.

Page was a keen adopter of new technologies. In 1904, he bought what he claimed was &quot;the first Rover car in Australia&quot;, which was powered by kerosene. He upgraded to an Itala in 1908, and had the chassis enlarged so it could be used as an ambulance. He also had an x-ray machine installed in his hospital, one of the first in Australia outside a major city. Page developed a reputation for surgical innovation, taking a number of patients from Sydney and even some from interstate. One operation that brought him particular fame was the removal of a patient&#x27;s diseased lung, a procedure that had only been invented a few years previously. Page became an inaugural Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (FRACS) in 1927, and in 1942 was made an honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (FRCS).

In February 1916, Page enlisted in the Australian Army Medical Corps. He was chief medical officer aboard the troopship &quot;Ballarat&quot;, and was then stationed at an army hospital in Cairo for several months. He was transferred to a hospital in England in July 1916, and concluded his service as a surgical specialist at a casualty clearing station in France. Page returned to Australia in March 1917 and was discharged from the military in July 1917. Although his active involvement in medicine declined as his political career progressed, he was frequently called upon to treat his fellow MPs or parliamentary staff. This was particularly true after the federal government moved to Canberra, as the new capital had only a handful of qualified surgeons. In 1928, for instance, he performed an emergency appendectomy on Parker Moloney.

==Early political involvement==

Page&#x27;s medical career brought him considerable wealth, and he began investing in land. He bought several large farming properties in South-East Queensland, including in Nerang, Kandanga, and the Numinbah Valley; Pages Pinnacle in the Numinbah State Forest is named after him. His entry into public life came about as a result of his passion for hydroelectricity, which he first observed in New Zealand while attending a medical convention in 1910. He believed that it could be applied to the Northern Rivers region, which was still mostly unelectrified outside of the major towns. Page was elected to the South Grafton Municipal Council in 1913, believing his position as an alderman would be useful in his lobbying efforts. However, his overtures to the state government were rebuffed. In 1915, Page was one of the founders of the Northern New South Wales Separation League, which advocated the creation of a new state in the New England region. He toured a number of towns to raise awareness of the new movement, but interest waned as a result of the ongoing war. Later that year, he was part of a syndicate that bought &quot;The Daily Examiner&quot;, the local newspaper in Grafton.

Page visited a number of hydroelectric sites in North America in 1917, on his way back from military service in France. He was elected mayor of South Grafton in 1918, serving until 1920, and also became the inaugural president of the North Coast Development League. He developed more concrete plans for a hydroelectric project on the Clarence River, and put forward various other development schemes relating to roads, railways, and ports, all of which served to raise his profile in the local district. Page was elected to the Australian House of Representatives at the 1919 federal election, defeating the sitting Nationalist MP, John Thomson in the Division of Cowper. He stood as an independent with the endorsement of the Farmers&#x27; and Settlers&#x27; Association, and after the election joined the new Country Party, along with 10 other MPs from rural seats. Page continued to advocate for hydroelectricity throughout his political career, and many such projects were built in New South Wales. However, the specific scheme he favoured for the Clarence River was never put in place, only the smaller Nymboida Power Station. Decentralisation also remained a pet project, with Page frequently arguing for New South Wales and Queensland to be divided into smaller states to aid regional development. The movement for New England statehood waned in the 1920s, but re-emerged in the 1950s; a legally binding referendum on the subject was finally held in 1967, after Page&#x27;s death, but was narrowly defeated in controversial circumstances.

==Bruce–Page government==
===Government formation===
Page was elected leader of the Country Party in 1921, replacing William McWilliams. At the 1922 federal election the party campaigned on a platform which included the establishment of a national sinking fund, national insurance scheme covering &quot;sickness, unemployment, poverty and age&quot;, and conversion of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia into a full central bank. The party emerged from the election with the balance of power in the House; the Nationalist government of Billy Hughes lost its majority and could not govern without Country Party support. It soon became apparent that the price for that support would be a full coalition with the Nationalists. However, the Country Party had been formed partly due to discontent with Hughes&#x27; rural policy, and Page&#x27;s animosity toward Hughes was such that he would not even consider supporting him. Indeed, he would not even begin talks with the Nationalists as long as Hughes remained leader. Bowing to the inevitable, Hughes resigned.

Page then began negotiations with Hughes&#x27; successor as leader of the Nationalists, Stanley Bruce. His terms were stiff; he wanted his Country Party to have five seats in an 11-man cabinet, including the post of Treasurer and the second rank in the ministry for himself. These demands were unprecedented for a prospective junior coalition partner in a Westminster system, and especially so for such a new party. Nonetheless, Bruce agreed rather than force another election. For all intents and purposes, Page was the first Deputy Prime Minister of Australia (a title that did not officially exist until 1968). Since then, the leader of the Country/National Party has been the second-ranking member in nearly every non-Labor government. Page was acting prime minister on several occasions, and in January 1924 chaired the first meeting of Federal Cabinet ever held in Canberra, at Yarralumla. Parliament did not move to Canberra until 1927.

===Treasurer===

As Treasurer, Page formed a close working relationship with Bruce. Due to favourable economic conditions the government was able to abolish land tax, cut income tax, and establishment the national sinking fund that Page had campaigned on. The government also established an investment fund for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and sponsored the first national housing program. The final years of Page&#x27;s treasurership were marked by the beginnings of an economic downturn. The budget went into deficit in 1927 and his 1929 budget speech referred to a &quot;temporary financial depression&quot;. He was a strong believer in orthodox finance and conservative policies, as well as a &quot;high protectionist&quot; supporting tariff barriers to protect Australian rural industries.

Page introduced a series of reforms to the Commonwealth Bank to enhance its central banking functions. In 1924, he announced that the government would place the Commonwealth Bank under an independent board, comprising a governor, the Treasury secretary, and representatives of industry. The same bill placed banknotes under the direct control of the bank, whereas previously it had been under a nominally independent Note Issue Board. Later reforms saw the establishment of a Rural Credits Department within the bank, the profits of which were partly hypothecated to agricultural research. In March 1925, cabinet decided to return Australia to the gold standard, which it had left during World War I. It delayed its announcement until the United Kingdom had decided it would do the same, which &quot;disguised what was arguably Australia’s first explicit macroeconomic policy decision&quot;.

In 1924, Bruce and Page established the Loan Council to coordinate public-sector borrowings between the state and federal governments. It was given constitutional force with an amendment passed in 1928. The government abolished the previous system of per-capita grants to states that had been implemented in 1911 and began introducing tied grants, initially for road building. It also established a royal commission into the proposed National Insurance scheme, chaired by Senator John Millen. Page was one of the chief supporters of the &quot;National Insurance Bill 1928&quot;, which would have provided &quot;sickness, old age, disability and maternity benefits&quot;, as well as payments to orphans and a limited form of child endowment. It was to be paid for by compulsory contributions from workers and co-contributions from employers. The government took the policy to the 1928 Australian federal election but failed to pass the bill by the time of its defeat in 1929.

As Treasurer, Page continued his professional medical practice. On 22 October 1924, he had to tell his best friend, Thomas Shorten Cole (1870–1957), the news that his wife Mary Ann Crane had just died on the operating table from complications of intestinal or stomach cancer, reputed by their daughter Dorothy May Cole to be &quot;the worst day of his life&quot;. Due to a shortage of surgeons in Canberra, in 1928 Page performed an appendectomy on fellow MP Parker Moloney.

==Out of office, 1929–1934==
In his memoirs, Page recalled that the defeat of the government at the 1929 election came as a relief, following the intense stress of the government&#x27;s final term. He and the Country Party sat on the crossbench, with John Latham replacing Bruce as Nationalist leader and leader of the opposition. Page regarded time out of office as a period which &quot;sharpened our wits and enabled us to prepare public opinion for the policies we hoped to implement when the next opportunity came&quot;.

In 1931, a group of dissident Labor MPs led by former Scullin government minister Joseph Lyons merged with the Nationalists to form the United Australia Party (UAP), with Lyons replacing Latham as opposition leader. Page and Lyons produced a joint policy statement in October 1931 and Page expected that the Country Party would form a new coalition government. However, at the 1931 election the UAP won majority government in its own right. Lyons offered the Country Party three cabinet positions, on the basis that he would choose the ministers and portfolios. Page rejected this and also insisted that the trade and customs portfolio be assigned to the Country Party. Negotiations eventually collapsed and Lyons formed a UAP-only ministry.

Page&#x27;s oldest son Earle Jr. was killed by a lightning strike in January 1933; shortly after his wife Ethel suffered a stroke. Page considered retiring from politics but was persuaded to instead take a leave of absence, with his deputy Thomas Paterson serving as acting leader of the Country Party for nine months.

==Lyons government, 1934–1939==
The UAP lost its majority at the 1934 election, after which Lyons governed in minority for two months. He eventually negotiated a new coalition agreement with Page, which provided four ministerial positions and assurances around tariff policies. Page was appointed Minister for Commerce, a significant portfolio covering agriculture and trade policy, and again became the &quot;de facto&quot; deputy prime minister.

One of Page&#x27;s first initiatives in the commerce portfolio was the creation of the Australian Agricultural Council (AAC) in December 1934, which aimed to coordinate state and federal agricultural policy on a similar basis to the Loan Council. In his 1934 election policy he had envisioned the AAC as a &quot;board of directors for Australian agriculture&quot; that would &quot;eliminate needless waste of public and private capital&quot;. The council &quot;quickly became central to agricultural policy&quot;, covering a wide variety of topics including debt relief for farmers, agricultural marketing (reforms to which were rejected in a 1937 referendum), soil erosion, pest control, and problems in the wheat and dairy industries. Page found some of his attempts to guide policy were stymied by state agricultural ministers, with the AAC remaining a voluntary body reliant on passage of state legislation.

Page was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in the New Year&#x27;s Day Honours of 1938. While nine Australian prime ministers were knighted (and Bruce was elevated to the peerage), Page is the only one who was knighted before becoming prime minister.

==Prime Minister and aftermath==
When Lyons died suddenly in 1939, the Governor-General of Australia Lord Gowrie appointed Page as caretaker prime minister pending the UAP choosing a new leader. He held the office for three weeks until the UAP elected former deputy leader Robert Menzies as its new leader, and hence prime minister. Page had been close to Lyons, but disliked Menzies, whom he charged publicly with having been disloyal to Lyons. Page contacted Stanley Bruce (now in London as Australian High Commissioner to the UK) and offered to resign his seat if Bruce would return to Australia to seek re-election to the parliament in a by-election for Page&#x27;s old seat, and then seek election as UAP leader. Bruce said that he would only re-enter the parliament as an independent.

When Menzies was elected UAP leader, Page refused to serve under him, and made an extraordinary personal attack on him in the House, accusing him not only of ministerial incompetence but of physical cowardice (for failing to enlist during World War I). His party soon rebelled, though, and Page was deposed as Country Party leader in favour of Archie Cameron.

==World War II==
In March 1940, Archie Cameron led the Country Party back into coalition with the UAP. However, he resigned as party leader on 16 October, following the 1940 federal election. Page attempted to regain the party&#x27;s leadership, but was deadlocked with John McEwen over multiple ballots. As a compromise, the party elected Arthur Fadden as acting leader; he was confirmed in the position a few months later. Page replaced Cameron as Minister for Commerce in the reconstituted ministry.
Fadden replaced Menzies as prime minister in August 1941. A few weeks later, cabinet decided to send Page to London as resident minister, with the intention that he would be granted access to the British War Cabinet. While he was en route to England, the Fadden government lost a confidence motion and was replaced by an ALP minority government. The new prime minister John Curtin nonetheless allowed Page to take up the position, declining his offer to return to Australia. The attack on Pearl Harbor in December changed the dynamic of Anglo-Australian relations, as the War in the Pacific became the primary concern of the Australian government. Page assisted in the creation of the Pacific War Council early the following year. He later recalled Winston Churchill&#x27;s frustration in war cabinet meetings with Curtin&#x27;s decision to withdraw troops from the Middle East and North Africa and return them to Australia. He credited himself with helping negate the tensions between the two men, but in February 1942 mistakenly advised Churchill that the Australian government was amenable to diverting the 7th Division to Burma rather than return it directly to Australia. He was heavily rebuked by Curtin and external affairs minister H. V. Evatt for his error.

Page wrote to Curtin in April 1942 that since January he had been through &quot;the worst period of acute mental distress of my whole life&quot;. His tenure was not regarded as a success, and he was said to have suffered from a lack of experience in diplomacy. Field Marshal Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, recalled that in war cabinet meetings he had &quot;the mentality of a greengrocer&quot;. Page left London in June 1942 following a severe bout of pneumonia. He had been made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) before his departure. He returned to Australia in August, travelling via the United States, and quickly turned his attention to planning for post-war reconstruction.

Page spent the remaining years of the Curtin and Chifley governments on the opposition backbench. He served on the Advisory War Council and was a delegate to the constitutional convention in Canberra in late 1942, which included members of all major political parties. However, he was frustrated by the government&#x27;s failure to offer him any formal role in developing post-war policy, which he believed was due to him given his past work. Page&#x27;s brother Harold and nephew Robert were killed by the Japanese during the war.

==Return to the ministry==

Page was reappointed Minister for Health after the Coalition won the 1949 federal election, at the age of 69. He was the chief architect of the &quot;National Health Act 1953&quot;, which established a national public health scheme based on government subsidies of voluntary private insurance and free medical services for pensioners. He played a key role in securing the support of the medical profession, which had strongly opposed the Chifley government&#x27;s attempt to introduce universal health care. Unlike in previous governments, Page had little influence beyond his own policy area and was frustrated by the lack of interest in his ideas for national development. In 1951 when Senator Gordon Brown of the ALP suffered a stroke while speaking in the Senate, Page, a trained surgeon rushed in from the House to treat him before medical professionals could take Brown to hospital for treatment.

Upon the death of Billy Hughes in October 1952, Page became the Father of the House of Representatives and Father of the Parliament. In 1954, he became the first chancellor of the University of New England, which had become fully autonomous from the University of Sydney. He retired from cabinet at the age of 76, moving to the backbench in January 1956 after the December 1955 election.

Upon Arthur Fadden&#x27;s retirement in 1958, Page became the only former prime minister returned at that year&#x27;s election.

==Electoral history==
==Later life and death==
Page sought a 17th term in parliament at the 1961 election, having joined Billy Hughes two years earlier as only the second person to serve over 40 years in federal parliament. Two weeks before the election, he experienced stomach pains while visiting the home of Ian Robinson near Coraki, New South Wales. His health then dramatically declined and he was admitted to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. He was diagnosed with bowel cancer and underwent immediate surgery. He had been gravely ill even before being admitted to hospital and was too sick to campaign nearly as actively as he had campaigned in the previous four decades. He fought the election anyway, though he scarcely appeared on the hustings.

Page died in hospital on 20 December 1961, aged 81. He was granted a state funeral at St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney. At his request, his ashes were scattered over the Clarence River near his home. On the same date Page died, the election result in Cowper was declared and recorded his defeat by Labor challenger Frank McGuren, as part of a nationwide swing against the Coalition. The seat had been reported as a Labor gain on election night 11 days earlier; Page died without knowing he had been defeated.

Page had represented Cowper for just four days short of 42 years, making him the longest-serving Australian federal parliamentarian who represented the same seat throughout his career. Only Billy Hughes and Philip Ruddock have served in Parliament longer than Page. He was the last former prime minister to lose his seat until Tony Abbott lost his seat of Warringah in 2019, though John Howard would lose his seat of Bennelong as a sitting prime minister in 2007.

Page&#x27;s defeat/death saw the Australian Federal Parliament having no former prime ministers among its members for the first time since the period between Sir Joseph Cook&#x27;s resignation from Parliament in 1921 to become Australia&#x27;s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Page forcing Billy Hughes&#x27; resignation as prime minister in 1923.

== Personal life ==

Page married Ethel Blunt on 18 September 1906. They had met at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital while he was undertaking his medical residency; she was a senior nurse there. Page soon began courting her, and convinced her to become the matron of his new hospital in Grafton. She gave up nursing after their marriage, but was active in politics and community organisations. The couple had five children: Mary (b. 1909), Earle Jr. (b. 1910), Donald (b. 1912), Iven (b. 1914), and Douglas (b. 1916). Their grandchildren include Don Page, who was active in New South Wales state politics, and Geoff Page, a poet.

Page was predeceased by his first wife and his oldest son. Earle Jr., a qualified veterinarian, was killed by a lightning strike in January 1933, aged 22. Ethel died in May 1958, aged 82, after a long illness. On 20 July 1959 at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, Page married for a second time, wedding his long-serving secretary Jean Thomas (32 years his junior). Stanley Bruce was his best man. The second Lady Page lived for almost 50 years after her husband&#x27;s death, dying on 20 June 2011; her ashes were interred at Northern Suburbs Crematorium.

<text>Ephrem the Syrian (; ), also known as Saint Ephrem, Saint Ephraim (), Ephrem of Edessa or Aprem of Nisibis, was a prominent Christian theologian and writer who is revered as one of the most notable hymnographers of Eastern Christianity. He was born in Nisibis, served as a deacon and later lived in Edessa.

Ephrem is venerated as a saint by all traditional Churches. He is especially revered in Syriac Christianity, both in East Syriac tradition and West Syriac tradition, and also counted as a Holy and Venerable Father (i.e., a sainted monk) in the Eastern Orthodox Church, especially in the Slovak tradition. He was declared a Doctor of the Church in the Roman Catholic Church in 1920. Ephrem is also credited as the founder of the School of Nisibis, which, in later centuries, was the centre of learning of the Church of the East.

Ephrem wrote a wide variety of hymns, poems, and sermons in verse, as well as prose exegesis. These were works of practical theology for the edification of the Church in troubled times. Some of these works have been examined by feminist scholars who have analyzed the incorporation of feminine imagery in his texts. They also examine the performance practice of all-women choirs singing his madrāšê, or his teaching hymns. Ephrem&#x27;s works were so popular that, for centuries after his death, Christian authors wrote hundreds of pseudepigraphal works in his name. He has been called the most significant of all of the fathers of the Syriac-speaking church tradition. In Syriac Christian tradition, he is considered patron of the Syriac Aramaic people.

==Life==
Ephrem was born around the year 306 in the city of Nisibis (modern Nusaybin, Turkey), in the Roman province of Mesopotamia, that was recently acquired by the Roman Empire. Internal evidence from Ephrem&#x27;s hymnody suggests that both his parents were part of the growing Christian community in the city, although later hagiographers wrote that his father was a pagan priest. In those days, religious culture in the region of Nisibis included local polytheism, Judaism and several varieties of the Early Christianity. Most of the population spoke the Aramaic language, while Greek and Latin were languages of administration. The city had a complex ethnic composition, consisting of &quot;Assyrians, Arabs, Greeks, Jews, Parthians, Romans, and Iranians&quot;.
Jacob, the second bishop of Nisibis, was appointed in 308, and Ephrem grew up under his leadership of the community. Jacob of Nisibis is recorded as a signatory at the First Council of Nicea in 325. Ephrem was baptized as a youth and almost certainly became a son of the covenant, an unusual form of Syriac proto-monasticism. Jacob appointed Ephrem as a teacher (Syriac &quot;malp̄ānâ&quot;, a title that still carries great respect for Syriac Christians). He was ordained as a deacon either at his baptism or later. He began to compose hymns and write biblical commentaries as part of his educational office. In his hymns, he sometimes refers to himself as a &quot;herdsman&quot; (, &quot;&#x27;allānâ&quot;), to his bishop as the &quot;shepherd&quot; (, &quot;rā&#x27;yâ&quot;), and to his community as a &#x27;fold&#x27; (, &quot;dayrâ&quot;). Ephrem is popularly credited as the founder of the School of Nisibis, which, in later centuries, was the centre of learning of the Church of the East.

In 337, Emperor Constantine I, who had legalised and promoted the practice of Christianity in the Roman Empire, died. Seizing on this opportunity, Shapur II of Persia began a series of attacks into Roman North Mesopotamia. Nisibis was besieged in 338, 346 and 350. During the first siege, Ephrem credits Bishop Jacob as defending the city with his prayers. In the third siege, of 350, Shapur rerouted the River Mygdonius to undermine the walls of Nisibis. The Nisibenes quickly repaired the walls while the Persian elephant cavalry became bogged down in the wet ground. Ephrem celebrated what he saw as the miraculous salvation of the city in a hymn that portrayed Nisibis as being like Noah&#x27;s Ark, floating to safety on the flood.

One important physical link to Ephrem&#x27;s lifetime is the baptistery of Nisibis. The inscription tells that it was constructed under Bishop Vologeses in 359. In that year, Shapur attacked again. The cities around Nisibis were destroyed one by one, and their citizens killed or deported. Constantius II was unable to respond; the campaign of Julian in 363 ended with his death in battle. His army elected Jovian as the new emperor, and to rescue his army, he was forced to surrender Nisibis to Persia (also in 363) and to permit the expulsion of the entire Christian population. Ephrem declined being ordained a bishop by feigning madness, because he regarded himself unworthy for it.

Ephrem, with the others, went first to Amida (Diyarbakır), eventually settling in Edessa (Urhay, in Aramaic) in 363. Ephrem, in his late fifties, applied himself to ministry in his new church and seems to have continued his work as a teacher, perhaps in the School of Edessa. Edessa had been an important center of the Aramaic-speaking world, and the birthplace of a specific Middle Aramaic dialect that came to be known as the Syriac language. The city was rich with rivaling philosophies and religions. Ephrem comments that orthodox Nicene Christians were simply called &quot;Palutians&quot; in Edessa, after a former bishop. Arians, Marcionites, Manichees, Bardaisanites and various gnostic sects proclaimed themselves as the true church. In this confusion, Ephrem wrote a great number of hymns defending Nicene orthodoxy. A later Syriac writer, Jacob of Serugh, wrote that Ephrem rehearsed all-female choirs to sing his hymns set to Syriac folk tunes in the forum of Edessa. In 370 he visited Basil the Great at Caesarea, and then journeyed to the monks of Egypt. As he preached a panegyric on St. Basil, who died in 379, his own death must be placed at a later date. After a ten-year residency in Edessa, in his sixties, Ephrem succumbed to the plague as he ministered to its victims. He died in 373.

==Language==
Ephrem wrote exclusively in his native Aramaic language, using the local Edessan (&quot;Urhaya&quot;) dialect, that later came to be known as the Classical Syriac. Ephrem&#x27;s works contain several endonymic (native) references to his language (&quot;Aramaic&quot;), homeland (&quot;Aram&quot;) and people (&quot;Arameans&quot;). He is therefore known as &quot;the authentic voice of Aramaic Christianity&quot;.

In the early stages of modern scholarly studies, it was believed that some examples of the long-standing Greek practice of labeling Aramaic as &quot;Syriac&quot;, that are found in the &quot;Cave of Treasures&quot;, can be attributed to Ephrem, but later scholarly analyses have shown that the work in question was written much later ( 600) by an unknown author, thus also showing that Ephrem&#x27;s original works still belonged to the tradition unaffected by exonymic (foreign) labeling.

One of the early admirers of Ephrem&#x27;s works, theologian Jacob of Serugh (d. 521), who already belonged to the generation that accepted the custom of a double naming of their language not only as Aramaic (&quot;Ārāmāyā&quot;) but also as &quot;Syriac&quot; (&quot;Suryāyā&quot;), wrote a homily (&quot;memrā&quot;) dedicated to Ephrem, praising him as the &quot;crown&quot; or &quot;wreath&quot; of the &quot;Arameans&quot; (), and the same praise was repeated in early liturgical texts. Only later, under the Greek influence already prevalent in the works of the middle fifth century author Theodoret of Cyrus, did it became customary to associate Ephrem with Syriac identity, and label him only as &quot;the Syrian&quot; (), thus blurring his Aramaic self-identification, attested by his own writings and works of other Aramaic-speaking writers, and also by examples from the earliest liturgical tradition.

Some of those problems persisted up to the recent times, even in scholarly literature, as a consequence of several methodological problems within the field of source editing. During the process of critical editing and translation of sources within Syriac studies, some scholars have practiced various forms of arbitrary (and often unexplained) interventions, including the occasional disregard for the importance of original terms, used as endonymic (native) designations for Arameans and their language (ārāmāyā). Such disregard was manifested primarily in translations and commentaries, by replacement of authentic terms with polysemic Syrian/Syriac labels. In previously mentioned &quot;memrā&quot;, dedicated to Ephrem, one of the terms for &quot;Aramean people&quot; ( / Arameandom) was published correctly in original script of the source, but in the same time it was translated in English as &quot;Syriac nation&quot;&quot;,&quot; and then enlisted among quotations related to &quot;Syrian/Syriac&quot; identity, without any mention of Aramean-related terms in the source. Even when noticed and corrected by some scholars, such replacements of terms continue to create problems for others.

Several translations of his writings exist in Classical Armenian, Coptic, Old Georgian, Koine Greek and other languages. Some of his works are extant only in translation (particularly in Armenian).

== Writings and authorship ==

=== Manuscripts ===
According to the Catalogues of Syriac Manuscripts in the British Library published by Forshall &amp; Rosen (1839) and Wright (1870–72), there are &quot;ninety or so manuscripts which contain works by or attributed to Ephraem.&quot;

=== Hymns ===
Over four hundred hymns attributed to Ephrem still exist. Granted that some have been lost, Ephrem&#x27;s productivity is not in doubt. The church historian Sozomen credits Ephrem with having written three million verses. Ephrem combines in his writing a threefold heritage: he draws on the models and methods of early Rabbinic Judaism, he engages skillfully with Greek science and philosophy, and he delights in the Mesopotamian/Persian tradition of mystery symbolism.

The most important of his works are his lyric, teaching hymns (ܡܕܖ̈ܫܐ, &quot;madrāšê&quot;). These hymns are full of rich, poetic imagery drawn from biblical sources, folk tradition, and other religions and philosophies. The &quot;madrāšê&quot; are written in stanzas of syllabic verse and employ over fifty different metrical schemes. The form is defined by an antiphon, or congregational refrain (ܥܘܢܝܬܐ, &quot;&#x27;ûnîṯâ&quot;), between each independent strophe (or verse), and the refrain&#x27;s melody mimics that of the opening half of the strophe. Each &quot;madrāšâ&quot; had its &quot;qālâ&quot; (ܩܠܐ), a traditional tune identified by its opening line. All of these &quot;qālê&quot; are now lost. It seems that Bardaisan and Mani composed &quot;madrāšê&quot;, and Ephrem felt that the medium was a suitable tool to use against their claims.

The &quot;madrāšê&quot; are gathered into various hymn cycles. In the CSCO critical edition of Beck et al. (1955–1975), these have been given standardised names and abbreviations. By the year 2000, English translations had been published for the following:
* 52 hymns &quot;On Virginity&quot;
* 28 hymns &quot;On the Nativity&quot;
* 15 hymns &quot;On Paradise&quot;
* 4 hymns &quot;Against [Emperor Caesar] Julian&quot;
* &quot;Carmina Nisibena&quot; or &quot;On Nisibis&quot;
* &quot;On the Church&quot;
* &quot;On Lent&quot;
* &quot;On the Paschal Season&quot;
* &quot;Against Heresies&quot;
Some of these titles do not do justice to the entirety of the collection (for instance, only the first half of the &quot;Carmina Nisibena&quot; is about Nisibis). Bates (2000) remarked: &quot;[Various] collections of Ephrem&#x27;s hymns [...] appear to be randomly assembled by later editors and named for the subject of the first hymn in the collection only&quot;.

Particularly influential were his &quot;Hymns Against Heresies&quot;. Ephrem used these to warn his flock of the heresies that threatened to divide the early church. He lamented that the faithful were &quot;tossed to and fro and carried around with every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by their craftiness and deceitful wiles&quot; (Eph 4:14). He devised hymns laden with doctrinal details to inoculate right-thinking Christians against heresies such as docetism. The &quot;Hymns Against Heresies&quot; employ colourful metaphors to describe the Incarnation of Christ as fully human and divine. Ephrem asserts that Christ&#x27;s unity of humanity and divinity represents peace, perfection and salvation; in contrast, docetism and other heresies sought to divide or reduce Christ&#x27;s nature and, in doing so, rend and devalue Christ&#x27;s followers with their false teachings.

==== Authenticity of hymns &quot;On Epiphany&quot; ====
The most complete, critical text of writings attributed to Ephrem was compiled between 1955 and 1979 by Dom Edmund Beck, OSB, as part of the &quot;Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium&quot; (CSCO). Beck&#x27;s 1959 critical edition of the madrashe (hymns) and mêmrê (homilies) memre attributed to Ephrem led to much scholarly debate on the authenticity of the madrashe known as &quot;On Epiphany&quot;, as Ephrem was certainly not familiar with Epiphany as a feast celebrating Jesus&#x27; bapitism on 6 January. Unlike in Europe, where the Nativity of Jesus was celebrated on 25 December, but the baptism of Jesus would evolve into a separate feast called &quot;Epiphany&quot; on 6 January, there was only one Christian feast celebrated in winter in the time and place where Ephrem lived, namely the Nativity on 6 January, when baptism was also performed. A 1956 paper written by Beck himself therefore warned researchers not to base their reconstructions of Ephrem&#x27;s baptismal theology on the contents of these madrashe, given the fact that many of the hymns presuppose that Epiphany and Nativity were two separate feasts celebrated two weeks apart, thereby challenging Ephrem&#x27;s authorship. While the oldest surviving manuscripts of Ephrem&#x27;s hymns date to the 6th century and contain hymns on the Nativity that Beck thought were certainly authentic, the contested hymns &quot;On Epiphany&quot; are missing from them. They do not appear in manuscripts until much later, in the 9th century, suggesting that they were interpolated. Scholars have largely accepted Beck&#x27;s arguments that the collection as a whole was established after the 4th century, and that some hymns in them were not written by Ephrem, or at least not in the form that they have been preserved in, but that other hymns should nevertheless be considered authentic.

=== Performance practices and gender ===

The relationship between Ephrem&#x27;s compositions and femininity is shown again in documentation suggesting that the madrāšê were sung by all-women choirs with an accompanying lyre. These women&#x27;s choirs were composed of members of the Daughters of the Covenant, an important institution in historical Syriac Christianity, but they weren&#x27;t always labeled as such. Ephrem, like many Syriac liturgical poets, believed that women&#x27;s voices were important to hear in the church as they were modeled after Mary, mother of Jesus, whose acceptance of God&#x27;s call led to salvation for all through the birth of Jesus. One variety of the madrāšê, the &quot;soghyatha&quot;, was sung in a conversational style between male and female choirs. The women&#x27;s choir would sing the role of biblical women, and the men&#x27;s choir would sing the male role. Through the role of singing Ephrem&#x27;s madrāšê, women&#x27;s choirs were granted a role in worship.

=== Further writings ===
Ephrem also wrote verse homilies (, &quot;mêmrê&quot;). These sermons in poetry are far fewer in number than the madrāšê. The mêmrê were written in a heptosyllabic couplets (pairs of lines of seven syllables each).

The third category of Ephrem&#x27;s writings is his prose work. He wrote a biblical commentary on the Diatessaron (the single gospel harmony of the early Syriac church), the Syriac original of which was found in 1957. His &quot;Commentary on Genesis and Exodus&quot; is an exegesis of Genesis and Exodus. Some fragments exist in Armenian of his commentaries on the Acts of the Apostles and Pauline Epistles.

He also wrote refutations against Bardaisan, Mani, Marcion and others.

===Symbols and metaphors===
Ephrem&#x27;s writings contain a rich variety of symbols and metaphors. Christopher Buck gives a summary of analysis of a selection of six key scenarios (the way, robe of glory, sons and daughters of the Covenant, wedding feast, harrowing of hell, Noah&#x27;s Ark/Mariner) and six root metaphors (physician, medicine of life, mirror, pearl, Tree of life, paradise).

== Pseudepigraphy and misattributions ==
Ephrem&#x27;s meditations on the symbols of Christian faith and his stand against heresy made him a popular source of inspiration throughout the church. There is a huge corpus of Ephrem []pseudepigraphy]] and legendary hagiography in many languages. Some of these compositions are in verse, often mimicking Ephrem&#x27;s heptasyllabic couplets. Syriac churches still use many of Ephrem&#x27;s hymns as part of the annual cycle of worship. However, most of these liturgical hymns are edited and conflated versions of the originals. Another one of the works attributed to Ephrem was the &quot;Cave of Treasures&quot;, written in Syriac, but by a much later, unknown author, who lived at the end of the 6th and the beginning of the 7th century.

=== Greek Ephrem ===

There is a very large number of works by &quot;Ephrem&quot; extant in Greek. In the literature this material is often referred to as &quot;Greek Ephrem&quot;, or &quot;Ephraem Graecus&quot; (&quot;Ephrem the Greek&quot;, as opposed to the real Ephrem the Syrian), as if it was by a single author. This is not the case, but the term is used for convenience. Some texts are in fact Greek translations of genuine works by Ephrem, but most are not. Ephrem is attributed with writing hagiographies such as &quot;The Life of Saint Mary the Harlot&quot; (extant in Greek and Latin), though this credit is called into question. The best known of these writings is the &quot;Prayer of Saint Ephrem&quot;, which is recited at every service during Great Lent and other fasting periods in Eastern Christianity.

There has been very little critical examination of any of these works. They were edited uncritically by Assemani, and there is also a modern Greek edition by Phrantzolas. Amongst scholars, there is a broad consensus that the Greek corpus attributed to Ephrem is only &#x27;sporadically authentic&#x27;.

=== Latin Ephrem and other languages ===
There are also works by &quot;Ephrem&quot; in Latin, Slavonic and Arabic. &quot;Ephrem Latinus&quot; is the term given to Latin translations of &quot;Ephrem Graecus&quot;. None is by Ephrem the Syrian. &quot;Pseudo-Ephrem Latinus&quot; is the name given to Latin works under the name of Ephrem which are imitations of the style of Ephrem Latinus. One example is the &quot;Apocalypse of Pseudo-Ephraem&quot;, extant in one Latin and one Syriac version. Also attributed to Ephrem are the &quot;Parenesis&quot; or &quot;precepts&quot;, found in the 10th-century Rila fragments and the early 13th-century &quot;Kyiv Caves Patericon&quot;, translated into Old Church Slavonic.

==Veneration as a saint==

Soon after Ephrem&#x27;s death, legendary accounts of his life began to circulate. One of the earlier &quot;modifications&quot; is the statement that Ephrem&#x27;s father was a pagan priest of Abnil or Abizal. However, internal evidence from his authentic writings suggest that he was raised by Christian parents.

Ephrem is venerated as an example of monastic discipline in Eastern Christianity. In the Eastern Orthodox scheme of hagiography, Ephrem is counted as a Venerable Father (i.e., a sainted monk). His feast day is celebrated on 28 January and on the Saturday of the Venerable Fathers (Cheesefare Saturday), which is the Saturday before the beginning of Great Lent.

On 5 October 1920, Pope Benedict XV proclaimed Ephrem a Doctor of the Church (&quot;Doctor of the Syrians&quot;).

The most popular title for Ephrem is &quot;Harp of the Spirit&quot; (Syriac: , &quot;Kenārâ d-Rûḥâ&quot;). He is also referred to as the Deacon of Edessa, the Sun of the Syrians and a Pillar of the Church.

His Roman Catholic feast day of 9 June conforms to his date of death. For 48 years (1920–1969), it was on 18 June, and this date is still observed in the Extraordinary Form.

Ephrem is honored with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on June 10.

Ephrem is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 9 June.

<text>The Enhanced Chip Set (ECS) is the second generation of the Amiga computer&#x27;s chipset, offering minor improvements over the original chipset (OCS) design. ECS was introduced in 1990 with the launch of the Amiga 3000. Another version was developed around 1994 but was unreleased due to Commodore International filing for bankruptcy. Amigas produced from 1990 onwards featured a mix of OCS and ECS chips, such as later versions of the Amiga 500 and the Commodore CDTV. Other ECS models were the Amiga 500+ in 1991 and lastly the Amiga 600 in 1992.

== Features ==
The enhanced chip set had two new chips, the 8375 HR Agnus and 8373 HR Denise. The ECS Denise chip offers &quot;Productivity&quot; VGA output (640×480 non-interlaced) and &quot;SuperHiRes&quot; (1280×200 or 1280×256) display modes (also available in interlaced mode), which are however limited to only 4 bits on-screen colors. The &quot;Productivity&quot; output required a multi-sync monitor. It also allowed for a greyscale resolution of 1008 x 800 pixels with the A2024 monitor.

Some Amigas, such as the Amiga 500 and the Amiga 2000 came with the ECS version of the Agnus chip but the original chipset version (OCS) of the Denise chip. It is possible to upgrade one or both of them to obtain partial or full ECS functionality by replacing OCS chips with ECS versions. Not all OCS chipset computers were upgradable, some such as the Amiga 2000-A and the Amiga 1000 had different Agnus sockets.

ECS was followed by the third generation AGA chipset with the launch of the Amiga 4000 and Amiga 1200 in 1992.

<text>The European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) serves as the main mission control centre for the European Space Agency (ESA) and is located in Darmstadt, Germany. ESOC&#x27;s primary function is the operation of uncrewed spacecraft on behalf of ESA and the launch and early orbit phases (LEOP) of ESA and third-party missions. The Centre is also responsible for a range of operations-related activities within ESA and in cooperation with ESA&#x27;s industry and international partners, including ground systems engineering, software development, flight dynamics and navigation, development of mission control tools and techniques and space debris studies.

ESOC&#x27;s current major activities comprise operating planetary and solar missions, such as Mars Express and the Trace Gas Orbiter, astronomy &amp; fundamental physics missions, such as Gaia and XMM Newton, and Earth observation missions such as CryoSat2 and Swarm.

ESOC is responsible for developing, operating and maintaining ESA&#x27;s ESTRACK network of ground stations. Teams at the Centre are also involved in research and development related to advanced mission control concepts and Space Situational Awareness, and standardisation activities related to frequency management; mission operations; tracking, telemetry and telecommanding; and space debris.

==ESTRACK==

ESOC hosts the control centre for the Agency&#x27;s European Tracking ESTRACK station network. The core network comprises seven stations in seven countries: Kourou (French Guiana), Cebreros (Spain), Redu (Belgium), Santa Maria (Portugal), Kiruna (Sweden), Malargüe (Argentina) and New Norcia (Australia). Operators are on duty at ESOC 24 hours/day, year round, to conduct tracking passes, uploading telecommands and downloading telemetry and data.

==Activities==

In addition to &#x27;pure&#x27; mission operations, a number of other activities take place at the Centre, most of which are directly related to ESA&#x27;s broader space operations activities.

* Flight dynamics: A team is responsible for all orbital calculations and orbit determinations.
* Mission analysis: Selection and calculation of possible orbits and launch windows
* Software development: Mission control systems and spacecraft management tools
* ESA Navigation Support Office: Calculating and predicting GPS and Galileo satellite orbits
* Ground station engineering: Developing deep-space tracking technology
* Space debris: Coordinating ESA&#x27;s debris research, provision of conjunction warning services and cooperating with agencies worldwide
* Frequency management: Helping manage radio spectrum used by all satellite operators

==History==
The European Space Operations Centre was formally inaugurated in Darmstadt, Germany, on 8 September 1967 by the then-Minister of Research of the Federal Republic of Germany, Gerhard Stoltenberg. Its role was to provide satellite control for the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO), which is today known as its successor organisation, the European Space Agency (ESA).

The 90-person ESOC facility was, as it is today, located on the west side of Darmstadt; it employed the staff and resources previously allocated to the European Space Data Centre (ESDAC), which had been established in 1963 to conduct orbit calculations. These were augmented by mission control staff transferred from ESTEC to operate satellites and manage the ESTRACK tracking station network.

Within just eight months, ESOC, as part of ESRO, was already operating its first mission, ESRO-2B, a scientific research satellite and the first of many operated from ESOC for ESRO, and later ESA.

By July 2012, ESOC had operated over 56 missions spanning science, Earth observation, orbiting observatories, meteorology and space physics.

In 2024 ESA announced a new satellite control center at ESOC. Designed to support multiple launch operations at once and with power redundancy that will provide 99% uptime, the control center will be designed with the future in mind.

==Location and expansion==
ESOC is located on the west side of the city of Darmstadt, some from the main train station, at Robert-Bosch-Straße 5. In 2011, ESA announced the first phase of the ESOC II modernisation and expansion project valued at €60 million. The new construction will be located across Robert-Bosch-Straße, opposite the current centre.

==Employees==
At ESOC, ESA employs approximately 800, comprising some 250 permanent staff and about 550 contractors. Staff from ESOC are routinely dispatched to work at other ESA establishments, ESTRACK stations, the ATV Control Centre (Toulouse), the Columbus Control Centre (Oberpfaffenhofen) and at partner facilities in several countries.

<text>The European Space Agency (ESA) is a 23-member intergovernmental body devoted to space exploration. With its headquarters in Paris and a staff of around 2,547 people globally as of 2023, the ESA was founded in 1975 in the context of European integration. Its 2025 annual budget was €7.7 billion.

The ESA&#x27;s space flight programme includes human spaceflight (mainly through participation in the International Space Station program); the launch and operation of crewless exploration missions to other planets such as Mars and the Moon; Earth observation, science and telecommunication; designing launch vehicles; and maintaining a major spaceport, the Guiana Space Centre at Kourou (French Guiana), France. The main European launch vehicle Ariane 6 will be operated through Arianespace with the ESA sharing in the costs of launching and further developing this launch vehicle. The agency is also working with NASA to manufacture the Orion spacecraft service module that flies on the Space Launch System.
==History==
===Foundation===

After World War II, many European scientists left Western Europe in order to work with the United States. Although the 1950s boom made it possible for Western European countries to invest in research and specifically in space-related activities, Western European scientists realised solely national projects would not be able to compete with the two main superpowers. In 1958, only months after the Sputnik shock, Edoardo Amaldi (Italy) and Pierre Auger (France), two prominent members of the Western European scientific community, met to discuss the foundation of a common Western European space agency. The meeting was attended by scientific representatives from eight countries.

The Western European nations decided to have two agencies: one concerned with developing a launch system, ELDO (European Launcher Development Organisation), and the other the precursor of the European Space Agency, ESRO (European Space Research Organisation). The latter was established on 20 March 1964 by an agreement signed on 14 June 1962. From 1968 to 1972, ESRO launched seven research satellites, but ELDO was not able to deliver a launch vehicle. Both agencies struggled with the underfunding and diverging interests of their participants.

The ESA in its current form was founded with the ESA Convention in 1975, when ESRO was merged with ELDO. The ESA had ten founding member states: Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. These signed the ESA Convention in 1975 and deposited the instruments of ratification by 1980, when the convention came into force. During this interval the agency functioned in a de facto fashion. The ESA launched its first major scientific mission in 1975, Cos-B, a space probe monitoring gamma-ray emissions in the universe, which was first worked on by ESRO.

===Later activities===
The ESA collaborated with NASA on the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE), the world&#x27;s first high-orbit telescope, which was launched in 1978 and operated successfully for 18 years. A number of successful Earth-orbit projects followed, and in 1986 the ESA began Giotto, its first deep-space mission, to study the comets Halley and Grigg–Skjellerup. Hipparcos, a star-mapping mission, was launched in 1989 and in the 1990s SOHO, &quot;Ulysses&quot; and the Hubble Space Telescope were all jointly carried out with NASA. Later scientific missions in cooperation with NASA include the &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; space probe, to which the ESA contributed by building the Titan landing module &quot;Huygens&quot;.

As the successor of ELDO, the ESA has also constructed rockets for scientific and commercial payloads. Ariane 1, launched in 1979, carried mostly commercial payloads into orbit from 1984 onward. The next two versions of the Ariane rocket were intermediate stages in the development of a more advanced launch system, the Ariane 4, which operated between 1988 and 2003 and established the ESA as the world leader in commercial space launches in the 1990s. Although the succeeding Ariane 5 experienced a failure on its first flight, it has since firmly established itself within the heavily competitive commercial space launch market with 112 successful launches until 2021. The successor launch vehicle, the Ariane 6, is under development and had a successful long-firing engine test in November 2023. The ESA plans for the Ariane 6 to launch in June or July 2024.

The beginning of the new millennium saw the ESA become, along with agencies like NASA, JAXA, ISRO, the CSA and Roscosmos, one of the major participants in scientific space research. Although the ESA had relied on co-operation with NASA in previous decades, especially the 1990s, changed circumstances (such as tough legal restrictions on information sharing by the United States military) led to decisions to rely more on itself and on co-operation with Russia. A 2011 press issue thus stated:

Notable ESA programmes include SMART-1, a probe testing cutting-edge space propulsion technology, the &quot;Mars Express&quot; and &quot;Venus Express&quot; missions, as well as the development of the Ariane 5 rocket and its role in the ISS partnership. The ESA maintains its scientific and research projects mainly for astronomy-space missions such as Corot, launched on 27 December 2006, a milestone in the search for exoplanets.

On 21 January 2019, ArianeGroup and Arianespace announced a one-year contract with the ESA to study and prepare for a mission to mine the Moon for lunar regolith.

In 2021 the ESA ministerial council agreed to the &quot;Matosinhos manifesto&quot; which set three priority areas (referred to as &quot;accelerators&quot;) &quot;space for a green future, a rapid and resilient crisis response, and the protection of space assets&quot;, and two further high visibility projects (referred to as &quot;inspirators&quot;) an icy moon sample return mission; and human space exploration. In the same year the recruitment process began for the 2022 European Space Agency Astronaut Group.

1 July 2023 saw the launch of the Euclid spacecraft, developed jointly with the Euclid Consortium, after 10 years of planning and building it is designed to better understand dark energy and dark matter by accurately measuring the accelerating expansion of the universe.

===Facilities===
The agency&#x27;s facilities date back to ESRO and are deliberately distributed among various countries and areas. The most important are the following centres:

*ESA headquarters in Paris, France;
*ESA science missions are based at ESTEC in Noordwijk, Netherlands;
*Earth Observation missions at the ESA Centre for Earth Observation in Frascati, Italy;
*ESA Mission Control (ESOC) is in Darmstadt, Germany;
*The European Astronaut Centre (EAC) that trains astronauts for future missions is situated in Cologne, Germany;
*The European Centre for Space Applications and Telecommunications (ECSAT), a research institute created in 2009, is located in Harwell, England, United Kingdom;
*The European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) is located in Villanueva de la Cañada, Madrid, Spain.
*The European Space Security and Education Centre (ESEC), located in Redu, Belgium; 
*The ESTRACK tracking and deep space communication network.
*Many other facilities are operated by national space agencies in close collaboration with ESA.
**Esrange near Kiruna in Sweden;
**Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, France;
**Toulouse Space Centre, France;
**Institute of Space Propulsion in Lampoldshausen, Germany;
**Columbus Control Centre in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.

==Mission==
The treaty establishing the European Space Agency reads:

The ESA is responsible for setting a unified space and related industrial policy, recommending space objectives to the member states, and integrating national programs like satellite development, into the European program as much as possible.

Jean-Jacques Dordain – ESA&#x27;s Director General (2003–2015) – outlined the European Space Agency&#x27;s mission in a 2003 interview:

==Activities and programmes==
The ESA describes its work in two overlapping ways:
* For the general public, the various fields of work are described as &quot;Activities&quot;.
* Budgets are organised as &quot;Programmes&quot;.

These are either mandatory or optional.

===Activities===
According to the ESA website, the activities are:
*Observing the Earth
*Human and Robotic Exploration
*Launchers
*Navigation
*Space Science
*Space Engineering &amp; Technology
*Operations
*Telecommunications &amp; Integrated Applications
*Preparing for the Future
*Space for Climate

===Programmes===
====Mandatory====
Every member country (known as &#x27;Member States&#x27;) must contribute to these programmes: The European Space Agency Science Programme is a long-term programme of space science missions.

*Technology Development Element Programme
*Science Core Technology Programme
*General Study Programme
*European Component Initiative

====Optional====
Depending on their individual choices the countries can contribute to the following programmes, becoming &#x27;Participating States&#x27;, listed according to:
== Employment ==
As of 2023, Many other facilities are operated by national space agencies in close collaboration with the ESA. The ESA employs around 2,547 people, and thousands of contractors. Initially, new employees are contracted for an expandable four-year term, which is until the organization&#x27;s retirement age of 63. According to the ESA&#x27;s documents, the staff can receive myriad of perks, such as financial childcare support, retirement plans, and financial help when migrating. The ESA also prevents employees from disclosing any private documents or correspondences to outside parties. &quot;Ars Technica&quot;&#x27;s 2023 report, which contained testimonies of 18 people, suggested that there is a widespread harassment between management and its employees, especially with its contractors. Since the ESA is an international organization, unaffiliated with any single nation, any form of legal action is difficult to raise against the organization.

==Member states, funding and budget==
===Membership and contribution to the ESA===
Member states participate to varying degrees with both mandatory space programs and those that are optional. , the mandatory programmes made up 25% of total expenditures while optional space programmes were the other 75%. The ESA has traditionally implemented a policy of &quot;georeturn&quot;, where funds that ESA member states provide to the ESA &quot;are returned in the form of contracts to companies in those countries.&quot;

By 2015, the ESA was an intergovernmental organisation of 22 member states.
The 2008 ESA budget amounted to €3.0 billion whilst the 2009 budget amounted to €3.6 billion. The total budget amounted to about €3.7 billion in 2010, €3.99 billion in 2011, €4.02 billion in 2012, €4.28 billion in 2013, €4.10 billion in 2014, €4.43 billion in 2015, €5.25 billion in 2016, €5.75 billion in 2017, €5.60 billion in 2018, €5.72 billion in 2019, €6,68 billion in 2020, €6.49 billion in 2021, €7.15 billion in 2022, €7.46 billion in 2023 and €7.79 billion in 2024.

English and French are the two official languages of the ESA. Additionally, official documents are also provided in German and documents regarding the Spacelab have been also provided in Italian. If found appropriate, the agency may conduct its correspondence in any language of a member state.

The following table lists all the member states and adjunct members, their ESA convention ratification dates, and their contributions as of 2024:

===Non-full member states===
Previously associated members were Austria, Norway and Finland and Slovenia, all of which later joined the ESA as full members. Since January 2025 there have been four associate members: Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Canada. The three European members have shown interest in full membership and may eventually apply within the next years.

====Latvia====
Latvia became the second current associated member on 30 June 2020, when the Association Agreement was signed by ESA Director Jan Wörner and the Minister of Education and Science of Latvia, Ilga Šuplinska in Riga. The Saeima ratified it on 27 July.

====Lithuania====
In May 2021, Lithuania became the third current associated member. As a consequence its citizens became eligible to apply to the 2022 ESA Astronaut group, applications for which were scheduled to close one week later. The deadline was therefore extended by three weeks to allow Lithuanians a fair chance to apply.

====Slovakia====
Slovakia&#x27;s Associate membership came into effect on 13 October 2022, for an initial duration of seven years. The Association Agreement supersedes the European Cooperating State (ECS) Agreement, which entered into force upon Slovakia&#x27;s subscription to the Plan for European Cooperating States Charter on 4 February 2016, a scheme introduced at ESA in 2001. The ECS Agreement was subsequently extended until 3 August 2022.

====Canada====
Since 1 January 1979, Canada has had the special status of a Cooperating State within the ESA. By virtue of this accord, the Canadian Space Agency takes part in the ESA&#x27;s deliberative bodies and decision-making and also in the ESA&#x27;s programmes and activities. Canadian firms can bid for and receive contracts to work on programmes. The accord has a provision ensuring a fair industrial return to Canada. The most recent Cooperation Agreement was signed on 15 December 2010 with a term extending to 2020. For 2014, Canada&#x27;s annual assessed contribution to the ESA general budget was €6,059,449 (CAD$8,559,050). For 2017, Canada has increased its annual contribution to €21,600,000 (CAD$30,000,000).

===Budget appropriation and allocation===
The ESA is funded from annual contributions by national governments of members as well as from an annual contribution by the European Union (EU).

The budget of the ESA was €5.250 billion in 2016. Every 3–4 years, ESA member states agree on a budget plan for several years at an ESA member states conference. This plan can be amended in future years, however provides the major guideline for the ESA for several years. The 2016 budget allocations for major areas of the ESA activity are shown in the chart on the right.

Countries typically have their own space programmes that differ in how they operate organisationally and financially with the ESA. For example, the French space agency CNES has a total budget of €2,015 million, of which €755 million is paid as direct financial contribution to the ESA. Several space-related projects are joint projects between national space agencies and the ESA (e.g. COROT). Also, the ESA is not the only European governmental space organisation (for example European Union Satellite Centre and the European Union Space Programme Agency).

===Enlargement===

After the decision of the ESA Council of 21/22 March 2001, the procedure for accession of the European states was detailed as described the document titled &quot;The Plan for European Co-operating States (PECS)&quot;. Nations that want to become a full member of the ESA do so in 3 stages. First a Cooperation Agreement is signed between the country and ESA. In this stage, the country has very limited financial responsibilities. If a country wants to co-operate more fully with ESA, it signs a European Cooperating State (ECS) Agreement, albeit to be a candidate for said agreement, a country must be European. The ECS Agreement makes companies based in the country eligible for participation in ESA procurements. The country can also participate in all ESA programmes, except for the Basic Technology Research Programme. While the financial contribution of the country concerned increases, it is still much lower than that of a full member state. The agreement is normally followed by a Plan For European Cooperating State (or PECS Charter). This is a 5-year programme of basic research and development activities aimed at improving the nation&#x27;s space industry capacity. At the end of the 5-year period, the country can either begin negotiations to become a full member state or an associated state or sign a new PECS Charter. Many countries, most of which joined the EU in both 2004 and 2007, have started to co-operate with the ESA on various levels:

During the Ministerial Meeting in December 2014, ESA ministers approved a resolution calling for discussions to begin with Israel, Australia and South Africa on future association agreements. The ministers noted that &quot;concrete cooperation is at an advanced stage&quot; with these nations and that &quot;prospects for mutual benefits are existing&quot;.

A separate space exploration strategy resolution calls for further co-operation with the United States, Russia and China on &quot;LEO exploration, including a continuation of ISS cooperation and the development of a robust plan for the coordinated use of space transportation vehicles and systems for exploration purposes, participation in robotic missions for the exploration of the Moon, the robotic exploration of Mars, leading to a broad Mars Sample Return mission in which Europe should be involved as a full partner, and human missions beyond LEO in the longer term.&quot;

In August 2019, the ESA and the Australian Space Agency signed a joint statement of intent &quot;to explore deeper cooperation and identify projects in a range of areas including deep space, communications, navigation, remote asset management, data analytics and mission support.&quot; Details of the cooperation were laid out in a framework agreement signed by the two entities.

On 17 November 2020, ESA signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the South African National Space Agency (SANSA). SANSA CEO Dr. Valanathan Munsami tweeted: &quot;Today saw another landmark event for SANSA with the signing of an MoU with the ESA. This builds on initiatives that we have been discussing for a while already and which gives effect to these. Thanks Jan for your hand of friendship and making this possible.&quot;
==Launch vehicles==
The ESA currently has two operational launch vehicles Vega-C and Ariane 6. Rocket launches are carried out by Arianespace, which has 23 shareholders representing the industry that manufactures the Ariane 5 as well as CNES, at the ESA&#x27;s Guiana Space Centre. Because many communication satellites have equatorial orbits, launches from French Guiana are able to take larger payloads into space than from spaceports at higher latitudes. In addition, equatorial launches give spacecraft an extra &#x27;push&#x27; of nearly 500 m/s due to the higher rotational velocity of the Earth at the equator compared to near the Earth&#x27;s poles where rotational velocity approaches zero.

===Ariane 6===

Ariane 6 is a heavy lift expendable launch vehicle developed by Arianespace. The Ariane 6 entered into its inaugural flight campaign on 26 April 2024 with the flight conducted on 9 July 2024.

===Vega-C===

Vega is the ESA&#x27;s carrier for small satellites. Developed by seven ESA members led by Italy. It is capable of carrying a payload with a mass of between 300 and 1500 kg to an altitude of 700 km, for low polar orbit. Its maiden launch from Kourou was on 13 February 2012. Vega began full commercial exploitation in December 2015.

The rocket has three solid propulsion stages and a liquid propulsion upper stage (the AVUM) for accurate orbital insertion and the ability to place multiple payloads into different orbits.

A larger version of the Vega launcher, Vega-C had its first flight in July 2022. The new evolution of the rocket incorporates a larger first stage booster, the P120C replacing the P80, an upgraded Zefiro (rocket stage) second stage, and the AVUM+ upper stage. This new variant enables larger single payloads, dual payloads, return missions, and orbital transfer capabilities.

===Ariane launch vehicle development funding===
Historically, the Ariane family rockets have been funded primarily &quot;with money contributed by ESA governments seeking to participate in the program rather than through competitive industry bids. This [has meant that] governments commit multiyear funding to the development with the expectation of a roughly 90% return on investment in the form of industrial workshare.&quot; ESA is proposing changes to this scheme by moving to competitive bids for the development of the Ariane 6.

===Future rocket development===
Future projects include the Prometheus reusable engine technology demonstrator, Phoebus (an upgraded second stage for Ariane 6), and Themis (a reusable first stage).

==Human space flight==

===Formation and development===

At the time the ESA was formed, its main goals did not encompass human space flight; rather it considered itself to be primarily a scientific research organisation for uncrewed space exploration in contrast to its American and Soviet counterparts. It is therefore not surprising that the first non-Soviet European in space was not an ESA astronaut on a European space craft; it was Czechoslovak Vladimír Remek who in 1978 became the first non-Soviet or American in space (the first man in space being Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union) – on a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft, followed by the Pole Mirosław Hermaszewski and East German Sigmund Jähn in the same year. This Soviet co-operation programme, known as Intercosmos, primarily involved the participation of Eastern bloc countries. In 1982, however, Jean-Loup Chrétien became the first non-Communist Bloc astronaut on a flight to the Soviet Salyut 7 space station.

Because Chrétien did not officially fly into space as an ESA astronaut, but rather as a member of the French CNES astronaut corps, the German Ulf Merbold is considered the first ESA astronaut to fly into space. He participated in the STS-9 Space Shuttle mission that included the first use of the European-built Spacelab in 1983. STS-9 marked the beginning of an extensive ESA/NASA joint partnership that included dozens of space flights of ESA astronauts in the following years. Some of these missions with Spacelab were fully funded and organisationally and scientifically controlled by the ESA (such as two missions by Germany and one by Japan) with European astronauts as full crew members rather than guests on board. Beside paying for Spacelab flights and seats on the shuttles, the ESA continued its human space flight co-operation with the Soviet Union and later Russia, including numerous visits to Mir.

During the latter half of the 1980s, European human space flights changed from being the exception to routine and therefore, in 1990, the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany was established. It selects and trains prospective astronauts and is responsible for the co-ordination with international partners, especially with regard to the International Space Station. As of 2006, the ESA astronaut corps officially included twelve members, including nationals from most large European countries except the United Kingdom.

In 2008, the ESA started to recruit new astronauts so that final selection would be due in spring 2009. Almost 10,000 people registered as astronaut candidates before registration ended in June 2008. 8,413 fulfilled the initial application criteria. Of the applicants, 918 were chosen to take part in the first stage of psychological testing, which narrowed down the field to 192. After two-stage psychological tests and medical evaluation in early 2009, as well as formal interviews, six new members of the European Astronaut Corps were selected – five men and one woman.

===Crew vehicles===
In the 1980s, France pressed for an independent European crew launch vehicle. Around 1978, it was decided to pursue a reusable spacecraft model and starting in November 1987 a project to create a mini-shuttle by the name of Hermes was introduced. The craft was comparable to early proposals for the Space Shuttle and consisted of a small reusable spaceship that would carry 3 to 5 astronauts and 3 to 4 metric tons of payload for scientific experiments. With a total maximum weight of 21 metric tons it would have been launched on the Ariane 5 rocket, which was being developed at that time. It was planned solely for use in low Earth orbit space flights. The planning and pre-development phase concluded in 1991; the production phase was never fully implemented because at that time the political landscape had changed significantly. With the fall of the Soviet Union, the ESA looked forward to co-operation with Russia to build a next-generation space vehicle. Thus the Hermes programme was cancelled in 1995 after about 3 billion dollars had been spent. The Columbus space station programme had a similar fate.

In the 21st century, the ESA started new programmes in order to create its own crew vehicles, most notable among its various projects and proposals is Hopper, whose prototype by EADS, called Phoenix, has already been tested. While projects such as Hopper are neither concrete nor to be realised within the next decade, other possibilities for human spaceflight in co-operation with the Russian Space Agency have emerged. Following talks with the Russian Space Agency in 2004 and June 2005, a co-operation between the ESA and the Russian Space Agency was announced to jointly work on the Russian-designed Kliper, a reusable spacecraft that would be available for space travel beyond LEO (e.g. the moon or even Mars). It was speculated that Europe would finance part of it. A €50 million participation study for Kliper, which was expected to be approved in December 2005, was finally not approved by ESA member states. The Russian state tender for the project was subsequently cancelled in 2006.

In June 2006, ESA member states granted 15 million to the Crew Space Transportation System (CSTS) study, a two-year study to design a spacecraft capable of going beyond Low-Earth orbit based on the current Soyuz design. This project was pursued with Roskosmos instead of the cancelled Kliper proposal. A decision on the actual implementation and construction of the CSTS spacecraft was contemplated for 2008.
In mid-2009 EADS Astrium was awarded a €21 million study into designing a crew vehicle based on the European ATV which is believed to now be the basis of the Advanced Crew Transportation System design.

In November 2012, the ESA decided to join NASA&#x27;s Orion programme. The ATV would form the basis of a propulsion unit for NASA&#x27;s new crewed spacecraft. The ESA may also seek to work with NASA on Orion&#x27;s launch system as well in order to secure a seat on the spacecraft for its own astronauts.

In September 2014, the ESA signed an agreement with Sierra Nevada Corporation for co-operation in Dream Chaser project. Further studies on the Dream Chaser for European Utilization or DC4EU project were funded, including the feasibility of launching a Europeanised Dream Chaser onboard Ariane 5.

==Cooperation with other countries and organisations==
The ESA has signed co-operation agreements with the following states that currently neither plan to integrate as tightly with ESA institutions as Canada, nor envision future membership of the ESA: Argentina, Brazil, China, India (for the Chandrayan mission), Russia and Turkey.

Additionally, the ESA has joint projects with the EUSPA of the European Union, NASA of the United States and is participating in the International Space Station together with the United States (NASA), Russia and Japan (JAXA).

===National space organisations of member states===
*The &quot;Centre National d&#x27;Études Spatiales&quot; (CNES) (National Centre for Space Study) is the French government space agency (administratively, a &quot;public establishment of industrial and commercial character&quot;). Its headquarters are in central Paris. CNES is the main participant on the Ariane project. Indeed, CNES designed and tested all Ariane family rockets (mainly from its centre in Évry near Paris)
*The UK Space Agency is a partnership of the UK government departments which are active in space. Through the UK Space Agency, the partners provide delegates to represent the UK on the various ESA governing bodies. Each partner funds its own programme.
*The Italian Space Agency (&quot;Agenzia Spaziale Italiana&quot; or ASI) was founded in 1988 to promote, co-ordinate and conduct space activities in Italy. Operating under the Ministry of the Universities and of Scientific and Technological Research, the agency cooperates with numerous entities active in space technology and with the president of the Council of Ministers. Internationally, the ASI provides Italy&#x27;s delegation to the Council of the European Space Agency and to its subordinate bodies.
*The German Aerospace Center (DLR) (German: &quot;Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e. V.&quot;) is the national research centre for aviation and space flight of the Federal Republic of Germany and of other member states in the Helmholtz Association. Its extensive research and development projects are included in national and international cooperative programmes. In addition to its research projects, the centre is the assigned space agency of Germany bestowing headquarters of German space flight activities and its associates.
*The Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial (INTA) (National Institute for Aerospace Technique) is a Public Research Organisation specialised in aerospace research and technology development in Spain. Among other functions, it serves as a platform for space research and acts as a significant testing facility for the aeronautic and space sector in the country.

===NASA===
The ESA has a long history of collaboration with NASA. Since ESA&#x27;s astronaut corps was formed, the Space Shuttle has been the primary launch vehicle used by the ESA&#x27;s astronauts to get into space through partnership programmes with NASA. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Spacelab programme was an ESA-NASA joint research programme that had the ESA develop and manufacture orbital labs for the Space Shuttle for several flights in which the ESA participates with astronauts in experiments.

In robotic science mission and exploration missions, NASA has been the ESA&#x27;s main partner. &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; was a joint NASA-ESA mission, along with the Infrared Space Observatory, INTEGRAL, SOHO, and others. Also, the Hubble Space Telescope is a joint project of NASA and the ESA. Future ESA-NASA joint projects include the James Webb Space Telescope and the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. NASA has supported the ESA&#x27;s MarcoPolo-R mission which landed on asteroid Bennu in October 2020 and is scheduled to return a sample to Earth for further analysis in 2023. NASA and the ESA will also likely join for a Mars sample-return mission. In October 2020, the ESA entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with NASA to work together on the Artemis program, which will provide an orbiting Lunar Gateway and also accomplish the first crewed lunar landing in 50 years, whose team will include the first woman on the Moon. Astronaut selection announcements are expected within two years of the 2024 scheduled launch date. The ESA also purchases seats on the NASA operated Commercial Crew Program. The first ESA astronaut to be on a Commercial Crew Program mission is Thomas Pesquet. Pesquet launched into space aboard Crew Dragon Endeavour on the Crew-2 mission. The ESA also has seats on Crew-3 with Matthias Maurer and Crew-4 with Samantha Cristoforetti.

=== SpaceX ===
In 2023, following the successful launch of the Euclid telescope in July on a Falcon 9 rocket, the ESA approached SpaceX to launch four Galileo communication satellites on two Falcon 9 rockets in 2024, however it would require approval from the European Commission and all member states of the European Union to proceed.

===Cooperation with other space agencies===
Since China has invested more money into space activities, the Chinese Space Agency has sought international partnerships. Besides the Russian Space Agency, ESA is one of its most important partners. Both space agencies cooperated in the development of the Double Star Mission. In 2017, the ESA sent two astronauts to China for two weeks sea survival training with Chinese astronauts in Yantai, Shandong.

The ESA entered into a major joint venture with Russia in the form of the CSTS, the preparation of French Guiana spaceport for launches of Soyuz-2 rockets and other projects. With India, the ESA agreed to send instruments into space aboard the ISRO&#x27;s Chandrayaan-1 in 2008. The ESA is also co-operating with Japan, the most notable current project in collaboration with JAXA is the &quot;BepiColombo&quot; mission to Mercury.

===International Space Station===

With regard to the International Space Station (ISS), the ESA is not represented by all of its member states: 11 of the 22 ESA member states currently participate in the project: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom. Austria, Finland and Ireland chose not to participate, because of lack of interest or concerns about the expense of the project. Portugal, Luxembourg, Greece, the Czech Republic, Romania, Poland, Estonia and Hungary joined ESA after the agreement had been signed.

The ESA takes part in the construction and operation of the ISS, with contributions such as Columbus, a science laboratory module that was brought into orbit by NASA&#x27;s STS-122 Space Shuttle mission, and the Cupola observatory module that was completed in July 2005 by Alenia Spazio for the ESA. The current estimates for the ISS are approaching €100 billion in total (development, construction and 10 years of maintaining the station) of which the ESA has committed to paying €8 billion. About 90% of the costs of the ESA&#x27;s ISS share will be contributed by Germany (41%), France (28%) and Italy (20%). German ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter was the first long-term ISS crew member.

The ESA has developed the Automated Transfer Vehicle for ISS resupply. Each ATV has a cargo capacity of . The first ATV, &quot;Jules Verne&quot;, was launched on 9 March 2008 and on 3 April 2008 successfully docked with the ISS. This manoeuvre, considered a major technical feat, involved using automated systems to allow the ATV to track the ISS, moving at 27,000 km/h, and attach itself with an accuracy of 2 cm. Five vehicles were launched before the program ended with the launch of the fifth ATV, &quot;Georges Lemaître&quot;, in 2014.

As of 2020, the spacecraft establishing supply links to the ISS are the Russian Progress and Soyuz, Japanese Kounotori (HTV), and the United States vehicles Cargo Dragon 2 and Cygnus stemmed from the Commercial Resupply Services program.

European Life and Physical Sciences research on board the International Space Station (ISS) is mainly based on the European Programme for Life and Physical Sciences in Space programme that was initiated in 2001.

==Link between ESA and EU==

The ESA is an independent space agency and not under the jurisdiction of the European Union, although they have common goals, share funding, and work together often.
The initial aim of the European Union (EU) was to make the European Space Agency an agency of the EU by 2014. While the EU and its member states fund together 86% of the budget of the ESA, it is not an EU agency. Furthermore, the ESA has several non-EU members, most notably the United Kingdom which left the EU while remaining a full member of the ESA. The ESA is partnered with the EU on its two current flagship space programmes, the Copernicus series of Earth observation satellites and the Galileo satellite navigation system, with the ESA providing technical oversight and, in the case of Copernicus, some of the funding. The EU, though, has shown an interest in expanding into new areas, whence the proposal to rename and expand its satellite navigation agency (the European GNSS Agency) into the EU Agency for the Space Programme. The proposal drew strong criticism from the ESA, as it was perceived as encroaching on the ESA&#x27;s turf.

In January 2021, after years of acrimonious relations, EU and ESA officials mended their relationship, with the EU Internal Market commissioner Thierry Breton saying &quot;The European space policy will continue to rely on the ESA and its unique technical, engineering and science expertise,&quot; and that the &quot;ESA will continue to be the European agency for space matters. If we are to be successful in our European strategy for space, and we will be, I will need the ESA by my side.&quot; ESA director Aschbacher reciprocated, saying &quot;I would really like to make the ESA the main agency, the go-to agency of the European Commission for all its flagship programmes.&quot; The ESA and EUSPA are now seen to have distinct roles and competencies, which will be officialised in the Financial Framework Partnership Agreement (FFPA). Whereas the ESA&#x27;s focus will be on the technical elements of the EU space programmes, the EUSPA will handle the operational elements of those programmes.

==Security incidents==
On 3 August 1984, the ESA&#x27;s Paris headquarters were severely damaged and six people were hurt when a bomb exploded. It was planted by the far-left armed Action Directe group.

On 14 December 2015, hackers from Anonymous breached the ESA&#x27;s subdomains and leaked thousands of login credentials.

<doc id="10365" wikidata="Q175234" url="?curid=10365" title="Embouchure">
<text>Embouchure () or lipping is the use of the lips, facial muscles, tongue, and teeth in playing a wind instrument. This includes shaping the lips to the mouthpiece of a woodwind or brass instrument. The word is of French origin and is related to the root &quot;&quot;, &#x27;mouth&#x27;. Proper embouchure allows instrumentalists to play their instrument at its full range with a full, clear tone and without strain or damage to their muscles.

==Brass embouchure==
While performing on a brass instrument, the sound is produced by the player buzzing their lips into a mouthpiece. Pitches are changed in part through altering the amount of muscular contraction in the lip formation. The performer&#x27;s use of the air, tightening of cheek and jaw muscles, as well as tongue manipulation can affect how the embouchure works.

Maintaining an effective embouchure is an essential skill for any brass instrumentalist, but its personal and particular characteristics mean that different pedagogues and researchers have advocated differing, even contradictory, advice on what proper embouchure is and how it should be taught. One point on which there is some agreement is that proper embouchure is not one-size-fits-all: individual differences in dental structure, lip shape and size, jaw shape and the degree of jaw malocclusion, and other anatomical factors will affect whether a particular embouchure technique will be effective or not.

In 1962, Philip Farkas hypothesized that the air stream traveling through the lip aperture should be directed straight down the shank of the mouthpiece. He believed that it would be illogical to &quot;violently deflect&quot; the air stream downward at the point of where the air moves past the lips. In this text, Farkas also recommends that the lower jaw be protruded so that the upper and lower teeth are aligned.

In 1970, Farkas published a second text which contradicted his earlier writing. Out of 40 subjects, Farkas showed that 39 subjects directed the air downward to varying degrees and one subject directed the air in an upward direction at various degrees. The lower jaw position seen in these photographs shows more variation from his earlier text as well.

This supports what was written by trombonist and brass pedagogue Donald S. Reinhardt in 1942. In 1972, Reinhardt described and labeled different embouchure patterns according to such characteristics as mouthpiece placement and the general direction of the air stream as it travels past the lips. According to this later text, players who place the mouthpiece higher on the lips, so that more upper lip is inside the mouthpiece, will direct the air downwards to varying degrees while playing. Performers who place the mouthpiece lower, so that more lower lip is inside the mouthpiece, will direct the air to varying degrees in an upward manner. In order for the performer to be successful, the air stream direction and mouthpiece placement need to be personalized based on individual anatomical differences. Lloyd Leno confirmed the existence of both upstream and downstream embouchures.

More controversial was Reinhardt&#x27;s description and recommendations regarding a phenomenon he termed a &quot;pivot&quot;. According to Reinhardt, a successful brass embouchure depends on a motion wherein the performer moves both the mouthpiece and lips as a single unit along the teeth in an upward and downward direction. As the performer ascends in pitch, he or she will either move the lips and mouthpiece together slightly up towards the nose or pull them down together slightly towards the chin, and use the opposite motion to descend in pitch. Whether the player uses one general pivot direction or the other, and the degree to which the motion is performed, depends on the performer&#x27;s anatomical features and stage of development. The placement of the mouthpiece upon the lips doesn&#x27;t change, but rather the relationship of the rim and lips to the teeth. While the angle of the instrument may change as this motion follows the shape of the teeth and placement of the jaw, contrary to what many brass performers and teachers believe, the angle of the instrument does not actually constitute the motion Reinhardt advised as a pivot.

Later research supports Reinhardt&#x27;s claim that this motion exists and might be advisable for brass performers to adopt. John Froelich describes how mouthpiece pressure towards the lips (vertical forces) and shear pressure (horizontal forces) functioned in three test groups, student trombonists, professional trombonists, and professional symphonic trombonists. Froelich noted that the symphonic trombonists used the least amount of both direct and shear forces and recommends this model be followed. Other research notes that virtually all brass performers rely upon the upward and downward embouchure motion. Other authors and pedagogues remain skeptical about the necessity of this motion, but scientific evidence supporting this view has not been sufficiently developed at this time.

Some noted brass pedagogues prefer to instruct the use of the embouchure from a less analytical point of view. Arnold Jacobs, a tubist and well-regarded brass teacher, believed that it was best for the student to focus on his or her use of the air and musical expression to allow the embouchure to develop naturally on its own. Other instructors, such as Carmine Caruso, believed that the brass player&#x27;s embouchure could best be developed through coordination exercises and drills that bring all the muscles into balance that focus the student&#x27;s attention on his or her time perception. Still other authors who have differing approaches to embouchure development include Louis Maggio, Jeff Smiley, Jerome Callet and Clint McLaughlin.

===Farkas embouchure===
Most professional performers, as well as instructors, use a combination called a puckered smile. Farkas told people to blow as if they were trying to cool soup. Raphael Mendez advised saying the letter &quot;M&quot;. The skin under the lower lip will be taut with no air pocket. The lips do not overlap nor do they roll in or out. The corners of the mouth are held firmly in place. To play with an extended range one should use a pivot, tongue arch and lip to lip compression.

According to Farkas the mouthpiece should have upper lip and lower lip (French horn), lower lip and upper lip (trumpet and cornet), and more latitude for lower brass (trombone, baritone, and tuba). For trumpet, some also advocate upper lip and lower lip. Farkas claimed placement was more important for the instruments with smaller mouthpieces. The lips should not overlap each other, nor should they roll in or out. The mouth corners should be held firm. Farkas speculated that the horn should be held in a downward angle to allow the air stream to go straight into the mouthpiece, although his later text shows that air stream direction actually is either upstream or downstream and is dependent upon the ratio of upper or lower lip inside the mouthpiece, not the horn angle. Farkas advised to moisten the outside of the lips, then form the embouchure and gently place the mouthpiece on it. He also recommended there must be a gap of or so between the teeth so that the air flows freely.

===Arban vs. Saint-Jacome===
Arban and Saint-Jacome were both cornet soloists and authors of well respected and still used method books. Arban stated undogmatically that he believed the mouthpiece should be placed on the top lip. Saint-Jacome to the contrary said dogmatically that the mouthpiece should be placed &quot;two-thirds for the upper and the rest for the under according to all professors and one-third for the upper and two-thirds for the under according to one sole individual, whom I shall not name.&quot;

====Buzzing embouchure====
The Farkas set is the basis of most lip buzzing embouchures. Mendez did teach lip buzzing by making the student lip buzz for a month before they could play their trumpet and got great results. One can initiate this type of buzz by using the same sensation as spitting seeds, but maintaining a continued flow of air. This technique assists the development of the Farkas approach by preventing the player from using an aperture that is too open.

===Stevens–Costello embouchure===

Stevens–Costello embouchure has its origins in the William Costello embouchure and was further developed by Roy Stevens. It uses a slight rolling in of both lips and touching evenly all the way across. It also uses mouthpiece placement of about 40–50% top lip and 50–60% lower lip. The teeth will be about apart and the teeth are parallel or the jaw slightly forward.

There is relative mouthpiece pressure to the given air column. One exercise to practice the proper weight to air relationship is the palm exercise where the player holds the horn by laying it on its side in the palm of the hand, not grasping it. The lips are placed on the mouthpiece and the player blows utilizing the weight of the horn in establishing a sound.

===Maggio embouchure===

A puckered embouchure, used by most players, and sometimes used by jazz players for extremely high &quot;screamer&quot; notes. Maggio claimed that the pucker embouchure gives more endurance than some systems. Carlton MacBeth is the main proponent of the pucker embouchure. The Maggio system was established because Louis Maggio had sustained an injury which prevented him from playing. In this system the player cushions the lips by extending them or puckering (like a monkey). This puckering enables the players to overcome physical malformations. It also lets the player play for an extended time in the upper register. The pucker can make it easy to use to open an aperture. Much very soft practice can help overcome this. Claude Gordon was a student of Louis Maggio and Herbert L. Clarke and systematized the concepts of these teachers. Claude Gordon made use of pedal tones for embouchure development as did Maggio and Herbert L. Clarke. All three stressed that the mouthpiece should be placed higher on the top lip for a more free vibration of the lips.

===Tongue-controlled embouchure===

This embouchure method, advocated by a minority of brass pedagogues such as Jerome Callet, has not yet been sufficiently researched to support the claims that this system is the most effective approach for all brass performers.

Advocates of Callet&#x27;s approach believe that this method was recommended and taught by the great brass instructors of the early 20th century. Two French trumpet technique books, authored by Jean-Baptiste Arban and Saint-Jacome, were translated into English for use by American players. According to some, due to a misunderstanding arising from differences in pronunciation between French and English, the commonly used brass embouchure in Europe was incorrectly interpreted. Callet attributes this difference in embouchure technique as the reason the great players of the past were able to play at the level of technical virtuosity which they did, although the increased difficulty of contemporary compositions for brass seem to indicate that the level of brass technique achieved by today&#x27;s performers equals or even exceeds that of most performers from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Callet&#x27;s method of brass embouchure consists of the tongue remaining forward and through the teeth at all times. The corners of the mouth always remain relaxed, and only a small amount of air is used. The top and bottom lips curl inward and grip the forward tongue. The tongue will force the teeth, and subsequently the throat, wide open, supposedly resulting in a bigger, more open sound. The forward tongue resists the pressure of the mouthpiece, controls the flow of air for lower and higher notes, and protects the lips and teeth from damage or injury from mouthpiece pressure. Because of the importance of the tongue in this method many refer to this as a &quot;tongue-controlled embouchure&quot;. This technique facilitates the use of a smaller mouthpiece and larger bore instruments. It results in improved intonation and stronger harmonically related partials across the player&#x27;s range.

==Woodwind embouchure==
===Flute embouchure===

A variety of transverse flute embouchures are employed by professional flautists, though the most natural form is perfectly symmetrical, the corners of the mouth relaxed (i.e. not smiling), the lower lip placed along and at a short distance from the embouchure hole. It must be stressed, however, that achieving a symmetrical, or perfectly centred blowing hole ought not to be an end in itself. Indeed, French flautist Marcel Moyse did not play with a symmetrical embouchure.

The end-blown xiao, kaval, shakuhachi and hocchiku flutes demand especially difficult embouchures, sometimes requiring many lessons before any sound can be produced.

The embouchure is an important element to tone production. The right embouchure, developed with &quot;time, patience, and intelligent work&quot;, will produce a beautiful sound and a correct intonation. The embouchure is produced with the muscles around the lips: principally the orbicularis oris muscle and the depressor anguli oris, whilst avoiding activation of zygomaticus major, which will produce a smile, flattening the top lip against the maxillary (upper jaw) teeth. Beginner flute-players tend to suffer fatigue in these muscles, and notably struggle to use the depressor muscle, which necessarily helps to keep the top lip directing the flow of air across the embouchure hole. These muscles have to be properly warmed up and exercised before practicing. Tone-development exercises including long notes and harmonics must be done as part of the warm up daily.

Some further adjustments to the embouchure are necessary when moving from the transverse orchestral flute to the piccolo. With the piccolo, it becomes necessary to place the near side of the embouchure hole slightly higher on the lower lip, i.e. above the lip margin, and greater muscle tone from the lip muscles is needed to keep the stream/pressure of air directed across the smaller embouchure hole, particularly when playing in higher piccolo registers.

===Reed instrument embouchure===

With the woodwinds, aside from the flute, piccolo, and recorder, the sound is generated by a reed and not with the lips. The embouchure is therefore based on sealing the area around the reed and mouthpiece. This serves to prevent air from escaping while simultaneously supporting the reed, allowing it to vibrate, and constrict the reed preventing it from vibrating too much. With woodwinds, it is important to ensure that the mouthpiece is not placed too far into the mouth, which would result in too much vibration (no control), often creating a sound an octave (or harmonic twelfth for the clarinet) above the intended note. If the mouthpiece is not placed far enough into the mouth, no sound will be generated, as the reed will not vibrate.

The standard embouchures for single reed woodwinds like the clarinet and saxophone are variants of the &quot;single lip embouchure&quot;, formed by resting the reed upon the bottom lip, which rests on the teeth and is supported by the chin muscles and the buccinator muscles on the sides of the mouth. The top teeth rest on top of the mouthpiece. The manner in which the lower lip rests against the teeth differs between clarinet and saxophone embouchures. In clarinet playing, the lower lip is rolled over the teeth and corners of the mouth are drawn back, which has the effect of drawing the upper lip around the mouthpiece to create a seal due to the angle at which the mouthpiece rests in the mouth. With the saxophone embouchure, the lower lip rests against, but not over, the teeth as in pronouncing the letter &quot;V&quot; and the corners of the lip are drawn in (similar to a drawstring bag). With the less common double-lip embouchure, the top lip is placed under (around) the top teeth, an alternative embouchure sometimes recommended by dentists for single-reed players for whom the single-lip approach is potentially harmful. In both instances, the position of the tongue in the mouth plays a vital role in focusing and accelerating the air stream blown by the player. This results in a more mature and full sound, rich in overtones.

The double reed woodwinds, the oboe and bassoon, have no mouthpiece. Instead the reed is two pieces of cane extending from a metal tube (oboe – staple) or placed on a bocal (bassoon, English horn). The reed is placed directly on the lips and then played like the double-lip embouchure described above. Compared to the single reed woodwinds, the reed is very small and subtle changes in the embouchure can have a dramatic effect on tuning, tone and pitch control.

<text>The Elephant 6 Recording Company is a loosely defined musical collective from the United States. Notable bands associated with the collective include The Apples in Stereo, Beulah, Circulatory System, Elf Power, The Minders, Neutral Milk Hotel, of Montreal, and The Olivia Tremor Control. Although bands in Elephant 6 explore many different genres, they have a shared interest in psychedelic pop of the 1960s, with particular influence from bands such as the Beach Boys, the Beatles, and the Zombies. Their music sometimes features intentionally low fidelity production and experimental recording techniques.

The collective started in Ruston, Louisiana in the late 1980s. The name was occasionally used to denote the home recordings made by four high school friends: Bill Doss, Will Cullen Hart, Jeff Mangum, and Robert Schneider. After high school, Schneider formed the Apples in Stereo; Doss, Hart, and Mangum formed the Olivia Tremor Control; and Mangum independently formed Neutral Milk Hotel. These three bands would serve as the basis for Elephant 6, and soon, many other bands joined. Athens, Georgia, and Denver, Colorado, became major hub cities, and the mid-to-late 1990s represented the peak years of activity for the collective.

Due to the confluence of new bands and the dissolution of Neutral Milk Hotel and the Olivia Tremor Control, the collective stagnated in activity in the early 2000s. A brief resurgence in the late 2000s ended with the death of Doss, and in recent years the collective has remained relatively dormant. Journalists have described Elephant 6 as an important underground music movement, and a key contributor to the emergence of alternative rock and indie rock in the 1990s.

==History==
===Background and formation===
Noel Murray and Marcus Gilmer of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; note the difficulty in defining the exact parameters of the collective due to the multitude of associated acts. Each act has their own unique sound, and musicians are often members of multiple bands. This problem is compounded by the fact that members will sometimes obfuscate the truth, such as misleading a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reporter into believing they lived in a communal compound in Athens. In 2012, the official Elephant 6 website read: &quot;A collective, a label ... a cult? Elephant 6 may be all of these things or none of these depending on your point of view. And we&#x27;re certainly not going to try to define what it is now!&quot;

Elephant 6 originated in Ruston, Louisiana, in the late 1980s. The name was occasionally used to denote home recordings made by four high school friends: Bill Doss, Will Cullen Hart, Jeff Mangum, and Robert Schneider. These recordings were circulated between the four of them, and they did not seek approval from record labels or fanzines. Musician Laura Carter said: &quot;They were just 13-year-old boys yelling, &#x27;Fuck your mama,&#x27; and bashing on the drums as hard as they can. It was just kids having fun, and they would fill up a whole cassette tape with this.&quot; When the group decided to create an imaginary label for their music, Hart came up with the name Elephant 6.

When the four friends graduated high school, they dispersed to different cities in the United States, but continued to mail tapes to each other. Schneider moved to Denver, Colorado and formed a band called the Apples in 1992 with Jim McIntyre, Hilarie Sidney and Chris Parfitt. Doss, Hart, and Mangum moved to Athens, Georgia. The three were drawn to the city&#x27;s burgeoning music scene, and played in a band called the Synthetic Flying Machine. While in Athens, the group began collaborating with New York musician Julian Koster. In 1993, the Synthetic Flying Machine evolved into a band called the Olivia Tremor Control, and the band gained local attention for their psychedelic sound, which was in contrast to the prevalent grunge sound of the 1990s.

In the 1990s, bands joined Elephant 6 through invitation. Inspired by the Surrealist Manifestos, members of the collective issued their own manifesto in small hand-drawn catalogs, found within early releases. According to Schneider: &quot;We wanted [to find] these little pockets of people in different cities who listened to Pavement and the Beach Boys and were recording on 4-tracks.&quot; Schneider notes that another way a band may join is by simply having a similar sound. He uses Beulah as an example, and in reference to the band&#x27;s sound, he said: &quot;This is a kindred spirit. This is Elephant 6.&quot;

Schneider created a record label called the Elephant 6 Recording Company as a vehicle for the Apples music, and in 1993, the first recording released on the label was an extended play titled &quot;Tidal Wave&quot;. Around this time, Mangum left the Olivia Tremor Control, and became a vagabond. While living in Seattle, Mangum released the song &quot;Everything Is&quot; on Cher Doll Records in 1994, and was the first member of the collective to have their music released on a mainstream label, although the release was not directly affiliated with the Elephant 6 collective and did not feature the Elephant 6 logo. Mangum released the song under the name Neutral Milk Hotel. The Apples were later known as the Apples in Stereo.

===Peak years===

The mid-to-late 1990s saw the greatest amount of activity for the collective. The three main bands associated with Elephant 6 at the time–the Apples in Stereo, the Olivia Tremor Control, and Neutral Milk Hotel–grew in popularity, and each respectively released a notable album: &quot;Fun Trick Noisemaker&quot;, &quot;Music from the Unrealized Film Script: Dusk at Cubist Castle&quot;, and &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote highly of &quot;In the Aereoplane Over the Sea&quot;, saying it &quot;is the culmination of everything the [Elephant 6] collective was about in the mid-&#x27;90s: distinctive, ragged, catchy records ripped straight from their makers&#x27; veins.&quot;

Many bands associated with the collective were formed during this period, and Athens became a major hub city. Elf Power, of Montreal, and Doss&#x27; solo project the Sunshine Fix were among the more notable Athens based groups. of Montreal frontperson Kevin Barnes said: &quot;The heyday, most of the late 1990s, everyone was involved in each others lives, and we would collaborate more, have dinners where everyone would make something.&quot; Schneider compares this period to the Summer of Love, and said the driving force for many of the bands was &quot;out-weirding [their] neighbor&quot; with their music. Elephant 6 bands would tour with each other, the larger bands allowed the smaller bands to open for them.

Denver was the smaller of the two hub cities. In addition to the Apples in Stereo, the major bands from Denver were the Minders, Dressy Bessy, and McIntyre&#x27;s solo project Von Hemmling. The main draw for Elephant 6 bands in Denver was Pet Sounds Studio, a recording studio Schneider built in McIntyre&#x27;s house. Many Elephant 6 albums were recorded at Pet Sounds, and were produced by Schneider. In addition to the two main hub cities, Elephant 6 bands began forming in various cities in the United States, such as the Essex Green and the Ladybug Transistor in Brooklyn, and Beulah in San Francisco.

===Inactivity===
In the early 2000s, Elephant 6 stagnated in activity. Neutral Milk Hotel member and the Gerbils frontman Scott Spillane identifies the sudden uptick of bands across the country as an important factor to this period. &quot;At the time the Elephant 6 thing was getting out of hand, and we started seeing all of these bands that had little Elephant 6 logos on them all over the place&quot; said Spillane. Bands began to tour more often, and the members had less time to interact with each other. Additionally, Neutral Milk Hotel and the Olivia Tremor Control went on hiatus. Mangum became reclusive as he struggled to cope with his newfound stardom, while the members of the Olivia Tremor Control wanted to record their own solo music.

Beulah member Pat Noel said many bands were dismayed at how journalists would &quot;pigeonhole&quot; them to the collective. &quot;We kind of made a conscious decision to distance ourselves a little bit from the whole thing.&quot; Schneider took a break from producing albums, and the final album to be affixed with the Elephant 6 Recording Company logo was &quot;Cul-De-Sacs and Dead Ends&quot; by the Minders in 1999. The collective slowly dissipated, although bands like the Apples in Stereo, Elf Power, and of Montreal continued making music throughout the 2000s.

===Brief reemergence===
The collective was relatively dormant until the release of &quot;New Magnetic Wonder&quot;, a 2007 album by the Apples in Stereo. &quot;New Magnetic Wonder&quot; featured all four of the collective&#x27;s originating members. While recording the album, they discussed new ideas, which in turn facilitated a need to make more music. The following year, Koster and Nesey Gallons organized the &quot;Elephant 6 Holiday Surprise Tour,&quot; a short concert tour that featured fifteen artists and ten Elephant 6 bands. Koster said &quot;Elephant 6 is back,&quot; and added: &quot;Somehow, everything&#x27;s happening for us now. I don&#x27;t know why we were ever interrupted, and why all this is happening now. But we&#x27;re all just so happy.&quot; The Olivia Tremor Control reunited in 2009, and Mangum returned to the public eye with solo concerts over the next few years.

On July 30, 2012, Doss died from a reported aneurysm. His death came as a shock to the collective, and stalled nearly all recordings at the time. Schneider said: &quot;I can&#x27;t say what it means for the Elephant 6 or the Apples ... On a musical level it&#x27;s too soon to say. I mean, I don&#x27;t want to say definitively that I don&#x27;t want to make music again, but on a musical level there&#x27;s no way to come to terms with the loss.&quot; The Olivia Tremor Control continued making music, and in 2017 Schneider confirmed he was producing unfinished recordings. Today, the Elephant 6 collective still exists, albeit on a much smaller scale. Bands like Elf Power and of Montreal continue to record music, and many bands have moved onto Elephant 6 offshoot labels such as Orange Twin Records and Cloud Recordings.

==Influences and style==
Elephant 6 bands explore a variety of music genres, including indie rock, synth-pop, and twee pop. A common interest for nearly every associated band, however, is psychedelic pop of the 1960s. Bands such as the Beach Boys, the Beatles, and the Zombies are important influences for Elephant 6 groups like the Apples in Stereo, Beulah, and the Olivia Tremor Control. Elephant 6&#x27;s de facto leader Robert Schneider notes the particular influence of the Beach Boys&#x27; unfinished album &quot;Smile&quot;, calling it the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; for many members of the collective. He notes how he and other members were obsessed with Beach Boys albums, and attempted to create the type of music they felt would have been included in &quot;Smile&quot;.

Most Elephant 6 members are anti-consumerism and possess a DIY ethic. Their music sometimes features intentionally low quality production, and bands may experiment with unique recording methods; for example, &quot;Music from the Unrealized Film Script: Dusk at Cubist Castle&quot; features recording techniques such as tape manipulation and sound collages. Schneider notes his hatred of both indie music and modern pop music, and said that his vision for Elephant 6 is a &quot;perfect pop world,&quot; untarnished by commercial interests.

==Impact==
Several journalists regard Elephant 6 as an important underground music movement, and a key contributor to the alternative rock and indie rock explosion in the 1990s. Lee M. Shook Jr. of &quot;Paste&quot; wrote: &quot;The Elephant 6 Recording Company would raise the bar for wide-scale countercultural activity and underground pop art—both musical, visual and otherwise—well into the 21st century.&quot; Tom Murphy of &quot;Westword&quot; expanded on this statement, by writing: &quot;It became a movement of sorts because the music was so accessible and inclusive of a wide range of musical expression, allowing for immediate and enduring growth, however loose the association.&quot;

The collective has influenced many indie rock bands, including Arcade Fire, Franz Ferdinand, and Tame Impala. Chris Chu of the Canadian band the Morning Benders said: &quot;Elephant 6 was the gateway for me. They seemed to be bridging that tradition from the 60s to a more modern, more indie approach. It was exactly what I was looking for, a new take on that stuff.&quot;

==Documentary==
In 2022 a documentary was released called &quot;A Future History Of: The Elephant 6 Recording Co.&quot; On Rotten Tomatoes the film currently has a 100% positive review rate.

==Associated acts==

The official Elephant 6 website lists forty-seven acts associated with the collective, although Shook Jr. reports there are more than fifty. Among the collective&#x27;s more notable acts include:

<doc id="10370" wikidata="Q194253" url="?curid=10370" title="Evangelicalism">
<text>Evangelicalism (), also called evangelical Christianity or evangelical Protestantism, is a worldwide interdenominational movement within Protestant Christianity that puts primary emphasis on evangelization. The word &quot;evangelical&quot; comes from the Greek word for &#x27;good news&#x27; (). The Gospel story of the salvation from sin is considered &quot;the good news&quot;. The process of personal conversion involves complete surrender to Jesus Christ (commonly referred to as being &quot;born again&quot;). The conversion process is authoritatively guided by the Bible Critics of the conceptualization of evangelicalism argue that it is too broad, too diverse, or too ill-defined to be adequately seen as a movement or a single movement.

The theological nature of evangelicalism was first explored during the Protestant Reformation in 16th century Europe. Martin Luther&#x27;s Ninety-Five Theses in 1517 emphasized that scripture and the preaching of the gospel had ultimate authority over the practices of the Church. The origins of modern evangelicalism are usually traced to 1738, with various theological streams contributing to its foundation, including Pietism and Radical Pietism, Puritanism, Quakerism and Moravianism (in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut). Preeminently, John Wesley and other early Methodists were at the root of sparking this new movement during the First Great Awakening. Today, evangelicals are found across many Protestant branches, as well as in various denominations around the world, not subsumed to a specific branch. Among leaders and major figures of the evangelical Protestant movement were Nicolaus Zinzendorf, George Fox, John Wesley, George Whitefield, Jonathan Edwards, Billy Graham, Bill Bright, Harold Ockenga, Gudina Tumsa, John Stott, Francisco Olazábal, William J. Seymour, and Martyn Lloyd-Jones. 

Evangelicalism has long had a presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries. The movement gained significant momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries with the Great Awakening in the United States, and also in Great Britain&#x27;s reformations.

 there were an estimated 619 million evangelicals in the world, meaning that one in four Christians would be classified as evangelical.
American evangelicals are a quarter of the nation&#x27;s population and its single largest religious group. As a transdenominational praxis, evangelicals may be found in nearly every Protestant denomination and tradition, particularly within the Reformed (Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, Congregational, Anglican Reformed, Baptist Reformed), Plymouth Brethren, Baptist, Methodist (Wesleyan–Arminian), Lutheran, Moravian, Free Church, Mennonite, Quaker, Pentecostal/charismatic and non-denominational churches.

==Terminology==
The word &quot;evangelical&quot; has its etymological roots in the Greek word for &#x27;gospel&#x27; or &#x27;good news&#x27;: , from &#x27;good&#x27;, the stem of, among other words, &#x27;messenger, angel&#x27;, and the neuter suffix . By the English Middle Ages, the term had expanded semantically to include not only the message, but also the New Testament which contained the message as well as more specifically the Gospels, which portray the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. The first published use of &quot;evangelical&quot; in English was in 1531, when William Tyndale wrote &quot;He exhorteth them to proceed constantly in the evangelical truth.&quot; One year later, Thomas More wrote the earliest recorded use in reference to a theological distinction when he spoke of &quot;Tyndale [and] his evangelical brother Barns.&quot;

During the Reformation, Protestant theologians embraced the term as referring to &quot;gospel truth.&quot; Martin Luther referred to the (&quot;evangelical church&quot;) to distinguish Protestants from Catholics in the Catholic Church. Into the 21st century, &quot;evangelical&quot; has continued in use as a synonym for Mainline Protestant in continental Europe. This usage is reflected in the names of Protestant denominations, such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The German term more accurately corresponds to the broad English term &quot;Protestant&quot; and should not be confused with the narrower German term , or the term (a term etymologically related to the Pietist and Radical Pietist movements), which are used to described Evangelicalism in the sense used in this article. Mainline Protestant denominations with a Lutheran or semi-Lutheran background, like the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of England, who are not evangelical in the sense but Protestant in the sense, have translated the German term (or Protestant) into the English term &quot;Evangelical&quot;, although the two German words have different meanings. In other parts of the world, especially in the English-speaking world, evangelical (German: or ) is commonly applied to describe the interdenominational Born-Again believing movement.

Christian historian David W. Bebbington writes that, &quot;Although &#x27;evangelical,&#x27; with a lower-case initial, is occasionally used to mean &#x27;of the gospel,&#x27; the term &#x27;Evangelical&#x27; with a capital letter, is applied to any aspect of the movement beginning in the 1730s.&quot; According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, &quot;evangelicalism&quot; was first used in 1831. In 1812, the term &quot;evangelicalism&quot; appeared in &quot;The History of Lynn&quot; by William Richards. In the summer of 1811 the term &quot;evangelicalists&quot; was used in &quot;The Sin and Danger of Schism&quot; by Rev. Dr. Andrew Burnaby, Archdeacon of Leicester.

The term may also be used outside any religious context to characterize a generic missionary, reforming, or redeeming impulse or purpose. For example, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; refers to &quot;the rise and fall of evangelical fervor within the Socialist movement.&quot; This usage refers to evangelism, rather than evangelicalism as discussed here; though sharing an etymology and conceptual basis, the words have diverged significantly in meaning.

==Beliefs==

One influential definition of evangelicalism has been proposed by historian David Bebbington. Bebbington notes four distinctive aspects of evangelical faith: conversionism, biblicism, crucicentrism, and activism, noting, &quot;Together they form a quadrilateral of priorities that is the basis of Evangelicalism.&quot;

Conversionism, or belief in the necessity of being &quot;born again,&quot; has been a constant theme of evangelicalism since its beginnings. To evangelicals, the central message of the gospel is justification by faith in Christ and repentance, or turning away, from sin. Conversion differentiates the Christian from the non-Christian, and the change in life it leads to is marked by both a rejection of sin and a corresponding personal holiness of life. A conversion experience can be emotional, including grief and sorrow for sin followed by great relief at receiving forgiveness. The stress on conversion differentiates evangelicalism from other forms of Protestantism by the associated belief that an assurance will accompany conversion. Among evangelicals, individuals have testified to both sudden and gradual conversions.

Biblicism is reverence for the Bible and high regard for biblical authority. All evangelicals believe in biblical inspiration, though they disagree over how this inspiration should be defined. Many evangelicals believe in biblical inerrancy, while other evangelicals believe in biblical infallibility.

Crucicentrism is the centrality that evangelicals give to the Atonement, the saving death and the resurrection of Jesus, that offers forgiveness of sins and new life. This is understood most commonly in terms of a substitutionary atonement, in which Christ died as a substitute for sinful humanity by taking on himself the guilt and punishment for sin.

Activism describes the tendency toward active expression and sharing of the gospel in diverse ways that include preaching and social action. This aspect of evangelicalism continues to be seen today in the proliferation of evangelical voluntary religious groups and parachurch organizations.

=== Church government and organizations ===
The word &quot;church&quot; has several meanings among evangelicals. It can refer to the universal church (the body of Christ) including all Christians everywhere. It can also refer to the church (congregation), which is the visible representation of the invisible church. It is responsible for teaching and administering the sacraments or ordinances (baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper, but some evangelicals also count footwashing as an ordinance as well).

Many evangelical traditions adhere to the doctrine of the believers&#x27; Church, which teaches that one becomes a member of the Church by the new birth and profession of faith. This originated in the Radical Reformation with Anabaptists but is held by denominations that practice believer&#x27;s baptism. Evangelicals in the Anglican, Methodist and Reformed traditions practice infant baptism as one&#x27;s initiation into the community of faith and the New Testament counterpart to circumcision, while also stressing the necessity of personal conversion later in life for salvation.

Some evangelical denominations operate according to episcopal polity or presbyterian polity. However, the most common form of church government within Evangelicalism is congregational polity. This is especially common among nondenominational evangelical churches. Many churches are members of a national and international denomination for a cooperative relationship in common organizations, for the mission and social areas, such as humanitarian aid, schools, theological institutes and hospitals. Common ministries within evangelical congregations are pastor, elder, deacon, evangelist and worship leader. The ministry of bishop with a function of supervision over churches on a regional or national scale is present in all the Evangelical Christian denominations, even if the titles president of the council or general overseer are mainly used for this function. The term bishop is explicitly used in certain denominations. Some evangelical denominations are members of the World Evangelical Alliance and its 129 national alliances.

Some evangelical denominations officially authorize the ordination of women in churches. The female ministry is justified by the fact that Mary Magdalene was chosen by Jesus to announce his resurrection to the apostles. The first Baptist woman who was consecrated pastor is the American Clarissa Danforth in the denomination Free Will Baptist in 1815. In 1882, in the American Baptist Churches USA. In the Assemblies of God of the United States, since 1927. In 1965, in the National Baptist Convention, USA. In 1969, in the Progressive National Baptist Convention. In 1975, in The Foursquare Church.

===Worship service===
For evangelicals, there are three interrelated meanings to the term &quot;worship&quot;. It can refer to living a &quot;God-pleasing and God-focused way of life,&quot; specific actions of praise to God, and a public worship service. Diversity characterizes evangelical worship practices. Liturgical, contemporary, charismatic and seeker-sensitive worship styles can all be found among evangelical churches. Overall, evangelicals tend to be more flexible and experimental with worship practices than mainline Protestant churches. It is usually run by a Christian pastor. A service is often divided into several parts, including congregational singing, a sermon, intercessory prayer, and other ministry. During worship there is usually a nursery for babies. Children and young people receive an adapted education, Sunday school, in a separate room.
Places of worship are usually called &quot;churches.&quot; In some megachurches, the building is called &quot;campus.&quot; The architecture of places of worship is mainly characterized by its sobriety. The Latin cross is one of the only spiritual symbols that can usually be seen on the building of an evangelical church and that identifies the place&#x27;s belonging.

Some services take place in theaters, schools or multipurpose rooms, rented for Sunday only. Because of their understanding of the second of the Ten Commandments, some evangelicals do not have religious material representations such as statues, icons, or paintings in their places of worship. There is usually a baptistery on what is variously known as the chancel (also called sanctuary) or stage, though they may be alternatively found in a separate room, for the baptisms by immersion.

In some countries of the world which apply sharia or communism, government authorizations for worship are complex for Evangelical Christians. Because of persecution of Christians, Evangelical house churches are the only option for many Christians to live their faith in community. For example, there is the Evangelical house churches in China movement. The meetings thus take place in private houses, in secret and in illegality.

The main Christian feasts celebrated by the Evangelicals are Christmas, Pentecost (by a majority of Evangelical denominations) and Easter for all believers.

===Education===

Evangelical churches have been involved in the establishment of elementary and secondary schools. It also enabled the development of several bible colleges, colleges and universities in the United States during the 19th century. Other evangelical universities have been established in various countries of the world.

The Council for Christian Colleges and Universities was founded in 1976. In 2023, the CCCU had 185 members in 21 countries.

The Association of Christian Schools International was founded in 1978 by 3 American associations of evangelical Christian schools. Various international schools have joined the network. In 2023, it had 23,000 schools in 100 countries.

The International Council for Evangelical Theological Education was founded in 1980 by the Theological Commission of the World Evangelical Alliance. In 2023, it had 850 member schools in 113 countries.

===Sexuality===

In matters of sexuality, there is a wide variety of thought among evangelicals and evangelical churches, but they tend to be conservative and prescriptive in general. Many evangelical churches promote the virginity pledge (abstinence pledge) among young evangelical Christians, who are invited to commit themselves, during a public ceremony, to sexual abstinence until Christian marriage. This pledge is often symbolized by a purity ring.

In some evangelical churches, young adults and unmarried couples are encouraged to marry early in order to live a sexuality according to the will of God.

A 2009 American study of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy reported that 80 percent of young, unmarried evangelicals have had sex and that 42 percent were in a relationship with sex, when surveyed.

The majority of evangelical Christian churches are against abortion and support adoption agencies and social support agencies for young mothers.

Masturbation is seen as forbidden by some evangelical pastors because of the sexual thoughts that may accompany it. However, evangelical pastors have pointed out that the practice has been erroneously associated with Onan by scholars, that it is not a sin if it is not practiced with fantasies or compulsively, and that it was useful in a married couple, if his or her partner did not have the same frequency of sexual needs.

Some evangelical churches speak only of sexual abstinence and do not speak of sexuality in marriage. Other evangelical churches speak of satisfying sexuality as a gift from God and a component of a Christian marriage harmonious, in messages during worship services or conferences. Many evangelical books and websites are specialized on the subject. The book &quot;The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love&quot; published in 1976 by Baptist pastor Tim LaHaye and his wife Beverly LaHaye was a pioneer in the field.

The perceptions of homosexuality in the Evangelical Churches are varied. They range from liberal to fundamentalist or moderate conservative and neutral. A 2011 Pew Research Center study found that 84 percent of evangelical leaders surveyed believed homosexuality should be discouraged. It is in the fundamentalist conservative positions that there are antigay activists on TV or radio who claim that homosexuality is the cause of many social problems, such as terrorism. Some churches have a conservative moderate position. Although they do not approve homosexual practices, they claim to show sympathy and respect for homosexuals. Some evangelical denominations have adopted neutral positions, leaving the choice to local churches to decide for same-sex marriage. There are some international evangelical denominations that are gay-friendly.

Christian marriage is presented by some churches as a protection against sexual misconduct and a compulsory step to obtain a position of responsibility in the church. This concept, however, has been challenged by numerous sex scandals involving married evangelical leaders. Finally, evangelical theologians recalled that celibacy should be more valued in the Church today, since the gift of celibacy was taught and lived by Jesus Christ and Paul of Tarsus.

=== Other views ===
For a majority of evangelical Christians, a belief in biblical inerrancy ensures that the miracles described in the Bible are still relevant and may be present in the life of the believer. Healings, academic or professional successes, the birth of a child after several attempts, the end of an addiction, etc., would be tangible examples of God&#x27;s intervention with the faith and prayer, by the Holy Spirit. In the 1980s, the neo-charismatic movement re-emphasized miracles and faith healing. In certain churches, a special place is thus reserved for faith healings with laying on of hands during worship services or for evangelization campaigns. Faith healing or divine healing is considered to be an inheritance of Jesus acquired by his death and resurrection. This view is typically ascribed to Pentecostal denominations, and not others that are cessationist (believing that miraculous gifts have ceased.)

In terms of denominational beliefs regarding science and the origin of the earth and human life, some evangelicals support young Earth creationism. For example, Answers in Genesis, founded in Australia in 1986, is an evangelical organization that seeks to defend the thesis. In 2007, they founded the Creation Museum in Petersburg, in Kentucky and in 2016 the Ark Encounter in Williamstown. Since the end of the 20th century, literalist creationism has been abandoned by some evangelicals in favor of intelligent design. For example, the think tank Discovery Institute, established in 1991 in Seattle, defends this thesis. Other evangelicals who accept the scientific consensus on evolution and the age of Earth believe in theistic evolution or evolutionary creation—the notion that God used the process of evolution to create life; a Christian organization that espouses this view is the BioLogos Foundation.

Pentecostal Evangelical Roma communities in Romania that have been evangelized by American missionaries, who mostly belong to Kalderash and Muchwaya Roma groups and once belonged to the Eastern Orthodox Christian Church, do not see the Muslim Roma (Xoraxane) as Roma and call them gypsies or simply muzzi, as long as they belong to Islam.

==Diversity==


The Reformed, Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostal, Churches of Christ, Plymouth Brethren, charismatic Protestant, and nondenominational Protestant traditions have all had strong influence within contemporary evangelicalism. Some Anabaptist denominations (such as the Brethren Church) are evangelical, and some Lutherans self-identify as evangelicals. There are also evangelical Anglicans and Quakers.

In the early 20th century, evangelical influence declined within mainline Protestantism and Christian fundamentalism developed as a distinct religious movement. Between 1950 and 2000 a mainstream evangelical consensus developed that sought to be more inclusive and more culturally relevant than fundamentalism while maintaining theologically conservative Protestant teaching. According to Brian Stanley, professor of world Christianity, this new postwar consensus is termed &quot;neoevangelicalism&quot;, the &quot;new evangelicalism&quot;, or simply &quot;evangelicalism&quot; in the United States, while in Great Britain and in other English-speaking countries, it is commonly termed &quot;conservative evangelicalism&quot;. Over the years, less conservative evangelicals have challenged this mainstream consensus to varying degrees. Such movements have been classified by a variety of labels, such as &quot;progressive&quot;, &quot;open&quot;, &quot;postconservative&quot;, and &quot;postevangelical&quot;.

Outside of self-consciously evangelical denominations, there is a broader &quot;evangelical streak&quot; in mainline Protestantism. Mainline Protestant churches predominantly have a liberal theology while evangelical churches predominantly have a fundamentalist or moderate conservative theology.

Some commentators have complained that Evangelicalism as a movement is too broad and its definition too vague to be of any practical value. Theologian Donald Dayton has called for a &quot;moratorium&quot; on use of the term. Historian D. G. Hart has also argued that &quot;evangelicalism needs to be relinquished as a religious identity because it does not exist&quot;.

===Christian fundamentalism===

Christian fundamentalism has been called a subset or &quot;subspecies&quot; of Evangelicalism. Fundamentalism regards biblical inerrancy, the virgin birth of Jesus, penal substitutionary atonement, the literal resurrection of Christ, and the Second Coming of Christ as fundamental Christian doctrines. 
Fundamentalism arose among evangelicals in the 1920s—primarily as an American phenomenon, but with counterparts in Britain and British Empire—to combat modernist or liberal theology in mainline Protestant churches. Failing to reform the mainline churches, fundamentalists separated from them and established their own churches, refusing to participate in ecumenical organizations (such as the National Council of Churches, founded in 1950), and making separatism (rigid separation from nonfundamentalist churches and their culture) a true test of faith. Most fundamentalists are Baptists and dispensationalist or Pentecostals and Charismatics.

Great emphasis is placed on the literal interpretation of the Bible as the primary method of Bible study as well as the biblical inerrancy and the infallibility of their interpretation.

===Mainstream varieties===

Mainstream evangelicalism is historically divided between two main orientations: confessionalism and revivalism. These two streams have been critical of each other. Confessional evangelicals have been suspicious of unguarded religious experience, while revivalist evangelicals have been critical of overly intellectual teaching that (they suspect) stifles vibrant spirituality. In an effort to broaden their appeal, many contemporary evangelical congregations intentionally avoid identifying with any single form of evangelicalism. These &quot;generic evangelicals&quot; are usually theologically and socially conservative, but their churches often present themselves as nondenominational (or, if a denominational member, strongly deemphasize its ties to such, such as a church name which excludes the denominational name) within the broader evangelical movement.

In the words of Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, confessional evangelicalism refers to &quot;that movement of Christian believers who seek a constant convictional continuity with the theological formulas of the Protestant Reformation&quot;. While approving of the evangelical distinctions proposed by Bebbington, confessional evangelicals believe that authentic evangelicalism requires more concrete definition in order to protect the movement from theological liberalism and from heresy. According to confessional evangelicals, subscription to the ecumenical creeds and to the Reformation-era confessions of faith (such as the confessions of the Reformed churches) provides such protection. Confessional evangelicals are represented by conservative Presbyterian churches (emphasizing the Westminster Confession), certain Baptist churches that emphasize historic Baptist confessions such as the Second London Confession, evangelical Anglicans who emphasize the Thirty-Nine Articles (such as in the Anglican Diocese of Sydney, Australia), Methodist churches that adhere to the Articles of Religion, and some confessional Lutherans with pietistic convictions.

The emphasis on historic Protestant orthodoxy among confessional evangelicals stands in direct contrast to an anticreedal outlook that has exerted its own influence on evangelicalism, particularly among churches strongly affected by revivalism and by pietism. Revivalist evangelicals are represented by some quarters of Methodism, the Wesleyan Holiness churches, the Pentecostal and charismatic churches, some Anabaptist churches, and some Baptists and Presbyterians. Revivalist evangelicals tend to place greater emphasis on religious experience than their confessional counterparts.

===Progressive evangelicals===
Evangelicals dissatisfied with the movement&#x27;s fundamentalism mainstream have been variously described as progressive evangelicals, postconservative evangelicals, open evangelicals and postevangelicals. Progressive evangelicals, also known as the evangelical left, share theological or social views with other progressive Christians while also identifying with evangelicalism. Progressive evangelicals commonly advocate for women&#x27;s equality, pacifism and social justice.

As described by Baptist theologian Roger E. Olson, postconservative evangelicalism is a theological school of thought that adheres to the four marks of evangelicalism, while being less rigid and more inclusive of other Christians. According to Olson, postconservatives believe that doctrinal truth is secondary to spiritual experience shaped by Scripture. Postconservative evangelicals seek greater dialogue with other Christian traditions and support the development of a multicultural evangelical theology that incorporates the voices of women, racial minorities, and Christians in the developing world. Some postconservative evangelicals also support open theism and the possibility of near universal salvation.

The term &quot;open evangelical&quot; refers to a particular Christian school of thought or churchmanship, primarily in Great Britain (especially in the Church of England). Open evangelicals describe their position as combining a traditional evangelical emphasis on the nature of scriptural authority, the teaching of the ecumenical creeds and other traditional doctrinal teachings, with an approach towards culture and other theological points-of-view which tends to be more inclusive than that taken by other evangelicals. Some open evangelicals aim to take a middle position between conservative and charismatic evangelicals, while others would combine conservative theological emphases with more liberal social positions.

British author Dave Tomlinson coined the phrase &quot;postevangelical&quot; to describe a movement comprising various trends of dissatisfaction among evangelicals. Others use the term with comparable intent, often to distinguish evangelicals in the emerging church movement from postevangelicals and antievangelicals. Tomlinson argues that &quot;linguistically, the distinction &quot;[between evangelical and postevangelical]&quot; resembles the one that sociologists make between the modern and postmodern eras&quot;.

==History==

===Background===
Modern evangelicalism emerged in the 18th century, first in Britain and its North American colonies. Nevertheless, there were earlier developments within the larger Protestant world that preceded and influenced the later evangelical revivals. According to religion scholar Randall Balmer, Evangelicalism resulted &quot;from the confluence of Pietism, Presbyterianism, and the vestiges of Puritanism. Evangelicalism picked up the peculiar characteristics from each strain – warmhearted spirituality from the Pietists (for instance), doctrinal precisionism from the Presbyterians, and individualistic introspection from the Puritans&quot;. Historian Mark Noll adds to this list High Church Anglicanism, which contributed to Evangelicalism a legacy of &quot;rigorous spirituality and innovative organization.&quot; Historian Rick Kennedy has identified New England Puritan clergyman Cotton Mather as the &quot;first American Evangelical&quot;.

During the 17th century, Pietism emerged in Europe as a movement for the revival of piety and devotion within the Lutheran church. As a protest against &quot;cold orthodoxy&quot; or against an overly formal and rational Christianity, Pietists advocated for an experiential religion that stressed high moral standards both for clergy and for lay people. The movement included both Christians who remained in the liturgical, state churches as well as separatist groups who rejected the use of baptismal fonts, altars, pulpits, and confessionals. As Radical Pietism spread, the movement&#x27;s ideals and aspirations influenced and were absorbed by evangelicals.

When George Fox, who is considered the founder of Quakerism, was eleven, he wrote that God spoke to him about &quot;keeping pure and being faithful to God and man.&quot; After being troubled when his friends asked him to drink alcohol with them at the age of nineteen, Fox spent the night in prayer and soon afterwards he left his home in a four year search for spiritual satisfaction. In his &quot;Journal&quot;, at age 23, he believed that he &quot;found through faith in Jesus Christ the full assurance of salvation.&quot; Fox began to spread his message and his emphasis on &quot;the necessity of an inward transformation of heart&quot;, as well as the possibility of Christian perfection, drew opposition from English clergy and laity. In the mid-1600s, many people became attracted to Fox&#x27;s preaching and his followers became known as the Religious Society of Friends. By 1660, the Quakers grew to 35,000, and while the two movements are distinct and have important differences like the doctrine of the Inward Light, they are considered by some to be among the first in the evangelical Christian movement.

The Presbyterian heritage not only gave Evangelicalism a commitment to Protestant orthodoxy but also contributed a revival tradition that stretched back to the 1620s in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Central to this tradition was the communion season, which normally occurred in the summer months. For Presbyterians, celebrations of Holy Communion were infrequent but popular events preceded by several Sundays of preparatory preaching and accompanied with preaching, singing, and prayers.

Puritanism combined Calvinism with a doctrine that conversion was a prerequisite for church membership and with an emphasis on the study of Scripture by lay people. It took root in the colonies of New England, where the Congregational church became an established religion. There the Half-Way Covenant of 1662 allowed parents who had not testified to a conversion experience to have their children baptized, while reserving Holy Communion for converted church members alone. By the 18th century Puritanism was in decline and many ministers expressed alarm at the loss of religious piety. This concern over declining religious commitment led many people to support evangelical revival.

High-Church Anglicanism also exerted influence on early Evangelicalism. High Churchmen were distinguished by their desire to adhere to primitive Christianity. This desire included imitating the faith and ascetic practices of early Christians as well as regularly partaking of Holy Communion. High Churchmen were also enthusiastic organizers of voluntary religious societies. Two of the most prominent were the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (founded in London in 1698), which distributed Bibles and other literature and built schools, and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, which was founded in England in 1701 to facilitate missionary work in British colonies (especially among colonists in North America). Samuel and Susanna Wesley, the parents of John and Charles Wesley (born 1703 and 1707 respectively), were both devoted advocates of High-Church ideas.

===18th century===

In the 1730s, Evangelicalism emerged as a distinct phenomenon out of religious revivals that began in Britain and New England. While religious revivals had occurred within Protestant churches in the past, the evangelical revivals that marked the 18th century were more intense and radical. Evangelical revivalism imbued ordinary men and women with a confidence and enthusiasm for sharing the gospel and converting others outside of the control of established churches, a key discontinuity with the Protestantism of the previous era.

It was developments in the doctrine of assurance that differentiated Evangelicalism from what went before. Bebbington says, &quot;The dynamism of the Evangelical movement was possible only because its adherents were assured in their faith.&quot; He goes on:

The first local revival occurred in Northampton, Massachusetts, under the leadership of Congregationalist minister Jonathan Edwards. In the fall of 1734, Edwards preached a sermon series on &quot;Justification By Faith Alone&quot;, and the community&#x27;s response was extraordinary. Signs of religious commitment among the laity increased, especially among the town&#x27;s young people. The revival ultimately spread to 25 communities in western Massachusetts and central Connecticut until it began to wane by the spring of 1735. Edwards was heavily influenced by Pietism, so much so that one historian has stressed his &quot;American Pietism&quot;. One practice clearly copied from European Pietists was the use of small groups divided by age and gender, which met in private homes to conserve and promote the fruits of revival.

At the same time, students at Yale University (at that time Yale College) in New Haven, Connecticut, were also experiencing revival. Among them was Aaron Burr Sr., who would become a prominent Presbyterian minister and future president of Princeton University. In New Jersey, Gilbert Tennent, another Presbyterian minister, was preaching the evangelical message and urging the Presbyterian Church to stress the necessity of converted ministers.

The spring of 1735 also marked important events in England and Wales. Howell Harris, a Welsh schoolteacher, had a conversion experience on May 25 during a communion service. He described receiving assurance of God&#x27;s grace after a period of fasting, self-examination, and despair over his sins. Sometime later, Daniel Rowland, the Anglican curate of Llangeitho, Wales, experienced conversion as well. Both men began preaching the evangelical message to large audiences, becoming leaders of the Welsh Methodist revival. At about the same time that Harris experienced conversion in Wales, George Whitefield was converted at Oxford University after his own prolonged spiritual crisis. Whitefield later remarked, &quot;About this time God was pleased to enlighten my soul and bring me into the knowledge of His free grace, and the necessity of being justified in His sight by &quot;faith only.&quot;&quot;

Whitefield&#x27;s fellow Holy Club member and spiritual mentor, Charles Wesley, reported an evangelical conversion in 1738. In the same week, Charles&#x27; brother and future founder of Methodism, John Wesley was also converted after a long period of inward struggle. During this spiritual crisis, John Wesley was directly influenced by Pietism. Two years before his conversion, Wesley had traveled to the newly established colony of Georgia as a missionary for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. He shared his voyage with a group of Moravian Brethren led by August Gottlieb Spangenberg. The Moravians&#x27; faith and piety deeply impressed Wesley, especially their belief that it was a normal part of Christian life to have an assurance of one&#x27;s salvation. Wesley recounted the following exchange with Spangenberg on February 7, 1736:

Wesley finally received the assurance he had been searching for at a meeting of a religious society in London. While listening to a reading from Martin Luther&#x27;s preface to the Epistle to the Romans, Wesley felt spiritually transformed:

Pietism continued to influence Wesley, who had translated 33 Pietist hymns from German to English. Numerous German Pietist hymns became part of the English Evangelical repertoire. By 1737, Whitefield had become a national celebrity in England where his preaching drew large crowds, especially in London where the Fetter Lane Society had become a center of evangelical activity. Whitfield joined forces with Edwards to &quot;fan the flame of revival&quot; in the Thirteen Colonies in 1739–40. Soon the First Great Awakening stirred Protestants throughout America.

Evangelical preachers emphasized personal salvation and piety more than ritual and tradition. Pamphlets and printed sermons crisscrossed the Atlantic, encouraging the revivalists. The Awakening resulted from powerful preaching that gave listeners a sense of deep personal revelation of their need of salvation by Jesus Christ. Pulling away from ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made Christianity intensely personal to the average person by fostering a deep sense of spiritual conviction and redemption, and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to a new standard of personal morality. It reached people who were already church members. It changed their rituals, their piety and their self-awareness. To the evangelical imperatives of Reformation Protestantism, 18th century American Christians added emphases on divine outpourings of the Holy Spirit and conversions that implanted within new believers an intense love for God. Revivals encapsulated those hallmarks and forwarded the newly created Evangelicalism into the early republic.

By the 1790s, the Evangelical party in the Church of England remained a small minority but were not without influence. John Newton and Joseph Milner were influential evangelical clerics. Evangelical clergy networked together through societies such as the Eclectic Society in London and the Elland Society in Yorkshire. The Old Dissenter denominations (the Baptists, Congregationalists and Quakers) were falling under evangelical influence, with the Baptists most affected and Quakers the least. Evangelical ministers dissatisfied with both Anglicanism and Methodism often chose to work within these churches. In the 1790s, all of these evangelical groups, including the Anglicans, were Calvinist in orientation.

Methodism (the &quot;New Dissent&quot;) was the most visible expression of evangelicalism by the end of the 18th century. The Wesleyan Methodists boasted around 70,000 members throughout the British Isles, in addition to the Calvinistic Methodists in Wales and the Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s Connexion, which was organized under George Whitefield&#x27;s influence. The Wesleyan Methodists, however, were still nominally affiliated with the Church of England and would not completely separate until 1795, four years after Wesley&#x27;s death. The Wesleyan Methodist Church&#x27;s Arminianism distinguished it from the other evangelical groups.

At the same time, evangelicals were an important faction within the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. Influential ministers included John Erskine, Henry Wellwood Moncrieff and Stevenson Macgill. The church&#x27;s General Assembly, however, was controlled by the Moderate Party, and evangelicals were involved in the First and Second Secessions from the national church during the 18th century.

===19th century===
The start of the 19th century saw an increase in missionary work and many of the major missionary societies were founded around this time (see Timeline of Christian missions). Both the Evangelical and high church movements sponsored missionaries.

The Second Great Awakening (which actually began in 1790) was primarily an American revivalist movement and resulted in substantial growth of the Methodist and Baptist churches. Charles Grandison Finney was an important preacher of this period.

In Britain in addition to stressing the traditional Wesleyan combination of &quot;Bible, cross, conversion, and activism&quot;, the revivalist movement sought a universal appeal, hoping to include rich and poor, urban and rural, and men and women. Special efforts were made to attract children and to generate literature to spread the revivalist message.

&quot;Christian conscience&quot; was used by the British Evangelical movement to promote social activism. Evangelicals believed activism in government and the social sphere was an essential method in reaching the goal of eliminating sin in a world drenched in wickedness. The Evangelicals in the Clapham Sect included figures such as William Wilberforce who successfully campaigned for the abolition of slavery.

In the late 19th century, the revivalist Wesleyan-Holiness movement based on John Wesley&#x27;s doctrine of &quot;entire sanctification&quot; came to the forefront, and while many adherents remained within mainline Methodism, others established new denominations, such as the Free Methodist Church and Wesleyan Methodist Church. In urban Britain the Holiness message was less exclusive and censorious.

Keswickianism taught the doctrine of the second blessing in non-Methodist circles and came to influence evangelicals of the Calvinistic (Reformed) tradition, leading to the establishment of denominations such as the Christian and Missionary Alliance.

John Nelson Darby of the Plymouth Brethren was a 19th-century Irish Anglican minister who devised modern dispensationalism, an innovative Protestant theological interpretation of the Bible that was incorporated in the development of modern Evangelicalism. Cyrus Scofield further promoted the influence of dispensationalism through the explanatory notes to his Scofield Reference Bible. According to scholar Mark S. Sweetnam, who takes a cultural studies perspective, dispensationalism can be defined in terms of its Evangelicalism, its insistence on the literal interpretation of Scripture, its recognition of stages in God&#x27;s dealings with humanity, its expectation of the imminent return of Christ to rapture His saints, and its focus on both apocalypticism and premillennialism.

During the 19th century, the megachurches, churches with more than 2,000 people, began to develop. The first evangelical megachurch, the Metropolitan Tabernacle with a 6000-seat auditorium, was inaugurated in 1861 in London by Charles Spurgeon. Dwight L. Moody founded the Illinois Street Church in Chicago.

An advanced theological perspective came from the Princeton theologians from the 1850s to the 1920s, such as Charles Hodge, Archibald Alexander and B. B. Warfield.

===20th century===
After 1910 the Fundamentalist movement dominated Evangelicalism in the early part of the 20th century; the Fundamentalists rejected liberal theology and emphasized the inerrancy of the Scriptures.

Following the 1904–1905 Welsh revival, the Azusa Street Revival in 1906 began the spread of Pentecostalism in North America.

The 20th century also marked by the emergence of the televangelism. Aimee Semple McPherson, who founded the megachurch &quot;Angelus Temple&quot; in Los Angeles, used radio in the 1920s to reach a wider audience.

After the Scopes trial in 1925, &quot;Christian Century&quot; wrote of &quot;Vanishing Fundamentalism&quot;. In 1929 Princeton University, once the bastion of conservative theology, added several modernists to its faculty, resulting in the departure of J. Gresham Machen and a split in the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.

Evangelicalism began to reassert itself in the second half of the 1930s. One factor was the advent of the radio as a means of mass communication. When Charles E. Fuller] began his &quot;Old Fashioned Revival Hour&quot; on October 3, 1937, he sought to avoid the contentious issues that had caused fundamentalists to be characterized as narrow.

One hundred forty-seven representatives from thirty-four denominations met from April 7 through 9, 1942, in St. Louis, Missouri, for a &quot;National Conference for United Action among Evangelicals.&quot; The next year six hundred representatives in Chicago established the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) with Harold Ockenga as its first president. The NAE was partly a reaction to the founding of the American Council of Christian Churches (ACCC) under the leadership of the fundamentalist Carl McIntire. The ACCC in turn had been founded to counter the influence of the Federal Council of Churches (later merged into the National Council of Churches), which fundamentalists saw as increasingly embracing modernism in its ecumenism. Those who established the NAE had come to view the name fundamentalist as &quot;an embarrassment instead of a badge of honor.&quot;

Evangelical revivalist radio preachers organized themselves in the National Religious Broadcasters in 1944 in order to regulate their activity. With the founding of the NAE, American Protestantism was divided into three large groups—the fundamentalists, the modernists, and the new evangelicals, who sought to position themselves between the other two.

In 1947, Harold Ockenga coined the term neo-evangelicalism to identify a movement distinct from fundamentalism. The neo-evangelicals had three broad characteristics that distinguished them from the conservative fundamentalism of the ACCC:

Each of these characteristics took concrete shape by the mid-1950s. In 1947 Carl F. H. Henry&#x27;s book &quot;The Uneasy Conscience of Fundamentalism&quot; called on evangelicals to engage in addressing social concerns:

In the same year Fuller Theological Seminary was established with Ockenga as its president and Henry as the head of its theology department.

The strongest impetus, however, was the development of the work of Billy Graham. In 1951, with producer Dick Ross, he founded the film production company World Wide Pictures. Graham had begun his career with the support of McIntire and fellow conservatives Bob Jones Sr. and John R. Rice. However, in broadening the reach of his London crusade of 1954, he accepted the support of denominations that those men disapproved of. When he went even further in his 1957 New York crusade, conservatives strongly condemned him and withdrew their support. According to William Martin:

A fourth development—the founding of &quot;Christianity Today&quot; (&quot;CT&quot;) with Henry as its first editor—was strategic in giving neo-evangelicals a platform to promote their views and in positioning them between the fundamentalists and modernists. In a letter to Harold Lindsell, Graham said that &quot;CT&quot; would:

The postwar period also saw growth of the ecumenical movement and the founding of the World Council of Churches, which the Evangelical community generally regarded with suspicion.

In the United Kingdom, John Stott (1921–2011) and Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1899–1981) emerged as key leaders in Evangelical Christianity.

The charismatic movement began in the 1960s and resulted in the introduction of Pentecostal theology and practice into many mainline denominations. New charismatic groups such as the Association of Vineyard Churches and Newfrontiers trace their roots to this period (see also British New Church Movement).

The closing years of the 20th century saw controversial postmodern influences entering some parts of Evangelicalism, particularly with the emerging church movement. Also controversial is the relationship between spiritualism and contemporary military metaphors and practices animating many branches of Christianity but especially relevant in the sphere of Evangelicalism. Spiritual warfare is the latest iteration in a long-standing partnership between religious organization and militarization, two spheres that are rarely considered together, although aggressive forms of prayer have long been used to further the aims of expanding Evangelical influence. Major moments of increased political militarization have occurred concurrently with the growth of prominence of militaristic imagery in evangelical communities. This paradigmatic language, paired with an increasing reliance on sociological and academic research to bolster militarized sensibility, serves to illustrate the violent ethos that effectively underscores militarized forms of evangelical prayer.
==Global statistics==

According to a 2011 Pew Forum study on global Christianity, 285,480,000 or 13.1 percent of all Christians are Evangelicals. These figures do not include the Pentecostalism and Charismatic movements. The study states that the category &quot;Evangelicals&quot; should not be considered as a separate category of &quot;Pentecostal and Charismatic&quot; categories, since some believers consider themselves in both movements where their church is affiliated with an Evangelical association.

In 2015, the World Evangelical Alliance is &quot;a network of churches in 129 nations that have each formed an Evangelical alliance and over 100 international organizations joining together to give a world-wide identity, voice, and platform to more than 600 million Evangelical Christians&quot;. The Alliance was formed in 1951 by Evangelicals from 21 countries. It has worked to support its members to work together globally.

According to Sébastien Fath of CNRS, in 2016, there are 619 million Evangelicals in the world, one in four Christians. In 2017, about 630 million, an increase of 11 million, including Pentecostals.

Operation World estimates the number of Evangelicals at 545.9 million, which makes for 7.9 percent of the world&#x27;s population. From 1960 to 2000, the global growth of the number of reported Evangelicals grew three times the world&#x27;s population rate, and twice that of Islam. According to Operation World, the Evangelical population&#x27;s current annual growth rate is 2.6 percent, still more than twice the world&#x27;s population growth rate.

===Africa===
In the 21st century, there are Evangelical churches active in many African countries. They have grown especially since independence came in the 1960s, the strongest movements are based on Pentecostal beliefs. There is a wide range of theology and organizations, including some international movements.

==== Nigeria ====

In Nigeria the Evangelical Church Winning All (formerly &quot;Evangelical Church of West Africa&quot;) is the largest church organization with five thousand congregations and over ten million members. It sponsors three seminaries and eight Bible colleges, and 1600 missionaries who serve in Nigeria and other countries with the Evangelical Missionary Society (EMS). There have been serious confrontations since 1999 between Muslims and Christians standing in opposition to the expansion of Sharia law in northern Nigeria. The confrontation has radicalized and politicized the Christians. Violence has been escalating.

==== Ethiopia and Eritrea ====
In Ethiopia, Eritrea, and the Ethiopian and Eritrean diaspora, P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay (from Ge&#x27;ez: ጴንጤ), also known as Ethiopian–Eritrean Evangelicalism, or Wenigēlawī (from Ge&#x27;ez: ወንጌላዊ – which directly translates to &quot;Evangelical&quot;) are terms used for Evangelical Christians and other Eastern/Oriental-oriented Protestant Christians within Ethiopia and Eritrea, and the Ethiopian and Eritrean diaspora abroad. Prominent movements among them have been Pentecostalism (Ethiopian Full Gospel Believers&#x27; Church), the Baptist tradition (Ethiopian Kale Heywet Church), Lutheranism (Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus and Evangelical Lutheran Church of Eritrea), and the Mennonite-Anabaptist tradition (Meserete Kristos Church).

==== Kenya ====
In Kenya, mainstream Evangelical denominations have taken the lead in promoting political activism and backers, with the smaller Evangelical sects of less importance. Daniel arap Moi was president 1978 to 2002 and claimed to be an Evangelical; he proved intolerant of dissent or pluralism or decentralization of power.

==== South Africa ====

The Berlin Missionary Society (BMS) was one of four German Protestant mission societies active in South Africa before 1914. It emerged from the German tradition of Pietism after 1815 and sent its first missionaries to South Africa in 1834. There were few positive reports in the early years, but it was especially active 1859–1914. It was especially strong in the Boer republics. The World War cut off contact with Germany, but the missions continued at a reduced pace. After 1945 the missionaries had to deal with decolonization across Africa and especially with the apartheid government. At all times the BMS emphasized spiritual inwardness, and values such as morality, hard work and self-discipline. It proved unable to speak and act decisively against injustice and racial discrimination and was disbanded in 1972.

==== Malawi ====
Since 1974, young professionals have been the active proselytizers of Evangelicalism in the cities of Malawi.

==== Mozambique ====
In Mozambique, Evangelical Protestant Christianity emerged around 1900 from black migrants whose converted previously in South Africa. They were assisted by European missionaries, but, as industrial workers, they paid for their own churches and proselytizing. They prepared southern Mozambique for the spread of Evangelical Protestantism. During its time as a colonial power in Mozambique, the Catholic Portuguese government tried to counter the spread of Evangelical Protestantism.

====East African Revival====

The East African Revival was a renewal movement within Evangelical churches in East Africa during the late 1920s and 1930s that began at a Church Missionary Society mission station in the Belgian territory of Ruanda-Urundi in 1929, and spread to: Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya during the 1930s and 1940s contributing to the significant growth of the church in East Africa through the 1970s and had a visible influence on Western missionaries who were observer-participants of the movement.

===Latin America===
In modern Latin America, the term &quot;Evangelical&quot; is often simply a synonym for &quot;Protestant&quot;.

====Brazil====
Protestantism in Brazil largely originated with German immigrants and British and American missionaries in the 19th century, following up on efforts that began in the 1820s.

In the late nineteenth century, while the vast majority of Brazilians were nominal Catholics, the nation was underserved by priests, and for large numbers their religion was only nominal. The Catholic Church in Brazil was de-established in 1890, and responded by increasing the number of dioceses and the efficiency of its clergy. Many Protestants came from a large German immigrant community, but they were seldom engaged in proselytism and grew mostly by natural increase.

Methodists were active along with Presbyterians and Baptists. The Scottish missionary Robert Reid Kalley, with support from the Free Church of Scotland, moved to Brazil in 1855, founding the first Evangelical church among the Portuguese-speaking population there in 1856. It was organized according to the Congregational policy as the Igreja Evangélica Fluminense; it became the mother church of Congregationalism in Brazil. The Seventh-day Adventists arrived in 1894, and the YMCA was organized in 1896. The missionaries promoted schools colleges and seminaries, including a liberal arts college in São Paulo, later known as Mackenzie, and an agricultural school in Lavras. The Presbyterian schools in particular later became the nucleus of the governmental system. In 1887 Protestants in Rio de Janeiro formed a hospital. The missionaries largely reached a working-class audience, as the Brazilian upper-class was wedded either to Catholicism or to secularism. By 1914, Protestant churches founded by American missionaries had 47,000 communicants, served by 282 missionaries. In general, these missionaries were more successful than they had been in Mexico, Argentina or elsewhere in Latin America.

There were 700,000 Protestants by 1930, and increasingly they were in charge of their own affairs. In 1930, the Methodist Church of Brazil became independent of the missionary societies and elected its own bishop. Protestants were largely from a working-class, but their religious networks help speed their upward social mobility.

Protestants accounted for fewer than 5 percent of the population until the 1960s but grew exponentially by proselytizing and by 2000 made up over 15 percent of Brazilians affiliated with a church. Pentecostals and charismatic groups account for the vast majority of this expansion.

Pentecostal missionaries arrived early in the 20th century. Pentecostal conversions surged during the 1950s and 1960s, when native Brazilians began founding autonomous churches. The most influential included Brasil Para o Cristo (Brazil for Christ), founded in 1955 by Manoel de Mello. With an emphasis on personal salvation, on God&#x27;s healing power, and on strict moral codes these groups have developed broad appeal, particularly among the booming urban migrant communities. In Brazil, since the mid-1990s, groups committed to uniting black identity, antiracism, and Evangelical theology have rapidly proliferated. Pentecostalism arrived in Brazil with Swedish and American missionaries in 1911. it grew rapidly but endured numerous schisms and splits. In some areas the Evangelical Assemblies of God churches have taken a leadership role in politics since the 1960s. They claimed major credit for the election of Fernando Collor de Mello as president of Brazil in 1990.

According to the 2000 census, 15.4 percent of the Brazilian population was Protestant. Recent research conducted by the Datafolha institute shows that 25 percent of Brazilians are Protestants, of which 19 percent are followers of Pentecostal denominations. The 2010 census found out that 22.2 percent were Protestant at that date. Protestant denominations saw a rapid growth in their number of followers since the last decades of the 20th century. They are politically and socially conservative, and emphasize that God&#x27;s favor translates into business success. The rich and the poor remained traditional Catholics, while most Evangelical Protestants were in the new lower-middle class – known as the &quot;C class&quot; (in a A–E classification system).

Chesnut argues that Pentecostalism has become &quot;one of the principal organizations of the poor&quot;, for these churches provide the sort of social network that teach members the skills they need to thrive in a rapidly developing meritocratic society.

One large Evangelical church that originated from Brazil is the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God (IURD), a neo‐Pentecostal denomination begun in 1977. It now has a presence in many countries, and claims millions of members worldwide.

====Guatemala====

Protestants remained a small portion of the population until the late-twentieth century, when various Protestant groups experienced a demographic boom that coincided with the increasing violence of the Guatemalan Civil War. Two former Guatemalan heads of state, General Efraín Ríos Montt and Jorge Serrano Elías have been practicing Evangelical Protestants, as is Guatemala&#x27;s former President, Jimmy Morales. General Montt, an Evangelical from the Pentecostal tradition, came to power through a coup. He escalated the war against leftist guerrilla insurgents as a holy war against atheistic &quot;forces of evil&quot;.

===Asia===
==== China ====

Evangelical Christianity came to China through Protestant missionaries in the 19th century. Starting in 1907, with the Manchurian Revival, evangelicalism grew through native preachers with homegrown traditions.

Counting the number of Christians in China presents numerous difficulties. French researcher Sebastian Fath has estimated that there are 66 million evangelicals in mainland China as of 2020. Showing the issues in counting, a 2023 survey showed only a total of 18 million Protestant adults.

====South Korea====
Protestant missionary activity in Asia was most successful in Korea. American Presbyterians and Methodists arrived in the 1880s and were well received. Between 1910 and 1945, when Korea was a Japanese colony, Christianity became in part an expression of nationalism in opposition to Japan&#x27;s efforts to enforce the Japanese language and the Shinto religion. In 1914, out of 16 million people, there were 86,000 Protestants and 79,000 Catholics; by 1934, the numbers were 168,000 and 147,000. Presbyterian missionaries were especially successful. Since the Korean War (1950–53), many Korean Christians have migrated to the U.S., while those who remained behind have risen sharply in social and economic status. Most Korean Protestant churches in the 21st century emphasize their Evangelical heritage. Korean Evangelicalism is characterized by theological conservatism coupled with an emotional revivalist style. Most churches sponsor revival meetings once or twice a year. Missionary work is a high priority, with 13,000 men and women serving in missions across the world, putting Korea in second place just behind the US.

Sukman argues that since 1945, Protestantism has been widely seen by Koreans as the religion of the middle class, youth, intellectuals, urbanites, and modernists. It has been a powerful force supporting South Korea&#x27;s pursuit of modernity and emulation of the United States, and opposition to the old Japanese colonialism and to the authoritarianism of North Korea.

South Korea has been referred as an &quot;evangelical superpower&quot; for being the home to some of the largest and most dynamic Christian churches in the world; South Korea is also second to the U.S. in the number of missionaries sent abroad.

According to 2015 South Korean census, 9.7 million or 19.7 percent of the population described themselves as Protestants, many of whom belong to Presbyterian churches shaped by Evangelicalism.

==== Philippines ====

According to the 2010 census, 2.68 percent of Filipinos are Evangelicals. The Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches (PCEC), an organization of more than seventy Evangelical and Mainline Protestant churches, and more than 210 para-church organizations in the Philippines, counts more than 11 million members as of 2011.

===Europe===
====France====

In 2019, it was reported that Evangelicalism in France was growing, and a new Evangelical church was built every 10 days and now counts 700,000 followers across France.

====Great Britain====

John Wesley (1703–1791) was an Anglican cleric and theologian who, with his brother Charles Wesley (1707–1788) and fellow cleric George Whitefield (1714–1770), founded Methodism. After 1791 the movement became independent of the Anglican Church as the &quot;Methodist Connection&quot;. It became a force in its own right, especially among the working class.

The &quot;Clapham Sect&quot; was a group of Church of England evangelicals and social reformers based in Clapham, London; they were active 1780s–1840s). John Newton (1725–1807) was the founder. They are described by the historian Stephen Tomkins as &quot;a network of friends and families in England, with William Wilberforce as its center of gravity, who were powerfully bound together by their shared moral and spiritual values, by their religious mission and social activism, by their love for each other, and by marriage&quot;.

Evangelicalism was a major force in the Anglican Church from about 1800 to the 1860s. By 1848 when an evangelical John Bird Sumner became Archbishop of Canterbury, between a quarter and a third of all Anglican clergy were linked to the movement, which by then had diversified greatly in its goals and they were no longer considered an organized faction.

In the 21st century there are an estimated 2 million Evangelicals in the UK. According to research performed by the Evangelical Alliance in 2013, 87 percent of UK evangelicals attend Sunday morning church services every week and 63 percent attend weekly or fortnightly small groups. An earlier survey conducted in 2012 found that 92 percent of evangelicals agree it is a Christian&#x27;s duty to help those in poverty and 45 percent attend a church which has a fund or scheme that helps people in immediate need, and 42 percent go to a church that supports or runs a foodbank. 63 percent believe in tithing, and so give around 10 percent of their income to their church, Christian organizations and various charities 83 percent of UK evangelicals believe that the Bible has supreme authority in guiding their beliefs, views and behavior and 52 percent read or listen to the Bible daily. The Evangelical Alliance, formed in 1846, was the first ecumenical evangelical body in the world and works to unite evangelicals, helping them listen to, and be heard by, the government, media and society.

====Switzerland====

Since the 1970s, the number of Evangelicals and Evangelical congregations has grown strongly in Switzerland. Population censuses suggest that these congregations saw the number of their members triple from 1970 to 2000, qualified as a &quot;spectacular development&quot; by specialists. Sociologists Jörg Stolz and Olivier Favre show that the growth is due to charismatic and Pentecostal groups, while classical evangelical groups are stable and fundamentalist groups are in decline. A quantitative national census on religious congregations reveals the important diversity of evangelicalism in Switzerland.

=== Anglo America ===

==== United States ====

By the late 19th to early 20th century, most American Protestants were Evangelicals. A bitter divide had arisen between the more liberal-modernist mainline denominations and the fundamentalist denominations, the latter typically consisting of Evangelicals. Key issues included the truth of the Bible—literal or figurative, and teaching of evolution in the schools.

During and after World War II, Evangelicals became increasingly organized. There was a great expansion of Evangelical activity within the United States, &quot;a revival of revivalism&quot;. Youth for Christ was formed; it later became the base for Billy Graham&#x27;s revivals. The National Association of Evangelicals formed in 1942 as a counterpoise to the mainline Federal Council of Churches. In 1942–43, the Old-Fashioned Revival Hour had a record-setting national radio audience. With this organization, though, fundamentalist groups separated from Evangelicals.

According to a Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life study, Evangelicals can be broadly divided into three camps: traditionalist, centrist, and modernist. A 2004 Pew survey identified that while 70.4 percent of Americans call themselves &quot;Christian&quot;, Evangelicals only make up 26.3 percent of the population, while Catholics make up 22 percent and mainline Protestants make up 16 percent. Among the Christian population in 2020, mainline Protestants began to outnumber Evangelicals.

Evangelicals have been socially active throughout US history, a tradition dating back to the abolitionist movement of the Antebellum period and the prohibition movement. As a group, evangelicals are most often associated with the Christian right. However, a large number of black self-labeled Evangelicals, and a small proportion of liberal white self-labeled Evangelicals, gravitate towards the Christian left.

Recurrent themes within American Evangelical discourse include abortion, evolution denial, secularism, and the notion of the United States as a Christian nation.

== Evangelical humanitarian aid ==

In the 1940s, in the United States, neo-evangelicalism developed the importance of social justice and Christian humanitarian aid actions in Evangelical churches. The majority of evangelical Christian humanitarian organizations were founded in the second half of the 20th century. Among those with the most partner countries, there was the foundation of World Vision International (1950), Samaritan&#x27;s Purse (1970), Mercy Ships (1978), Prison Fellowship International (1979), International Justice Mission (1997).

<doc id="10371" wikidata="Q495529" url="?curid=10371" title="Euphonium">
<text>The euphonium is a medium-sized, 3- or 4-valve, often compensating, conical-bore, tenor-voiced brass instrument that derives its name from the Ancient Greek word &quot;euphōnos&quot;, meaning &quot;well-sounding&quot; or &quot;sweet-voiced&quot; ( &quot;eu&quot; means &quot;well&quot; or &quot;good&quot; and &quot;phōnē&quot; means &quot;sound&quot;, hence &quot;of good sound&quot;). The euphonium is a valved instrument. Nearly all current models have piston valves, though some models with rotary valves do exist.

Euphonium music may be notated in the bass clef as a non-transposing instrument or in the treble clef as a transposing instrument in B. In British brass bands, it is typically treated as a treble-clef instrument, while in American band music, parts may be written in either treble clef or bass clef, or both.

A person who plays the euphonium is known as a euphoniumist, a euphonist, a euphophonist or simply a euphonium player.

== Name ==
The euphonium is in the family of brass instruments, more particularly low-brass instruments with many relatives. It is extremely similar to a baritone horn. The difference is that the conical bore size of the baritone horn is typically smaller than that of the euphonium. It is controversial whether this is sufficient to make them two different instruments. In the trombone family large and small bore trombones are both called trombones, while the cylindrical trumpet and the conical flugelhorn are given different names. As with the trumpet and flugelhorn, the two instruments are easily doubled by one player, with some modification of breath and embouchure, since the two have identical range and essentially identical fingering.

The &quot;American baritone&quot;, featuring three valves on the front of the instrument and a curved, forward-pointing bell, was dominant in American school bands throughout most of the 20th century, its weight, shape, and configuration conforming to the needs of the marching band. While this instrument is a conical-cylindrical bore hybrid, somewhere between the classic baritone horn and euphonium, it was almost universally labelled a &quot;baritone&quot; by both band directors and composers, thus contributing to the confusion of terminology in the United States.

Several late 19th century music catalogs (such as Pepper and Lyon &amp; Healy) sold a euphonium-like instrument called the &quot;B bass&quot; (to distinguish it from the E and BB bass). In these catalog drawings, the B Bass had thicker tubing than the baritone; both had three valves. Along the same lines, drum and bugle corps introduced the &quot;Bass-baritone&quot;, and distinguished it from the baritone. The thicker tubing of the three-valve B bass allowed for production of strong false-tones, providing chromatic access to the pedal register.

Ferdinand Sommer&#x27;s original name for the instrument was the &quot;euphonion&quot;. It is sometimes called the tenor tuba in B, although this can also refer to other varieties of tuba. Names in other languages, as included in scores, can be ambiguous as well. They include French &quot;basse&quot;, &quot;saxhorn basse&quot;, and &quot;tuba basse&quot;; German &quot;Baryton&quot;, &quot;Tenorbass&quot;, and &quot;Tenorbasshorn&quot;; Italian &quot;baritono&quot;, &quot;bombardino&quot;, &quot;eufonio&quot;, and &quot;flicorno basso&quot;. The most common German name, &quot;Baryton&quot;, may have influenced Americans to adopt the name &quot;baritone&quot; for the instrument, due to the influx of German musicians to the United States in the nineteenth century.

== History and development ==

As a baritone-voiced brass instrument, the euphonium traces its ancestry to the ophicleide and ultimately back to the serpent. The search for a satisfactory foundational wind instrument that could support massed sound above its pitch took many years. While the serpent was used for over two centuries dating back to the late Renaissance, it was notoriously difficult to control its pitch and tone quality due to its disproportionately small open finger holes. The ophicleide, which was used in bands and orchestras for a few decades in the early to mid-19th century, used a system of keys and was an improvement over the serpent but was still unreliable, especially in the high register.

With the invention of the piston valve system 1818, the construction of brass instruments with an even sound and facility of playing in all registers became possible. The euphonium is said to have been invented, as a &quot;wide-bore, valved bugle of baritone range&quot;, by Ferdinand Sommer of Weimar in 1843, though Carl Moritz in 1838 and Adolphe Sax in 1843 have also been credited. While Sax&#x27;s family of saxhorns were invented at about the same time and the bass saxhorn is very similar to a euphonium, there are also differences—such as the bass saxhorn being narrower throughout the length of the instrument.

The &quot;British-style&quot; compensating euphonium was developed in 1874 by David Blaikley, of Boosey &amp; Co, and has been in use in Britain since then, with the basic construction little changed.

Modern-day euphonium makers have been working to further enhance the construction of the instrument. Companies such as Adams and Besson have been leading the way in that respect. Adams euphoniums have developed an adjustable lead-pipe receiver, which allows players to change the timbre of the instrument to whatever they find preferable. Besson has been credited with introducing an adjustable main tuning-slide trigger, which allows players more flexibility with intonation.

== Construction and general characteristics ==
The euphonium, like the tenor trombone, is pitched in concert B. For a valved brass instrument like the euphonium, this means that when no valves are in use the instrument will produce partials of the B harmonic series. 

Music for the euphonium is generally written at concert pitch in the bass clef, treating the euphonium as a non-transposing instrument like the trombone. Higher passages are sometimes written in the tenor clef. In addition to bass clef euphonium parts, concert band music often includes treble clef euphonium parts in B which sound a major ninth lower than written. In the British-style brass band tradition, euphonium music is always written this way. In continental European band music, parts for the euphonium may also be written in bass clef in B, sounding a major second lower than written.

Professional models have three top-action valves, played with the first three fingers of the right hand, plus a fourth valve, generally found midway down the right side of the instrument, played with the left index finger; such an instrument is shown at the top of this page. Such models also have compensating &quot;knuckles&quot; to resolve intonation issues below E2. Beginner models often have only the three top-action valves, while some intermediate &quot;student&quot; models may have a fourth top-action valve, played with the fourth finger of the right hand. Compensating systems are expensive to build, and there is in general a substantial difference in price between compensating and non-compensating models. For a thorough discussion of the valves and the compensation system, see the article on brass instruments.

The euphonium has an extensive range, from E2 to about F4 for intermediate players (using scientific pitch notation). In professional hands this may extend from B0 to as high as B5. The lowest notes obtainable depend on the valve set-up of the instrument. All instruments are chromatic down to E2, but four-valved instruments extend that down to at least C2. Non-compensating four-valved instruments suffer from intonation problems from E2 down to C2 and cannot produce the low B1; compensating instruments do not have such intonation problems and can play the low B1. From B1 down lies the &quot;pedal range&quot;, i.e., the fundamentals of the instrument&#x27;s harmonic series. They are easily produced on the euphonium as compared to other brass instruments, and the extent of the range depends on the make of the instrument in exactly the same way as just described. Thus, on a compensating four-valved instrument, the lowest note possible is B0, sometimes called double pedal B, which is six ledger lines below the bass clef.

As with the other conical-bore instruments, the cornet, flugelhorn, horn, and tuba, the euphonium&#x27;s tubing (excepting the tubing in the valve section, which is necessarily cylindrical) gradually increases in diameter throughout its length, resulting in a softer, gentler tone compared to cylindrical-bore instruments such as the trumpet, trombone, sudrophone, and baritone horn. While a truly characteristic euphonium sound is rather hard to define precisely, most players would agree that an ideal sound is dark, rich, warm, and velvety, with virtually no hardness to it. This also has to do with the different models preferred by British and American players.

Though the euphonium&#x27;s fingerings are no different from those of the trumpet or tuba, beginning euphoniumists will likely experience significant problems with intonation, response and range compared to other beginning brass players.

== Types ==
===Compensating===

The compensating euphonium is common among professionals. It utilizes a three-plus-one-valve system with three upright valves and one side valve. The compensating valve system uses extra tubing, usually coming off the back of the three upright valves, in order to achieve proper intonation in the lower range of the instrument. This range being from E2 down to B1. Not all four-valve and three-plus-one-valve euphoniums are compensating. Only those designed with extra tubing are compensating. There were, at one time, three-valve compensating euphoniums available. This configuration utilized extra tubing, just as the three-plus-one compensating models did, in order to bring the notes C2 and B1 in tune. This three-valve compensating configuration is still available in British style baritone horns, usually on professional models.

=== Double-bell ===
A creation unique to the United States was the double-bell euphonium, featuring a second smaller bell in addition to the main one; the player could switch bells for certain passages or even for individual notes by use of an additional valve, operated with the left hand. Ostensibly, the smaller bell was intended to emulate the sound of a trombone (it was cylindrical-bore) and was possibly intended for performance situations in which trombones were not available. The extent to which the difference in sound and timbre was apparent to the listener, however, is up for debate. Michele Raffayolo of the Patrick S. Gilmore band introduced the instrument in the U.S. by 1880, and it was used widely in both school and service bands for several decades. &quot;Harold Brasch&quot; (see &quot;List of important players&quot; below) brought the British-style compensating euphonium to the United States c. 1939, but the double-belled euphonium may have remained in common use even into the 1950s and 1960s. In any case, they have become rare (they were last in Conn&#x27;s advertisements in the 1940s, and King&#x27;s catalog in the 1960s), and are generally unknown to younger players. They are chiefly known now through their mention in the song &quot;Seventy-Six Trombones&quot; from the musical &quot;The Music Man&quot; by Meredith Willson.

=== Marching ===

Marching euphoniums are used by marching bands and in drum and bugle corps. Typically in a drum corps, there will be two baritone parts and one euphonium part, with the euphonium playing the lower parts comparatively. Some corps (such as the Blue Devils) march all-euphonium sections rather than only marching baritone or a mix of both. In high school marching bands, the two will often be used interchangeably.

Depending on the manufacturer, the weight of these instruments can be straining to the average marcher and require great strength to hold during practices and performances, leading to nerve problems in the right pinky, a callus on the left hand, and possibly back and arm problems. Marching euphoniums and marching baritones commonly have three valves, opposed to the regular euphonium having four.

Another form of the marching euphonium is the convertible euphonium. Recently widely produced, the horn resembles a convertible tuba, being able to change from a concert upright to a marching forward bell on either the left or right shoulder. These are mainly produced by Jupiter or Yamaha, but other less expensive versions can be found.

=== Five valves ===
The five-valve euphonium (non-compensating) is an extremely rare variation of the euphonium manufactured in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Britain&#x27;s Besson musical instrument company and Highams of Manchester Musical Instrument Company. 
Higham and Besson&#x27;s &quot;Clearbore&quot; five-valve euphonium was economical but not widely used.

The Besson five-valve euphonium featured the standard three piston valves horizontally not on top, but had an additional two piston valves off to the side. The standard euphonium has eight possible fingering and non-fingering positions by which sound is produced. The Besson and the Highams &quot;clearbore&quot; model rare fourth and fifth extra &quot;side&quot; valves change the possible fingering and non-fingering positions from eight to thirty-two.

The term &#x27;five-valve euphonium&#x27; does not refer to variations of the double bell euphonium made by various brass instrument companies during the same time period. Some of the double-bell euphoniums had five valves, with the fifth valve either not on top with the other four, or by itself off to the side, but the double-bell fifth valve was used for switching the sound to the second smaller trombone-sized bell, and not for changing the fingering pitch of the instrument. Also, Cerveny Musical Instruments manufactures several euphoniums with five vertical rotary valves today, but this is an unrelated recent development.

== Notable euphonium players ==
German Ferdinand Sommer, if one discounts the claims of Moritz and Sax each of whose horns also approached a euphonium in nature, in addition to being credited with inventing the euphonium as the Sommerhorn in 1843, as a soloist on the horn, qualifies as the first euphonium player to significantly advance and alter the understanding of the instrument.

=== United Kingdom ===
* Alfred James Phasey (1834–1888), English ophicleide, baritone and euphonium artist credited with modifying the bore of the baritone saxhorn, precursor of the baritone horn, to enlarge it and make it more resonant thereby creating the first true euphonium which he went on to popularize as a performer and author of an early instructional method for tenor brass.
* Steven Mead, English euphonium soloist and professor at the Royal Northern College of Music noted internationally for advancing the British euphonium sound.
* David Thornton, principal euphonium of the Brighouse and Rastrick Band and student of Steven Mead noted for winning several prestigious international competitions and advancing the British euphonium sound through broadcast as well as recording media.
* David Childs, Professor of Euphonium at the University of North Texas. Noted for extensive soloist experience with multiple organizations, amongst other musical accolades.

=== United States ===
* Simone Mantia (1873–1951), an Italian-born American baritone horn/euphonium virtuoso and also trombone artist at the start of the 20th century. Playing as soloist with the Sousa and the Pryor Bands, Mantia was the first euphonium virtuoso to record and popularized this non-orchestral instrument in the United States.
* Leonard Falcone (1899–1985), Italian-born American baritone/euphonium soloist, arranger, professor, Director of Bands at Michigan State University, and teacher of many noted euphonium artists. Falcone advanced an operatic passionate baritone style and is the namesake of the Leonard Falcone International Tuba and Euphonium Festival, the leading venue for the instrument in the United States.
* Arthur W. Lehman, (1917–2009), American euphonium soloist known as &#x27;Art&#x27;, Recording Artist, United States Marine Band, noted euphonium author of works such as &quot;The Art of Euphonium&quot;. Lehman was a student of Harold Brasch and Simone Mantia and advanced the concept of a rich resonant sound with no vibrato pioneered by Mantia.
* Brian Bowman, former soloist with the U.S. Navy Band (1971–75) and U.S. Air Force Band (1976–91); former professor of euphonium at the University of North Texas, co-editor of &quot;Arban&#x27;s Method for Trombone and Euphonium&quot;. Bowman innovated a fusion of the mellow British sound with deep passion heard in Falcone recordings, becoming the best known American artist at the end of the 20th century through recording, teaching and the first euphonium recital at Carnegie Hall.
* Bernard Atwell McKinney, later Kiane Zawadi (1932–2024) jazz trombonist and euphonium player, one of the few jazz soloists on the latter instrument.

=== Japan ===
* Toru Miura, professor of euphonium at the Kunitachi College of Music; soloist and clinician who was awarded a lifetime achievement award by the International Tuba Euphonium Association (formerly TUBA) for his role in promoting the instrument.

=== Brazil ===
* Irineu de Almeida (known as Irineu Batina) (1863–1916), one of the most influential musicians and professors of the genre of Choro, the first Brazilian typical music. Irineu was an active composer, euphoniumist, ophicleidist and professor, and has participated in the first commercial recordings of Brazilian music, from 1900 onwards, in Rio de Janeiro, playing both euphonium and ophicleide, as a composer, soloist and counterpointist. De Almeida was also professor of the prodigy Pixinguinha, who later became the most important developer of the whole genre of Choro, and one of the most important creators in Brazilian music history. Due to Irineu Batina and his contemporaries, the bombardino is an essential part of the genre of Choro, which is an intangible cultural heritage in Brazil.

== Repertoire ==

The &quot;euphonium repertoire&quot; consists of solo literature and orchestral, or, more commonly, concert band parts written for the euphonium. Since its invention in 1843, the euphonium has been important in ensembles. While the Euphonium is predominantly a concert band instrument, certain composers have featured it in symphonic music. Notably, it has iconic appearances in Holst&#x27;s The Planets. Still, solo literature was slow to appear, consisting of only a handful of lighter solos until the 1960s. Since then, however, the breadth and depth of the solo euphonium repertoire has increased dramatically.

In the current age, there has been a huge number of new commissions and repertoire development and promotion through Steven Mead&#x27;s World of the Euphonium Series and the Beyond the Horizon series from Euphonium.com. There has also been a vast number of new commissions by more and more players and a proliferation of large-scale Consortium Commissions that are occurring including current ones in 2008 and 2009 organized by Brian Meixner (Libby Larson), Adam Frey (The Euphonium Foundation Consortium), and Jason Ham (David Gillingham).

Upon its invention, it was clear that the euphonium had, compared to its predecessors the serpent and ophicleide, a wide range and had a consistently rich, pleasing sound throughout that range. It was flexible both in tone quality and intonation and could blend well with a variety of ensembles, gaining it immediate popularity with composers and conductors as the principal tenor-voices solo instrument in brass band settings, especially in Britain. It is no surprise, then, that when British composers – some of the same ones who were writing for brass bands – began to write serious, original music for the concert band in the early 20th century, they used the euphonium in a very similar role.

When American composers also began writing for the concert band as its own artistic medium in the 1930s and 1940s, they continued the British brass and concert band tradition of using the euphonium as the principal tenor-voiced solo.
This is not to say that composers, then and now, valued the euphonium only for its lyrical capabilities. Indeed, examination of a large body of concert band literature reveals that the euphonium functions as a &quot;jack of all trades.&quot;

Though the euphonium was, as previously noted, embraced from its earliest days by composers and arrangers in band settings, orchestral composers have, by and large, not taken advantage of this capability. There are, nevertheless, several orchestral works, a few of which are standard repertoire, in which composers have called for instruments, such as the Wagner tuba, for which euphonium is commonly substituted in the present.

In contrast to the long-standing practice of extensive euphonium use in wind bands and orchestras, there was, until approximately forty years ago, literally no body of solo literature written specifically for the euphonium, and euphonium players were forced to borrow the literature of other instruments. Fortunately, given the instrument&#x27;s multifaceted capabilities discussed above, solos for many different instruments are easily adaptable to performance on the euphonium.

The earliest surviving solo composition written specifically for euphonium or one of its saxhorn cousins is the &quot;Concerto per Flicorno Basso&quot; (1872) by Amilcare Ponchielli. For almost a century after this, the euphonium solo repertoire consisted of only a dozen or so virtuosic pieces, mostly light in character. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, American composers began to write the first of the &quot;new school&quot; of serious, artistic solo works specifically for euphonium. Since then, there has been a virtual explosion of solo repertoire for the euphonium. In a mere four decades, the solo literature has expanded from virtually zero to thousands of pieces. More and more composers have become aware of the tremendous soloistic capabilities of the euphonium, and have constantly &quot;pushed the envelope&quot; with new literature in terms of tessitura, endurance, technical demands, and extended techniques.

Finally, the euphonium has, thanks to a handful of enterprising individuals, begun to make inroads in jazz, pop and other non-concert performance settings. One well-known euphonium player from the world of popular music is Don McGlashan, the New Zealand musician who began his musical career as an orchestral brass player before finding success in popular music with bands such as Blam Blam Blam and The Mutton Birds.

<text>In complex analysis, an entire function, also called an integral function, is a complex-valued function that is holomorphic on the whole complex plane. Typical examples of entire functions are polynomials and the exponential function, and any finite sums, products and compositions of these, such as the trigonometric functions sine and cosine and their hyperbolic counterparts sinh and cosh, as well as derivatives and integrals of entire functions such as the error function. If an entire function formula_1 has a 
root at formula_2, then formula_3, taking the limit value at formula_2, is an entire function. On the other hand, the natural logarithm, the reciprocal function, and the square root are all not entire functions, nor can they be continued analytically to an entire function.

A [[Transcendental function|transcendental]] entire function is an entire function that is not a polynomial.

Just as meromorphic functions can be viewed as a generalization of rational fractions, entire functions can be viewed as a generalization of polynomials. In particular, if for meromorphic functions one can generalize the factorization into simple fractions (the Mittag-Leffler theorem on the decomposition of a meromorphic function), then for entire functions there is a generalization of the factorization — the Weierstrass theorem on entire functions.

==Properties==
Every entire function formula_5 can be represented as a single power series
formula_6
that converges everywhere in the complex plane, hence uniformly on compact sets. The radius of convergence is infinite, which implies that
formula_7
or, equivalently,
formula_8
Any power series satisfying this criterion will represent an entire function.

If (and only if) the coefficients of the power series are all real then the function evidently takes real values for real arguments, and the value of the function at the complex conjugate of formula_9 will be the complex conjugate of the value at formula_10 Such functions are sometimes called self-conjugate (the conjugate function, formula_11 being given by 

If the real part of an entire function is known in a neighborhood of a point then both the real and imaginary parts are known for the whole complex plane, up to an imaginary constant. For instance, if the real part is known in a neighborhood of zero, then we can find the coefficients for formula_12 from the following derivatives with respect to a real variable formula_13:

formula_14

(Likewise, if the imaginary part is known in a neighborhood then the function is determined up to a real constant.) In fact, if the real part is known just on an arc of a circle, then the function is determined up to an imaginary constant.}
Note however that an entire function is not determined by its real part on all curves. In particular, if the real part is given on any curve in the complex plane where the real part of some other entire function is zero, then any multiple of that function can be added to the function we are trying to determine. For example, if the curve where the real part is known is the real line, then we can add formula_15 times any self-conjugate function. If the curve forms a loop, then it is determined by the real part of the function on the loop since the only functions whose real part is zero on the curve are those that are everywhere equal to some imaginary number.

The Weierstrass factorization theorem asserts that any entire function can be represented by a product involving its zeroes (or &quot;roots&quot;).

The entire functions on the complex plane form an integral domain (in fact a Prüfer domain). They also form a commutative unital associative algebra over the complex numbers.

Liouville&#x27;s theorem states that any bounded entire function must be constant.

As a consequence of Liouville&#x27;s theorem, any function that is entire on the whole Riemann sphere
is constant. Thus any non-constant entire function must have a singularity at the complex point at infinity, either a pole for a polynomial or an essential singularity for a transcendental entire function. Specifically, by the Casorati–Weierstrass theorem, for any transcendental entire function formula_16 and any complex formula_2 there is a sequence formula_18 such that

:formula_19

Picard&#x27;s little theorem is a much stronger result: Any non-constant entire function takes on every complex number as value, possibly with a single exception. When an exception exists, it is called a lacunary value of the function. The possibility of a lacunary value is illustrated by the exponential function, which never takes on the value formula_20. One can take a suitable branch of the logarithm of an entire function that never hits formula_20, so that this will also be an entire function (according to the Weierstrass factorization theorem). The logarithm hits every complex number except possibly one number, which implies that the first function will hit any value other than formula_20 an infinite number of times. Similarly, a non-constant, entire function that does not hit a particular value will hit every other value an infinite number of times.

Liouville&#x27;s theorem is a special case of the following statement:

==Growth==

Entire functions may grow as fast as any increasing function: for any increasing function 
formula_23 there exists an entire function formula_16 such that 
formula_25 for all real formula_26. Such a function formula_16 may be easily found of the form:

formula_28

for a constant formula_29 and a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers formula_30. Any such sequence defines an entire function formula_1, and if the powers are chosen appropriately we may satisfy the inequality formula_25 for all real formula_26. (For instance, it certainly holds if one chooses formula_34 and, for any integer formula_35 one chooses an even exponent formula_36 such that formula_37).

== Order and type ==
The order (at infinity) of an entire function formula_1 is defined using the limit superior as:

formula_39

where formula_40 is the disk of radius formula_13 and formula_42 denotes the supremum norm of formula_1 on formula_40. The order is a non-negative real number or infinity (except when formula_45 for all formula_9). In other words, the order of formula_1 is the infimum of all formula_48 such that:

formula_49

The example of formula_50 shows that this does not mean formula_51 if 
formula_1 is of order formula_48.

If formula_54 one can also define the type:

formula_55

If the order is 1 and the type is formula_56, the function is said to be &quot;of exponential type formula_56&quot;. If it is of order less than 1 it is said to be of exponential type 0.

If formula_58 then the order and type can be found by the formulas
formula_59

Let formula_60 denote the formula_61-th derivative of formula_16. Then we may restate these formulas in terms of the derivatives at any arbitrary point formula_63:

formula_64

The type may be infinite, as in the case of the reciprocal gamma function, or zero (see example below under ).

Another way to find out the order and type is Matsaev&#x27;s theorem.

===Examples===
Here are some examples of functions of various orders:

====Order &quot;ρ&quot;====
For arbitrary positive numbers formula_65 and formula_56 one can construct an example of an entire function of order formula_65 and type formula_56 using:

formula_69

====Order 0====
* Non-zero polynomials
*formula_70

====Order 1/4====
formula_71 
where formula_72

====Order 1/3====
formula_73
where
formula_74

====Order 1/2====
formula_75 with formula_76 (for which the type is given by formula_77)

====Order 1====
*formula_78 with formula_76 (formula_77)
*formula_81
*formula_82
*the Bessel functions formula_83 and spherical Bessel functions formula_84 for integer values of formula_61
*the reciprocal gamma function formula_86 (formula_56 is infinite)
*formula_88

====Order 3/2====
* Airy function formula_89

====Order 2====
*formula_90 with formula_76 (formula_77)
*The Barnes G-function (formula_56 is infinite).

====Order infinity====
*formula_94

== Genus==
Entire functions of finite order have Hadamard&#x27;s canonical representation (Hadamard factorization theorem):

formula_95

where formula_96 are those roots of formula_16 that are not zero (formula_98), formula_48 is the order of the zero of formula_16 at formula_101 (the case formula_102 being taken to mean formula_103), formula_104 a polynomial (whose degree we shall call formula_105), and formula_106 is the smallest non-negative integer such that the series

formula_107

converges. The non-negative integer formula_108 is called the genus of the entire function formula_16.

If the order formula_65 is not an integer, then formula_111 is the integer part of formula_65. If the order is a positive integer, then there are two possibilities: formula_113 or formula_114.

For example, formula_115, formula_116 and formula_117 are entire functions of genus formula_118.

==Other examples==
According to J. E. Littlewood, the Weierstrass sigma function is a &#x27;typical&#x27; entire function. This statement can be made precise in the theory of random entire functions: the asymptotic behavior of almost all entire functions is similar to that of the sigma function. Other examples include the Fresnel integrals, the Jacobi theta function, and the reciprocal Gamma function. The exponential function and the error function are special cases of the Mittag-Leffler function. According to the fundamental theorem of Paley and Wiener, Fourier transforms of functions (or distributions) with bounded support are entire functions of order formula_119 and finite type.

Other examples are solutions of linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients. If the coefficient at the highest derivative is constant, then all solutions of such equations are entire functions. For example, the exponential function, sine, cosine, Airy functions and Parabolic cylinder functions arise in this way. The class of entire functions is closed with respect to compositions. This makes it possible to study dynamics of entire functions.

An entire function of the square root of a complex number is entire if the original function is even, for example formula_120.

If a sequence of polynomials all of whose roots are real converges in a neighborhood of the origin to a limit which is not identically equal to zero, then this limit is an entire function. Such entire functions form the Laguerre–Pólya class, which can also be characterized in terms of the Hadamard product, namely, formula_16 belongs to this class if and only if in the Hadamard representation all formula_122 are real, formula_123, and 
formula_124, where formula_125 and formula_29 are real, and formula_127. For example, the sequence of polynomials

formula_128

converges, as formula_61 increases, to formula_130. The polynomials

formula_131

have all real roots, and converge to formula_132. The polynomials

formula_133

also converge to formula_132, showing the buildup of the Hadamard product for cosine.

<doc id="10374" wikidata="Q35760" url="?curid=10374" title="Essay">
<text>An essay is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author&#x27;s own argument, but the definition is vague, overlapping with those of a letter, a paper, an article, a pamphlet, and a short story. Essays have been sub-classified as formal and informal: formal essays are characterized by &quot;serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length,&quot; whereas the informal essay is characterized by &quot;the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme,&quot; etc.

Essays are commonly used as literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been dubbed essays (e.g., Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on Criticism&quot; and &quot;An Essay on Man&quot;). While brevity usually defines an essay, voluminous works like John Locke&#x27;s &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; and Thomas Malthus&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on the Principle of Population&quot; are counterexamples.

In some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays have become a major part of formal education. Secondary students are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills; admission essays are often used by universities in selecting applicants, and in the humanities and social sciences essays are often used as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams.

The concept of an &quot;essay&quot; has been extended to other media beyond writing. A film essay is a movie that often incorporates documentary filmmaking styles and focuses more on the evolution of a theme or idea. A photographic essay covers a topic with a linked series of photographs that may have accompanying text or captions.

==Definitions==

The word &quot;essay&quot; derives from the French infinitive , &quot;to try&quot; or &quot;to attempt&quot;. In English &quot;essay&quot; first meant &quot;a trial&quot; or &quot;an attempt&quot;, and this is still an alternative meaning. The Frenchman Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) was the first author to describe his work as essays; he used the term to characterize these as &quot;attempts&quot; to put his thoughts into writing.

Subsequently, &quot;essay&quot; has been defined in a variety of ways. One definition is a &quot;prose composition with a focused subject of discussion&quot; or a &quot;long, systematic discourse&quot;.
It is difficult to define the genre into which essays fall. Aldous Huxley, a leading essayist, gives guidance on the subject. He notes that &quot;the essay is a literary device for saying almost everything about almost anything&quot;, and adds that &quot;by tradition, almost by definition, the essay is a short piece&quot;. Furthermore, Huxley argues that &quot;essays belong to a literary species whose extreme variability can be studied most effectively within a three-poled frame of reference&quot;.
These three poles (or worlds in which the essay may exist) are:
* The personal and the autobiographical: The essayists that feel most comfortable in this pole &quot;write fragments of reflective autobiography and look at the world through the keyhole of anecdote and description&quot;.
* The objective, the factual, and the concrete particular: The essayists that write from this pole &quot;do not speak directly of themselves, but turn their attention outward to some literary or scientific or political theme. Their art consists of setting forth, passing judgment upon, and drawing general conclusions from the relevant data&quot;.
* The abstract-universal: In this pole &quot;we find those essayists who do their work in the world of high abstractions&quot;, who are never personal and who seldom mention the particular facts of experience.
Huxley adds that the most satisfying essays &quot;...make the best not of one, not of two, but of all the three worlds in which it is possible for the essay to exist.&quot;

==History==
===Montaigne===
Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;attempts&quot; grew out of his commonplacing. Inspired in particular by the works of Plutarch, a translation of whose &quot;Œuvres Morales&quot; (&quot;Moral works&quot;) into French had just been published by Jacques Amyot, Montaigne began to compose his essays in 1572; the first edition, entitled &quot;Essais&quot;, was published in two volumes in 1580. For the rest of his life, he continued revising previously published essays and composing new ones. A third volume was published posthumously; together, their over 100 examples are widely regarded as the predecessor of the modern essay.

===Europe===
While Montaigne&#x27;s philosophy was admired and copied in France, none of his most immediate disciples tried to write essays. But Montaigne, who liked to fancy that his family (the Eyquem line) was of English extraction, had spoken of the English people as his &quot;cousins&quot;, and he was early read in England, notably by Francis Bacon.

Bacon&#x27;s essays, published in book form in 1597 (only five years after the death of Montaigne, containing the first ten of his essays), 1612, and 1625, were the first works in English that described themselves as &quot;essays&quot;. Ben Jonson first used the word &quot;essayist&quot; in 1609, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.
Other English essayists included Sir William Cornwallis, who published essays in 1600 and 1617 that were popular at the time, Robert Burton (1577–1641) and Sir Thomas Browne (1605–1682). In Italy, Baldassare Castiglione wrote about courtly manners in his essay &quot;Il Cortigiano&quot;. In the 17th century, the Spanish Jesuit Baltasar Gracián wrote about the theme of wisdom.

In England, during the Age of Enlightenment, essays were a favored tool of polemicists who aimed at convincing readers of their position; they also featured heavily in the rise of periodical literature, as seen in the works of Joseph Addison, Richard Steele and Samuel Johnson. Addison and Steele used the journal &quot;Tatler&quot; (founded in 1709 by Steele) and its successors as storehouses of their work, and they became the most celebrated eighteenth-century essayists in England. Johnson&#x27;s essays appear during the 1750s in various similar publications. As a result of the focus on journals, the term also acquired a meaning synonymous with &quot;article&quot;, although the content may not the strict definition. On the other hand, Locke&#x27;s &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; is not an essay at all, or cluster of essays, in the technical sense, but still it refers to the experimental and tentative nature of the inquiry which the philosopher was undertaking.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Edmund Burke and Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote essays for the general public. The early 19th century, in particular, saw a proliferation of great essayists in English—William Hazlitt, Charles Lamb, Leigh Hunt and Thomas De Quincey all penned numerous essays on diverse subjects, reviving the earlier graceful style. Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s essays were highly influential, and one of his readers, Ralph Waldo Emerson, became a prominent essayist himself. Later in the century, Robert Louis Stevenson also raised the form&#x27;s literary level. In the 20th century, a number of essayists, such as T.S. Eliot, tried to explain the new movements in art and culture by using essays. Virginia Woolf, Edmund Wilson, and Charles du Bos wrote literary criticism essays.

In France, several writers produced longer works with the title of that were not true examples of the form. However, by the mid-19th century, the &quot;Causeries du lundi&quot;, newspaper columns by the critic Sainte-Beuve, are literary essays in the original sense. Other French writers followed suit, including Théophile Gautier, Anatole France, Jules Lemaître and Émile Faguet.

===Japan===

As with the novel, essays existed in Japan several centuries before they developed in Europe with a genre of essays known as &quot;zuihitsu&quot;—loosely connected essays and fragmented ideas. Zuihitsu have existed since almost the beginnings of Japanese literature. Many of the most noted early works of Japanese literature are in this genre. Notable examples include &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; (c. 1000), by court lady Sei Shōnagon, and &quot;Tsurezuregusa&quot; (1330), by particularly renowned Japanese Buddhist monk Yoshida Kenkō. Kenkō described his short writings similarly to Montaigne, referring to them as &quot;nonsensical thoughts&quot; written in &quot;idle hours&quot;. Another noteworthy difference from Europe is that women have traditionally written in Japan, though the more formal, Chinese-influenced writings of male writers were more prized at the time.

=== China ===
The eight-legged essay (Chinese: 八股文; pinyin: &quot;bāgǔwén&quot;; &#x27;eight bone text&#x27;) was a style of essay in imperial examinations during the Ming and Qing dynasties in China. The eight-legged essay was needed for those test takers in these civil service tests to show their merits for government service, often focusing on Confucian thought and knowledge of the Four Books and Five Classics, in relation to governmental ideals. Test takers could not write in innovative or creative ways, but needed to conform to the standards of the eight-legged essay. Various skills were examined, including the ability to write coherently and to display basic logic. In certain times, the candidates were expected to spontaneously compose poetry upon a set theme, whose value was also sometimes questioned, or eliminated as part of the test material. This was a major argument in favor of the eight-legged essay, arguing that it were better to eliminate creative art in favor of prosaic literacy. In the history of Chinese literature, the eight-legged essay is often said to have caused China&#x27;s &quot;cultural stagnation and economic backwardness&quot; in the 19th century.

==Forms and styles==
This section describes the different forms and styles of essay writing. These are used by an array of authors, including university students and professional essayists.

===Cause and effect===
The defining features of a &quot;cause and effect&quot; essay are causal chains that connect from a cause to an effect, careful language, and chronological or emphatic order. A writer using this rhetorical method must consider the subject, determine the purpose, consider the audience, think critically about different causes or consequences, consider a thesis statement, arrange the parts, consider the language, and decide on a conclusion.

===Classification and division===
Classification is the categorization of objects into a larger whole while division is the breaking of a larger whole into smaller parts.

===Compare and contrast===
Compare and contrast essays are characterized by a basis for comparison, points of comparison, and analogies. It is grouped by the object (chunking) or by point (sequential). The comparison highlights the similarities between two or more similar objects while contrasting highlights the differences between two or more objects. When writing a compare/contrast essay, writers need to determine their purpose, consider their audience, consider the basis and points of comparison, consider their thesis statement, arrange and develop the comparison, and reach a conclusion. Compare and contrast is arranged emphatically.

=== Expository ===
An expository essay is used to inform, describe or explain a topic, using important facts to teach the reader about a topic. Mostly written in third-person, using &quot;it&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;they,&quot; the expository essay uses formal language to discuss someone or something. Examples of expository essays are: a medical or biological condition, social or technological process, life or character of a famous person. The writing of an expository essay often consists of the following steps: organizing thoughts (brainstorming), researching a topic, developing a thesis statement, writing the introduction, writing the body of essay, and writing the conclusion. Expository essays are often assigned as a part of SAT and other standardized testing or as homework for high school and college students.

===Descriptive===
Descriptive writing is characterized by sensory details, which appeal to the physical senses, and details that appeal to a reader&#x27;s emotional, physical, or intellectual sensibilities. Determining the purpose, considering the audience, creating a dominant impression, using descriptive language, and organizing the description are the rhetorical choices to consider when using a description. A description is usually arranged spatially but can also be chronological or emphatic. The focus of a description is the scene. Description uses tools such as denotative language, connotative language, figurative language, metaphor, and simile to arrive at a dominant impression. One university essay guide states that &quot;descriptive writing says what happened or what another author has discussed; it provides an account of the topic&quot;.
Lyric essays are an important form of descriptive essays.

===Dialectic===
In the dialectic form of the essay, which is commonly used in philosophy, the writer makes a thesis and argument, then objects to their own argument (with a counterargument), but then counters the counterargument with a final and novel argument. This form benefits from presenting a broader perspective while countering a possible flaw that some may present. This type is sometimes called an ethics paper.

===Exemplification===
An exemplification essay is characterized by a generalization and relevant, representative, and believable examples including anecdotes. Writers need to consider their subject, determine their purpose, consider their audience, decide on specific examples, and arrange all the parts together when writing an exemplification essay.
===Familiar===
An essayist writes a &quot;familiar essay&quot; if speaking to a single reader, writing about both themselves, and about particular subjects. Anne Fadiman notes that &quot;the genre&#x27;s heyday was the early nineteenth century,&quot; and that its greatest exponent was Charles Lamb. She also suggests that while critical essays have more brain than the heart, and personal essays have more heart than brain, familiar essays have equal measures of both.

===History (thesis)===
A history essay sometimes referred to as a thesis essay describes an argument or claim about one or more historical events and supports that claim with evidence, arguments, and references. The text makes it clear to the reader why the argument or claim is as such.

===Narrative===
A narrative uses tools such as flashbacks, flash-forwards, and transitions that often build to a climax. The focus of a narrative is the plot. When creating a narrative, authors must determine their purpose, consider their audience, establish their point of view, use dialogue, and organize the narrative. A narrative is usually arranged chronologically.

===Argumentative===
An argumentative essay is a critical piece of writing, aimed at presenting objective analysis of the subject matter, narrowed down to a single topic. The main idea of all the criticism is to provide an opinion either of positive or negative implication. As such, a critical essay requires research and analysis, strong internal logic and sharp structure. Its structure normally builds around introduction with a topic&#x27;s relevance and a thesis statement, body paragraphs with arguments linking back to the main thesis, and conclusion. In addition, an argumentative essay may include a refutation section where conflicting ideas are acknowledged, described, and criticized. Each argument of an argumentative essay should be supported with sufficient evidence, relevant to the point.

=== Process ===
A process essay is used for an explanation of making or breaking something. Often, it is written in chronological order or numerical order to show step-by-step processes. It has all the qualities of a technical document with the only difference is that it is often written in descriptive mood, while a technical document is mostly in imperative mood.

===Economic===
An economic essay can start with a thesis, or it can start with a theme. It can take a narrative course and a descriptive course. It can even become an argumentative essay if the author feels the need. After the introduction, the author has to do his/her best to expose the economic matter at hand, to analyze it, evaluate it, and draw a conclusion. If the essay takes more of a narrative form then the author has to expose each aspect of the economic puzzle in a way that makes it clear and understandable for the reader

===Reflective===
A &quot;reflective essay&quot; is an analytical piece of writing in which the writer describes a real or imaginary scene, event, interaction, passing thought, memory, or form—adding a personal reflection on the meaning of the topic in the author&#x27;s life. Thus, the focus is not merely descriptive. The writer doesn&#x27;t just describe the situation, but revisits the scene with more detail and emotion to examine what went well, or reveal a need for additional learning—and may relate what transpired to the rest of the author&#x27;s life.

===Other logical structures===
The logical progression and organizational structure of an essay can take many forms. Understanding how the movement of thought is managed through an essay has a profound impact on its overall cogency and ability to impress. A number of alternative logical structures for essays have been visualized as diagrams, making them easy to implement or adapt in the construction of an argument.

==Academic==
In countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, essays have become a major part of a formal education in the form of free response questions. Secondary students in these countries are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills, and essays are often used by universities in these countries in selecting applicants (&quot;see&quot; admissions essay). In both secondary and tertiary education, essays are used to judge the mastery and comprehension of the material. Students are asked to explain, comment on, or assess a topic of study in the form of an essay. In some courses, university students must complete one or more essays over several weeks or months. In addition, in fields such as the humanities and social sciences, mid-term and end of term examinations often require students to write a short essay in two or three hours.

In these countries, so-called academic essays, also called &quot;papers&quot;, are usually more formal than literary ones. They may still allow the presentation of the writer&#x27;s own views, but this is done in a logical and factual manner, with the use of the first person often discouraged. Longer academic essays (often with a word limit of between 2,000 and 5,000 words) are often more discursive. They sometimes begin with a short summary analysis of what has previously been written on a topic, which is often called a literature review.

Longer essays may also contain an introductory page that defines words and phrases of the essay&#x27;s topic. Most academic institutions require that all substantial facts, quotations, and other supporting material in an essay be referenced in a bibliography or works cited page at the end of the text. This scholarly convention helps others (whether teachers or fellow scholars) to understand the basis of facts and quotations the author uses to support the essay&#x27;s argument. The bibliography also helps readers evaluate to what extent the argument is supported by evidence and to evaluate the quality of that evidence. The academic essay tests the student&#x27;s ability to present their thoughts in an organized way and is designed to test their intellectual capabilities.

One of the challenges facing universities is that in some cases, students may submit essays purchased from an essay mill (or &quot;paper mill&quot;) as their own work. An &quot;essay mill&quot; is a ghostwriting service that sells pre-written essays to university and college students. Since plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty or academic fraud, universities and colleges may investigate papers they suspect are from an essay mill by using plagiarism detection software, which compares essays against a database of known mill essays and by orally testing students on the contents of their papers.

==Magazine or newspaper==

Essays often appear in magazines, especially magazines with an intellectual bent, such as &quot;The Atlantic&quot; and &quot;Harpers&quot;. Magazine and newspaper essays use many of the essay types described in the section on forms and styles (e.g., descriptive essays, narrative essays, etc.). Some newspapers also print essays in the op-ed section.
==Employment==
Employment essays detailing experience in a certain occupational field are required when applying for some jobs, especially government jobs in the United States. Essays known as Knowledge Skills and Executive Core Qualifications are required when applying to certain US federal government positions.

A KSA, or &quot;Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities&quot;, is a series of narrative statements that are required when applying to Federal government job openings in the United States. KSAs are used along with resumes to determine who the best applicants are when several candidates qualify for a job. The knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary for the successful performance of a position are contained on each job vacancy announcement. KSAs are brief and focused essays about one&#x27;s career and educational background that presumably qualify one to perform the duties of the position being applied for.

An Executive Core Qualification, or ECQ, is a narrative statement that is required when applying to Senior Executive Service positions within the US Federal government. Like the KSAs, ECQs are used along with resumes to determine who the best applicants are when several candidates qualify for a job. The Office of Personnel Management has established five executive core qualifications that all applicants seeking to enter the Senior Executive Service must demonstrate.

==Non-literary types==
===Film===

A film essay (also essay film or cinematic essay) consists of the evolution of a theme or an idea rather than a plot per se, or the film literally being a cinematic accompaniment to a narrator reading an essay. From another perspective, an essay film could be defined as a documentary film visual basis combined with a form of commentary that contains elements of self-portrait (rather than autobiography), where the signature (rather than the life story) of the filmmaker is apparent. The cinematic essay often blends documentary, fiction, and experimental film making using tones and editing styles.

The genre is not well-defined but might include propaganda works of early Soviet filmmakers like Dziga Vertov, present-day filmmakers including Chris Marker, Michael Moore (&quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot;, &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; and &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;), Errol Morris (&quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;), Morgan Spurlock (&quot;Supersize Me&quot;) and Agnès Varda. Jean-Luc Godard describes his recent work as &quot;film-essays&quot;. Two filmmakers whose work was the antecedent to the cinematic essay include Georges Méliès and Bertolt Brecht. Méliès made a short film (&quot;The Coronation of Edward VII&quot; (1902)) about the 1902 coronation of King Edward VII, which mixes actual footage with shots of a recreation of the event. Brecht was a playwright who experimented with film and incorporated film projections into some of his plays. Orson Welles made an essay film in his own pioneering style, released in 1974, called &quot;F for Fake&quot;, which dealt specifically with art forger Elmyr de Hory and with the themes of deception, &quot;fakery&quot;, and authenticity in general.

David Winks Gray&#x27;s article &quot;The essay film in action&quot; states that the &quot;essay film became an identifiable form of filmmaking in the 1950s and &#x27;60s&quot;. He states that since that time, essay films have tended to be &quot;on the margins&quot; of the filmmaking the world. Essay films have a &quot;peculiar searching, questioning tone ... between documentary and fiction&quot; but without &quot;fitting comfortably&quot; into either genre. Gray notes that just like written essays, essay films &quot;tend to marry the personal voice of a guiding narrator (often the director) with a wide swath of other voices&quot;. The University of Wisconsin Cinematheque website echoes some of Gray&#x27;s comments; it calls a film essay an &quot;intimate and allusive&quot; genre that &quot;catches filmmakers in a pensive mood, ruminating on the margins between fiction and documentary&quot; in a manner that is &quot;refreshingly inventive, playful, and idiosyncratic&quot;.

===Video===

Video essays are an emerging media type similar to film essays. Video essays have gained significant prominence on YouTube, as YouTube&#x27;s policies on free uploads of arbitrary lengths have made it a hotbed. Some video essays feature long, documentary style writing and editing, going deep into the research and history of a particular topic. Others are more akin to an argumentative essay in which a single argument is developed and supported throughout the video. Video essay styles have become especially prominent among BreadTube creators such as ContraPoints and PhilosophyTube. 

===Music===
In the realm of music, composer Samuel Barber wrote a set of &quot;Essays for Orchestra&quot;, relying on the form and content of the music to guide the listener&#x27;s ear, rather than any extra-musical plot or story.

===Photography===
A photographic essay strives to cover a topic with a linked series of photographs. Photo essays range from purely photographic works to photographs with captions or small notes to full-text essays with a few or many accompanying photographs. Photo essays can be sequential in nature, intended to be viewed in a particular order—or they may consist of non-ordered photographs viewed all at once or in an order that the viewer chooses. All photo essays are collections of photographs, but not all collections of photographs are photo essays. Photo essays often address a certain issue or attempt to capture the character of places and events.
===Visual arts===
In the visual arts, an essay is a preliminary drawing or sketch that forms a basis for a final painting or sculpture, made as a test of the work&#x27;s composition (this meaning of the term, like several of those following, comes from the word &quot;essay&quot;&#x27;s meaning of &quot;attempt&quot; or &quot;trial&quot;).

<text>In information theory and coding theory with applications in computer science and telecommunications, error detection and correction (EDAC) or error control are techniques that enable reliable delivery of digital data over unreliable communication channels. Many communication channels are subject to channel noise, and thus errors may be introduced during transmission from the source to a receiver. Error detection techniques allow detecting such errors, while error correction enables reconstruction of the original data in many cases.

== Definitions ==
&quot;Error detection&quot; is the detection of errors caused by noise or other impairments during transmission from the transmitter to the receiver.

&quot;Error correction&quot; is the detection of errors and reconstruction of the original, error-free data.

== History ==
In classical antiquity, copyists of the Hebrew Bible were paid for their work according to the number of s (lines of verse). As the prose books of the Bible were hardly ever written in stichs, the copyists, in order to estimate the amount of work, had to count the letters. This also helped ensure accuracy in the transmission of the text with the production of subsequent copies. Between the 7th and 10th centuries CE a group of Jewish scribes formalized and expanded this to create the Numerical Masorah to ensure accurate reproduction of the sacred text. It included counts of the number of words in a line, section, book and groups of books, noting the middle stich of a book, word use statistics, and commentary. Standards became such that a deviation in even a single letter in a Torah scroll was considered unacceptable. The effectiveness of their error correction method was verified by the accuracy of copying through the centuries demonstrated by discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947–1956, dating from .

The modern development of error correction codes is credited to Richard Hamming in 1947. A description of Hamming&#x27;s code appeared in Claude Shannon&#x27;s &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot; and was quickly generalized by Marcel J. E. Golay.

== Principles ==
All error-detection and correction schemes add some redundancy (i.e., some extra data) to a message, which receivers can use to check consistency of the delivered message and to recover data that has been determined to be corrupted. Error detection and correction schemes can be either systematic or non-systematic. In a systematic scheme, the transmitter sends the original (error-free) data and attaches a fixed number of &quot;check bits&quot; (or &quot;parity data&quot;), which are derived from the data bits by some encoding algorithm. If error detection is required, a receiver can simply apply the same algorithm to the received data bits and compare its output with the received check bits; if the values do not match, an error has occurred at some point during the transmission. If error correction is required, a receiver can apply the decoding algorithm to the received data bits and the received check bits to recover the original error-free data. In a system that uses a non-systematic code, the original message is transformed into an encoded message carrying the same information and that has at least as many bits as the original message.

Good error control performance requires the scheme to be selected based on the characteristics of the communication channel. Common channel models include memoryless models where errors occur randomly and with a certain probability, and dynamic models where errors occur primarily in bursts. Consequently, error-detecting and -correcting codes can be generally distinguished between &quot;random-error-detecting/correcting&quot; and &quot;burst-error-detecting/correcting&quot;. Some codes can also be suitable for a mixture of random errors and burst errors.

If the channel characteristics cannot be determined, or are highly variable, an error-detection scheme may be combined with a system for retransmissions of erroneous data. This is known as automatic repeat request (ARQ), and is most notably used in the Internet. An alternate approach for error control is hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ), which is a combination of ARQ and error-correction coding.

== Types of error correction ==
There are three major types of error correction:

=== Automatic repeat request ===
Automatic repeat request (ARQ) is an error control method for data transmission that makes use of error-detection codes, acknowledgment and/or negative acknowledgment messages, and timeouts to achieve reliable data transmission. An &quot;acknowledgment&quot; is a message sent by the receiver to indicate that it has correctly received a data frame.

Usually, when the transmitter does not receive the acknowledgment before the timeout occurs (i.e., within a reasonable amount of time after sending the data frame), it retransmits the frame until it is either correctly received or the error persists beyond a predetermined number of retransmissions.

Three types of ARQ protocols are Stop-and-wait ARQ, Go-Back-N ARQ, and Selective Repeat ARQ.

ARQ is appropriate if the communication channel has varying or unknown capacity, such as is the case on the Internet. However, ARQ requires the availability of a back channel, results in possibly increased latency due to retransmissions, and requires the maintenance of buffers and timers for retransmissions, which in the case of network congestion can put a strain on the server and overall network capacity.

For example, ARQ is used on shortwave radio data links in the form of ARQ-E, or combined with multiplexing as ARQ-M.

=== Forward error correction ===
Forward error correction (FEC) is a process of adding redundant data such as an error-correcting code (ECC) to a message so that it can be recovered by a receiver even when a number of errors (up to the capability of the code being used) are introduced, either during the process of transmission or on storage. Since the receiver does not have to ask the sender for retransmission of the data, a backchannel is not required in forward error correction. Error-correcting codes are used in lower-layer communication such as cellular network, high-speed fiber-optic communication and Wi-Fi, as well as for reliable storage in media such as flash memory, hard disk and RAM.

Error-correcting codes are usually distinguished between convolutional codes and block codes:
* &quot;Convolutional codes&quot; are processed on a bit-by-bit basis. They are particularly suitable for implementation in hardware, and the Viterbi decoder allows optimal decoding.
* &quot;Block codes&quot; are processed on a block-by-block basis. Early examples of block codes are repetition codes, Hamming codes and multidimensional parity-check codes. They were followed by a number of efficient codes, Reed–Solomon codes being the most notable due to their current widespread use. Turbo codes and low-density parity-check codes (LDPC) are relatively new constructions that can provide almost optimal efficiency.

Shannon&#x27;s theorem is an important theorem in forward error correction, and describes the maximum information rate at which reliable communication is possible over a channel that has a certain error probability or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This strict upper limit is expressed in terms of the channel capacity. More specifically, the theorem says that there exist codes such that with increasing encoding length the probability of error on a discrete memoryless channel can be made arbitrarily small, provided that the code rate is smaller than the channel capacity. The code rate is defined as the fraction &quot;k/n&quot; of &quot;k&quot; source symbols and &quot;n&quot; encoded symbols.

The actual maximum code rate allowed depends on the error-correcting code used, and may be lower. This is because Shannon&#x27;s proof was only of existential nature, and did not show how to construct codes that are both optimal and have efficient encoding and decoding algorithms.

=== Hybrid schemes ===

Hybrid ARQ is a combination of ARQ and forward error correction. There are two basic approaches:
* Messages are always transmitted with FEC parity data (and error-detection redundancy). A receiver decodes a message using the parity information and requests retransmission using ARQ only if the parity data was not sufficient for successful decoding (identified through a failed integrity check).
* Messages are transmitted without parity data (only with error-detection information). If a receiver detects an error, it requests FEC information from the transmitter using ARQ and uses it to reconstruct the original message.

The latter approach is particularly attractive on an erasure channel when using a rateless erasure code.
== Types of error detection ==
Error detection is most commonly realized using a suitable hash function (or specifically, a checksum, cyclic redundancy check or other algorithm). A hash function adds a fixed-length &quot;tag&quot; to a message, which enables receivers to verify the delivered message by recomputing the tag and comparing it with the one provided.

There exists a vast variety of different hash function designs. However, some are of particularly widespread use because of either their simplicity or their suitability for detecting certain kinds of errors (e.g., the cyclic redundancy check&#x27;s performance in detecting burst errors).

=== Minimum distance coding ===
A random-error-correcting code based on minimum distance coding can provide a strict guarantee on the number of detectable errors, but it may not protect against a preimage attack.

=== Repetition codes ===
A repetition code is a coding scheme that repeats the bits across a channel to achieve error-free communication. Given a stream of data to be transmitted, the data are divided into blocks of bits. Each block is transmitted some predetermined number of times. For example, to send the bit pattern , the four-bit block can be repeated three times, thus producing . If this twelve-bit pattern was received as – where the first block is unlike the other two – an error has occurred.

A repetition code is very inefficient and can be susceptible to problems if the error occurs in exactly the same place for each group (e.g., in the previous example would be detected as correct). The advantage of repetition codes is that they are extremely simple, and are in fact used in some transmissions of numbers stations.

=== Parity bit ===

A &quot;parity bit&quot; is a bit that is added to a group of source bits to ensure that the number of set bits (i.e., bits with value 1) in the outcome is even or odd. It is a very simple scheme that can be used to detect single or any other odd number (i.e., three, five, etc.) of errors in the output. An even number of flipped bits will make the parity bit appear correct even though the data is erroneous.

Parity bits added to each &quot;word&quot; sent are called transverse redundancy checks, while those added at the end of a stream of &quot;words&quot; are called longitudinal redundancy checks. For example, if each of a series of m-bit &quot;words&quot; has a parity bit added, showing whether there were an odd or even number of ones in that word, any word with a single error in it will be detected. It will not be known where in the word the error is, however. If, in addition, after each stream of n words a parity sum is sent, each bit of which shows whether there were an odd or even number of ones at that bit-position sent in the most recent group, the exact position of the error can be determined and the error corrected. This method is only guaranteed to be effective, however, if there are no more than 1 error in every group of n words. With more error correction bits, more errors can be detected and in some cases corrected.

There are also other bit-grouping techniques.

=== Checksum ===

A &quot;checksum&quot; of a message is a modular arithmetic sum of message code words of a fixed word length (e.g., byte values). The sum may be negated by means of a ones&#x27;-complement operation prior to transmission to detect unintentional all-zero messages.

Checksum schemes include parity bits, check digits, and longitudinal redundancy checks. Some checksum schemes, such as the Damm algorithm, the Luhn algorithm, and the Verhoeff algorithm, are specifically designed to detect errors commonly introduced by humans in writing down or remembering identification numbers.

=== Cyclic redundancy check ===

A &quot;cyclic redundancy check&quot; (CRC) is a non-secure hash function designed to detect accidental changes to digital data in computer networks. It is not suitable for detecting maliciously introduced errors. It is characterized by specification of a &quot;generator polynomial&quot;, which is used as the divisor in a polynomial long division over a finite field, taking the input data as the dividend. The remainder becomes the result.

A CRC has properties that make it well suited for detecting burst errors. CRCs are particularly easy to implement in hardware and are therefore commonly used in computer networks and storage devices such as hard disk drives.

The parity bit can be seen as a special-case 1-bit CRC.

=== Cryptographic hash function ===

The output of a &quot;cryptographic hash function&quot;, also known as a &quot;message digest&quot;, can provide strong assurances about data integrity, whether changes of the data are accidental (e.g., due to transmission errors) or maliciously introduced. Any modification to the data will likely be detected through a mismatching hash value. Furthermore, given some hash value, it is typically infeasible to find some input data (other than the one given) that will yield the same hash value. If an attacker can change not only the message but also the hash value, then a &quot;keyed hash&quot; or message authentication code (MAC) can be used for additional security. Without knowing the key, it is not possible for the attacker to easily or conveniently calculate the correct keyed hash value for a modified message.

=== Digital signature ===

Digital signatures can provide strong assurances about data integrity, whether the changes of the data are accidental or maliciously introduced.
Digital signatures are perhaps most notable for being part of the HTTPS protocol for securely browsing the web.

=== Error correction code ===

Any error-correcting code can be used for error detection. A code with &quot;minimum Hamming distance&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, can detect up to &quot;d&quot; − 1 errors in a code word. Using minimum-distance-based error-correcting codes for error detection can be suitable if a strict limit on the minimum number of errors to be detected is desired.

Codes with minimum Hamming distance &quot;d&quot; = 2 are degenerate cases of error-correcting codes and can be used to detect single errors. The parity bit is an example of a single-error-detecting code.

== Applications ==
Applications that require low latency (such as telephone conversations) cannot use automatic repeat request (ARQ); they must use forward error correction (FEC). By the time an ARQ system discovers an error and re-transmits it, the re-sent data will arrive too late to be usable.

Applications where the transmitter immediately forgets the information as soon as it is sent (such as most television cameras) cannot use ARQ; they must use FEC because when an error occurs, the original data is no longer available.

Applications that use ARQ must have a return channel; applications having no return channel cannot use ARQ.

Applications that require extremely low error rates (such as digital money transfers) must use ARQ due to the possibility of uncorrectable errors with FEC.

Reliability and inspection engineering also make use of the theory of error-correcting codes.

=== Internet ===
In a typical TCP/IP stack, error control is performed at multiple levels:
* Each Ethernet frame uses CRC-32 error detection. Frames with detected errors are discarded by the receiver hardware.
* The IPv4 header contains a checksum protecting the contents of the header. Packets with incorrect checksums are dropped within the network or at the receiver.
* The checksum was omitted from the IPv6 header in order to minimize processing costs in network routing and because current link layer technology is assumed to provide sufficient error detection (see also RFC 3819).
* UDP has an optional checksum covering the payload and addressing information in the UDP and IP headers. Packets with incorrect checksums are discarded by the network stack. The checksum is optional under IPv4, and required under IPv6. When omitted, it is assumed the data-link layer provides the desired level of error protection.
* TCP provides a checksum for protecting the payload and addressing information in the TCP and IP headers. Packets with incorrect checksums are discarded by the network stack and eventually get retransmitted using ARQ, either explicitly (such as through three-way handshake) or implicitly due to a timeout.

=== Deep-space telecommunications ===
The development of error-correction codes was tightly coupled with the history of deep-space missions due to the extreme dilution of signal power over interplanetary distances, and the limited power availability aboard space probes. Whereas early missions sent their data uncoded, starting in 1968, digital error correction was implemented in the form of (sub-optimally decoded) convolutional codes and Reed–Muller codes. The Reed–Muller code was well suited to the noise the spacecraft was subject to (approximately matching a bell curve), and was implemented for the Mariner spacecraft and used on missions between 1969 and 1977.

The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 missions, which started in 1977, were designed to deliver color imaging and scientific information from Jupiter and Saturn. This resulted in increased coding requirements, and thus, the spacecraft were supported by (optimally Viterbi-decoded) convolutional codes that could be concatenated with an outer Golay (24,12,8) code. The Voyager 2 craft additionally supported an implementation of a Reed–Solomon code. The concatenated Reed–Solomon–Viterbi (RSV) code allowed for very powerful error correction, and enabled the spacecraft&#x27;s extended journey to Uranus and Neptune. After ECC system upgrades in 1989, both crafts used V2 RSV coding.

The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems currently recommends usage of error correction codes with performance similar to the Voyager 2 RSV code as a minimum. Concatenated codes are increasingly falling out of favor with space missions, and are replaced by more powerful codes such as Turbo codes or LDPC codes.

The different kinds of deep space and orbital missions that are conducted suggest that trying to find a one-size-fits-all error correction system will be an ongoing problem. For missions close to Earth, the nature of the noise in the communication channel is different from that which a spacecraft on an interplanetary mission experiences. Additionally, as a spacecraft increases its distance from Earth, the problem of correcting for noise becomes more difficult.

=== Satellite broadcasting ===
The demand for satellite transponder bandwidth continues to grow, fueled by the desire to deliver television (including new channels and high-definition television) and IP data. Transponder availability and bandwidth constraints have limited this growth. Transponder capacity is determined by the selected modulation scheme and the proportion of capacity consumed by FEC.

=== Data storage ===
Error detection and correction codes are often used to improve the reliability of data storage media. A parity track capable of detecting single-bit errors was present on the first magnetic tape data storage in 1951. The optimal rectangular code used in group coded recording tapes not only detects but also corrects single-bit errors. Some file formats, particularly archive formats, include a checksum (most often CRC32) to detect corruption and truncation and can employ redundancy or parity files to recover portions of corrupted data. Reed-Solomon codes are used in compact discs to correct errors caused by scratches.

Modern hard drives use Reed–Solomon codes to detect and correct minor errors in sector reads, and to recover corrupted data from failing sectors and store that data in the spare sectors. RAID systems use a variety of error correction techniques to recover data when a hard drive completely fails. Filesystems such as ZFS or Btrfs, as well as some RAID implementations, support data scrubbing and resilvering, which allows bad blocks to be detected and (hopefully) recovered before they are used. The recovered data may be re-written to exactly the same physical location, to spare blocks elsewhere on the same piece of hardware, or the data may be rewritten onto replacement hardware.

=== Error-correcting memory ===
Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) may provide stronger protection against soft errors by relying on error-correcting codes. Such error-correcting memory, known as &quot;ECC&quot; or &quot;EDAC-protected&quot; memory, is particularly desirable for mission-critical applications, such as scientific computing, financial, medical, etc. as well as extraterrestrial applications due to the increased radiation in space.

Error-correcting memory controllers traditionally use Hamming codes, although some use triple modular redundancy. Interleaving allows distributing the effect of a single cosmic ray potentially upsetting multiple physically neighboring bits across multiple words by associating neighboring bits to different words. As long as a single-event upset (SEU) does not exceed the error threshold (e.g., a single error) in any particular word between accesses, it can be corrected (e.g., by a single-bit error-correcting code), and the illusion of an error-free memory system may be maintained.

In addition to hardware providing features required for ECC memory to operate, operating systems usually contain related reporting facilities that are used to provide notifications when soft errors are transparently recovered. One example is the Linux kernel&#x27;s &quot;EDAC&quot; subsystem (previously known as &quot;Bluesmoke&quot;), which collects the data from error-checking-enabled components inside a computer system; besides collecting and reporting back the events related to ECC memory, it also supports other checksumming errors, including those detected on the PCI bus. A few systems also support memory scrubbing to catch and correct errors early before they become unrecoverable.

<doc id="10376" wikidata="Q867345" url="?curid=10376" title="Euclidean domain">
<text>In mathematics, more specifically in ring theory, a Euclidean domain (also called a Euclidean ring) is an integral domain that can be endowed with a Euclidean function which allows a suitable generalization of Euclidean division of integers. This generalized Euclidean algorithm can be put to many of the same uses as Euclid&#x27;s original algorithm in the ring of integers: in any Euclidean domain, one can apply the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of any two elements. In particular, the greatest common divisor of any two elements exists and can be written as a linear combination 
of them (Bézout&#x27;s identity). In particular, the existence of efficient algorithms for Euclidean division of integers and of polynomials in one variable over a field is of basic importance in computer algebra.

It is important to compare the class of Euclidean domains with the larger class of principal ideal domains (PIDs). An arbitrary PID has much the same &quot;structural properties&quot; of a Euclidean domain (or, indeed, even of the ring of integers), but lacks an analogue of the Euclidean algorithm and extended Euclidean algorithm to compute greatest common divisors. So, given an integral domain , it is often very useful to know that has a Euclidean function: in particular, this implies that is a PID. However, if there is no &quot;obvious&quot; Euclidean function, then determining whether is a PID is generally a much easier problem than determining whether it is a Euclidean domain.

Every ideal in a Euclidean domain is principal, which implies a suitable generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every Euclidean domain is also a unique factorization domain. Euclidean domains appear in the following chain of class inclusions:

==Definition==
Let be an integral domain. A Euclidean function on is a function from to the non-negative integers satisfying the following fundamental division-with-remainder property:

*(EF1) If and are in and is nonzero, then there exist and in such that and either or .

A Euclidean domain is an integral domain which can be endowed with at least one Euclidean function. A particular Euclidean function is &quot;not&quot; part of the definition of a Euclidean domain, as, in general, a Euclidean domain may admit many different Euclidean functions.

In this context, and are called respectively a &quot;quotient&quot; and a &quot;remainder&quot; of the &quot;division&quot; (or &quot;Euclidean division&quot;) of by . In contrast with the case of integers and polynomials, the quotient is generally not uniquely defined, but when a quotient has been chosen, the remainder is uniquely defined. 

Most algebra texts require a Euclidean function to have the following additional property:

*(EF2) For all nonzero and in , .

However, one can show that (EF1) alone suffices to define a Euclidean domain; if an integral domain is endowed with a function satisfying (EF1), then can also be endowed with a function satisfying both (EF1) and (EF2) simultaneously. Indeed, for in , one can define as follows:

:formula_1

In words, one may define to be the minimum value attained by on the set of all non-zero elements of the principal ideal generated by .

A Euclidean function is multiplicative if and is never zero. It follows that . More generally, if and only if is a unit.

=== Notes on the definition ===

Many authors use other terms in place of &quot;Euclidean function&quot;, such as &quot;degree function&quot;, &quot;valuation function&quot;, &quot;gauge function&quot; or &quot;norm function&quot;. Some authors also require the domain of the Euclidean function to be the entire ring ; however, this does not essentially affect the definition, since (EF1) does not involve the value of . The definition is sometimes generalized by allowing the Euclidean function to take its values in any well-ordered set; this weakening does not affect the most important implications of the Euclidean property.

The property (EF1) can be restated as follows: for any principal ideal of with nonzero generator , all nonzero classes of the quotient ring have a representative with . Since the possible values of are well-ordered, this property can be established by showing that for any with minimal value of in its class. Note that, for a Euclidean function that is so established, there need not exist an effective method to determine and in (EF1).

==Examples==
Examples of Euclidean domains include:

*Any field. Define for all nonzero .
*, the ring of integers. Define , the absolute value of .
*, the ring of Gaussian integers. Define , the norm of the Gaussian integer .
* (where is a primitive (non-real) cube root of unity), the ring of Eisenstein integers. Define , the norm of the Eisenstein integer .
*, the ring of polynomials over a field . For each nonzero polynomial , define to be the degree of .
*, the ring of formal power series over the field . For each nonzero power series , define as the order of , that is the degree of the smallest power of occurring in . In particular, for two nonzero power series and , if and only if divides .
*Any discrete valuation ring. Define to be the highest power of the maximal ideal containing . Equivalently, let be a generator of , and be the unique integer such that is an associate of , then define . The previous example is a special case of this.
*A Dedekind domain with finitely many nonzero prime ideals . Define formula_2, where is the discrete valuation corresponding to the ideal .

Examples of domains that are &quot;not&quot; Euclidean domains include:
* Every domain that is not a principal ideal domain, such as the ring of polynomials in at least two indeterminates over a field, or the ring of univariate polynomials with integer coefficients, or the number ring .
* The ring of integers of , consisting of the numbers where and are integers and both even or both odd. It is a principal ideal domain that is not Euclidean.This was proved by Theodore Motzkin and was the first case known.
* The ring is also a principal ideal domain that is not Euclidean. To see that it is not a Euclidean domain, it suffices to show that for every non-zero prime formula_3, the map formula_4 induced by the quotient map formula_5 is not surjective.
==Properties==
Let &quot;R&quot; be a domain and &quot;f&quot; a Euclidean function on &quot;R&quot;. Then:

* &quot;R&quot; is a principal ideal domain (PID). In fact, if &quot;I&quot; is a nonzero ideal of &quot;R&quot; then any element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;I&quot; \ {0} with minimal value (on that set) of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) is a generator of &quot;I&quot;. As a consequence &quot;R&quot; is also a unique factorization domain and a Noetherian ring. With respect to general principal ideal domains, the existence of factorizations (i.e., that &quot;R&quot; is an atomic domain) is particularly easy to prove in Euclidean domains: choosing a Euclidean function &quot;f&quot; satisfying (EF2), &quot;x&quot; cannot have any decomposition into more than &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) nonunit factors, so starting with &quot;x&quot; and repeatedly decomposing reducible factors is bound to produce a factorization into irreducible elements.
* Any element of &quot;R&quot; at which &quot;f&quot; takes its globally minimal value is invertible in &quot;R&quot;. If an &quot;f&quot; satisfying (EF2) is chosen, then the converse also holds, and &quot;f&quot; takes its minimal value exactly at the invertible elements of &quot;R&quot;.
*If Euclidean division is algorithmic, that is, if there is an algorithm for computing the quotient and the remainder, then an extended Euclidean algorithm can be defined exactly as in the case of integers.
*If a Euclidean domain is not a field then it has an element &quot;a&quot; with the following property: any element &quot;x&quot; not divisible by &quot;a&quot; can be written as &quot;x&quot; = &quot;ay&quot; + &quot;u&quot; for some unit &quot;u&quot; and some element &quot;y&quot;. This follows by taking &quot;a&quot; to be a non-unit with &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) as small as possible. This strange property can be used to show that some principal ideal domains are not Euclidean domains, as not all PIDs have this property. For example, for &quot;d&quot; = −19, −43, −67, −163, the ring of integers of formula_6 is a PID which is Euclidean, but the cases &quot;d&quot; = −1, −2, −3, −7, −11 Euclidean.

However, in many finite extensions of Q with trivial class group, the ring of integers is Euclidean (not necessarily with respect to the absolute value of the field norm; see below).
Assuming the extended Riemann hypothesis, if &quot;K&quot; is a finite extension of Q and the ring of integers of &quot;K&quot; is a PID with an infinite number of units, then the ring of integers is Euclidean.
In particular this applies to the case of totally real quadratic number fields with trivial class group.
In addition (and without assuming ERH), if the field &quot;K&quot; is a Galois extension of Q, has trivial class group and unit rank strictly greater than three, then the ring of integers is Euclidean.
An immediate corollary of this is that if the number field is Galois over Q, its class group is trivial and the extension has degree greater than 8 then the ring of integers is necessarily Euclidean.
== Norm-Euclidean fields ==

Algebraic number fields &quot;K&quot; come with a canonical norm function on them: the absolute value of the field norm &quot;N&quot; that takes an algebraic element &quot;α&quot; to the product of all the conjugates of &quot;α&quot;. This norm maps the ring of integers of a number field &quot;K&quot;, say &quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot;, to the nonnegative rational integers, so it is a candidate to be a Euclidean norm on this ring. If this norm satisfies the axioms of a Euclidean function then the number field &quot;K&quot; is called &quot;norm-Euclidean&quot; or simply &quot;Euclidean&quot;. Strictly speaking it is the ring of integers that is Euclidean since fields are trivially Euclidean domains, but the terminology is standard.

If a field is not norm-Euclidean then that does not mean the ring of integers is not Euclidean, just that the field norm does not satisfy the axioms of a Euclidean function. In fact, the rings of integers of number fields may be divided in several classes:
*Those that are not principal and therefore not Euclidean, such as the integers of formula_7
*Those that are principal and not Euclidean, such as the integers of formula_8
*Those that are Euclidean and not norm-Euclidean, such as the integers of formula_9
*Those that are norm-Euclidean, such as Gaussian integers (integers of formula_10)

The norm-Euclidean quadratic fields have been fully classified; they are formula_6 where formula_12 takes the values
:−11, −7, −3, −2, −1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73 .

Every Euclidean imaginary quadratic field is norm-Euclidean and is one of the five first fields in the preceding list.

<doc id="10377" wikidata="Q230848" url="?curid=10377" title="Euclidean algorithm">
<text>In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm, or Euclid&#x27;s algorithm, is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, the largest number that divides them both without a remainder. It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, who first described it in his &quot;Elements&quot; ().
It is an example of an &quot;algorithm&quot;, a step-by-step procedure for performing a calculation according to well-defined rules,
and is one of the oldest algorithms in common use. It can be used to reduce fractions to their simplest form, and is a part of many other number-theoretic and cryptographic calculations.

The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number. For example, is the GCD of and (as and , and the same number is also the GCD of and . Since this replacement reduces the larger of the two numbers, repeating this process gives successively smaller pairs of numbers until the two numbers become equal. When that occurs, that number is the GCD of the original two numbers. By reversing the steps or using the extended Euclidean algorithm, the GCD can be expressed as a linear combination of the two original numbers, that is the sum of the two numbers, each multiplied by an integer (for example, ). The fact that the GCD can always be expressed in this way is known as Bézout&#x27;s identity.

The version of the Euclidean algorithm described above—which follows Euclid&#x27;s original presentation—may require many subtraction steps to find the GCD when one of the given numbers is much bigger than the other. A more efficient version of the algorithm shortcuts these steps, instead replacing the larger of the two numbers by its remainder when divided by the smaller of the two (with this version, the algorithm stops when reaching a zero remainder). With this improvement, the algorithm never requires more steps than five times the number of digits (base 10) of the smaller integer. This was proven by Gabriel Lamé in 1844 (Lamé&#x27;s Theorem), and marks the beginning of computational complexity theory. Additional methods for improving the algorithm&#x27;s efficiency were developed in the 20th century.

The Euclidean algorithm has many theoretical and practical applications. It is used for reducing fractions to their simplest form and for performing division in modular arithmetic. Computations using this algorithm form part of the cryptographic protocols that are used to secure internet communications, and in methods for breaking these cryptosystems by factoring large composite numbers. The Euclidean algorithm may be used to solve Diophantine equations, such as finding numbers that satisfy multiple congruences according to the Chinese remainder theorem, to construct continued fractions, and to find accurate rational approximations to real numbers. Finally, it can be used as a basic tool for proving theorems in number theory such as Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem and the uniqueness of prime factorizations.

The original algorithm was described only for natural numbers and geometric lengths (real numbers), but the algorithm was generalized in the 19th century to other types of numbers, such as Gaussian integers and polynomials of one variable. This led to modern abstract algebraic notions such as Euclidean domains.

== Background: greatest common divisor ==
The Euclidean algorithm calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two natural numbers and . The greatest common divisor is the largest natural number that divides both and without leaving a remainder. Synonyms for GCD include &quot;greatest common factor&quot; (GCF), &quot;highest common factor&quot; (HCF), &quot;highest common divisor&quot; (HCD), and &quot;greatest common measure&quot; (GCM). The greatest common divisor is often written as or, more simply, as , although the latter notation is ambiguous, also used for concepts such as an ideal in the ring of integers, which is closely related to GCD.

If , then and are said to be coprime (or relatively prime). This property does not imply that or are themselves prime numbers. For example, and factor as and , so they are not prime, but their prime factors are different, so and are coprime, with no common factors other than .

Let . Since and are both multiples of , they can be written and , and there is no larger number for which this is true. The natural numbers and must be coprime, since any common factor could be factored out of and to make greater. Thus, any other number that divides both and must also divide . The greatest common divisor of and is the unique (positive) common divisor of and that is divisible by any other common divisor .

The greatest common divisor can be visualized as follows. Consider a rectangular area by , and any common divisor that divides both and exactly. The sides of the rectangle can be divided into segments of length , which divides the rectangle into a grid of squares of side length . The GCD is the largest value of for which this is possible. For illustration, a rectangular area can be divided into a grid of: squares, squares, squares, squares, squares or squares. Therefore, is the GCD of and . A rectangular area can be divided into a grid of squares, with two squares along one edge () and five squares along the other ().

The greatest common divisor of two numbers and is the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers, where each prime factor can be repeated as many times as it divides both and . For example, since can be factored into , and can be factored into , the GCD of and equals , the product of their shared prime factors (with 3 repeated since divides both). If two numbers have no common prime factors, their GCD is (obtained here as an instance of the empty product); in other words, they are coprime. A key advantage of the Euclidean algorithm is that it can find the GCD efficiently without having to compute the prime factors. Factorization of large integers is believed to be a computationally very difficult problem, and the security of many widely used cryptographic protocols is based upon its infeasibility.

Another definition of the GCD is helpful in advanced mathematics, particularly ring theory. The greatest common divisor of two nonzero numbers and is also their smallest positive integral linear combination, that is, the smallest positive number of the form where and are integers. The set of all integral linear combinations of and is actually the same as the set of all multiples of (, where is an integer). In modern mathematical language, the ideal generated by and is the ideal generated by  alone (an ideal generated by a single element is called a principal ideal, and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals). Some properties of the GCD are in fact easier to see with this description, for instance the fact that any common divisor of and also divides the GCD (it divides both terms of ). The equivalence of this GCD definition with the other definitions is described below.

The GCD of three or more numbers equals the product of the prime factors common to all the numbers, but it can also be calculated by repeatedly taking the GCDs of pairs of numbers. For example,

Thus, Euclid&#x27;s algorithm, which computes the GCD of two integers, suffices to calculate the GCD of arbitrarily many integers.

=== Procedure ===

The Euclidean algorithm can be thought of as constructing a sequence of non-negative integers that begins with the two given integers formula_1 and formula_2 and will eventually terminate with the integer zero: formula_3 with formula_4. The integer formula_5 will then be the GCD and we can state formula_6. The algorithm indicates how to construct the intermediate remainders formula_7 via division-with-remainder on the preceding pair formula_8 by finding an integer quotient formula_9 so that:
: formula_10

Because the sequence of non-negative integers formula_11 is strictly decreasing, it eventually must terminate. In other words, since formula_12 for every formula_13, and each formula_7 is an integer that is strictly smaller than the preceding formula_15, there eventually cannot be a non-negative integer smaller than zero, and hence the algorithm must terminate. In fact, the algorithm will always terminate at the th step with formula_16 equal to zero.

To illustrate, suppose the GCD of 1071 and 462 is requested. The sequence is initially formula_17 and in order to find formula_18, we need to find integers formula_19 and formula_20 such that:
: formula_21.

This is the quotient formula_22 since formula_23. This determines formula_24 and so the sequence is now formula_25. The next step is to continue the sequence to find formula_26 by finding integers formula_27 and formula_28 such that:
: formula_29.

This is the quotient formula_30 since formula_31. This determines formula_32 and so the sequence is now formula_33. The next step is to continue the sequence to find formula_34 by finding integers formula_35 and formula_36 such that:
: formula_37.

This is the quotient formula_38 since formula_39. This determines formula_40 and so the sequence is completed as formula_41 as no further non-negative integer smaller than formula_42 can be found. The penultimate remainder formula_43 is therefore the requested GCD:
: formula_44

We can generalize slightly by dropping any ordering requirement on the initial two values formula_45 and formula_46. If formula_47, the algorithm may continue and trivially find that formula_48 as the sequence of remainders will be formula_49. If formula_50, then we can also continue since formula_51, suggesting the next remainder should be formula_45 itself, and the sequence is formula_53. Normally, this would be invalid because it breaks the requirement formula_20 but now we have formula_50 by construction, so the requirement is automatically satisfied and the Euclidean algorithm can continue as normal. Therefore, dropping any ordering between the first two integers does not affect the conclusion that the sequence must eventually terminate because the next remainder will always satisfy formula_56 and everything continues as above. The only modifications that need to be made are that formula_57 only for formula_58, and that the sub-sequence of non-negative integers formula_59 for formula_58 is strictly decreasing, therefore excluding formula_61 from both statements.

=== Proof of validity ===
The validity of the Euclidean algorithm can be proven by a two-step argument. In the first step, the final nonzero remainder is shown to divide both and . Since it is a common divisor, it must be less than or equal to the greatest common divisor . In the second step, it is shown that any common divisor of and , including , must divide ; therefore, must be less than or equal to . These two opposite inequalities imply .

To demonstrate that divides both and (the first step), divides its predecessor 
since the final remainder is zero. also divides its next predecessor 
because it divides both terms on the right-hand side of the equation. Iterating the same argument, divides all the preceding remainders, including and . None of the preceding remainders , , etc. divide and , since they leave a remainder. Since is a common divisor of and , .

In the second step, any natural number that divides both and (in other words, any common divisor of and ) divides the remainders . By definition, and can be written as multiples of : and , where and are natural numbers. Therefore, divides the initial remainder , since . An analogous argument shows that also divides the subsequent remainders , , etc. Therefore, the greatest common divisor must divide , which implies that . Since the first part of the argument showed the reverse (), it follows that . Thus, is the greatest common divisor of all the succeeding pairs:

=== Worked example ===
For illustration, the Euclidean algorithm can be used to find the greatest common divisor of and . To begin, multiples of are subtracted from until the remainder is less than . Two such multiples can be subtracted (), leaving a remainder of :

Then multiples of are subtracted from until the remainder is less than . Three multiples can be subtracted (), leaving a remainder of :

Then multiples of are subtracted from until the remainder is less than . Seven multiples can be subtracted (), leaving no remainder:

Since the last remainder is zero, the algorithm ends with as the greatest common divisor of and . This agrees with the found by prime factorization above. In tabular form, the steps are:

=== Visualization ===
The Euclidean algorithm can be visualized in terms of the tiling analogy given above for the greatest common divisor. Assume that we wish to cover an rectangle with square tiles exactly, where is the larger of the two numbers. We first attempt to tile the rectangle using square tiles; however, this leaves an residual rectangle untiled, where . We then attempt to tile the residual rectangle with square tiles. This leaves a second residual rectangle , which we attempt to tile using square tiles, and so on. The sequence ends when there is no residual rectangle, i.e., when the square tiles cover the previous residual rectangle exactly. The length of the sides of the smallest square tile is the GCD of the dimensions of the original rectangle. For example, the smallest square tile in the adjacent figure is (shown in red), and is the GCD of and , the dimensions of the original rectangle (shown in green).

=== Euclidean division ===
At every step , the Euclidean algorithm computes a quotient and remainder from two numbers and 
where the is non-negative and is strictly less than the absolute value of . The theorem which underlies the definition of the Euclidean division ensures that such a quotient and remainder always exist and are unique.

In Euclid&#x27;s original version of the algorithm, the quotient and remainder are found by repeated subtraction; that is, is subtracted from repeatedly until the remainder is smaller than . After that and are exchanged and the process is iterated. Euclidean division reduces all the steps between two exchanges into a single step, which is thus more efficient. Moreover, the quotients are not needed, thus one may replace Euclidean division by the modulo operation, which gives only the remainder. Thus the iteration of the Euclidean algorithm becomes simply

=== Implementations ===
Implementations of the algorithm may be expressed in pseudocode. For example, the division-based version may be programmed as

 function gcd(a, b)
 while b ≠ 0
 t := b
 b := a mod b
 a := t
 return a

At the beginning of the th iteration, the variable holds the latest remainder , whereas the variable holds its predecessor, . The step is equivalent to the above recursion formula . The temporary variable holds the value of while the next remainder is being calculated. At the end of the loop iteration, the variable holds the remainder , whereas the variable holds its predecessor, .

(If negative inputs are allowed, or if the codice_1 function may return negative values, the last line must be replaced with .)

In the subtraction-based version, which was Euclid&#x27;s original version, the remainder calculation () is replaced by repeated subtraction. Contrary to the division-based version, which works with arbitrary integers as input, the subtraction-based version supposes that the input consists of positive integers and stops when :

 function gcd(a, b)
 while a ≠ b 
 if a &gt; b
 a := a − b
 else
 b := b − a
 return a

The variables and alternate holding the previous remainders and . Assume that is larger than at the beginning of an iteration; then equals , since . During the loop iteration, is reduced by multiples of the previous remainder until is smaller than . Then is the next remainder . Then is reduced by multiples of until it is again smaller than , giving the next remainder , and so on.

The recursive version is based on the equality of the GCDs of successive remainders and the stopping condition .

 function gcd(a, b)
 if b = 0
 return a
 else
 return gcd(b, a mod b)

(As above, if negative inputs are allowed, or if the codice_1 function may return negative values, the instruction must be replaced by .)

For illustration, the is calculated from the equivalent . The latter GCD is calculated from the , which in turn is calculated from the .

=== Method of least absolute remainders ===
In another version of Euclid&#x27;s algorithm, the quotient at each step is increased by one if the resulting negative remainder is smaller in magnitude than the typical positive remainder. Previously, the equation
assumed that . However, an alternative negative remainder can be computed:
if or
if .

If is replaced by . when , then one gets a variant of Euclidean algorithm such that
at each step.

Leopold Kronecker has shown that this version requires the fewest steps of any version of Euclid&#x27;s algorithm. More generally, it has been proven that, for every input numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, the number of steps is minimal if and only if is chosen in order that formula_62 where formula_63 is the golden ratio.

== Historical development ==
The Euclidean algorithm is one of the oldest algorithms in common use. It appears in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; (c. 300 BC), specifically in Book 7 (Propositions 1–2) and Book 10 (Propositions 2–3). In Book 7, the algorithm is formulated for integers, whereas in Book 10, it is formulated for lengths of line segments. (In modern usage, one would say it was formulated there for real numbers. But lengths, areas, and volumes, represented as real numbers in modern usage, are not measured in the same units and there is no natural unit of length, area, or volume; the concept of real numbers was unknown at that time.) The latter algorithm is geometrical. The GCD of two lengths and corresponds to the greatest length that measures and evenly; in other words, the lengths and are both integer multiples of the length .

The algorithm was probably not discovered by Euclid, who compiled results from earlier mathematicians in his &quot;Elements&quot;. The mathematician and historian B. L. van der Waerden suggests that Book VII derives from a textbook on number theory written by mathematicians in the school of Pythagoras. The algorithm was probably known by Eudoxus of Cnidus (about 375 BC). The algorithm may even pre-date Eudoxus, judging from the use of the technical term ἀνθυφαίρεσις (&quot;anthyphairesis&quot;, reciprocal subtraction) in works by Euclid and Aristotle. Claude Brezinski, following remarks by Pappus of Alexandria, credits the algorithm to Theaetetus (c. 417 – c. 369 BC).

Centuries later, Euclid&#x27;s algorithm was discovered independently both in India and in China, primarily to solve Diophantine equations that arose in astronomy and making accurate calendars. In the late 5th century, the Indian mathematician and astronomer Aryabhata described the algorithm as the &quot;pulverizer&quot;, perhaps because of its effectiveness in solving Diophantine equations. Although a special case of the Chinese remainder theorem had already been described in the Chinese book &quot;Sunzi Suanjing&quot;, the general solution was published by Qin Jiushao in his 1247 book &quot;Shushu Jiuzhang&quot; (數書九章 &quot;Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections&quot;). The Euclidean algorithm was first described &quot;numerically&quot; and popularized in Europe in the second edition of Bachet&#x27;s &quot;Problèmes plaisants et délectables&quot; (&quot;Pleasant and enjoyable problems&quot;, 1624). In Europe, it was likewise used to solve Diophantine equations and in developing continued fractions. The extended Euclidean algorithm was published by the English mathematician Nicholas Saunderson, who attributed it to Roger Cotes as a method for computing continued fractions efficiently.

In the 19th century, the Euclidean algorithm led to the development of new number systems, such as Gaussian integers and Eisenstein integers. In 1815, Carl Gauss used the Euclidean algorithm to demonstrate unique factorization of Gaussian integers, although his work was first published in 1832. Gauss mentioned the algorithm in his &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; (published 1801), but only as a method for continued fractions. Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet seems to have been the first to describe the Euclidean algorithm as the basis for much of number theory. Lejeune Dirichlet noted that many results of number theory, such as unique factorization, would hold true for any other system of numbers to which the Euclidean algorithm could be applied. Lejeune Dirichlet&#x27;s lectures on number theory were edited and extended by Richard Dedekind, who used Euclid&#x27;s algorithm to study algebraic integers, a new general type of number. For example, Dedekind was the first to prove Fermat&#x27;s two-square theorem using the unique factorization of Gaussian integers. Dedekind also defined the concept of a Euclidean domain, a number system in which a generalized version of the Euclidean algorithm can be defined (as described below). In the closing decades of the 19th century, the Euclidean algorithm gradually became eclipsed by Dedekind&#x27;s more general theory of ideals.

Other applications of Euclid&#x27;s algorithm were developed in the 19th century. In 1829, Charles Sturm showed that the algorithm was useful in the Sturm chain method for counting the real roots of polynomials in any given interval.

The Euclidean algorithm was the first integer relation algorithm, which is a method for finding integer relations between commensurate real numbers. Several novel integer relation algorithms have been developed, such as the algorithm of Helaman Ferguson and R.W. Forcade (1979) and the LLL algorithm.

In 1969, Cole and Davie developed a two-player game based on the Euclidean algorithm, called &quot;The Game of Euclid&quot;, which has an optimal strategy. The players begin with two piles of and stones. The players take turns removing multiples of the smaller pile from the larger. Thus, if the two piles consist of and stones, where is larger than , the next player can reduce the larger pile from stones to stones, as long as the latter is a nonnegative integer. The winner is the first player to reduce one pile to zero stones.

== Mathematical applications ==

=== Bézout&#x27;s identity ===

Bézout&#x27;s identity states that the greatest common divisor of two integers and can be represented as a linear sum of the original two numbers and . In other words, it is always possible to find integers and such that .

The integers and can be calculated from the quotients , , etc. by reversing the order of equations in Euclid&#x27;s algorithm. Beginning with the next-to-last equation, can be expressed in terms of the quotient and the two preceding remainders, and :

Those two remainders can be likewise expressed in terms of their quotients and preceding remainders,
: and

Substituting these formulae for and into the first equation yields as a linear sum of the remainders and . The process of substituting remainders by formulae involving their predecessors can be continued until the original numbers and are reached:
: 

After all the remainders , , etc. have been substituted, the final equation expresses as a linear sum of and , so that .

The Euclidean algorithm, and thus Bézout&#x27;s identity, can be generalized to the context of Euclidean domains.

=== Principal ideals and related problems ===
Bézout&#x27;s identity provides yet another definition of the greatest common divisor of two numbers and . Consider the set of all numbers , where and are any two integers. Since and are both divisible by , every number in the set is divisible by . In other words, every number of the set is an integer multiple of . This is true for every common divisor of and . However, unlike other common divisors, the greatest common divisor is a member of the set; by Bézout&#x27;s identity, choosing and gives . A smaller common divisor cannot be a member of the set, since every member of the set must be divisible by . Conversely, any multiple of can be obtained by choosing and , where and are the integers of Bézout&#x27;s identity. This may be seen by multiplying Bézout&#x27;s identity by &quot;m&quot;,

Therefore, the set of all numbers is equivalent to the set of multiples of . In other words, the set of all possible sums of integer multiples of two numbers ( and ) is equivalent to the set of multiples of . The GCD is said to be the generator of the ideal of and . This GCD definition led to the modern abstract algebraic concepts of a principal ideal (an ideal generated by a single element) and a principal ideal domain (a domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal).

Certain problems can be solved using this result. For example, consider two measuring cups of volume and . By adding/subtracting multiples of the first cup and multiples of the second cup, any volume can be measured out. These volumes are all multiples of .

=== Extended Euclidean algorithm ===
The integers and of Bézout&#x27;s identity can be computed efficiently using the extended Euclidean algorithm. This extension adds two recursive equations to Euclid&#x27;s algorithm
: 
with the starting values
: .

Using this recursion, Bézout&#x27;s integers and are given by and , where is the step on which the algorithm terminates with .

The validity of this approach can be shown by induction. Assume that the recursion formula is correct up to step of the algorithm; in other words, assume that
for all less than . The th step of the algorithm gives the equation

Since the recursion formula has been assumed to be correct for and , they may be expressed in terms of the corresponding and variables

Rearranging this equation yields the recursion formula for step , as required

=== Matrix method ===

The integers and can also be found using an equivalent matrix method. The sequence of equations of Euclid&#x27;s algorithm
: formula_64
can be written as a product of quotient matrices multiplying a two-dimensional remainder vector

: formula_65

Let represent the product of all the quotient matrices

: formula_66

This simplifies the Euclidean algorithm to the form

: formula_67

To express as a linear sum of and , both sides of this equation can be multiplied by the inverse of the matrix . The determinant of equals , since it equals the product of the determinants of the quotient matrices, each of which is negative one. Since the determinant of is never zero, the vector of the final remainders can be solved using the inverse of 

: formula_68

Since the top equation gives
the two integers of Bézout&#x27;s identity are and . The matrix method is as efficient as the equivalent recursion, with two multiplications and two additions per step of the Euclidean algorithm.

=== Euclid&#x27;s lemma and unique factorization ===
Bézout&#x27;s identity is essential to many applications of Euclid&#x27;s algorithm, such as demonstrating the unique factorization of numbers into prime factors. To illustrate this, suppose that a number can be written as a product of two factors and , that is, . If another number also divides but is coprime with , then must divide , by the following argument: If the greatest common divisor of and is , then integers and can be found such that
by Bézout&#x27;s identity. Multiplying both sides by gives the relation:

Since divides both terms on the right-hand side, it must also divide the left-hand side, . This result is known as Euclid&#x27;s lemma. Specifically, if a prime number divides , then it must divide at least one factor of . Conversely, if a number is coprime to each of a series of numbers , , ..., , then is also coprime to their product, .

Euclid&#x27;s lemma suffices to prove that every number has a unique factorization into prime numbers. To see this, assume the contrary, that there are two independent factorizations of into and prime factors, respectively

Since each prime divides by assumption, it must also divide one of the factors; since each is prime as well, it must be that . Iteratively dividing by the factors shows that each has an equal counterpart ; the two prime factorizations are identical except for their order. The unique factorization of numbers into primes has many applications in mathematical proofs, as shown below.

=== Linear Diophantine equations ===
Diophantine equations are equations in which the solutions are restricted to integers; they are named after the 3rd-century Alexandrian mathematician Diophantus. A typical &quot;linear&quot; Diophantine equation seeks integers and such that
where , and are given integers. This can be written as an equation for in modular arithmetic:

Let be the greatest common divisor of and . Both terms in are divisible by ; therefore, must also be divisible by , or the equation has no solutions. By dividing both sides by , the equation can be reduced to Bezout&#x27;s identity
where and can be found by the extended Euclidean algorithm. This provides one solution to the Diophantine equation, and .

In general, a linear Diophantine equation has no solutions, or an infinite number of solutions. To find the latter, consider two solutions, and , where
or equivalently

Therefore, the smallest difference between two solutions is , whereas the smallest difference between two solutions is . Thus, the solutions may be expressed as
: .

By allowing to vary over all possible integers, an infinite family of solutions can be generated from a single solution . If the solutions are required to be &quot;positive&quot; integers , only a finite number of solutions may be possible. This restriction on the acceptable solutions allows some systems of Diophantine equations with more unknowns than equations to have a finite number of solutions; this is impossible for a system of linear equations when the solutions can be any real number (see Underdetermined system).

=== Multiplicative inverses and the RSA algorithm ===
A finite field is a set of numbers with four generalized operations. The operations are called addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and have their usual properties, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity. An example of a finite field is the set of 13 numbers using modular arithmetic. In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) is reduced modulo ; that is, multiples of are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range –. For example, the result of . Such finite fields can be defined for any prime ; using more sophisticated definitions, they can also be defined for any power of a prime . Finite fields are often called Galois fields, and are abbreviated as or ).

In such a field with numbers, every nonzero element has a unique modular multiplicative inverse, such that . This inverse can be found by solving the congruence equation , or the equivalent linear Diophantine equation

This equation can be solved by the Euclidean algorithm, as described above. Finding multiplicative inverses is an essential step in the RSA algorithm, which is widely used in electronic commerce; specifically, the equation determines the integer used to decrypt the message. Although the RSA algorithm uses rings rather than fields, the Euclidean algorithm can still be used to find a multiplicative inverse where one exists. The Euclidean algorithm also has other applications in error-correcting codes; for example, it can be used as an alternative to the Berlekamp–Massey algorithm for decoding BCH and Reed–Solomon codes, which are based on Galois fields.

=== Chinese remainder theorem ===
Euclid&#x27;s algorithm can also be used to solve multiple linear Diophantine equations. Such equations arise in the Chinese remainder theorem, which describes a novel method to represent an integer &quot;x&quot;. Instead of representing an integer by its digits, it may be represented by its remainders &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; modulo a set of &quot;N&quot; coprime numbers &quot;m&quot;&quot;i&quot;:
: formula_69

The goal is to determine &quot;x&quot; from its &quot;N&quot; remainders &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;. The solution is to combine the multiple equations into a single linear Diophantine equation with a much larger modulus &quot;M&quot; that is the product of all the individual moduli &quot;m&quot;&quot;i&quot;, and define &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; as
: formula_70

Thus, each &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the product of all the moduli &quot;except&quot; &quot;m&quot;&quot;i&quot;. The solution depends on finding &quot;N&quot; new numbers &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot; such that
: formula_71

With these numbers &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot;, any integer &quot;x&quot; can be reconstructed from its remainders &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; by the equation
: formula_72

Since these numbers &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot; are the multiplicative inverses of the &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot;, they may be found using Euclid&#x27;s algorithm as described in the previous subsection.

=== Stern–Brocot tree ===

The Euclidean algorithm can be used to arrange the set of all positive rational numbers into an infinite binary search tree, called the Stern–Brocot tree.
The number 1 (expressed as a fraction 1/1) is placed at the root of the tree, and the location of any other number &quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot; can be found by computing gcd(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) using the original form of the Euclidean algorithm, in which each step replaces the larger of the two given numbers by its difference with the smaller number (not its remainder), stopping when two equal numbers are reached. A step of the Euclidean algorithm that replaces the first of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its right child, and a step that replaces the second of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its left child. The sequence of steps constructed in this way does not depend on whether &quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot; is given in lowest terms, and forms a path from the root to a node containing the number &quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot;. This fact can be used to prove that each positive rational number appears exactly once in this tree.

For example, 3/4 can be found by starting at the root, going to the left once, then to the right twice:

: formula_73

The Euclidean algorithm has almost the same relationship to another binary tree on the rational numbers called the Calkin–Wilf tree. The difference is that the path is reversed: instead of producing a path from the root of the tree to a target, it produces a path from the target to the root.

=== Continued fractions ===
The Euclidean algorithm has a close relationship with continued fractions. The sequence of equations can be written in the form
: formula_74

The last term on the right-hand side always equals the inverse of the left-hand side of the next equation. Thus, the first two equations may be combined to form
: formula_75

The third equation may be used to substitute the denominator term &quot;r&quot;1/&quot;r&quot;0, yielding
: formula_76

The final ratio of remainders &quot;r&quot;&quot;k&quot;/&quot;r&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1 can always be replaced using the next equation in the series, up to the final equation. The result is a continued fraction
: formula_77

In the worked example above, the gcd(1071, 462) was calculated, and the quotients &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot; were 2, 3 and 7, respectively. Therefore, the fraction 1071/462 may be written
: formula_78
as can be confirmed by calculation.

=== Factorization algorithms ===
Calculating a greatest common divisor is an essential step in several integer factorization algorithms, such as Pollard&#x27;s rho algorithm, Shor&#x27;s algorithm, Dixon&#x27;s factorization method and the Lenstra elliptic curve factorization. The Euclidean algorithm may be used to find this GCD efficiently. Continued fraction factorization uses continued fractions, which are determined using Euclid&#x27;s algorithm.

== Algorithmic efficiency ==
The computational efficiency of Euclid&#x27;s algorithm has been studied thoroughly. This efficiency can be described by the number of division steps the algorithm requires, multiplied by the computational expense of each step. The first known analysis of Euclid&#x27;s algorithm is due to A. A. L. Reynaud in 1811, who showed that the number of division steps on input (&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) is bounded by &quot;v&quot;; later he improved this to &quot;v&quot;/2 + 2. Later, in 1841, P. J. E. Finck showed that the number of division steps is at most 2 log2 &quot;v&quot; + 1, and hence Euclid&#x27;s algorithm runs in time polynomial in the size of the input. Émile Léger, in 1837, studied the worst case, which is when the inputs are consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Finck&#x27;s analysis was refined by Gabriel Lamé in 1844, who showed that the number of steps required for completion is never more than five times the number &quot;h&quot; of base-10 digits of the smaller number &quot;b&quot;.

In the uniform cost model (suitable for analyzing the complexity of gcd calculation on numbers that fit into a single machine word), each step of the algorithm takes constant time, and Lamé&#x27;s analysis implies that the total running time is also &quot;O&quot;(&quot;h&quot;). However, in a model of computation suitable for computation with larger numbers, the computational expense of a single remainder computation in the algorithm can be as large as &quot;O&quot;(&quot;h&quot;2). In this case the total time for all of the steps of the algorithm can be analyzed using a telescoping series, showing that it is also &quot;O&quot;(&quot;h&quot;2). Modern algorithmic techniques based on the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm for fast integer multiplication can be used to speed this up, leading to quasilinear algorithms for the GCD.

=== Number of steps ===
The number of steps to calculate the GCD of two natural numbers, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, may be denoted by &quot;T&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;). If &quot;g&quot; is the GCD of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, then &quot;a&quot; = &quot;mg&quot; and &quot;b&quot; = &quot;ng&quot; for two coprime numbers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;. Then
as may be seen by dividing all the steps in the Euclidean algorithm by &quot;g&quot;. By the same argument, the number of steps remains the same if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are multiplied by a common factor &quot;w&quot;: &quot;T&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) = &quot;T&quot;(&quot;wa&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;). Therefore, the number of steps &quot;T&quot; may vary dramatically between neighboring pairs of numbers, such as T(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) and T(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; + 1), depending on the size of the two GCDs.

The recursive nature of the Euclidean algorithm gives another equation
where &quot;T&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, 0) = 0 by assumption.

==== Worst-case ====

If the Euclidean algorithm requires &quot;N&quot; steps for a pair of natural numbers &quot;a&quot; &gt; &quot;b&quot; &gt; 0, the smallest values of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; for which this is true are the Fibonacci numbers &quot;F&quot;&quot;N&quot;+2 and &quot;F&quot;&quot;N&quot;+1, respectively. More precisely, if the Euclidean algorithm requires &quot;N&quot; steps for the pair &quot;a&quot; &gt; &quot;b&quot;, then one has &quot;a&quot; ≥ &quot;F&quot;&quot;N&quot;+2 and &quot;b&quot; ≥ &quot;F&quot;&quot;N&quot;+1. This can be shown by induction. If &quot;N&quot; = 1, &quot;b&quot; divides &quot;a&quot; with no remainder; the smallest natural numbers for which this is true is &quot;b&quot; = 1 and &quot;a&quot; = 2, which are &quot;F&quot;2 and &quot;F&quot;3, respectively. Now assume that the result holds for all values of &quot;N&quot; up to &quot;M&quot; − 1. The first step of the &quot;M&quot;-step algorithm is &quot;a&quot; = &quot;q&quot;0&quot;b&quot; + &quot;r&quot;0, and the Euclidean algorithm requires &quot;M&quot; − 1 steps for the pair &quot;b&quot; &gt; &quot;r&quot;0. By induction hypothesis, one has &quot;b&quot; ≥ &quot;F&quot;&quot;M&quot;+1 and &quot;r&quot;0 ≥ &quot;F&quot;&quot;M&quot;. Therefore, &quot;a&quot; = &quot;q&quot;0&quot;b&quot; + &quot;r&quot;0 ≥ &quot;b&quot; + &quot;r&quot;0 ≥ &quot;F&quot;&quot;M&quot;+1 + &quot;F&quot;&quot;M&quot; = &quot;F&quot;&quot;M&quot;+2,
which is the desired inequality.
This proof, published by Gabriel Lamé in 1844, represents the beginning of computational complexity theory, and also the first practical application of the Fibonacci numbers.

This result suffices to show that the number of steps in Euclid&#x27;s algorithm can never be more than five times the number of its digits (base 10). For if the algorithm requires &quot;N&quot; steps, then &quot;b&quot; is greater than or equal to &quot;F&quot;&quot;N&quot;+1 which in turn is greater than or equal to &quot;φ&quot;&quot;N&quot;−1, where &quot;φ&quot; is the golden ratio. Since &quot;b&quot; ≥ &quot;φ&quot;&quot;N&quot;−1, then &quot;N&quot; − 1 ≤ log&quot;φ&quot;&quot;b&quot;. Since log10&quot;φ&quot; &gt; 1/5, (&quot;N&quot; − 1)/5 &lt; log10&quot;φ&quot; log&quot;φ&quot;&quot;b&quot; = log10&quot;b&quot;. Thus, &quot;N&quot; ≤ 5 log10&quot;b&quot;. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than &quot;O&quot;(&quot;h&quot;) divisions, where &quot;h&quot; is the number of digits in the smaller number &quot;b&quot;.

==== Average ====
The average number of steps taken by the Euclidean algorithm has been defined in three different ways. The first definition is the average time &quot;T&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) required to calculate the GCD of a given number &quot;a&quot; and a smaller natural number &quot;b&quot; chosen with equal probability from the integers 0 to &quot;a&quot; − 1
: formula_79

However, since &quot;T&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) fluctuates dramatically with the GCD of the two numbers, the averaged function &quot;T&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) is likewise &quot;noisy&quot;.

To reduce this noise, a second average &quot;τ&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) is taken over all numbers coprime with &quot;a&quot;
: formula_80

There are &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) coprime integers less than &quot;a&quot;, where &quot;φ&quot; is Euler&#x27;s totient function. This tau average grows smoothly with &quot;a&quot;

:formula_81

with the residual error being of order &quot;a&quot;−(1/6)+&quot;ε&quot;, where &quot;ε&quot; is infinitesimal. The constant &quot;C&quot; in this formula is called Porter&#x27;s constant and equals
: formula_82
where is the Euler–Mascheroni constant and is the derivative of the Riemann zeta function. The leading coefficient (12/π2) ln 2 was determined by two independent methods.

Since the first average can be calculated from the tau average by summing over the divisors &quot;d&quot; of &quot;a&quot;
: formula_83
it can be approximated by the formula
: formula_84
where Λ(&quot;d&quot;) is the Mangoldt function.

A third average &quot;Y&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is defined as the mean number of steps required when both &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) from 1 to &quot;n&quot;

: formula_85

Substituting the approximate formula for &quot;T&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) into this equation yields an estimate for &quot;Y&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)
: formula_86

=== Computational expense per step ===
In each step &quot;k&quot; of the Euclidean algorithm, the quotient &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot; and remainder &quot;r&quot;&quot;k&quot; are computed for a given pair of integers &quot;r&quot;&quot;k&quot;−2 and &quot;r&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1

The computational expense per step is associated chiefly with finding &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot;, since the remainder &quot;r&quot;&quot;k&quot; can be calculated quickly from &quot;r&quot;&quot;k&quot;−2, &quot;r&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1, and &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot;

The computational expense of dividing &quot;h&quot;-bit numbers scales as , where is the length of the quotient.

For comparison, Euclid&#x27;s original subtraction-based algorithm can be much slower. A single integer division is equivalent to the quotient &quot;q&quot; number of subtractions. If the ratio of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; is very large, the quotient is large and many subtractions will be required. On the other hand, it has been shown that the quotients are very likely to be small integers. The probability of a given quotient &quot;q&quot; is approximately where . For illustration, the probability of a quotient of 1, 2, 3, or 4 is roughly 41.5%, 17.0%, 9.3%, and 5.9%, respectively. Since the operation of subtraction is faster than division, particularly for large numbers, the subtraction-based Euclid&#x27;s algorithm is competitive with the division-based version. This is exploited in the binary version of Euclid&#x27;s algorithm.

Combining the estimated number of steps with the estimated computational expense per step shows that the Euclid&#x27;s algorithm grows quadratically (&quot;h&quot;2) with the average number of digits &quot;h&quot; in the initial two numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. Let represent the number of digits in the successive remainders . Since the number of steps &quot;N&quot; grows linearly with &quot;h&quot;, the running time is bounded by

: formula_87

=== Alternative methods ===
Euclid&#x27;s algorithm is widely used in practice, especially for small numbers, due to its simplicity. For comparison, the efficiency of alternatives to Euclid&#x27;s algorithm may be determined.

One inefficient approach to finding the GCD of two natural numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; is to calculate all their common divisors; the GCD is then the largest common divisor. The common divisors can be found by dividing both numbers by successive integers from 2 to the smaller number &quot;b&quot;. The number of steps of this approach grows linearly with &quot;b&quot;, or exponentially in the number of digits. Another inefficient approach is to find the prime factors of one or both numbers. As noted above, the GCD equals the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. Present methods for prime factorization are also inefficient; many modern cryptography systems even rely on that inefficiency.

The binary GCD algorithm is an efficient alternative that substitutes division with faster operations by exploiting the binary representation used by computers. However, this alternative also scales like &quot;O&quot;(&quot;h&quot;²). It is generally faster than the Euclidean algorithm on real computers, even though it scales in the same way. Additional efficiency can be gleaned by examining only the leading digits of the two numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. The binary algorithm can be extended to other bases (&quot;k&quot;-ary algorithms), with up to fivefold increases in speed. Lehmer&#x27;s GCD algorithm uses the same general principle as the binary algorithm to speed up GCD computations in arbitrary bases.

A recursive approach for very large integers (with more than 25,000 digits) leads to quasilinear integer GCD algorithms, such as those of Schönhage, and Stehlé and Zimmermann. These algorithms exploit the 2×2 matrix form of the Euclidean algorithm given above. These quasilinear methods generally scale as 

== Generalizations ==
Although the Euclidean algorithm is used to find the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers (positive integers), it may be generalized to the real numbers, and to other mathematical objects, such as polynomials, quadratic integers and Hurwitz quaternions. In the latter cases, the Euclidean algorithm is used to demonstrate the crucial property of unique factorization, i.e., that such numbers can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements, the counterparts of prime numbers. Unique factorization is essential to many proofs of number theory.

=== Rational and real numbers ===
Euclid&#x27;s algorithm can be applied to real numbers, as described by Euclid in Book 10 of his &quot;Elements&quot;. The goal of the algorithm is to identify a real number such that two given real numbers, and , are integer multiples of it: and , where and are integers. This identification is equivalent to finding an integer relation among the real numbers and ; that is, it determines integers and such that . If such an equation is possible, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are called commensurable lengths, otherwise they are incommensurable lengths.

The real-number Euclidean algorithm differs from its integer counterpart in two respects. First, the remainders are real numbers, although the quotients are integers as before. Second, the algorithm is not guaranteed to end in a finite number of steps. If it does, the fraction is a rational number, i.e., the ratio of two integers
: formula_88
and can be written as a finite continued fraction . If the algorithm does not stop, the fraction is an irrational number and can be described by an infinite continued fraction . Examples of infinite continued fractions are the golden ratio and the square root of two, . The algorithm is unlikely to stop, since almost all ratios of two real numbers are irrational.

An infinite continued fraction may be truncated at a step to yield an approximation to that improves as is increased. The approximation is described by convergents ; the numerator and denominators are coprime and obey the recurrence relation
: formula_89
where and are the initial values of the recursion. The convergent is the best rational number approximation to with denominator :
: formula_90

=== Polynomials ===

Polynomials in a single variable &quot;x&quot; can be added, multiplied and factored into irreducible polynomials, which are the analogs of the prime numbers for integers. The greatest common divisor polynomial of two polynomials and is defined as the product of their shared irreducible polynomials, which can be identified using the Euclidean algorithm. The basic procedure is similar to that for integers. At each step , a quotient polynomial and a remainder polynomial are identified to satisfy the recursive equation
: formula_91
where and . Each quotient polynomial is chosen such that each remainder is either zero or has a degree that is smaller than the degree of its predecessor: . Since the degree is a nonnegative integer, and since it decreases with every step, the Euclidean algorithm concludes in a finite number of steps. The last nonzero remainder is the greatest common divisor of the original two polynomials, and .

For example, consider the following two quartic polynomials, which each factor into two quadratic polynomials
: formula_92

Dividing by yields a remainder . In the next step, is divided by yielding a remainder . Finally, dividing by yields a zero remainder, indicating that is the greatest common divisor polynomial of and , consistent with their factorization.

Many of the applications described above for integers carry over to polynomials. The Euclidean algorithm can be used to solve linear Diophantine equations and Chinese remainder problems for polynomials; continued fractions of polynomials can also be defined.

The polynomial Euclidean algorithm has other applications, such as Sturm chains, a method for counting the zeros of a polynomial that lie inside a given real interval. This in turn has applications in several areas, such as the Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion in control theory.

Finally, the coefficients of the polynomials need not be drawn from integers, real numbers or even the complex numbers. For example, the coefficients may be drawn from a general field, such as the finite fields described above. The corresponding conclusions about the Euclidean algorithm and its applications hold even for such polynomials.

=== Gaussian integers ===
The Gaussian integers are complex numbers of the form , where and are ordinary integers and is the square root of negative one. By defining an analog of the Euclidean algorithm, Gaussian integers can be shown to be uniquely factorizable, by the argument above. This unique factorization is helpful in many applications, such as deriving all Pythagorean triples or proving Fermat&#x27;s theorem on sums of two squares. In general, the Euclidean algorithm is convenient in such applications, but not essential; for example, the theorems can often be proven by other arguments.

The Euclidean algorithm developed for two Gaussian integers and is nearly the same as that for ordinary integers, but differs in two respects. As before, we set and , and the task at each step is to identify a quotient and a remainder such that
: formula_93
where every remainder is strictly smaller than its predecessor: . The first difference is that the quotients and remainders are themselves Gaussian integers, and thus are complex numbers. The quotients are generally found by rounding the real and complex parts of the exact ratio (such as the complex number ) to the nearest integers. The second difference lies in the necessity of defining how one complex remainder can be &quot;smaller&quot; than another. To do this, a norm function is defined, which converts every Gaussian integer into an ordinary integer. After each step of the Euclidean algorithm, the norm of the remainder is smaller than the norm of the preceding remainder, . Since the norm is a nonnegative integer and decreases with every step, the Euclidean algorithm for Gaussian integers ends in a finite number of steps. The final nonzero remainder is , the Gaussian integer of largest norm that divides both and ; it is unique up to multiplication by a unit, or .

Many of the other applications of the Euclidean algorithm carry over to Gaussian integers. For example, it can be used to solve linear Diophantine equations and Chinese remainder problems for Gaussian integers; continued fractions of Gaussian integers can also be defined.

=== Euclidean domains ===
A set of elements under two binary operations, denoted as addition and multiplication, is called a Euclidean domain if it forms a commutative ring and, roughly speaking, if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them. The two operations of such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of ordinary arithmetic; rather, they can be more general, such as the operations of a mathematical group or monoid. Nevertheless, these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity.

The generalized Euclidean algorithm requires a &quot;Euclidean function&quot;, i.e., a mapping from into the set of nonnegative integers such that, for any two nonzero elements and in , there exist and in such that and . Examples of such mappings are the absolute value for integers, the degree for univariate polynomials, and the norm for Gaussian integers above. The basic principle is that each step of the algorithm reduces &quot;f&quot; inexorably; hence, if can be reduced only a finite number of times, the algorithm must stop in a finite number of steps. This principle relies on the well-ordering property of the non-negative integers, which asserts that every non-empty set of non-negative integers has a smallest member.

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic applies to any Euclidean domain: Any number from a Euclidean domain can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements. Any Euclidean domain is a unique factorization domain (UFD), although the converse is not true. The Euclidean domains and the UFD&#x27;s are subclasses of the GCD domains, domains in which a greatest common divisor of two numbers always exists. In other words, a greatest common divisor may exist (for all pairs of elements in a domain), although it may not be possible to find it using a Euclidean algorithm. A Euclidean domain is always a principal ideal domain (PID), an integral domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal. Again, the converse is not true: not every PID is a Euclidean domain.

The unique factorization of Euclidean domains is useful in many applications. For example, the unique factorization of the Gaussian integers is convenient in deriving formulae for all Pythagorean triples and in proving Fermat&#x27;s theorem on sums of two squares. Unique factorization was also a key element in an attempted proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem published in 1847 by Gabriel Lamé, the same mathematician who analyzed the efficiency of Euclid&#x27;s algorithm, based on a suggestion of Joseph Liouville. Lamé&#x27;s approach required the unique factorization of numbers of the form , where and are integers, and is an th root of 1, that is, . Although this approach succeeds for some values of (such as , the Eisenstein integers), in general such numbers do factor uniquely. This failure of unique factorization in some cyclotomic fields led Ernst Kummer to the concept of ideal numbers and, later, Richard Dedekind to ideals.

==== Unique factorization of quadratic integers ====

The quadratic integer rings are helpful to illustrate Euclidean domains. Quadratic integers are generalizations of the Gaussian integers in which the imaginary unit &quot;i&quot; is replaced by a number . Thus, they have the form , where and are integers and has one of two forms, depending on a parameter . If does not equal a multiple of four plus one, then
: formula_94

If, however, does equal a multiple of four plus one, then
: formula_95

If the function corresponds to a norm function, such as that used to order the Gaussian integers above, then the domain is known as &quot;norm-Euclidean&quot;. The norm-Euclidean rings of quadratic integers are exactly those where is one of the values −11, −7, −3, −2, −1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, or 73. The cases and yield the Gaussian integers and Eisenstein integers, respectively.

If is allowed to be any Euclidean function, then the list of possible values of for which the domain is Euclidean is not yet known. The first example of a Euclidean domain that was not norm-Euclidean (with ) was published in 1994. In 1973, Weinberger proved that a quadratic integer ring with is Euclidean if, and only if, it is a principal ideal domain, provided that the generalized Riemann hypothesis holds.

=== Noncommutative rings ===
The Euclidean algorithm may be applied to some noncommutative rings such as the set of Hurwitz quaternions. Let and represent two elements from such a ring. They have a common right divisor if and for some choice of and in the ring. Similarly, they have a common left divisor if and for some choice of and in the ring. Since multiplication is not commutative, there are two versions of the Euclidean algorithm, one for right divisors and one for left divisors. Choosing the right divisors, the first step in finding the by the Euclidean algorithm can be written
: formula_96
where represents the quotient and the remainder. Here the quotient and remainder are chosen so that (if nonzero) the remainder has for a &quot;Euclidean function&quot; &quot;N&quot; defined analogously to the Euclidean functions of Euclidean domains in the non-commutative case. This equation shows that any common right divisor of and is likewise a common divisor of the remainder . The analogous equation for the left divisors would be
: formula_97

With either choice, the process is repeated as above until the greatest common right or left divisor is identified. As in the Euclidean domain, the &quot;size&quot; of the remainder (formally, its Euclidean function or &quot;norm&quot;) must be strictly smaller than , and there must be only a finite number of possible sizes for , so that the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate.

Many results for the GCD carry over to noncommutative numbers. For example, Bézout&#x27;s identity states that the right can be expressed as a linear combination of and . In other words, there are numbers and such that
: formula_98

The analogous identity for the left GCD is nearly the same:
: formula_99

Bézout&#x27;s identity can be used to solve Diophantine equations. For instance, one of the standard proofs of Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem, that every positive integer can be represented as a sum of four squares, is based on quaternion GCDs in this way.

<text>The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is an independent intergovernmental organisation supported by most of the nations of Europe. It is based at three sites: Shinfield Park, Reading, United Kingdom; Bologna, Italy; and Bonn, Germany. It operates one of the largest supercomputer complexes in Europe and the world&#x27;s largest archive of numerical weather prediction data.

== History ==

ECMWF was established in 1975, in recognition of the need to pool the scientific and technical resources of Europe&#x27;s meteorological services and institutions for the production of weather forecasts for medium-range timescales (up to approximately two weeks) and of the economic and social benefits expected from it. The Centre employs about 350 staff, mostly appointed from across the member states and co-operating states.

In 2017, the centre&#x27;s member states accepted an offer from the Italian Government to move ECMWF&#x27;s data centre to Bologna, Italy. The new site, a former tobacco factory, would be redesigned by the architecture firm gmp.

During 2020, the Centre arranged to move its Copernicus operations away from Reading and into European Union territory. Following bids from Toulouse, Italy, Austria, Germany, Spain and Ireland, eventually Bonn (Germany) was chosen. The move has been directly attributed to Brexit.

== Objectives ==

ECMWF aims to provide accurate medium-range global weather forecasts out to 15 days and seasonal forecasts out to 12 months. Its products are provided to the national weather services of its member states and co-operating states as a complement to their national short-range and climatological activities, and those national states use ECMWF&#x27;s products for their own national duties, in particular to give early warning of potentially damaging severe weather.

ECMWF&#x27;s core mission is to:
* Produce numerical weather forecasts and monitor planetary systems that influence weather
* Carry out scientific and technical research to improve forecast skill
* Maintain an archive of meteorological data

To deliver this core mission, the Centre provides:
* Twice-daily global numerical weather forecasts
* Air quality analysis
* Atmospheric composition monitoring
* Climate monitoring
* Ocean circulation analysis
* Hydrological prediction

The Centre develops and operates global atmospheric models and data assimilation systems for the dynamics, thermodynamics and composition of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and for interacting parts of the Earth-system. It uses numerical weather prediction methods to prepare forecasts and their initial conditions, and it contributes to monitoring the relevant parts of the Earth system.

=== Copernicus ===
The centre currently serves as the Entrusted Entity responsible for delivery of two of the Services of the EU&#x27;s Copernicus Programme. The two services are the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).

The Centre arranged to move its Copernicus operations away from Reading and into Bonn (Germany). The move has been directly attributed to Brexit.

== Work and projects ==

=== Forecasting ===
Numerical weather prediction (NWP) requires input of meteorological data, collected by satellites and earth observation systems such as automatic and crewed weather stations, aircraft (including commercial flights), ships and weather balloons. Assimilation of this data is used to produce an initial state of a computer model of the atmosphere, from which an atmospheric model is used to forecast the weather. These forecasts are typically:
* medium-range forecasts, predicting the weather up to 15 days ahead
* monthly forecasts, predicting the weather on a weekly basis 30 days ahead
* seasonal forecasts up to 12 months ahead.

Over the past three decades ECMWF&#x27;s wide-ranging programme of research has played a major role in developing such assimilation and modelling systems. This improves the accuracy and reliability of weather forecasting by about a day per decade, so that a seven-day forecast now (2015) is as accurate as a three-day forecast was four decades ago (1975).

=== Monthly and seasonal forecasts ===
ECMWF&#x27;s monthly and seasonal forecasts provide early predictions of events such as heat waves, cold spells and droughts, as well as their impacts on sectors such as agriculture, energy and health. Since ECMWF runs a wave model, there are also predictions of coastal waves and storm surges in European waters which can be used to provide warnings.

=== Early warning of severe weather events ===
Forecasts of severe weather events allow appropriate mitigating action to be taken and contingency plans to be put into place by the authorities and the public. The increased time gained by issuing accurate warnings can save lives, for instance by evacuating people from a storm surge area. Authorities and businesses can plan to maintain services around threats such as high winds, floods or snow.

In October 2012 the ECMWF model suggested seven days in advance that Hurricane Sandy was likely to make landfall on the East Coast of the United States.
It also predicted the intensity and track of the November 2012 nor&#x27;easter, which impacted the east coast a week after Sandy.

ECMWF&#x27;s Extreme Forecast Index (EFI) was developed as a tool to identify where the EPS (Ensemble Prediction System) forecast distribution differs substantially from that of the model climate. It contains information regarding variability of weather parameters, in location and time and can highlight an abnormality of a weather situation without having to define specific space- and time-dependent thresholds.

=== Satellite data ===
ECMWF, through its partnerships with EUMETSAT, ESA, the EU and others, exploits satellite data for operational numerical weather prediction and operational seasonal forecasting with coupled atmosphere–ocean–land models. The increasing amount of satellite data and the development of more sophisticated ways of extracting information from that data have made a major contribution to improving the accuracy and utility of NWP forecasts. ECMWF continuously endeavours to improve the use of satellite observations for NWP.

=== Reanalysis ===

ECMWF supports research on climate variability using an approach known as reanalysis. This involves feeding weather observations collected over decades into a NWP system to recreate past atmospheric, sea- and land-surface conditions over specific time periods to obtain a clearer picture of how the climate has changed. Reanalysis provides a four-dimensional picture of the atmosphere and effectively allows monitoring of the variability and change of global climate, thereby contributing also to the understanding and attribution of climate change.

To date, and with support from Europe&#x27;s National Meteorological Services and the European Commission, ECMWF has conducted several major reanalyses of the global atmosphere: the first ECMWF re-analysis (ERA-15) project generated reanalyses from December 1978 to February 1994; the ERA-40 project generated reanalyses from September 1957 to August 2002. The ERA-Interim reanalysis covered the period from 1979 onwards. A reanalysis product (ERA5) with higher spatial resolution (31 km) was released by ECMWF in 2019 as part of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.

=== Operational forecast model ===

ECMWF&#x27;s operational forecasts are produced from its &quot;Integrated Forecast System&quot; (sometimes informally known in the United States as the &quot;European model&quot;) which is run every twelve hours and forecasts out to ten days.

It includes both a &quot;deterministic forecast&quot; mode and an ensemble. The deterministic forecast is a single model run that is relatively high in resolution as well as in computational expense. The ensemble is relatively low (about half that of the deterministic) in resolution (and in computational expense), so less accurate. But it is run 51 times in parallel, from slightly different initial conditions to give a spread of likelihood over the range of the forecast.

As of 2021, the ECMWF&#x27;s weather model is generally considered to be the most accurate weather forecasting model.

== Member and co-operating states ==
ECMWF comprises 23 European countries:
* the eighteen founding states of 1975: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom.
* five states that joined since 2010: Iceland (April 2011), Slovenia (December 2012), Serbia (January 2015), Croatia (January 2016), Estonia (December 2020). 

It also has co-operation agreements with other states: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Morocco, Romania and Slovakia.
