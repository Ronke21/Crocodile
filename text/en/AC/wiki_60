<doc id="13217" wikidata="Q37707" url="?curid=13217" title="Haiku">
<text>is a type of short form poetry that originated in Japan. Traditional Japanese haiku consist of three phrases composed of 17 morae (called &quot;on&quot; in Japanese) in a 5, 7, 5 pattern; that include a &quot;kireji&quot;, or &quot;cutting word&quot;; and a &quot;kigo&quot;, or seasonal reference. However, haiku by classical Japanese poets, such as Matsuo Bashō, also deviate from the 17-&quot;on&quot; pattern and sometimes do not contain a &quot;kireji&quot;. Similar poems that do not adhere to these rules are generally classified as &quot;senryū&quot;.

Haiku originated as an opening part of a larger Japanese genre of poetry called renga. These haiku written as an opening stanza were known as &quot;hokku&quot; and over time they began to be written as stand-alone poems. Haiku was given its current name by the Japanese writer Masaoka Shiki at the end of the 19th century.

Originally from Japan, haiku today are written by authors worldwide. Haiku in English and haiku in other languages have different styles and traditions while still incorporating aspects of the traditional haiku form. Non-Japanese language haiku vary widely on how closely they follow traditional elements. Additionally, a minority movement within , supported by Ogiwara Seisensui and his disciples, has varied from the tradition of 17 &quot;on&quot; as well as taking nature as their subject.

In Japanese, haiku are traditionally printed as a single line, while haiku in English often appear as three lines, although variations exist. There are several other forms of Japanese poetry related to haiku, such as tanka, as well as other art forms that incorporate haiku, such as haibun and haiga.

==Traditional elements==
===&quot;Kiru&quot; and &quot;kireji&quot;===

In Japanese haiku, a &quot;kireji&quot;, or cutting word, typically appears at the end of one of the verse&#x27;s three phrases. A &quot;kireji&quot; fills a role analogous to that of a &quot;caesura&quot; in classical Western poetry or to a volta in sonnets. A &quot;kireji&quot; helps mark rhythmic divisions. Depending on which &quot;kireji&quot; is chosen and its position within the verse, it may briefly cut the stream of thought, suggesting a parallel between the preceding and following phrases, or it may provide a dignified ending, concluding the verse with a heightened sense of closure.

The &quot;kireji&quot; lends the verse structural support, allowing it to stand as an independent poem. The use of &quot;kireji&quot; distinguishes haiku and hokku from second and subsequent verses of renku; which may employ semantic and syntactic disjuncture, even to the point of occasionally end-stopping a phrase with a . However, renku typically employ &quot;kireji&quot;.

In English, since &quot;kireji&quot; have no direct equivalent, poets sometimes use punctuation such as a dash or ellipsis, or an implied break to create a juxtaposition intended to prompt the reader to reflect on the relationship between the two parts.

The &quot;kireji&quot; in the Bashō examples &quot;old pond&quot; and &quot;the wind of Mt Fuji&quot; are both &quot;ya&quot; (). Neither the remaining Bashō example nor the Issa example contain a &quot;kireji&quot;. However, they do both balance a fragment in the first five &quot;on&quot; against a phrase in the remaining 12 &quot;on&quot; (it may not be apparent from the English translation of the Issa that the first five &quot;on&quot; mean &quot;Edo&#x27;s rain&quot;).

===&quot;On&quot;===

In comparison with English verse typically characterized by syllabic meter, Japanese verse counts sound units known as &quot;on&quot; or morae. Traditional haiku is usually fixed verse that consists of 17 &quot;on&quot;, in three phrases of five, seven, and five &quot;on&quot;, respectively. Among modern poems, traditionalist haiku continue to use the 5-7-5 pattern while free form haiku do not. However, one of the examples below illustrates that traditional haiku masters were not always constrained by the 5-7-5 pattern either. The free form haiku was advocated for by Ogiwara Seisensui and his disciples.

Although the word &quot;on&quot; is sometimes translated as &quot;syllable&quot;, the true meaning is more nuanced. One &quot;on&quot; in Japanese is counted for a short syllable, two for an elongated vowel or doubled consonant, and one for an &quot;n&quot; at the end of a syllable. Thus, the word &quot;haibun&quot;, though counted as two syllables in English, is counted as four &quot;on&quot; in Japanese (ha-i-bu-n); and the word &quot;on&quot; itself, which English-speakers would view as a single syllable, comprises two &quot;on&quot;: the short vowel o and the n. This is illustrated by the Issa haiku below, which contains 17 &quot;on&quot; but only 15 syllables. Conversely, some sounds, such as &quot;kyo&quot; () may look like two syllables to English speakers but are in fact a single &quot;on&quot; (as well as a single syllable) in Japanese.

In 1973, the Haiku Society of America noted that the norm for writers of haiku in English was to use 17 syllables, but they also noted a trend toward shorter haiku. According to the society, about 12 syllables in English approximates the duration of 17 Japanese &quot;on&quot;.

===&quot;Kigo&quot;===

A haiku traditionally contains a &quot;kigo&quot;, a word or phrase that symbolizes or implies the season of the poem and is drawn from a &quot;saijiki&quot;, an extensive but prescriptive list of such words. Season words are evocative of images that are associated with the same time of year, making it a kind of logopoeia. &quot;Kigo&quot; are not always included in non-Japanese haiku or by modern writers of Japanese free-form haiku.

==Origin and development==

===From hokku to haiku===

Hokku is the opening stanza of an orthodox collaborative linked poem, or renga, and of its later derivative, renku (or &quot;haikai no renga&quot;). By the time of Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694), the hokku had begun to appear as an independent poem, and was also incorporated in haibun (a combination of prose and hokku), and haiga (a combination of painting with hokku). In the late 19th century, Masaoka Shiki (1867–1902) renamed the standalone hokku to haiku. The latter term is now generally applied retrospectively to all hokku appearing independently of renku or renga, irrespective of when they were written, and the use of the term hokku to describe a stand-alone poem is considered obsolete.

===Bashō===

In the 17th century, two masters arose who elevated &quot;haikai&quot; and gave it a new popularity. They were Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694) and Uejima Onitsura (1661–1738). &quot;Hokku&quot; is the first verse of the collaborative &quot;haikai&quot; or &quot;renku&quot;, but its position as the opening verse made it the most important, setting the tone for the whole composition. Even though &quot;hokku&quot; had sometimes appeared individually, they were always understood in the context of &quot;renku&quot;. The Bashō school promoted standalone &quot;hokku&quot; by including many in their anthologies, thus giving birth to what is now called &quot;haiku&quot;. Bashō also used his &quot;hokku&quot; as torque points within his short prose sketches and longer travel diaries. This subgenre of &quot;haikai&quot; is known as &quot;haibun&quot;. His best-known work, &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;, or &quot;Narrow Roads to the Interior&quot;, is counted as one of the classics of Japanese literature and has been translated into English extensively.

Bashō was deified by both the imperial government and Shinto religious headquarters one hundred years after his death because he raised the haikai genre from a playful game of wit to sublime poetry. He continues to be revered as a saint of poetry in Japan, and is the one name from classical Japanese literature that is familiar throughout the world.

===Buson===
The next famous style of haikai to arise was that of Yosa Buson (1716–1784) and others such as Kitō, called the Tenmei style after the Tenmei Era (1781–1789) in which it was created.

Buson is recognized as one of the greatest masters of haiga (an art form where the painting is combined with haiku or haikai prose). His affection for painting can be seen in the painterly style of his haiku.

===Issa===

No new popular style followed Buson. However, a very individualistic, and at the same time humanistic, approach to writing haiku was demonstrated by the poet Kobayashi Issa (1763–1827), whose miserable childhood, poverty, sad life, and devotion to the Pure Land sect of Buddhism are evident in his poetry. Issa made the genre immediately accessible to wider audiences.

===Shiki===

Masaoka Shiki (1867–1902) was a reformer and modernizer. A prolific writer, even though chronically ill during a significant part of his life, Shiki disliked the &#x27;stereotype&#x27; of haikai writers of the 19th century who were known by the deprecatory term &quot;tsukinami&quot;, meaning &#x27;monthly&#x27;, after the monthly or twice-monthly &quot;haikai&quot; gatherings of the end of the 18th century (in regard to this period of &quot;haikai&quot;, it came to mean &#x27;trite&#x27; and &#x27;hackneyed&#x27;). Shiki also sometimes criticized Bashō. Like the Japanese intellectual world in general at that time, Shiki was strongly influenced by Western culture. He favored the painterly style of Buson and particularly the European concept of &quot;plein-air&quot; painting, which he adapted to create a style of haiku as a kind of nature sketch in words, an approach called . He popularized his views by verse columns and essays in newspapers.

Hokku up to the time of Shiki, even when appearing independently, were written in the context of renku. Shiki formally separated his new style of verse from the context of collaborative poetry. Being agnostic, he also separated it from the influence of Buddhism. Further, he discarded the term &quot;hokku&quot; and proposed the term &quot;haiku&quot; as an abbreviation of the phrase &quot;haikai no ku&quot; meaning a verse of &quot;haikai&quot;, although the term predates Shiki by some two centuries, when it was used to mean &quot;any&quot; verse of haikai. Since then, &quot;haiku&quot; has been the term usually applied in both Japanese and English to all independent haiku, irrespective of their date of composition. Shiki&#x27;s revisionism dealt a severe blow to renku and surviving haikai schools. The term &quot;hokku&quot; is now used chiefly in its original sense of the opening verse of a renku, and rarely to distinguish haiku written before Shiki&#x27;s time.

==Exposure to the West==
The earliest Westerner known to have written haiku was the Dutchman Hendrik Doeff (1764–1837), who was the Dutch commissioner in the Dejima trading post in Nagasaki during the first years of the 19th century. One of his haiku is the following:

Although there were further attempts outside Japan to imitate the &quot;hokku&quot; in the early 20th century, there was little understanding of its principles. Early Western scholars such as Basil Hall Chamberlain (1850–1935) and William George Aston were mostly dismissive of hokku&#x27;s poetic value.

===Blyth===

R. H. Blyth was an Englishman who lived in Japan. He produced a series of works on Zen, haiku, senryū, and on other forms of Japanese and Asian literature. In 1949, with the publication in Japan of the first volume of &quot;Haiku&quot;, the four-volume work by Blyth, haiku were introduced to the post-war English-speaking world. This four-volume series (1949–52) described haiku from the pre-modern period up to and including Shiki. Blyth&#x27;s &quot;History of Haiku&quot; (1964) in two volumes is regarded as a classical study of haiku. Today Blyth is best known as a major interpreter of haiku to English speakers. His works have stimulated the writing of haiku in English.

===Shimoi===

The Japanese-Italian translator and poet Harukichi Shimoi introduced haiku to Italy in the 1920s, through his work with the magazine Sakura as well as his close personal relationships within the Italian literati. Two notable influences are the haiku of his close friend Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio, and to a lesser extent, those of Ezra Pound, to whom he was introduced in the early 1930s. An early example of his work appears in the 1919 novella &quot;La guerra italiana vista da un giapponese&quot;, which features a haiku by the Japanese feminist poet Yosano Akiko:

===Yasuda===
The Japanese-American scholar and translator Kenneth Yasuda published &quot;The Japanese Haiku: Its Essential Nature, History, and Possibilities in English, with Selected Examples&quot; in 1957. The book includes both translations from Japanese and original poems of his own in English, which had previously appeared in his book titled &quot;A Pepper-Pod: Classic Japanese Poems together with Original Haiku&quot;. In these books Yasuda presented a critical theory about haiku, to which he added comments on haiku poetry by early 20th-century poets and critics. His translations apply a 5–7–5 syllable count in English, with the first and third lines end-rhymed. Yasuda considered that haiku translated into English should utilize all of the poetic resources of the language. Yasuda&#x27;s theory also includes the concept of a &quot;haiku moment&quot; based in personal experience, and provides the motive for writing a haiku: an aesthetic moment&#x27; of a timeless feeling of enlightened harmony as the poet&#x27;s nature and the environment are unified&quot;. This notion of the haiku moment has resonated with haiku writers in English, even though the notion is not widely promoted in Japanese haiku.

===Henderson===

In 1958, &quot;An Introduction to Haiku: An Anthology of Poems and Poets from Bashô to Shiki&quot; by Harold G. Henderson was published by Doubleday Anchor Books. This book was a revision of Henderson&#x27;s earlier book titled &quot;The Bamboo Broom&quot; (Houghton Mifflin, 1934). After World War II, Henderson and Blyth worked for the American Occupation in Japan and for the Imperial Household, respectively, and their shared appreciation of haiku helped form a bond between the two.

Henderson translated every hokku and haiku into a rhymed tercet (ABA), whereas the Japanese originals never used rhyme. Unlike Yasuda, however, he recognized that 17 syllables in English are generally longer than the 17 &quot;on&quot; of a traditional Japanese haiku. Because the normal modes of English poetry depend on accentual meter rather than on syllabics, Henderson chose to emphasize the order of events and images in the originals. Nevertheless, many of Henderson&#x27;s translations were in the five-seven-five pattern.

==Haiku in other languages==

In France, haiku was introduced by Paul-Louis Couchoud around 1906.

In the early 20th century, Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore composed haiku in Bengali. He also translated some from Japanese. In Gujarati, Jhinabhai Desai &#x27;Sneharashmi&#x27; popularized haiku and remained a popular haiku writer. In February 2008, the World Haiku Festival was held in Bangalore, gathering &quot;haijin&quot; from all over India and Bangladesh, as well as from Europe and the United States. In South Asia, some other poets also write Haiku from time to time, most notably including the Pakistani poet Omer Tarin, who is also active in the movement for global nuclear disarmament and some of his &#x27;Hiroshima Haiku&#x27; have been read at various peace conferences in Japan and the UK. Indian writer in Malayalam language, Ashitha, wrote several Haiku poems which have been published as a book. Her poems helped popularise haiku among the readers of Malayalam literature.

In 1992 Nobel laureate Czesław Miłosz published the volume &quot;Haiku&quot; in which he translated from English to Polish haiku of Japanese masters and American and Canadian contemporary haiku authors.

The former president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, is a haiku writer and known as &quot;Haiku Herman&quot;. He published a book of haiku in April 2010.

===English-language haiku===

Paul-Louis Couchoud&#x27;s articles on haiku in French were read by early Imagist theoretician F. S. Flint, who passed on Couchoud&#x27;s ideas to other members of the proto-Imagist Poets&#x27; Club such as Ezra Pound. Amy Lowell made a trip to London to meet Pound and learn about haiku. She returned to the United States, where she worked to interest others in this &quot;new&quot; form. Haiku subsequently had a considerable influence on Imagists in the 1910s, notably Pound&#x27;s &quot;In a Station of the Metro&quot; of 1913, but, notwithstanding several efforts by Yone Noguchi to explain &quot;the hokku spirit&quot;, there was as yet little understanding of the form and its history.

One of the first advocates of English-language hokku was the Japanese poet Yone Noguchi. In &quot;A Proposal to American Poets,&quot; published in the &quot;Reader&quot; magazine in February 1904, Noguchi gave a brief outline of the hokku and some of his English efforts, ending with the exhortation, &quot;Pray, you try Japanese Hokku, my American poets!&quot; At about the same time the poet Sadakichi Hartmann was publishing original English-language hokku, as well as other Japanese forms in both English and French.

Scholar Richard Iadonisi writes in his article, &quot;I Am Nobody&quot; that novelist Richard Wright is considered, &quot;the first noteworthy American minority writer&quot; to produce haiku. There is much scholarly debate over why Wright became interested with the haiku form. It is known that he had begun to study haiku while battling dysentery. While Wright was purportedly an avid reader of Ezra Pound— whose Imagist poetry was based on the haiku form— Iadonisi suggests that Wright was not interested in American style haiku. Instead, Wright opted to study the techniques of British writer Reginald Horace Blyth. He also studied classical haiku poets such as Kobayashi Issa and Matsuo Bashō. Wright began writing a series of haiku in the summer of 1959, completing it in 1960. He had written thousands of haiku between that time span. Wright titled his work &quot;Haiku: This Other World&quot; and submitted it to William Targ of World Publishing, who rejected it. In 1998, thirty-eight years after Wright&#x27;s death, &quot;This Other World&quot; was finally published.

===Italian-language haiku===
Probably one of the first Italian encounters with Japanese poetry took place through the literary magazine &quot;L&#x27;Eco della Cultura&quot; (founded in 1914), which published texts of Japanese poetry edited by Vincenzo Siniscalchi. From 1920 to 1921, the University of Naples published a magazine, &quot;Sakura&quot;, on the study of Japanese culture, with the collaboration of the Japanese scholar Harukichi Shimoi. An Italian translation of a haiku by Akiko Yosano is included in Shimoi&#x27;s 1919 novella &quot;La guerra italiana vista da un giapponese&quot;. Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio also experimented with the haiku in the early twentieth century.

In 1921 the magazine &quot;La Ronda&quot; published a negative critique of the Japanese &quot;Hai-kai&quot; fashion that was spreading in France and Spain, while in the following years many futurists appreciated the fast haiku style. In Italy, the national haiku association was founded in Rome in 1987 by Sono Uchida, the well-known Japanese haijin and the ambassador of Japan in Vatican. Soon after, the national association called Italian Friends of the haiku (Associazione Italiana Amici dell&#x27;Haiku) was established, and then the Italian Haiku Association. The poet Mario Chini (1876–1959) published the book of haiku titled &quot;Moments&quot; (Rome, 1960). Later, Edoardo Sanguineti published some of his haiku. The famed poet Andrea Zanzotto also published a collection of haiku in English, which he translated back into his native Italian (Haiku for a Season / Haiku per una stagione, Chicago: U. of Chicago Press, 2021).

===Spanish-language haiku===
In Spain, several prominent poets experimented with haiku, including Joan Alcover, Antonio Machado, Juan Ramón Jiménez and Luis Cernuda. Federico García Lorca also experimented with and learned conciseness from the form while still a student in 1921. The most persistent, however, was Isaac del Vando, whose &quot;La Sombrilla Japonesa&quot; (1924) went through several editions. The form was also used in Catalan by the avant-garde writers Josep Maria Junoy (1885–1955) and Joan Salvat-Papasseit, by the latter notably in his sequence &quot;Vibracions&quot; (1921).

The Mexican poet José Juan Tablada is credited with popularising haiku in his country, reinforced by the publication of two collections composed entirely in that form: &quot;Un dia&quot; (1919), and &quot;El jarro de flores&quot; (1922). In the introduction to the latter, Tablada noted that two young Mexicans, Rafael Lozano and Carlos Gutiérrez Cruz, had also begun writing them. They were followed soon after by Carlos Pellicer, Xavier Villaurrutia, and by Jaime Torres Bodet in his collection &quot;Biombo&quot; (1925). Much later, Octavio Paz included many haiku in &quot;Piedras Sueltas&quot; (1955).

Elsewhere the Ecuadorian poet and diplomat Jorge Carrera Andrade included haiku among the 31 poems contained in &quot;Microgramas&quot; (Tokio 1940) and the Argentine Jorge Luis Borges in the collection &quot;La cifra&quot; (1981).

=== Southeastern Europe ===
The first publication in Yugoslavia treating haiku was Miloš Crnjanski&#x27;s &quot;Poezija starog Japana&quot; (Poetry of Ancient Japan), published in 1925. He was attracted to the aesthetics of &quot;aioi-no-matsu&quot; - the eternal - and Buddhist empathy, in common with his poetic theme of connecting distant things and concepts through affection.

In socialist Yugoslavia, development of haiku poetry began during the 1960s, when the first haiku books were written, starting with &quot;Leptirova krila&quot; (The Butterfly&#x27;s Wings) by Dubravko Ivančan in 1964. Other writers include Vladimir Zorčić (1941–1995), Milan Tokin&#x27;s (1909–1962) unpublished collection &quot;Godišnja doba&quot; (Seasons), Desanka Maksimović, Alexander Neugebauer (1930–1989), and Zvonko Petrović (1925–2009). Vladimir Devide (1925–2010) published the first book on haiku theory in 1970, titled Japanese Poetry and its Cultural and Historical Context, with many translations of Japanese classics. Dejan Razić (1935–1985) published two books on haiku in 1979, The Development of Haikai Poetry from its Beginning to Basho, and The Peak of Haikai Poetry. The journal Haiku ran from 1977 to 1981.

The Haiku Marathon (1982) and the Yugoslav Haiku Competition (1985) were organised in the 1980s by Slavko Sedlar. The first Serbian haiku journal Paun started being published in 1988 with Milijan Despotović as an editor. The journal Kulture istoka (1983–1992) gave further impetus to the study of Japanese and other oriental cultures. In 1991, the Belgrade-based haiku club Šiki was formed, named after Masaoka Shiki. In 1999, Anakiev together with Serge Tome created the web site Haiku Association of Southeastern Europe. The Haiku Association of Yugoslavia was formed in 2000. The multilingual &quot;Knots- The Anthology of Southeastern European Haiku Poetry&quot; was published in 1999 with poems from writers all over southeastern Europe. The 2000 conference of the World Haiku Federation was held in Slovenia.

===Haibun===

Haibun is a combination of prose and haiku, often autobiographical or written in the form of a travel journal. Well-known examples of haibun include &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot; by Bashō and &quot;Ora ga Haru&quot; by Issa.

===Haiga===

Haiga is a style of Japanese painting based on the aesthetics of haikai, and usually including a haiku. Today, haiga artists combine haiku with paintings, photographs and other art.

===Kuhi===
The carving of famous haiku on natural stone to make poem monuments known as &quot;kuhi&quot; () has been a popular practice for many centuries. The city of Matsuyama has more than two hundred &quot;kuhi&quot;.

<text>Howard Winchester Hawks (May 30, 1896December 26, 1977) was an American film director, producer, and screenwriter of the classic Hollywood era. Critic Leonard Maltin called him &quot;the greatest American director who is not a household name.&quot; Roger Ebert called Hawks &quot;one of the greatest American directors of pure movies, and a hero of auteur critics because he found his own laconic values in so many different kinds of genre material.&quot; He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for &quot;Sergeant York&quot; (1941) and earned the Honorary Academy Award in 1974. A versatile director, Hawks explored many genres such as comedies, dramas, gangster films, science fiction, film noir, war films and Westerns. His most popular films include &quot;Scarface&quot; (1932), &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938), &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot; (1939), &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940), &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; (1944), &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1946), &quot;Red River&quot; (1948), &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; (1951), &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (1953), and &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (1959). His frequent portrayals of strong, tough-talking female characters came to define the &quot;Hawksian woman&quot;.

His work has influenced such directors as Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, John Carpenter, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Quentin Tarantino and Michael Mann. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed Hawks fourth on their list of greatest directors, writing: &quot;His hallmarks are more thematic than visual: men who adhere to an understated code of manliness; women who like to yank the rug out from under those men&#x27;s feet; a mistrust of pomposity; a love of sly, leg-pulling wit. Yet there&#x27;s the ease of the complete filmmaker in his Westerns, dramas, musicals, detective films, and supremely confident comedies. No wonder the French adored the guy: His casual profundity was the studio&#x27;s best advertisement for itself.&quot; Jean-Luc Godard called him &quot;the greatest of all American artists&quot;.

==Early life and background==
Howard Winchester Hawks was born in Goshen, Indiana. He was the first-born child of Frank Winchester Hawks (1865–1950), a wealthy paper manufacturer, and his wife, Helen Brown (née Howard; 1872–1952), the daughter of a wealthy industrialist. Hawks&#x27;s family on his father&#x27;s side were American pioneers, and his ancestor John Hawks had emigrated from England to Massachusetts in 1630. The family eventually settled in Goshen and by the 1890s was one of the wealthiest families in the Midwest, due mostly to the highly profitable Goshen Milling Company.

Hawks&#x27;s maternal grandfather, C. W. Howard (1845–1916), had homesteaded in Neenah, Wisconsin, in 1862 at age 17. Within 15 years he had made his fortune in the town&#x27;s paper mill and other industrial endeavors. Frank Hawks and Helen Howard met in the early 1890s and married in 1895. Howard Hawks was the eldest of five children, and his birth was followed by Kenneth Neil Hawks (August 12, 1898 – January 2, 1930), William Bellinger Hawks (January 29, 1901 – January 10, 1969), Grace Louise Hawks (October 17, 1903 – December 23, 1927), and Helen Bernice Hawks (1906 – May 4, 1911). In 1898, the family moved back to Neenah where Frank Hawks began working for his father-in-law&#x27;s Howard Paper Company.

Between 1906 and 1909, the Hawks family began to spend more time in Pasadena, California, during the cold Wisconsin winters in order to improve Helen Hawks&#x27;s ill health. Gradually, they began to spend only their summers in Wisconsin before permanently moving to Pasadena in 1910. The family settled in a house down the street from Throop Polytechnic Institute, and the Hawks children began attending the school&#x27;s Polytechnic Elementary School in 1907. Hawks was an average student and did not excel in sports, but by 1910 had discovered coaster racing, an early form of soapbox racing. In 1911, Hawks&#x27;s youngest sibling, Helen, died suddenly of food poisoning. From 1910 to 1912, Hawks attended Pasadena High School. In 1912, the Hawks family moved to nearby Glendora, California, where Frank Hawks owned orange groves. Hawks finished his junior year of high school at Citrus Union High School in Glendora. During this time he worked as a barnstorming pilot.

He was sent to Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire from 1913 to 1914; his family&#x27;s wealth may have influenced his acceptance to the elite private school. Even though he was 17, he was admitted as a lower middleclassman, the equivalent of a sophomore. While in New England, Hawks often attended the theaters in nearby Boston. In 1914, Hawks returned to Glendora and graduated from Pasadena High School that year. Skilled in tennis, at 18 Hawks won the United States Junior Tennis Championship. That same year, Hawks was accepted to Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he majored in mechanical engineering and was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon. His college friend Ray S. Ashbury remembered Hawks spending more of his time playing craps and drinking alcohol than studying, although Hawks was also known to be a voracious reader of popular American and English novels in college.

While working in the film industry during his 1916 summer vacation, Hawks made an unsuccessful attempt to transfer to Stanford University. He returned to Cornell that September, leaving in April 1917 to join the Army when the United States entered World War I. He served as a lieutenant in the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps. During World War I, he taught aviators to fly, and these experiences influenced future aviation films like &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot; (1930). Like many college students who joined the armed services during the war, he received a degree in absentia in 1918. Before Hawks was called for active duty, he returned to Hollywood and, by the end of April 1917, was working on a Cecil B. DeMille film.

== Career ==
=== Entering films (1916–1925) ===
Howard Hawks&#x27;s interest and passion for aviation led him to many important experiences and acquaintances. In 1916, Hawks met Victor Fleming, a Hollywood cinematographer who had been an auto mechanic and early aviator. Hawks had begun racing and working on a Mercer race car—bought for him by his grandfather C.W. Howard—during his 1916 summer vacation in California. He allegedly met Fleming when the two men raced on a dirt track and caused an accident. This meeting led to Hawks&#x27;s first job in the film industry, as a prop boy on the Douglas Fairbanks film &quot;In Again, Out Again&quot; (on which Fleming was employed as the cinematographer) for Famous Players–Lasky. According to Hawks, a new set needed to be built quickly when the studio&#x27;s set designer was unavailable, so Hawks volunteered to do the job himself, much to Fairbanks&#x27;s satisfaction. He was next employed as a prop boy and general assistant on an unspecified film directed by Cecil B. DeMille. (Hawks never named the film in later interviews, and DeMille made roughly five films in that time period). By the end of April 1917, Hawks was working on Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Little American&quot;. Hawks worked on Marshall Neilan&#x27;s &quot;The Little Princess&quot;, starring Mary Pickford. According to Hawks, Neilan did not show up to work one day, so the resourceful Hawks offered to direct a scene himself, to which Pickford consented. Hawks began directing at age 21 after he and cinematographer Charles Rosher filmed a double exposure dream sequence Pickford.

Hawks worked with Pickford and Neilan again on &quot;Amarilly of Clothes-Line Alley&quot; before joining the United States Army Air Service. Hawks&#x27;s military records were destroyed in the 1973 Military Archive Fire, so the only account of his military service is his own. According to Hawks, he spent 15 weeks in basic training at the University of California in Berkeley where he was trained to be a squadron commander in the Air Service. When Pickford visited Hawks at basic training, his superior officers were so impressed by the appearance of the celebrity that they promoted him to flight instructor and sent him to Texas to teach new recruits. Bored by this work, Hawks attempted to secure a transfer during the first half of 1918 and was eventually sent to Fort Monroe, Virginia. The Armistice was signed in November of that year, and Hawks was discharged as a Second Lieutenant without having seen active duty.

After the war, Hawks was eager to return to Hollywood. His brother Kenneth Hawks, who had also served in the Air Service, graduated from Yale in 1919, and the two of them moved to Hollywood together to pursue their careers. They quickly made friends with Hollywood insider Allan Dwan. Hawks landed his first important job when he used his family&#x27;s wealth to loan money to studio head Jack L. Warner. Warner quickly paid back the loan and hired Hawks as a producer to &quot;oversee&quot; the making of a new series of one-reel comedies starring the Italian comedian Monty Banks. Hawks later stated that he personally directed &quot;three or four&quot; of the shorts, though no documentation exists to confirm the claim. The films were profitable, but Hawks soon left to form his own production company using his family&#x27;s wealth and connections to secure financing. The production company, &quot;Associated Producers&quot;, was a joint venture between Hawks, Allan Dwan, Marshall Neilan and director Allen Holubar, with a distribution deal with First National. The company made 14 films between 1920 and 1923, with eight directed by Neilan, three by Dwan and three by Holubar. More of a &quot;boy&#x27;s club&quot; than a production company, the four men gradually drifted apart and went their separate ways in 1923, by which time Hawks had decided that he wanted to direct rather than produce.

Beginning in early 1920, Hawks lived in rented houses in Hollywood with the group of friends he was accumulating. This rowdy group of mostly macho, risk-taking men included his brother Kenneth Hawks, Victor Fleming, Jack Conway, Harold Rosson, Richard Rosson, Arthur Rosson, and Eddie Sutherland. During this time, Hawks first met Irving Thalberg, the vice-president in charge of production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Hawks admired his intelligence and sense of story. Hawks also became friends with barn stormers and pioneer aviators at Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, getting to know men like Moye Stephens.

In 1923, Famous Players–Lasky president Jesse Lasky was looking for a new Production Editor in the story department of his studio, and Thalberg suggested Hawks. Hawks accepted and was immediately put in charge of over 40 productions, including several literary acquisitions of stories by Joseph Conrad, Jack London and Zane Grey. Hawks worked on the scripts for all of the films produced, but he had his first official screenplay credit in 1924 on &quot;Tiger Love&quot;. Hawks was the Story Editor at Famous Players (later Paramount Pictures) for almost two years, occasionally editing such films as &quot;Heritage of the Desert&quot;. Hawks signed a new one-year contract with Famous-Players in the fall of 1924. He broke his contract to become a story editor for Thalberg at MGM, having secured a promise from Thalberg to make him a director within a year. In 1925, when Thalberg hesitated to keep his promise, Hawks broke his contract at MGM and left.

=== Silent films (1925–1929) ===
In October 1925, Sol Wurtzel, William Fox&#x27;s studio superintendent at the Fox Film Corporation, invited Hawks to join his company with the promise of letting him direct. Over the next three years, Hawks directed his first eight films (six silent, two &quot;talkies&quot;). Hawks reworked the scripts of most of the films he directed without always taking official credit for his work. He also worked on the scripts for &quot;Honesty – The Best Policy&quot; in 1926 and Joseph von Sternberg&#x27;s &quot;Underworld&quot; in 1927, famous for being one of the first gangster films. Hawks&#x27;s first film was &quot;The Road to Glory&quot;, which premiered in April 1926. The screenplay was based on a 35-page composition written by Hawks, making it one of the only films on which Hawks had extensive writing credit. Today, it is one of Hawks&#x27;s two lost films. Immediately after completing &quot;The Road to Glory&quot;, Hawks began writing his next film, &quot;Fig Leaves&quot;, his first (and, until 1935, only) comedy. It received positive reviews, particularly for the art direction and costume designs. It was released in July 1926 and was Hawks&#x27;s first hit as a director. Although he mainly dismissed his early work, Hawks praised this film in later interviews.

&quot;Paid to Love&quot; is notable in Hawks&#x27;s filmography, because it was a highly stylized, experimental film, à la German director F. W. Murnau. Hawks&#x27;s film includes atypical tracking shots, expressionistic lighting and stylistic film editing that was inspired by German expressionist cinema. In a later interview, Hawks commented, &quot;It isn&#x27;t my type of stuff, at least I got it over in a hurry. You know the idea of wanting the camera to do those things: Now the camera&#x27;s somebody&#x27;s eyes.&quot; Hawks worked on the script with Seton I. Miller, with whom he would go on to collaborate on seven more films. The film stars George O&#x27;Brien as the introverted Crown Prince Michael, William Powell as his happy-go-lucky brother and Virginia Valli as Michael&#x27;s flapper love interest, Dolores. The characters played by Valli and O&#x27;Brien anticipate those found in later films by Hawks: a sexually aggressive showgirl, who is an early prototype of the &quot;Hawksian woman&quot;, and a shy man disinterested in sex, found in later roles played by Cary Grant and Gary Cooper. &quot;Paid to Love&quot; was completed by September 1926, but remained unreleased until July 1927. It was financially unsuccessful. &quot;Cradle Snatchers&quot; was based on a 1925 hit stage play by Russell G. Medcraft and Norma Mitchell. The film was shot in early 1927. The film was released in May 1927 and was a minor hit. It was believed to be lost until Peter Bogdanovich discovered a print in 20th Century Fox&#x27;s film vaults, although it was missing part of reel three and all of reel four. In March 1927, Hawks signed a new one-year, three-picture contract with Fox and was assigned to direct &quot;Fazil&quot;, based on the play &quot;L&#x27;Insoumise&quot; by Pierre Frondaie. Hawks again worked with Seton Miller on the script. Hawks was over schedule and over budget on the film, which began a rift between him and Sol Wurtzel that would eventually lead to Hawks leaving Fox. The film was finished in August 1927, though it was not released until June 1928.
&quot;A Girl in Every Port&quot; is considered by scholars to be the most important of Hawks&#x27;s silent films. It is the first to feature many of the themes and archetypes that would define much of his subsequent work. It was his first &quot;love story between two men&quot;, with two men bonding over their duty, skills and careers, who consider their friendship to be more important than their relationships with women. In France, Henri Langlois called Hawks &quot;the Gropius of the cinema&quot; and Swiss novelist and poet Blaise Cendrars said that the film &quot;definitely marked the first appearance of contemporary cinema.&quot; Hawks went over budget once again with this film, and his relationship with Sol Wurtzel deteriorated. After an advance screening that received positive reviews, Wurtzel told Hawks, &quot;This is the worst picture Fox has made in years.&quot; After seeing Louise Brooks in &quot;A Girl in Every Port&quot;, G. W. Pabst cast her in &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; (1929). &quot;The Air Circus&quot; was Hawks&#x27;s first film centered around aviation, one of his early passions. In 1928, Charles Lindbergh was the world&#x27;s most famous person and &quot;Wings&quot; was one of the most popular films of the year. Wanting to capitalize on the country&#x27;s aviation craze, Fox immediately bought Hawks&#x27;s original story for &quot;The Air Circus&quot;, a variation of the theme of male friendship about two young pilots. The film was shot from April to June 1928, but Fox ordered an additional 15 minutes of dialogue footage so that the film could compete with the new talkies being released. Hawks hated the new dialogue written by Hugh Herbert, and he refused to participate in the re-shoots. It was released in September 1928 and was a moderate hit and is one of two Hawks films that are lost. 

&quot;Trent&#x27;s Last Case&quot; is an adaptation of E. C. Bentley&#x27;s 1913 novel of the same name. Hawks considered the novel to be &quot;one of the greatest detective stories of all time&quot; and was eager to make it his first sound film. He cast Raymond Griffith in the lead role of Phillip Trent. Griffith&#x27;s throat had been damaged by poison gas during World War I, and his voice was a hoarse whisper, prompting Hawks to later state, &quot;I thought he ought to be great in talking pictures &quot;because&quot; of that voice.&quot; However, after shooting only a few scenes, Fox shut Hawks down and ordered him to make a silent film, both because of Griffith&#x27;s voice and because they only owned the legal rights to make a silent film. The film did have a musical score and synchronized sound effects but no dialogue. Due to the failing business of silent films, it was never released in the US and only briefly screened in England where critics hated it. The film was believed lost until the mid-1970s and was screened for the first time in the US at a Hawks retrospective in 1974. Hawks was in attendance of the screening and attempted to have the only print of the film destroyed. Hawks&#x27;s contract with Fox ended in May 1929, and he never again signed a long-term contract with a major studio. He managed to remain an independent producer-director for the rest of his long career.
=== Early sound films (1930–1934) ===
By 1930, Hollywood was in upheaval over the coming of &quot;talkies&quot;, and the careers of many actors and directors were ruined. Hollywood studios were recruiting stage actors and directors that they believed were better suited for sound films. After working in the industry for 14 years and directing many financially successful films, Hawks found he had to prove himself an asset to the studios once again. Leaving Fox on sour terms did not help his reputation, but Hawks never backed down from fights with studio heads. After several months of unemployment, Hawks renewed his career with his first sound film in 1930.
Hawks&#x27;s first all-sound film was &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot;, based on an original story by John Monk Saunders and (unofficially) Hawks. Reportedly, Hawks paid Saunders to put his name on the film, so that Hawks could direct the film without arousing concern due to his lack of writing experience. Accounts vary on who came up with the idea of the film, but Hawks and Saunders developed the story together and tried to sell it to several studios before First National agreed to produce it. Shooting began in late February 1930, about the same time that Howard Hughes was finishing his epic World War I aviation epic &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;, which had been in production since September 1927. Shrewdly, Hawks began to hire many of the aviation experts and cameramen that had been employed by Hughes, including Elmer Dyer, Harry Reynolds and Ira Reed. When Hughes found out about the rival film, he did everything he could to sabotage &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot;. He harassed Hawks and other studio personnel, hired a spy that was quickly caught, and finally sued First National for copyright infringement. Hughes eventually dropped the lawsuit in late 1930—he and Hawks had become good friends during the legal battle. Filming was finished in late May 1930, and it premiered in July, setting a first-week box office record at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York. The film became one of the biggest hits of 1930. The success of this film allowed Hawks to gain respect in the field of filmmaking and allowed him to spend the rest of his career as an independent director without the necessity to sign any long-term contracts with specific studios.
Hawks did not get along with Warner Brothers executive Hal B. Wallis, and his contract allowed him to be loaned out to other studios. Hawks took the opportunity to accept a directing offer from Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures. The film opened in January 1931 and was a hit. The film was banned in Chicago, and experienced censorship, which would continue in his next film project. In 1930, Hughes hired Hawks to direct &quot;Scarface&quot;, a gangster film loosely based on the life of Chicago mobster Al Capone. The film was completed in September 1931, but the censorship of the Hays Code prevented it from being released as Hawks and Hughes had originally intended. The two men fought, negotiated, and made compromises with the Hays Office for over a year, until the film was eventually released in 1932, after such other pivotal early gangster films as &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; and &quot;Little Caesar&quot;. &quot;Scarface&quot; was the first film on which Hawks worked with screenwriter Ben Hecht, who became a close friend and collaborator for 20 years. After filming was complete on &quot;Scarface&quot;, Hawks left Hughes to fight the legal battles and returned to First National to fulfill his contract, this time with producer Darryl F. Zanuck. For his next film, Hawks wanted to make a film about his childhood passion: car racing. Hawks developed the script for &quot;The Crowd Roars&quot; with Seton Miller for their eighth and final collaboration. Hawks used real race car drivers in the film, including the 1930 Indianapolis 500 winner Billy Arnold. The film was released in March and became a hit.
Later in 1932, he directed &quot;Tiger Shark&quot;, starring Edward G. Robinson as a tuna fisherman. In these early films, Hawks established the prototypical &quot;Hawksian Man&quot;, which film critic Andrew Sarris described as &quot;upheld by an instinctive professionalism.&quot; &quot;Tiger Shark&quot; demonstrated Hawks&#x27;s ability to incorporate touches of humor into dramatic, tense and even tragic story lines. In 1933, Hawks signed a three-picture deal at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, the first of which was &quot;Today We Live&quot; in 1933. This World War I film was based on a short story by William Faulkner. Hawks&#x27;s next two films at MGM were the boxing drama &quot;The Prizefighter and the Lady&quot; and the bio-pic &quot;Viva Villa!&quot;. Studio interference on both films led Hawks to walk out on his MGM contract without completing either film himself.

=== Later sound films (1935–1970) ===
In 1934, Hawks went to Columbia Pictures to make &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;, starring John Barrymore and Hawks&#x27;s distant cousin Carole Lombard. It was based on a stage play by Hecht and Charles MacArthur and, along with Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (released the same year), is considered to be the defining film of the screwball comedy genre. In 1935, Hawks made &quot;Barbary Coast&quot; with Edward G. Robinson and Miriam Hopkins. Hawks collaborated with Hecht and MacArthur on &quot;Barbary Coast&quot; and reportedly convinced them to work on the film by promising to teach them a marble game. They would switch off between working on the script and playing with marbles during work days. In 1936, he made the aviation adventure &quot;Ceiling Zero&quot; with James Cagney and Pat O&#x27;Brien. Also in 1936, Hawks began filming &quot;Come and Get It&quot;, starring Edward Arnold, Joel McCrea, Frances Farmer and Walter Brennan, but he was fired by Samuel Goldwyn in the middle of shooting, and the film was completed by William Wyler.

In 1938, Hawks made the screwball comedy &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; for RKO Pictures. It starred Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn and was adapted by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde. Sarris called it &quot;the screwiest of the screwball comedies&quot;. Grant plays a near-sighted paleontologist who suffers one humiliation after another due to the lovestruck socialite played by Hepburn. Hawks&#x27;s artistic direction for &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; revolved around the raw natural chemistry between Grant and Hepburn. With Grant portraying the paleontologist and Hepburn as an heiress, the roles only add to the movie&#x27;s purpose of disintegrating the line between the real and the imaginary. &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; was a box office flop when initially released and, subsequently, RKO fired Hawks due to extreme losses; however, the film has become regarded as one of Hawks&#x27;s masterpieces. Regarding Hepburn, Hawks said: &quot;We had trouble with Kate at first. The great trouble is people trying to be funny. If they don&#x27;t try to be funny, then they are funny.&quot; Hawks followed it with 11 consecutive hits up to 1951, starting with the aviation drama &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot;, made in 1939 for Columbia Pictures and starring Grant, Jean Arthur, Thomas Mitchell, Rita Hayworth and Richard Barthelmess.

Hawks returned to screwball comedy with &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940), starring Grant and Rosalind Russell and featuring Ralph Bellamy. It was an adaptation of the Broadway hit &quot;The Front Page&quot; by Hecht and MacArthur, which had been made into a film in 1931. David Thomson writes that Hawks &quot;turned &quot;The Front Page&quot; inside out – this is the first demolition re-make (a noble form). He said, suppose the editor and the reporter are a man and a woman, a married couple (just divorced), and the woman is on the point of leaving the paper to get married to a decent, wholesome, truthful idiot? Thus agreeable entertainment becomes ravishing art; thus a sentimental tribute to friendship becomes a frenzied rhapsody on the perils of being in love while guarding the love against all those plausibly &#x27;real&#x27; things.&quot; Not forgetting the influence Jesse Lasky had on his early career, in 1941, Hawks made &quot;Sergeant York&quot;, starring Gary Cooper as a pacifist farmer who becomes a decorated World War I soldier. Hawks directed the film and cast Cooper as a specific favor to Lasky. This was the highest-grossing film of 1941 and won two Academy Awards, for Best Actor and Best Editing, as well as earning Hawks his only nomination for Best Director. Later that year, Hawks worked with Cooper again for &quot;Ball of Fire&quot;, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck. The film was written by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett and is a playful take on &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. Cooper plays a sheltered, intellectual linguist who is writing an encyclopedia with six other scientists and hires street-wise Stanwyck to help them with modern slang terms. In 1941, Hawks began work on the Howard Hughes-produced (and later directed) film &quot;The Outlaw&quot;, based on the life of Billy the Kid and starring Jane Russell. Hawks completed initial shooting of the film in early 1941, but due to perfectionism and battles with the Hollywood Production Code, Hughes continued to re-shoot and re-edit the film until 1943, when it was finally released with Hawks uncredited as director.

After making the World War II film &quot;Air Force&quot; (1943), starring John Garfield and written by Nichols, Hawks did two films with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; (1944) stars Bogart, Bacall and Brennan and is based on a novel by Ernest Hemingway. Hawks was a close friend of Hemingway and made a bet with the author that he could make a good film out of Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;worst book&quot;. Hawks, William Faulkner and Jules Furthman collaborated on the script, about an American fishing boat captain working out of Martinique after the Fall of France in 1940. Bogart and Bacall fell in love on the set of the film and married soon afterwards. The greatest strength of the movie has been said to come from its atmosphere and use of wit that really plays on the strengths of Bacall and helps the movie solidify the theme of beauty in perpetual opposition. &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; is the only film with contributions from two Nobel laureates, Hemingway and Faulkner. Hawks reunited with Bogart and Bacall in 1945 and 1946 with &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, based on the Philip Marlowe detective novel by Raymond Chandler. An early 1945 version was substantially recut to comprise the final 1946 U.S. release with additional scenes emphasizing the special repartee chemistry between Bogart and Bacall. The screenplay for the film also reteamed Faulkner and Furthman, in addition to Leigh Brackett. Chandler, who had been nominated for an Oscar as co-author of the 1944 &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; screenplay, was not invited to help adapt his best selling novel. The film featured Dorothy Malone in her breakout role, in a part that was largely improvised. Hawks said of her scene: &quot;We just did it because the girl was so damn good-looking. It taught me a great lesson, that if you make a good scene, if we could do something that was fun, the audience goes right along with you.&quot; The plot is notoriously convoluted; Hawks recalled that &quot;I never figured out what was going on, but I thought the basic thing had great scenes in it, and was good entertainment. After that I said, &#x27;I&#x27;m never going to worry about being logical again.&#x27;&quot;

In 1948, Hawks made &quot;Red River&quot;, an epic Western reminiscent of &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift in his first film. Later that year, Hawks remade his &quot;Ball of Fire&quot; as &quot;A Song Is Born&quot;, this time starring Danny Kaye and Virginia Mayo. This version follows the same plot but pays more attention to popular jazz music and includes such jazz legends as Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton and Benny Carter playing themselves. In 1949, Hawks reteamed with Grant in the screwball comedy &quot;I Was a Male War Bride&quot;, also starring Ann Sheridan.
In 1951, Hawks produced, and according to some, directed, a science-fiction film, &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;. Director John Carpenter stated: &quot;And let&#x27;s get the record straight. The movie was directed by Howard Hawks. Verifiably directed by Howard Hawks. He let his editor, Christian Nyby, take credit. But the kind of feeling between the male characters—the camaraderie, the group of men that has to fight off the evil—it&#x27;s all pure Hawksian.&quot; He followed this with the 1952 Western &quot;The Big Sky&quot;, starring Kirk Douglas. Later in 1952, Hawks worked with Grant for the fifth and final time in the screwball comedy &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, which also starred Marilyn Monroe and Ginger Rogers. Grant plays a scientist (reminiscent of his character in &quot;Bringing up Baby&quot;) who creates a formula that increases his vitality. Film critic John Belton called the film Hawks&#x27;s &quot;most organic comedy&quot;. Hawks&#x27;s third film of 1952 was a contribution to the omnibus film &quot;O. Henry&#x27;s Full House&quot;, which includes short stories by the writer O. Henry made by various directors. Hawks&#x27;s short film &quot;The Ransom of Red Chief&quot; starred Fred Allen, Oscar Levant and Jeanne Crain.

In 1953, Hawks made &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;, which famously featured Marilyn Monroe singing &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;. The film starred Monroe and Jane Russell as two cabaret performing best friends; many critics argue that the film is the only female version of the &quot;buddy film&quot; genre. Choreographer Jack Cole is generally credited with staging the musical numbers while Hawks is credited with directing the non-musical scenes. In 1955, Hawks made &quot;Land of the Pharaohs&quot;, a sword-and-sandal epic about ancient Egypt that stars Jack Hawkins and Joan Collins. The film was Hawks&#x27;s final collaboration with longtime friend William Faulkner. In 1959, Hawks worked with John Wayne in &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;, also starring Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson and Walter Brennan as four lawmen &quot;defending the fort&quot; of their local jail in which a local criminal is awaiting a trial while his family attempt to break him out. The screenplay was written by Furthman and Leigh Brackett, who had collaborated with Hawks previously on &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;. Film critic Robin Wood has said that if he &quot;were asked to choose a film that would justify the existence of Hollywood ... it would be &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;.&quot;
In 1962, Hawks made &quot;Hatari!&quot;, again with Wayne, who plays a wild animal catcher in Africa. It was also written by Leigh Brackett. Hawks&#x27;s knowledge of mechanics allowed him to build the camera-car hybrid that allowed him to film the hunting scenes in the film. In 1964, Hawks made his final comedy, &quot;Man&#x27;s Favorite Sport?&quot;, starring Rock Hudson (since Cary Grant felt he was too old for the role) and Paula Prentiss. Hawks then returned to his childhood passion for car races with &quot;Red Line 7000&quot; in 1965, featuring a young James Caan in his first leading role. Hawks&#x27;s final two films were both Western remakes of &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; starring John Wayne and written by Leigh Brackett. In 1966, Hawks directed &quot;El Dorado&quot;, starring Wayne, Robert Mitchum, and Caan, which was released the following year. He then made &quot;Rio Lobo&quot;, with Wayne in 1970. After &quot;Rio Lobo&quot;, Hawks planned a project relating to Ernest Hemingway and &quot;Now, Mr. Gus&quot;, a comedy about two male friends seeking oil and money. He died in December 1977, before these projects were completed.

== Personal life ==

Howard Hawks was married three times: to actress Athole Shearer, sister of Norma Shearer, from 1928 to 1940; to socialite and fashion icon Slim Keith from 1941 to 1949; and to actress Dee Hartford from 1953 to 1959. Hawks had two children with Shearer, Barbara and David. David Hawks worked as an assistant director for the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. His second daughter, Kitty Hawks, was a result of his second marriage to &quot;Slim&quot; Keith. Hawks had one son with his last wife, Dee Hartford, who was named Gregg after cinematographer Gregg Toland.

Along with his love of flying machines, Hawks also had a passion for cars and motorcycles. He built the race car that won the 1936 Indianapolis 500, as well as enjoyed riding motorcycles with Barbara Stanwyck and Gary Cooper. Hawks and his son Gregg were members of Checkers Motorcycle Club. Hawks continued riding until the age of 78. His other hobbies included golf, tennis, sailing, horse racing, carpentry, and silversmithing.

Hawks was also known for maintaining close friendships with many American writers such as Ben Hecht, Ernest Hemingway, and William Faulkner. Hawks credited himself with the discovery of William Faulkner and introducing the then-unknown writer to the Algonquin Round Table. Hawks and Faulkner had mutual interests in flying and drinking, and Faulkner admired the films of Hawks, asking Hawks to teach him how to write screenplays. Faulkner wrote five screenplays for Hawks, the first being &quot;Today We Live&quot; and the last being &quot;Land of the Pharaohs&quot;. With a mutual interest in fishing and skiing, Hawks was also close with Ernest Hemingway and was almost made the director of the film adaptation of &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. Hawks found it difficult to forgive Hemingway for his suicide. After coming to terms with it in the 1970s, he began to plan a film project about Hemingway and his relationship with Robert Capa. He never filmed the project.

Hawks supported Thomas Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election.

==Later life and death==
By the mid-1970s, Hawks&#x27;s health began to decline, though he remained active. In addition to being in the early stages of Parkinson&#x27;s disease in the years leading up to his death, an injury suffered on the set of &quot;Rio Lobo&quot; severely damaged one of his legs.

Hawks died on December 26, 1977, at the age of 81, from complications arising from a fall when he tripped over his dog at his home in Palm Springs, California. He had spent two weeks in the hospital recovering from his concussion when he asked to be taken home, dying a few days later. His death was attributed directly to &quot;arteriosclerotic vascular disease with stroke&quot;. He was working with his last protégée discovery at the time, Larraine Zax.

== Style ==

Hawks was a versatile director whose career includes comedies, dramas, gangster films, science fiction, film noir, and Westerns. Hawks&#x27;s own functional definition of what constitutes a good film is characteristic of his no-nonsense style: &quot;three good scenes, and no bad ones.&quot; Hawks also defined a good director as &quot;someone who doesn&#x27;t annoy you&quot;. He described his style: “I try to tell my story as simply as possible, with the camera at eye level. I just imagine the way the story should be told, and I do it.” His style was very actor-focused, and he made it a point to take as few shots as possible, thereby preserving an inherent and natural humor for his comedic pieces.

While Hawks was not sympathetic to feminism, he popularized the Hawksian woman archetype, a portrayal of women in stronger, less effeminate roles. Such an emphasis had never been done in the 1920s and therefore was seen to be a rarity and, according to Naomi Wise, has been cited as a prototype of the post-feminist movement. Another notable theme carried throughout his work included the relationship of morality and human interaction. In this sense, he tended to portray more dramatic elements of a concept or a plot in a humorous way.

Orson Welles, in conversation with Peter Bogdanovich, compared Hawks with John Ford: &quot;Hawks is great prose; Ford is poetry.&quot; Hawks cited Ford as an influence: &quot;He was a good director when I started, and I copied him every time I could. It&#x27;s just as if you were a writer, you would read Hemingway and Faulkner and John Dos Passos and Willa Cather.&quot; Despite Hawks&#x27;s work in a variety of Hollywood genres, he still retained an independent sensibility. Film critic David Thomson wrote of Hawks: &quot;Far from the meek purveyor of Hollywood forms, he always chose to turn them upside down. &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; and &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, ostensibly an adventure and a thriller, are really love stories. &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;, apparently a Western – everyone wears a cowboy hat – is a comedy conversation piece. The ostensible comedies are shot through with exposed emotions, with the subtlest views of the sex war, and with a wry acknowledgment of the incompatibility of men and women.&quot; David Boxwell argues that the filmmaker&#x27;s body of work &quot;has been accused of a historical and adolescent escapism, but Hawks&#x27;s fans rejoice in his oeuvre&#x27;s remarkable avoidance of Hollywood&#x27;s religiosity, bathos, flag-waving, and sentimentality.

== Writing and producing ==
In addition to his career as a film director, Howard Hawks either wrote or supervised the writing for most of his films. In some cases, he would rewrite parts of the script on set. Due to the Screen Writer&#x27;s Guild&#x27;s rule that the director and producer couldn&#x27;t receive credit for writing, Hawks rarely received credit. Even though Sidney Howard received credit for writing &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), the screenplay was actually written by a myriad of Hollywood screenwriters including, David O. Selznick, Ben Hecht, and Howard Hawks. Hawks was an uncredited contributor to many other screenplays such as &quot;Underworld&quot; (1927), &quot;Morocco&quot; (1930), &quot;Shanghai Express&quot; (1932), and &quot;Gunga Din&quot; (1939). Hawks also produced many of his own films, preferring not to work under major film studios, because it allowed him creative freedom in his writing, directing, and casting. Hawks would sometimes walk out on films that he wasn&#x27;t producing himself. Hawks, however, never considered producing to come before his directing. For example, several of the film cards for his films show &quot;Directed and produced by Howard Hawks&quot; with &quot;produced&quot; underneath &quot;directed&quot; in much smaller font. Sometimes his films wouldn&#x27;t credit any producer. Hawks discovered many well known film stars such as Paul Muni, George Raft, Ann Dvorak, Carole Lombard, Frances Farmer, Jane Russell, Montgomery Clift, Joanne Dru, Angie Dickinson, James Caan, and most famously, Lauren Bacall.

== Filmography ==
== Awards and recognition ==
In 1962, Peter Bogdanovich suggested that the Museum of Modern Art to do a retrospective on Howard Hawks, who was in the process of releasing &quot;Hatari!&quot; For marketing purposes, Paramount paid for part of the exhibition, which traveled to Paris and London. For the event, Bogdanovich prepared a monograph. As a result of the retrospective, a special edition of &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; was published, and Hawks was featured in his own issue of &quot;Movie&quot; magazine.

In 1996, Howard Hawks was voted No. 4 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list of 50 greatest directors. In 2007, &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine ranked Hawks as No. 4 in its &quot;100 Greatest Film Directors Ever&quot; list. &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938) was listed number 97 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies. On the AFI&#x27;s AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; was listed number 14, &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940) was listed number 19 and &quot;Ball of Fire&quot; (1941) was listed number 92. In the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls of the greatest films ever made, six films directed by Hawks were in the critics&#x27; top 250 films: &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (number 63), &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (number 110), &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot; (number 154), &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (number 171), &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (number 202), and &quot;Red River&quot; (number 235). Six of his films currently hold a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. His films &quot;Ball of Fire&quot;, &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;, &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;, &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot;, &quot;Red River&quot;, &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;, &quot;Scarface&quot;, &quot;Sergeant York&quot;, &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;, and &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; were deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and inducted into the National Film Registry. With eleven films, he ties with John Ford for directing the most films that are in the registry.

From the film industry, he received three nominations for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures from the Directors Guild of America for &quot;Red River&quot; in 1949, &quot;The Big Sky&quot; in 1953, and &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; in 1960. He was inducted into the Online Film and Television Association&#x27;s Hall of Fame for his directing in 2005. For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Howard Hawks has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1708 Vine Street. He was nominated for Academy Award for Best Director in 1942 for &quot;Sergeant York&quot;, but he received his only Oscar in 1974 as an Honorary Award from the academy. He was cited as &quot;a giant of the American cinema whose pictures, taken as a whole, represent one of the most consistent, vivid, and varied bodies of work in world cinema&quot; and &quot;a master filmmaker whose creative efforts hold a distinguished place in world cinema.&quot;

== Influence and legacy ==
In the 1950s, Eugene Archer, a film fan, was planning on writing a book on important American film directors such as John Ford. However, after reading &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;, Archer learned that the French film scene was more interested in Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks. Books were not written on Hawks until the 1960s, and a full biography on Hawks wasn&#x27;t published until 1997, twenty years after his death. Film critic Andrew Sarris cited Howard Hawks as &quot;the least known and least appreciated Hollywood director of any stature&quot;. According to professor of film studies Ian Brookes, Hawks is not as well known as other directors, because of his lack of association with a particular genre such as Ford with Westerns and Hitchcock with thrillers. Hawks worked across many genres including gangster, film noir, musical comedy, romantic comedy, screwball comedy, Western, aviation, and combat. Moreover, Hawks preferred not to associate with major studios during his film production. He worked for all major studios at least once on short-term contract, but many of his films were produced under his own name. The simplicity of his narratives and stories may also have contributed to his under-recognition. Commercially, his films were successful, but he received little critical acclaim except for one Academy Award nomination for Best Director for &quot;Sergeant York&quot; (he lost to John Ford for &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;) and an Honorary Academy Award presented to him two years before his death.

Some critics limit Hawks by his action films, describing Hawks as a director who produced films with a &quot;masculine bias&quot;, however action scenes in Hawks&#x27;s films were often left to second-unit directors, and Hawks actually preferred to work indoors. Howard Hawks&#x27;s style is difficult to interpret because there is no recognizable relationship between his visual and narrative style as in the films of his contemporary directors. Because his camera style was derived more from his working method rather than anecdotal or visual realization, his camera work is unobtrusive, making his films appear to have little to no cinematographic style. Hawks&#x27;s style can, rather, be characterized as improvisational and collaborative. Hawks&#x27;s directorial style and the use of natural, conversational dialogue in his films are cited as major influences on many noted filmmakers, including Robert Altman John Carpenter, and Quentin Tarantino. His work is also admired by Peter Bogdanovich, Martin Scorsese, François Truffaut, Michael Mann, and Jacques Rivette. Andrew Sarris in his influential book of film criticism &quot;The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929–1968&quot; included Hawks in the &quot;pantheon&quot; of the 14 greatest film directors who had worked in the United States. Brian De Palma dedicated his version of &quot;Scarface&quot; to Hawks and Ben Hecht. Altman was influenced by the fast-paced dialogue of &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; in &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and subsequent productions. Hawks was nicknamed &quot;The Gray Fox&quot; by members of the Hollywood community, thanks to his prematurely gray hair.

Hawks has been considered by some film critics to be an auteur both because of his recognizable style and frequent use of specific thematic elements, and because of his attention to all aspects of his films, not merely directing. Hawks was venerated by French critics associated with &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;, who intellectualized his work in a way that Hawks himself found moderately amusing (his work was promoted in France by The Studio des Ursulines cinema). Although he was not at first taken seriously by British critics of the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; circle, other independent British writers, such as Robin Wood, admired his films. Wood named Hawks&#x27;s &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; as his top film of all time. David Thomson writes that &quot;There was an absurdist in Hawks, and a Nabokovian delight in the game for its own sake. Thus, in a very important way, this seeming American may have been against the grain of his time and place. That may help explain why the films grow in wonder.&quot;

<text>The concept of Germany as a distinct region in Central Europe can be traced to Julius Caesar, who referred to the unconquered area east of the Rhine as &quot;Germania&quot;, thus distinguishing it from Gaul. The victory of the Germanic tribes in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (AD 9) prevented annexation by the Roman Empire, although the Roman provinces of Germania Superior and Germania Inferior were established along the Rhine. Following the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Franks conquered the other West Germanic tribes. When the Frankish Empire was divided among Charles the Great&#x27;s heirs in 843, the eastern part became East Francia, and later Kingdom of Germany. In 962, Otto I became the first Holy Roman Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, the medieval German state.

During the High Middle Ages, the Hanseatic League, dominated by German port cities, established itself along the Baltic and North Seas. The growth of a crusading element within German Christendom led to the State of the Teutonic Order along the Baltic coast in what would later become Prussia. In the Investiture Controversy, the German Emperors resisted Catholic Church authority. In the Late Middle Ages, the regional dukes, princes, and bishops gained power at the expense of the emperors. Martin Luther led the Protestant Reformation within the Catholic Church after 1517, as the northern and eastern states became Protestant, while most of the southern and western states remained Catholic. The Thirty Years&#x27; War, a civil war from 1618 to 1648 brought tremendous destruction to the Holy Roman Empire. The estates of the empire attained great autonomy in the Peace of Westphalia, the most important being Austria, Prussia, Bavaria and Saxony. With the Napoleonic Wars, feudalism fell away and the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806. Napoleon established the Confederation of the Rhine as a German puppet state, but after the French defeat, the German Confederation was established under Austrian presidency. The German revolutions of 1848–1849 failed but the Industrial Revolution modernized the German economy, leading to rapid urban growth and the emergence of the socialist movement. Prussia, with its capital Berlin, grew in power. German universities became world-class centers for science and humanities, while music and art flourished. The unification of Germany was achieved under the leadership of the Chancellor Otto von Bismarck with the formation of the German Empire in 1871. The new &quot;Reichstag&quot;, an elected parliament, had only a limited role in the imperial government. Germany joined the other powers in colonial expansion in Africa and the Pacific.

By 1900, Germany was the dominant power on the European continent and its rapidly expanding industry had surpassed Britain&#x27;s while provoking it in a naval arms race. Germany led the Central Powers in World War I, but was defeated, partly occupied, forced to pay war reparations, and stripped of its colonies and significant territory along its borders. The German Revolution of 1918–1919 ended the German Empire with the abdication of Wilhelm II in 1918 and established the Weimar Republic, an ultimately unstable parliamentary democracy. In January 1933, Adolf Hitler, leader of the Nazi Party, used the economic hardships of the Great Depression along with popular resentment over the terms imposed on Germany at the end of World War I to establish a totalitarian regime. This Nazi Germany made racism, especially antisemitism, a central tenet of its policies, and became increasingly aggressive with its territorial demands, threatening war if they were not met. Germany quickly remilitarized, annexed its German-speaking neighbors and invaded Poland, triggering World War II. During the war, the Nazis established a systematic genocide program known as the Holocaust which killed 11 million people, including 6 million Jews (representing 2/3rds of the European Jewish population). By 1944, the German Army was pushed back on all fronts until finally collapsing in May 1945. Under occupation by the Allies, denazification efforts took place, large populations under former German-occupied territories were displaced, German territories were split up by the victorious powers and in the east annexed by Poland and the Soviet Union. Germany spent the entirety of the Cold War era divided into the NATO-aligned West Germany and Warsaw Pact-aligned East Germany. Germans also fled from Communist areas into West Germany, which experienced rapid economic expansion, and became the dominant economy in Western Europe.

In 1989, the Berlin Wall was opened, the Eastern Bloc collapsed, and East and West Germany were reunited in 1990. The Franco-German friendship became the basis for the political integration of Western Europe in the European Union. In 1998–1999, Germany was one of the founding countries of the eurozone. Germany remains one of the economic powerhouses of Europe, contributing about 1/4 of the eurozone&#x27;s annual gross domestic product. In the early 2010s, Germany played a critical role in trying to resolve the escalating euro crisis, especially concerning Greece and other Southern European nations. In 2015, Germany faced the European migrant crisis as the main receiver of asylum seekers from Syria and other troubled regions. Germany opposed Russia&#x27;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine and decided to strengthen its armed forces.

==Prehistory==
===Paleolithic and Neolithic ages===

Pre-human apes such as Danuvius guggenmosi, who were present in Germany over 11 million years ago, are theorized to be among the earliest apes to walk on two legs prior to other species and genera such as Australopithecus. The discovery of the Homo heidelbergensis mandible in 1907 affirms archaic human presence in Germany by at least 600,000 years ago, so stone tools were dated as far back as 1.33 million years ago. The oldest complete set of hunting weapons ever found anywhere in the world was excavated from a coal mine in Schöningen, Lower Saxony. Between 1994 and 1998, eight 380,000-year-old wooden javelins between in length were eventually unearthed.
One of the oldest buildings in the world and one of the oldest pieces of art was found in Bilzingsleben.

In 1856, the fossilized bones of an extinct human species were salvaged from a limestone grotto in the Neander valley near Düsseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia. The archaic nature of the fossils, now known to be around 40,000 years old, was recognized and the characteristics published in the first-ever paleoanthropologic species description in 1858 by Hermann Schaaffhausen. The species was named &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot;, Neanderthal man in 1864.

The oldest traces of homo sapiens in Germany were found in the cave in Ranis, where up to 47,500-year-old remains were discovered, among the oldest in Europe. The remains of Paleolithic early modern human occupation uncovered and documented in several caves in the Swabian Jura include various mammoth ivory sculptures that rank among the oldest uncontested works of art and several flutes, made of bird bone and mammoth ivory that are confirmed to be the oldest musical instruments ever found. The 41,000-year-old Löwenmensch figurine represents the oldest uncontested figurative work of art and the 40,000-year-old Venus of Hohle Fels has been asserted as the oldest uncontested object of human figurative art ever discovered. These artefacts are attributed to the Aurignacian culture.

Between 12,900 and 11,700 years ago, north-central Germany was part of the Ahrensburg culture (named for Ahrensburg).

The first groups of early farmers different from the indigenous hunter-gatherers to migrate into Europe came from a population in western Anatolia at the beginning of the Neolithic period between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago.

Central Germany was one of the primary areas of the Linear Pottery culture (), which was partially contemporary with the Ertebølle culture () of Denmark and northern Germany. The construction of the Central European Neolithic circular enclosures falls in this time period with the best known and oldest being the Goseck circle, constructed . Afterwards, Germany was part of the Rössen culture, Michelsberg culture and Funnelbeaker culture (). The oldest traces for the use of wheel and wagon ever found are located at a northern German Funnelbeaker culture site and date to around 3400 BC.

===Bronze Age===

The settlers of the Corded Ware culture (), that had spread all over the fertile plains of Central Europe during the Late Neolithic were of Indo-European ancestry. The Indo-Europeans had, via mass-migration, arrived into the heartland of Europe around 4,500 years ago.

By the late Bronze Age, the Urnfield culture () had replaced the Bell Beaker, Unetice and Tumulus cultures in central Europe, whilst the Nordic Bronze Age had developed in Scandinavia and northern Germany. The name comes from the custom of cremating the dead and placing their ashes in urns, which were then buried in fields. The first usage of the name occurred in publications over grave sites in southern Germany in the late 19th century. Over much of Europe, the Urnfield culture followed the Tumulus culture and was succeeded by the Hallstatt culture. The Italic peoples, including the Latins, from which the Romans emerged, come from the Urnfield culture of central Europe.
===Iron Age===

The Hallstatt culture, which had developed from the Urnfield culture, was the predominant Western and Central European culture from the 12th to 8th centuries BC and during the early Iron Age (8th to 6th centuries BC). It was followed by the La Tène culture (5th to 1st centuries BC).

The people who had adopted these cultural characteristics in central and southern Germany are regarded as Celts. How and if the Celts are related to the Urnfield culture remains disputed. However, Celtic cultural centres developed in central Europe during the late Bronze Age ( until 700 BC). Some, like the Heuneburg, the oldest city north of the Alps, grew to become important cultural centres of the Iron Age in Central Europe, that maintained trade routes to the Mediterranean. In the 5th century BC the Greek historian Herodotus mentioned a Celtic city at the Danube – &quot;Pyrene&quot;, that historians attribute to the Heuneburg. Beginning around 700 BC (or later), Germanic peoples (Germanic tribes) from southern Scandinavia and northern Germany expanded south and gradually replaced the Celtic peoples in Central Europe.
==Early history: Germanic tribes, Roman conquests, and the Migration Period==

===Early migrations, the Suebi and the Roman Republic===
The ethnogenesis of the Germanic tribes remains debated. However, for author Averil Cameron &quot;it is obvious that a steady process&quot; occurred during the Nordic Bronze Age, or at the latest during the Pre-Roman Iron Age (Jastorf culture). From their homes in southern Scandinavia and northern Germany the tribes began expanding south, east and west during the 1st century BC, and came into contact with the Celtic tribes of Gaul, as well as with Iranic, Baltic, and Slavic cultures in Central/Eastern Europe.

Factual and detailed knowledge about the early history of the Germanic tribes is rare. Researchers have to be content with the recordings of the tribes&#x27; affairs with the Romans, linguistic conclusions, archaeological discoveries and the rather new yet auspicious results of archaeogenetic study. In the mid-1st century BC, Republican Roman statesman Julius Caesar erected the first known bridges across the Rhine during his campaign in Gaul and led a military contingent across and into the territories of the local Germanic tribes. After several days and having made no contact with Germanic troops (who had retreated inland) Caesar returned to the west of the river. By 60 BC, the Suebi tribe under chieftain Ariovistus, had conquered lands of the Gallic Aedui tribe to the west of the Rhine. Consequent plans to populate the region with Germanic settlers from the east were vehemently opposed by Caesar, who had already launched his ambitious campaign to subjugate all Gaul. Julius Caesar defeated the Suebi forces in 58 BC in the Battle of Vosges and forced Ariovistus to retreat across the Rhine.

===Roman settlement of the Rhine===

Augustus, first Roman emperor, considered conquest beyond the Rhine and the Danube not only regular foreign policy but also necessary to counter Germanic incursions into a still rebellious Gaul. Forts and commercial centers were established along the rivers. Some tribes, such as the Ubii consequently allied with Rome and readily adopted advanced Roman culture. During the 1st century CE Roman legions conducted extended campaigns into Germania magna, the area north of the Upper Danube and east of the Rhine, attempting to subdue the various tribes. Roman ideas of administration, the imposition of taxes and a legal framework were frustrated by the total absence of an infrastructure. Germanicus&#x27;s campaigns, for example, were almost exclusively characterized by frequent massacres of villagers and indiscriminate pillaging. The tribes, however maintained their elusive identities. A coalition of tribes under the Cherusci chieftain Arminius, who was familiar with Roman tactical doctrines, defeated a large Roman force in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Consequently, Rome resolved to permanently establish the Rhine/Danube border and refrain from further territorial advance into Germania. By AD 100 the frontier along the Rhine and the Danube and the Limes Germanicus was firmly established. Several Germanic tribes lived under Roman rule south and west of the border, as described in Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot;. Austria formed the regular provinces of Noricum and Raetia. The provinces Germania Inferior (with the capital situated at Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, modern Cologne) and Germania Superior (with its capital at Mogontiacum, modern Mainz), were formally established in 85 AD, after long campaigns as lasting military control was confined to the lands surrounding the rivers. Christianity was introduced to Roman controlled western Germania before the Middle Ages, with Christian religious structures such as the Aula Palatina of Trier built during the reign of Constantine I ().

=== Migration Period and decline of the Western Roman Empire ===
Rome&#x27;s Third Century Crisis coincided with the emergence of a number of large West Germanic tribes: the Alamanni, Franks, Bavarii, Chatti, Saxons, Frisii, Sicambri, and Thuringii. By the 3rd century the Germanic speaking peoples began to migrate beyond the &quot;limes&quot; and the Danube frontier. Several large tribes – the Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Vandals, Burgundians, Lombards, Saxons and Franks – migrated and played their part in the decline of the Roman Empire and the transformation of the old Western Roman Empire. By the end of the 4th century the Huns invaded eastern and central Europe, establishing the Hunnic Empire. The event triggered the Migration Period. Hunnic hegemony over a vast territory in central and eastern Europe lasted until the death of Attila&#x27;s son Dengizich in 469. Another pivotal moment in the Migration Period was the Crossing of the Rhine in December of 406 by a large group of tribes including Vandals, Alans and Suebi who settled permanently within the crumbling Western Roman Empire.

=== Stem duchies and marches ===
Stem duchies () in Germany refer to the traditional territory of the various Germanic tribes. The concept of such duchies survived especially in the areas which by the 9th century would constitute East Francia, which included the Duchy of Bavaria, the Duchy of Swabia, the Duchy of Saxony, the Duchy of Franconia and the Duchy of Thuringia, unlike further west the County of Burgundy or Lorraine in Middle Francia.
The Salian emperors (reigned 1027–1125) retained the stem duchies as the major divisions of Germany, but they became increasingly obsolete during the early high-medieval period under the Hohenstaufen, and Frederick Barbarossa finally abolished them in 1180 in favour of more numerous territorial duchies.

Successive kings of Germany founded a series of border counties or marches in the east and the north. These included Lusatia, the North March (which would become Brandenburg and the heart of the future Prussia), and the Billung March. In the south, the marches included Carniola, Styria, and the March of Austria that would become Austria.

==Middle Ages==
===Frankish Empire===

The Western Roman Empire fell in 476 with the deposition of Romulus Augustus by the Germanic &quot;foederati&quot; leader Odoacer, who became the first King of Italy. Afterwards, the Franks, like other post-Roman Western Europeans, emerged as a tribal confederacy in the Middle Rhine-Weser region, among the territory soon to be called Austrasia (the &quot;eastern land&quot;), the northeastern portion of the future Kingdom of the Merovingian Franks. As a whole, Austrasia comprised parts of present-day France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Unlike the Alamanni to their south in Swabia, they absorbed large swaths of former Roman territory as they spread west into Gaul, beginning in 250. Clovis I of the Merovingian dynasty conquered northern Gaul in 486 and in the Battle of Tolbiac in 496 the Alemanni tribe in Swabia, which eventually became the Duchy of Swabia.

By 500, Clovis had united all the Frankish tribes, ruled all of Gaul and was proclaimed &quot;King of the Franks&quot; between 509 and 511. Clovis, unlike most Germanic rulers of the time, was baptized directly into Roman Catholicism instead of Arianism. His successors would cooperate closely with papal missionaries, among them Saint Boniface. After the death of Clovis in 511, his four sons partitioned his kingdom including Austrasia. Authority over Austrasia passed back and forth from autonomy to royal subjugation, as successive Merovingian kings alternately united and subdivided the Frankish lands.

During the 5th and 6th centuries the Merovingian kings conquered the Thuringii (531 to 532), the Kingdom of the Burgundians and the principality of Metz and defeated the Danes, the Saxons and the Visigoths. King Chlothar I (558 to 561) ruled the greater part of what is now Germany and undertook military expeditions into Saxony, while the South-east of what is modern Germany remained under the influence of the Ostrogoths. Saxons controlled the area from the northern sea board to the Harz Mountains and the Eichsfeld in the south.

The Merovingians placed the various regions of their Frankish Empire under the control of semi-autonomous dukes – either Franks or local rulers, and followed imperial Roman strategic traditions of social and political integration of the newly conquered territories. While allowed to preserve their own legal systems, the conquered Germanic tribes were pressured to abandon the Arian Christian faith.

In 718 Charles Martel waged war against the Saxons in support of the Neustrians. In 743 his son Carloman in his role as Mayor of the Palace renewed the war against the Saxons, who had allied with and aided the duke Odilo of Bavaria. The Catholic Franks, who by 750 controlled a vast territory in Gaul, north-western Germany, Swabia, Burgundy and western Switzerland, that included the alpine passes allied with the Curia in Rome against the Lombards, who posed a permanent threat to the Holy See. Pressed by Liutprand, King of the Lombards, a Papal envoy for help had already been sent to the de facto ruler Charles Martel after his victory in 732 over the forces of the Umayyad Caliphate at the Battle of Tours, however a lasting and mutually beneficial alliance would only materialize after Charles&#x27; death under his successor Duke of the Franks, Pepin the Short.

In 751 Pippin III, Mayor of the Palace under the Merovingian king, himself assumed the title of king and was anointed by the Church. Pope Stephen II bestowed him the hereditary title of &quot;Patricius Romanorum&quot; as protector of Rome and St. Peter in response to the Donation of Pepin, that guaranteed the sovereignty of the Papal States. Charles the Great (who ruled the Franks from 774 to 814) launched a decades-long military campaign against the Franks&#x27; heathen rivals, the Saxons and the Avars. The campaigns and insurrections of the Saxon Wars lasted from 772 to 804. The Franks eventually overwhelmed the Saxons and Avars, forcibly converted the people to Christianity, and annexed their lands to the Carolingian Empire.

===Foundation of the Holy Roman Empire===
After the death of Frankish king Pepin the Short in 768, his oldest son &quot;Charlemagne&quot; (&quot;Charles the Great&quot;) consolidated his power over and expanded the Kingdom. Charlemagne ended 200 years of Royal Lombard rule with the Siege of Pavia, and in 774 he installed himself as King of the Lombards. Loyal Frankish nobles replaced the old Lombard aristocracy following a rebellion in 776. The next 30 years of his reign were spent ruthlessly strengthening his power in Francia and on the conquest of the Slavs and Pannonian Avars in the east and all tribes, such as the Saxons and the Bavarians. On Christmas Day, 800 AD, Charlemagne was crowned &quot;Imperator Romanorum&quot; (Emperor of the Romans) in Rome by Pope Leo III.

Fighting among Charlemagne&#x27;s three grandsons over the continuation of the custom of partible inheritance or the introduction of primogeniture caused the Carolingian empire to be partitioned into three parts by the Treaty of Verdun of 843. Louis the German received the Eastern portion of the kingdom, East Francia, all lands east of the Rhine river and to the north of Italy. This encompassed the territories of the German stem duchies – Franks, Saxons, Swabians, and Bavarians – that were united in a federation under the first non-Frankish king Henry the Fowler, who ruled from 919 to 936. The royal court permanently moved in between a series of strongholds, called &quot;Kaiserpfalzen&quot;, that developed into economic and cultural centers. Aachen Palace played a central role, as the local Palatine Chapel served as the official site for all royal coronation ceremonies during the entire medieval period until 1531.
=== Ottonian dynasty ===

In 936, Otto I was crowned German king at Aachen, in 961 &quot;King of Italy&quot; in Pavia and crowned emperor by Pope John XII in Rome in 962. The tradition of the German King as protector of the Kingdom of Italy and the Latin Church resulted in the term Holy Roman Empire in the 12th century. The name, that was to identify with Germany continued to be used officially, with the extension added: &quot;Nationis Germanicæ (of the German nation)&quot; after the last imperial coronation in Rome in 1452 until its dissolution in 1806. Otto strengthened the royal authority by re-asserting the old Carolingian rights over ecclesiastical appointments. Otto wrested from the nobles the powers of appointment of the bishops and abbots, who controlled large land holdings. Additionally, Otto revived the old Carolingian program of appointing missionaries in the border lands. Otto continued to support celibacy for the higher clergy, so ecclesiastical appointments never became hereditary. By granting lands to the abbots and bishops he appointed, Otto actually turned these bishops into &quot;princes of the Empire&quot; (&quot;Reichsfürsten&quot;). In this way, Otto was able to establish a national church. Outside threats to the kingdom were contained with the decisive defeat of the Hungarian Magyars at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955. The Slavs between the Elbe and the Oder rivers were also subjugated. Otto marched on Rome and drove John XII from the papal throne and for years controlled the election of the pope, setting a firm precedent for imperial control of the papacy for years to come.
Otto I was followed on the throne by his son Otto II (955–983), emperor 973–983, Otto II&#x27;s wife Theophanu (955–991), regent 983–991, his own wife Adelaide of Italy (931–999), regent 991–995, and his grandson Otto III (980–1002), emperor 996–1002. Otto III died childless and was succeeded by his second cousin Henry II, who likewise died childless as the last emperor of the Ottonian dynasty.

=== Salian dynasty ===
Henry II was succeeded by Conrad II, a great-great-grandson of Otto I and the first emperor of the Salian dynasty. During the reign of Conrad II&#x27;s son, Henry III (1039 to 1056), the empire supported the Cluniac reforms of the Church, the Peace of God, prohibition of simony (the purchase of clerical offices), and required celibacy of priests. Imperial authority over the Pope reached its peak. However, Rome reacted with the creation of the College of Cardinals and Pope Gregory VII&#x27;s series of clerical reforms. Pope Gregory insisted in his &quot;Dictatus Papae&quot; on absolute papal authority over appointments to ecclesiastical offices. The subsequent conflict in which emperor Henry IV was compelled to submit to the Pope at Canossa in 1077, after having been excommunicated came to be known as the Investiture Controversy. In 1122, a temporary reconciliation was reached between Henry V and the Pope with the Concordat of Worms. With the conclusion of the dispute the Roman church and the papacy regained supreme control over all religious affairs. Consequently, the imperial Ottonian church system (&quot;Reichskirche&quot;) declined. It also ended the royal/imperial tradition of appointing selected powerful clerical leaders to counter the Imperial secular princes.

Between 1095 and 1291 the various campaigns of the crusades to the Holy Land took place. Knightly religious orders were established, including the Knights Templar, the Knights of St John (Knights Hospitaller), and the Teutonic Order.

The term &quot;sacrum imperium&quot; (Holy Empire) was first used officially by Friedrich I in 1157, but the words &quot;Sacrum Romanum Imperium&quot;, Holy Roman Empire, were only combined in July 1180 and would never consistently appear on official documents from 1254 onwards.

===Hanseatic League===


The Hanseatic League was a commercial and defensive alliance of the merchant guilds of towns and cities in northern and central Europe that dominated marine trade in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and along the connected navigable rivers during the Late Middle Ages ( 12th to 15th centuries ). Each of the affiliated cities retained the legal system of its sovereign and, with the exception of the Free imperial cities, had only a limited degree of political autonomy. Beginning with an agreement of the cities of Lübeck and Hamburg, guilds cooperated in order to strengthen and combine their economic assets, like securing trading routes and tax privileges, to control prices and better protect and market their local commodities. Important centers of commerce within the empire, such as Cologne on the Rhine river and Bremen on the North Sea joined the union, which resulted in greater diplomatic esteem. Recognized by the various regional princes for the great economic potential, favorable charters for, often exclusive, commercial operations were granted. During its zenith the alliance maintained trading posts and &quot;kontors&quot; in virtually all cities between London and Edinburgh in the west to Novgorod in the east and Bergen in Norway. By the late 14th century the powerful league enforced its interests with military means, if necessary. This culminated in a war with the sovereign Kingdom of Denmark from 1361 to 1370. Principal city of the Hanseatic League remained Lübeck, where in 1356 the first general diet was held and its official structure was announced. The league declined after 1450 due to a number of factors, such as the 15th-century crisis, the territorial lords&#x27; shifting policies towards greater commercial control, the silver crisis and marginalization in the wider Eurasian trade network, among others.

===Eastward expansion===

The &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot; (lit. Eastern settlement) is the term for a process of largely uncoordinated immigration and chartering of settlement structures by ethnic Germans into territories, already inhabited by Slavs and Balts east of the Saale and Elbe rivers, such as modern Poland and Silesia and to the south into Bohemia, modern Hungary and Romania during the High Middle Ages from the 11th to the 14th century. The primary purpose of the early imperial military campaigns into the lands to the east during the 10th and 11th century, was to punish and subjugate the local heathen tribes. Conquered territories were mostly lost after the troops had retreated, but eventually were incorporated into the empire as marches, fortified borderlands with garrisoned troops in strongholds and castles, who were to ensure military control and enforce the exaction of tributes. Contemporary sources do not support the idea of policies or plans for the organized settlement of civilians.

Emperor Lothair II re-established feudal sovereignty over Poland, Denmark and Bohemia from 1135 and appointed margraves to turn the borderlands into hereditary fiefs and install a civilian administration. There is no discernible chronology of the immigration process as it took place in many individual efforts and stages, often even encouraged by the Slavic regional lords. However, the new communities were subjected to German law and customs. Total numbers of settlers were generally rather low and, depending on who held a numerical majority, populations usually assimilated into each other. In many regions only enclaves would persist, like Hermannstadt, founded by the Transylvanian Saxons in the medieval Hungarian Kingdom (today in Romania) who were called on by Geza II to repopulate the area as part of the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;, having arrived there and founding the city in 1147 [Saxons called these parts of Transylvania &quot;Altland&quot; to distinguish them from later immigrant Saxon settlements established in about 1220 by the Teutonic Order].
In 1230, the Catholic monastic order of the Teutonic Knights launched the Prussian Crusade. The campaign, that was supported by the forces of Polish duke Konrad I of Masovia, initially intended to Christianize the Baltic Old Prussians, succeeded primarily in the conquest of large territories. The order, emboldened by imperial approval, quickly resolved to establish an independent state, without the consent of duke Konrad. Recognizing only papal authority and based on a solid economy, the order steadily expanded the Teutonic state during the following 150 years, engaging in several land disputes with its neighbors. Permanent conflicts with the Kingdom of Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Novgorod Republic, eventually led to military defeat and containment by the mid-15th century. The last Grand Master Albert of Brandenburg converted to Lutheranism in 1525 and turned the remaining lands of the order into the secular Duchy of Prussia.

===Church and state===
Henry V, great-grandson of Conrad II, who had overthrown his father Henry IV became Holy Roman Emperor in 1111. Hoping to gain greater control over the church inside the Empire, Henry V appointed Adalbert of Saarbrücken as the powerful archbishop of Mainz in the same year. Adalbert began to assert the powers of the Church against secular authorities, that is, the Emperor. This precipitated the &quot;Crisis of 1111&quot; as yet another chapter of the long-term Investiture Controversy. In 1137, the prince-electors turned back to the Hohenstaufen family for a candidate, Conrad III. Conrad tried to divest his rival Henry the Proud of his two duchies—Bavaria and Saxony—that led to war in southern Germany as the empire was divided into two powerful factions. The faction of the &quot;Welfs&quot; or &quot;Guelphs&quot; (in Italian) supported the House of Welf of Henry the Proud, which was the ruling dynasty in the Duchy of Bavaria. The rival faction of the &quot;Waiblings&quot; or &quot;Ghibellines&quot; (in Italian) pledged allegiance to the Swabian House of Hohenstaufen. During this early period, the Welfs generally maintained ecclesiastical independence under the papacy and political particularism (the focus on ducal interests against the central imperial authority). The Waiblings, on the other hand, championed strict control of the church and a strong central imperial government.

During the reign of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa), an accommodation was reached in 1156 between the two factions. The Duchy of Bavaria was returned to Henry the Proud&#x27;s son Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony, who represented the Guelph party. However, the Margraviate of Austria was separated from Bavaria and turned into the independent Duchy of Austria by virtue of the Privilegium Minus in 1156.

Having become wealthy through trade, the confident cities of Northern Italy, supported by the Pope, increasingly opposed Barbarossa&#x27;s claim of feudal rule &quot;(Honor Imperii)&quot; over Italy. The cities united in the Lombard League and finally defeated Barbarossa in the Battle of Legnano in 1176. The following year a reconciliation was reached between the emperor and Pope Alexander III in the Treaty of Venice. The 1183 Peace of Constance eventually settled that the Italian cities remained loyal to the empire but were granted local jurisdiction and full regal rights in their territories.

In 1180, Henry the Lion was outlawed, Saxony was divided, and Bavaria was given to Otto of Wittelsbach, who founded the Wittelsbach dynasty, which was to rule Bavaria until 1918.

From 1184 to 1186, the empire under Frederick I Barbarossa reached its cultural peak with the &quot;Diet of Pentecost&quot; held at Mainz and the marriage of his son Henry in Milan to the Norman princess Constance of Sicily. The power of the feudal lords was undermined by the appointment of ministerials (unfree servants of the Emperor) as officials. Chivalry and the court life flowered, as expressed in the scholastic philosophy of Albertus Magnus and the literature of Wolfram von Eschenbach.

Between 1212 and 1250, Frederick II established a modern, professionally administered state from his base in Sicily. He resumed the conquest of Italy, leading to further conflict with the Papacy. In the Empire, extensive sovereign powers were granted to ecclesiastical and secular princes, leading to the rise of independent territorial states. The struggle with the Pope sapped the Empire&#x27;s strength, as Frederick II was excommunicated three times. After his death, the Hohenstaufen dynasty fell, followed by an interregnum during which there was no Emperor (1250–1273). This interregnum came to an end with the election of a small Swabian count, Rudolf of Habsburg, as emperor.

The failure of negotiations between Emperor Louis IV and the papacy led to the 1338 Declaration at Rhense by six princes of the Imperial Estate to the effect that election by all or the majority of the electors automatically conferred the royal title and rule over the empire, without papal confirmation. As result, the monarch was no longer subject to papal approbation and became increasingly dependent on the favour of the electors. Between 1346 and 1378 Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg, king of Bohemia, sought to restore imperial authority. The 1356 decree of the Golden Bull stipulated that all future emperors were to be chosen by a college of only seven – four secular and three clerical – electors. The secular electors were the King of Bohemia, the Count Palatine of the Rhine, the Duke of Saxony, and the Margrave of Brandenburg, the clerical electors were the Archbishops of Mainz, Trier, and Cologne.

Between 1347 and 1351 Germany and almost the entire European continent were consumed by the most severe outbreak of the Black Death pandemic. Estimated to have caused the abrupt death of 30 to 60% of Europe&#x27;s population, it led to widespread social and economic disruption and deep religious disaffection and fanaticism. Minority groups, and Jews in particular were blamed, singled out and attacked. As a consequence, many Jews fled and resettled in Eastern Europe.

===Towns and cities===
Total population estimates of the German territories range around 5 to 6 million by the end of Henry III&#x27;s reign in 1056 and about 7 to 8 million after Friedrich Barbarossa&#x27;s rule in 1190. The vast majority were farmers, typically in a state of serfdom under feudal lords and monasteries. Towns gradually emerged and in the 12th century many new cities were founded along the trading routes and near imperial strongholds and castles. The towns were subjected to the municipal legal system. Cities such as Cologne, that had acquired the status of Imperial Free Cities, were no longer answerable to the local landlords or bishops, but immediate subjects of the Emperor and enjoyed greater commercial and legal liberties. The towns were ruled by a council of the – usually mercantile – elite, the patricians. Craftsmen formed guilds, governed by strict rules, which sought to obtain control of the towns; a few were open to women. Society had diversified, but was divided into sharply demarcated classes of the clergy, physicians, merchants, various guilds of artisans, unskilled day labourers and peasants. Full citizenship was not available to paupers. Political tensions arose from issues of taxation, public spending, regulation of business, and market supervision, as well as the limits of corporate autonomy.

Cologne&#x27;s central location on the Rhine river placed it at the intersection of the major trade routes between east and west and was the basis of Cologne&#x27;s growth. The economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were characterized by the city&#x27;s status as a major harbor and transport hub upon the Rhine. It was the seat of an archbishop, under whose patronage the vast Cologne Cathedral was built since 1240. The cathedral houses sacred Christian relics and it has since become a well known pilgrimage destination. By 1288 the city had secured its independence from the archbishop (who relocated to Bonn), and was ruled by its burghers.

===Learning and culture===

Benedictine abbess Hildegard von Bingen wrote several influential theological, botanical, and medicinal texts, as well as letters, liturgical songs, poems, and arguably the oldest surviving morality play, &quot;Ordo Virtutum&quot;, while supervising brilliant miniature Illuminations. About 100 years later, Walther von der Vogelweide became the most celebrated of the Minnesänger, who were Middle High German lyric poets.

Around 1439, Johannes Gutenberg of Mainz, used movable type printing and issued the Gutenberg Bible. He was the global inventor of the printing press, thereby starting the Printing Revolution. Cheap printed books and pamphlets played central roles for the spread of the Reformation and the Scientific Revolution.

Around the transition from the 15th to the 16th century, Albrecht Dürer from Nuremberg established his reputation across Europe as painter, printmaker, mathematician, engraver, and theorist when he was still in his twenties and secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance.

==Early modern Germany==

===Social changes===
The early-modern European society gradually developed after the disasters of the 14th century as religious obedience and political loyalties declined in the wake of the Great Plague, the schism of the Church and prolonged dynastic wars. The rise of the cities and the emergence of the new burgher class eroded the societal, legal and economic order of feudalism.
The commercial enterprises of the mercantile elites in the quickly developing cities in South Germany (such as Augsburg and Nuremberg), with the most prominent families being the Gossembrots, Fuggers (the wealthiest family in Europe during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries), Welsers, Hochstetters, Imholts, generated unprecedented financial means. As financiers to both the leading ecclesiastical and secular rulers, these families fundamentally influenced the political affairs in the empire during the fifteenth and sixteenth century. The increasingly money based economy also provoked social discontent among knights and peasants and predatory &quot;robber knights&quot; became common.

From 1438 the Habsburg dynasty, who had acquired control in the south-eastern empire over the Duchy of Austria, Bohemia and Hungary after the death of King Louis II in 1526, managed to permanently occupy the position of the Holy Roman Emperor until 1806 (with the exception of the years between 1742 and 1745).

Some Europe-wide revolutions were born in the Empire: the combination of the first modern postal system established by Maximilian (with the management under the Taxis family) with the printing system invented by Gutenberg produced a communication revolution – the Empire&#x27;s decentralized nature made censorship difficult and this combined with the new communication system to facilitate free expression, thus elevating cultural life. The system also helped the authorities to disseminate orders and policies, boosted the Empire&#x27;s coherence in general, and helped reformers like Luther to broadcast their views and communicate with each other effectively, thus contributing to the religious Reformation.

Maximilian&#x27;s military reforms, especially his development of the Landsknechte, caused a military revolution that broke the back of the knight class and spread all over Europe shortly after his death.

===Imperial reform===

During his reign from 1493 to 1519, Maximilian I, in a combined effort with the Estates (who sometimes acted as opponents and sometimes as cooperators to him), his officials and his humanists, reformed the empire. A dual system of Supreme Courts (the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot; and the &quot;Reichshofrat&quot;) was established (with the &quot;Reichshofrat&quot; playing a more efficient role during the Early Modern period), together with the formalized Reception of Roman Law; the Imperial Diet (&quot;Reichstag&quot;) became the all-important political forum and the supreme legal and constitutional institution, which would act as a guarantee for the preservation of the Empire in the long run; a Permanent Land Piece (&quot;Ewiger Landfriede&quot;) was declared in 1495 with regional leagues and unions providing the supporting structure, together with the creation of the &quot;Reichskreise&quot; (&quot;Imperial Circles&quot;, which would serve the purpose of organize imperial armies, collect taxes and enforce orders of the imperial institutions); the Imperial and Court Chanceries were combined to become the decisive government institution; the Landsknechte that Maximilian created became a form of imperial army; a national political culture began to emerge; and the German language began to attain an unified form. The political structure remained incomplete and piecemeal though, mainly due to the failure of the Common Penny (an imperial tax) that the Estates resisted. Through many compromises between emperor and estates though, a flexible, future-oriented problem-solving mechanism for the Empire was formed, together with a monarchy through which the emperor shared power with the Estates. Whether the Reform also equated to a (successful or unsuccessful) nation building process remains a debate.

The addition &quot;Nationis Germanicæ&quot; (of German Nation) to the emperor&#x27;s title appeared first in the 15th century: in a 1486 law decreed by Frederick III and in 1512 in reference to the Imperial Diet in Cologne by Maximilian I. In 1525, the Heilbronn reform plan – the most advanced document of the German Peasants&#x27; War (&quot;Deutscher Bauernkrieg&quot;) – referred to the &quot;Reich&quot; as &quot;von Teutscher Nation&quot; (of German nation). During the fifteen century, the term &quot;German nation&quot; had witness a rise in use due to the growth of a &quot;community of interests&quot;. The Estates also increasingly distinguished between their German Reich and the wider, &quot;universal&quot; Reich.

===Protestant Reformation===
In order to manage their ever growing expenses, the Renaissance Popes of the 15th and early 16th century promoted the excessive sale of indulgences and offices and titles of the Roman Curia.

In 1517, the monk Martin Luther published a pamphlet with 95 Theses that he posted in the town square of Wittenberg and handed copies of to feudal lords. Whether he nailed them to a church door at Wittenberg remains unclear. The list detailed 95 assertions, he argued, represented corrupt practice of the Christian faith and misconduct within the Catholic Church. Although perhaps not Luther&#x27;s chief concern, he received popular support for his condemnation of the sale of indulgences and clerical offices, the pope&#x27;s and higher clergy&#x27;s abuse of power and his doubts of the very idea of the institution of the Church and the papacy.
The Protestant Reformation was the first successful challenge to the Catholic Church and began in 1521 as Luther was outlawed at the Diet of Worms after his refusal to repent. The ideas of the reformation spread rapidly, as the new technology of the modern printing press ensured cheap mass copies and distribution of the theses and helped by the Emperor Charles V&#x27;s wars with France and the Turks. Hiding in the Wartburg Castle, Luther translated the Bible into German, thereby greatly contributing to the establishment of the modern German language. This is highlighted by the fact that Luther spoke only a local dialect of minor importance during that time. After the publication of his Bible, his dialect suppressed others and constitutes to a great extent what is now modern German. With the protestation of the Lutheran princes at the Imperial Diet of Speyer in 1529 and the acceptance and adoption of the Lutheran Augsburg Confession by the Lutheran princes beginning in 1530, the separate Lutheran church was established.

The German Peasants&#x27; War, which began in the southwest in Alsace and Swabia and spread further east into Franconia, Thuringia and Austria, was a series of economic and religious revolts of the rural lower classes, encouraged by the rhetoric of various radical religious reformers and Anabaptists against the ruling feudal lords. Although occasionally assisted by war-experienced noblemen like Götz von Berlichingen and Florian Geyer (in Franconia) and the theologian Thomas Müntzer (in Thuringia), the peasant forces lacked military structure, skill, logistics and equipment and as many as 100,000 insurgents were eventually defeated and massacred by the territorial princes.

The Catholic Counter-Reformation, initiated in 1545 at the Council of Trent was spearheaded by the scholarly religious Jesuit order, that was founded just five years prior by several clerics around Ignatius of Loyola. Its intent was to challenge and contain the Protestant Reformation via apologetic and polemical writings and decrees, ecclesiastical reconfiguration, wars and imperial political maneuverings. In 1547, emperor Charles V defeated the Schmalkaldic League, a military alliance of Protestant rulers. The 1555 Peace of Augsburg decreed the recognition of the Lutheran Faith and religious division of the empire. It also stipulated the ruler&#x27;s right to determine the official confession in his principality (&quot;Cuius regio, eius religio&quot;). The Counter-Reformation eventually failed to reintegrate the central and northern German Lutheran states. In 1608/1609 the Protestant Union and the Catholic League were formed.

=== Thirty Years&#x27; War, 1618–1648 ===

The 1618 to 1648 Thirty Years&#x27; War, that took place almost exclusively in the Holy Roman Empire has its origins, which remain widely debated, in the unsolved and recurring conflicts of the Catholic and Protestant factions. The Catholic emperor Ferdinand II attempted to achieve the religious and political unity of the empire, while the opposing Protestant Union forces were determined to defend their religious rights. The religious motive served as the universal justification for the various territorial and foreign princes, who over the course of several stages joined either of the two warring parties in order to gain land and power.

The conflict was sparked by the revolt of the Protestant nobility of Bohemia against emperor Matthias&#x27; succession policies. After imperial triumph at the Battle of White Mountain and a short-lived peace, the war grew to become a political European conflict by the intervention of King Christian IV of Denmark from 1625 to 1630, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden from 1630 to 1648 and France under Cardinal Richelieu from 1635 to 1648. The conflict increasingly evolved into a struggle between the French House of Bourbon and the House of Habsburg for predominance in Europe, for which the central German territories of the empire served as the battleground.

The war ranks among the most catastrophic in history as three decades of constant warfare and destruction had left the land devastated. Marauding armies incessantly pillaged the countryside, seized and levied heavy taxes on cities and indiscriminately plundered the food stocks of the peasantry. There were also the countless bands of murderous outlaws, sick, homeless, disrupted people and invalid soldiery. Overall social and economic disruption caused a dramatic decline in population as a result of pandemic murder and random rape and killings, endemic infectious diseases, crop failures, famine, declining birth rates, wanton burglary, witch-hunts and the emigration of terrified people. Estimates vary between a 38% drop from 16 million people in 1618 to 10 million by 1650 and a mere 20% drop from 20 million to 16 million. The Altmark and Württemberg regions were especially hard hit, where it took generations to fully recover.

The war was the last major religious struggle in mainland Europe and ended in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia. It resulted in increased autonomy for the constituent states of the Holy Roman Empire, limiting the power of the emperor. Most of Alsace was ceded to France, Western Pomerania and Bremen-Verden were given to Sweden as Imperial fiefs, and the Netherlands officially left the Empire.

===Culture and literacy===
The population of Germany reached about twenty million people by the mid-16th century, the great majority of whom were peasant farmers.

The Protestant Reformation was a triumph for literacy and the new printing press. Luther&#x27;s translation of the Bible into High German (the New Testament was published in 1522; the Old Testament was published in parts and completed in 1534) was a decisive impulse for the increase of literacy in early modern Germany, and stimulated printing and distribution of religious books and pamphlets. From 1517 onward religious pamphlets flooded Germany and much of Europe. The Reformation instigated a media revolution as by 1530 over 10,000 individual works are published with a total of ten million copies. Luther strengthened his attacks on Rome by depicting a &quot;good&quot; against &quot;bad&quot; church. It soon became clear that print could be used for propaganda in the Reformation for particular agendas. Reform writers used pre-Reformation styles, clichés, and stereotypes and changed items as needed for their own purposes. Especially effective were Luther&#x27;s &quot;Small Catechism&quot;, for use of parents teaching their children, and &quot;Larger Catechism,&quot; for pastors. Using the German vernacular they expressed the Apostles&#x27; Creed in simpler, more personal, Trinitarian language. Illustrations in the newly translated Bible and in many tracts popularized Luther&#x27;s ideas. Lucas Cranach the Elder, the painter patronized by the electors of Wittenberg, was a close friend of Luther, and illustrated Luther&#x27;s theology for a popular audience. He dramatized Luther&#x27;s views on the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, while remaining mindful of Luther&#x27;s careful distinctions about proper and improper uses of visual imagery.

Luther&#x27;s translation of the Bible into High German was also decisive for the German language and its evolution from Early New High German to Modern Standard German. The publication of Luther&#x27;s Bible was a decisive moment in the spread of literacy in early modern Germany, and promoted the development of non-local forms of language and exposed all speakers to forms of German from outside their own area.

===Science===

Notable late fifteenth to early eighteenth-century polymaths include: Johannes Trithemius, one of the founder of modern cryptography, founder of steganography, as well as bibliography and literary studies as branches of knowledge; Conrad Celtes, the first and foremost German cartographic writer and &quot;the greatest lyric genius and certainly the greatest organizer and popularizer of German Humanism&quot;; Athanasius Kircher, described by Fletcher as &quot;a founder figure of various disciplines—of geology (certainly vulcanology), musicology (as a surveyor of musical forms), museum curatorship, Coptology, to name a few—and might be claimed today as the first theorist of gravity and a long-term originator of the moving pictures (with his magic lantern shows). Through his many enthusiasms, moreover, he was the conduit of others&#x27; pursuits in the rapidly widening horizon of knowledge that marks the later Renaissance.&quot;; and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, one of the greatest, if not the greatest &quot;Universal genius&quot;, of all times.

Cartography developed strongly, with the center being Nuremberg, at the beginning of the sixteenth century. Martin Waldseemüller and Matthias Ringmann&#x27;s &quot;Universalis Cosmographia&quot; and the 1513 edition of &quot;Geography&quot; marked the climax of a cartography revolution. The emperor himself dabbled in cartography.

In 1515, Johannes Stabius (court astronomer under Maximilian I), Albrecht Dürer and the astronomer Konrad Heinfogel produced the first planispheres of both southern and northerns hemispheres, also the first printed celestial maps. These maps prompted the revival of interest in the field of uranometry throughout Europe.

Astronomer Johannes Kepler from Weil der Stadt was one of the pioneering minds of empirical and rational research. Through rigorous application of the principles of the Scientific method he construed his laws of planetary motion. His ideas influenced contemporary Italian scientist Galileo Galilei and provided fundamental mechanical principles for Isaac Newton&#x27;s theory of universal gravitation.

===Colonies===
German Colonies in the Americas existed because the Free Imperial Cities of Augsburg and Nuremberg got colonial rights in the Province of Venezuela or North of South America in return for debts owed by the Holy Roman Empire Charles V, who was also King of Spain. In 1528, Charles V issued a charter by which the Welser family possessed the rights to explore, rule and colonize the area, also with the motivation of searching for the legendary golden city of El Dorado. Their principal colony was Klein-Venedig. A never realized colonial project was Hanauish-Indies intended by Friedrich Casimir, Count of Hanau-Lichtenberg as a fief of the Dutch West India Company. The project failed due to a lack of funds and the outbreak of the Franco-Dutch War in 1672.

==1648–1815==
===Rise of Prussia===

Frederick William, ruler of Brandenburg-Prussia since 1640 and later called the Great Elector, acquired East Pomerania via the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. He reorganized his loose and scattered territories and managed to throw off the vassalage of Prussia under the Kingdom of Poland during the Second Northern War. In order to address the demographic problem of Prussia&#x27;s largely rural population of about three million, he attracted the immigration and settlement of French Huguenots in urban areas. Many became craftsmen and entrepreneurs. King Frederick William I, known as the &quot;Soldier King&quot;, who reigned from 1713 to 1740, established the structures for the highly centralized Prussian state and raised a professional army, that was to play a central role. He also successfully operated a command economy that some historians consider mercantilist.

The total population of Germany (in its 1914 territorial extent) grew from 16 million in 1700 to 17 million in 1750 and reached 24 million in 1800. The 18th-century economy noticeably profited from widespread practical application of the Scientific method as greater yields and a more reliable agricultural production and the introduction of hygienic standards positively affected the birth rate – death rate balance.

===Wars===
Louis XIV of France waged a series of successful wars in order to extend the French territory. He occupied Lorraine (1670) and annexed the remainder of Alsace (1678–1681) that included the free imperial city of Straßburg. At the start of the Nine Years&#x27; War, he also invaded the Electorate of the Palatinate (1688–1697). Louis established a number of courts whose sole function was to reinterpret historic decrees and treaties, the Treaties of Nijmegen (1678) and the Peace of Westphalia (1648) in particular in favor of his policies of conquest. He considered the conclusions of these courts, the &quot;Chambres de réunion&quot; as sufficient justification for his boundless annexations. Louis&#x27; forces operated inside the Holy Roman Empire largely unopposed, because all available imperial contingents fought in Austria in the Great Turkish War. The Grand Alliance of 1689 took up arms against France and countered any further military advances of Louis. The conflict ended in 1697 as both parties agreed to peace talks after either side had realized, that a total victory was financially unattainable. The Treaty of Ryswick provided for the return of the Lorraine and Luxembourg to the empire and the abandoning of French claims to the Palatinate.

After the last-minute relief of Vienna from a siege and the imminent seizure by a Turkish force in 1683, the combined troops of the Holy League, that had been founded the following year, embarked on the military containment of the Ottoman Empire and reconquered Hungary in 1687. The Papal States, the Holy Roman Empire, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Republic of Venice and since 1686 Russia had joined the league under the leadership of Pope Innocent XI. Prince Eugene of Savoy, who served under emperor Leopold I, took supreme command in 1697 and decisively defeated the Ottomans in a series of spectacular battles and
manoeuvres. The 1699 Treaty of Karlowitz marked the end of the Great Turkish War and Prince Eugene continued his service for the Habsburg monarchy as president of the War Council. He effectively ended Turkish rule over most of the territorial states in the Balkans during the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–1718. The Treaty of Passarowitz left Austria to freely establish royal domains in Serbia and the Banat and maintain hegemony in Southeast Europe, on which the future Austrian Empire was based.

===Enlightened absolutism===
Frederick II &quot;the Great&quot; is best known for his military genius and unique utilisation of the highly organized army to make Prussia one of the great powers in Europe as well as escaping from almost certain national disaster at the last minute. He was also an artist, author and philosopher, who conceived and promoted the concept of enlightened absolutism.

Austrian empress Maria Theresa succeeded in bringing about a favorable conclusion for her in the 1740 to 1748 war for recognition of her succession to the throne. However, Silesia was permanently lost to Prussia as a consequence of the Silesian Wars and the Seven Years&#x27; War. The 1763 Treaty of Hubertusburg ruled that Austria and Saxony had to relinquish all claims to Silesia. Prussia, that had nearly doubled its territory was eventually recognized as a great European power with the consequence that the politics of the following century were fundamentally influenced by German dualism, the rivalry of Austria and Prussia for supremacy in Central Europe.

The concept of enlightened absolutism, although rejected by the nobility and citizenry, was advocated in Prussia and Austria and implemented since 1763. Prussian king Frederick II defended the idea in an essay and argued that the benevolent monarch simply is the &quot;first servant of the state&quot;, who effects his absolute political power for the benefit of the population as a whole. A number of legal reforms (e.g. the abolition of torture and the emancipation of the rural population and the Jews), the reorganization of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, the introduction of compulsory education for boys and girls and promotion of religious tolerance, among others, caused rapid social and economic development.

During 1772 to 1795 Prussia instigated the partitions of Poland by occupying the western territories of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Austria and Russia resolved to acquire the remaining lands with the effect that Poland ceased to exist as a sovereign state until 1918.

===Smaller states===
The smaller German states were overshadowed by Prussia and Austria. Bavaria had a rural economy. Saxony was in economically good shape, although numerous wars had taken their toll. During the time when Prussia rose rapidly within Germany, Saxony was distracted by foreign affairs. The House of Wettin concentrated on acquiring and then holding on to the Polish throne which was ultimately unsuccessful.

Many of the smaller states of Germany were run by bishops, who in reality were from powerful noble families and showed scant interest in religion. While none of the later ecclesial rulers reached the outstanding reputation of Mainz&#x27; Johann Philipp von Schönborn or Münster&#x27;s Christoph Bernhard von Galen, some of them promoted Enlightenment like the benevolent and progressive Franz Ludwig von Erthal in Würzburg and Bamberg.

In Hesse-Kassel, the Landgrave Frederick II, ruled from 1760 to 1785 as an enlightened despot, and raised money by renting soldiers (called &quot;Hessians&quot;) to Great Britain to help fight the American Revolutionary War. He combined Enlightenment ideas with Christian values, cameralist plans for central control of the economy, and a militaristic approach toward diplomacy.

Hanover did not have to support a lavish court—its rulers were also kings of England and resided in London. George III, elector (ruler) from 1760 to 1820, never once visited Hanover. The local nobility who ran the country opened the University of Göttingen in 1737; it soon became a world-class intellectual center. Baden sported perhaps the best government of the smaller states. Karl Friedrich ruled for 73 years and was an enthusiast for the Enlightenment; he abolished serfdom in 1783.

The smaller states failed to form coalitions with each other, and were eventually overwhelmed by Prussia who swallowed up many of them between 1807 and 1871.

===Social changes===

Prussia underwent major social change between the mid-17th and mid-18th centuries as the nobility declined as the traditional aristocracy struggled to compete with the rising merchant class, which developed into a new Bourgeoisie middle class, while the emancipation of the serfs granted the rural peasantry land purchasing rights and freedom of movement, and a series of agrarian reforms in northwestern Germany abolished feudal obligations and divided up feudal land, giving rise to wealthier peasants and paved the way for a more efficient rural economy.

===Enlightenment===

During the mid-18th century, the recognition and application of Enlightenment cultural, intellectual and spiritual ideals and standards, led to a flourishing of art, music, philosophy, science and literature. The philosopher Christian Wolff was a pioneering author in a vast number of fields of Enlightenment rationality, and established German as the prevailing language of philosophical reasoning, scholarly instruction and research.

In 1685, Margrave Frederick William of Prussia issued the Edict of Potsdam within a week after French king Louis XIV&#x27;s Edict of Fontainebleau, that decreed the abolishment of the 1598 concession to free religious practice for Protestants. Frederick William offered his &quot;co-religionists, who are oppressed and assailed for the sake of the Holy Gospel and its pure doctrine...a secure and free refuge in all Our Lands&quot;. Around 20,000 Huguenot refugees arrived in an immediate wave and settled in the cities, 40% in Berlin, the ducal residence alone. The French Lyceum in Berlin was established in 1689 and the French language had by the end of the 17th century replaced Latin to be spoken universally in international diplomacy. The nobility and the educated middle-class of Prussia and the various German states increasingly used the French language in public conversation in combination with universal cultivated manners. Like no other German state, Prussia had access to and the skill set for the application of pan-European Enlightenment ideas to develop more rational political and administrative institutions. The princes of Saxony carried out a comprehensive series of fundamental fiscal, administrative, judicial, educational, cultural and general economic reforms. The reforms were aided by the country&#x27;s strong urban structure and influential commercial groups, who modernized pre-1789 Saxony along the lines of classic Enlightenment principles.

Johann Gottfried von Herder broke new ground in philosophy and poetry, as a leader of the Sturm und Drang movement of proto-Romanticism. Weimar Classicism (&quot;Weimarer Klassik&quot;) was a cultural and literary movement based in Weimar that sought to establish a new humanism by synthesizing Romantic, classical, and Enlightenment ideas. The movement, from 1772 until 1805, involved Herder as well as polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller, a poet and historian. Herder argued that every folk had its own particular identity, which was expressed in its language and culture. This legitimized the promotion of German language and culture and helped shape the development of German nationalism. Schiller&#x27;s plays expressed the restless spirit of his generation, depicting the hero&#x27;s struggle against social pressures and the force of destiny.

German music, sponsored by the upper classes, came of age under composers Johann Sebastian Bach, Joseph Haydn, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

Königsberg philosopher Immanuel Kant tried to reconcile rationalism and religious belief, individual freedom, and political authority. Kant&#x27;s work contained basic tensions that would continue to shape German thought – and indeed all of European philosophy – well into the 20th century. The ideas of the Enlightenment and their implementation received general approval and recognition as principal cause for widespread cultural progress.

===French Revolution, 1789–1815===

German reaction to the French Revolution was mixed at first. German intellectuals celebrated the outbreak, hoping to see the triumph of Reason and The Enlightenment. The royal courts in Vienna and Berlin denounced the overthrow of the king and the threatened spread of notions of liberty, equality, and fraternity. By 1793, the execution of the French king and the onset of the Terror disillusioned the Bildungsbürgertum (educated middle classes). Reformers said the solution was to have faith in the ability of Germans to reform their laws and institutions in peaceful fashion.

Europe was racked by two decades of war revolving around France&#x27;s efforts to spread its revolutionary ideals, and the opposition of reactionary royalty. War broke out in 1792 as Austria and Prussia invaded France, but were defeated at the Battle of Valmy (1792). The German lands saw armies marching back and forth, bringing devastation (albeit on a far lower scale than the Thirty Years&#x27; War, almost two centuries before), but also bringing new ideas of liberty and civil rights for the people. Prussia and Austria ended their failed wars with France but (with Russia) partitioned Poland among themselves in 1793 and 1795.

====French consulate suzerainty====
France took control of the Rhineland, imposed French-style reforms, abolished feudalism, established constitutions, promoted freedom of religion, emancipated Jews, opened the bureaucracy to ordinary citizens of talent, and forced the nobility to share power with the rising middle class. Napoleon created the Kingdom of Westphalia as a model state. These reforms proved largely permanent and modernized the western parts of Germany. When the French tried to impose the French language, German opposition grew in intensity. A Second Coalition of Britain, Russia, and Austria then attacked France but failed. Napoleon established direct or indirect control over most of western Europe, including the German states apart from Prussia and Austria. The old Holy Roman Empire was little more than a farce; Napoleon simply abolished it in 1806 while forming new countries under his control. In Germany Napoleon set up the &quot;Confederation of the Rhine&quot;, comprising most of the German states except Prussia and Austria.

====Imperial French suzerainty====
Under Frederick William II&#x27;s weak rule (1786–1797) Prussia had undergone a serious economic, political and military decline. His successor king Frederick William III tried to remain neutral during the War of the Third Coalition and French emperor Napoleon&#x27;s dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire and reorganisation of the German principalities. Induced by the queen and a pro-war party Frederick William joined the Fourth Coalition in October 1806. Napoleon easily defeated the Prussian army at the Battle of Jena and occupied Berlin. Prussia lost its recently acquired territories in western Germany, its army was reduced to 42,000 men, no trade with Britain was allowed and Berlin had to pay Paris high reparations and fund the French army of occupation. Saxony changed sides to support Napoleon and joined the Confederation of the Rhine. Ruler Frederick Augustus I was rewarded with the title of king and given a part of Poland taken from Prussia, which became known as the Duchy of Warsaw.

After Napoleon&#x27;s military fiasco in Russia in 1812, Prussia allied with Russia in the Sixth Coalition. A series of battles followed and Austria joined the alliance. Napoleon was decisively defeated in the Battle of Leipzig in late 1813. The German states of the Confederation of the Rhine defected to the Coalition against Napoleon, who rejected any peace terms. Coalition forces invaded France in early 1814, Paris fell and in April Napoleon surrendered. Prussia as one of the winners at the Congress of Vienna, gained extensive territory.

==1815–1871==

===Overview===

In 1815, continental Europe was in a state of overall turbulence and exhaustion, as a consequence of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. The liberal spirit of the Enlightenment and Revolutionary era diverged toward Romanticism. The victorious members of the Coalition had negotiated a new peaceful balance of powers in Vienna and agreed to maintain a stable German heartland that keeps French imperialism at bay. However, the idea of reforming the defunct Holy Roman Empire was discarded. Napoleon&#x27;s reorganization of the German states was continued and the remaining princes were allowed to keep their titles. In 1813, in return for guarantees from the Allies that the sovereignty and integrity of the Southern German states (Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria) would be preserved, they broke with France.

===German Confederation===
During the 1815 Congress of Vienna the 39 former states of the &quot;Confederation of the Rhine&quot; joined the German Confederation, a loose agreement for mutual defense. Attempts of economic integration and customs coordination were frustrated by repressive anti-national policies. Great Britain approved of the union, convinced that a stable, peaceful entity in central Europe could discourage aggressive moves by France or Russia. Most historians, however, concluded, that the Confederation was weak and ineffective and an obstacle to German nationalism. The union was undermined by the creation of the Zollverein in 1834, the 1848 revolutions, the rivalry between Prussia and Austria and was finally dissolved in the wake of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, to be replaced by the North German Confederation during the same year.

===Society and economy===
Increasingly after 1815, a centralized Prussian government based in Berlin took over the powers of the nobles, which in terms of control over the peasantry had been almost absolute. To help the nobility avoid indebtedness, Berlin set up a credit institution to provide capital loans in 1809, and extended the loan network to peasants in 1849. When the German Empire was established in 1871, the Junker nobility controlled the army and the navy, the bureaucracy, and the royal court; they generally set governmental policies.

====Population====

Between 1815 and 1865 the population of the German Confederation (excluding Austria) grew around 60% from 21 million to 34 million. Simultaneously the Demographic Transition took place as the high birth rates and high death rates of the pre-industrial country shifted to low birth and death rates of the fast-growing industrialized urban economic and agricultural system. Increased agricultural productivity secured a steady food supply, as famines and epidemics declined. This allowed people to marry earlier, and have more children. The high birthrate was offset by a very high rate of infant mortality and after 1840, large-scale emigration to the United States. Emigration totaled at 480,000 in the 1840s, 1,200,000 in the 1850s, and at 780,000 in the 1860s. The upper and middle classes first practiced birth control, soon to be universally adopted.

====Industrialization====

In 1800, Germany&#x27;s social structure was poorly suited to entrepreneurship or economic development. Domination by France during the French Revolution (1790s to 1815), however, produced important institutional reforms, that included the abolition of feudal restrictions on the sale of large landed estates, the reduction of the power of the guilds in the cities, and the introduction of a new, more efficient commercial law. The idea, that these reforms were beneficial for Industrialization has been contested.

In the early 19th century the Industrial Revolution was in full swing in Britain, France, and Belgium. The various small federal states in Germany developed only slowly and independently as competition was strong. Early investments for the railway network during the 1830s came almost exclusively from private hands. Without a central regulatory agency the construction projects were quickly realized. Actual industrialization only took off after 1850 in the wake of the railroad construction. The textile industry grew rapidly, profiting from the elimination of tariff barriers by the Zollverein. During the second half of the 19th century the German industry grew exponentially and by 1900, Germany was an industrial world leader along with Britain and the United States.

====Urbanization====
In 1800, the population was predominantly rural, as only 10% lived in communities of 5,000 or more people, and only 2% lived in cities of more than 100,000 people. After 1815, the urban population grew rapidly, due to the influx of young people from the rural areas. Berlin grew from 172,000 in 1800, to 826,000 inhabitants in 1870, Hamburg from 130,000 to 290,000, Munich from 40,000 to 269,000 and Dresden from 60,000 to 177,000.

====Railways====
The takeoff stage of economic development came with the railroad revolution in the 1840s, which opened up new markets for local products, created a pool of middle managers, increased the demand for engineers, architects and skilled machinists and stimulated investments in coal and iron. Political disunity of three dozen states and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. However, by the 1840s, trunk lines did link the major cities; each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. Economist Friedrich List summed up the advantages to be derived from the development of the railway system in 1841:
* 1. As a means of national defence, it facilitates the concentration, distribution and direction of the army.
* 2. It is a means to the improvement of the culture of the nation. It brings talent, knowledge and skill of every kind readily to market.
* 3. It secures the community against dearth and famine, and against excessive fluctuation in the prices of the necessaries of life.
* 4. It promotes the spirit of the nation, as it has a tendency to destroy the Philistine spirit arising from isolation and provincial prejudice and vanity. It binds nations by ligaments, and promotes an interchange of food and of commodities, thus making it feel to be a unit. The iron rails become a nerve system, which, on the one hand, strengthens public opinion, and, on the other hand, strengthens the power of the state for police and governmental purposes.

Lacking a technological base at first, engineering and hardware was imported from Britain. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was the support of industrialisation. Eventually numerous lines criss-crossed the Ruhr area and other industrial centers and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, 9,400 locomotives pulled 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight a day.

====Newspapers and magazines====

While there existed no national newspaper the many states issued a great variety of printed media, although they rarely exceeded regional significance. In a typical town existed one or two outlets, urban centers, such as Berlin and Leipzig had dozens. The audience was limited to a few per cent of male adults, chiefly from the aristocratic and upper middle class. Liberal publishers outnumbered conservative ones by a wide margin. Foreign governments bribed editors to guarantee a favorable image. Censorship was strict, and the imperial government issued the political news that was supposed to be published. After 1871, strict press laws were enforced by Bismarck to contain the Socialists and hostile editors. Editors focused on political commentary, culture, the arts, high culture and the popular serialized novels. Magazines were politically more influential and attracted intellectual authors.

====Science and culture during the 18th and 19th century====
19th-century artists and intellectuals were greatly inspired by the ideas of the French Revolution and the great poets and writers Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Friedrich Schiller. The Sturm und Drang romantic movement was embraced and emotion was given free expression in reaction to the perceived rationalism of the Enlightenment. Philosophical principles and methods were revolutionized by Immanuel Kant&#x27;s paradigm shift. Ludwig van Beethoven was the most influential composer of the period from classical to Romantic music. His use of tonal architecture in such a way as to allow significant expansion of musical forms and structures was immediately recognized as bringing a new dimension to music. His later piano music and string quartets, especially, showed the way to a completely unexplored musical universe, and influenced Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann. In opera, a new Romantic atmosphere combining supernatural terror and melodramatic plot in a folkloric context was first successfully achieved by Carl Maria von Weber and perfected by Richard Wagner in his Ring Cycle. The Brothers Grimm collected folk stories into the popular Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tales and are ranked among the founding fathers of German studies, who initiated the work on the Deutsches Wörterbuch (&quot;The German Dictionary&quot;), the most comprehensive work on the German language.

University professors developed international reputations, especially in the humanities led by history and philology, which brought a new historical perspective to the study of political history, theology, philosophy, language, and literature. With Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Max Weber, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in philosophy, Friedrich Schleiermacher in theology and Leopold von Ranke in history became famous. The University of Berlin, founded in 1810, became the world&#x27;s leading university. Von Ranke, for example, professionalized history and set the world standard for historiography. By the 1830s mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology had emerged with world class science, led by Alexander von Humboldt in natural science and Carl Friedrich Gauss in mathematics. Young intellectuals often turned to politics, but their support for the failed revolution of 1848 forced many into exile.

====Religion====
Two main developments reshaped religion in Germany. Across the land, there was a movement to unite the larger Lutheran and the smaller Reformed Protestant churches. The churches themselves brought this about in Baden, Nassau, and Bavaria. However, in Prussia King Frederick William III was determined to handle unification entirely on his own terms, without consultation. His goal was to unify the Protestant churches, and to impose a single standardized liturgy, organization and even architecture. The long-term goal was to have fully centralized royal control of all the Protestant churches. In a series of proclamations over several decades the &quot;Church of the Prussian Union&quot; was formed, bringing together the more numerous Lutherans, and the less numerous Reformed Protestants. The government of Prussia now had full control over church affairs, with the king himself recognized as the leading bishop. Opposition to unification came from the &quot;Old Lutherans&quot; in Silesia who clung tightly to the theological and liturgical forms they had followed since the days of Luther. The government attempted to crack down on them, so they went underground. Tens of thousands migrated, to South Australia, and especially to the United States, where they formed the Missouri Synod, which is still in operation as a conservative denomination. Finally in 1845 a new king Frederick William IV offered a general amnesty and allowed the Old Lutherans to form a separate church association with only nominal government control.

From the religious point of view of the typical Catholic or Protestant, major changes were underway in terms of a much more personalized religiosity that focused on the individual more than the church or the ceremony. The rationalism of the late 19th century faded away, and there was a new emphasis on the psychology and feeling of the individual, especially in terms of contemplating sinfulness, redemption, and the mysteries and the revelations of Christianity. Pietistic revivals were common among Protestants. Among, Catholics there was a sharp increase in popular pilgrimages. In 1844 alone, half a million pilgrims made a pilgrimage to the city of Trier in the Rhineland to view the Seamless robe of Jesus, said to be the robe that Jesus wore on the way to his crucifixion. Catholic bishops in Germany had historically been largely independent of Rome, but now the Vatican exerted increasing control, a new &quot;ultramontanism&quot; of Catholics highly loyal to Rome. A sharp controversy broke out in 1837–1838 in the largely Catholic Rhineland over the religious education of children of mixed marriages, where the mother was Catholic and the father Protestant. The government passed laws to require that these children always be raised as Protestants, contrary to Napoleonic law that had previously prevailed and allowed the parents to make the decision. It put the Catholic Archbishop under house arrest. In 1840, the new King Frederick William IV sought reconciliation and ended the controversy by agreeing to most of the Catholic demands. However Catholic memories remained deep and led to a sense that Catholics always needed to stick together in the face of an untrustworthy government.

===Politics of restoration and revolution===
====After Napoleon====

After the fall of Napoleon, Europe&#x27;s statesmen convened in Vienna in 1815 for the reorganisation of European affairs, under the leadership of the Austrian Prince Metternich. The political principles agreed upon at this Congress of Vienna included the restoration, legitimacy and solidarity of rulers for the repression of revolutionary and nationalist ideas.

The German Confederation () was founded, a loose union of 39 states (35 ruling princes and 4 free cities) under Austrian leadership, with a Federal Diet () meeting in Frankfurt am Main. It was a loose coalition that failed to satisfy most nationalists. The member states largely went their own way, and Austria had its own interests.

In 1819, a student radical assassinated the reactionary playwright August von Kotzebue, who had scoffed at liberal student organisations. In one of the few major actions of the German Confederation, Prince Metternich called a conference that issued the repressive Carlsbad Decrees, designed to suppress liberal agitation against the conservative governments of the German states. The Decrees terminated the fast-fading nationalist fraternities (), removed liberal university professors, and expanded the censorship of the press. The decrees began the &quot;persecution of the demagogues&quot;, which was directed against individuals who were accused of spreading revolutionary and nationalist ideas. Among the persecuted were the poet Ernst Moritz Arndt, the publisher Johann Joseph Görres and the &quot;Father of Gymnastics&quot; Ludwig Jahn.

In 1834, the Zollverein was established, a customs union between Prussia and most other German states, but excluding Austria. As industrialisation developed, the need for a unified German state with a uniform currency, legal system, and government became more and more obvious.

====1848====

Growing discontent with the political and social order imposed by the Congress of Vienna led to the outbreak, in 1848, of the March Revolution in the German states. In May the German National Assembly (the Frankfurt Parliament) met in Frankfurt to draw up a national German constitution.

But the 1848 revolution turned out to be unsuccessful: King Frederick William IV of Prussia refused the imperial crown, the Frankfurt parliament was dissolved, the ruling princes repressed the risings by military force, and the German Confederation was re-established by 1850. Many leaders went into exile, including a number who went to the United States and became a political force there.

====1850s====
The 1850s were a period of extreme political reaction. Dissent was vigorously suppressed, and many Germans emigrated to America following the collapse of the 1848 uprisings. Frederick William IV became extremely depressed and melancholic during this period, and was surrounded by men who advocated clericalism and absolute divine monarchy. The Prussian people once again lost interest in politics. Prussia not only expanded its territory but began to industrialize rapidly, while maintaining a strong agricultural base.

====Bismarck takes charge (1862–1866)====
In 1857, the Prussian king Frederick William IV suffered a stroke and his brother William served as regent until 1861 when he became King William I. Although conservative, William was very pragmatic. His most significant accomplishment was the naming of Otto von Bismarck as Prussian minister president in 1862. The cooperation of Bismarck, Defense Minister Albrecht von Roon, and Field Marshal Helmut von Moltke set the stage for the military victories over Denmark, Austria, and France, that led to the unification of Germany.

In 1863–1864, disputes between Prussia and Denmark over Schleswig escalated, which was not part of the German Confederation, and which Danish nationalists wanted to incorporate into the Danish kingdom. The conflict led to the Second War of Schleswig in 1864. Prussia, joined by Austria, easily defeated Denmark and occupied Jutland. The Danes were forced to cede both the Duchy of Schleswig and the Duchy of Holstein to Austria and Prussia. The subsequent management of the two duchies led to tensions between Austria and Prussia. Austria wanted the duchies to become an independent entity within the German Confederation, while Prussia intended to annex them. The disagreement served as a pretext for the Seven Weeks War between Austria and Prussia, that broke out in June 1866. In July, the two armies clashed at Sadowa-Königgrätz (Bohemia) in an enormous battle involving half a million men. Prussian superior logistics and the modern breech-loading needle guns superiority over the slow muzzle-loading rifles of the Austrians, proved to be elementary for Prussia&#x27;s victory. The battle had also decided the struggle for hegemony in Germany and Bismarck was deliberately lenient with defeated Austria, that was to play only a subordinate role in future German affairs.

====North German Confederation, 1866–1871====
After the Seven Weeks War, the German Confederation was dissolved and the North German Federation (German &quot;Norddeutscher Bund&quot;) was established under the leadership of Prussia. Austria was excluded and its immense influence over Germany finally came to an end. The North German Federation was a transitional organisation that existed from 1867 to 1871, between the dissolution of the German Confederation and the founding of the German Empire.

==German Empire, 1871–1918==
===Overview===

Chancellor Otto von Bismarck determined the political course of the German Empire until 1890. He fostered alliances in Europe to contain France on the one hand and aspired to consolidate Germany&#x27;s influence in Europe on the other. His principal domestic policies focused on the suppression of socialism and the reduction of the strong influence of the Roman Catholic Church on its adherents. He issued a series of anti-socialist laws in accord with a set of social laws, that included universal health care, pension plans and other social security programs. His Kulturkampf policies were vehemently resisted by Catholics, who organized political opposition in the Center Party (Zentrum). German industrial and economic power had grown to match Britain by 1900.

In 1888, the young and ambitious Kaiser Wilhelm II became emperor. He rejected advice from experienced politicians and ordered Bismarck&#x27;s resignation in 1890. He opposed Bismarck&#x27;s careful and delicate foreign policy and was determined to pursue colonialist policies, as Britain and France had been doing for centuries. The Kaiser promoted the active colonization of Africa and Asia for the lands that were not already colonies of other European powers. The Kaiser took a mostly unilateral approach in Europe only allied with the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and embarked on a dangerous naval arms race with Britain. His aggressive and erroneous policies greatly contributed to the situation in which the assassination of the Austrian-Hungarian crown prince would spark off World War I.

===Bismarck era===
Bismarck was the dominant personality not just in Germany but in all of Europe and indeed the entire diplomatic world 1870–1890. Historians continue to debate his goals. Lothar Gall and Ernst Engelberg consider Bismarck was a future-oriented modernizer. In sharp contrast, Jonathan Steinberg decided he was basically a traditional Prussian whose highest priorities were to reinforce the monarchy, the Army, and the social and economic dominance of his own Junker class, thereby being responsible for a tragic history after his removal in 1890.

====The new empire====

In 1868, the Spanish queen Isabella II was deposed in the Glorious Revolution, leaving the country&#x27;s throne vacant. When Prussia suggested the Hohenzollern candidate, Prince Leopold as successor, France vehemently objected. The matter evolved into a diplomatic scandal and in July 1870, France resolved to end it in a full-scale war. The conflict was quickly decided as Prussia, joined by forces of a pan-German alliance never gave up the tactical initiative. A series of victories in north-eastern France followed and another French army group was simultaneously encircled at Metz. A few weeks later, the French army contingent under Emperor Napoleon III&#x27;s personal command was finally forced to capitulate in the fortress of Sedan. Napoleon was taken prisoner and a provisional government hastily proclaimed in Paris. The new government resolved to fight on and tried to reorganize the remaining armies while the Germans settled down to besiege Paris. The starving city surrendered in January 1871 and Jules Favre signed the surrender at Versailles. France was forced to pay indemnities of 5 billion francs and cede Alsace-Lorraine to Germany. This conclusion left the French national psyche deeply humiliated and further aggravated the French–German enmity.

During the Siege of Paris, the German princes assembled in the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles on 18 January 1871 and announced the establishment of the German Empire and proclaimed the Prussian King Wilhelm I as German Emperor. The act unified all ethnic German states with the exception of Austria in the Little German solution of a federal economic, political and administrative unit. Bismarck, was appointed to serve as Chancellor.
====A federal empire====

The new empire was a federal union of 25 states that varied considerably in size, demography, constitution, economy, culture, religion and socio-political development. However, even Prussia itself, which accounted for two-thirds of the territory as well as of the population, had emerged from the empire&#x27;s periphery as a newcomer. It also faced colossal cultural and economic internal divisions. The Prussian provinces of Westphalia and the Rhineland for example had been under French control during the previous decades. The local people, who had benefited from the liberal, civil reforms, that were derived from the ideas of the French Revolution, had only little in common with predominantly rural communities in authoritarian and disjointed Junker estates of Pommerania.
The inhabitants of the smaller territorial lands, especially in central and southern Germany greatly rejected the Prussianized concept of the nation and preferred to associate such terms with their individual home state. The Hanseatic port cities of Hamburg, Bremen and Lübeck ranked among the most ferocious opponents of the &quot;so-called contract with Prussia&quot;. As advocates of free trade, they objected to Prussian ideas of economic integration and refused to sign the renewed Zollverein (Custom Union) treaties until 1888. The Hanseatic merchants&#x27; overseas economic success corresponded with their globalist mindset. The citizen of Hamburg, whom Bismark characterized as &quot;extremely irritating&quot; and the German ambassador in London as &quot;the worst Germans we have&quot;, were particularly appalled by Prussian militarism and its unopposed growing influence.

The Prusso-German authorities were aware of necessary integration concepts as the results and the 52% voter turnout of the first imperial elections had clearly demonstrated. Historians increasingly argue, that the nation-state was &quot;forged through empire&quot;. National identity was expressed in bombastic imperial stone iconography and was to be achieved as an imperial people, with &quot;an emperor as head of state and it was to develop imperial ambitions&quot; – domestic, European and global.

Bismarck&#x27;s domestic policies as Chancellor of Germany were based on his effort to universally adopt the idea of the Protestant Prussian state and achieve the clear separation of church and state in all imperial principalities. In the Kulturkampf (lit.: culture struggle) from 1871 to 1878, he tried to minimize the influence of the Roman Catholic Church and its political arm, the Catholic Centre Party, via secularization of all education and introduction of civil marriage, but without success. The Kulturkampf antagonised many Protestants as well as Catholics and was eventually abandoned. The millions of non-German imperial subjects, like the Polish, Danish and French minorities, were left with no choice but to endure discrimination or accept the policies of Germanisation.

==== A three-class system: Aristocracy, middle class, and working class ====

The new Empire provided attractive top level career opportunities for the national nobility in the various branches of the consular and civil services and the army. As a consequence the aristocratic near total control of the civil sector guaranteed a dominant voice in the decision making in the universities and the churches. The 1914 German diplomatic corps consisted of 8 princes, 29 counts, 20 barons, 54 representants of the lower nobility and a mere 11 commoners. These commoners were indiscriminately recruited from elite industrialist and banking families. The consular corps employed numerous commoners, that however, occupied positions of little to no executive power. The Prussian tradition to reserve the highest military ranks for young aristocrats was adopted and the new constitution put all military affairs under the direct control of the Emperor and beyond control of the Reichstag. With its large corps of reserve officers across Germany, the military strengthened its role as &quot;The estate which upheld the nation&quot;, and historian Hans-Ulrich Wehler added: &quot;&quot;it became an almost separate, self-perpetuating caste&quot;.&quot;

Power increasingly was centralized among the 7000 aristocrats, who resided in the national capital of Berlin and neighboring Potsdam. Berlin&#x27;s rapidly increasing rich middle-class copied the aristocracy and tried to marry into it. A peerage could permanently boost a rich industrial family into the upper reaches of the establishment. However, the process tended to work in the other direction as the nobility became industrialists. For example, 221 of the 243 mines in Silesia were owned by nobles or by the King of Prussia himself.

The middle class in the cities grew exponentially, although it never acquired the powerful parliamentary representation and legislative rights as in France, Britain or the United States. The Association of German Women&#x27;s Organizations or BDF was established in 1894 to encompass the proliferating women&#x27;s organizations that had emerged since the 1860s. From the beginning the BDF was a bourgeois organization, its members working toward equality with men in such areas as education, financial opportunities, and political life. Working-class women were not welcome and were organized by the Socialists.

The rise of the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (later known as the Social Democratic Party of Germany, SPD), aimed to peacefully establish a socialist order through the transformation of the existing political and social conditions. From 1878, Bismarck tried to oppose the growing social democratic movement by outlawing the party&#x27;s organisation, its assemblies and most of its newspapers. Nonetheless, the Social Democrats grew stronger and Bismarck initiated his social welfare program in 1883 in order to appease the working class.

Bismarck built on a tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that began as early as the 1840s. In the 1880s he introduced old age pensions, accident insurance, medical care, and unemployment insurance that formed the basis of the modern European welfare state. His paternalistic programs won the support of German industry because its goals were to win the support of the working classes for the Empire and reduce the outflow of immigrants to America, where wages were higher but welfare did not exist. Bismarck further won the support of both industry and skilled workers by his high tariff policies, which protected profits and wages from American competition, although they alienated the liberal intellectuals who wanted free trade.

====Kulturkampf====

Bismarck would not tolerate any power outside Germany—as in Rome—having a say in domestic affairs. He launched the Kulturkampf (&quot;culture war&quot;) against the power of the pope and the Catholic Church in 1873, but only in the state of Prussia. This gained strong support from German liberals, who saw the Catholic Church as the bastion of reaction and their greatest enemy. The Catholic element, in turn, saw in the National-Liberals the worst enemy and formed the Center Party.

Catholics, although nearly a third of the national population, were seldom allowed to hold major positions in the Imperial government, or the Prussian government. After 1871, there was a systematic purge of the remaining Catholics; in the powerful interior ministry, which handled all police affairs, the only Catholic was a messenger boy. Jews were likewise heavily discriminated against.

Most of the Kulturkampf was fought out in Prussia, but Imperial Germany passed the Pulpit Law which made it a crime for any cleric to discuss public issues in a way that displeased the government. Nearly all Catholic bishops, clergy, and laymen rejected the legality of the new laws and defiantly faced the increasingly heavy penalties and imprisonments imposed by Bismarck&#x27;s government. Historian Anthony Steinhoff reports the casualty totals:

As of 1878, only three of eight Prussian dioceses still had bishops, some 1,125 of 4,600 parishes were vacant, and nearly 1,800 priests ended up in jail or in exile ... Finally, between 1872 and 1878, numerous Catholic newspapers were confiscated, Catholic associations and assemblies were dissolved, and Catholic civil servants were dismissed merely on the pretence of having Ultramontane sympathies.

Bismarck underestimated the resolve of the Catholic Church and did not foresee the extremes that this struggle would attain. The Catholic Church denounced the harsh new laws as anti-Catholic and mustered the support of its rank and file voters across Germany. In the following elections, the Center Party won a quarter of the seats in the Imperial Diet. The conflict ended after 1879 because Pope Pius IX died in 1878 and Bismarck broke with the Liberals to put his main emphasis on tariffs, foreign policy, and attacking socialists. Bismarck negotiated with the conciliatory new pope Leo XIII. Peace was restored, the bishops returned and the jailed clerics were released. Laws were toned down or taken back, but the laws concerning education, civil registry of marriages and religious disaffiliation remained in place. The Center Party gained strength and became an ally of Bismarck, especially when he attacked socialism.

Historians have cited the campaign against the Catholic church, as well as a similar campaign against the Social Democratic Party, as leaving a lasting influence on the German consciousness, whereby national unity can be encouraged by excluding or persecuting a minority. This strategy, later referred to as &quot;negative integration&quot;, set a tone of either being loyal to the government or an enemy of the state, which directly influenced German nationalist sentiment and the later Nazi movement.

====Foreign policies and relations====

Chancellor Bismarck&#x27;s imperial foreign policy basically aimed at security and the prevention of a Franco-Russian alliance, in order to avoid a likely Two-front war. The League of Three Emperors was signed in 1873 by Russia, Austria, and Germany. It stated that republicanism and socialism were common enemies and that the three powers would discuss any matters concerning foreign policy. Bismarck needed good relations with Russia in order to keep France isolated. Russia fought a victorious war against the Ottoman Empire from 1877 to 1878 and attempted to establish the Principality of Bulgaria, that was strongly opposed by France and Britain in particular, as they were long concerned with the preservation of the Ottoman Empire and Russian containment at the Bosphorus Strait and the Black Sea. Germany hosted the Congress of Berlin in 1878, where a more moderate peace settlement was agreed upon.

In 1879, Germany formed the Dual Alliance with Austria-Hungary, an agreement of mutual military assistance in the case of an attack from Russia, which was not satisfied with the agreement of the Congress of Berlin. The establishment of the Dual Alliance led Russia to take a more conciliatory stance and in 1887, the so-called Reinsurance Treaty was signed between Germany and Russia. In it, the two powers agreed on mutual military support in the case that France attacked Germany or an Austrian attack on Russia. Russia turned its attention eastward to Asia and remained largely inactive in European politics for the next 25 years. In 1882, Italy, seeking supporters for its interests in North Africa against France&#x27;s colonial policy, joined the Dual Alliance, which became the Triple Alliance. In return for German and Austrian support, Italy committed itself to assisting Germany in the case of a French attack.

Bismarck had always argued that the acquisition of overseas colonies was impractical and the burden of administration and maintenance would outweigh the benefits. Eventually, Bismarck gave way, and a number of colonies were established in Africa (Togo, the Cameroons, German South-West Africa, and German East Africa) and in Oceania (German New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Marshall Islands). Consequently, Bismarck initiated the Berlin Conference of 1885, a formal meeting of the European colonial powers, who sought to &quot;established international guidelines for the acquisition of African territory&quot; (see Colonisation of Africa). Its outcome, the &quot;General Act of the Berlin Conference&quot;, can be seen as the formalisation of the &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot; and &quot;New Imperialism&quot;.

===Wilhelminian Era (1888–1918)===

====Wilhelm II====

Emperor William I died in 1888. His son Frederick III, open for a more liberal political course, reigned only for ninety-nine days, as he was stricken with throat cancer and died three months after his coronation. His son Wilhelm II followed him on the throne at the age of 29. Wilhelm rejected the liberal ideas of his parents and embarked on a conservative autocratic rule. He early on decided to replace the political elite and in March 1890 he forced chancellor Bismarck into retirement. Following his principle of &quot;Personal Regiment&quot;, Wilhelm was determined to exercise maximum influence on all government affairs.

====Alliances and diplomacy====
The young Kaiser Wilhelm set out to apply his imperialist ideas of &quot;Weltpolitik&quot; (, &quot;world politics&quot;), as he envisaged a gratuitously aggressive political course to increase the empire&#x27;s influence in and control over the world. After the removal of Bismarck, foreign policies were tackled with by the Kaiser and the Federal Foreign Office under Friedrich von Holstein. Wilhelm&#x27;s increasingly erratic and reckless conduct was unmistakably related to character deficits and the lack of diplomatic skills. The foreign office&#x27;s rather sketchy assessment of the current situation and its recommendations for the empire&#x27;s most suitable course of action were:
First a long-term coalition between France and Russia had to fall apart, secondly, Russia and Britain would never get together, and finally, Britain would eventually seek an alliance with Germany.
Subsequently, Wilhelm refused to renew the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia. Russia promptly formed a closer relationship with France in the Dual Alliance of 1894, as both countries were concerned about the novel disagreeability of Germany. Furthermore, Anglo–German relations provided, from a British point of view, no basis for any consensus as the Kaiser refused to divert from his, although somewhat peculiarly desperate and anachronistic, aggressive imperial engagement and the naval arms race in particular. Holstein&#x27;s analysis proved to be mistaken on every point and Wilhelm failed too, as he did not adopt a nuanced political dialogue. Germany was left gradually isolated and dependent on the Triple Alliance, with Austria-Hungary and Italy. This agreement was hampered by differences between Austria and Italy and in 1915 Italy left the alliance.

In 1897, Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, state secretary of the German Imperial Naval Office devised his initially rather practical, yet nonetheless ambitious plan to build a sizeable naval force. Although basically posing only an indirect threat as a Fleet in being, Tirpitz theorized, that its mere existence would force Great Britain, dependent on unrestricted movement on the seas, to agree to diplomatic compromises. Tirpitz started the program of warship construction in 1898 and enjoyed the full support of Kaiser Wilhelm. Wilhelm entertained less rational ideas on the fleet, that circled around his romantic childhood dream to have a &quot;fleet of own some day&quot; and his obsessive adherence to direct his policies along the line of Alfred Thayer Mahan&#x27;s work The Influence of Sea Power upon History. In exchange for the eastern African island of Zanzibar, Germany had bargained the island of Heligoland in the German Bight with Britain in 1890, and converted the island into a naval base and installed immense coastal defense batteries. Britain considered the imperial German endeavours to be a dangerous infringement on the century-old delicate balance of global affairs and trade on the seas under British control. The British, however, resolved to keep up the naval arms race and introduced the highly advanced new &quot;Dreadnought&quot; battleship concept in 1907. Germany quickly adopted the concept and by 1910 the arms race again escalated.

In the First Moroccan Crisis of 1905, Germany nearly clashed with Britain and France when the latter attempted to establish a protectorate over Morocco. Kaiser Wilhelm II was upset at having not been informed about French intentions, and declared their support for Moroccan independence. William II made a highly provocative speech regarding this. The following year, a conference was held in which all of the European powers except Austria-Hungary (by now little more than a German satellite) sided with France. A compromise was brokered by the United States where the French relinquished some, but not all, control over Morocco.

The Second Moroccan Crisis of 1911 saw another dispute over Morocco erupt when France tried to suppress a revolt there. Germany, still smarting from the previous quarrel, agreed to a settlement whereby the French ceded some territory in central Africa in exchange for Germany&#x27;s renouncing any right to intervene in Moroccan affairs. This confirmed French control over Morocco, which became a full protectorate of that country in 1912.

====Economy====

By 1890, the economy continued to industrialize and grow on an even higher rate than during the previous two decades and increased dramatically in the years leading up to World War I. Growth rates for the individual branches and sectors often varied considerably, and periodical figures provided by the &quot;Kaiserliches Statistisches Amt&quot; (&quot;Imperial Statistical Bureau) are often disputed or just assessments. Classification and naming of internationally traded commodities and exported goods was still in progress and the structure of production and export had changed during four decades. Published documents provide numbers such as: The proportion of goods manufactured by the modern industry was approximately 25% in 1900, while the proportion of consumer related products in manufactured exports stood at 40%. Reasonably exact are the figures for the entire industrial production between 1870 and 1914, which increased about 500%.

Historian J. A. Perkins argued that more important than Bismarck&#x27;s new tariff on imported grain was the introduction of the sugar beet as a main crop. Farmers quickly abandoned traditional, inefficient practices in favor of modern methods, including the use of artificial fertilizers and mechanical tools. Intensive methodical farming of sugar and other root crops made Germany the most efficient agricultural producer in Europe by 1914. Even so, farms were usually small in size and women did much of the field work. An unintended consequence was the increased dependence on migratory, especially foreign, labor.
The basics of the modern chemical research laboratory layout and the introduction of essential equipment and instruments such as Bunsen burners, the Petri dish, the Erlenmeyer flask, task-oriented working principles and team research originated in 19th-century Germany and France. The organisation of knowledge acquisition was further refined by laboratory integration in research institutes of the universities and the industries. Germany acquired the leading role in the world&#x27;s chemical industry by the late 19th century through strictly organized methodology. In 1913, the German chemical industry produced almost 90 per cent of the global supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80 per cent of its production abroad.

Germany became Europe&#x27;s leading steel-producing nation in the 1890s, thanks in large part to the protection from American and British competition afforded by tariffs and cartels. The leading firm was &quot;Friedrich Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp&quot;, run by the Krupp family. The merger of several major firms into the &quot;Vereinigte Stahlwerke&quot; (United Steel Works) in 1926 was modeled on the U.S. Steel corporation in the United States. The new company emphasized rationalization of management structures and modernization of the technology; it employed a multi-divisional structure and used return on investment as its measure of success. By 1913, American and German exports dominated the world steel market, as Britain slipped to third place.

In machinery, iron and steel, and other industries, German firms avoided cut-throat competition and instead relied on trade associations. Germany was a world leader because of its prevailing &quot;corporatist mentality&quot;, its strong bureaucratic tradition, and the encouragement of the government. These associations regulate competition and allowed small firms to function in the shadow of much larger companies.

====Colonies====

By the 1890s, German colonial expansion in Asia and the Pacific (Kiauchau in China, the Marianas, the Caroline Islands, Samoa) led to frictions with Britain, Russia, Japan and the United States. The construction of the Baghdad Railway, financed by German banks, was designed to eventually connect Germany with the Turkish Empire and the Persian Gulf, but it also collided with British and Russian geopolitical interests.

The largest colonial enterprises were in Africa. The harsh treatment of the Nama and Herero in what is now Namibia in Africa in 1906–1907 led to charges of genocide against the Germans. Historians are examining the links and precedents between the Herero and Namaqua Genocide and the Holocaust of the 1940s.

Other claimed territories of the German Colonial Empire are: Bear Island (occupied in 1899), Togo-Hinterlands, German Somali Coast, Katanga Territories, Pondoland (failed attempt by ), Nyassaland (Mozambique), Southwestern Madagascar, Santa Lucia Bay (South Africa) (failed attempt in 1884), and the Farasan Islands.

===World War I===

====Causes====
Ethnic demands for nation states upset the balance between the empires that dominated Europe, leading to World War I, which started in August 1914. Germany stood behind its ally Austria in a confrontation with Serbia, but Serbia was under the protection of Russia, which was allied to France. Germany was the leader of the Central Powers, which included Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and later Bulgaria; arrayed against them were the Allies, consisting chiefly of Russia, France, Britain, and in 1915 Italy.

In explaining why neutral Britain went to war with Germany, author Paul M. Kennedy recognized it was critical for war that Germany become economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Central and Eastern Europe, high-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure-groups. Germany&#x27;s reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a necessary military tactic or a profound moral crime. The German invasion of Belgium was not important because the British decision had already been made and the British were more concerned with the fate of France. Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London&#x27;s fear that a repeat of 1870 – when Prussia and the German states smashed France – would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France. British policy makers insisted that would be a catastrophe for British security.

====Western Front====

In the west, Germany sought a quick victory by encircling Paris using the Schlieffen Plan. But it failed due to Belgian resistance, Berlin&#x27;s diversion of troops, and very stiff French resistance on the Marne, north of Paris. The Western Front became an extremely bloody battleground of trench warfare. The stalemate lasted from 1914 until early 1918, with ferocious battles that moved forces a few hundred yards at best along a line that stretched from the North Sea to the Swiss border. The British imposed a tight naval blockade in the North Sea which lasted until 1919, sharply reducing Germany&#x27;s overseas access to raw materials and foodstuffs. Food scarcity became a serious problem by 1917. The United States joined with the Allies in April 1917. The entry of the United States into the war – following Germany&#x27;s declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare – marked a decisive turning-point against Germany.

Total casualties on the Western Front were 3,528,610 killed and 7,745,920 wounded.

====Eastern Front====
More wide open was the fighting on the Eastern Front. In the east, there were decisive victories against the Russian army, the trapping and defeat of large parts of the Russian contingent at the Battle of Tannenberg, followed by huge Austrian and German successes. The breakdown of Russian forces – exacerbated by internal turmoil caused by the 1917 Russian Revolution – led to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk the Bolsheviks were forced to sign on 3 March 1918 as Russia withdrew from the war. It gave Germany control of Eastern Europe. Spencer Tucker says, &quot;The German General Staff had formulated extraordinarily harsh terms that shocked even the German negotiator.&quot; When Germany later complained that the Treaty of Versailles of 1919 was too harsh on them, the Allies responded that it was more benign than Brest-Litovsk.

====1918====
By defeating Russia in 1917, Germany was able to bring hundreds of thousands of combat troops from the east to the Western Front, giving it a numerical advantage over the Allies. By retraining the soldiers in new storm-trooper tactics, the Germans expected to unfreeze the Battlefield and win a decisive victory before the American army arrived in strength. However, the spring offensives all failed, as the Allies fell back and regrouped, and the Germans lacked the reserves necessary to consolidate their gains. In the summer, with the Americans arriving at 10,000 a day, and the German reserves exhausted, it was only a matter of time before multiple Allied offenses destroyed the German army.

====Homefront====
Although war was not expected in 1914, Germany rapidly mobilized its civilian economy for the war effort, the economy was handicapped by the British blockade that cut off food supplies.

Steadily conditions deteriorated rapidly on the home front, with severe food shortages reported in all urban areas. Causes involved the transfer of many farmers and food workers into the military, an overburdened railroad system, shortages of coal, and especially the British blockade that cut off imports from abroad. The winter of 1916–1917 was known as the &quot;turnip winter&quot;, because that vegetable, usually fed to livestock, was used by people as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce. Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry people, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even the army had to cut the rations for soldiers. Morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink. According to historian William H. MacNeil:
:By 1917, after three years of war, the various groups and bureaucratic hierarchies which had been operating more or less independently of one another in peacetime (and not infrequently had worked at cross purposes) were subordinated to one (and perhaps the most effective) of their number: the General Staff. Military officers controlled civilian government officials, the staffs of banks, cartels, firms, and factories, engineers and scientists, workingmen, farmers-indeed almost every element in German society; and all efforts were directed in theory and in large degree also in practice to forwarding the war effort.

1918 was the year of the deadly 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic which struck hard at a population weakened by years of malnutrition.

===Revolution 1918–1919===
In October 1918, General Ludendorff, who wanted to protect the reputation of the Imperial Army by placing responsibility for the capitulation on the democratic parties and the Imperial Reichstag, pushed for the government to be democratised. A new chancellor was appointed, members of the Reichstag&#x27;s majority parties were brought into the cabinet for the first time and the constitution modified. The moves did not, however, satisfy either the Allies or the majority of German citizens.

The German revolution of 1918–1919 began on 3 November with a sailor&#x27;s mutiny at Kiel which spread rapidly and all but bloodlessly across Germany. Within a week, workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils were in control of government and military institutions across most of the Reich. On 9 November, Germany was declared a republic. The following day, the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies, formed from members of Germany&#x27;s two main socialist parties, began acting as the provisional government. By the end of the month, all of Germany&#x27;s ruling monarchs, including Emperor Wilhelm II, who had fled to exile in the Netherlands, had been forced to abdicate.

In early January 1919, the Spartacist uprising led by the newly founded Communist Party of Germany attempted to take power in Berlin, but it was quashed by government and Freikorps troops. Into the spring there were additional violently suppressed efforts to push the revolution further in the direction of a council republic, such as the short-lived local soviet republics, notably in Bavaria (Munich). They too were put down with considerable loss of life.

The revolution&#x27;s end is generally set at 11 August 1919, the day the Weimar Constitution was signed following its adoption by the popularly elected Weimar National Assembly, Even though the widespread violence largely ended in 1919, the revolution remained in many ways incomplete. A large number of its opponents had been left in positions of power in the military and the Reich administration, and it failed to resolve the fracture in the Left between moderate socialists and communists. The Weimar Republic as a result was beset from the beginning by opponents from both the Left and – to a greater degree – the Right.

==Weimar Republic, 1918–1933==
=== Overview ===
Under the peace terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany&#x27;s first democracy began its fourteen-year life facing territorial losses, reparations to the victors of World War I and stringent limitations on its military. Political violence from those on the Right who wanted a return to the monarchy and those on the Left who wanted a soviet-style regime repeatedly threatened the moderate socialist government through 1923. Ongoing issues with the payment of reparations fuelled the hyperinflation of 1923 that impoverished many Germans and left them bitter enemies of the Republic. A period of relative political and economic stability that lasted until the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 was followed by the rapid growth of parties on the extremes – the Communists on the Left and the Nazis on the Right – that left the Reichstag (parliament) all but unable to function. In quick succession, four chancellors tried and failed to govern by decree before President Hindenburg named Adolf Hitler chancellor in 1933. In only a few months he had turned the Republic into a Nazi dictatorship.

=== Treaty of Versailles ===
The Armistice of 11 November 1918 ended the fighting in World War I, and on 28 June 1919 Germany reluctantly signed the peace terms laid out in the Treaty of Versailles. Germany had to renounce sovereignty over its colonies and in Europe lost 65,000 km2 (25,000 sq mi) or about 13% of its former territory – including 48% of its iron and 10% of its coal resources – along with 7 million people, or 12% of its population. Allied troops occupied the Rhineland, and it along with an area stretching 50 kilometres east of the Rhine were demilitarized. The German army was limited to no more than 100,000 men with 4,000 officers and no general staff; the navy could have at most 15,000 men and 1,500 officers. Germany was prohibited from having an air force, submarines or dreadnoughts. A large number of its ships and all of its air-related armaments were to be surrendered. The most contentious article of the treaty, the so-called War Guilt Clause (Article 231), stated that Germany accepted full responsibility for all the loss and damage from the war and therefore had to pay reparations to the Allied Powers.

The treaty was reviled as a dictated rather than a negotiated peace. Philipp Scheidemann, the Social Democratic minister president of Germany, said to the Weimar National Assembly on 12 May 1919, &quot;What hand should not wither that puts this fetter on itself and on us?&quot;

===The early years===
The Weimar Constitution established a federal semi-presidential republic with a chancellor dependent on the confidence of the Reichstag (parliament), a strong president who had considerable powers to govern by decree, and a substantial set of individual rights. The Social Democrat Friedrich Ebert was the Republic&#x27;s first president.

The Left accused the Social Democrats of betraying the ideals of the labour movement because of their alliance with the old elites in the military and administration, and the Right held the supporters of the Republic responsible for Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war. In early 1920, the right-wing Kapp Putsch, backed by units of the paramilitary Freikorps, briefly took control of the government in Berlin, but the putsch quickly collapsed due to a general strike and passive resistance by civil servants. In the putsch&#x27;s wake, workers in the industrial Ruhr district, where dissatisfaction with the lack of nationalisation of key industries was particularly high, rose up and attempted to take control of the region. Reichswehr and Freikorps units suppressed the Ruhr uprising with the loss of over 1,000 lives. The unstable political conditions of the period were reflected in the Reichstag election of 1920, in which the centre-left Weimar Coalition, which until then had held a three-quarters majority, lost 125 seats to parties on both the Left and Right.

Political violence continued at a high level through 1923. A right-wing extremist group assassinated former finance minister Matthias Erzberger in August 1921 and Walther Rathenau, the Jewish foreign minister, in June 1922. 1923 saw the communist-led takeover attempt known as the German October, the right-wing Küstrin Putsch and Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Beer Hall Putsch.

Germany was the first state to establish diplomatic relations with the new Soviet Union in the 1922 Treaty of Rapallo. In October 1925, Germany, France, Belgium, Britain and Italy signed the Treaty of Locarno, which recognised Germany&#x27;s borders with France and Belgium but left its eastern borders open to negotiations. The treaty paved the way for Germany&#x27;s admission to the League of Nations in 1926.

In May 1921 the Allied Powers set Germany&#x27;s reparations liability under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles at 132 billion Reichsmarks, to be paid either in gold or commodities such as iron, steel and coal. After a series of German defaults, French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr in January 1923. The German government responded with a policy of passive resistance. It underwrote the costs of idled factories and mines and paid the workers who were on strike. Unable to meet the enormous costs by any other means, it resorted to printing money. Along with the debts the state had incurred during the war, it was one of the major causes of the 1923 peak in Germany&#x27;s post-war hyperinflation. The passive resistance was called off in September 1923, and the occupation ended in August 1925, following an agreement (the Dawes Plan) to restructure Germany&#x27;s reparations. In November 1923 the government introduced a new currency, the Rentenmark (later the Reichsmark). Together with other measures, it quickly stopped the hyperinflation, but many Germans who lost their life savings became bitter enemies of the Weimar Republic and supporters of the anti-democratic Right. During the following six years the economic situation improved. In 1928 Germany&#x27;s industrial production surpassed the pre-war level of 1913.
In 1925, following the death in office of President Ebert, conservative Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg was elected to replace him. His presidency, coming after a campaign that emphasised nationalism and Hindenburg&#x27;s ties to the fallen German Empire, was the beginning of a significant shift to the right in German politics.

===Economic collapse and end of the Republic, 1929–1933===
The Wall Street crash of 1929 marked the beginning of the worldwide Great Depression, which hit Germany as hard as any nation. In 1931 several major banks failed, and by early 1932 the number of unemployed had soared to more than six million. In the Reichstag election of September 1930, the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) gained 23 seats, while the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (NSDAP, Nazi Party), until then a minor far-right party, increased its share by 95 seats, becoming Germany&#x27;s second largest party behind the Social Democrats. The Nazis were particularly successful among Protestants, unemployed young voters, the lower middle class in the cities and the rural population. It was weakest in Catholic areas and in large cities. The shift to the political extremes made the unstable coalition system by which every Weimar chancellor had governed increasingly unworkable. The last years of the Weimar Republic were marred by even more systemic political instability than previous years, and political violence increased. Four chancellors (Heinrich Brüning, Franz von Papen, Kurt von Schleicher and, from 30 January to 23 March 1933, Adolf Hitler) governed through presidential decree rather than parliamentary consultation. It effectively rendered the Reichstag powerless as a means of enforcing constitutional checks and balances.

Hindenburg was re-elected president in 1932, out-polling Hitler by almost 6 million votes in the second round. The Nazi Party became the largest party in the Reichstag following the election of July 1932. It received 37% of the vote, with the SPD second (22%) and the Communist KPD third at 14%. The Nazis dropped to 33% after another election four months later, but they remained the largest party. The splintered Reichstag was still unable to form a stable coalition. On 30 January 1933, seeing no other viable option and pressured by former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservatives, President Hindenburg appointed Hitler chancellor.

===Science and culture in 19th and 20th century===

The Weimar years saw a flowering of German science and high culture, before the Nazi regime resulted in a decline in the scientific and cultural life in Germany and forced many renowned scientists and writers to flee.
German recipients dominated the Nobel prizes in science. Germany dominated the world of physics before 1933, led by Hermann von Helmholtz, Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, Albert Einstein, Otto Hahn, Max Planck and Werner Heisenberg. Chemistry likewise was dominated by German professors and researchers at the great chemical companies such as BASF and Bayer and persons like Justus von Liebig, Fritz Haber and Emil Fischer. Theoretical mathematicians Georg Cantor in the 19th century and David Hilbert in the 20th century. Karl Benz, the inventor of the automobile, and Rudolf Diesel were pivotal figures of engineering, and Wernher von Braun, rocket engineer. Ferdinand Cohn, Robert Koch and Rudolph Virchow were three key figures in microbiology.

Among the most important German writers were Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse and Bertolt Brecht. The reactionary historian Oswald Spengler wrote &quot;The Decline of the West&quot; (1918–1923) on the inevitable decay of Western Civilization, and influenced intellectuals in Germany such as Martin Heidegger, Max Scheler, and the Frankfurt School, as well as intellectuals around the world.

After 1933, Nazi proponents of &quot;Aryan physics&quot;, led by the Nobel Prize-winners Johannes Stark and Philipp Lenard, attacked Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity as a degenerate example of Jewish materialism in the realm of science. Many scientists and humanists emigrated; Einstein moved permanently to the U.S. but some of the others returned after 1945.
==Nazi Germany, 1933–1945==

The Nazi regime suppressed labor unions and strikes, leading to prosperity which gave the Nazi Party popularity, with only minor, isolated and subsequently unsuccessful cases of resistance among the German population over their rule. The Gestapo (secret police) destroyed the political opposition and persecuted the Jews, trying to force them into exile. The Party took control of the courts, local government, and all civic organizations except the Christian churches. All expressions of public opinion were controlled the propaganda ministry, which used film, mass rallies, and Hitler&#x27;s hypnotic speaking. The Nazi state idolized Hitler as its Führer (leader), putting all powers in his hands. Nazi propaganda centered on Hitler and created the &quot;Hitler Myth&quot;—that Hitler was all-wise and that any mistakes or failures by others would be corrected when brought to his attention. In fact Hitler had a narrow range of interests and decision making was diffused among overlapping, feuding power centers; on some issues he was passive, simply assenting to pressures from whoever had his ear. All top officials reported to Hitler and followed his basic policies, but they had considerable autonomy on a daily basis.

===Establishment of the Nazi regime===

To secure a &quot;Reichstag&quot; majority for his party, Hitler called for new elections. After the 27 February 1933 Reichstag fire, Hitler swiftly blamed an alleged Communist uprising, and convinced President Hindenburg to approve the Reichstag Fire Decree, rescinding civil liberties. Four thousand communists were arrested and Communist agitation was banned. Communists and Socialists were brought into hastily prepared Nazi concentration camps, where they were at the mercy of the Gestapo, the newly established secret police force. Communist &quot;Reichstag&quot; deputies were taken into &quot;protective custody&quot;.
Despite the terror and unprecedented propaganda, the last free General Elections of 5 March 1933, while resulting in 43.9% failed to give the Nazis their desired majority. Together with the German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP), however, he was able to form a slim majority government. On 23 March 1933, the Enabling Act marked the beginning of Nazi Germany, allowing Hitler and his cabinet to enact laws on their own without the President or the Reichstag. The Enabling Act formed the basis for the dictatorship and the dissolution of the Länder. Trade unions and all political parties other than the Nazi Party were suppressed. A centralised totalitarian state was established, no longer based on the liberal Weimar constitution. Germany withdrew from the League of Nations shortly thereafter. The coalition parliament was rigged by defining the absence of arrested and murdered deputies as voluntary and therefore cause for their exclusion as wilful absentees. The Centre Party was voluntarily dissolved in a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; with the Pope under the &quot;anti-communist&quot; Pope Pius XI for the &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot;; and by these manoeuvres Hitler achieved movement of these Catholic voters into the Nazi Party, and a long-awaited international diplomatic acceptance of his regime. The Nazis gained a larger share of their vote in Protestant areas than in Catholic areas. The Communist Party was proscribed in April 1933.

Hitler used the SS and Gestapo to purge the entire SA leadership—along with a number of Hitler&#x27;s political adversaries in the Night of the Long Knives from 30 June to 2 July 1934. As a reward, the SS became an independent organisation under the command of the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler. Upon Hindenburg&#x27;s death on 2 August 1934, Hitler&#x27;s cabinet passed a law proclaiming the presidency to be vacant and transferred the role and powers of the head of state to Hitler.

===Antisemitism and the Holocaust===

The Nazi regime was particularly hostile towards Jews, who became the target of unending antisemitic propaganda attacks. The Nazis attempted to convince the German people to view and treat Jews as &quot;subhumans&quot; and immediately after the 1933 federal elections the Nazis imposed a nationwide boycott of Jewish businesses. In March 1933 the first Nazi concentration camp was established at Dachau and from 1933 to 1935 the Nazi regime consolidated their power. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service forced all Jewish civil servants to retire from the legal profession and the civil service. The Nuremberg Laws banned sexual relations between Jews and Germans and only those of German or related blood were eligible to be considered citizens; the remainder were classed as state subjects, without citizenship rights. This stripped Jews, Romani and others of their legal rights. Jews continued to suffer persecution under the Nazi regime, exemplified by the Kristallnacht pogrom of 1938, and about half of Germany&#x27;s 500,000 Jews fled the country before 1939, after which escape became almost impossible.

In 1941, the Nazi leadership decided to implement a plan that they called the &quot;Final Solution&quot; which came to be known as the Holocaust. Under the plan, Jews and other &quot;lesser races&quot; along with political opponents from Germany as well as occupied countries were systematically murdered at murder sites, and starting in 1942, at extermination camps. Between 1941 and 1945 Jews, Gypsies, Slavs, communists, homosexuals, the mentally and physically disabled and members of other groups were targeted and methodically murdered – the origin of the word &quot;genocide&quot;. In total approximately 11 million people were killed during the Holocaust.

===Military===


In 1935, Hitler officially re-established the Luftwaffe (air force) and reintroduced universal military service, in breach of the Treaty of Versailles; Britain, France and Italy formally protested. Hitler had the officers swear their personal allegiance to him. In 1936, German troops marched into the demilitarised Rhineland. As the territory was part of Germany, the British and French governments did not feel that attempting to enforce the treaty was worth the risk of war. The move strengthened Hitler&#x27;s standing in Germany. His reputation swelled further with the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and proved another great propaganda success for the regime as orchestrated by master propagandist Joseph Goebbels.

===Foreign policy===

Hitler&#x27;s diplomatic strategy in the 1930s was to make seemingly reasonable demands, threatening war if they were not met. When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the League of Nations, rejected the Versailles Treaty and began to re-arm, won back the Saar, remilitarized the Rhineland, formed an alliance with Mussolini&#x27;s Italy, sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War, annexed Austria, took over Czechoslovakia after the British and French &quot;appeasement&quot; of the Munich Agreement, formed a peace pact with Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union, and finally invaded Poland. Britain and France declared war on Germany and World War II in Europe began.

Having established a &quot;Rome-Berlin axis&quot; with Benito Mussolini, and signing the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan – which was joined by Italy a year later in 1937 – Hitler felt able to take the offensive in foreign policy. On 12 March 1938, German troops marched into Austria, where an attempted Nazi coup had been unsuccessful in 1934. When Austrian-born Hitler entered Vienna, he was greeted by loud cheers and Austrians voted in favour of the annexation of their country. After Austria, Hitler turned to Czechoslovakia, where the Sudeten German minority was demanding equal rights and self-government. At the Munich Conference of September 1938, Hitler, Mussolini, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier agreed upon the cession of Sudeten territory to the German Reich by Czechoslovakia. Hitler thereupon declared that all of German Reich&#x27;s territorial claims had been fulfilled. However, hardly six months after the Munich Agreement Hitler used the smoldering quarrel between Slovaks and Czechs as a pretext for taking over the rest of Czechoslovakia. He then secured the return of Memel from Lithuania to Germany. Chamberlain was forced to acknowledge that his policy of appeasement towards Hitler had failed.

===World War II===
At first Germany was successful in its military operations. In less than three months (April – June 1940), Germany conquered Denmark, Norway, the Low Countries, and France. The unexpectedly swift defeat of France resulted in an upswing in Hitler&#x27;s popularity and an upsurge in war fever. Hitler made peace overtures to the new British leader Winston Churchill in July 1940, but Churchill remained dogged in his defiance with major help from US president Franklin D. Roosevelt. Hitler&#x27;s bombing campaign against Britain (September 1940 – May 1941) failed. Some 43,000 British civilians were killed and 139,000 wounded in the Blitz; much of London was destroyed. Germany&#x27;s armed forces invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 swept forward until they reached the gates of Moscow. The Einsatzgruppen (Nazi mobile death squads) executed all Soviet Jews that it located, while the Germans went to Jewish households and forced the families into concentration camps for labor or to extermination camps for death.

The tide began to turn in December 1941, when the invasion of the Soviet Union hit determined resistance in the Battle of Moscow and Hitler declared war on the United States in the wake of the Japanese Pearl Harbor attack. After surrender in North Africa and losing the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942–1943, the Germans were forced into the defensive. By late 1944, the United States, Canada, France, and Great Britain were closing in on Germany in the West, while the Soviets were victoriously advancing in the East.
In 1944–1945, Soviet forces completely or partially liberated Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Denmark, and Norway. Nazi Germany collapsed as Berlin was taken by the Soviet Union&#x27;s Red Army in a fight to the death on the city streets. 2,000,000 Soviet troops took part in the assault, and they faced 750,000 German troops. 78,000–305,000 Soviets were killed, while 325,000 German civilians and soldiers were killed. Hitler committed suicide on 30 April 1945. The final German Instrument of Surrender was signed on 8 May 1945, marking the end of Nazi Germany.

By September 1945, Nazi Germany and its Axis partners (mainly Italy and Japan) had all been defeated, chiefly by the forces of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain. Much of Europe lay in ruins, over 60 million people worldwide had been killed (most of them civilians), including approximately 6 million Jews and 11 million non-Jews in what became known as the Holocaust. World War II destroyed Germany&#x27;s political and economic infrastructure, caused its partition, considerable loss of territory (especially in the East), and historical legacy of guilt and shame.

==Germany during the Cold War, 1945–1990==
As a consequence of the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 and the onset of the Cold War in 1947, the country&#x27;s territory was shrunk and split between the two global blocs in the East and West, a period known as the division of Germany. Millions of refugees from Central and Eastern Europe moved west, most of them to West Germany. Two countries emerged: West Germany was a parliamentary democracy, a NATO member, a founding member of what since became the European Union as one of the world&#x27;s largest economies and under allied military control until 1955, while East Germany was a totalitarian Communist dictatorship controlled by the Soviet Union as a satellite of Moscow. With the collapse of Communism in Europe in 1989, reunion followed.

No one doubted Germany&#x27;s economic and engineering prowess; the question was how long bitter memories of the war would cause Europeans to distrust Germany, and whether Germany could demonstrate it had rejected totalitarianism and militarism and embraced democracy and human rights.

=== Expulsion ===

At the Potsdam Conference, Germany was divided into four military occupation zones by the Allies and did not regain independence until 1949. The provinces east of the Oder and Neisse rivers (the Oder-Neisse line) were transferred to Poland and Soviet Russia (Kaliningrad oblast) while Saarland separated from Germany to become a French protectorate on 17 December 1947 (joined West Germany on 1 January 1957), pending a final peace conference with Germany, which eventually never took place. Most of the remaining German population was expelled. Around 6.7 million Germans living in &quot;west-shifted&quot; Poland, mostly within previously German lands, and the 3 million in German-settled regions of Czechoslovakia were deported west.

===Post-war chaos===
The total of German war dead was 8% to 10% out of a prewar population of 69,000,000, or between 5.5 million and 7 million people. This included 4.5 million in the military, and between 1 and 2 million civilians. There was chaos as 11 million foreign workers and POWs left, while soldiers returned home and more than 14 million displaced German-speaking refugees from both the eastern provinces and East-Central and Eastern Europe were expelled from their native land and came to the western German lands, often foreign to them. During the Cold War, the West German government estimated a death toll of 2.2 million civilians due to the flight and expulsion of Germans and through forced labour in the Soviet Union. This figure remained unchallenged until the 1990s, when some historians put the death toll at 500,000–600,000 confirmed deaths. In 2006, the German government reaffirmed its position that 2.0–2.5 million deaths occurred.

Denazification removed, imprisoned, or executed most top officials of the old regime, but most middle and lower ranks of civilian officialdom were not seriously affected. In accordance with the Allied agreement made at the Yalta Conference, millions of POWs were used as forced labor by the Soviet Union and other European countries.

In the East, the Soviets crushed dissent and imposed another police state, often employing ex-Nazis in the dreaded Stasi. The Soviets extracted about 23% of the East German GNP for reparations, while in the West reparations were a minor factor.

In 1945–1946 housing and food conditions were bad, as the disruption of transport, markets, and finances slowed a return to normal. In the West, bombing had destroyed the fourth of the housing stock, and over 10 million refugees from the east had crowded in, most living in camps. Food production in 1946–1948 was only two-thirds of the prewar level, while grain and meat shipments – which usually supplied 25% of the food – no longer arrived from the East. Furthermore, the end of the war brought the end of large shipments of food seized from occupied nations that had sustained Germany during the war. Coal production was down 60%, which had cascading negative effects on railroads, heavy industry, and heating. Industrial production fell more than half and reached prewar levels only at the end of 1949.

Allied economic policy originally was one of industrial disarmament plus building the agricultural sector. In the western sectors, most of the industrial plants had minimal bomb damage and the Allies dismantled 5% of the industrial plants for reparations.

However, deindustrialization became impractical and the U.S. instead called for a strong industrial base in Germany so it could stimulate European economic recovery. The U.S. shipped food in 1945–1947 and made a $600 million loan in 1947 to rebuild German industry. By May 1946 the removal of machinery had ended, thanks to lobbying by the U.S. Army. The Truman administration finally realised that economic recovery in Europe could not go forward without the reconstruction of the German industrial base on which it had previously been dependent. Washington decided that an &quot;orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany&quot;.

In 1945, the occupying powers took over all newspapers in Germany and purged them of Nazi influence. The American occupation headquarters, the Office of Military Government, United States (OMGUS) began its own newspaper based in Munich, &quot;Die Neue Zeitung.&quot; It was edited by German and Jewish émigrés who fled to the United States before the war. Its mission was to encourage democracy by exposing Germans to how American culture operated. The paper was filled with details on American sports, politics, business, Hollywood, and fashions, as well as international affairs.

===East Germany===
On 7 October 1949, the Soviet zone became the &quot;Deutsche Demokratische Republik&quot; – &quot;DDR&quot; (&quot;German Democratic Republic&quot; – &quot;GDR&quot;, simply often &quot;East Germany&quot;), under control of the Socialist Unity Party. Neither country had a significant army until the 1950s, but East Germany built the Stasi into a powerful secret police that infiltrated every aspect of its society.

East Germany was an Eastern bloc state under political and military control of the Soviet Union through her occupation forces and the Warsaw Treaty. Political power was solely executed by leading members (&quot;Politburo&quot;) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party (SED). A Soviet-style command economy was set up; later the GDR became the most advanced Comecon state. While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR&#x27;s social programs and the alleged constant threat of a West German invasion, many of her citizens looked to the West for political freedoms and economic prosperity.

Walter Ulbricht was the party boss from 1950 to 1971. In 1933, Ulbricht had fled to Moscow, where he served as a Comintern agent loyal to Stalin. As World War II was ending, Stalin assigned him the job of designing the postwar German system that would centralize all power in the Communist Party. Ulbricht became deputy prime minister in 1949 and secretary (chief executive) of the Socialist Unity (Communist) party in 1950. Some 2.6 million people had fled East Germany by 1961 when he built the Berlin Wall to stop them – shooting those who attempted it. What the GDR called the &quot;Anti-Fascist Protective Wall&quot; was a major embarrassment for the program during the Cold War, but it did stabilize East Germany and postpone its collapse. Ulbricht lost power in 1971, but was kept on as a nominal head of state. He was replaced because he failed to solve growing national crises, such as the worsening economy in 1969–1970, the fear of another popular uprising as had occurred in 1953, and the disgruntlement between Moscow and Berlin caused by Ulbricht&#x27;s détente policies toward the West.

The transition to Erich Honecker (General Secretary from 1971 to 1989) led to a change in the direction of national policy and efforts by the Politburo to pay closer attention to the grievances of the proletariat. Honecker&#x27;s plans were not successful, however, with the dissent growing among East Germany&#x27;s population.

In 1989, the socialist regime collapsed after 40 years, despite its omnipresent secret police, the Stasi. The main reasons for its collapse included severe economic problems and growing emigration towards the West.

East Germany&#x27;s culture was shaped by Communism and particularly Stalinism. It was characterized by East German psychoanalyst Hans-Joachim Maaz in 1990 as having produced a &quot;Congested Feeling&quot; among Germans in the East as a result of Communist policies criminalizing personal expression that deviates from government approved ideals, and through the enforcement of Communist principals by physical force and intellectual repression by government agencies, particularly the Stasi. Critics of the East German state have claimed that the state&#x27;s commitment to communism was a hollow and cynical tool of a ruling elite. This argument has been challenged by some scholars who claim that the Party was committed to the advance of scientific knowledge, economic development, and social progress. However, the vast majority regarded the state&#x27;s Communist ideals to be nothing more than a deceptive method for government control.

According to German historian Jürgen Kocka (2010):
:&quot;Conceptualizing the GDR as a dictatorship has become widely accepted, while the meaning of the concept dictatorship varies. Massive evidence has been collected that proves the repressive, undemocratic, illiberal, nonpluralistic character of the GDR regime and its ruling party.&quot;

===West Germany (Bonn Republic)===

On 23 May 1949, the three western occupation zones (American, British, and French) were combined into the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, West Germany). The government was formed under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and his conservative CDU/CSU coalition. The CDU/CSU was in power during most of the period since 1949. The capital was Bonn until it was moved to Berlin in 1990. In 1990, FRG absorbed East Germany and gained full sovereignty over Berlin. At all points West Germany was much larger and richer than East Germany, which became a dictatorship under the control of the Communist Party and was closely monitored by Moscow. Germany, especially Berlin, was a cockpit of the Cold War, with NATO and the Warsaw Pact assembling major military forces in west and east. However, there was never any combat.

====Economic miracle====

West Germany enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s (&quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot; or &quot;Economic Miracle&quot;). Industrial production doubled from 1950 to 1957, and gross national product grew at a rate of 9 or 10% per year, providing the engine for economic growth of all of Western Europe. Labor unions supported the new policies with postponed wage increases, minimized strikes, support for technological modernization, and a policy of co-determination (&quot;Mitbestimmung&quot;), which involved a satisfactory grievance resolution system as well as requiring representation of workers on the boards of large corporations. The recovery was accelerated by the currency reform of June 1948, U.S. gifts of $1.4 billion as part of the Marshall Plan, the breaking down of old trade barriers and traditional practices, and the opening of the global market. West Germany gained legitimacy and respect, as it shed the horrible reputation Germany had gained under the Nazis.

West Germany played a central role in the creation of European cooperation; it joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community in 1958.

==== 1948 currency reform ====
The most dramatic and successful policy event was the currency reform of 1948. Since the 1930s, prices and wages had been controlled, but money had been plentiful. That meant that people had accumulated large paper assets, and that official prices and wages did not reflect reality, as the black market dominated the economy and more than half of all transactions were taking place unofficially. On 21 June 1948, the Western Allies withdrew the old currency and replaced it with the new Deutsche Mark at the rate of 1 new per 10 old. This wiped out 90% of government and private debt, as well as private savings. Prices were decontrolled, and labor unions agreed to accept a 15% wage increase, despite the 25% rise in prices. The result was that prices of German export products held steady, while profits and earnings from exports soared and were poured back into the economy. The currency reforms were simultaneous with the $1.4 billion in Marshall Plan money coming in from the United States, which was used primarily for investment.

In addition, the Marshall Plan forced German companies, as well as those in all of Western Europe, to modernize their business practices and take account of the international market. Marshall Plan funding helped overcome bottlenecks in the surging economy caused by remaining controls (which were removed in 1949), and Marshall Plan business reforms opened up a greatly expanded market for German exports. Overnight, consumer goods appeared in the stores, because they could be sold for realistic prices, emphasizing to Germans that their economy had turned a corner.

The success of the currency reform angered the Soviets, who cut off all road, rail, and canal links between the western zones and West Berlin. This was the Berlin Blockade, which lasted from 24 June 1948 to 12 May 1949. In response, the U.S. and Britain launched an airlift of food and coal and distributed the new currency in West Berlin as well. The city thereby became economically integrated into West Germany. Until the mid-1960s, it served as &quot;America&#x27;s Berlin&quot;, symbolizing the United States&#x27; commitment to defending its freedom, which John F. Kennedy underscored during his visit in June 1963.

==== Adenauer ====

Konrad Adenauer was the dominant leader in West Germany. He was the first chancellor (top official) of the FRG and until his death was the founder and leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), a coalition of conservatives, ordoliberals, and adherents of Protestant and Catholic social teaching that dominated West Germany politics for most of its history. During his chancellorship, the West Germany economy grew quickly, and West Germany established friendly relations with France, participated in the emerging European Union, established the country&#x27;s armed forces (the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;), and became a pillar of NATO as well as firm ally of the United States. Adenauer&#x27;s government also commenced the long process of reconciliation with the Jews and Israel after the Holocaust.

==== Erhard ====
Ludwig Erhard was in charge of economic policy as economics director for the British and American occupation zones and was Adenauer&#x27;s long-time economics minister. Erhard&#x27;s decision to lift many price controls in 1948 (despite opposition from both the social democratic opposition and Allied authorities), plus his advocacy of free markets, helped set the Federal Republic on its strong growth from wartime devastation. Norbert Walter, a former chief economist at Deutsche Bank, argues that &quot;Germany owes its rapid economic advance after World War II to the system of the Social Market Economy, established by Ludwig Erhard.&quot; Erhard was politically less successful when he served as the CDU Chancellor from 1963 until 1966. Erhard followed the concept of a social market economy, and was in close touch with professional economists. Erhard viewed the market itself as social and supported only a minimum of welfare legislation. However, Erhard suffered a series of decisive defeats in his effort to create a free, competitive economy in 1957; he had to compromise on such key issues as the anti-cartel legislation. Thereafter, the West German economy evolved into a conventional west European welfare state.

Meanwhile, in adopting the Godesberg Program in 1959, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) largely abandoned Marxism ideas and embraced the concept of the market economy and the welfare state. Instead it now sought to move beyond its old working class base to appeal the full spectrum of potential voters, including the middle class and professionals. Labor unions cooperated increasingly with industry, achieving labor representation on corporate boards and increases in wages and benefits.

==== Grand coalition ====

In 1966, Erhard lost support and Kurt Kiesinger was elected as Chancellor by a new CDU/CSU-SPD alliance combining the two largest parties. Social democratic (SPD) leader Willy Brandt was Deputy Federal Chancellor and Foreign Minister. The 1966–1969 Grand Coalition reduced tensions with the Soviet bloc nations and establishing diplomatic relations with Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia.

==== Guest workers ====

With a booming economy short of unskilled workers, especially after the Berlin Wall cut off the steady flow of East Germans, the FRG negotiated migration agreements with Italy (1955), Spain (1960), Greece (1960), and Turkey (1961) that brought in hundreds of thousands of temporary guest workers, called &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot;. In 1968, the FRG signed a guest worker agreement with Yugoslavia that employed additional guest workers. &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot; were young men who were paid full-scale wages and benefits, but were expected to return home in a few years.

The agreement with Turkey ended in 1973 but few workers returned because there were few good jobs in Turkey. By 2010 there were about 4 million people of Turkish descent in Germany. The generation born in Germany attended German schools, but had a poor command of either German or Turkish, and had either low-skilled jobs or were unemployed.

==== Brandt and Ostpolitik ====
Willy Brandt was the leader of the Social Democratic Party in 1964–1987 and West German Chancellor in 1969–1974. Under his leadership, the German government sought to reduce tensions with the Soviet Union and improve relations with the German Democratic Republic, a policy known as the &quot;Ostpolitik&quot;. Relations between the two German states had been icy at best, with propaganda barrages in each direction. The heavy outflow of talent from East Germany prompted the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, which worsened Cold War tensions and prevented East Germans from travel. Although anxious to relieve serious hardships for divided families and to reduce friction, Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; was intent on holding to its concept of &quot;two German states in one German nation&quot;.

&quot;Ostpolitik&quot; was opposed by the conservative elements in Germany, but won Brandt an international reputation and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971. In September 1973, both West and East Germany were admitted to the United Nations. The two countries exchanged permanent representatives in 1974, and, in 1987, East Germany&#x27;s leader Erich Honecker paid an official state visit to West Germany.

==== Economic crisis of 1970s ====
After 1973, Germany was hard hit by a worldwide economic crisis, soaring oil prices, and stubbornly high unemployment, which jumped from 300,000 in 1973 to 1.1 million in 1975. The Ruhr region was hardest hit, as its easy-to-reach coal mines petered out, and expensive German coal was no longer competitive. Likewise the Ruhr steel industry went into sharp decline, as its prices were undercut by lower-cost suppliers such as Japan. The welfare system provided a safety net for the large number of unemployed workers, and many factories reduced their labor force and began to concentrate on high-profit specialty items. After 1990 the Ruhr moved into service industries and high technology. Cleaning up the heavy air and water pollution became a major industry in its own right. Meanwhile, formerly rural Bavaria became a high-tech center of industry.

A spy scandal forced Brandt to step down as Chancellor while remaining as party leader. He was replaced by Helmut Schmidt (b. 1918), of the SPD, who served as Chancellor in 1974–1982. Schmidt continued the &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; with less enthusiasm. He had a PhD in economics and was more interested in domestic issues, such as reducing inflation. The debt grew rapidly as he borrowed to cover the cost of the ever more expensive welfare state. After 1979, foreign policy issues grew central as the Cold War turned hot again. The German peace movement mobilized hundreds of thousands of demonstrators to protest against American deployment in Europe of new medium-range ballistic missiles. Schmidt supported the deployment but was opposed by the left wing of the SPD and by Brandt.

The pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP) had been in coalition with the SPD, but now it changed direction. Led by Finance Minister Otto Graf Lambsdorff the FDP adopted the market-oriented &quot;Kiel Theses&quot; in 1977; it rejected the Keynesian emphasis on consumer demand, and proposed to reduce social welfare spending, and try to introduce policies to stimulate production and facilitate jobs. Lambsdorff argued that the result would be economic growth, which would itself solve both the social problems and the financial problems. As a consequence, the FDP switched allegiance to the CDU and Schmidt lost his parliamentary majority in 1982. For the only time in West Germany&#x27;s history, the government fell on a vote of no confidence.

====Kohl====

Helmut Kohl brought the conservatives back to power with a CDU/CSU-FDP coalition in 1982, and served as Chancellor until 1998. He orchestrated reunification with the approval of all the Four Powers from World War II, who still had a voice in German affairs. He lost in the left&#x27;s biggest landslide victory in 1998, and was succeeded by the SPD&#x27;s Gerhard Schröder.

===Reunification===
During the summer of 1989, rapid changes known as &quot;peaceful revolution&quot; or &quot;Die Wende&quot; took place in East Germany, which quickly led to German reunification. Growing numbers of East Germans emigrated to West Germany, many via Hungary after Hungary&#x27;s reformist government opened its borders.

The opening of the Iron Curtain between Austria and Hungary at the Pan-European Picnic in August 1989 then triggered a chain reaction, at the end of which there was no longer a GDR and the Eastern Bloc had disintegrated. Otto von Habsburg&#x27;s idea developed the greatest mass exodus since the construction of the Berlin Wall and it was shown that the USSR and the rulers of the Eastern European satellite states were not ready to keep the Iron Curtain effective. This made their loss of power visible and clear that the GDR no longer received effective support from the other communist Eastern Bloc countries. Thousands of East Germans then tried to reach the West by staging sit-ins at West German diplomatic facilities in other East European capitals, most notably in Prague. The exodus generated demands within East Germany for political change, and mass demonstrations in several cities continued to grow.

Unable to stop the growing civil unrest, Erich Honecker was forced to resign in October, and on 9 November, East German authorities unexpectedly allowed East German citizens to enter West Berlin and West Germany. Hundreds of thousands of people took advantage of the opportunity; new crossing points were opened in the Berlin Wall and along the border with West Germany. This led to the acceleration of the process of reforms in East Germany that ended with the dissolution of East Germany and the German reunification that came into force on 3 October 1990.

==Federal Republic of Germany, 1990–present==


The SPD/Green coalition won the 1998 elections and SPD leader Gerhard Schröder positioned himself as a centrist &quot;Third Way&quot; candidate in the mold of U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. President Bill Clinton. Schröder proposed Agenda 2010, a significant downsizing of the welfare state with five goals: tax cuts; labor market deregulation, especially relaxing rules protecting workers from dismissal and setting up Hartz concept job training; modernizing the welfare state by reducing entitlements; decreasing bureaucratic obstacles for small businesses; and providing new low-interest loans to local governments.

On 26 December 2004 during Boxing Day celebration, about more than nearly 540 Germans have died and many more thousands of Germans are missing from Indian Ocean tsunami from Indonesian earthquake while vacationing in Southern Thailand.

In 2005, after the SPD lost to the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in North Rhine-Westphalia, Gerhard Schröder announced he would call federal elections &quot;as soon as possible&quot;. A motion of confidence was subsequently defeated after Schröder urged members not to vote for his government to trigger new elections. In response, a grouping of left-wing SPD dissidents and the neo-communist Party of Democratic Socialism agreed to run on a joint ticket in the general election, with Schröder&#x27;s rival Oskar Lafontaine leading the new group.

In the 2005 elections, Angela Merkel became the first female chancellor. In 2009 the German government approved a €50 billion stimulus plan. Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of European integration, the energy transition () for a sustainable energy supply, the debt brake for balanced budgets, measures to increase the fertility rate (pronatalism), and high-tech strategies for the transition of the German economy, summarised as Industry 4.0.
From 2005 to 2009 and 2013 to 2021, Germany was ruled by a grand coalition led by the CDU&#x27;s Angela Merkel as chancellor. From 2009 to 2013, Merkel headed a centre-right government of the CDU/CSU and FDP.

Together with France, Italy, Netherlands, and other EU member nations, Germany has played the leading role in the European Union. Germany (especially under Chancellor Helmut Kohl) was one of the main supporters of admitting many East European countries to the EU. Germany is at the forefront of European states seeking to exploit the momentum of monetary union to advance the creation of a more unified and capable European political, defence and security apparatus. German Chancellor Schröder expressed an interest in a permanent seat for Germany in the UN Security Council, identifying France, Russia, and Japan as countries that explicitly backed Germany&#x27;s bid. Germany formally adopted the Euro on 1 January 1999 after permanently fixing the Deutsche Mark rate on 31 December 1998.

Since 1990, German Bundeswehr has participated in a number of peacekeeping and disaster relief operations abroad. Since 2002, German troops formed part of the International Security Assistance Force in the War in Afghanistan, resulting in the first German casualties in combat missions since World War II.

In light of the worldwide Great Recession that began in 2008, Germany did not experience as much economic hardship as other European nations. Germany later sponsored a massive financial rescue in the wake of the Eurozone crisis which affected the German economy.

Following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which led to the Fukushima nuclear disaster, German public opinion turned sharply against nuclear power in Germany, which at the time produced a fourth of the electricity supply. In response Merkel announced plans to close down the nuclear power plants over the following decade, and a commitment to rely more heavily on wind and other alternative energy sources, in addition to coal and natural gas.

Germany was affected by the European migrant crisis in 2015 as it became the final destination of choice for many asylum seekers from Africa and the Middle East entering the EU. The country took in over a million refugees and migrants and developed a quota system which redistributed migrants around its federal states based on their tax income and existing population density. The decision by Merkel to authorize unrestricted entry led to heavy criticism in Germany as well as within Europe. This was a major factor in the rise of the far-right party Alternative for Germany which entered the Bundestag in the 2017 federal election.

===German government response to the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-22)===

In January 2020, Germany has confirmed the first case of novel coronavirus, found from Wuhan, China. In March 2020, Germany went to the national lockdowns, which was greatly affected by the pandemic, and greatly impact on German economy, healthcare system, and society, and also commended for being an effective model for instituting methods of curbing infections and deaths, but lost this status by the end of the year due to rising number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. In December 2020, COVID-19 vaccines began to be administered in Germany. Unfortunately, from June 2021 to the end of March 2022, Germany has might seeing a new surge of huge COVID-19 infection wave, fueled by the highly transmissible Deltacron hybrid variant, which is combined of Delta and Omicron mutations. However, Germany has suffered from a recombination event of Deltacron, which was caused of less access to vaccine shortage in the first quarter. As of May 2022, Germany has reported 140,292 COVID-19-related deaths, the fifth highest mortality toll (Behind Russia, the United Kingdom, Italy, and France), out of 2 million deaths in Europe.

On 8 April 2022 just after the first two years of pandemic, Germany joined France, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus were lifted all COVID-19 restrictions, measures, and state of emergencies up in the future.

===Post-COVID period (Since 2022)===
On 8 December 2021 just three months after Germany&#x27;s centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) narrowly won the federal election, ending 16 years of conservative-led rule under Angela Merkel, Social Democrat Olaf Scholz was sworn in as Germany&#x27;s new chancellor. He formed a coalition government with the Green Party and the liberal Free Democrats.

In February 2022, Frank-Walter Steinmeier was elected for a second five-year term as Germany&#x27;s president. Although largely ceremonial post, he has been seen as a symbol of consensus and continuity.

After Russia&#x27;s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Germany&#x27;s previous foreign policy towards Russia (traditional Ostpolitik) has been severely criticized for having been too credulous and soft. Following concerns from the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Germany announced a major shift in policy, pledging a €100 billion special fund for the Bundeswehrto remedy years of underinvestmentalong with raising the budget to above 2% GDP.
As of April 2023, over 1.06 million refugees from Ukraine were recorded in Germany.

As of December 2023, Germany is the fourth largest economy in the world after the United States, China and Japan and the largest economy in Europe. It is the third largest export nation in the world.

<doc id="13225" wikidata="Q41410" url="?curid=13225" title="Hades">
<text>Hades (; , , later ), in the ancient Greek religion and mythology, is the god of the dead and the king of the underworld, with which his name became synonymous. Hades was the eldest son of Cronus and Rhea, although this also made him the last son to be regurgitated by his father. He and his brothers, Zeus and Poseidon, defeated their father&#x27;s generation of gods, the Titans, and claimed joint rulership over the cosmos. Hades received the underworld, Zeus the sky, and Poseidon the sea, with the solid earth (long the province of Gaia) available to all three concurrently. In artistic depictions, Hades is typically portrayed holding a bident
and wearing his helm with Cerberus, the three-headed guard-dog of the underworld, standing at his side.

Roman-era mythographers eventually equated the Etruscan god Aita
and the Roman gods Dis Pater and Orcus with Hades and merged all these figures into Pluto, a Latinisation of Plouton (), itself a euphemistic title (meaning &quot;the rich one&quot;) often given to Hades.

==Name==

The origin of Hades&#x27;s name is uncertain but has generally been seen as meaning &quot;the unseen one&quot; since antiquity. An extensive section of Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Cratylus&quot; is devoted to the etymology of the god&#x27;s name, in which Socrates is arguing for a folk etymology not from &quot;unseen&quot; but from &quot;his knowledge (&quot;&quot;) of all noble things&quot;. Modern linguists have proposed the Proto-Greek form *&quot;Awides&quot; (&quot;unseen&quot;). The earliest attested form is &quot;Aḯdēs&quot; (), which lacks the proposed digamma. Martin Litchfield West argues instead for an original meaning of &quot;the one who presides over meeting up&quot; from the universality of death.
In Homeric and Ionic Greek, he was known as &quot;Áïdēs&quot;. Other poetic variations of the name include &quot;Aïdōneús&quot; () and the inflected forms &quot;Áïdos&quot; (, gen.), &quot;Áïdi&quot; (, dat.), and &quot;Áïda&quot; (, acc.), whose reconstructed nominative case *&quot;Áïs&quot; () is, however, not attested. The name as it came to be known in classical times was &quot;Háidēs&quot; (). Later the iota became silent, then a subscript marking (), and finally omitted entirely ().

Perhaps from fear of pronouncing his name, around the 5th century BC, the Greeks started referring to Hades as Plouton ( &quot;Ploútōn&quot;, ), with a root meaning &quot;wealthy&quot;, considering that from the abode below (i.e., the soil) come riches (e.g., fertile crops, metals and so on). Plouton became the Roman god who both rules the underworld and distributed riches from below. This deity was a mixture of the Greek god Hades and the Eleusinian icon Ploutos, and from this he also received a priestess, which was not previously practiced in Greece. More elaborate names of the same genre were &quot;Ploutodótēs&quot; (, ) or &quot;Ploutodotḗr&quot; (, ), meaning &quot;giver of wealth&quot;.

Epithets of Hades include &quot;Agesander&quot; (, ) and &quot;Agesilaos&quot; (, ), both from &quot;ágō&quot; (, &quot;lead&quot;, &quot;carry&quot; or &quot;fetch&quot;) and &quot;anḗr&quot; (, &quot;man&quot;) or &quot;laos&quot; (, &quot;men&quot; or &quot;people&quot;), describing Hades as the god who carries away all. Nicander uses the form &quot;Hegesilaus&quot; (, ).

He was also referred to as &quot;Zeus katachthonios&quot; (Ζεὺς καταχθόνιος, ), meaning &quot;the Zeus of the underworld&quot;, by those avoiding his actual name, as he had complete control over the underworld.

==Mythology==
===Early years===
In Greek mythology, Hades, the god of the Greek underworld, was the first-born son of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. He had three older sisters, Hestia, Demeter, and Hera, as well as a younger brother, Poseidon, all of whom had been swallowed whole by their father as soon as they were born. Zeus was the youngest child and through the machinations of their mother, Rhea, he was the only one that had escaped this fate. Upon reaching adulthood, Zeus managed to force his father to disgorge his siblings. After their release, the six younger gods, along with allies they managed to gather, challenged the elder gods for power in the Titanomachy, a divine war. The war lasted for ten years and ended with the victory of the younger gods. Following their victory, according to a single famous passage in the &quot;Iliad&quot; (&quot;Book XV&quot;, ln.187–93), Hades and his two brothers, Poseidon and Zeus, drew lots for realms to rule. Zeus received the sky, Poseidon received the seas, and Hades received the underworld, the unseen realm to which the souls of the dead go upon leaving the world as well as any and all things beneath the earth.

Hades obtained his wife and queen, Persephone, through abduction at the behest of Zeus. This myth is the most important one Hades takes part in; it also connected the Eleusinian Mysteries with the Olympian pantheon, particularly as represented in the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Demeter&quot;, which is the oldest story of the abduction, most likely dating back to the beginning of the 6th century BC. Helios told the grieving Demeter that Hades was not an unworthy groom or son-in-law given his status among the gods, as her own brother and king on his own right:

===King of the underworld===
Despite modern connotations of death as evil, Hades was actually more altruistically inclined in mythology. Hades was portrayed as passive and never portrayed negatively; his role was often maintaining relative balance. That said, he was also depicted as cold and stern, and he held all of his subjects equally accountable to his laws. Any other individual aspects of his personality are not given, as Greeks refrained from giving him much thought to avoid attracting his attention.

Hades ruled the dead, assisted by others over whom he had complete authority. The House of Hades was described as full of &quot;guests,&quot; though he rarely left the underworld. He cared little about what happened in the world above, as his primary attention was ensuring none of his subjects ever left his domain.

He strictly forbade his subjects to leave his domain and would become quite enraged when anyone tried to leave, or if someone tried to steal the souls from his realm. His wrath was equally terrible for anyone who tried to cheat death or otherwise crossed him, as Sisyphus and Pirithous found out to their sorrow. While usually indifferent to his subjects, Hades was very focused on the punishment of these two people; particularly Pirithous, as he entered the underworld in an attempt to steal Persephone for himself, and consequently was forced onto the &quot;Chair of Forgetfulness&quot;. Another myth is about the Greek god Asclepius who was originally a demigod, son of Apollo and Coronis, a Thessalian princess. During his lifetime, he became a famous and talented physician, who eventually was able to bring the dead back to life. Feeling cheated, Hades persuaded Zeus to kill him with a thunderbolt. After his death, Asclepius was brought to Olympus where he became a god. Hades was only depicted outside of the underworld once in myth, and even that is believed to have been an instance where he had just left the gates of the underworld, which was when Heracles shot him with an arrow as Hades was attempting to defend the city of Pylos. After he was shot, however, he traveled to Olympus to heal. Besides Heracles, the only other living people who ventured to the underworld were also heroes: Odysseus, Aeneas (accompanied by the Sibyl), Orpheus, to whom Hades showed uncharacteristic mercy at Persephone&#x27;s urging, who was moved by Orpheus&#x27;s music, Theseus with Pirithous, and, in a late romance, Psyche. None of them were pleased with what they witnessed in the realm of the dead. In particular, the Greek war hero Achilles, whom Odysseus conjured with a blood libation, said:
===Abduction of Persephone===


The consort of Hades was Persephone, daughter of Zeus and Demeter. Persephone did not submit to Hades willingly, but was abducted by him while picking flowers in the fields of Nysa (her father, Zeus, had previously given Persephone to Hades, to be his wife, as is stated in the first lines of the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Demeter&quot;). In protest of his act, Demeter cast a curse on the land and there was a great famine; though, one by one, the gods came to request she lift it, lest mankind perish and cause the gods to be deprived of their receiving gifts and sacrifices, Demeter asserted that the earth would remain barren until she saw her daughter again. Zeus then sends for his son, Hermes, and instructs him to go down to the underworld in hopes that he may be able to convince Hades to allow Persephone to return to Earth, so that Demeter might see Persephone and cause the famine to stop. Hermes obeys and goes down to Hades&#x27;s realm, wherein he finds Hades seated upon a couch, Persephone seated next to him. Hermes relays Zeus&#x27;s message, and Hades complies, saying, 
Afterwards, Hades readies his chariot, but not before he secretly gives Persephone a pomegranate seed to eat; Hermes takes the reins, and he and Persephone make their way to the Earth above, coming to a halt in front of Demeter&#x27;s temple at Eleusis, where the goddess has been waiting. Demeter and Persephone run towards each other and embrace one another, happy that they are reunited. Demeter, however, suspects that Persephone may have eaten food while down in the underworld, and so she questions Persephone, saying:

Persephone does admit that she ate the food of the dead, as she tells Demeter that Hades gave her a pomegranate seed and forced her to eat it. Persephone&#x27;s eating the pomegranate seed binds her to Hades and the underworld, much to the dismay of Demeter. Zeus, however, had previously proposed a compromise, to which all parties had agreed: of the year, Persephone would spend one third with her husband.

It is during this time, when Persephone is down in the underworld with her husband, that winter falls upon the earth, &quot;an aspect of sadness and mourning.&quot;

===Visitors in the underworld===
The hero Orpheus once descended into the underworld in search of his late wife Eurydice, who died when a snake bit her. So lovely was the music he played that it charmed even Hades (as well as his wife Persephone), who allowed him to take Eurydice to the land of the living, as long as he did not look back at her on his way out.

In another story, Theseus and Pirithous pledged to kidnap and marry daughters of Zeus. Theseus chose Helen and together they kidnapped her and decided to hold onto her until she was old enough to marry. Pirithous chose Persephone. They left Helen with Theseus&#x27;s mother, Aethra, and traveled to the underworld. Hades knew of their plan to capture his wife, so he pretended to offer them hospitality and set a feast; as soon as the pair sat down, snakes coiled around their feet and held them there. Theseus was eventually rescued by Heracles but Pirithous was either trapped as punishment for daring to seek the wife of a god for his own or killed by Cerberus, depending on the version of the story.
Sisyphus was a mortal king from Corinth who was punished in Tartarus for revealing to the river god Asopus the whereabouts of his daughter Aegina after Zeus abducted her, and for trying to cheat death as well. Zeus, angry at Sisyphus for revealing the secret, sent Thanatos to Sisyphus, but he cleverly cast Death into his own bonds, and as a result no one could die until Ares freed Thanatos and delivered Sisyphus to him. But still, Sisyphus ordered his wife Merope not to perform any funeral rites for him and what else was accustomed as tribute to the underworld gods before he was brought to Hades. After some time that Merope had not offered proper honours, Hades learnt of this, and allowed Sisyphus to return to the world of the living so that he could punish his wife, with the understanding that he would return afterwards. Sisyphus, however, never returned as promised until years later, when he died of old age. Hades punished Sisyphus by making him roll a boulder up a hill in the underworld; but every time he reached the top, the boulder would roll down again and again. In another version, it is Persephone who lets him out.

Heracles&#x27;s final labour was to capture Cerberus. First, Heracles went to Eleusis to be initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries. He did this to absolve himself of guilt for killing the centaurs and to learn how to enter and exit the underworld alive. He found the entrance to the underworld at Taenarum. Athena and Hermes helped him through and back from Hades. Heracles asked Hades for permission to take Cerberus. Hades agreed as long as Heracles did not harm Cerberus. When Heracles dragged the dog out of Hades, he passed through the cavern Acherusia.
In the myth of Admetus and Alcestis, after Alcestis chose to die in place of her husband Admetus in order to save him, Heracles brought her back from the dead by fighting and defeating Hades. In other versions, like Euripides&#x27;s play &quot;Alcestis&quot;, Heracles fought Thanatos instead. At another time, Heracles sieged the town of Pylos and during the fight he wounded Hades, who had sided with the Pylians. In great pain, Hades went to Olympus to be healed by the physician of the gods, Paean.

===Lovers of Hades===
Leuce was the most beautiful of the nymphs and a daughter of Oceanus. Hades fell in love with her and abducted her to the underworld. She lived out the span of her life in his realm, and when she died, the god sought consolation by creating a suitable memorial of their love: in the Elysian Fields where the pious spend their afterlife, he brought a white tree into existence. It was this tree with which Heracles crowned himself to celebrate his return from the underworld.

Minthe was a nymph of the river Cocytus who became Hades&#x27;s mistress. A jealous Persephone trampled the nymph under her foot, transforming her into garden mint in the process. According to a scholiast on Nicander, Hades turned his dead lover into the mint herb after Persephone tore her into pieces for sleeping with him. In another version, Hades had kept Minthe as his mistress before he married Persephone, and set her aside afterwards. Minthe boasted of being more beautiful than Persephone, and that Hades would soon take her back. In anger over the hubris directed toward her daughter, Demeter trampled Minthe and turned her into mint.

Theophile was a girl who claimed that Hades loved her and that she was better than Persephone.

===Other works===
Once, when a plague hit Aonia, a region in Boeotia, the people consulted an oracle, and the god replied to them that they needed to make an appeal to the gods of the Underworld and sacrifice two willing young maidens to appease the anger of Hades and Persephone. The girls that were chosen were Menippe and Metioche, the daughters of Orion, who solemnly offered their lives in order to save their countrymen. After invoking the chthonic deities three times, they took their own lives with the shuttles of their looms. Hades and Persephone then took pity in both of them, and transformed their corpses into comets.

In some versions Hades is considered the master of the goddesses of Fate, not his brother Zeus and the god who designates the end and origin of all things and orders the alternation of birth and destruction, the arbiter of life and death. This relationship is very clear in Roman epics like Statius&#x27;s &quot;Thebaid&quot;, where they are mentioned taking souls to be judged by Hades and inflicting severe punishments or in Claudian&#x27;s &quot;De raptu Proserpinae&quot; where they appear begging their master not to release the Titans and saying everything they do is for him, after Hades threatens Zeus to release the Titans against him if he does not give him a wife.

Hades is considered the father of the Furies in some versions, but the mother&#x27;s identity varies. in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; their mother is the night goddess Nyx and in the &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot; their mother is Persephone by Hades. One of the rare occasions when he appears interacting with them is in Statius&#x27;s &quot;Thebaid&quot;, when Hades orders Tisiphone to punish humans for having invaded the underworld. He is said to hate Alecto, even though she is one of his children.

In contrast to many of his other classical representations the satirical author Lucian of Samosata presents Hades in a more positive and even comic way. In his &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot;, he is represented trying to solve problems of some famous mythological figures and one of the most outstanding dialogues is with Protesilaus, one of the Greek heroes killed in the Trojan War. In this conversation Protesilaus asks him to be reunited with his (still living) lover, and brings up as example that Hades did the same for Admetus and Alcestis, Orpheus and Eurydice, and that he himself also knows what being in love is like. Hades is skeptical, but Persephone manages to persuade him.

According to Hesiod, when the monstrous Typhon attacked the Olympian gods, Hades is said to have trembled in fear in the underworld while Zeus fought Typhon above.

In one of Plato&#x27;s dialogues, Socrates talks about Hades as a figure capable of making everyone fall by his enchantments and that is why no one ever leaves the underworld, including the sirens.

==Cult and epithets==
Hades, as the god of the dead, was a fearsome figure to those still living; in no hurry to meet him, they were reluctant to swear oaths in his name, and averted their faces when sacrificing to him. Since to many, simply to say the word &quot;Hades&quot; was frightening, euphemisms were pressed into use. Since precious minerals come from under the earth (i.e., the &quot;underworld&quot; ruled by Hades), he was considered to have control of these as well, and as such the Greeks referred to him as Πλούτων (Greek &quot;Plouton&quot;; Latin PLVTO, &quot;Pluto&quot;, &quot;the rich one&quot;). This title is derived from the word &quot;Ploutos&quot; (, ). Sophocles explained the notion of referring to Hades as &quot;Plouton&quot; with these words: &quot;the gloomy Hades enriches himself with our sighs and our tears.&quot; In addition, he was called Clymenus (, &quot;Klýmenos&quot;, &#x27; infamous&#x27;, ), Polydegmon (, &quot;Polydégmon&quot;, &#x27;host of many&#x27;, ), and perhaps Eubuleus (, &quot;Eubouleús&quot;, &#x27;good counsel&#x27;, ), all of them euphemisms for a name that was unsafe to pronounce, which evolved into epithets.

He spent most of the time in his dark realm. Formidable in battle, he proved his ferocity in the famous Titanomachy, the battle of the Olympians versus the Titans, which established the rule of Zeus.

Feared and loathed, Hades embodied the inexorable finality of death: &quot;Why do we loathe Hades more than any god, if not because he is so adamantine and unyielding?&quot; The rhetorical question is Agamemnon&#x27;s. Hades was not, however, an evil god, for although he was stern, cruel, and unpitying, he was still just. Hades ruled the underworld and was therefore most often associated with death and feared by men, but he was not Death itself — it is Thanatos, son of Nyx and Erebus, who is the actual personification of death, although Euripides&#x27;s play &quot;Alkestis&quot; states fairly clearly that Thanatos and Hades were one and the same deity, and gives an interesting description of Hades as being dark-cloaked and winged; moreover, Hades was also referred to as &quot;Hesperos Theos&quot; (&quot;god of death &amp; darkness&quot;).

When the Greeks propitiated Hades, they banged their hands on the ground to be sure he would hear them. Black animals, such as sheep, were sacrificed to him. While some suggest the very vehemence of the rejection of human sacrifice expressed in myth might imply an unspoken memory of some distant past, there is no direct evidence of such a turn. The blood from all chthonic sacrifices including those to propitiate Hades dripped into a pit or cleft in the ground. The person who offered the sacrifice had to avert his face.

One ancient source says that he possessed the Cap of invisibility. His chariot, drawn by four black horses, made for a fearsome and impressive sight. These beasts were variously named as, according to Claudian: Orphnaeus, Aethon, Nycteus and Alastor while other authors listed also: Nonius, Ametheus, Abastor, Abetor and Metheus. His other ordinary attributes were the narcissus and cypress plants, the Key of Hades and Cerberus, the three-headed dog. In certain portraits, snakes also appeared to be attributed to Hades as he was occasionally portrayed to be either holding them or accompanied by them. This is believed to hold significance as in certain classical sources Hades ravished Kore in the guise of a snake, who went on to give birth to Zagreus-Dionysus. While bearing the name &#x27;Zeus&#x27;, Zeus Olympios, the great king of the gods, noticeably differs from the Zeus Meilichios, a decidedly chthonian character, often portrayed as a snake, and as seen beforehand, they cannot be different manifestations of the same god, in fact whenever &#x27;another Zeus&#x27; is mentioned, this always refers to Hades. Zeus Meilichios and Zeus Eubouleus are often referred to as being alternate names for Hades.

The philosopher Heraclitus, unifying opposites, declared that Hades and Dionysus, the very essence of indestructible life &quot;(zoë)&quot;, are the same god. Among other evidence, Karl Kerényi notes in his book that the Homeric Hymn To Demeter, votive marble images and epithets all link Hades to being Dionysus. He also notes that the grieving goddess Demeter refused to drink wine, as she states that it would be against &quot;themis&quot; for her to drink wine, which is the gift of Dionysus, after Persephone&#x27;s abduction, because of this association; indicating that Hades may in fact have been a &quot;cover name&quot; for the underworld Dionysus. He suggests that this dual identity may have been familiar to those who came into contact with the Mysteries. Dionysus also shared several epithets with Hades such as &quot;Chthonios&quot; (&quot;the subterranean&quot;),&quot;Eubouleus&quot; (&quot;Good Counselor&quot;), and &quot;Euclius&quot; (&quot;glorious&quot; or &quot;renowned&quot;) .
Evidence for a cult connection is quite extensive, particularly in southern Italy, especially when considering the death symbolism included in Dionysian worship; statues of Dionysus found in the Ploutonion at Eleusis gives further evidence as the statue bears a striking resemblance to the statue of Eubouleus also known as the youthful depiction of the Lord of the underworld. The statue of Eubouleus is described as being radiant but disclosing a strange inner darkness.

Both Hades and Dionysus were associated with a divine tripartite deity with Zeus. The Orphics in particular believed that Zeus and Hades were the same deity and portrayed them as such. This nature and aspect of Hades and Zeus displayed in the Orphic stories is the explanation for why both Hades and Zeus are considered to be the father of Orphic Dionysus-Zagreus. Orphics also described Zagreus as the son of Hades, while also regarding Zagreus as an aspect of Dionysus. The role of unifying Hades, Zeus and Dionysus as a single tripartite god was used to represent the birth, death and resurrection of a deity and to unify the &#x27;shining&#x27; realm of Zeus and the dark realm of Hades that lay beneath the Earth.

Among the other appellations under which Hades or Pluto is generally known, are the following:

&quot;In Greek:&quot;

*Adesius, his name in Latium. It is expressive of &quot;the grace&quot;.
*Agelastus, from his &quot;melancholy&quot; countenance.
*Agesilaus, expressive of his &quot;attracting&quot; all &quot;people&quot; to his empire.
*Agetes or Hegetes, a name assigned to him by Pindar, as to one who &quot;conducts&quot;.
*Aidoneus, as used by Plutarch in a euhemerised version of the story of Pirithous&#x27;s failed abduction of Persephone in which the god is recast as a king of the Molossians.
*Axiocersus, or the &quot;shorn god&quot;, a name of Pluto in the mysteries of the Cabiri: he was there represented as &quot;without hair&quot;.
*Iao, his name at Clares, a town of Ionia.
*Moiragetes, his name as &quot;guide&quot; of &quot;the Fates&quot;.
*Ophieus, his name as the &quot;blind god&quot; among the Messenians: it was derived from their dedicating certain Augurs to him, whom they deprived of sight at the moment of their birth.

&quot;In Latin or Etruscan:&quot;

*Altor, from &quot;alo&quot;, to nourish.
*Februus, from &quot;Februa&quot;, signifying the sacrifices and purifications adopted in funeral rites.
*Feralis Deus, the &quot;dismal&quot; or &quot;cruel&quot; god.
*Lactum, his name among the Sarmatians.
*Larthy Tytiral, &quot;sovereign of Tartarus&quot;, his name in Etruria.
*Mantus or Manus, the diminutive of &quot;Summanus&quot;, an Etruscan epithet.
*Niger Deus, &quot;black god&quot;, his epithet as god of the Infernal Regions.
*Opertus, the &quot;concealed&quot;.
*Postulio, a name assigned to him by Varro, under which he was worshipped on the shores of the lake Curtius, from the circumstance of the earth&#x27;s having opened at that spot, and of the Aruspices having presumed that the King of Death thus asked for (&quot;postula&quot;, I ask,) sacrifices.
*Profundus Jupiter, &quot;deep&quot; or &quot;lower Jove&quot;, from his being sovereign of the &quot;deep&quot;, or &quot;infernal&quot; regions.
*Quietalis, from &quot;quies&quot;, rest.
*Rusor, because all things &quot;return&quot; eventually to the earth.
*Salutaris Divus, a name assigned to him when he restored the dead to life. Whenever the gods wished to re-animate a body, Pluto let fail some drops of nectar from his urn upon the favoured person: this may account for bis being sometimes represented with an inverted vase.
*Saturnius, from his father &quot;Saturn.&quot;
*Soranus, his name among the Sabines, in the temple dedicated to him on Mount Soracte.
*Stygius, from the river Styx.
*Summanus, from &quot;summus manium&quot;, prince of the dead.
*Tellumo, a name derived from those treasures which Pluto possesses in the recesses of the earth. Tellumo denotes (according to Varro) the &quot;creative&quot; power of the earth, in opposition to Tellus the &quot;productive&quot;.
*Uragus, expressive of bis power over &quot;fire&quot;.
*Urgus, from &quot;urgeo&quot;, to impel.

&quot;In Egypt:&quot;

*Amenthes, a name of Pluto among the Egyptians. Plutarch informs us, that the word &quot;Amenthes&quot; has a reference to the doctrines of the metempsychosis, and signifies the &quot;place which gives and receives&quot;;&#x27; on the belief that some vast gulf was assigned as a receptacle to the souls, which were about to animate new bodies.

==Artistic representations==

Hades was depicted infrequently in artwork, as well as mythology, because the Greeks were so afraid of him. His artistic representations, which are generally found in Archaic pottery, are not even concretely thought of as the deity; however at this point in time it is heavily believed that the figures illustrated are indeed Hades. He was later presented in the classical arts in the depictions of the Rape of Persephone. Within these illustrations, Hades was often young, yet he was also shown as varying ages in other works. Due to this lack of depictions, there were not very strict guidelines when representing the deity. On pottery, he has a dark beard and is presented as a stately figure on an &quot;ebony throne.&quot; His attributes in art include a bident (less commonly, a scepter), a helm, cornucopias, roosters, and a key. They key plays a doubly symbolic role in that it represents his control over the underworld and acts as a reminder that the gates of the underworld were always locked so that souls could not leave. Even if the doors were open, Cerberus, the three-headed guard dog of the underworld, ensured that, while all souls were allowed to enter into the underworld freely, none could ever escape. Cerberus is a very integral symbol of Hades so much so that when Cerberus is depicted, the depiction very rarely portrays him without Hades. Sometimes, artists painted Hades as looking away from the other gods, as he was disliked by them as well as humans.

As Pluto, he was regarded in a more positive light. He holds a cornucopia, representing the gifts he bestows upon people as well as fertility, which he becomes connected to. 

==Realm of Hades==
In older Greek myths, the realm of Hades is the misty and gloomy abode of the dead (also called Erebus) where all mortals go when they die. Very few mortals could leave Hades once they entered. The exceptions, Heracles and Theseus, are heroic. Even Odysseus in his &quot;Nekyia&quot; (&quot;Odyssey&quot;, xi) calls up the spirits of the departed, rather than descend to them. Later Greek philosophy introduced the idea that all mortals are judged after death and are either rewarded or cursed.

There were several sections of the realm of Hades, including Elysium, the Asphodel Meadows, and Tartarus. The mythographer Apollodorus, describes Tartarus as &quot;a gloomy place in Hades as far distant from Earth, as Earth is distant from the sky.&quot; Greek mythographers were not perfectly consistent about the geography of the afterlife. A contrasting myth of the afterlife concerns the Garden of the Hesperides, often identified with the Isles of the Blessed, where the blessed heroes may dwell.

In Roman mythology, the entrance to the underworld located at Avernus, a crater near Cumae, was the route Aeneas used to descend to the realm of the dead. By synecdoche, &quot;Avernus&quot; could be substituted for the underworld as a whole. The &quot;di inferi&quot; were a collective of underworld divinities.

For Hellenes, the deceased entered the underworld by crossing the Styx, ferried across by Charon (kair&#x27;-on), who charged an &quot;obolus,&quot; a small coin for passage placed in the mouth of the deceased by pious relatives. Paupers and the friendless gathered for a hundred years on the near shore according to Book VI of Vergil&#x27;s Aeneid. Greeks offered propitiatory libations to prevent the deceased from returning to the upper world to &quot;haunt&quot; those who had not given them a proper burial. The far side of the river was guarded by Cerberus, the three-headed dog defeated by Heracles (Roman Hercules). Passing beyond Cerberus, the shades of the departed entered the land of the dead to be judged.

The five rivers of the realm of Hades, and their symbolic meanings, are Acheron (the river of sorrow, or woe), Cocytus (lamentation), Phlegethon (fire), Lethe (oblivion), and Styx (hate), the river upon which even the gods swore and in which Achilles was dipped to render him invincible. The Styx forms the boundary between the upper and lower worlds. See also Eridanos.

The first region of Hades comprises the Fields of Asphodel, described in &quot;Odyssey&quot; xi, where the shades of heroes wander despondently among lesser spirits, who twitter around them like bats. Only libations of blood offered to them in the world of the living can reawaken in them for a time the sensations of humanity.

Beyond lay Erebus, which could be taken for a euphonym of Hades, whose own name was dread. There were two pools, that of Lethe, where the common souls flocked to erase all memory, and the pool of Mnemosyne (&quot;memory&quot;), where the initiates of the Mysteries drank instead. In the forecourt of the palace of Hades and Persephone sit the three judges of the underworld: Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Aeacus. There at the sacred to Hecate, where three roads meet, souls are judged, returned to the Fields of Asphodel if they are neither virtuous nor evil, sent by the road to Tartarus if they are impious or evil, or sent to Elysium (Islands of the Blessed) with the &quot;blameless&quot; heroes.

In the Sibylline oracles, a curious hodgepodge of Greco-Roman and Judaeo-Christian elements, Hades again appears as the abode of the dead, and by way of folk etymology, it even derives &quot;Hades&quot; from the name Adam (the first man), saying it is because he was the first to enter there. Owing to its appearance in the New Testament of the Bible, Hades also has a distinct meaning in Christianity.

<doc id="13236" wikidata="Q48464" url="?curid=13236" title="GNU Hurd">
<text>GNU Hurd is a collection of microkernel servers written as part of GNU, for the GNU Mach microkernel. It has been under development since 1990 by the GNU Project of the Free Software Foundation, designed as a replacement for the Unix kernel, and released as free software under the GNU General Public License. When the Linux kernel proved to be a viable solution, development of GNU Hurd slowed, at times alternating between stasis and renewed activity and interest.

The Hurd&#x27;s design consists of a set of protocols and server processes (or daemons, in Unix terminology) that run on the GNU Mach microkernel. The Hurd aims to surpass the Unix kernel in functionality, security, and stability, while remaining largely compatible with it. The GNU Project chose the multiserver microkernel for the operating system, due to perceived advantages over the traditional Unix monolithic kernel architecture, a view that had been advocated by some developers in the 1980s.

== Name and logo ==
In December 1991 the primary architect of the Hurd described the name as a mutually recursive acronym:
As both &quot;hurd&quot; and &quot;hird&quot; are homophones of the English word &quot;herd&quot;, the full name &quot;GNU Hurd&quot; is also a play on the words &quot;herd of gnus&quot;, reflecting how the kernel works.

The logo is called the &quot;Hurd boxes&quot; and it also reflects on architecture. The logo is a graph where nodes represent the Hurd kernel&#x27;s servers and directed edges are IPC messages.

== Development history ==
Richard Stallman founded the GNU Project in September 1983 with an aim to create a free GNU operating system. Initially the components required for kernel development were written: editors, shell, compiler, debugger etc. By 1989, the GPL came into being and the only major component missing was the kernel.

Development on the Hurd began in 1990 after an abandoned kernel attempt in 1986, based on the research TRIX operating system developed by Professor Steve Ward and his group at MIT&#x27;s Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS). According to Thomas Bushnell, the initial Hurd architect, their early plan was to adapt the 4.4BSD-Lite kernel and, in hindsight, &quot;It is now perfectly obvious to me that this would have succeeded splendidly and the world would be a very different place today.&quot; In 1987 Richard Stallman proposed using the Mach microkernel developed by Richard Rashid at Carnegie Mellon University. Work on this was delayed for three years due to uncertainty over whether CMU would release the Mach code under a suitable license.

With the release of the Linux kernel in 1991, the primary user of GNU&#x27;s userland components soon became operating systems based on the Linux kernel (Linux distributions), prompting the coining of the term &quot;GNU/Linux&quot;.

Development of the Hurd has proceeded slowly. Despite an optimistic announcement by Stallman in 2002 predicting a release of GNU/Hurd later that year, the Hurd is still not considered suitable for production environments. Development in general has not met expectations, and there are still a significant number of bugs and missing features. This has resulted in a poorer product than many, including Stallman, had expected. In 2010, after twenty years under development, Stallman said that he was &quot;not very optimistic about the GNU Hurd. It makes some progress, but to be really superior it would require solving a lot of deep problems&quot;, but added that &quot;finishing it is not crucial&quot; for the GNU system because a free kernel already existed (Linux), and completing Hurd would not address the main remaining problem for a free operating system: device support.

The Debian project, among others, have worked on the Hurd project to produce binary distributions of Hurd-based GNU operating systems for IBM PC compatible systems.

After years of stagnation, development picked up again in 2015 and 2016, with four releases during these two years, but no more since then.

On August 20, 2015, amid the Google Summer of Code, it was announced that GNU Guix had been ported to GNU Hurd.

== Architecture ==
Unlike most Unix-like kernels, the Hurd uses a server–client architecture, built on a microkernel that is responsible for providing the most basic kernel services – coordinating access to the hardware: the CPU (through process management and scheduling), RAM (via memory management), and other various input/output devices (via I/O scheduling) for sound, graphics, mass storage, etc. In theory, the microkernel design would allow for all device drivers to be built as servers working in user space, but today most drivers of this kind are still contained in the GNU Mach kernel space.

According to Hurd developers, the main advantage of microkernel-based design is the ability to extend the system: developing a new module would not require in depth knowledge of the rest of the kernel, and a bug in one module would not crash the entire system. Hurd provides a concept of &quot;translators&quot;, a framework of modules used to extend a file system functionality.

From early on, the Hurd was developed to use GNU Mach as the microkernel. This was a technical decision made by Richard Stallman, who thought it would speed up the work by saving a large part of it. He has admitted that he was wrong about that. Other Unix-like systems working on the Mach microkernel include OSF/1, Lites, and MkLinux. macOS and NeXTSTEP use hybrid kernels based on Mach.

=== Other microkernels ===
From 2004 onward, various efforts were launched to port the Hurd to more modern microkernels. The L4 microkernel was the original choice in 2004, but progress slowed to a halt. Nevertheless, during 2005, Hurd developer Neal Walfield finished the initial memory management framework for the L4/Hurd port, and Marcus Brinkmann ported essential parts of glibc; namely, getting the process startup code working, allowing programs to run, thus allowing the first user programs (trivial ones such as the hello world program) in C to run.

Since 2005, Brinkmann and Walfield started researching Coyotos as a new kernel for HURD. In 2006, Brinkmann met with Jonathan Shapiro (a primary architect of the Coyotos Operating System) to aid in and discuss the use of the Coyotos kernel for GNU/Hurd. In further discussion HURD developers realised that Coyotos (as well as other similar kernels) are not suitable for HURD.

In 2007, Hurd developers Neal Walfield and Marcus Brinkmann gave a critique of the Hurd architecture, known as &quot;the critique&quot;, and a proposal for how a future system may be designed, known as &quot;the position paper&quot;. In 2008, Neal Walfield began working on the Viengoos microkernel as a modern native kernel for HURD. , development on Viengoos is paused due to Walfield lacking time to work on it.

In the meantime, others have continued working on the Mach variant of Hurd.

=== Unix extensions ===
A number of traditional Unix concepts are replaced or extended in the Hurd.

Under Unix, every running program has an associated user id, which normally corresponds to the user that started the process. This id largely dictates the actions permitted to the program. No outside process can change the user id of a running program. A Hurd process, on the other hand, runs under a &quot;set&quot; of user ids, which can contain multiple ids, one, or none. A sufficiently privileged process can add and remove ids to another process. For example, there is a password server that will hand out ids in return for a correct login password.

Regarding the file system, a suitable program can be designated as a &quot;translator&quot; for a single file or a whole directory hierarchy. Every access to the translated file, or files below a hierarchy in the second case, is in fact handled by the program. For example, a file translator may simply redirect read and write operations to another file, like a Unix symbolic link. The effect of Unix &quot;mounting&quot; is achieved by setting up a filesystem translator (using the &quot;settrans&quot; command). Translators can also be used to provide services to the user. For example, the ftpfs translator allows a user to encapsulate remote FTP sites within a directory. Then, standard tools such as ls, cp, and rm can be used to manipulate files on the remote system. Even more powerful translators are ones such as UnionFS, which allows a user to unify multiple directories into one; thus listing the unified directory reveals the contents of all the directories.

The Hurd requires a multiboot-compliant boot loader, such as GRUB.

=== Architecture of the servers ===
According to the Debian documentation, there are 24 servers (18 core servers and 6 file system servers) named as follows:

==== Core servers ====
* auth (authentication server): Receives requests and passwords from programs and gives them an ID, which changes the privileges of the program.
* crash (crash server): Handles all fatal errors.
* eieio (translation server): TODO
* exec (execution server): Translates an executable image (currently ELF and a.out are supported) to a runnable image in memory.
* fifo (FIFO translator): Implements named pipes.
* new-fifo (new FIFO server): An alternate server for named pipes.
* firmlink (the firmlink translator): Implements firmlinks ‒ &quot;half-way between a symbolic link and a hard link&quot;.
* fwd (forward server): Forwards requests to other servers, used by fifo and symlink servers.
* hostmux (host multiplexer server)
* ifsock (server for sockets interface): Helps with UNIX domain socket addresses.
* init (init server): Basic system booting and configuration.
* magic (magic server): Signals that a name lookup must be resolved internally by a process when the result involves the process&#x27;s state.
* null (null server): Implements /dev/null and /dev/zero.
* pfinet (pfinet server): Implements the PF_INET protocol family.
* pflocal (pflocal server): Implements UNIX domain sockets.
* proc (process server): Assigns PIDs and manages process-level actions.
* symlink (symbolic link translator): Implements symbolic links for filesystems that do not support them.
* term (terminal server): A POSIX terminal.
* usermux (user multiplexer server): Invokes user-specific translators.

==== Filesystem servers ====
;ext2fs
:The ext2 filesystem translator. It receives disk blocks from the microkernel and gives files and directories to the applications.
;isofs
:The translator for the ISO 9660 filesystem. Translates blocks of a CD or DVD to files and directories for the applications.
;nfs
:See Network File System.
;ftpfs
: File transfer protocol filesystem translator.
;storeio
:The storage translator.

The servers collectively implement the POSIX API, with each server implementing a part of the interface. For instance, the various filesystem servers each implement the filesystem calls. The storage server will work as a wrapping layer, similar to the block layer of Linux. The equivalent of VFS of Linux is achieved by libdiskfs and libpager libraries.

<text>In the classic era of the [[cinema of the United States]] (1930 – 1945) genres matured. Short time periods with a large amount of films consisting of a specific genre are known as &quot;cycles&quot;. While most would recognize many of the genres as Westerns, gangsters, musicals, etc., often the cycles were significantly more specific. Instead of &quot;romantic comedy&quot;, a cycle might be described as the &quot;Boy-meets-girl-boy-loses-girl-boy-gets-girl&quot; cycle.

<doc id="13250" wikidata="Q60603744" url="?curid=13250" title="Health care reform">
<text>Health care reform is for the most part governmental policy that affects health care delivery in a given place. Health care reform typically attempts to:
* Broaden the population that receives health care coverage through either public sector insurance programs or private sector insurance companies
* Expand the array of health care providers consumers may choose among
* Improve the access to health care specialists
* Improve the quality of health care
* Give more care to citizens
* Decrease the cost of health care

==Frameworks for health care reform==
While final performance goals are largely agreed upon, different frameworks suggest different intermediate goals, such as equity, productivity, safety, innovation, and choice.
=== Control knobs theory ===

In &quot;Getting Health Reform Right: A Guide to Improving Performance and Equity,&quot; Marc Roberts, William Hsiao, Peter Berman, and Michael Reich of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health aim to provide decision-makers with tools and frameworks for health care system reform. They propose five &quot;control knobs&quot; of health reform: financing, payment, organization, regulation, and behavior. These control knobs refer to the &quot;mechanisms and processes that reformers can adjust to improve system performance&quot;. The authors selected these control knobs as representative of the most important factors upon which a policymaker can act to determine health system outcomes.

Their method emphasizes the importance of &quot;identifying goals explicitly, diagnosing causes of poor performance systematically, and devising reforms that will produce real changes in performance&quot;. The authors view health care systems as a means to an end. Accordingly, the authors advocate for three intrinsic performance goals of the health system that can be adjusted through the control knobs. These goals include:
# &quot;Health status:&quot; This goal refers to the overall health of the target population, assessed by metrics such as life expectancy, disease burden, and/or the distribution of these across population subgroups.
# &quot;Customer satisfaction:&quot; This goal is concerned with the degree of satisfaction that the health care system produces among the target population.
# &quot;Financial risk protection:&quot; This goal refers to the health system&#x27;s ability to protect the target population from the financial burden of poor health or disease.
The authors also propose three intermediate performance measures, which are useful in determining the performance of system goals, but are not final objectives. These include:
# &quot;Efficiency:&quot;
## Technical efficiency: maximum output per unit cost
## Allocative efficiency: a given budget maximises health system user satisfaction or other defined goals
# &quot;Access:&quot; effective availability by which patients receive care
# &quot;Quality of care:&quot; consideration of both the average quality and distribution of quality

The five proposed control knobs represent the mechanisms and processes that policy-makers can use to design effective health care reforms. These control knobs are not only the most important elements of a healthcare system, but they also represent the aspect that can be deliberately adjusted by reforms to affect change. The five control knobs are:
# Financing, which encompasses all the mechanisms and activities designed to raise money for the health system. With respect to mechanisms, the financing knob includes health-related taxes, insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses among others. Activities refers to the institutional organization that collects and distributes finance to participants in the health sector. In other words, financing is about the resources available to the healthcare system, who controls them and who receives them. The financing knob has clear implications for the health status of the population and particular groups in it, as well as the access to health care and protection from financial risk that these groups, and the population as a whole, have. The financing knob involves numerous potential financing mechanisms and processes that should be selected in accordance with a country&#x27;s social values and politics.
# Payment refers to the mechanisms and processes through which the health system or patients distribute payments to providers, including fees, capitation and budgets on the part of the government and fees paid by patients. Payment is about the distribution of available resources to the providers of health services. Health care reform can implement a variety of incentive schemes for both providers and patients in a way to optimize limited resources.
# Organization of the health system refers to the structure of providers, their roles, activities and operations. Essentially, organization describes how the health care market is set up: who are the providers, who are the consumers, who are the competitors, and who runs them. Changes in the organization of a healthcare system happen at multiple levels at both the front-line and managerial level.
# Regulation refers to actions at the state level that modify or alter the behavior of various actors within the health care system. The actors may include health care providers, medical associations, individual consumers, insurance agents, and more. Regulations are only effective when enforced, therefore laws that are &quot;on the books&quot; but are not implemented in practice have little effect on the system as a whole.
# Behavior of healthcare actors includes actions of both providers (e.g., doctors&#x27; behavior) and patients (e.g., anti-smoking campaigns) and involves &quot;changing individual behavior through population-based interventions&quot;. Healthcare reform with respect to behavior revolves around the behaviors that can be used to improve the outcomes and performance of the health care system. These behaviors include health-seeking behavior, professional/doctors&#x27; behavior, treatment compliance, and lifestyle and prevention behaviors.

====Limitations====
The five control knobs of health care reform are not designed to work in isolation; health care reform may require the adjustment of more than one knob or of multiple knobs simultaneously. Further, there is no agreed-upon order of turning control knobs to achieve specific reforms or outcomes. Health care reform varies by setting and reforms from one context may not necessarily apply in another. The knobs interact with cultural and structural factors that are not illustrated within this framework, but which have an important effect on health care reform in a given context. Rather than a prescriptive proposal of recommendations, the framework allows users to adapt their analysis and actions based on cultural context and relevance of interventions.

==Reduction of health care fraud==

One key component to healthcare reform is the reduction of healthcare fraud and abuse. In the U.S. and the EU, it is estimated that as much as 10 percent of all healthcare transactions and expenditures may be fraudulent.

==Comparison between countries==
As evidenced by the large variety of different healthcare systems seen across the world, there are several different pathways that a country could take when thinking about reform. In comparison to the UK, physicians in Germany have more bargaining power through professional organizations (i.e., Medical association); this ability to negotiate affects reform efforts. Germany makes use of sickness funds, which citizens are obliged to join but are able to opt out if they have a very high income (Belien 87). The Netherlands used a similar system but the financial threshold for opting out was lower (Belien 89). The Swiss, on the other hand use more of a privately based health insurance system where citizens are risk-rated by age and sex, among other factors (Belien 90).

==By country==
===United States===

In the United States, the debate regarding health care reform includes questions of a right to health care, access, fairness, sustainability, quality and amounts spent by government. The mixed public-private health care system in the United States is the most expensive in the world, with health care costing more per person than in any other nation, and a greater portion of gross domestic product (GDP) is spent on it than in any other United Nations member state except for East Timor (Timor-Leste).

====Hawaii and Massachusetts====
Both Hawaii and Massachusetts have implemented some incremental reforms in health care, but neither state has complete coverage of its citizens. For example, data from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that 5% of Massachusetts and 8% of Hawaii residents are uninsured. To date, The U.S. Uniform Law Commission, sponsored by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws has not submitted a uniform act or model legislation regarding health care insurance or health care reform.

===United Kingdom===

Healthcare was reformed in 1948 after the Second World War, broadly along the lines of the 1942 Beveridge Report, with the creation of the National Health Service or NHS. It was originally established as part of a wider reform of social services and funded by a system of National Insurance, though receipt of healthcare was never contingent upon making contributions towards the National Insurance Fund. Private health care was not abolished but had to compete with the NHS. About 15% of all spending on health in the UK is still privately funded but this includes the patient contributions towards NHS provided prescription drugs, so private sector healthcare in the UK is quite small. As part of a wider reform of social provision it was originally thought that the focus would be as much about the prevention of ill-health as it was about curing disease. The NHS for example would distribute baby formula milk fortified with vitamins and minerals in an effort to improve the health of children born in the post war years as well as other supplements such as cod liver oil and malt. Many of the common childhood diseases such as measles, mumps, and chicken pox were mostly eradicated with a national program of vaccinations.

The NHS has been through many reforms since 1974. The Conservative Thatcher administrations attempted to bring competition into the NHS by developing a supplier/buyer role between hospitals as suppliers and health authorities as buyers. This necessitated the detailed costing of activities, something which the NHS had never had to do in such detail, and some felt was unnecessary. The Labour Party generally opposed these changes, although after the party became New Labour, the Blair government retained elements of competition and even extended it, allowing private health care providers to bid for NHS work. Some treatment and diagnostic centres are now run by private enterprise and funded under contract. However, the extent of this privatisation of NHS work is still small, though remains controversial. The administration committed more money to the NHS raising it to almost the same level of funding as the European average and as a result, there was large expansion and modernisation programme and waiting times improved.

The government of Gordon Brown proposed new reforms for care in England. One is to take the NHS back more towards health prevention by tackling issues that are known to cause long term ill health. The biggest of these is obesity and related diseases such as diabetes and cardio-vascular disease. The second reform is to make the NHS a more personal service, and it is negotiating with doctors to provide more services at times more convenient to the patient, such as in the evenings and at weekends. This personal service idea would introduce regular health check-ups so that the population is screened more regularly. Doctors will give more advice on ill-health prevention (for example encouraging and assisting patients to control their weight, diet, exercise more, cease smoking etc.) and so tackle problems before they become more serious. Waiting times, which fell considerably under Blair (median wait time is about 6 weeks for elective non-urgent surgery) are also in focus. A target was set from December 2008, to ensure that no person waits longer than 18 weeks from the date that a patient is referred to the hospital to the time of the operation or treatment. This 18-week period thus includes the time to arrange a first appointment, the time for any investigations or tests to determine the cause of the problem and how it should be treated. An NHS Constitution was published which lays out the legal rights of patients as well as promises (not legally enforceable) the NHS strives to keep in England.

===Germany===
Numerous healthcare reforms in Germany were legislative interventions to stabilise the public health insurance since 1983. 9 out of 10 citizens are publicly insured, only 8% privately. Health care in Germany, including its industry and all services, is one of the largest sectors of the German economy. The total expenditure in health economics of Germany was about 287.3 billion euro in 2010, equivalent to 11.6 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) this year and about 3,510 euro per capita. Direct inpatient and outpatient care equal just about a quarter of the entire expenditure - depending on the perspective. Expenditure on pharmaceutical drugs is almost twice the amount of those for the entire hospital sector. Pharmaceutical drug expenditure grew by an annual average of 4.1% between 2004 and 2010.

These developments have caused numerous healthcare reforms since the 1980s. An actual example of 2010 and 2011: First time since 2004 the drug expenditure fell from 30.2 billion euro in 2010, to 29.1 billion Euro in 2011, i. e. minus 1.1 billion Euro or minus 3.6%. That was caused by restructuring the Social Security Code: manufacturer discount 16% instead of 6%, price moratorium, increasing discount contracts, increasing discount by wholesale trade and pharmacies.

===The Netherlands===
The Netherlands has introduced a new system of health care insurance based on risk equalization through a risk equalization pool. In this way, a compulsory insurance package is available to all citizens at affordable cost without the need for the insured to be assessed for risk by the insurance company. Furthermore, health insurers are now willing to take on high risk individuals because they receive compensation for the higher risks.

A 2008 article in the journal Health Affairs suggested that the Dutch health system, which combines mandatory universal coverage with competing private health plans, could serve as a model for reform in the US.

===Russia===

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia embarked on a series of reforms intending to deliver better healthcare by compulsory medical insurance with privately owned providers in addition to the state run institutions. According to the OECD none of 1991-93 reforms worked out as planned and the reforms had in many respects made the system worse. Russia has more physicians, hospitals, and healthcare workers than almost any other country in the world on a per capita basis, but since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the health of the Russian population has declined considerably as a result of social, economic, and lifestyle changes. However, after Putin became president in 2000 there was significant growth in spending for public healthcare and in 2006 it exceed the pre-1991 level in real terms. Also life expectancy increased from 1991 to 1993 levels, infant mortality rate dropped from 18.1 in 1995 to 8.4 in 2008. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced a large-scale health care reform in 2011 and pledged to allocate more than 300 billion rubles ($10 billion) in the next few years to improve health care in the country.

===Taiwan===

Taiwan changed its healthcare system in 1995 to a National Health Insurance model similar to the US Medicare system for seniors. As a result, the 40% of Taiwanese people who had previously been uninsured are now covered. It is said to deliver universal coverage with free choice of doctors and hospitals and no waiting lists. Polls in 2005 are reported to have shown that 72.5% of Taiwanese are happy with the system, and when they are unhappy, it&#x27;s with the cost of premiums (equivalent to less than US$20 a month).

Employers and the self-employed are legally bound to pay National Health Insurance (NHI) premiums which are similar to social security contributions in other countries. However, the NHI is a pay-as-you-go system. The aim is for the premium income to pay costs. The system is also subsidized by a tobacco tax surcharge and contributions from the national lottery.

<text>Henry Mayhew (25 November 1812 – 25 July 1887) was an English journalist, playwright, and advocate of reform. He was one of the co-founders of the satirical magazine &quot;Punch&quot; in 1841, and was the magazine&#x27;s joint editor, with Mark Lemon, in its early days. He is also known for his work as a social researcher, publishing an extensive series of newspaper articles in the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; that was later compiled into the three-volume book &quot;London Labour and the London Poor&quot; (1851), a groundbreaking and influential survey of the city&#x27;s poor.

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born in London, the thirteenth of 17 children to Joshua Mayhew. He was educated at Westminster School before running away from his studies to the sea. He then served with the East India Company as a midshipman on a ship bound for Calcutta. He returned after several years, in 1829, becoming a trainee lawyer in Wales. He left this career to become a freelance journalist. He contributed to &quot;The Thief&quot;, a readers&#x27; digest, followed quickly by founding a weekly comic journal – &quot;Figaro in London&quot; (1831–1839). Mayhew reputedly fled his creditors and holed up at the Erwood Inn, a small public house in the village of Erwood, south of Builth Wells in Wales.

===Paris and writing===
In 1835, Mayhew found himself in a state of debt and, along with a fellow writer, escaped to Paris to avoid his creditors. He spent his time writing and in the company of other writers including William Thackeray and Douglas Jerrold. Mayhew spent over 10 years in Paris, returning to England in the 1850s, whereupon he was involved in several literary adventures, mostly the writing of plays. Two of his plays – &quot;The&quot; &quot;Wandering Minstrel&quot; (1834) and &quot;But, However&quot; (1842) – were successful, whilst his early work &quot;Figaro in London&quot; was less successful.

===&quot;Punch&quot; magazine===

On 17 July 1841, Mayhew cofounded &quot;Punch &quot;magazine. At its founding, the magazine was jointly edited by Mayhew and Mark Lemon. The two men hired a group of writers and illustrators to aid them. These included Douglas Jerrold, Angus Reach, John Leech, Richard Doyle, and Shirley Brooks. Initially, the magazine was subtitled &quot;The London Charivari&quot;, referencing the satirical humour magazine published in France under the title &quot;Le Charivari&quot; (a work Mayhew read often whilst in Paris). Reflecting their satirical and humorous intent, the two editors took for their name and masthead the anarchic glove puppet Mr. Punch.

&quot;Punch&quot; was an unexpected success, selling about 6,000 copies a week in the early years. However, sales of as many as 10,000 issues a week were required to cover all costs of the magazine. In December 1842, the magazine was sold to Bradbury and Evans; Mayhew resigned as joint editor, and he continued at the magazine as &quot;suggestor in chief&quot; with Mark Lemon reappointed as editor. Mayhew eventually severed his connection with the magazine, writing his last article in February 1845. His brother Horace stayed on the board of Punch until his own death.

The &quot;Punch&quot; years gave Mayhew the opportunity to meet talented illustrators whom he later employed to work from daguerreotypes on &quot;London Labour and the London Poor&quot;. Following &quot;Punch&quot;, Mayhew launched &quot;Iron Times&quot;, a railway magazine. However, this venture lost Mayhew so much money that he was forced to appear in a court of bankruptcy in 1846.

===Formative work===
In 1842, Mayhew contributed to the pioneering &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;. By this time, he had become reasonably secure financially, had settled his debts, and married Jane Jerrold, the daughter of his friend Douglas Jerrold. She lived until 1880.

====&quot;London Labour and the London Poor&quot;====

The articles comprising &quot;London Labour and the London Poor&quot; were initially collected into three volumes in 1851; the 1861 edition included a fourth volume, co-written with Bracebridge Hemyng, John Binny, and Andrew Halliday, on the lives of prostitutes, thieves, and beggars. This extra volume took a more general and statistical approach to its subject than volumes one to three.

Mayhew wrote in volume one: &quot;I shall consider the whole of the metropolitan poor under three separate phases, according as they &quot;will&quot; work, they &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; work, and they &quot;won&#x27;t&quot; work&quot;. He interviewed everyone – beggars, street-entertainers (such as Punch and Judy men), market traders, prostitutes, labourers, sweatshop workers, even down to the &quot;mudlarks&quot; who searched the stinking mud on the banks of the River Thames for wood, metal, rope, and coal from passing ships, and the &quot;pure-finders&quot; who gathered dog faeces to sell to tanners. He described their clothes, how and where they lived, their entertainments and customs, and made detailed estimates of the numbers and incomes of those practising each trade. The books show how marginal and precarious many people&#x27;s lives were, in what, at that time, was the richest city in the world.

Mayhew&#x27;s richly detailed descriptions give an impression of what the street markets of his day were like. An example from volume one:

Some of the London street traders did not like the way Mayhew wrote about them. In spring/summer 1851, they established a Street Trader&#x27;s Protection Association to guard themselves against the journalist.

==Family==
Mayhew was the grandfather of Audrey Mayhew Allen (b. 1870), an author of a number of children&#x27;s stories published in various periodicals, and of &quot;Gladys in Grammarland&quot;, an imitation of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Wonderland&quot; books.

==Influence==
Mayhew&#x27;s work was embraced by and was an influence on the Christian Socialists, such as Thomas Hughes, Charles Kingsley, and F. D. Maurice. Radicals also published sizeable excerpts from the reports in the &quot;Northern Star&quot;, the &quot;Red Republican&quot;, and other newspapers. The often sympathetic investigations, with their immediacy and unswerving eye for detail, offered unprecedented insights into the condition of the Victorian poor. Alongside the earlier work of Edwin Chadwick, they are also speculated as a decisive influence on the thinking of Charles Dickens

Mayhew&#x27;s work inspired the script of director Christine Edzard&#x27;s 1990 film &quot;The Fool&quot;. Mayhew has appeared as a character in television and radio histories of Victorian London; he was played by Timothy West in the documentary &quot;London&quot; (2004), and David Haig in the Afternoon Play &quot;A Chaos of Wealth and Want&quot; (2010). In the 2012 novel &quot;Dodger&quot; by Terry Pratchett, Mayhew and his wife appear as fictionalised versions of themselves, and he is mentioned in the dedication.

==Publications, plays and public speeches: a select list ==
Although Mayhew is most remembered for his works of non-fiction, he also authored many plays, farces, novels, public speeches (many of which have been transcribed and subsequently published) alongside his numerous works of non-fiction and newspaper articles.

<doc id="13255" wikidata="Q556" url="?curid=13255" title="Hydrogen">
<text>Hydrogen is a chemical element; it has symbol H and atomic number 1. It is the lightest element and, at standard conditions, is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula , sometimes called dihydrogen, hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen, or simply hydrogen. It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Constituting about 75% of all normal matter, hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found in water, organic compounds, as the gas H2 (dihydrogen), and in other molecular forms. The most common isotope of hydrogen (protium, H) consists of one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.

In the early universe, the formation of hydrogen&#x27;s protons occurred in the first second after the Big Bang; neutral hydrogen atoms only formed about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch as the universe expanded and plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–81, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; hence its name means &quot;water-former&quot; in Greek. Understanding the colors of light absorbed and emitted by hydrogen was a crucial part of developing quantum mechanics.

Hydrogen, typically nonmetallic except under extreme pressure, readily forms covalent bonds with most nonmetals, contributing to the formation of compounds like water and various organic substances. Its role is crucial in acid-base reactions, which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of either a negatively charged anion, where it is known as hydride, or as a positively charged cation, H, called a proton. Although tightly bonded to water molecules, protons strongly affect the behavior of aqueous solutions, as reflected in the importance of pH. Hydride on the other hand, is rarely observed because it tends to deprotonate solvents, yielding H2.

Nearly all hydrogen production is done by transforming fossil fuels, particularly steam reforming of natural gas. It can also be produced from electricity by electrolysis, however this process is more expensive. Its main industrial uses include fossil fuel processing and ammonia production. Emerging uses for hydrogen include the use of fuel cells to generate electricity.
== Properties ==
=== Combustion ===

Hydrogen gas is highly flammable:
: (572 kJ/2 mol = 286 kJ/mol = 141.865 MJ/kg)
Enthalpy of combustion: −286 kJ/mol.

Hydrogen gas forms explosive mixtures with air in concentrations from 4–74% and with chlorine at 5–95%. The hydrogen autoignition temperature, the temperature of spontaneous ignition in air, is . In a high-pressure hydrogen leak, the shock wave from the leak itself can heat air to the autoignition temperature, leading to flaming and possibly explosion.

Hydrogen flames emit faint blue and ultraviolet light. Flame detectors are used to detect hydrogen fires as they are nearly invisible to the naked eye in daylight.

=== Electron energy levels ===
The ground state energy level of the electron in a hydrogen atom is −13.6 eV, equivalent to an ultraviolet photon of roughly 91 nm wavelength. The energy levels of hydrogen are referred to by consecutive quantum numbers, with formula_1 being the ground state. The hydrogen spectral series corresponds to emission of light due to transitions from higher to lower energy levels.

The energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the Bohr model of the atom, in which the electron &quot;orbits&quot; the proton, like how Earth orbits the Sun. However, the electron and proton are held together by electrostatic attraction, while planets and celestial objects are held by gravity. Due to the discretization of angular momentum postulated in early quantum mechanics by Bohr, the electron in the Bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton, and therefore only certain allowed energies.

An accurate description of the hydrogen atom comes from a quantum analysis that uses the Schrödinger equation, Dirac equation or Feynman path integral formulation to calculate the probability density of the electron around the proton. The most complex formulas include the small effects of special relativity and vacuum polarization. In the quantum mechanical treatment, the electron in a ground state hydrogen atom has no angular momentum—illustrating how the &quot;planetary orbit&quot; differs from electron motion.

=== Spin isomers ===

Molecular exists as two nuclear isomers that differ in the spin states of their nuclei. In the orthohydrogen form, the spins of the two nuclei are parallel, forming a spin triplet state having a total molecular spin formula_2; in the parahydrogen form the spins are antiparallel and form a spin singlet state having spin formula_3. The equilibrium ratio of ortho- to para-hydrogen depends on temperature. At room temperature or warmer, equilibrium hydrogen gas contains about 25% of the para form and 75% of the ortho form. The ortho form is an excited state, having higher energy than the para form by 1.455 kJ/mol, and it converts to the para form over the course of several minutes when cooled to low temperature. The thermal properties of these isomers differ because each has distinct rotational quantum states.

The ortho-to-para ratio in is an important consideration in the liquefaction and storage of liquid hydrogen: the conversion from ortho to para is exothermic and produces sufficient heat to evaporate most of the liquid if not converted first to parahydrogen during the cooling process. Catalysts for the ortho-para interconversion, such as ferric oxide and activated carbon compounds, are used during hydrogen cooling to avoid this loss of liquid.

=== Phases ===
Liquid hydrogen can exist at temperatures below hydrogen&#x27;s critical point of 33 K. However, for it to be in a fully liquid state at atmospheric pressure, H2 needs to be cooled to . Hydrogen was liquefied by James Dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention, the vacuum flask.

Solid hydrogen can be made at standard pressure, by decreasing the temperature below hydrogen&#x27;s melting point of . It was collected for the first time by James Dewar in 1899. Multiple distinct solid phases exist, known as Phase I through Phase V, each exhibiting a characteristic molecular arrangement. Liquid and solid phases can exist in combination at the triple point, a substance known as slush hydrogen.

Metallic hydrogen, a phase obtained at extremely high pressures (in excess of ), is an electrical conductor. It is believed to exist deep within giant planets like Jupiter.

When ionized, hydrogen becomes a plasma. This is the form in which hydrogen exists within stars.

=== Isotopes ===


Hydrogen has three naturally occurring isotopes, denoted , and . Other, highly unstable nuclei ( to ) have been synthesized in the laboratory but not observed in nature.
* is the most common hydrogen isotope, with an abundance of &gt;99.98%. Because the nucleus of this isotope consists of only a single proton, it is given the descriptive but rarely used formal name &quot;protium&quot;. It is the only stable isotope with no neutrons; see diproton for a discussion of why others do not exist.
* , the other stable hydrogen isotope, is known as deuterium and contains one proton and one neutron in the nucleus. Nearly all deuterium in the universe is thought to have been produced at the time of the Big Bang, and has endured since then. Deuterium is not radioactive, and is not a significant toxicity hazard. Water enriched in molecules that include deuterium instead of normal hydrogen is called heavy water. Deuterium and its compounds are used as a non-radioactive label in chemical experiments and in solvents for -NMR spectroscopy. Heavy water is used as a neutron moderator and coolant for nuclear reactors. Deuterium is also a potential fuel for commercial nuclear fusion.
* is known as tritium and contains one proton and two neutrons in its nucleus. It is radioactive, decaying into helium-3 through beta decay with a half-life of 12.32 years. It is radioactive enough to be used in luminous paint to enhance the visibility of data displays, such as for painting the hands and dial-markers of watches. The watch glass prevents the small amount of radiation from escaping the case. Small amounts of tritium are produced naturally by cosmic rays striking atmospheric gases; tritium has also been released in nuclear weapons tests. It is used in nuclear fusion, as a tracer in isotope geochemistry, and in specialized self-powered lighting devices. Tritium has also been used in chemical and biological labeling experiments as a radiolabel.

Unique among the elements, distinct names are assigned to its isotopes in common use. During the early study of radioactivity, heavy radioisotopes were given their own names, but these are mostly no longer used. The symbols D and T (instead of and ) are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium, but the symbol P was already used for phosphorus and thus was not available for protium. In its nomenclatural guidelines, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) allows any of D, T, , and to be used, though and are preferred.

The exotic atom muonium (symbol Mu), composed of an antimuon and an electron, can also be considered a light radioisotope of hydrogen. Because muons decay with lifetime , muonium is too unstable for observable chemistry. Nevertheless, muonium compounds are important test cases for quantum simulation, due to the mass difference between the antimuon and the proton, and IUPAC nomenclature incorporates such hypothetical compounds as muonium chloride (MuCl) and sodium muonide (NaMu), analogous to hydrogen chloride and sodium hydride respectively.

Antihydrogen () is the antimatter counterpart to hydrogen. It consists of an antiproton with a positron. Antihydrogen is the only type of antimatter atom to have been produced .

== History ==
=== 18th century ===

In 1671, Irish scientist Robert Boyle discovered and described the reaction between iron filings and dilute acids, which results in the production of hydrogen gas.
Boyle did not note that the gas was inflammable, but hydrogen would play a key role in overturning the phlogiston theory of combustion.

In 1766, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance, by naming the gas from a metal-acid reaction &quot;inflammable air&quot;. He speculated that &quot;inflammable air&quot; was in fact identical to the hypothetical substance &quot;phlogiston&quot; and further finding in 1781 that the gas produces water when burned. He is usually given credit for the discovery of hydrogen as an element.
In 1783, Antoine Lavoisier identified the element that came to be known as hydrogen when he and Laplace reproduced Cavendish&#x27;s finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned. Lavoisier produced hydrogen for his experiments on mass conservation by treating metallic iron with a steam of H2 through an incandescent iron tube heated in a fire. Anaerobic oxidation of iron by the protons of water at high temperature can be schematically represented by the set of following reactions:
:1) 

:2) 

:3) 

Many metals react similarly with water leading to the production of hydrogen. In some situations, this H2-producing process is problematic as is the case of zirconium cladding on nuclear fuel rods.

===19th century===

By 1806 hydrogen was used to fill balloons.
François Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine, an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806. Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The Döbereiner&#x27;s lamp and limelight were invented in 1823.Hydrogen was liquefied for the first time by James Dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention, the vacuum flask. He produced solid hydrogen the next year.

One of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed (but not understood at the time) was James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s observation that the specific heat capacity of unaccountably departs from that of a diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.

===20th century===
The existence of the hydride anion was suggested by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1916 for group 1 and 2 salt-like compounds. In 1920, Moers electrolyzed molten lithium hydride (LiH), producing a stoichiometric quantity of hydrogen at the anode.
Because of its simple atomic structure, consisting only of a proton and an electron, the hydrogen atom, together with the spectrum of light produced from it or absorbed by it, has been central to the development of the theory of atomic structure. Hydrogen&#x27;s unique position as the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be directly solved, has significantly contributed to the understanding of quantum mechanics through the exploration of its energetics. Furthermore, study of the corresponding simplicity of the hydrogen molecule and the corresponding cation  brought understanding of the nature of the chemical bond, which followed shortly after the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom had been developed in the mid-1920s.

==== Hydrogen-lifted airship ====

Because is only 7% the density of air, it was once widely used as a lifting gas in balloons and airships. The first hydrogen-filled balloon was invented by Jacques Charles in 1783. Hydrogen provided the lift for the first reliable form of air-travel following the 1852 invention of the first hydrogen-lifted airship by Henri Giffard. German count Ferdinand von Zeppelin promoted the idea of rigid airships lifted by hydrogen that later were called Zeppelins; the first of which had its maiden flight in 1900. Regularly scheduled flights started in 1910 and by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, they had carried 35,000 passengers without a serious incident. Hydrogen-lifted airships were used as observation platforms and bombers during the war.

The first non-stop transatlantic crossing was made by the British airship &quot;R34&quot; in 1919. Regular passenger service resumed in the 1920s and the discovery of helium reserves in the United States promised increased safety, but the U.S. government refused to sell the gas for this purpose. Therefore, hydrogen was used in the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; airship, which caught fire over New Jersey on 6 May 1937. The hydrogen that filled the airship was ignited, possibly by static electricity, and burst into flames. The visible flames in the photographs of the disaster were the result of the airship skin burning. Following the Hindenberg disaster, commercial hydrogen airship travel ceased. Hydrogen is still used, in preference to non-flammable but more expensive helium, as a lifting gas for weather balloons.

==== Deuterium and tritium ====
Deuterium was discovered in December 1931 by Harold Urey, and tritium was prepared in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck. Heavy water, which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey&#x27;s group in 1932.

==== Hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator ====
The first hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator went into service using gaseous hydrogen as a coolant in the rotor and the stator in 1937 at Dayton, Ohio, owned by the Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. This was justified by the high thermal conductivity and very low viscosity of hydrogen gas, thus lower drag than air. This is the most common coolant used for generators 60 MW and larger; smaller generators are usually air-cooled.

==== Nickel–hydrogen battery ====
The nickel–hydrogen battery was used for the first time in 1977 aboard the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Navigation technology satellite-2 (NTS-2). The International Space Station, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Global Surveyor are equipped with nickel-hydrogen batteries. In the dark part of its orbit, the Hubble Space Telescope is also powered by nickel-hydrogen batteries, which were finally replaced in May 2009, more than 19 years after launch and 13 years beyond their design life.

==Chemistry==
===Laboratory syntheses===
 is produced in labs, often as a by-product of other reactions. Many metals react with water to produce , but the rate of hydrogen evolution depends on the metal, the pH, and the presence of alloying agents. Most often, hydrogen evolution is induced by acids. The alkali and alkaline earth metals, aluminium, zinc, manganese, and iron react readily with aqueous acids. This reaction is the basis of the Kipp&#x27;s apparatus, which once was used as a laboratory gas source:

In the absence of acid, the evolution of is slower. Because iron is widely used structural material, its anaerobic corrosion is of technological significance:

Many metals, such as aluminium, are slow to react with water because they form passivated oxide coatings of oxides. An alloy of aluminium and gallium, however, does react with water. At high pH, aluminium can produce :

===Reactions of H2===
 is relatively unreactive. The thermodynamic basis of this low reactivity is the very strong H–H bond, with a bond dissociation energy of 435.7 kJ/mol. It does form coordination complexes called dihydrogen complexes. These species provide insights into the early steps in the interactions of hydrogen with metal catalysts. According to neutron diffraction, the metal and two H atoms form a triangle in these complexes. The H-H bond remains intact but is elongated. They are acidic.

Although exotic on Earth, the ion is common in the universe. It is a triangular species, like the aforementioned dihydrogen complexes. It is known as protonated molecular hydrogen or the trihydrogen cation.

Hydrogen directly reacts with chlorine, fluorine and bromine to give HF, HCl, and HBr, respectively. The conversion involves a radical chain mechanism. With heating, H2 reacts efficiently with the alkali and alkaline earth metals to give the saline hydrides of the formula MH and MH2, respectively. One of the striking properties of H2 is its inertness toward unsaturated organic compounds, such as alkenes and alkynes. These species only react with H2 in the presence of catalysts. Especially active catalysts are the platinum metals (platinum, rhodium, palladium, etc.). A major driver for the mining of these rare and expensive elements is their use as catalysts.

===Hydrogen-containing compounds===

Most known compounds contain hydrogen, not as H2, but as covalently bonded H atoms. This interaction is the basis of organic chemistry and biochemistry.Hydrogen forms many compounds with carbon, called the hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are called organic compounds. In nature, they almost always contain &quot;heteroatoms&quot; such as nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. The study of their properties is known as organic chemistry and their study in the context of living organisms is called biochemistry. By some definitions, &quot;organic&quot; compounds are only required to contain carbon. However, most of them also contain hydrogen, and because it is the carbon-hydrogen bond that gives this class of compounds most of its particular chemical characteristics, carbon-hydrogen bonds are required in some definitions of the word &quot;organic&quot; in chemistry. Millions of hydrocarbons are known, and they are usually formed by complicated pathways that seldom involve elemental hydrogen.

=== Hydrides ===
Hydrogen forms compounds with less electronegative elements, such as metals and main group elements. In these compounds, hydrogen takes on a partial negative charge. The term &quot;hydride&quot; suggests that the H atom has acquired a negative or anionic character, denoted . Usually hydride refers to hydrogen in a compound with a more electropositive element. For hydrides other than group 1 and 2 metals, the term can be misleading, considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen. A well known hydride is lithium aluminium hydride, the anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the Al(III). Perhaps the most extensive series of hydrides are the boranes, compounds consisting only of boron and hydrogen.

Hydrides can bond to these electropositive elements not only as a terminal ligand but also as bridging ligands. In diborane (), four H&#x27;s are terminal and two bridge between the two B atoms.

===Protons and acids ===

When bonded to a more electronegative element, particularly fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen, hydrogen can participate in a form of medium-strength noncovalent bonding with another electronegative element with a lone pair, a phenomenon called hydrogen bonding that is critical to the stability of many biological molecules. 
 can also be obtained by oxidation of H2. Under the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, acids are proton donors, while bases are proton acceptors.

A bare proton, essentially cannot exist in anything other than a vacuum. Otherwise it attaches to other atoms, ions, or molecules. Even species as inert as methane can be protonated. The term &#x27;proton&#x27; is used loosely and metaphorically to refer to refer to solvated &quot; without any implication that any single protons exist freely as a species. To avoid the implication of the naked proton in solution, acidic aqueous solutions are sometimes considered to contain the &quot;hydronium ion&quot; () or still more accurately, . Other oxonium ions are found when water is in acidic solution with other solvents.

==Occurrence==
===Cosmic===

Hydrogen, as atomic H, is the most abundant chemical element in the universe, making up 75% of normal matter by mass and &gt;90% by number of atoms. In astrophysics, neutral hydrogen in the interstellar medium is called &quot;H I&quot; and ionized hydrogen is called &quot;H II&quot;. Radiation from stars ionizes H I to H II, creating spheres of ionized H II around stars. In the chronology of the universe neutral hydrogen dominated until the birth of stars during the era of reionization led to bubbles of ionized hydrogen that grew and merged over 500 million of years.
They are the source of the 21-cm hydrogen line at 1420 MHz that is detected in order to probe primordial hydrogen. The large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped Lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the universe up to a redshift of &quot;z&quot; = 4.

Hydrogen is found in great abundance in stars and gas giant planets. Molecular clouds of are associated with star formation. Hydrogen plays a vital role in powering stars through the proton-proton reaction in lower-mass stars, and through the CNO cycle of nuclear fusion in case of stars more massive than the Sun.

Hydrogen plasma states have properties quite distinct from those of molecular or atomic hydrogen. As a plasma, hydrogen&#x27;s electron and proton are not bound together, resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity (producing the light from the Sun and other stars). The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind they interact with the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora.

A molecular form called protonated molecular hydrogen () is found in the interstellar medium, where it is generated by ionization of molecular hydrogen from cosmic rays. This ion has also been observed in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter. The ion is long-lived in outer space due to the low temperature and density. is one of the most abundant ions in the universe, and it plays a notable role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium. Neutral triatomic hydrogen can exist only in an excited form and is unstable. By contrast, the positive hydrogen molecular ion () is a rare in the universe.

===Terrestrial===
Hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the Earth&#x27;s surface, mostly in the form of chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water. Elemental hydrogen is normally in the form of a gas, . It is present in a very low concentration in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere (around 0.53 ppm on a molar basis) because of its light weight, which enables it to escape the atmosphere more rapidly than heavier gases. Despite its low concentration in our atmosphere, terrestrial hydrogen is sufficiently abundant to support the metabolism of several bacteria.

Large underground deposits of hydrogen gas have been discovered in several countries including Mali, France and Australia. As of 2024, it is uncertain how much underground hydrogen can be extracted economically.

== Production and storage==
===Industrial routes===
Nearly all of the world&#x27;s current supply of hydrogen gas () is created from fossil fuels. Many methods exist for producing H2, but three dominate commercially: steam reforming often coupled to water-gas shift, partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, and water electrolysis.

====Steam reforming====

Hydrogen is mainly produced by steam methane reforming (SMR), the reaction of water and methane. Thus, at high temperature (1000–1400 K, 700–1100 °C or 1300–2000 °F), steam (water vapor) reacts with methane to yield carbon monoxide and .
Producing one tonne of hydrogen through this process emits 6.6–9.3 tonnes of carbon dioxide. The production of natural gas feedstock also produces emissions such as vented and fugitive methane, which further contributes to the overall carbon footprint of hydrogen.

This reaction is favored at low pressures, Nonetheless, conducted at high pressures (2.0 MPa, 20 atm or 600 inHg) because high-pressure is the most marketable product, and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) purification systems work better at higher pressures. The product mixture is known as &quot;synthesis gas&quot; because it is often used directly for the production of methanol and many other compounds. Hydrocarbons other than methane can be used to produce synthesis gas with varying product ratios. One of the many complications to this highly optimized technology is the formation of coke or carbon:

Therefore, steam reforming typically employs an excess of . Additional hydrogen can be recovered from the steam by using carbon monoxide through the water gas shift reaction (WGS). This process requires an iron oxide catalyst:

Hydrogen is sometimes produced and consumed in the same industrial process, without being separated. In the Haber process for ammonia production, hydrogen is generated from natural gas.

====Partial oxidation of hydrocarbons====
Other methods for CO and production include partial oxidation of hydrocarbons:

Although less important commercially, coal can serve as a prelude to the shift reaction above:

Olefin production units may produce substantial quantities of byproduct hydrogen particularly from cracking light feedstocks like ethane or propane.

====Water electrolysis ====

Electrolysis of water is a conceptually simple method of producing hydrogen. 
Commercial electrolyzers use nickel-based catalysts in strongly alkaline solution. Platinum is a better catalyst but is expensive. The hydrogen created through electrolysis using renewable energy is commonly referred to as &quot;green hydrogen&quot;.

Electrolysis of brine to yield chlorine also produces high purity hydrogen as a co-product, which is used for a variety of transformations such as hydrogenations.

The electrolysis process is more expensive than producing hydrogen from methane without carbon capture and storage.

Innovation in hydrogen electrolyzers could make large-scale production of hydrogen from electricity more cost-competitive.

==== Methane pyrolysis ====

Hydrogen can be produced by pyrolysis of natural gas (methane), producing hydrogen gas and solid carbon with the aid a catalyst and 74 kJ/mol input heat:
: (ΔH° = 74 kJ/mol)
The carbon may be sold as a manufacturing feedstock or fuel, or landfilled.
This route could have a lower carbon footprint than existing hydrogen production processes, but mechanisms for removing the carbon and preventing it from reacting with the catalyst remain obstacles for industrial scale use.

==== Thermochemical ====
Water splitting is the process by which water is decomposed into its components. Relevant to the biological scenario is this simple equation:
The reaction occurs in the light reactions in all photosynthetic organisms. A few organisms, including the alga &quot;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&quot; and cyanobacteria, have evolved a second step in the dark reactions in which protons and electrons are reduced to form gas by specialized hydrogenases in the chloroplast.

Efforts have been undertaken to genetically modify cyanobacterial hydrogenases to more efficiently generate gas even in the presence of oxygen. Efforts have also been undertaken with genetically modified alga in a bioreactor.

Relevant to the thermal water-splitting scenario is this simple equation:
More than 200 thermochemical cycles can be used for water splitting. Many of these cycles such as the iron oxide cycle, cerium(IV) oxide–cerium(III) oxide cycle, zinc zinc-oxide cycle, sulfur-iodine cycle, copper-chlorine cycle and hybrid sulfur cycle have been evaluated for their commercial potential to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water and heat without using electricity. A number of labs (including in France, Germany, Greece, Japan, and the United States) are developing thermochemical methods to produce hydrogen from solar energy and water.

===Natural routes===
====Biohydrogen====

 is produced by enzymes called hydrogenases. This process allows the host organism to use fermentation as a source of energy. These same enzymes also can oxidize H2, such that the host organisms can subsist by reducing oxidized substrates using electrons extracted from H2.

The hydrogenase enzyme feature iron or nickel-iron centers at their active sites. The natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the hydrogen cycle.

Some bacteria such as &quot;Mycobacterium smegmatis&quot; can use the small amount of hydrogen in the atmosphere as a source of energy when other sources are lacking. Their hydrogenase are designed with small channels that exclude oxygen and so permits the reaction to occur even though the hydrogen concentration is very low and the oxygen concentration is as in normal air.

Confirming the existence of hydrogenases in the human gut, occurs in human breath. The concentration in the breath of fasting people at rest is typically less than 5 parts per million (ppm) but can be 50 ppm when people with intestinal disorders consume molecules they cannot absorb during diagnostic hydrogen breath tests.

====Serpentinization====
Serpentinization is a geological mechanism that produce highly reducing conditions. Under these conditions, water is capable of oxidizing ferrous () ions in fayalite. The process is of interest because it generates hydrogen gas:

Closely related to this geological process is the Schikorr reaction:
This process also is relevant to the corrosion of iron and steel in oxygen-free groundwater and in reducing soils below the water table.

===Storage===
If H2 is to used as an energy source, its storage is important. It dissolves only poorly in solvents. For example, at room temperature and 0.1 Mpascal, ca. 0.05 moles dissolves in one kilogram of diethyl ether. The H2 can be stored in compressed form, although compressing costs energy. Liquifaction is impractical given its low critical temperature. In contrast, ammonia and many hydrocarbons can be liquified at room temperature under pressure. For these reasons, hydrogen &quot;carriers&quot; - materials that reversibly bind H2 - have attracted much attention. The key question is then the weight percent of H2-equivalents within the carrier material. For example, hydrogen can be reversibly absorbed into many rare earth and transition metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice. These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks, but the gas&#x27;s high solubility is also a metallurgical problem, contributing to the embrittlement of many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.

The most problematic aspect of metal hydrides for storage is their modest H2 content, often on the order of 1%. For this reason, there is interest in storage of H2 in compounds of low molecular weight. For example, ammonia borane () contains 19.8 weight percent of H2. The problem with this material is that after release of H2, the resulting boron nitride does not re-add H2, i.e. ammonia borane is an irreversible hydrogen carrier. More attractive, somewhat ironically, are hydrocarbons such as tetrahydroquinoline, which reversibly release some H2 when heated in the presence of a catalyst:

== Applications ==


=== Petrochemical industry ===
Large quantities of are used in the &quot;upgrading&quot; of fossil fuels. Key consumers of include hydrodesulfurization, and hydrocracking. Many of these reactions can be classified as hydrogenolysis, i.e., the cleavage of bonds by hydrogen. Illustrative is the separation of sulfur from liquid fossil fuels:

=== Hydrogenation ===
Hydrogenation, the addition of to various substrates, is done on a large scale. Hydrogenation of to produce ammonia by the Haber process, consumes a few percent of the energy budget in the entire industry. The resulting ammonia is used to supply most of the protein consumed by humans. Hydrogenation is used to convert unsaturated fats and oils to saturated fats and oils. The major application is the production of margarine. Methanol is produced by hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. It is similarly the source of hydrogen in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid. is also used as a reducing agent for the conversion of some ores to the metals.

=== Coolant ===

Hydrogen is commonly used in power stations as a coolant in generators due to a number of favorable properties that are a direct result of its light diatomic molecules. These include low density, low viscosity, and the highest specific heat and thermal conductivity of all gases.

=== Fuel ===
The potential for using hydrogen (H2) as a fuel has been widely discussed. Hydrogen can be used in fuel cells to produce electricity, or burned to generate heat. When hydrogen is consumed in fuel cells, the only emission at the point of use is water vapour. When burned, hydrogen produces relatively little pollution at the point of combustion, but can lead to thermal formation of harmful nitrogen oxides.

If hydrogen is produced with low or zero greenhouse gas emissions (green hydrogen), it can play a significant role in decarbonizing energy systems where there are challenges and limitations to replacing fossil fuels with direct use of electricity.

Hydrogen fuel can produce the intense heat required for industrial production of steel, cement, glass, and chemicals, thus contributing to the decarbonisation of industry alongside other technologies, such as electric arc furnaces for steelmaking. However, it is likely to play a larger role in providing industrial feedstock for cleaner production of ammonia and organic chemicals. For example, in steelmaking, hydrogen could function as a clean fuel and also as a low-carbon catalyst, replacing coal-derived coke (carbon):
:::vs
Hydrogen used to decarbonise transportation is likely to find its largest applications in shipping, aviation and, to a lesser extent, heavy goods vehicles, through the use of hydrogen-derived synthetic fuels such as ammonia and methanol and fuel cell technology. For light-duty vehicles including cars, hydrogen is far behind other alternative fuel vehicles, especially compared with the rate of adoption of battery electric vehicles, and may not play a significant role in future.

Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen together serve as cryogenic propellants in liquid-propellant rockets, as in the Space Shuttle main engines. NASA has investigated the use of rocket propellant made from atomic hydrogen, boron or carbon that is frozen into solid molecular hydrogen particles suspended in liquid helium. Upon warming, the mixture vaporizes to allow the atomic species to recombine, heating the mixture to high temperature.

Hydrogen produced when there is a surplus of variable renewable electricity could in principle be stored and later used to generate heat or to re-generate electricity. It can be further transformed into synthetic fuels such as ammonia and methanol. Disadvantages of hydrogen fuel include high costs of storage and distribution due to hydrogen&#x27;s explosivity, its large volume compared to other fuels, and its tendency to make pipes brittle.

=== Semiconductor industry ===
Hydrogen is employed to saturate broken (&quot;dangling&quot;) bonds of amorphous silicon and amorphous carbon that helps stabilizing material properties. It is also a potential electron donor in various oxide materials, including ZnO, , CdO, MgO, , , , , , , , , , , , and .

=== Niche and evolving uses ===
*Shielding gas: Hydrogen is used as a shielding gas in welding methods such as atomic hydrogen welding.

*Cryogenic research: Liquid is used in cryogenic research, including superconductivity studies.
*Leak detection: Pure or mixed with nitrogen (sometimes called forming gas), hydrogen is a tracer gas for detection of minute leaks. Applications can be found in the automotive, chemical, power generation, aerospace, and telecommunications industries. Hydrogen is an authorized food additive (E 949) that allows food package leak testing, as well as having anti-oxidizing properties.

*Neutron moderation: Deuterium (hydrogen-2) is used in nuclear fission applications as a moderator to slow neutrons.
*Nuclear fusion fuel: Deuterium is used in nuclear fusion reactions.
*Isotopic labeling: Deuterium compounds have applications in chemistry and biology in studies of isotope effects on reaction rates.

*Tritium uses: Tritium (hydrogen-3), produced in nuclear reactors, is used in the production of hydrogen bombs, as an isotopic label in the biosciences, and as a source of beta radiation in radioluminescent paint for instrument dials and emergency signage.

== Safety and precautions ==
In hydrogen pipelines and steel storage vessels, hydrogen molecules are prone to react with metals, causing hydrogen embrittlement and leaks in the pipeline or storage vessel. Since it is lighter than air, hydrogen does not easily accumulate to form a combustible gas mixture. However, even without ignition sources, high-pressure hydrogen leakage may cause spontaneous combustion and detonation.

Hydrogen is flammable when mixed even in small amounts with air. Ignition can occur at a volumetric ratio of hydrogen to air as low as 4%. In approximately 70% of hydrogen ignition accidents, the ignition source cannot be found, and it is widely believed by scholars that spontaneous ignition of hydrogen occurs.

Hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot, is almost invisible, and thus can lead to accidental burns. Hydrogen is non-toxic, but like most gases it can cause asphyxiation in the absence of adequate ventilation.

<doc id="13256" wikidata="Q560" url="?curid=13256" title="Helium">
<text>Helium (from ) is a chemical element; it has symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas and the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements, and it does not have a melting point at standard pressures. It is the second-lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe, after hydrogen. It is present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this in both the Sun and Jupiter, because of the very high nuclear binding energy (per nucleon) of helium-4, with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. The most common isotope of helium in the universe is helium-4, the vast majority of which was formed during the Big Bang. Large amounts of new helium are created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.

Helium was first detected as an unknown, yellow spectral line signature in sunlight during a solar eclipse in 1868 by Georges Rayet, Captain C. T. Haig, Norman R. Pogson, and Lieutenant John Herschel, and was subsequently confirmed by French astronomer Jules Janssen. Janssen is often jointly credited with detecting the element, along with Norman Lockyer. Janssen recorded the helium spectral line during the solar eclipse of 1868, while Lockyer observed it from Britain. However, only Lockyer proposed that the line was due to a new element, which he named after the Sun. The formal discovery of the element was made in 1895 by chemists Sir William Ramsay, Per Teodor Cleve, and Nils Abraham Langlet, who found helium emanating from the uranium ore cleveite, which is now not regarded as a separate mineral species, but as a variety of uraninite. In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in natural gas fields in parts of the United States, by far the largest supplier of the gas today.

Liquid helium is used in cryogenics (its largest single use, consuming about a quarter of production), and in the cooling of superconducting magnets, with its main commercial application in MRI scanners. Helium&#x27;s other industrial uses—as a pressurizing and purge gas, as a protective atmosphere for arc welding, and in processes such as growing crystals to make silicon wafers—account for half of the gas produced. A small but well-known use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships. As with any gas whose density differs from that of air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 (helium I and helium II) is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics (in particular the property of superfluidity) and to those looking at the phenomena, such as superconductivity, produced in matter near absolute zero.

On Earth, it is relatively rare—5.2 ppm by volume in the atmosphere. Most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation. Terrestrial helium is a non-renewable resource because once released into the atmosphere, it promptly escapes into space. Its supply is thought to be rapidly diminishing. However, some studies suggest that helium produced deep in the Earth by radioactive decay can collect in natural gas reserves in larger-than-expected quantities, in some cases having been released by volcanic activity.

==History==

===Scientific discoveries===
The first evidence of helium was observed on August 18, 1868, as a bright yellow line with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun. The line was detected by French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India. This line was initially assumed to be sodium. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer Norman Lockyer observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which he named the D3 because it was near the known D1 and D2 Fraunhofer lines of sodium. He concluded that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth. Lockyer named the element with the Greek word for the Sun, ἥλιος (&quot;helios&quot;). It is sometimes said that English chemist Edward Frankland was also involved in the naming, but this is unlikely as he doubted the existence of this new element. The ending &quot;-ium&quot; is unusual, as it normally applies only to metallic elements; probably Lockyer, being an astronomer, was unaware of the chemical conventions.

In 1881, Italian physicist Luigi Palmieri detected helium on Earth for the first time through its D3 spectral line, when he analyzed a material that had been sublimated during a recent eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

On March 26, 1895, Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay isolated helium on Earth by treating the mineral cleveite (a variety of uraninite with at least 10% rare-earth elements) with mineral acids. Ramsay was looking for argon but, after separating nitrogen and oxygen from the gas, liberated by sulfuric acid, he noticed a bright yellow line that matched the D3 line observed in the spectrum of the Sun. These samples were identified as helium by Lockyer and British physicist William Crookes. It was independently isolated from cleveite in the same year by chemists Per Teodor Cleve and Abraham Langlet in Uppsala, Sweden, who collected enough of the gas to accurately determine its atomic weight. Helium was also isolated by American geochemist William Francis Hillebrand prior to Ramsay&#x27;s discovery, when he noticed unusual spectral lines while testing a sample of the mineral uraninite. Hillebrand, however, attributed the lines to nitrogen. His letter of congratulations to Ramsay offers an interesting case of discovery, and near-discovery, in science.

In 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds demonstrated that alpha particles are helium nuclei by allowing the particles to penetrate the thin glass wall of an evacuated tube, then creating a discharge in the tube, to study the spectrum of the new gas inside. In 1908, helium was first liquefied by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling the gas to less than . He tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed, because helium does not solidify at atmospheric pressure. Onnes&#x27; student Willem Hendrik Keesom was eventually able to solidify 1 cm3 of helium in 1926 by applying additional external pressure.

In 1913, Niels Bohr published his &quot;trilogy&quot; on atomic structure that included a reconsideration of the Pickering–Fowler series as central evidence in support of his model of the atom. This series is named for Edward Charles Pickering, who in 1896 published observations of previously unknown lines in the spectrum of the star ζ Puppis (these are now known to occur with Wolf–Rayet and other hot stars). Pickering attributed the observation (lines at 4551, 5411, and 10123 Å) to a new form of hydrogen with half-integer transition levels. In 1912, Alfred Fowler managed to produce similar lines from a hydrogen-helium mixture, and supported Pickering&#x27;s conclusion as to their origin. Bohr&#x27;s model does not allow for half-integer transitions (nor does quantum mechanics) and Bohr concluded that Pickering and Fowler were wrong, and instead assigned these spectral lines to ionised helium, He+. Fowler was initially skeptical but was ultimately convinced that Bohr was correct, and by 1915 &quot;spectroscopists had transferred [the Pickering–Fowler series] definitively [from hydrogen] to helium.&quot; Bohr&#x27;s theoretical work on the Pickering series had demonstrated the need for &quot;a re-examination of problems that seemed already to have been solved within classical theories&quot; and provided important confirmation for his atomic theory.

In 1938, Russian physicist Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa discovered that helium-4 has almost no viscosity at temperatures near absolute zero, a phenomenon now called superfluidity. This phenomenon is related to Bose–Einstein condensation. In 1972, the same phenomenon was observed in helium-3, but at temperatures much closer to absolute zero, by American physicists Douglas D. Osheroff, David M. Lee, and Robert C. Richardson. The phenomenon in helium-3 is thought to be related to pairing of helium-3 fermions to make bosons, in analogy to Cooper pairs of electrons producing superconductivity.

In 1961, Vignos and Fairbank reported the existence of a different phase of solid helium-4, designated the gamma-phase. It exists for a narrow range of pressure between 1.45 and 1.78 K.

===Extraction and use===
After an oil drilling operation in 1903 in Dexter, Kansas produced a gas geyser that would not burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected samples of the escaping gas and took them back to the University of Kansas at Lawrence where, with the help of chemists Hamilton Cady and David McFarland, he discovered that the gas consisted of, by volume, 72% nitrogen, 15% methane (a combustible percentage only with sufficient oxygen), 1% hydrogen, and 12% an unidentifiable gas. With further analysis, Cady and McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium. This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas.

Following a suggestion by Sir Richard Threlfall, the United States Navy sponsored three small experimental helium plants during World War I. The goal was to supply barrage balloons with the non-flammable, lighter-than-air gas. A total of of 92% helium was produced in the program even though less than a cubic meter of the gas had previously been obtained. Some of this gas was used in the world&#x27;s first helium-filled airship, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s C-class blimp C-7, which flew its maiden voyage from Hampton Roads, Virginia, to Bolling Field in Washington, D.C., on December 1, 1921, nearly two years before the Navy&#x27;s first &quot;rigid&quot; helium-filled airship, the Naval Aircraft Factory-built USS &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, flew in September 1923.

Although the extraction process using low-temperature gas liquefaction was not developed in time to be significant during World War I, production continued. Helium was primarily used as a lifting gas in lighter-than-air craft. During World War II, the demand increased for helium for lifting gas and for shielded arc welding. The helium mass spectrometer was also vital in the atomic bomb Manhattan Project.

The government of the United States set up the National Helium Reserve in 1925 at Amarillo, Texas, with the goal of supplying military airships in time of war and commercial airships in peacetime. Because of the Helium Act of 1925, which banned the export of scarce helium on which the US then had a production monopoly, together with the prohibitive cost of the gas, German Zeppelins were forced to use hydrogen as lifting gas, which would gain infamy in the Hindenburg disaster. The helium market after World War II was depressed but the reserve was expanded in the 1950s to ensure a supply of liquid helium as a coolant to create oxygen/hydrogen rocket fuel (among other uses) during the Space Race and Cold War. Helium use in the United States in 1965 was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption.

After the Helium Acts Amendments of 1960 (Public Law 86–777), the U.S. Bureau of Mines arranged for five private plants to recover helium from natural gas. For this helium conservation program, the Bureau built a pipeline from Bushton, Kansas, to connect those plants with the government&#x27;s partially depleted Cliffside gas field near Amarillo, Texas. This helium-nitrogen mixture was injected and stored in the Cliffside gas field until needed, at which time it was further purified.

By 1995, a billion cubic meters of the gas had been collected and the reserve was US$1.4 billion in debt, prompting the Congress of the United States in 1996 to discontinue the reserve. The resulting Helium Privatization Act of 1996 (Public Law 104–273) directed the United States Department of the Interior to empty the reserve, with sales starting by 2005.

Helium produced between 1930 and 1945 was about 98.3% pure (2% nitrogen), which was adequate for airships. In 1945, a small amount of 99.9% helium was produced for welding use. By 1949, commercial quantities of Grade A 99.95% helium were available.

For many years, the United States produced more than 90% of commercially usable helium in the world, while extraction plants in Canada, Poland, Russia, and other nations produced the remainder. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in Arzew, Algeria, producing began operation, with enough production to cover all of Europe&#x27;s demand. Meanwhile, by 2000, the consumption of helium within the U.S. had risen to more than 15 million kg per year. In 2004–2006, additional plants in Ras Laffan, Qatar, and Skikda, Algeria were built. Algeria quickly became the second leading producer of helium. Through this time, both helium consumption and the costs of producing helium increased. From 2002 to 2007 helium prices doubled.

, the United States National Helium Reserve accounted for 30 percent of the world&#x27;s helium. The reserve was expected to run out of helium in 2018. Despite that, a proposed bill in the United States Senate would allow the reserve to continue to sell the gas. Other large reserves were in the Hugoton in Kansas, United States, and nearby gas fields of Kansas and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. New helium plants were scheduled to open in 2012 in Qatar, Russia, and the US state of Wyoming, but they were not expected to ease the shortage.

In 2013, Qatar started up the world&#x27;s largest helium unit, although the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis severely affected helium production there. 2014 was widely acknowledged to be a year of over-supply in the helium business, following years of renowned shortages. Nasdaq reported (2015) that for Air Products, an international corporation that sells gases for industrial use, helium volumes remain under economic pressure due to feedstock supply constraints.

==Characteristics==

===Atom===

====In quantum mechanics====
In the perspective of quantum mechanics, helium is the second simplest atom to model, following the hydrogen atom. Helium is composed of two electrons in atomic orbitals surrounding a nucleus containing two protons and (usually) two neutrons. As in Newtonian mechanics, no system that consists of more than two particles can be solved with an exact analytical mathematical approach (see 3-body problem) and helium is no exception. Thus, numerical mathematical methods are required, even to solve the system of one nucleus and two electrons. Such computational chemistry methods have been used to create a quantum mechanical picture of helium electron binding which is accurate to within &lt; 2% of the correct value, in a few computational steps. Such models show that each electron in helium partly screens the nucleus from the other, so that the effective nuclear charge &quot;Z&quot;eff which each electron sees is about 1.69 units, not the 2 charges of a classic &quot;bare&quot; helium nucleus.

====Related stability of the helium-4 nucleus and electron shell====
The nucleus of the helium-4 atom is identical with an alpha particle. High-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point, exactly as does the charge density of helium&#x27;s own electron cloud. This symmetry reflects similar underlying physics: the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in helium&#x27;s nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium&#x27;s pair of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential), so that all these fermions fully occupy 1s orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and each cancelling the other&#x27;s intrinsic spin. This arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles and has astrophysical implications. Namely, adding another particle – proton, neutron, or alpha particle – would consume rather than release energy; all systems with mass number 5, as well as beryllium-8 (comprising two alpha particles), are unbound.

For example, the stability and low energy of the electron cloud state in helium accounts for the element&#x27;s chemical inertness, and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other, producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements. In a similar way, the particular energetic stability of the helium-4 nucleus, produced by similar effects, accounts for the ease of helium-4 production in atomic reactions that involve either heavy-particle emission or fusion. Some stable helium-3 (two protons and one neutron) is produced in fusion reactions from hydrogen, though its estimated abundance in the universe is about relative to helium-4.
The unusual stability of the helium-4 nucleus is also important cosmologically: it explains the fact that in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, as the &quot;soup&quot; of free protons and neutrons which had initially been created in about 6:1 ratio cooled to the point that nuclear binding was possible, almost all first compound atomic nuclei to form were helium-4 nuclei. Owing to the relatively tight binding of helium-4 nuclei, its production consumed nearly all of the free neutrons in a few minutes, before they could beta-decay, and thus few neutrons were available to form heavier atoms such as lithium, beryllium, or boron. Helium-4 nuclear binding per nucleon is stronger than in any of these elements (see nucleogenesis and binding energy) and thus, once helium had been formed, no energetic drive was available to make elements 3, 4 and 5. It is barely energetically favorable for helium to fuse into the next element with a lower energy per nucleon, carbon. However, due to the short lifetime of the intermediate beryllium-8, this process requires three helium nuclei striking each other nearly simultaneously (see triple-alpha process). There was thus no time for significant carbon to be formed in the few minutes after the Big Bang, before the early expanding universe cooled to the temperature and pressure point where helium fusion to carbon was no longer possible. This left the early universe with a very similar ratio of hydrogen/helium as is observed today (3 parts hydrogen to 1 part helium-4 by mass), with nearly all the neutrons in the universe trapped in helium-4.

All heavier elements (including those necessary for rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were hot enough to fuse helium itself. All elements other than hydrogen and helium today account for only 2% of the mass of atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, comprises about 24% of the mass of the universe&#x27;s ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.

===Gas and plasma phases===

Helium is the second least reactive noble gas after neon, and thus the second least reactive of all elements. It is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. Because of helium&#x27;s relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. For these reasons and the small size of helium monatomic molecules, helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.

Helium is the least water-soluble monatomic gas, and one of the least water-soluble of any gas (CF4, SF6, and C4F8 have lower mole fraction solubilities: 0.3802, 0.4394, and 0.2372 x2/10−5, respectively, versus helium&#x27;s 0.70797 x2/10−5), and helium&#x27;s index of refraction is closer to unity than that of any other gas. Helium has a negative Joule–Thomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand. Only below its Joule–Thomson inversion temperature (of about 32 to 50 K at 1 atmosphere) does it cool upon free expansion. Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling.

Most extraterrestrial helium is plasma in stars, with properties quite different from those of atomic helium. In a plasma, helium&#x27;s electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, even when the gas is only partially ionized. The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen, the particles interact with the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere, giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora.

===Liquid phase===


Helium liquifies when cooled below 4.2 K at atmospheric pressure. Unlike any other element, however, helium remains liquid down to a temperature of absolute zero. This is a direct effect of quantum mechanics: specifically, the zero point energy of the system is too high to allow freezing. Pressures above about 25 atmospheres are required to freeze it. There are two liquid phases: Helium I is a conventional liquid, and Helium II, which occurs at a lower temperature, is a superfluid.

====Helium I====
Below its boiling point of and above the lambda point of , the isotope helium-4 exists in a normal colorless liquid state, called &quot;helium I&quot;. Like other cryogenic liquids, helium I boils when it is heated and contracts when its temperature is lowered. Below the lambda point, however, helium does not boil, and it expands as the temperature is lowered further. 

Helium I has a gas-like index of refraction of 1.026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of Styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is. This colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K), which is only one-fourth the value expected from classical physics. Quantum mechanics is needed to explain this property and thus both states of liquid helium (helium I and helium II) are called &quot;quantum fluids&quot;, meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion (thermal energy) from masking the atomic properties.

====Helium II====

Liquid helium below its lambda point (called &quot;helium II&quot;) exhibits very unusual characteristics. Due to its high thermal conductivity, when it boils, it does not bubble but rather evaporates directly from its surface. Helium-3 also has a superfluid phase, but only at much lower temperatures; as a result, less is known about the properties of the isotope.
Helium II is a superfluid, a quantum mechanical state of matter with strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries as thin as 10 to 100 nm it has no measurable viscosity. However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity comparable to that of gaseous helium was observed. Existing theory explains this using the &quot;two-fluid model&quot; for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state, which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.

In the &quot;fountain effect&quot;, a chamber is constructed which is connected to a reservoir of helium II by a sintered disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which non-superfluid helium cannot pass. If the interior of the container is heated, the superfluid helium changes to non-superfluid helium. In order to maintain the equilibrium fraction of superfluid helium, superfluid helium leaks through and increases the pressure, causing liquid to fountain out of the container.

The thermal conductivity of helium II is greater than that of any other known substance, a million times that of helium I and several hundred times that of copper. This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat well have a valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. Helium II has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at 20 meters per second at 1.8 K through helium II as waves in a phenomenon known as &quot;second sound&quot;.

Helium II also exhibits a creeping effect. When a surface extends past the level of helium II, the helium II moves along the surface, against the force of gravity. Helium II will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates. It moves in a 30 nm-thick film regardless of surface material. This film is called a Rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin. As a result of this creeping behavior and helium II&#x27;s ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings, it is very difficult to confine. Unless the container is carefully constructed, the helium II will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer, where it will evaporate. Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, but rather than gravity, the restoring force is the van der Waals force. These waves are known as &quot;third sound&quot;.

===Solid phases===
Helium remains liquid down to absolute zero at atmospheric pressure, but it freezes at high pressure. Solid helium requires a temperature of 1–1.5 K (about −272 °C or −457 °F) at about 25 bar (2.5 MPa) of pressure. It is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index of the two phases are nearly the same. The solid has a sharp melting point and has a crystalline structure, but it is highly compressible; applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30%. With a bulk modulus of about 27 MPa it is ~100 times more compressible than water. Solid helium has a density of at 1.15 K and 66 atm; the projected density at 0 K and 25 bar (2.5 MPa) is . At higher temperatures, helium will solidify with sufficient pressure. At room temperature, this requires about 114,000 atm.

Helium-4 and helium-3 both form several crystalline solid phases, all requiring at least 25 bar. They both form an α phase, which has a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystal structure, a β phase, which is face-centered cubic (fcc), and a γ phase, which is body-centered cubic (bcc).

===Isotopes===

There are nine known isotopes of helium of which two, helium-3 and helium-4, are stable. In the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, one atom is for every million that are . Unlike most elements, helium&#x27;s isotopic abundance varies greatly by origin, due to the different formation processes. The most common isotope, helium-4, is produced on Earth by alpha decay of heavier radioactive elements; the alpha particles that emerge are fully ionized helium-4 nuclei. Helium-4 is an unusually stable nucleus because its nucleons are arranged into complete shells. It was also formed in enormous quantities during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

Helium-3 is present on Earth only in trace amounts. Most of it has been present since Earth&#x27;s formation, though some falls to Earth trapped in cosmic dust. Trace amounts are also produced by the beta decay of tritium. Rocks from the Earth&#x27;s crust have isotope ratios varying by as much as a factor of ten, and these ratios can be used to investigate the origin of rocks and the composition of the Earth&#x27;s mantle. is much more abundant in stars as a product of nuclear fusion. Thus in the interstellar medium, the proportion of to is about 100 times higher than on Earth. Extraplanetary material, such as lunar and asteroid regolith, have trace amounts of helium-3 from being bombarded by solar winds. The Moon&#x27;s surface contains helium-3 at concentrations on the order of 10 ppb, much higher than the approximately 5 ppt found in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. A number of people, starting with Gerald Kulcinski in 1986, have proposed to explore the Moon, mine lunar regolith, and use the helium-3 for fusion.

Liquid helium-4 can be cooled to about using evaporative cooling in a 1-K pot. Similar cooling of helium-3, which has a lower boiling point, can achieve about in a helium-3 refrigerator. Equal mixtures of liquid and below separate into two immiscible phases due to their dissimilarity (they follow different quantum statistics: helium-4 atoms are bosons while helium-3 atoms are fermions). Dilution refrigerators use this immiscibility to achieve temperatures of a few millikelvins.

It is possible to produce exotic helium isotopes, which rapidly decay into other substances. The shortest-lived heavy helium isotope is the unbound helium-10 with a half-life of . Helium-6 decays by emitting a beta particle and has a half-life of 0.8 second. Helium-7 and helium-8 are created in certain nuclear reactions. Helium-6 and helium-8 are known to exhibit a nuclear halo.

==Compounds==

Helium has a valence of zero and is chemically unreactive under all normal conditions. It is an electrical insulator unless ionized. As with the other noble gases, helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential. Helium can form unstable compounds, known as excimers, with tungsten, iodine, fluorine, sulfur, and phosphorus when it is subjected to a glow discharge, to electron bombardment, or reduced to plasma by other means. The molecular compounds HeNe, HgHe10, and WHe2, and the molecular ions , , , and have been created this way. HeH+ is also stable in its ground state but is extremely reactive—it is the strongest Brønsted acid known, and therefore can exist only in isolation, as it will protonate any molecule or counteranion it contacts. This technique has also produced the neutral molecule He2, which has a large number of band systems, and HgHe, which is apparently held together only by polarization forces.

Van der Waals compounds of helium can also be formed with cryogenic helium gas and atoms of some other substance, such as LiHe and He2.

Theoretically, other true compounds may be possible, such as helium fluorohydride (HHeF), which would be analogous to HArF, discovered in 2000. Calculations show that two new compounds containing a helium-oxygen bond could be stable. Two new molecular species, predicted using theory, CsFHeO and N(CH3)4FHeO, are derivatives of a metastable FHeO− anion first theorized in 2005 by a group from Taiwan.

Helium atoms have been inserted into the hollow carbon cage molecules (the fullerenes) by heating under high pressure. The endohedral fullerene molecules formed are stable at high temperatures. When chemical derivatives of these fullerenes are formed, the helium stays inside. If helium-3 is used, it can be readily observed by helium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Many fullerenes containing helium-3 have been reported. Although the helium atoms are not attached by covalent or ionic bonds, these substances have distinct properties and a definite composition, like all stoichiometric chemical compounds.

Under high pressures helium can form compounds with various other elements. Helium-nitrogen clathrate (He(N2)11) crystals have been grown at room temperature at pressures ca. 10 GPa in a diamond anvil cell. The insulating electride Na2He has been shown to be thermodynamically stable at pressures above 113 GPa. It has a fluorite structure.

==Occurrence and production==

===Natural abundance===
Although it is rare on Earth, helium is the second most abundant element in the known Universe, constituting 23% of its baryonic mass. Only hydrogen is more abundant. The vast majority of helium was formed by Big Bang nucleosynthesis one to three minutes after the Big Bang. As such, measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models. In stars, it is formed by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in proton–proton chain reactions and the CNO cycle, part of stellar nucleosynthesis.

In the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, the concentration of helium by volume is only 5.2 parts per million. The concentration is low and fairly constant despite the continuous production of new helium because most helium in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere escapes into space by several processes. In the Earth&#x27;s heterosphere, a part of the upper atmosphere, helium and hydrogen are the most abundant elements.

Most helium on Earth is a result of radioactive decay. Helium is found in large amounts in minerals of uranium and thorium, including uraninite and its varieties cleveite and pitchblende, carnotite and monazite (a group name; &quot;monazite&quot; usually refers to monazite-(Ce)), because they emit alpha particles (helium nuclei, He2+) to which electrons immediately combine as soon as the particle is stopped by the rock. In this way an estimated 3000 metric tons of helium are generated per year throughout the lithosphere. In the Earth&#x27;s crust, the concentration of helium is 8 parts per billion. In seawater, the concentration is only 4 parts per trillion. There are also small amounts in mineral springs, volcanic gas, and meteoric iron. Because helium is trapped in the subsurface under conditions that also trap natural gas, the greatest natural concentrations of helium on the planet are found in natural gas, from which most commercial helium is extracted. The concentration varies in a broad range from a few ppm to more than 7% in a small gas field in San Juan County, New Mexico.

, the world&#x27;s helium reserves were estimated at 31 billion cubic meters, with a third of that being in Qatar. In 2015 and 2016 additional probable reserves were announced to be under the Rocky Mountains in North America and in the East African Rift.

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has proposed an October 2024 plan for managing natural resources in western Colorado. The plan involves closing 543,000 acres to oil and gas leasing while keeping 692,300 acres open. Among the open areas, 165,700 acres have been identified as suitable for helium recovery. The United States possesses an estimated 306 billion cubic feet of recoverable helium, sufficient to meet current consumption rates of 2.15 billion cubic feet per year for approximately 150 years.

===Modern extraction and distribution===

For large-scale use, helium is extracted by fractional distillation from natural gas, which can contain as much as 7% helium. Since helium has a lower boiling point than any other element, low temperatures and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases (mostly nitrogen and methane). The resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures, in which almost all of the remaining nitrogen and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture. Activated charcoal is used as a final purification step, usually resulting in 99.995% pure Grade-A helium. The principal impurity in Grade-A helium is neon. In a final production step, most of the helium that is produced is liquefied via a cryogenic process. This is necessary for applications requiring liquid helium and also allows helium suppliers to reduce the cost of long-distance transportation, as the largest liquid helium containers have more than five times the capacity of the largest gaseous helium tube trailers.

In 2008, approximately 169 million standard cubic meters (SCM) of helium were extracted from natural gas or withdrawn from helium reserves, with approximately 78% from the United States, 10% from Algeria, and most of the remainder from Russia, Poland, and Qatar. By 2013, increases in helium production in Qatar (under the company Qatargas managed by Air Liquide) had increased Qatar&#x27;s fraction of world helium production to 25%, making it the second largest exporter after the United States.
An estimated deposit of helium was found in Tanzania in 2016. A large-scale helium plant was opened in Ningxia, China in 2020.

In the United States, most helium is extracted from the natural gas of the Hugoton and nearby gas fields in Kansas, Oklahoma, and the Panhandle Field in Texas. Much of this gas was once sent by pipeline to the National Helium Reserve, but since 2005, this reserve has been depleted and sold off, and it is expected to be largely depleted by 2021 under the October 2013 &quot;Responsible Helium Administration and Stewardship Act&quot; (H.R. 527). The helium fields of the western United States are emerging as an alternate source of helium supply, particularly those of the &quot;Four Corners&quot; region (the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah).

Diffusion of crude natural gas through special semipermeable membranes and other barriers is another method to recover and purify helium. In 1996, the U.S. had &quot;proven&quot; helium reserves in such gas well complexes of about 147 billion standard cubic feet (4.2 billion SCM). At rates of use at that time (72 million SCM per year in the U.S.; see pie chart below) this would have been enough helium for about 58 years of U.S. use, and less than this (perhaps 80% of the time) at world use rates, although factors in saving and processing impact effective reserve numbers.

Helium is generally extracted from natural gas because it is present in air at only a fraction of that of neon, yet the demand for it is far higher. It is estimated that if all neon production were retooled to save helium, 0.1% of the world&#x27;s helium demands would be satisfied. Similarly, only 1% of the world&#x27;s helium demands could be satisfied by re-tooling all air distillation plants. Helium can be synthesized by bombardment of lithium or boron with high-velocity protons, or by bombardment of lithium with deuterons, but these processes are a completely uneconomical method of production.

Helium is commercially available in either liquid or gaseous form. As a liquid, it can be supplied in small insulated containers called dewars which hold as much as 1,000 liters of helium, or in large ISO containers, which have nominal capacities as large as 42 m3 (around 11,000 U.S. gallons). In gaseous form, small quantities of helium are supplied in high-pressure cylinders holding as much as 8 m3 (approximately . 282 standard cubic feet), while large quantities of high-pressure gas are supplied in tube trailers, which have capacities of as much as 4,860 m3 (approx. 172,000 standard cubic feet).

===Conservation advocates===
According to helium conservationists like Nobel laureate physicist Robert Coleman Richardson, writing in 2010, the free market price of helium has contributed to &quot;wasteful&quot; usage (e.g. for helium balloons). Prices in the 2000s had been lowered by the decision of the U.S. Congress to sell off the country&#x27;s large helium stockpile by 2015. According to Richardson, the price needed to be multiplied by 20 to eliminate the excessive wasting of helium. In the 2012 Nuttall et al. paper titled &quot;Stop squandering helium&quot;, it was also proposed to create an International Helium Agency that would build a sustainable market for &quot;this precious commodity&quot;.

==Applications==


While balloons are perhaps the best-known use of helium, they are a minor part of all helium use. Helium is used for many purposes that require some of its unique properties, such as its low boiling point, low density, low solubility, high thermal conductivity, or inertness. Of the 2014 world helium total production of about 32 million kg (180 million standard cubic meters) helium per year, the largest use (about 32% of the total in 2014) is in cryogenic applications, most of which involves cooling the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners and NMR spectrometers. Other major uses were pressurizing and purging systems, welding, maintenance of controlled atmospheres, and leak detection. Other uses by category were relatively minor fractions.

=== Controlled atmospheres ===
Helium is used as a protective gas in growing silicon and germanium crystals, in titanium and zirconium production, and in gas chromatography, because it is inert. Because of its inertness, thermally and calorically perfect nature, high speed of sound, and high value of the heat capacity ratio, it is also useful in supersonic wind tunnels and impulse facilities.

=== Gas tungsten arc welding ===

Helium is used as a shielding gas in arc welding processes on materials that, at welding temperatures are contaminated and weakened by air or nitrogen. A number of inert shielding gases are used in gas tungsten arc welding, but helium is used instead of cheaper argon especially for welding materials that have higher heat conductivity, like aluminium or copper.

=== Minor uses ===

==== Industrial leak detection ====
One industrial application for helium is leak detection. Because helium diffuses through solids three times faster than air, it is used as a tracer gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers. The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 10−9 mbar·L/s (10−10 Pa·m3/s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.

Helium leaks through cracks should not be confused with gas permeation through a bulk material. While helium has documented permeation constants (thus a calculable permeation rate) through glasses, ceramics, and synthetic materials, inert gases such as helium will not permeate most bulk metals.

==== Flight ====

Because it is lighter than air, airships and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant and escapes permeating through a membrane at a lower rate, helium has the advantage of being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to backfill rocket propellant tanks in flight and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about of helium to launch.

==== Minor commercial and recreational uses ====
Helium as a breathing gas has no narcotic properties, so helium mixtures such as trimix, heliox and heliair are used for deep diving to reduce the effects of narcosis, which worsen with increasing depth. As pressure increases with depth, the density of the breathing gas also increases, and the low molecular weight of helium is found to considerably reduce the effort of breathing by lowering the density of the mixture. This reduces the Reynolds number of flow, leading to a reduction of turbulent flow and an increase in laminar flow, which requires less breathing. At depths below divers breathing helium-oxygen mixtures begin to experience tremors and a decrease in psychomotor function, symptoms of high-pressure nervous syndrome. This effect may be countered to some extent by adding an amount of narcotic gas such as hydrogen or nitrogen to a helium–oxygen mixture.

Helium–neon lasers, a type of low-powered gas laser producing a red beam, had various practical applications which included barcode readers and laser pointers, before they were almost universally replaced by cheaper diode lasers.

For its inertness and high thermal conductivity, neutron transparency, and because it does not form radioactive isotopes under reactor conditions, helium is used as a heat-transfer medium in some gas-cooled nuclear reactors.

Helium, mixed with a heavier gas such as xenon, is useful for thermoacoustic refrigeration due to the resulting high heat capacity ratio and low Prandtl number. The inertness of helium has environmental advantages over conventional refrigeration systems which contribute to ozone depletion or global warming.

Helium is also used in some hard disk drives.

==== Scientific uses ====
The use of helium reduces the distorting effects of temperature variations in the space between lenses in some telescopes due to its extremely low index of refraction. This method is especially used in solar telescopes where a vacuum tight telescope tube would be too heavy.

Helium is a commonly used carrier gas for gas chromatography.

The age of rocks and minerals that contain uranium and thorium can be estimated by measuring the level of helium with a process known as helium dating.

Helium at low temperatures is used in cryogenics and in certain cryogenic applications. As examples of applications, liquid helium is used to cool certain metals to the extremely low temperatures required for superconductivity, such as in superconducting magnets for magnetic resonance imaging. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN uses 96 metric tons of liquid helium to maintain the temperature at .

==== Medical uses ====
Helium was approved for medical use in the United States in April 2020 for humans and animals.

==As a contaminant==
While chemically inert, helium contamination impairs the operation of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) such that iPhones may fail.

==Inhalation and safety==

===Effects===
Neutral helium at standard conditions is non-toxic, plays no biological role and is found in trace amounts in human blood.
The speed of sound in helium is nearly three times the speed of sound in air. Because the natural resonance frequency of a gas-filled cavity is proportional to the speed of sound in the gas, when helium is inhaled, a corresponding increase occurs in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract, which is the amplifier of vocal sound. This increase in the resonant frequency of the amplifier (the vocal tract) gives increased amplification to the high-frequency components of the sound wave produced by the direct vibration of the vocal folds, compared to the case when the voice box is filled with air. When a person speaks after inhaling helium gas, the muscles that control the voice box still move in the same way as when the voice box is filled with air; therefore the fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds does not change. However, the high-frequency-preferred amplification causes a change in timbre of the amplified sound, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.

===Hazards===
Inhaling helium can be dangerous if done to excess, since helium is a simple asphyxiant and so displaces oxygen needed for normal respiration. Fatalities have been recorded, including a youth who suffocated in Vancouver in 2003 and two adults who suffocated in South Florida in 2006. In 1998, an Australian girl from Victoria fell unconscious and temporarily turned blue after inhaling the entire contents of a party balloon.
Inhaling helium directly from pressurized cylinders or even balloon filling valves is extremely dangerous, as high flow rate and pressure can result in barotrauma, fatally rupturing lung tissue.

Death caused by helium is rare. The first media-recorded case was that of a 15-year-old girl from Texas who died in 1998 from helium inhalation at a friend&#x27;s party; the exact type of helium death is unidentified.

In the United States, only two fatalities were reported between 2000 and 2004, including a man who died in North Carolina of barotrauma in 2002. A youth asphyxiated in Vancouver during 2003, and a 27-year-old man in Australia had an embolism after breathing from a cylinder in 2000. Since then, two adults asphyxiated in South Florida in 2006, and there were cases in 2009 and 2010, one of whom was a Californian youth who was found with a bag over his head, attached to a helium tank, and another teenager in Northern Ireland died of asphyxiation. At Eagle Point, Oregon a teenage girl died in 2012 from barotrauma at a party. A girl from Michigan died from hypoxia later in the year.

On February 4, 2015, it was revealed that, during the recording of their main TV show on January 28, a 12-year-old member (name withheld) of Japanese all-girl singing group 3B Junior suffered from air embolism, losing consciousness and falling into a coma as a result of air bubbles blocking the flow of blood to the brain after inhaling huge quantities of helium as part of a game. The incident was not made public until a week later. The staff of TV Asahi held an emergency press conference to communicate that the member had been taken to the hospital and is showing signs of rehabilitation such as moving eyes and limbs, but her consciousness has not yet been sufficiently recovered. Police have launched an investigation due to a neglect of safety measures.

The safety issues for cryogenic helium are similar to those of liquid nitrogen; its extremely low temperatures can result in cold burns, and the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure-relief devices are installed. Containers of helium gas at 5 to 10 K should be handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant thermal expansion that occurs when helium gas at less than 10 K is warmed to room temperature.

At high pressures (more than about 20 atm or two MPa), a mixture of helium and oxygen (heliox) can lead to high-pressure nervous syndrome, a sort of reverse-anesthetic effect; adding a small amount of nitrogen to the mixture can alleviate the problem.

<text>In organic chemistry, a hydrocarbon is an organic compound consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. Hydrocarbons are examples of group 14 hydrides. Hydrocarbons are generally colourless and hydrophobic; their odor is usually faint, and may be similar to that of gasoline or lighter fluid. They occur in a diverse range of molecular structures and phases: they can be gases (such as methane and propane), liquids (such as hexane and benzene), low melting solids (such as paraffin wax and naphthalene) or polymers (such as polyethylene and polystyrene).

In the fossil fuel industries, &quot;hydrocarbon&quot; refers to naturally occurring petroleum, natural gas and coal, or their hydrocarbon derivatives and purified forms. Combustion of hydrocarbons is the main source of the world&#x27;s energy. Petroleum is the dominant raw-material source for organic commodity chemicals such as solvents and polymers. Most anthropogenic (human-generated) emissions of greenhouse gases are either carbon dioxide released by the burning of fossil fuels, or methane released from the handling of natural gas or from agriculture.

==Types==
As defined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry&#x27;s nomenclature of organic chemistry, hydrocarbons are classified as follows:
# Saturated hydrocarbons, which are the simplest of the hydrocarbon types. They are composed entirely of single bonds and are saturated with hydrogen. The formula for acyclic saturated hydrocarbons (i.e., alkanes) is CH. The most general form of saturated hydrocarbons, (whether linear or branched species, and whether with or without one or more rings) is CH, where &quot;r&quot; is the number of rings. Those with exactly one ring are the cycloalkanes. Saturated hydrocarbons are the basis of petroleum fuels and may be either linear or branched species. One or more of the hydrogen atoms can be replaced with other atoms, for example chlorine or another halogen: this is called a substitution reaction. An example is the conversion of methane to chloroform using a chlorination reaction. Halogenating a hydrocarbon produces something that is not a hydrocarbon. It is a very common and useful process. Hydrocarbons with the same molecular formula but different structural formulae are called structural isomers. As given in the example of 3-methylhexane and its higher homologues, branched hydrocarbons can be chiral. Chiral saturated hydrocarbons constitute the side chains of biomolecules such as chlorophyll and tocopherol.
# Unsaturated hydrocarbons, which have one or more double or triple bonds between carbon atoms. Those with one or more double bonds are called alkenes. Those with one double bond have the formula CH (assuming non-cyclic structures). Those containing triple bonds are called alkyne. Those with one triple bond have the formula CH.
# Aromatic hydrocarbons, also known as arenes, which are hydrocarbons that have at least one aromatic ring. 10% of total nonmethane organic carbon emission are aromatic hydrocarbons from the exhaust of gasoline-powered vehicles.

The term &#x27;aliphatic&#x27; refers to non-aromatic hydrocarbons. Saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons are sometimes referred to as &#x27;paraffins&#x27;. Aliphatic hydrocarbons containing a double bond between carbon atoms are sometimes referred to as &#x27;olefins&#x27;.

==Usage==

The predominant use of hydrocarbons is as a combustible fuel source. Methane is the predominant component of natural gas. C6 through C10 alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, and aromatic hydrocarbons are the main components of gasoline, naphtha, jet fuel, and specialized industrial solvent mixtures. With the progressive addition of carbon units, the simple non-ring structured hydrocarbons have higher viscosities, lubricating indices, boiling points, and solidification temperatures. At the opposite extreme from methane lie the heavy tars that remain as the &quot;lowest fraction&quot; in a crude oil refining retort. They are collected and widely utilized as roofing compounds, pavement material (bitumen), wood preservatives (the creosote series) and as extremely high viscosity shear-resisting liquids.

Some large-scale non-fuel applications of hydrocarbons begin with ethane and propane, which are obtained from petroleum and natural gas. These two gases are converted either to syngas or to ethylene and propylene respectively. Global consumption of benzene in 2021 is estimated at more than 58 million metric tons, which will increase to 60 million tons in 2022.

Hydrocarbons are also prevalent in nature. Some eusocial arthropods, such as the Brazilian stingless bee, &quot;Schwarziana quadripunctata&quot;, use unique cuticular hydrocarbon &quot;scents&quot; in order to determine kin from non-kin. This hydrocarbon composition varies between age, sex, nest location, and hierarchal position.

There is also potential to harvest hydrocarbons from plants like &quot;Euphorbia lathyris&quot; and &quot;E. tirucalli&quot; as an alternative and renewable energy source for vehicles that use diesel. Furthermore, endophytic bacteria from plants that naturally produce hydrocarbons have been used in hydrocarbon degradation in attempts to deplete hydrocarbon concentration in polluted soils.

==Reactions==
Saturated hydrocarbons are notable for their inertness. Unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes and aromatic compounds) react more readily, by means of substitution, addition, polymerization. At higher temperatures they undergo dehydrogenation, oxidation and combustion.

===Saturated hydrocarbons===
====Cracking====
The cracking of saturated hydrocarbons is the main industrial route to alkenes and alkyne. These reactions require heterogeneous catalysts and temperatures &gt;500 °C.
===Oxidation===
Widely practice conversions of hydrocarbons involves their reaction with oxygen. In the presence of excess oxygen, hydrocarbons combust. With, however, careful conditions, which have been optimized for many years, partial oxidation results. Useful compounds can obtained in this way: maleic acid from butane, terephthalic acid from xylenes, acetone together with phenol from cumene (isopropylbenzene), and cyclohexanone from cyclohexane]]. The process, which is called autoxidation, begins with the formation of hydroperoxides (ROOH).

====Combustion====

Combustion of hydrocarbons is currently the main source of the world&#x27;s energy for electric power generation, heating (such as home heating), and transportation. Often this energy is used directly as heat such as in home heaters, which use either petroleum or natural gas. The hydrocarbon is burnt and the heat is used to heat water, which is then circulated. A similar principle is used to create electrical energy in power plants. Both saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons undergo this process.

Common properties of hydrocarbons are the facts that they produce steam, carbon dioxide and heat during combustion and that oxygen is required for combustion to take place. The simplest hydrocarbon, methane, burns as follows:
:&lt;chem&gt;\underset{methane}{CH4} + 2O2 -&gt; CO2 + 2H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

In inadequate supply of air, carbon black and water vapour are formed:
:&lt;chem&gt;\underset{methane}{CH4} + O2 -&gt; C + 2H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

And finally, for any linear alkane of n carbon atoms,
:formula_1

Partial oxidation characterizes the reactions of alkenes and oxygen. This process is the basis of rancidification and paint drying.

Benzene burns with sooty flame when heated in air:
:&lt;chem&gt;\underset{benzene}{C6H6} + {15\over 2}O2 -&gt; 6CO2 {+} 3H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

====Halogenation====
{{Main|Free-radical halogenation}}
Saturated hydrocarbons react with chlorine and fluorine. In the case of chlorination, one of the chlorine atoms replaces a hydrogen atom. The reactions proceed via free-radical pathways, in which the halogen first dissociates into a two neutral radical atoms (homolytic fission).
:CH{{sub|4}} + Cl{{sub|2}} → CH{{sub|3}}Cl + HCl
:CH{{sub|3}}Cl + Cl{{sub|2}} → CH{{sub|2}}Cl{{sub|2}} + HCl
all the way to CCl{{sub|4}} (carbon tetrachloride)

:C{{sub|2}}H{{sub|6}} + Cl{{sub|2}} → C{{sub|2}}H{{sub|5}}Cl + HCl
:C{{sub|2}}H{{sub|4}}Cl{{sub|2}} + Cl{{sub|2}} → C{{sub|2}}H{{sub|3}}Cl{{sub|3}} + HCl
all the way to C{{sub|2}}Cl{{sub|6}} (hexachloroethane)

===Unsaturated hydrocarbons===
====Substitution====
{{Main|Substitution reaction}}
Aromatic compounds, almost uniquely for hydrocarbons, undergo substitution reactions. The chemical process practiced on the largest scale is the reaction of benzene and ethene to give ethylbenzene:
:{{chem2|C6H6 + C2H4 -&gt; C6H5CH2CH3}}
The resulting ethylbenzene is dehydrogenated to styrene and then polymerized to manufacture polystyrene, a common thermoplastic material.

====Addition====
{{Main|Addition reaction}}
{{Main|Hydrogenation}}
{{Main|Polyolefin}}
{{Further information|Addition polymer}}

Addition reactions apply to alkenes and alkynes. It is because they add reagents that they are called unsaturated. In this reaction a variety of reagents add &quot;across&quot; the pi-bond(s). Chlorine, hydrogen chloride, water, and hydrogen are illustrative reagents. 

Polymerization is a form of addition. Alkenes and some alkynes also undergo polymerization by opening of the multiple bonds to produce polyethylene, polybutylene, and polystyrene. The alkyne acetylene polymerizes to produce polyacetylene. Oligomers (chains of a few monomers) may be produced, for example in the Shell higher olefin process, where α-olefins are extended to make longer α-olefins by adding ethylene repeatedly.

===Metathesis===
Some hydrocarbons undergo &quot;metathesis&quot;, in which substituents attached by C–C bonds are exchanged between molecules. For a single C–C bond it is alkane metathesis, for a double C–C bond it is alkene metathesis (olefin metathesis), and for a triple C–C bond it is alkyne metathesis.

==Origin==
The vast majority of hydrocarbons found on Earth occur in crude oil, petroleum, coal, and natural gas. For thousands of years they have been exploited and used for a vast range of purposes. Petroleum ({{lit|rock oil}}) and coal are generally thought to be products of decomposition of organic matter. Coal, in contrast to petroleum, is richer in carbon and poorer in hydrogen. Natural gas is the product of methanogenesis.

A seemingly limitless variety of compounds comprise petroleum, hence the necessity of refineries. These hydrocarbons consist of saturated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, or combinations of the two. Missing in petroleum are alkenes and alkynes. Their production requires refineries. Petroleum-derived hydrocarbons are mainly consumed for fuel, but they are also the source of virtually all synthetic organic compounds, including plastics and pharmaceuticals. Natural gas is consumed almost exclusively as fuel. Coal is used as a fuel and as a reducing agent in metallurgy.

A small fraction of hydrocarbon found on earth, and all currently known hydrocarbon found on other planets and moons, is thought to be abiological.

Hydrocarbons such as ethylene, isoprene, and monoterpenes are emitted by living vegetation.

Some hydrocarbons also are widespread and abundant in the Solar System. Lakes of liquid methane and ethane have been found on Titan, Saturn&#x27;s largest moon, as confirmed by the &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; space probe. Hydrocarbons are also abundant in nebulae forming polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds.

==Environmental impact==
Burning hydrocarbons as fuel, which produces carbon dioxide and water, is a major contributor to anthropogenic global warming.
Hydrocarbons are introduced into the environment through their extensive use as fuels and chemicals as well as through leaks or accidental spills during exploration, production, refining, or transport of fossil fuels. Anthropogenic hydrocarbon contamination of soil is a serious global issue due to contaminant persistence and the negative impact on human health.

When soil is contaminated by hydrocarbons, it can have a significant impact on its microbiological, chemical, and physical properties. This can serve to prevent, slow down or even accelerate the growth of vegetation depending on the exact changes that occur. Crude oil and natural gas are the two largest sources of hydrocarbon contamination of soil.

===Bioremediation===
Bioremediation of hydrocarbon from soil or water contaminated is a formidable challenge because of the chemical inertness that characterize hydrocarbons (hence they survived millions of years in the source rock). Nonetheless, many strategies have been devised, bioremediation being prominent. The basic problem with bioremediation is the paucity of enzymes that act on them. Nonetheless, the area has received regular attention.
Bacteria in the gabbroic layer of the ocean&#x27;s crust can degrade hydrocarbons; but the extreme environment makes research difficult. Other bacteria such as &quot;Lutibacterium anuloederans&quot; can also degrade hydrocarbons.
Mycoremediation or breaking down of hydrocarbon by mycelium and mushrooms is possible.

==Safety==
{{main|Hydrocarbon poisoning}}
Hydrocarbons are generally of low toxicity, hence the widespread use of gasoline and related volatile products. Aromatic compounds such as benzene and toluene are narcotic and chronic toxins, and benzene in particular is known to be carcinogenic. Certain rare polycyclic aromatic compounds are carcinogenic.
Hydrocarbons are highly flammable.

<text>The halogens () are a group in the periodic table consisting of six chemically related elements: fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and the radioactive elements astatine (At) and tennessine (Ts), though some authors would exclude tennessine as its chemistry is unknown and is theoretically expected to be more like that of gallium. In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, this group is known as group 17.

The word &quot;halogen&quot; means &quot;salt former&quot; or &quot;salt maker&quot;. When halogens react with metals, they produce a wide range of salts, including calcium fluoride, sodium chloride (common table salt), silver bromide and potassium iodide.

The group of halogens is the only periodic table group that contains elements in three of the main states of matter at standard temperature and pressure, though not far above room temperature the same becomes true of groups 1 and 15, assuming white phosphorus is taken as the standard state. All of the halogens form acids when bonded to hydrogen. Most halogens are typically produced from minerals or salts. The middle halogens—chlorine, bromine, and iodine—are often used as disinfectants. Organobromides are the most important class of flame retardants, while elemental halogens are dangerous and can be toxic.
== History ==
The fluorine mineral fluorospar was known as early as 1529. Early chemists realized that fluorine compounds contain an undiscovered element, but were unable to isolate it. In 1860, George Gore, an English chemist, ran a current of electricity through hydrofluoric acid and probably produced fluorine, but he was unable to prove his results at the time. In 1886, Henri Moissan, a chemist in Paris, performed electrolysis on potassium bifluoride dissolved in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, and successfully isolated fluorine.

Hydrochloric acid was known to alchemists and early chemists. However, elemental chlorine was not produced until 1774, when Carl Wilhelm Scheele heated hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide. Scheele called the element &quot;dephlogisticated muriatic acid&quot;, which is how chlorine was known for 33 years. In 1807, Humphry Davy investigated chlorine and discovered that it is an actual element. Chlorine gas was used as a poisonous gas during World War I. It displaced oxygen in contaminated areas and replaced common oxygenated air with the toxic chlorine gas. The gas would burn human tissue externally and internally, especially the lungs, making breathing difficult or impossible depending on the level of contamination.

Bromine was discovered in the 1820s by Antoine Jérôme Balard. Balard discovered bromine by passing chlorine gas through a sample of brine. He originally proposed the name &quot;muride&quot; for the new element, but the French Academy changed the element&#x27;s name to bromine.

Iodine was discovered by Bernard Courtois, who was using seaweed ash as part of a process for saltpeter manufacture. Courtois typically boiled the seaweed ash with water to generate potassium chloride. However, in 1811, Courtois added sulfuric acid to his process and found that his process produced purple fumes that condensed into black crystals. Suspecting that these crystals were a new element, Courtois sent samples to other chemists for investigation. Iodine was proven to be a new element by Joseph Gay-Lussac.

In 1931, Fred Allison claimed to have discovered element 85 with a magneto-optical machine, and named the element Alabamine, but was mistaken. In 1937, Rajendralal De claimed to have discovered element 85 in minerals, and called the element dakine, but he was also mistaken. An attempt at discovering element 85 in 1939 by Horia Hulubei and Yvette Cauchois via spectroscopy was also unsuccessful, as was an attempt in the same year by Walter Minder, who discovered an iodine-like element resulting from beta decay of polonium. Element 85, now named astatine, was produced successfully in 1940 by Dale R. Corson, K.R. Mackenzie, and Emilio G. Segrè, who bombarded bismuth with alpha particles.

In 2010, a team led by nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian involving scientists from the JINR, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Vanderbilt University successfully bombarded berkelium-249 atoms with calcium-48 atoms to make tennessine. 

=== Etymology ===
In 1811, the German chemist Johann Schweigger proposed that the name &quot;halogen&quot; – meaning &quot;salt producer&quot;, from αλς [hals] &quot;salt&quot; and γενειν [genein] &quot;to beget&quot; – replace the name &quot;chlorine&quot;, which had been proposed by the English chemist Humphry Davy. Davy&#x27;s name for the element prevailed. However, in 1826, the Swedish chemist Baron Jöns Jacob Berzelius proposed the term &quot;halogen&quot; for the elements fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, which produce a sea-salt-like substance when they form a compound with an alkaline metal.

The English names of these elements all have the ending -ine. Fluorine&#x27;s name comes from the Latin word &quot;fluere&quot;, meaning &quot;to flow&quot;, because it was derived from the mineral fluorite, which was used as a flux in metalworking. Chlorine&#x27;s name comes from the Greek word &quot;chloros&quot;, meaning &quot;greenish-yellow&quot;. Bromine&#x27;s name comes from the Greek word &quot;bromos&quot;, meaning &quot;stench&quot;. Iodine&#x27;s name comes from the Greek word &quot;iodes&quot;, meaning &quot;violet&quot;. Astatine&#x27;s name comes from the Greek word &quot;astatos&quot;, meaning &quot;unstable&quot;. Tennessine is named after the US state of Tennessee, where it was synthesized.

== Characteristics ==

=== Chemical ===

The halogens fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine are nonmetals; the chemical properties of astatine and tennessine, two heaviest group 17 members, have not been conclusively investigated. The halogens show trends in chemical bond energy moving from top to bottom of the periodic table column with fluorine deviating slightly. It follows a trend in having the highest bond energy in compounds with other atoms, but it has very weak bonds within the diatomic F2 molecule. This means that further down group 17 in the periodic table, the reactivity of elements decreases because of the increasing size of the atoms.

Halogens are highly reactive, and as such can be harmful or lethal to biological organisms in sufficient quantities. This high reactivity is due to the high electronegativity of the atoms due to their high effective nuclear charge. Because the halogens have seven valence electrons in their outermost energy level, they can gain an electron by reacting with atoms of other elements to satisfy the octet rule. Fluorine is the most reactive of all elements; it is the only element more electronegative than oxygen, it attacks otherwise-inert materials such as glass, and it forms compounds with the usually inert noble gases. It is a corrosive and highly toxic gas. The reactivity of fluorine is such that, if used or stored in laboratory glassware, it can react with glass in the presence of small amounts of water to form silicon tetrafluoride (SiF4). Thus, fluorine must be handled with substances such as Teflon (which is itself an organofluorine compound), extremely dry glass, or metals such as copper or steel, which form a protective layer of fluoride on their surface.

The high reactivity of fluorine allows some of the strongest bonds possible, especially to carbon. For example, Teflon is fluorine bonded with carbon and is extremely resistant to thermal and chemical attacks and has a high melting point.

==== Molecules ====

===== Diatomic halogen molecules =====

The stable halogens form homonuclear diatomic molecules.
Due to relatively weak intermolecular forces, chlorine and fluorine form part of the group known as &quot;elemental gases&quot;.

The elements become less reactive and have higher melting points as the atomic number increases. The higher melting points are caused by stronger London dispersion forces resulting from more electrons.

==== Compounds ====

===== Hydrogen halides =====

All of the halogens have been observed to react with hydrogen to form hydrogen halides. For fluorine, chlorine, and bromine, this reaction is in the form of:

: H2 + X2 → 2HX

However, hydrogen iodide and hydrogen astatide can split back into their constituent elements.

The hydrogen-halogen reactions get gradually less reactive toward the heavier halogens. A fluorine-hydrogen reaction is explosive even when it is dark and cold. A chlorine-hydrogen reaction is also explosive, but only in the presence of light and heat. A bromine-hydrogen reaction is even less explosive; it is explosive only when exposed to flames. Iodine and astatine only partially react with hydrogen, forming equilibria.

All halogens form binary compounds with hydrogen known as the hydrogen halides: hydrogen fluoride (HF), hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen bromide (HBr), hydrogen iodide (HI), and hydrogen astatide (HAt). All of these compounds form acids when mixed with water. Hydrogen fluoride is the only hydrogen halide that forms hydrogen bonds. Hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, and acid are all strong acids, but hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid.

All of the hydrogen halides are irritants. Hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride are highly acidic. Hydrogen fluoride is used as an industrial chemical, and is highly toxic, causing pulmonary edema and damaging cells. Hydrogen chloride is also a dangerous chemical. Breathing in gas with more than fifty parts per million of hydrogen chloride can cause death in humans. Hydrogen bromide is even more toxic and irritating than hydrogen chloride. Breathing in gas with more than thirty parts per million of hydrogen bromide can be lethal to humans. Hydrogen iodide, like other hydrogen halides, is toxic.

===== Metal halides =====

All the halogens are known to react with sodium to form sodium fluoride, sodium chloride, sodium bromide, sodium iodide, and sodium astatide. Heated sodium&#x27;s reaction with halogens produces bright-orange flames. Sodium&#x27;s reaction with chlorine is in the form of:

Iron reacts with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine to form iron(III) halides. These reactions are in the form of:

However, when iron reacts with iodine, it forms only iron(II) iodide.

Iron wool can react rapidly with fluorine to form the white compound iron(III) fluoride even in cold temperatures. When chlorine comes into contact with a heated iron, they react to form the black iron(III) chloride. However, if the reaction conditions are moist, this reaction will instead result in a reddish-brown product. Iron can also react with bromine to form iron(III) bromide. This compound is reddish-brown in dry conditions. Iron&#x27;s reaction with bromine is less reactive than its reaction with fluorine or chlorine. A hot iron can also react with iodine, but it forms iron(II) iodide. This compound may be gray, but the reaction is always contaminated with excess iodine, so it is not known for sure. Iron&#x27;s reaction with iodine is less vigorous than its reaction with the lighter halogens.

===== Interhalogen compounds =====
Interhalogen compounds are in the form of XYn where X and Y are halogens and n is one, three, five, or seven. Interhalogen compounds contain at most two different halogens. Large interhalogens, such as can be produced by a reaction of a pure halogen with a smaller interhalogen such as . All interhalogens except can be produced by directly combining pure halogens in various conditions.

Interhalogens are typically more reactive than all diatomic halogen molecules except F2 because interhalogen bonds are weaker. However, the chemical properties of interhalogens are still roughly the same as those of diatomic halogens. Many interhalogens consist of one or more atoms of fluorine bonding to a heavier halogen. Chlorine and bromine can bond with up to five fluorine atoms, and iodine can bond with up to seven fluorine atoms. Most interhalogen compounds are covalent gases. However, some interhalogens are liquids, such as BrF3, and many iodine-containing interhalogens are solids.

===== Organohalogen compounds =====
Many synthetic organic compounds such as plastic polymers, and a few natural ones, contain halogen atoms; these are known as &quot;halogenated&quot; compounds or organic halides. Chlorine is by far the most abundant of the halogens in seawater, and the only one needed in relatively large amounts (as chloride ions) by humans. For example, chloride ions play a key role in brain function by mediating the action of the inhibitory transmitter GABA and are also used by the body to produce stomach acid. Iodine is needed in trace amounts for the production of thyroid hormones such as thyroxine. Organohalogens are also synthesized through the nucleophilic abstraction reaction.

===== Polyhalogenated compounds =====

Polyhalogenated compounds are industrially created compounds substituted with multiple halogens. Many of them are very toxic and bioaccumulate in humans, and have a very wide application range. They include PCBs, PBDEs, and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), as well as numerous other compounds.

==== Reactions ====

===== Reactions with water =====
Fluorine reacts vigorously with water to produce oxygen (O2) and hydrogen fluoride (HF):

Chlorine has maximum solubility of ca. 7.1 g Cl2 per kg of water at ambient temperature (21 °C). Dissolved chlorine reacts to form hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid, a solution that can be used as a disinfectant or bleach:

Bromine has a solubility of 3.41 g per 100 g of water, but it slowly reacts to form hydrogen bromide (HBr) and hypobromous acid (HBrO):

Iodine, however, is minimally soluble in water (0.03 g/100 g water at 20 °C) and does not react with it. However, iodine will form an aqueous solution in the presence of iodide ion, such as by addition of potassium iodide (KI), because the triiodide ion is formed.

=== Physical and atomic ===
The table below is a summary of the key physical and atomic properties of the halogens. Data marked with question marks are either uncertain or are estimations partially based on periodic trends rather than observations.



==== Isotopes ====
Fluorine has one stable and naturally occurring isotope, fluorine-19. However, there are trace amounts in nature of the radioactive isotope fluorine-23, which occurs via cluster decay of protactinium-231. A total of eighteen isotopes of fluorine have been discovered, with atomic masses ranging from 13 to 31. 

Chlorine has two stable and naturally occurring isotopes, chlorine-35 and chlorine-37. However, there are trace amounts in nature of the isotope chlorine-36, which occurs via spallation of argon-36. A total of 24 isotopes of chlorine have been discovered, with atomic masses ranging from 28 to 51.

There are two stable and naturally occurring isotopes of bromine, bromine-79 and bromine-81. A total of 33 isotopes of bromine have been discovered, with atomic masses ranging from 66 to 98. 

There is one stable and naturally occurring isotope of iodine, iodine-127. However, there are trace amounts in nature of the radioactive isotope iodine-129, which occurs via spallation and from the radioactive decay of uranium in ores. Several other radioactive isotopes of iodine have also been created naturally via the decay of uranium. A total of 38 isotopes of iodine have been discovered, with atomic masses ranging from 108 to 145.

There are no stable isotopes of astatine. However, there are four naturally occurring radioactive isotopes of astatine produced via radioactive decay of uranium, neptunium, and plutonium. These isotopes are astatine-215, astatine-217, astatine-218, and astatine-219. A total of 31 isotopes of astatine have been discovered, with atomic masses ranging from 191 to 227.

There are no stable isotopes of tennessine. Tennessine has only two known synthetic radioisotopes, tennessine-293 and tennessine-294.

== Production ==

Approximately six million metric tons of the fluorine mineral fluorite are produced each year. Four hundred-thousand metric tons of hydrofluoric acid are made each year. Fluorine gas is made from hydrofluoric acid produced as a by-product in phosphoric acid manufacture. Approximately 15,000 metric tons of fluorine gas are made per year.

The mineral halite is the mineral that is most commonly mined for chlorine, but the minerals carnallite and sylvite are also mined for chlorine. Forty million metric tons of chlorine are produced each year by the electrolysis of brine.

Approximately 450,000 metric tons of bromine are produced each year. Fifty percent of all bromine produced is produced in the United States, 35% in Israel, and most of the remainder in China. Historically, bromine was produced by adding sulfuric acid and bleaching powder to natural brine. However, in modern times, bromine is produced by electrolysis, a method invented by Herbert Dow. It is also possible to produce bromine by passing chlorine through seawater and then passing air through the seawater.

In 2003, 22,000 metric tons of iodine were produced. Chile produces 40% of all iodine produced, Japan produces 30%, and smaller amounts are produced in Russia and the United States. Until the 1950s, iodine was extracted from kelp. However, in modern times, iodine is produced in other ways. One way that iodine is produced is by mixing sulfur dioxide with nitrate ores, which contain some iodates. Iodine is also extracted from natural gas fields.

Even though astatine is naturally occurring, it is usually produced by bombarding bismuth with alpha particles.

Tennessine is made by using a cyclotron, fusing berkelium-249 and calcium-48 to make tennessine-293 and tennessine-294.

== Applications ==

=== Disinfectants ===
Both chlorine and bromine are used as disinfectants for drinking water, swimming pools, fresh wounds, spas, dishes, and surfaces. They kill bacteria and other potentially harmful microorganisms through a process known as sterilization. Their reactivity is also put to use in bleaching. Sodium hypochlorite, which is produced from chlorine, is the active ingredient of most fabric bleaches, and chlorine-derived bleaches are used in the production of some paper products.

=== Lighting ===
Halogen lamps are a type of incandescent lamp using a tungsten filament in bulbs that have small amounts of a halogen, such as iodine or bromine added. This enables the production of lamps that are much smaller than non-halogen incandescent lightbulbs at the same wattage. The gas reduces the thinning of the filament and blackening of the inside of the bulb resulting in a bulb that has a much greater life. Halogen lamps glow at a higher temperature (2800 to 3400 kelvin) with a whiter colour than other incandescent bulbs. However, this requires bulbs to be manufactured from fused quartz rather than silica glass to reduce breakage.

=== Drug components ===
In drug discovery, the incorporation of halogen atoms into a lead drug candidate results in analogues that are usually more lipophilic and less water-soluble. As a consequence, halogen atoms are used to improve penetration through lipid membranes and tissues. It follows that there is a tendency for some halogenated drugs to accumulate in adipose tissue.

The chemical reactivity of halogen atoms depends on both their point of attachment to the lead and the nature of the halogen. Aromatic halogen groups are far less reactive than aliphatic halogen groups, which can exhibit considerable chemical reactivity. For aliphatic carbon-halogen bonds, the C-F bond is the strongest and usually less chemically reactive than aliphatic C-H bonds. The other aliphatic-halogen bonds are weaker, their reactivity increasing down the periodic table. They are usually more chemically reactive than aliphatic C-H bonds. As a consequence, the most common halogen substitutions are the less reactive aromatic fluorine and chlorine groups.

== Biological role ==
Fluoride anions are found in ivory, bones, teeth, blood, eggs, urine, and hair of organisms. Fluoride anions in very small amounts may be essential for humans. There are 0.5 milligrams of fluorine per liter of human blood. Human bones contain 0.2 to 1.2% fluorine. Human tissue contains approximately 50 parts per billion of fluorine. A typical 70-kilogram human contains 3 to 6 grams of fluorine.

Chloride anions are essential to a large number of species, humans included. The concentration of chlorine in the dry weight of cereals is 10 to 20 parts per million, while in potatoes the concentration of chloride is 0.5%. Plant growth is adversely affected by chloride levels in the soil falling below 2 parts per million. Human blood contains an average of 0.3% chlorine. Human bone typically contains 900 parts per million of chlorine. Human tissue contains approximately 0.2 to 0.5% chlorine. There is a total of 95 grams of chlorine in a typical 70-kilogram human.

Some bromine in the form of the bromide anion is present in all organisms. A biological role for bromine in humans has not been proven, but some organisms contain organobromine compounds. Humans typically consume 1 to 20 milligrams of bromine per day. There are typically 5 parts per million of bromine in human blood, 7 parts per million of bromine in human bones, and 7 parts per million of bromine in human tissue. A typical 70-kilogram human contains 260 milligrams of bromine.

Humans typically consume less than 100 micrograms of iodine per day. Iodine deficiency can cause intellectual disability. Organoiodine compounds occur in humans in some of the glands, especially the thyroid gland, as well as the stomach, epidermis, and immune system. Foods containing iodine include cod, oysters, shrimp, herring, lobsters, sunflower seeds, seaweed, and mushrooms. However, iodine is not known to have a biological role in plants. There are typically 0.06 milligrams per liter of iodine in human blood, 300 parts per billion of iodine in human bones, and 50 to 700 parts per billion of iodine in human tissue. There are 10 to 20 milligrams of iodine in a typical 70-kilogram human.

Astatine, although very scarce, has been found in micrograms in the earth. It has no known biological role because of its high radioactivity, extreme rarity, and has a half-life of just about 8 hours for the most stable isotope. 

Tennessine is purely man-made and has no other roles in nature.

== Toxicity ==
The halogens tend to decrease in toxicity towards the heavier halogens.

Fluorine gas is extremely toxic; breathing in fluorine at a concentration of 25 parts per million is potentially lethal. Hydrofluoric acid is also toxic, being able to penetrate skin and cause highly painful burns. In addition, fluoride anions are toxic, but not as toxic as pure fluorine. Fluoride can be lethal in amounts of 5 to 10 grams. Prolonged consumption of fluoride above concentrations of 1.5 mg/L is associated with a risk of dental fluorosis, an aesthetic condition of the teeth. At concentrations above 4 mg/L, there is an increased risk of developing skeletal fluorosis, a condition in which bone fractures become more common due to the hardening of bones. Current recommended levels in water fluoridation, a way to prevent dental caries, range from 0.7 to 1.2 mg/L to avoid the detrimental effects of fluoride while at the same time reaping the benefits. People with levels between normal levels and those required for skeletal fluorosis tend to have symptoms similar to arthritis.

Chlorine gas is highly toxic. Breathing in chlorine at a concentration of 3 parts per million can rapidly cause a toxic reaction. Breathing in chlorine at a concentration of 50 parts per million is highly dangerous. Breathing in chlorine at a concentration of 500 parts per million for a few minutes is lethal. In addition, breathing in chlorine gas is highly painful because of its corrosive properties. Hydrochloric acid is the acid of chlorine, while relatively nontoxic, it is highly corrosive and releases very irritating and toxic hydrogen chloride gas in open air.

Pure bromine is somewhat toxic but less toxic than fluorine and chlorine. One hundred milligrams of bromine is lethal. Bromide anions are also toxic, but less so than bromine. Bromide has a lethal dose of 30 grams.

Iodine is somewhat toxic, being able to irritate the lungs and eyes, with a safety limit of 1 milligram per cubic meter. When taken orally, 3 grams of iodine can be lethal. Iodide anions are mostly nontoxic, but these can also be deadly if ingested in large amounts.

Astatine is radioactive and thus highly dangerous, but it has not been produced in macroscopic quantities and hence it is most unlikely that its toxicity will be of much relevance to the average individual.

Tennessine cannot be chemically investigated due to how short its half-life is, although its radioactivity would make it very dangerous.

== Superhalogen ==

Certain aluminium clusters have superatom properties. These aluminium clusters are generated as anions ( with &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ... ) in helium gas and reacted with a gas containing iodine. When analyzed by mass spectrometry one main reaction product turns out to be .&lt;ref name=&quot;bergeron/2004&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These clusters of 13 aluminium atoms with an extra electron added do not appear to react with oxygen when it is introduced in the same gas stream. Assuming each atom liberates its 3 valence electrons, this means 40 electrons are present, which is one of the magic numbers for sodium and implies that these numbers are a reflection of the noble gases.

Calculations show that the additional electron is located in the aluminium cluster at the location directly opposite from the iodine atom. The cluster must therefore have a higher electron affinity for the electron than iodine and therefore the aluminium cluster is called a superhalogen (i.e., the vertical electron detachment energies of the moieties that make up the negative ions are larger than those of any halogen atom). The cluster component in the ion is similar to an iodide ion or a bromide ion. The related cluster is expected to behave chemically like the triiodide ion.&lt;ref name=&quot;bergeron/2005&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>A home page (or homepage) is the main web page of a website. Usually, the home page is located at the root of the website&#x27;s domain or subdomain. For example, if the domain is codice_1, the home page is likely located at the URL codice_2.

The term may also refer to the start page shown in a web browser when the application first opens.

== Function ==
A home page is the main web page that a visitor will view when they navigate to a website via a search engine, and it may also function as a landing page to attract visitors. In some cases, the home page is a site directory, particularly when a website has multiple home pages.

Good home page design is usually a high priority for a website; for example, a news website may curate headlines and first paragraphs of top stories, with links to full articles. According to &quot;Homepage Usability&quot;, the home page is the &quot;most important page on any website&quot; and receives the most views of any page. A poorly designed home page can overwhelm and deter visitors from the site. One important use of home pages is communicating the identity and value of a company.

==Browser start page==
When a web browser is launched, it will automatically open at least one web page. This is the browser&#x27;s start page, which is also called its home page.

Start pages can be a website or a special browser page, such as thumbnails of frequently visited websites. Moreover, there is a niche market of websites intended to be used solely as start pages.

<doc id="13260" wikidata="Q2736003" url="?curid=13260" title="Hee Haw">
<text>Hee Haw is an American television variety show featuring country music and humor with the fictional rural &quot;Kornfield Kounty&quot; as the backdrop. It aired from 1969 to 1993, and on TNN from 1996 to 1997. Reruns of the series were broadcast on RFD-TV from September 2008 to April 2020, and aired on Circle. The &quot;Hee Haw&quot; rereruns resumed in May 2024 on the RFD-TV / RuralTV network.

The show was inspired by &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, but centered on country music, rural rather than pop culture–inspired humor, and with far less topical material. Hosted by country music artists Buck Owens and Roy Clark for most of its run, the show was equally well known for its cornpone humor as for its voluptuous, scantily clad women (the &quot;Hee Haw Honeys&quot;) in stereotypical farmer&#x27;s daughter outfits.

&quot;Hee Haw&quot;″s appeal, however, was not limited to a rural audience. It was successful in all of the major markets, including network-based Los Angeles and New York City, as well as Boston and Chicago. Other niche programs such as &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; and &quot;Soul Train&quot;, which targeted older and black audiences, respectively, also rose to prominence in syndication during the era. Like &quot;Laugh-In&quot;, the show minimized production costs by taping all of the recurring sketches for a season in batches, setting up the cornfield set one day, the joke fence on another, etc. At its peak, a season&#x27;s worth of shows were recorded over the course of two separate, week-long shoots, and then assembled in the editing suite. Only musical performances were taped with a live audience, while a laugh track was added to all other segments.

The series was taped for the CBS Television Network at its station affiliate WLAC-TV (now WTVF) in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, and later at Opryland USA in the city&#x27;s Donelson area. The show was produced by Yongestreet Productions through the mid-1980s; it was later produced by Gaylord Entertainment, which distributed the show in syndication. The show&#x27;s name, derived from a common English onomatopoeia used to describe a donkey&#x27;s braying, was coined by show-business talent manager and producer Bernie Brillstein.

The series initially ended its run in June 1993, after 25 seasons. It was soon picked up by TNN for reruns.

== Synopsis ==
&quot;Hee Haw&quot; is set in Kornfield Kounty, a rural farming community in an unspecified state in the Southern United States. The show&#x27;s sketches mostly center around visits to local businesses in the county and the offbeat characters who live and work there.

=== Recurring sketches and segments ===
Some of the most popular sketches and segments on &quot;Hee Haw&quot; included:
* &quot;PFFT! You Was Gone!&quot; – A comedic duet featured on the premiere episode. In the first few seasons, the song was performed by Archie Campbell, with Gordie Tapp joining on the chorus. In later seasons, a guest star would join Campbell (or another cast member, usually Tapp, Grandpa Jones, George Lindsey, Kenny Price, Roni Stoneman, Roy Acuff, or Dub Taylor) on the chorus, and the guest star&#x27;s name would often (but not always) be mentioned somewhere in the song&#x27;s verse prior to the chorus. On episodes that featured more than one major guest star, the sketch was repeated so that all the guest stars would have an opportunity to participate. Rarely, a surprise guest star would appear, who was not otherwise featured in the episode. Tapp or the guest star often stood with his or her back to the viewer holding a pitchfork while Campbell, or the other cast member, holding a scythe, sang the verse. At the end of the verse, Campbell or the cast member would nudge Tapp or the guest star with their elbow, as a form of slapstick timing, whereby Tapp or the guest star would then spin around to the camera to join him or her on the chorus:

:The &quot;PFFT&quot; would be done as &quot;blowing a raspberry&quot; and occasionally, the duo would break up into laughter after the &quot;PFFT&quot;, unable to finish the song; the one who got spat upon during the &quot;PFFT&quot; changed for each show. Following Campbell&#x27;s death, whole groups and even women would be part of the chorus, with regular George Lindsay often singing the verse. Occasionally, in the later years, Roni Stoneman (in her role of Ida Lee Nagger) would sometimes sing the verse. The song itself was written years earlier by Lee Roberts and recorded in 1952 by country singer Bob Newman.

* KORN News – Don Harron, as KORN radio announcer Charlie Farquharson, would humorously spoof the delivery of local news, in his own inimitable way. In later seasons, KORN became KORV. Harron had been performing the character since 1952 on Canadian television, and continued playing Farquharson in many other media venues before, during, and after &quot;Hee Haw&quot; (the fictional radio station is not to be confused with the Mitchell, South Dakota–based KORN (AM) or KORN-FM).
* Lulu&#x27;s Truck Stop – Lulu Roman owned this greasy spoon, where the food and customer service were usually pretty bad; Gailard Sartain was also in this sketch as the chef Orville, and George Lindsay often appeared in the sketch as their goofy patron.
* Hee Haw Players – Cast members take on some of the Shakespeare classics, with some unexpected twists.
* Hee Haw Amateur Minute – A showcase of some of the worst talent of all, a cast member would play some yokel who would have some kind of bad talent, which would almost always end up with the audience booing it, throwing vegetables and the hook operator yanking said act forcibly off the stage. After the sketch, animated cartoon animals appeared onscreen booing, as well.
* Samuel B. Sternwheeler – Gordie Tapp, in a spoof of author Mark Twain, gives off some homilies, which intentionally made little or no sense whatsoever. After these recitations, he most often was hit over the head with a rubber chicken, or in later years, given a bomb or something that eventually exploded, leaving him covered in soot and a shredded suit.
* Stringbean&#x27;s Letter From Home – Cast members sat around a barn porch setting, listening to Stringbean read a letter that he receives from home. The letters included stories delivered in punch line format.
* The Haystack – A male cast member and one of the &quot;Hee Haw&quot; Honeys talk about love issues while sitting at the haystack.
* Colonel Daddy&#x27;s Daughter – Marianne Gordon was the pampered Southern belle daughter of her Colonel Daddy (Gordie Tapp in his role of Samuel Sternwheeler). She sat on the swing at her plantation home, and spoke about the generosity of her Daddy. In later sketches, Tapp&#x27;s character was no longer seen, but was always referenced to by his spoiled daughter, though the later seasons had Tapp reprising his role of Samuel Sternwheeler giving romantic advice to his daughter. This sketch replaced the &quot;Samuel B. Sternwheeler&quot; sketch, which had previously been discontinued.
* The Moonshiners – Two of the male cast members, playing lethargic hillbillies, lazily told a joke while dozing on the floor near a bunch of moonshine jugs and Beauregard the Wonder Dog (Kingfish the Wonder Dog in earlier seasons, Buford the Wonder Dog in later seasons), with three or four of the &quot;Hee Haw&quot; Honeys reclining in the background. Occasionally in later seasons, the camera zoomed in on two of the reclining Honeys lazily telling the joke.
* School Scenes – School scenes were always scattered throughout the series&#x27; run. At first, it was with Jennifer Bishop and Lulu Roman as the put-upon teachers, with most notably Junior Samples and Roy Clark as the students. When Minnie Pearl became the teacher, the set was a larger classroom with, at first, real children as the students, but later returned to the cast members playing children, with Pearl still as the teacher. In the later seasons, George Lindsay, as the school bully, talked about his day in school.
* Advice to the Lovelorn – &quot;Hee Haw&quot; Honey Lisa Todd, reclining on a living room sofa, gave wacky love advice in a sultry manner and closed the sketch by winking at the camera. In later seasons of the sketch, George Lindsay, who provided the voice-over introduction in earlier seasons, now appeared on screen wearing a leisure suit, introducing the sketch.
* The Culhanes of Kornfield Kounty – The adventures of the Culhane family were depicted, as all they did was sit on an old-fashioned sofa in the parlor, which focused on Cousin Clem Culhane (Gordie Tapp), Cousin Junior Culhane (Junior Samples), Cousin Grandpa Culhane (Grandpa Jones), and Cousin Lulu Culhane (Lulu Roman), who would sit in deadpan character and comment, à la soap opera. After the death of Samples, his role was filled by cast member Mike Snider in the role of Cousin Mike.
* Pickin&#x27; and Grinnin – Musical interludes with Owens (on guitar) and Clark (on banjo) and the entire cast (Owens: ; Clark: ), with the duo (and sometimes a major guest star—such as Johnny Cash—sitting between Owens and Clark) &quot;dueling&quot; by playing guitar and banjo the instrumental to &quot;Cripple Creek&quot;, telling jokes and reciting one-liners. The sketch always ended with Clark&#x27;s banjo solo, each time ending a different comical way. For the first two the sketch featured only Clark and Owens, and in later seasons the entire cast participated. When the entire cast began participating, the sketch was introduced by the show&#x27;s emcee Cathy Baker. This sketch at first would always open the second half of the show before alternating with the &quot;Hee Haw Honky Tonk&quot; sketch in the later seasons.
* Samples Used Car Sales – Junior Samples, as a used car salesman, would try to palm off a major &quot;clunker&quot;.
* &quot;Gloom, Despair, and Agony On Me&quot; – Another popular sketch, it was usually performed by four male cast members (originally—and usually—Roy Clark; Gordie Tapp; Grandpa Jones and Archie Campbell) sitting around in hillbilly garb surrounded by moonshine jugs and looking overtly miserable. The song began with the chorus, which all of them sang with each one alternating (in lip-synch) a mournful howl after each of the first three lines. The chorus went:

:The quartet began by singing the chorus together, followed by each quartet member reciting some humorous reason for his misery in spoken form, then (in the first several seasons) the quartet reprised the chorus and end with all four sobbing in typical overstated manner.

* The Gossip Girls – This sketch is the female counterpart to &quot;Gloom, Despair...&quot;, which featured four female cast members surrounding a washtub and clothes wringer singing the chorus:

:Two of the four girls then sang the verse. Misty Rowe, a long-time member of the &quot;Gossip Girls&quot;, enhanced the comedy of the sketch by singing her part of the verse out of tune (as a young child would do). In later years, male cast members, in drag, sometimes replaced the girls in the sketch, in retaliation for the girls singing &quot;Gloom, Despair...&quot; Sometimes, in later seasons, the four female cast members sang the song on the cornfield set, with a male guest star standing in the center, between the four girls.

* &quot;Hee Haw Salutes ...&quot; – Two or three times in each episode, &quot;Hee Haw&quot; saluted a selected town (or a guest star&#x27;s hometown) and announce its population, which was sometimes altered for levity, at which point the entire cast would then &quot;pop up&quot; in the cornfield set, shouting &quot;SAA-LUTE!!&quot; Initially ending with laughter, this was changed by the mid-1970s to applause as a nod toward legitimately saluting small-town America. Also in the early 1980s, John Henry Faulk saluted a figure in American history, which received the same appropriate nodding applause. In the later seasons, the cast said &quot;Salute&quot; on the Pickin&#x27; and Grinnin&#x27; set.
* The Joke Fence – Two or three times during each show, a cast member (usually a Honey), standing in front of a high wooden fence, told a one liner joke. &quot;(&quot;Example&quot;: &quot;I crossed an elephant with a gopher.&quot; Entire cast in unison: &quot;What&#x27;ja get?&quot; &quot;Some awfully big holes in the backyard.&quot;)&quot; Regardless of whether the joke teller was female or male, a portion of the fence swung upward and hit them on the buttocks, after the punch line was delivered. (On some versions of the show, the sketch cut to the next scene just before the fence hit the cast member, and especially in earlier seasons, the sketch would freeze-frame at the moment the fence made contact with the joke teller&#x27;s buttocks.)
* Archie&#x27;s Barber Shop – Archie Campbell, as the local barber, performed with regular customer Roy Clark, and two or three other regulars sitting in the &quot;waiting chairs&quot; (on some occasions Junior Samples or a guest star would be the one going into the barber&#x27;s chair). Campbell shared comic dialog with Clark or told one of his &quot;backwards fairy tales&quot; such as &quot;Rindercella&quot;.
* Doc Campbell – This long-running sketch featured Archie Campbell playing the part of a doctor who often gave out terrible advice and bizarre medical &quot;facts&quot;. Patients often were one of the show&#x27;s cast members. The sketch is also remembered for cast member Gunilla Hutton&#x27;s role as Doc Campbell&#x27;s assistant, Nurse Goodbody.
* Justus O&#x27;Peace – This sketch featured Archie Campbell as a judge who wore what looked to be a bowler hat, a red undershirt, and suspenders, sentencing people to long jail time for some of the silliest misdemeanor &quot;crime&quot;. Kenny Price also made occasional appearances as the sheriff (in the later seasons, the sketch began with a painting of Ida Lee Nagger depicted as Lady Justice). Years later, Archie&#x27;s son, Phil Campbell, and Gordie Tapp, appeared in a recurring sketch about two police officers. They also did a courtroom sketch with Dub Taylor as the judge and Gailard Sartain in his role of Cletus Biggs from &quot;Biggs, Shy, and Stir&quot;.
* &quot;Uh-huh, Oh Yeah!&quot; – Cast member and banjo picker Buck Trent recited a comical poem, talking blues-style (usually about chickens) to his banjo instrumental.
* Hee Haw Dictionary – Archie Campbell, dressed in a graduate&#x27;s cap and gown, gave the definition of a word with a comic twist. Sometimes, wads of paper flew into the scene as a way of punishing the bad joke that was told.
* Gordie&#x27;s General Store – Gordie Tapp was the owner of a general merchandise store. It was also a place where one of the cast members (usually Junior Samples or Grandpa Jones) told a comedic story in early seasons. In later seasons, the focus shifted from Kornfield Kounty residents stopping by to the comedic banter of Tapp and Gailard Sartain, who played the role of Gordie&#x27;s incompetent employee Maynard, who often sent Tapp into fits of anger or agony by the sketch&#x27;s end.
* &quot;Real Incredible&quot; – This sketch, which ran in the early 1980s, was &quot;Hee Haw&#x27;s&quot; parody of TV&#x27;s two popular reality series that ran during that period: ABC&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Real People&quot;. Don Harron, in his role as Charlie Farquharson, hosted the sketch, comedically introducing it by transposing the shows&#x27; two titles: &quot;Welcome to Real Incredible (That&#x27;s People?!).&quot; Assisted by George Lindsay, the sketch at first showed clips of actual rural folks engaging in unusual activities, but was later spoofed by cast members involved in comical, and obviously fictional, unusual activities.
* Misty&#x27;s Bedtime Stories – This sketch featured bedtime stories delivered by cast member Misty Rowe. Grandpa Jones or George Lindsay was heard off-screen introducing the sketch in a near-whisper, &quot;And now it&#x27;s time for Misty&#x27;s Bedtime Stories.&quot; Rowe delivered one of her bizarre stories, sometimes a rewritten nursery rhyme. By the sketch&#x27;s end, she delivered a comical &quot;moral to the story&quot;, giggle, wink at the camera, and blow out the candle.
* Empty Arms Hotel – Roy Clark was the head desk clerk at one of the few accommodations in all of Kornfield Kounty, who would pop up from behind the front desk after the bell was rung, usually by a complaining guest.
* Goober&#x27;s Garage – Goober Pyle (George Lindsey carrying over his role from &quot;Mayberry RFD&quot; and &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;) was the owner of the local garage where he would talk about cars and jalopies with whoever appeared in the sketch that week. Sometimes, non-cast member Jack Burns appeared in the sketch as the city slicker/con-artist type trying to pull a fast one, with Goober emerging more intelligent. For a short time in the early 1980s, after Burns&#x27; run, Chase Randolph appeared in the sketch as a muscular &quot;hunk&quot; mechanic hired by Goober and being pursued by Honeys Diana Goodman, Misty Rowe, and Nancy Traylor. The running gag of Randolph&#x27;s run was that Randolph was more interested in fixing up his hot rod than giving in to the advances of the girls, while Goober then offered to go out with the girls, instead—only to strike out miserably. In later seasons, after Randolph&#x27;s run, Goober was joined in the sketch by Goodman, Rowe, and Lisa Todd as his beautiful but not very bright mechanics.
* The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter – Cast member Linda Thompson was the daughter of a strict farmer (cast member Kenny Price). The running gag in the sketch was that Price always came up with clever ways to thwart Thompson&#x27;s dates with her boyfriend Billy Bob.
* The Weather Girl – A spin-off of &quot;KORN News&quot;, &quot;Hee Haw&quot; Honey Lisa Todd spoofed the weather forecast. Grandpa Jones appeared with Todd and she determined the forecast according to the condition of Jones&#x27; knee. In later seasons, Gailard Sartain appeared in the sketch as a &quot;human weather map&quot;, at first wearing a sweatshirt with a map outline of the United States before transitioning to an inflated globe costume. The running gag during Sartain&#x27;s run was that Sartain chased Todd off the set by the sketch&#x27;s end.
:&quot;(In later seasons, &quot;KORN News&quot; and &quot;The Weather Girl&quot; merged into one sketch, and Misty Rowe later joined the sketch spoofing local sports news.)&quot;
* &quot;Hee Haw&#x27;s All-Jug Band&quot; – A musical sketch, it featured most of the female cast members, singing a comical song, in which the punch line differed each week. Cast member Lulu Roman &quot;played&quot; moonshine jugs (by which, she would blow air over the spout, creating a &quot;humming sound&quot;), which partially explains the sketch&#x27;s title (as well as the fact that &quot;jugs&quot; is a dysphemism for breasts). Minnie Pearl introduced the sketch each week, loudly announcing, &quot;We&#x27;re gonna play now!&quot; At the end of the song, she similarly concluded, &quot;We&#x27;re through playin&#x27; now!&quot;
* &quot;Hey Grandpa! What&#x27;s For Supper?&quot; – Grandpa Jones is cleaning a window pane (with no glass in it, as evidenced by Jones&#x27; hand dangling through the window pane as he recites the menu) and when the entire cast (off-camera) asks, &quot;Hey, Grandpa, what&#x27;s for supper?&quot;, he recites a dinner menu in poetic verse. Often, he describes a delicious, country-style meal (e.g., chicken and biscuits smothered in rich gravy, and collard greens), and the cast would reply approvingly, &quot;Yum-m yum-m!&quot; Sometimes, he served a less than spectacular meal &quot;(thawed out TV dinners)&quot;, to which the cast would reply, &quot;Yuck!&quot; One notable run-through of the routine had Grandpa saying, &quot;Ah ain&#x27;t got nuthin&#x27;,&quot; which was one of the few times he ever got booed during this routine. The second time was when he offered &quot;a big fresh roast of good moose meat.&quot; In the later seasons, Grandpa wore a chef&#x27;s hat with his head peeking out of an open kitchen doorway, but the menu recitals remained the same.
* Grandpa and Minnie&#x27;s Kitchen – This sketch, which ran throughout most of the 1970s, spoofed TV cooking shows in which Grandpa Jones and Minnie Pearl delivered hilarious recipes that made no sense.
* Jerry Ralph R.B. &quot;Bob&quot; Bevis – This sketch appeared mostly in the 1980s, and featured Gailard Sartain as the owner of a small store/flea market attempting to sell junk. The sketch started with a hand-held camera zooming up to the front door and the door being flung open to reveal the fast-talking salesman standing behind the counter surrounded by the junk he was trying to sell. The character was a clown with red cheeks and wild, clown-like hair. The running joke was his attempts at becoming a big singing star, and at the end of every sketch, just as he is preparing to pull out a guitar and starting to sing, the camera zoomed out and the door swung shut.
* Biggs, Shy, &amp; Stir – This featured Gailard Sartain as &quot;Cletus Biggs of Biggs, Shy, &amp; Stir,&quot; Kornfield Kounty&#x27;s most honorable law firm, where our motto is, &#x27;When in doubt, sue!&#x27;&quot; He advertised the week&#x27;s &quot;special&quot; such as &quot;Sue Your Parents Week&quot; or &quot;Sue Your Teacher Week&quot;. He always concluded the sketch by saying, &quot;Remember, we&#x27;re in the alley behind the courthouse above the pool hall!&quot;
* The Cornfield – Vignettes patterned after &quot;Laugh-In&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Joke Wall&quot;, it had cast members and guest stars &quot;popping up&quot; to tell jokes and one-liners. Until his death, Stringbean played the field&#x27;s scarecrow, delivering one-liners before being shouted down by the crow on his shoulder; after his 1973 murder, Stringbean was not replaced, and a wooden scarecrow was simply seen in the field as a memorial. Guest stars often participated in this sketch, as well; on occasion, personalities from TV stations that carried &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, as well as country-music radio personalities, appeared in this sketch with Owens or Clark.
* The Naggers – This sketch featured Gordie Tapp and Roni Stoneman as LaVern and Ida Lee Nagger, a backwoods bickering couple, inspired in part by the radio comedy &quot;The Bickersons&quot;. Kenny Price made occasional appearances (starting in 1974) as their son Elrod; Wendy Suits of the show&#x27;s background singing group, the Nashville Edition, sometimes played Ida Lee&#x27;s equally (and deaf) nagging mother.
* Kornfield Kounty Operator Assistance – Irlene Mandrell, as Kornfield Kounty&#x27;s telephone operator (similar to Lily Tomlin&#x27;s more famous character, Ernestine Tomlin), answered phone calls from various Kornfield Kounty residents, who would eventually hang up in various degrees of frustration, causing operator Mandrell to often say, innocently, &quot;And they wonder why we telephone operators turn gray!&quot;
* Grinder&#x27;s Switch Gazette – This sketch featured Minnie Pearl as the manager of the local newspaper, who often insisted that her mute secretary, Miss Honeydew (Victoria Hallman), take down an &quot;important&quot; news item, which was always nonsense.
* About 200 Years Ago – This sketch, which ran in 1976 in celebration of the bicentennial year, was a parody of CBS&#x27; &quot;Bicentennial Minutes&quot;; in the sketch, Grandpa Jones delivered a fractured historical &quot;fact&quot; about the Revolutionary War era. Jones then concluded the sketch with a knockoff of Walter Cronkite&#x27;s signature signoff line, &quot;I&#x27;m Grandpa Jones and that&#x27;s the way it was, 200 years ago...er, more or less.&quot;
* The Almanac – A sketch that ran in the late 1970s, Grandpa Jones delivered almanac entries that made no sense. Jones then concluded the sketch with a knockoff of the proverb &quot;truth is stranger than fiction&quot;, with Jones replacing the word &quot;fiction&quot; with the name of a well-known celebrity.
* Archie&#x27;s Angels – Aired in the mid-1970s, this sketch was &quot;Hee Haw&#x27;s&quot; knockoff of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, the popular TV crime show from that period. Three of the Honeys portrayed the Angels, with Archie Campbell&#x27;s voice giving them humorous &quot;assignments&quot; over an intercom, as with the actual &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; TV show.
* &quot;Let&#x27;s Truck Together&quot; – This sketch reflected the CB radio craze during the mid- to late 1970s. Kenny Price and Gailard Sartain, as truck drivers, swapped funny stories and one-liners with each other over the CB airwaves.
* Hee Haw Honky Tonk – With the &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; craze in full swing in the early 1980s, &quot;Hee Haw&quot; answered with its very own &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;-esque honky-tonk (even Buck Owens developed an &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; look by growing a beard and donning a cowboy hat, and kept this image for the next several seasons). The sketch was a spinoff of &quot;Pickin&#x27; and Grinnin&#x27;&quot; with cast members, as patrons of the honky tonk, throwing out one-liners between parts of the &quot;Hee Haw Honky Tonk&quot; song. The honky tonk was replete with its mechanical bull, and also included a background conversation track during the one-liners to add to the realism of an actual nightclub. The sketch also at times featured Roni Stoneman, in her role of Ida Lee Nagger, chasing men with a net. The sketch was also patterned after the party on &quot;Laugh-In&quot;. The &quot;Hee Haw Honky Tonk&quot; set also became the main stage for most of the musical performances for the rest of the series&#x27; run.
* Kurl Up and Dye – This sketch from the show&#x27;s later years featured several of the cast members in a beauty parlor where they could gossip. From time to time, Gailard Sartain appeared in drag as one of the fussy women.
* Fit as a Fiddle – This sketch ran in the 1980s to reflect the aerobic-dancing craze of that period. The sketch featured several of the cast members, including Diana Goodman, Victoria Hallman, Gunilla Hutton, Misty Rowe, Nancy Traylor, Linda Thompson, Jeff Smith, Jackie Waddell, and Kelly Billingsey, delivering one-liner jokes while aerobic dancing. Sometimes, cast member Smith (later Roni Stoneman) was seen on an exercise cycle in the background.
* Slim Pickens&#x27; Bar-B-Q – Slim Pickens had his friends over at a barbecue at his home, where a musical guest or cast members would perform. The segment always opened by spoofing Burma Shave road signs, as some of the cast members were seen piled on a truck driving down the road to Slim Pickens&#x27; Bar-B-Q, whose guests often complained about the food, to which Pickens countered with something like, &quot;I may not have prime meat at this picnic, but I do have prime entertainment!&quot; Then, he brought out the entertainment (the guest star&#x27;s or cast members&#x27; performance).
* The Post Office – Minnie Pearl and Grandpa Jones ran the post office, often dealing with (mostly) unhappy customers.
* The Quilt – Minnie Pearl gave romantic advice to several of the &quot;Hee Haw &quot;Honeys while sitting around in a circle, making a quilt.
* Knock Knock – Buck Owens told a knock-knock joke to an unsuspecting cast member or guest star. If the guest star were a major country artist, the joke would be written to reveal the punch-line answer to be the title to one of the singer&#x27;s biggest hits, which Owens then sang badly on purpose.
* The Hambone Brothers – Jackie Phelps did some rhythmic knee-slapping (known as hambone), while Jimmy Riddle eefed.
* Stories from John Henry Faulk and Rev. Grady Nutt – Beginning in the late 1970s, John Henry Faulk, followed in later seasons by Rev. Grady Nutt, sat around in a circle with some of the male cast members on the set of Gordie&#x27;s General Store telling some of their humorous stories (very much in the same manner Grandpa Jones and Junior Samples did in the early seasons). At the beginning of Grady Nutt&#x27;s sketches, Grandpa Jones introduced Nutt as &quot;&quot;Hee Haw&#x27;s&quot; very own Prime Minister of Humor.&quot; These sketches discontinued after Nutt&#x27;s death in a plane crash in 1982.
* Ben Colder – A singer of cheesy parodies of popular country songs, Sheb Wooley had created the character before the show began and portrayed the character during his time on the show and his guest appearances.
* Claude Strawberry, Country Poet – Roy Clark played a poet reminiscent of Mark Twain, who would recite poems with a country twist.
* The Little Yellow Chicken – An animated little yellow chicken always mistook anything and everything for an egg. The chicken would sit on items, such as a ringside bell, a man&#x27;s bald head, a billiard ball, a football, a golf ball and even a bomb, with various disastrous results. The little chicken was produced by Format Films.
* Animated Critters – Interspersed within the show, besides the above-mentioned chicken, were various applauding or laughing animated farm animals; a kickline composed of pigs during an instrumental performance; a pack of dogs that chased an extremely bad joke teller; three sultry pigs that twirled their necklaces during an instrumental performance; a square-dancing female pig and a male donkey to an instrumental performance; a pair of chickens dancing, with one of them falling flat on its face; the ubiquitous &quot;Hee Haw&quot; donkey, that would say quips such as, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t that dunk your hat in the creek&quot;, and a pig (from the kickline) that would sneak up on a musical guest (or a cast member, mostly Roy Clark), kiss him on the cheek, and sneak off after his performance. Sometimes, certain animals carried appropriate signs with some kind of quip (e.g. the&quot; Hee Haw &quot;donkey holding a sign that said, &quot;I&#x27;m looking for a &quot;She-Haw!&quot; or in later years, &quot;Let us Bray!&quot;).

Guest stars often participated in some of the sketches (mostly the &quot;PFFT! You Was Gone&quot; and &quot;The Cornfield&quot; sketches); however, this did not occur until later seasons.

== Cast ==
Two rural-style comedians, already well known in their native Canada, Gordie Tapp and Don Harron (whose KORN Radio character, newscaster Charlie Farquharson, had been a fixture of Canadian television since 1952 and later appeared on &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;), gained their first major U.S. exposure on &quot;Hee Haw&quot;.

The Buckaroos (Buck Owens&#x27; band) initially served as the house band on the show and consisted of members Don Rich, Jim Shaw, Jerry Brightman, Jerry Wiggins, Rick Taylor, Doyle Singer (Doyle Curtsinger), Don Lee, Ronnie Jackson, Terry Christoffersen, Doyle Holly and, in later seasons, fiddle player Jana Jae and Victoria Hallman, who replaced Don Rich on harmony vocals (Rich was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1974). In later seasons, the show hired Nashville musicians to serve as the show&#x27;s &quot;house band.&quot; George Richey was the first music director. When he left to marry Tammy Wynette, harmonica player Charlie McCoy, already a member of the band when he was not playing on recording sessions, became the show&#x27;s music director, forming the &quot;Hee Haw Band&quot;, which became the house band for the remainder of the series&#x27; run. The Nashville Edition, a singing quartet consisting of two males and two females, served as the background singers for most of the musical performances, along with performing songs on their own.

Some of the cast members made national headlines: Lulu Roman was twice charged with drug possession in 1971; David &quot;Stringbean&quot; Akeman and his wife were murdered in November 1973 during a robbery at their home; Slim Pickens, less than two years after joining the series, was diagnosed with a fatal brain tumor, and, as mentioned above, Don Rich of the Buckaroos was killed in a motorcycle crash in 1974.

Some cast members, such as Charlie McCoy and Tennessee Ernie Ford, originally appeared on the show as guest stars; while Barbi Benton and Sheb Wooley returned in later seasons only as guest stars.

After Buck Owens left the show, a different country music artist would accompany Roy Clark as a guest co-host each week, who would give the episode&#x27;s opening performance, participate with Clark in the &quot;Pickin&#x27; and Grinnin&#x27;&quot; sketch, and assist Clark in introducing the other guest stars&#x27; performances. The show&#x27;s final season (&quot;Hee Haw Silver&quot;) was hosted by Clark alone.

=== Guest stars ===
&quot;Hee Haw&quot; featured at least two, and sometimes three or four, guest celebrities each week. While most of the guest stars were country music artists, a wide range of other famous luminaries were featured from actors and actresses to sports stars to politicians.

Sheb Wooley, one of the original cast members, wrote the show&#x27;s theme song. After filming the initial 13 episodes, other professional demands caused him to leave the show, but he returned from time to time as a guest star.

Loretta Lynn was the first guest star of &quot;Hee Haw&quot; and made more guest appearances (24) than any other artist. She also co-hosted the show more than any other guest co-host and therefore appears on more of the DVD releases for retail sale than any other guest star. Tammy Wynette was second with 21 guest appearances, and Wynette married George Richey (the musical director for &quot;Hee Haw&quot; from 1970 to 1977) in 1978.

From 1990 to 1992, country megastar Garth Brooks appeared on the show four times. In 1992, producer Sam Lovullo tried unsuccessfully to contact Brooks because he wanted him for the final show. Brooks then surprised Lovullo by showing up at the last minute, ready to don his overalls and perform for the final episode.

=== Elvis connection ===
Elvis Presley was a fan of &quot;Hee Haw&quot; and wanted to appear as a guest on the program, but Presley knew his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, would not allow him to do so (following Presley&#x27;s death, Parker would be sued by Elvis Presley Enterprises for mismanagement). Two of the Hee Haw Honeys dated Presley long before they joined the cast: Linda Thompson in the mid-1970s, with whom Presley had a long-term relationship after his divorce from Priscilla; and Diana Goodman shortly afterwards. Charlie McCoy played harmonica on a select few of Presley&#x27;s recordings in the late 1960s, Joe Babcock of the Nashville Edition also sang backup vocals on a couple of his recordings at that time, and the Nashville Edition sang backup on Presley&#x27;s recording of &quot;Early Morning Rain.&quot; Shortly after Presley&#x27;s death, his father, Vernon Presley, made a cameo appearance on the show, alongside Thompson and Buck Owens, and paid tribute to his late son, noting how much Elvis enjoyed watching the show, and introduced one of his favorite gospel songs, which was performed by the Hee Haw Gospel Quartet.

== Production ==
=== Creation ===
&quot;Hee Haw&#x27;s&quot; creators, Frank Peppiatt and John Aylesworth, were both Canadian-born writers who had extensive experience in writing for variety shows. Inspired by the enormous prior success of rural sitcoms of the 1960s, especially on CBS, which included the small-town sympathetic &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, followed by the country-parodying &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; and &quot;Green Acres&quot;, Peppiatt and Aylesworth sought to create a variety show catering to the same audience—although neither one had a firm grasp on rural comedy.

The producers selected a pair of hosts who represented each side in a divide in country/western music at the time: Buck Owens was a prominent architect of the California-based Bakersfield sound and one of the biggest country hitmakers of the 1960s. Roy Clark, who had worked in Washington, D.C., and Las Vegas, was a stalwart of Nashville&#x27;s Music Row known for his skill at mixing music and comedy onstage. Both Clark and Owens had been regular guests on &quot;The Jimmy Dean Show&quot; during Peppiatt and Aylesworth&#x27;s time writing for that series. Peppiatt and Aylesworth brought on two fellow Canadian writers with more experience in rural humor, Gordie Tapp and Don Harron; Harron would appear in the recurring role of &quot;Charlie Farquharson&quot;, the rural anchorman for station KORN. The producers also scored a country comedy expert familiar to rural audiences in Archie Campbell, who co-starred in and wrote many of the jokes and sketches, along with Tapp, George Yanok and comedian Jack Burns (who himself had briefly replaced Don Knotts on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;) in the first season.

=== Stage settings ===
A barn interior set was used as the main stage for most of the musical performances from the show&#x27;s premiere until the debut of the &quot;Hee Haw Honky Tonk&quot; sketch in the early 1980s. Afterwards, the &quot;Hee Haw Honky Tonk&quot; set would serve as the main stage for the remainder of the series&#x27; run. Buck Owens then began using the barn interior set for his performances after it was replaced by the &quot;Hee Haw Honky Tonk&quot; set and was named &quot;Buck&#x27;s Place&quot; (as a nod to one of Owens&#x27; hits, &quot;Sam&#x27;s Place&quot;). Other settings for the musical performances throughout the series&#x27; run included a haystack (where the entire cast performed songs), the living room of a Victorian house, the front porch and lawn of the Samuel B. Sternwheeler home, a grist mill (where Roy Clark performed many of his songs in earlier seasons), and a railroad depot, where Buck Owens performed his songs before acquiring &quot;Buck&#x27;s Place.&quot;

=== Music ===
&quot;Hee Haw&quot; featured a premiere showcase on commercial television throughout its run for country, bluegrass, gospel, and other styles of American traditional music, featuring hundreds of elite musical performances that were paramount to the success, popularity and legacy of the series for a broad audience of Southern, rural and purely music fans alike. Although country music was the primary genre of music featured on the show, guest stars and cast members alike also performed music from other genres, such as rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll oldies, big band, and pop standards.

Some of the music-based segments on the show (other than guest stars&#x27; performances) included:
* The Million Dollar Band – This was an instrumental band formed of legendary Nashville musicians Chet Atkins (guitar), Boots Randolph (saxophone), Roy Clark (guitar), Floyd Cramer (piano), Charlie McCoy (harmonica), Danny Davis (trumpet), Jethro Burns (mandolin), Johnny Gimble (fiddle), backed by a rhythm section consisting of Nashville session super pickers Willie Ackerman (drums), Henry Strzelecki (Bass) and Bobby Thompson (banjo/acoustic guitar); who would frequently appear on the show from 1980 through 1988. The band would perform an instrumental version of a popular song, with each member showcasing his talent on his respective instrument.
* The Hee Haw Gospel Quartet – Beginning in the latter part of the 1970s, this group sang a gospel hymn just before the show&#x27;s closing. The original lineup consisted of Buck Owens (lead), Roy Clark (tenor), Grandpa Jones (baritone), and Tennessee Ernie Ford (bass). Ford was later replaced by Kenny Price. In contrast to &quot;Hee Haw&#x27;s&quot; general levity, the Quartet&#x27;s performance was appropriately treated solemnly, with no laughter or applause from the audience. Jones did not wear his signature hat during the segment, and would frequently appear entirely out of his &quot;Grandpa&quot; costume. In the first few seasons that featured the Quartet, cast member Lulu Roman would introduce the group along with the hymn they were about to perform. Several of the Quartet&#x27;s performances were released as recordings. Joe Babcock took over as lead singer after Owens left the show, and Ray Burdette took over as bass singer after the death of Kenny Price; but the Quartet was not featured as often from that point on. However, the show still closed with a gospel song—if not by the Quartet, then by either the entire cast, a guest gospel artist, or cast member Lulu Roman (a gospel artist in her own right). The concept of the Quartet was based on the 1940s group the Brown&#x27;s Ferry Four, which recorded for King Records and included Grandpa Jones, the Delmore Brothers and Merle Travis. Jones suggested the idea to the show&#x27;s producers, supported by Clark.
* The Hagers – This twin brother singing duo would also perform a song each week on the show. They would often perform their own versions of pop/rock songs from the 1960s and 1970s.
* Performances by cast members – In addition to hosts Buck Owens and Roy Clark, who would perform at least one song each week, other cast members—such as Gunilla Hutton, Misty Rowe, Victoria Hallman, Grandpa Jones (sometimes with his wife Ramona), Kenny Price, Archie Campbell, Barbi Benton, The Nashville Edition, Vicki Bird, and Diana Goodman—would occasionally perform a song on the show; and the show would almost always open with a song performed by the entire cast.
* The Hee Haw Cowboy Quartet – This group, patterned after the Hee Haw Gospel Quartet, was short-lived, having formed near the end of the series&#x27; run. Like the group name suggests; the quartet, dressed in cowboy costumes, would perform a western song in the style of the Sons of the Pioneers on a Western-style stage setting.
* Cloggers – Throughout the 1980s, several champion clogging groups would frequently appear on the show, performing their clogging routines.
* Child singers – For a brief time in the late 1970s/early 1980s, child singers, mostly in the 10- to 12-year-old bracket, would occasionally appear on the show performing a popular song. Such guests included Kathy Kitchen (whom guest star Faron Young introduced), Stacy Lynn Ries, and Cheryl Handy.

Lovullo also has made the claim the show presented &quot;what were, in reality, the first musical videos.&quot; Lovullo said his videos were conceptualized by having the show&#x27;s staff go to nearby rural areas and film animals and farmers, before editing the footage to fit the storyline of a particular song. , he wrote. The concept&#x27;s mixed reaction eventually spelled an end to the &quot;video&quot; concept on &quot;Hee Haw&quot;. However, several of co-host Owens&#x27; songs—including &quot;Tall, Dark Stranger&quot;, &quot;Big in Vegas&quot;, and &quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Live in New York City (If They Gave Me the Whole Dang Town)&quot;—aired on the series and have since aired on Great American Country and CMT as part of their classic country music programming blocks.

== Release ==
=== Broadcast ===
&quot;Hee Haw&quot; premiered on CBS on June 15, 1969, as a summer series. The show played to the rural routes of its humor with the producers arranging with the network to have the show segments recorded and edited in Nashville at CBS affiliate WLAC-TV (now WTVF). The network picked it up as a last-minute replacement for &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, a popular but controversial variety show that had been canceled amid feuds between the Smothers Brothers and the network censors over the show&#x27;s topical humor.

Though &quot;Hee Haw&quot; had solid ratings overall (it sat at No. 16 for the 1970–71 season), it was dropped in July 1971 by CBS as part of the so-called &quot;Rural Purge&quot; that abruptly canceled all of the network&#x27;s country-themed shows, including those with still-respectable ratings. The success of shows like &quot;Hee Haw&quot; was the source of a heated dispute in CBS&#x27;s corporate offices: Vice President of network programming Michael Dann, although he personally disliked the shows, argued in favor of ratings (reflecting audience size), while his subordinate, Fred Silverman, head of daytime programming, held that certain demographics within total television viewership—in which &quot;Hee Haw&quot; and the others performed poorly—could draw more advertising dollars. Silverman&#x27;s view won out, Dann was fired, Silverman promoted, and CBS canceled its rural shows in the summer of 1971.

=== Syndication ===
Undaunted, and noting that one instigating factor for the rural purge—the Prime Time Access Rule—had opened up an opportunity for independent syndicated productions, &quot;Hee Haw&#x27;s&quot; producers put together a syndication deal for the show, which continued in roughly the same format for the rest of its run. Peppiatt and Aylesworth&#x27;s company, Yongestreet Productions (named for Yonge Street, a prominent thoroughfare in their home city of Toronto), maintained ownership of the series.

At its peak, &quot;Hee Haw&quot; often competed in syndication against &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;, a long-running ABC program which had likewise been canceled in 1971, in its case in a purge of the networks&#x27; older demographic-leaning programs. Like &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, &quot;Lawrence Welk&quot; was picked up for syndication in the fall of 1971, in some markets by the same stations. The success of the two shows in syndication, and the network decisions that led to their respective cancellations, were the inspiration for a novelty song, &quot;The Lawrence Welk-Hee Haw Counter-Revolution Polka&quot;, performed by Clark; it rose to become a top 10 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart in the fall of 1972.

&quot;Welk&quot; and &quot;Hee Haw&quot; also competed against another music-oriented niche program that moved to syndication in 1971, &quot;Soul Train&quot;. Originally a local program based in Chicago, the black-oriented program also went on to a very long run in syndication; unlike either program, &quot;Soul Train&quot; entered the market after achieving success at the local level.

In 1981, Yongestreet was acquired by Gaylord Entertainment (best known for the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; and its related businesses). Mirroring the long downward trend in the popularity of variety shows in general that had taken place in the 1970s, ratings began to decline for &quot;Hee Haw&quot; around 1986. That year, Owens departed as host, leaving Clark to continue with a celebrity guest host each week. The ratings decline continued into the early 1990s. In the fall of 1991, in an attempt to win back viewers, attract a younger audience, and keep pace with sweeping changes in the country music industry of the era, the show&#x27;s format and setting underwent a dramatic overhaul. The changes included a new title (&quot;The Hee Haw Show&quot;), more pop-oriented country music, and the barnyard-cornfield setting replaced by a city street and shopping mall set. The first of the new episodes aired in January 1992. The changes alienated many of the show&#x27;s longtime viewers while failing to gain the hoped-for younger viewers, and the ratings continued their decline.

During the summer of 1992, a decision was made to end first-run production, and instead air highlights of the show&#x27;s earlier years in a revamped program called &quot;Hee Haw Silver&quot; (as part of celebrating the show&#x27;s 25th season). Under the new format, Clark hosted a mixture of classic clips and new footage.

&quot;Hee Haw Silver&quot; episodes also aired a series of retrospective looks at performers who had died since performing in highlighted content, such as David &quot;Stringbean&quot; Akeman, Archie Campbell, Junior Samples, and Kenny Price. According to the show&#x27;s producer, Sam Lovullo, the ratings showed improvement with these classic reruns; however, the series was finally canceled in June 1993 at the conclusion of its 25th season. &quot;Hee Haw&quot; continued to pop up in reruns throughout the 1990s and later during the following decade in a series of successful DVD releases from Time Life.

=== Reruns ===
After the show&#x27;s syndication run ended, reruns aired on The Nashville Network from 1993 until 1995. Upon the cancellation of reruns in 1995, the program resurfaced a year later, for another run of reruns, ultimately concluding in 1997. Its 22 years in TV syndication (1971–93) was, during its latter years, tied with &quot;Soul Train&quot; with the record for the longest-running American syndicated TV program (&quot;Soul Train&quot; continued until 2006); &quot;Hee Haw&quot; has fallen well behind several other American first-run syndicated shows since then.

During the 2006–07 season CMT aired a series of reruns and TV Land also recognized the series with an award presented by k.d. lang; in attendance were Roy Clark, Gunilla Hutton, Barbi Benton, the Hager twins, Linda Thompson, Misty Rowe, and others. It was during this point, roughly between the years of 2004 and 2007, that Time Life began selling selected episodes of the show on DVD. Among the DVD content offered was the 1978 10th anniversary special that had not been seen since its original airing. CMT sporadically aired the series, usually in graveyard slots, and primarily held the rights in order to be able to air the musical performances as part of their music video library (such as during the &quot;Pure Vintage&quot; block on CMT Pure Country).

Reruns of &quot;Hee Haw&quot; began airing on RFD-TV in September 2008, where it ran for 12 years, anchoring the network&#x27;s Sunday night lineup, although beginning in January 2014 an episode airs on Saturday afternoon and the same episode is rerun the following Sunday night; those episodes were cut down to comply with the 44-minute minimum. In 2011, the network began re-airing the earliest episodes from 1969 to 1970 on Thursday evenings. That summer, many of the surviving cast members, along with a number of country artists who were guest stars on the show, taped a &quot;Country&#x27;s Family Reunion&quot; special, entitled &quot;Salute to the Kornfield&quot;, which aired on RFD-TV in January 2012. The special is also part of &quot;Country&#x27;s Family Reunion&quot;″s DVD series. Concurrent with the special was the unveiling of a &quot;Hee Haw&quot; exhibit, titled &quot;Pickin&#x27; and Grinnin&#x27; &quot;, at the Oklahoma History Center in Oklahoma City.

&quot;Hee Haw&quot; left RFD-TV in 2020 and then aired on the Grand Ole Opry-operated Circle network.
In 2024, the RFD-TV / RuralTV network picked up &quot;Hee Haw&quot; for their &quot;NEW SATURDAY NIGHT LINEUP&quot;. Starting Saturday, May 25, 2024, the new broadcast resumed at the 1981–1982 Season, where they previously left off.

As part of the promotions for its DVD products, Time-Life also compiles and syndicates a half-hour clip show series &quot;The Hee Haw Collection&quot;.

== Reception ==
=== Nielsen ratings ===

When &quot;Hee Haw&quot; went into syndication, many stations aired the program on Saturday evening in the early fringe hour, generally at 7:00pm ET / PT. But as &quot;Hee Haw&quot; was syndicated and not restrained by the scheduling of a network, stations could schedule the program at any day or time that they saw fit.

=== Legacy ===
&quot;Hee Haw&quot; continues to remain popular with its long-time fans and younger viewers who have discovered the program through DVD releases or its reruns through the years on TNN, CMT, RFD-TV, and now Circle TV. In spite of the popularity among its fans, the program has never been a favorite of television critics or reviewers; the &quot;Hee Haw Honeys&quot; spin-off, in particular, was cited in a 2002 &quot;TV Guide&quot; article as one of the 10 worst television series ever.

=== In popular culture ===
In the third-season episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Colonel Homer&quot;, &quot;Hee Haw&quot; is parodied as the TV show &quot;Ya Hoo!&quot;.

On at least four episodes of the animated Fox series &quot;Family Guy&quot;, when the storyline hits a dead-end, a cutaway to Conway Twitty performing a song is inserted. The hand-off is done in &quot;Hee Haw&quot; style, and often uses actual footage of Twitty performing on the show.

Lulu Roman released a new album titled &quot;At Last&quot; on January 15, 2013. The album features Lulu&#x27;s versions of 12 classics and standards, including guest appearances by Dolly Parton, T. Graham Brown, Linda Davis, and Georgette Jones (daughter of George Jones and Tammy Wynette).

The series was referenced in &quot;The Critic&quot; as a parody crossover with &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; under the title of &quot;Hee Haw: The Next Generation&quot;, where the characters of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series act out as the cast of &quot;Hee Haw&quot;.

=== &quot;Hee Haw Honeys&quot; (spin-off series) ===
&quot;Hee Haw&quot; produced a short-lived spin-off series, &quot;Hee Haw Honeys&quot;, for the 1978–79 television season. This musical sitcom starred Kathie Lee Johnson (Gifford) along with &quot;Hee Haw&quot; regulars Misty Rowe, Gailard Sartain, Lulu Roman, and Kenny Price as a family who owned a truck stop restaurant (likely inspired by the &quot;Lulu&#x27;s Truck Stop&quot; sketch on &quot;Hee Haw&quot;). Their restaurant included a bandstand, where guest country artists would perform a couple of their hits of the day, sometimes asking the cast to join them. Cast members would also perform songs occasionally; and the Nashville Edition, &quot;Hee Haw&#x27;s&quot; backup singing group, frequently appeared on the show, portraying regular patrons of the restaurant. Notable guest stars on &quot;Honeys&quot; included, but were not limited to: Loretta Lynn, The Oak Ridge Boys, Larry Gatlin, Dave &amp; Sugar, and the Kendalls. Some stations that carried &quot;Hee Haw&quot; would air an episode of &quot;Honeys&quot; prior to &quot;Hee Haw&quot;.

=== Hee Haw Theater ===
The Hee Haw Theater opened in Branson, Missouri in 1981 and operated through 1983. It featured live shows using the cast of the television series, as well as guests and other talent. The format was similar with a country variety show-type family theme.

=== Comic book adaptations ===
Charlton Comics also published humor comics based on &quot;Hee Haw&quot;. They were drawn by Frank Roberge.

<doc id="13263" wikidata="Q82828" url="?curid=13263" title="Hexadecimal">
<text>Hexadecimal (also known as base-16 or simply hex) is a positional numeral system that represents numbers using a radix (base) of sixteen. Unlike the decimal system representing numbers using ten symbols, hexadecimal uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols &quot;0&quot;–&quot;9&quot; to represent values 0 to 9 and &quot;A&quot;–&quot;F&quot; to represent values from ten to fifteen.

Software developers and system designers widely use hexadecimal numbers because they provide a convenient representation of binary-coded values. Each hexadecimal digit represents four bits (binary digits), also known as a nibble (or nybble). For example, an 8-bit byte is two hexadecimal digits and its value can be written as to in hexadecimal.

In mathematics, a subscript is typically used to specify the base. For example, the decimal value would be expressed in hexadecimal as . In programming, several notations denote hexadecimal numbers, usually involving a prefix. The prefix codice_1 is used in C, which would denote this value as codice_1.

Hexadecimal is used in the transfer encoding Base 16, in which each byte of the plain text is broken into two 4-bit values and represented by two hexadecimal digits.

==Representation==

===Written representation===

In most current use cases, the letters A–F or a–f represent the values 10–15, while the numerals 0–9 are used to represent their decimal values.

There is no universal convention to use lowercase or uppercase, so each is prevalent or preferred in particular environments by community standards or convention; even mixed case is used. Some seven-segment displays use mixed-case &#x27;A b C d E F&#x27; to distinguish the digits A–F from one another and from 0–9.

There is some standardization of using spaces (rather than commas or another punctuation mark) to separate hex values in a long list. For instance, in the following hex dump, each 8-bit byte is a 2-digit hex number, with spaces between them, while the 32-bit offset at the start is an 8-digit hex number.

00000000 57 69 6b 69 70 65 64 69 61 2c 20 74 68 65 20 66 
00000010 72 65 65 20 65 6e 63 79 63 6c 6f 70 65 64 69 61 
00000020 20 74 68 61 74 20 61 6e 79 6f 6e 65 20 63 61 6e 
00000030 20 65 64 69 74 0a 
====Distinguishing from decimal====
In contexts where the base is not clear, hexadecimal numbers can be ambiguous and confused with numbers expressed in other bases. There are several conventions for expressing values unambiguously. A numerical subscript (itself written in decimal) can give the base explicitly: 15910 is decimal 159; 15916 is hexadecimal 159, which equals 34510. Some authors prefer a text subscript, such as 159decimal and 159hex, or 159d and 159h.

Donald Knuth introduced the use of a particular typeface to represent a particular radix in his book &quot;The TeXbook&quot;. Hexadecimal representations are written there in a typewriter typeface: , 

In linear text systems, such as those used in most computer programming environments, a variety of methods have arisen:
* Although best known from the C programming language (and the many languages influenced by C), the prefix codice_1 to indicate a hex constant may have had origins in the IBM Stretch systems. It is derived from the codice_4 prefix already in use for octal constants. Byte values can be expressed in hexadecimal with the prefix codice_5 followed by two hex digits: codice_6 represents the Esc control character; codice_7 is a string containing 11 characters with two embedded Esc characters. To output an integer as hexadecimal with the printf function family, the format conversion code codice_8 or codice_9 is used.
* In XML and XHTML, characters can be expressed as hexadecimal numeric character references using the notation codice_10, for instance codice_11 represents the character U+0054 (the uppercase letter &quot;T&quot;). If there is no the number is decimal (thus codice_12 is the same character).
* In Intel-derived assembly languages and Modula-2, hexadecimal is denoted with a suffixed or : codice_13 or codice_14. Some implementations require a leading zero when the first hexadecimal digit character is not a decimal digit, so one would write codice_15 instead of codice_13. Some other implementations (such as NASM) allow C-style numbers (codice_17).
* Other assembly languages (6502, Motorola), Pascal, Delphi, some versions of BASIC (Commodore), GameMaker Language, Godot and Forth use codice_18 as a prefix: codice_19, codice_20.
* Some assembly languages (Microchip) use the notation codice_21 (for ABCD16). Similarly, Fortran 95 uses Z&#x27;ABCD&#x27;.
* Ada and VHDL enclose hexadecimal numerals in based &quot;numeric quotes&quot;: codice_22, codice_23. For bit vector constants VHDL uses the notation codice_24, codice_25.
* Verilog represents hexadecimal constants in the form codice_26, where 8 is the number of bits in the value and FF is the hexadecimal constant.
* The Icon and Smalltalk languages use the prefix codice_27: codice_28
* PostScript and the Bourne shell and its derivatives denote hex with prefix codice_29: codice_30, codice_31.
* Common Lisp uses the prefixes codice_32 and codice_33. Setting the variables *read-base* and *print-base* to 16 can also be used to switch the reader and printer of a Common Lisp system to Hexadecimal number representation for reading and printing numbers. Thus Hexadecimal numbers can be represented without the #x or #16r prefix code, when the input or output base has been changed to 16.
* MSX BASIC, QuickBASIC, FreeBASIC and Visual Basic prefix hexadecimal numbers with codice_34: codice_35
* BBC BASIC and Locomotive BASIC use codice_36 for hex.
* TI-89 and 92 series uses a codice_37 prefix: codice_38, codice_39
* ALGOL 68 uses the prefix codice_27 to denote hexadecimal numbers: codice_41, codice_42. Binary, quaternary (base-4), and octal numbers can be specified similarly.
* The most common format for hexadecimal on IBM mainframes (zSeries) and midrange computers (IBM i) running the traditional OS&#x27;s (zOS, zVSE, zVM, TPF, IBM i) is codice_43 or codice_44, and is used in Assembler, PL/I, COBOL, JCL, scripts, commands and other places. This format was common on other (and now obsolete) IBM systems as well. Occasionally quotation marks were used instead of apostrophes.

====Syntax that is always Hex====
Sometimes the numbers are known to be Hex.

* In URIs (including URLs), character codes are written as hexadecimal pairs prefixed with : where is the code for the space (blank) character, ASCII code point 20 in hex, 32 in decimal.
* In the Unicode standard, a character value is represented with followed by the hex value, e.g. is the inverted exclamation point (¡).
* Color references in HTML, CSS and X Window can be expressed with six hexadecimal digits (two each for the red, green and blue components, in that order) prefixed with : magenta, for example, is represented as . CSS also allows 3-hexdigit abbreviations with one hexdigit per component: abbreviates (a golden orange: ).
* In MIME (e-mail extensions) quoted-printable encoding, character codes are written as hexadecimal pairs prefixed with : is &quot;España&quot; (F1 is the code for &quot;ñ&quot; in the ISO/IEC 8859-1 character set).)
* PostScript binary data (such as image pixels) can be expressed as unprefixed consecutive hexadecimal pairs:  ...
* Any IPv6 address can be written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits (sometimes called hextets), where each group is separated by a colon (). This, for example, is a valid IPv6 address: or abbreviated by removing leading zeros as (IPv4 addresses are usually written in decimal).
* Globally unique identifiers are written as thirty-two hexadecimal digits, often in unequal hyphen-separated groupings, for example .

===Other symbols for 10–15 and mostly different symbol sets===

The use of the letters &quot;A&quot; through &quot;F&quot; to represent the digits above 9 was not universal in the early history of computers.
* During the 1950s, some installations, such as Bendix-14, favored using the digits 0 through 5 with an overline to denote the values as , , , , and .
* The SWAC (1950) and Bendix G-15 (1956) computers used the lowercase letters &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; for the values 10 to 15.
* The ORDVAC and ILLIAC I (1952) computers (and some derived designs, e.g. BRLESC) used the uppercase letters &quot;K&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;F&quot; and &quot;L&quot; for the values 10 to 15.
* The Librascope LGP-30 (1956) used the letters &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;W&quot; for the values 10 to 15.
* On the PERM (1956) computer, hexadecimal numbers were written as letters &quot;O&quot; for zero, &quot;A&quot; to &quot;N&quot; and &quot;P&quot; for 1 to 15. Many machine instructions had mnemonic hex-codes (&quot;A&quot;=add, &quot;M&quot;=multiply, &quot;L&quot;=load, &quot;F&quot;=fixed-point etc.); programs were written without instruction names.
* The Honeywell Datamatic D-1000 (1957) used the lowercase letters &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, and &quot;g&quot; whereas the Elbit 100 (1967) used the uppercase letters &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; for the values 10 to 15.
* The Monrobot XI (1960) used the letters &quot;S&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;W&quot; and &quot;X&quot; for the values 10 to 15.
* The NEC parametron computer NEAC 1103 (1960) used the letters &quot;D&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot; (and possibly &quot;V&quot;) for values 10–15.
* The Pacific Data Systems 1020 (1964) used the letters &quot;L&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;M&quot; and &quot;D&quot; for the values 10 to 15.
* New numeric symbols and names were introduced in the Bibi-binary notation by Boby Lapointe in 1968.
* Bruce Alan Martin of Brookhaven National Laboratory considered the choice of A–F &quot;ridiculous&quot;. In a 1968 letter to the editor of the CACM, he proposed an entirely new set of symbols based on the bit locations.
* In 1972, Ronald O. Whitaker of Rowco Engineering Co. proposed a triangular font that allows &quot;direct binary reading&quot; to &quot;permit both input and output from computers without respect to encoding matrices.&quot;
* Some seven-segment display decoder chips (i.e., 74LS47) show unexpected output due to logic designed only to produce 0–9 correctly.

===Verbal and digital representations===

Since there were no traditional numerals to represent the quantities from ten to fifteen, alphabetic letters were re-employed as a substitute. Most European languages lack non-decimal-based words for some of the numerals eleven to fifteen. Some people read hexadecimal numbers digit by digit, like a phone number, or using the NATO phonetic alphabet, the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, or a similar &quot;ad-hoc&quot; system. In the wake of the adoption of hexadecimal among IBM System/360 programmers, Magnuson (1968) suggested a pronunciation guide that gave short names to the letters of hexadecimal – for instance, &quot;A&quot; was pronounced &quot;ann&quot;, B &quot;bet&quot;, C &quot;chris&quot;, etc. Another naming-system was published online by Rogers (2007) that tries to make the verbal representation distinguishable in any case, even when the actual number does not contain numbers A–F. Examples are listed in the tables below. Yet another naming system was elaborated by Babb (2015), based on a joke in &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;. The system proposed by Babb was further improved by Atkins-Bittner in 2015-2016.

Others have proposed using the verbal Morse Code conventions to express four-bit hexadecimal digits, with &quot;dit&quot; and &quot;dah&quot; representing zero and one, respectively, so that &quot;0000&quot; is voiced as &quot;dit-dit-dit-dit&quot; (...), dah-dit-dit-dah (-..-) voices the digit with a value of nine, and &quot;dah-dah-dah-dah&quot; (----) voices the hexadecimal digit for decimal 15.

Systems of counting on digits have been devised for both binary and hexadecimal. Arthur C. Clarke suggested using each finger as an on/off bit, allowing finger counting from zero to 102310 on ten fingers. Another system for counting up to FF16 (25510) is illustrated on the right.


===Signs===
The hexadecimal system can express negative numbers the same way as in decimal: −2A to represent −4210, −B01D9 to represent −72136910 and so on.

Hexadecimal can also be used to express the exact bit patterns used in the processor, so a sequence of hexadecimal digits may represent a signed or even a floating-point value. This way, the negative number −4210 can be written as FFFF FFD6 in a 32-bit CPU register (in two&#x27;s complement), as C228 0000 in a 32-bit FPU register or C045 0000 0000 0000 in a 64-bit FPU register (in the IEEE floating-point standard).

===Hexadecimal exponential notation===
Just as decimal numbers can be represented in exponential notation, so too can hexadecimal numbers. P notation uses the letter &quot;P&quot; (or &quot;p&quot;, for &quot;power&quot;), whereas &quot;E&quot; (or &quot;e&quot;) serves a similar purpose in decimal E notation. The number after the &quot;P&quot; is &quot;decimal&quot; and represents the &quot;binary&quot; exponent. Increasing the exponent by 1 multiplies by 2, not 16: . Usually, the number is normalized so that the hexadecimal digits start with (zero is usually with no &quot;P&quot;).

Example: represents .

P notation is required by the IEEE 754-2008 binary floating-point standard and can be used for floating-point literals in the C99 edition of the C programming language.
Using the &quot;%a&quot; or &quot;%A&quot; conversion specifiers, this notation can be produced by implementations of the &quot;printf&quot; family of functions following the C99 specification and
Single Unix Specification (IEEE Std 1003.1) POSIX standard.

==Conversion==

===Binary conversion===
Most computers manipulate binary data, but it is difficult for humans to work with a large number of digits for even a relatively small binary number. Although most humans are familiar with the base 10 system, it is much easier to map binary to hexadecimal than to decimal because each hexadecimal digit maps to a whole number of bits (410).
This example converts 11112 to base ten. Since each position in a binary numeral can contain either a 1 or a 0, its value may be easily determined by its position from the right:

* 00012 = 110
* 00102 = 210
* 01002 = 410
* 10002 = 810

Therefore:

With little practice, mapping 11112 to F16 in one step becomes easy (see table in written representation). The advantage of using hexadecimal rather than decimal increases rapidly with the size of the number. When the number becomes large, conversion to decimal is very tedious. However, when mapping to hexadecimal, it is trivial to regard the binary string as 4-digit groups and map each to a single hexadecimal digit.

This example shows the conversion of a binary number to decimal, mapping each digit to the decimal value, and adding the results.

Compare this to the conversion to hexadecimal, where each group of four digits can be considered independently and converted directly:

The conversion from hexadecimal to binary is equally direct.

===Other simple conversions===

Although quaternary (base 4) is little used, it can easily be converted to and from hexadecimal or binary. Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to a pair of quaternary digits, and each quaternary digit corresponds to a pair of binary digits. In the above example 2 5 C16 = 02 11 304.

The octal (base 8) system can also be converted with relative ease, although not quite as trivially as with bases 2 and 4. Each octal digit corresponds to three binary digits, rather than four. Therefore, we can convert between octal and hexadecimal via an intermediate conversion to binary followed by regrouping the binary digits in groups of either three or four.

===Division-remainder in source base===
As with all bases there is a simple algorithm for converting a representation of a number to hexadecimal by doing integer division and remainder operations in the source base. In theory, this is possible from any base, but for most humans, only decimal and for most computers, only binary (which can be converted by far more efficient methods) can be easily handled with this method.

Let d be the number to represent in hexadecimal, and the series hihi−1...h2h1 be the hexadecimal digits representing the number.

# i ← 1
# hi ← d mod 16
# d ← (d − hi) / 16
# If d = 0 (return series hi) else increment i and go to step 2

&quot;16&quot; may be replaced with any other base that may be desired.

The following is a JavaScript implementation of the above algorithm for converting any number to a hexadecimal in String representation. Its purpose is to illustrate the above algorithm. To work with data seriously, however, it is much more advisable to work with bitwise operators.
function toHex(d) {
 var r = d % 16;
 if (d - r == 0) {
 return toChar(r);
 return toHex((d - r) / 16) + toChar(r);

function toChar(n) {
 const alpha = &quot;0123456789ABCDEF&quot;;
 return alpha.charAt(n);


===Conversion through addition and multiplication===

It is also possible to make the conversion by assigning each place in the source base the hexadecimal representation of its place value — before carrying out multiplication and addition to get the final representation.
For example, to convert the number B3AD to decimal, one can split the hexadecimal number into its digits: B (1110), 3 (310), A (1010) and D (1310), and then get the final result by multiplying each decimal representation by 16&quot;p&quot; (&quot;p&quot; being the corresponding hex digit position, counting from right to left, beginning with 0). In this case, we have that:

which is 45997 in base 10.

===Tools for conversion===
Many computer systems provide a calculator utility capable of performing conversions between the various radices frequently including hexadecimal.

In Microsoft Windows, the Calculator, on its Programmer mode, allows conversions between hexadecimal and other common programming bases.

== Elementary arithmetic ==
Elementary operations such as division can be carried out indirectly through conversion to an alternate numeral system, such as the commonly used decimal system or the binary system where each hex digit corresponds to four binary digits.

Alternatively, one can also perform elementary operations directly within the hex system itself — by relying on its addition/multiplication tables and its corresponding standard algorithms such as long division and the traditional subtraction algorithm.

==Real numbers==

=== Rational numbers ===
As with other numeral systems, the hexadecimal system can be used to represent rational numbers, although repeating expansions are common since sixteen (1016) has only a single prime factor: two.

For any base, 0.1 (or &quot;1/10&quot;) is always equivalent to one divided by the representation of that base value in its own number system. Thus, whether dividing one by two for binary or dividing one by sixteen for hexadecimal, both of these fractions are written as codice_45. Because the radix 16 is a perfect square (42), fractions expressed in hexadecimal have an odd period much more often than decimal ones, and there are no cyclic numbers (other than trivial single digits). Recurring digits are exhibited when the denominator in lowest terms has a prime factor not found in the radix; thus, when using hexadecimal notation, all fractions with denominators that are not a power of two result in an infinite string of recurring digits (such as thirds and fifths). This makes hexadecimal (and binary) less convenient than decimal for representing rational numbers since a larger proportion lies outside its range of finite representation.

All rational numbers finitely representable in hexadecimal are also finitely representable in decimal, duodecimal and sexagesimal: that is, any hexadecimal number with a finite number of digits also has a finite number of digits when expressed in those other bases. Conversely, only a fraction of those finitely representable in the latter bases are finitely representable in hexadecimal. For example, decimal 0.1 corresponds to the infinite recurring representation 0.1 in hexadecimal. However, hexadecimal is more efficient than duodecimal and sexagesimal for representing fractions with powers of two in the denominator. For example, 0.062510 (one-sixteenth) is equivalent to 0.116, 0.0912, and 0;3,4560.

===Irrational numbers===
The table below gives the expansions of some common irrational numbers in decimal and hexadecimal.
===Powers===
Powers of two have very simple expansions in hexadecimal. The first sixteen powers of two are shown below.
==Cultural history==
The traditional Chinese units of measurement were base-16. For example, one jīn (斤) in the old system equals sixteen taels. The suanpan (Chinese abacus) can be used to perform hexadecimal calculations such as additions and subtractions.

As with the duodecimal system, there have been occasional attempts to promote hexadecimal as the preferred numeral system. These attempts often propose specific pronunciation and symbols for the individual numerals. Some proposals unify standard measures so that they are multiples of 16.
An early such proposal was put forward by John W. Nystrom in &quot;Project of a New System of Arithmetic, Weight, Measure and Coins: Proposed to be called the Tonal System, with Sixteen to the Base&quot;, published in 1862.
Nystrom among other things suggested hexadecimal time, which subdivides a day by 16, 
so that there are 16 &quot;hours&quot; (or &quot;10 &quot;tims&quot;&quot;, pronounced &quot;tontim&quot;) in a day.
The word &quot;hexadecimal&quot; is first recorded in 1952. It is macaronic in the sense that it combines Greek ἕξ (hex) &quot;six&quot; with Latinate &quot;-decimal&quot;.
The all-Latin alternative &quot;sexadecimal&quot; (compare the word &quot;sexagesimal&quot; for base 60) is older, and sees at least occasional use from the late 19th century.
It is still in use in the 1950s in Bendix documentation.
Schwartzman (1994) argues that use of &quot;sexadecimal&quot; may have been avoided because of its suggestive abbreviation to &quot;sex&quot;.
Many western languages since the 1960s have adopted terms equivalent in formation to &quot;hexadecimal&quot; (e.g. French &quot;hexadécimal&quot;, Italian &quot;esadecimale&quot;, Romanian &quot;hexazecimal&quot;, Serbian &quot;хексадецимални&quot;, etc.)
but others have introduced terms which substitute native words for &quot;sixteen&quot; (e.g. Greek δεκαεξαδικός, Icelandic &quot;sextándakerfi&quot;, Russian &quot;шестнадцатеричной&quot; etc.)

Terminology and notation did not become settled until the end of the 1960s. 
In 1969, Donald Knuth argued that the etymologically correct term would be &quot;senidenary&quot;, or possibly &quot;sedenary&quot;, a Latinate term intended to convey &quot;grouped by 16&quot; modelled on &quot;binary&quot;, &quot;ternary&quot;, &quot;quaternary&quot;, etc.
According to Knuth&#x27;s argument, the correct terms for &quot;decimal&quot; and &quot;octal&quot; arithmetic would be &quot;denary&quot; and &quot;octonary&quot;, respectively. 
Alfred B. Taylor used &quot;senidenary&quot; in his mid-1800s work on alternative number bases, although he rejected base 16 because of its &quot;incommodious number of digits&quot;.

The now-current notation using the letters A to F establishes itself as the de facto standard beginning in 1966, in the wake of the 
publication of the Fortran IV manual for IBM System/360, which (unlike earlier variants of Fortran) recognizes a standard for entering hexadecimal constants.
As noted above, alternative notations were used by NEC (1960) and The Pacific Data Systems 1020 (1964). The standard adopted by IBM seems to have become widely adopted by 1968, when Bruce Alan Martin
in his letter to the editor of the CACM complains that

Martin&#x27;s argument was that use of numerals 0 to 9 in nondecimal numbers &quot;imply to us a base-ten place-value scheme&quot;:
&quot;Why not use entirely new symbols (and names) for the seven or fifteen nonzero digits needed in octal or hex. Even use of the letters A through P would be an improvement, but entirely new symbols could reflect the binary nature of the system&quot;.
He also argued that &quot;re-using alphabetic letters for numerical digits represents a gigantic backward step from the invention of distinct, non-alphabetic glyphs for numerals sixteen centuries ago&quot; (as Brahmi numerals, and later in a Hindu–Arabic numeral system), 
and that the recent ASCII standards (ASA X3.4-1963 and USAS X3.4-1968) 
&quot;should have preserved six code table positions following the ten decimal digits 
-- rather than needlessly filling these with punctuation characters&quot;
(&quot;:;&lt;=&gt;?&quot;) that might have been placed elsewhere among the 128 available positions.

==Base16 (transfer encoding)==
Base16 (as a proper name without a space) can also refer to a binary to text encoding belonging to the same family as Base32, Base58, and Base64.

In this case, data is broken into 4-bit sequences, and each value (between 0 and 15 inclusively) is encoded using one of 16 symbols from the ASCII character set. Although any 16 symbols from the ASCII character set can be used, in practice, the ASCII digits &quot;0&quot;–&quot;9&quot; and the letters &quot;A&quot;–&quot;F&quot; (or the lowercase &quot;a&quot;–&quot;f&quot;) are always chosen in order to align with standard written notation for hexadecimal numbers.

There are several advantages of Base16 encoding:
* Most programming languages already have facilities to parse ASCII-encoded hexadecimal
* Being exactly half a byte, 4-bits is easier to process than the 5 or 6 bits of Base32 and Base64 respectively
* The symbols 0–9 and A–F are universal in hexadecimal notation, so it is easily understood at a glance without needing to rely on a symbol lookup table.
* Many CPU architectures have dedicated instructions that allow access to a half-byte (otherwise known as a &quot;nibble&quot;), making it more efficient in hardware than Base32 and Base64

The main disadvantages of Base16 encoding are:
* Space efficiency is only 50%, since each 4-bit value from the original data will be encoded as an 8-bit byte. In contrast, Base32 and Base64 encodings have a space efficiency of 63% and 75% respectively.
* Possible added complexity of having to accept both uppercase and lowercase letters

Support for Base16 encoding is ubiquitous in modern computing. It is the basis for the W3C standard for URL percent encoding, where a character is replaced with a percent sign &quot;%&quot; and its Base16-encoded form. Most modern programming languages directly include support for formatting and parsing Base16-encoded numbers.
